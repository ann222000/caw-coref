In '94, a formerly high ranking official talked about what it would be
like if the US had gone to Baghdad during GWI.

(from memory, sorta paraphrased.)
&quot;After you take down Saddam's government, what are you going to put in
its place?&quot;
&quot;You see parts of Iraq flying off. The west to Syria. The east to
Iran. The Kurds in the North, if they join the Kurds in Turkey, you
begin to threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey.&quot;
&quot;How many American lives is it worth to take down Saddam Hussein? Not
very many.&quot;
&quot;We would be all alone. None of the Arab countries that were fighting
with us in Kuwait would have gone with us to Iraq.&quot;

(sorry for the sloppy transcript)

This official nailed it on all counts.  He did it nearly ten years
before the real deal. Who was the genius? Dick &quot;Go Fuck Yourself&quot;
Cheney.

No, I'm not fucking with you. Watch the video here.

None of the above claims are news at all. It was the standard line for
why the US didn't go to Baghdad in 1991. Of course I remember that
people who hated Bush Sr (I'd use the term Liberals but that seems to
not be allowed around here) saying that the then genocide of the Kurds
and the Shia, specifically the Marsh Arabs, was then Bush Sr's fault
because he egged them on, caused them to revolt and didn't help, boy is
Bush bad.

So Bush Sr tried to help and set up the no-fly zones. This allowed the
Kurds to return to their homes instead of camping just outside of Turkey
like they were on a bloody vacation, like they were on a bloody
vacation. It also sort of protected the Shia from at least the air
attacks in the south, not really helping the Marsh Arabs that much
because Saddam had an environmental crime against nature to pull, the
diversion of the water from the marshes. And the people of Somalia were
starving and there was civil war and it was asked by the same
complainers why Bush Sr saved the rich (apparently not worth anything to
those complainers) Kuwaitis but was just letting the Somalis starve. So
late in his term, Bush Sr invaded Somalia with the sole job of providing
food aid.

But ultimately none of this changed the fundamental situation in the
region and after eight years of essentially the status quo under
Clinton, Bush Jr took over and was hit with the 9/11 attacks. His first
response was to directly engage the enemy in Afghanistan but his next
major effort was to try to engage the underlying problem, the
hopelessness of the Middle East. In the intervening years, Saddam had
not moderated, the people of Iraq were still under his thumb, Iraq was
clearly a failed state.

One fear in the Middle East of democracy is that the people will vote in
an Iranian style theocratic dictatorship with a nominal democratic one
showing its face to the world. These sorts of governments are dangerous
when they are fundamentalist and they tend only to be possible if they
are fundamentalist. It turns out that Iraq, being a mixture of the two
great Islamic traditions, Shiism and Sunnism, a mixture of ethnic and
language groups, Arab and Kurd and others, is about the best choice
going for not turning into such a fundamentalist threat. That can't be
said for, for example, Saudi Arabia.

How many American lives are worth Iraq? Clearly the calculus depends on
what you think that Iraq is really about. If you decide it is about Bush
stealing oil for Cheney's buddies or something like that, you'll likely
conclude it's not worth very many. If you decide that Iraq was a mistake
because once in the US couldn't find those WMDs, you'll conclude that
it's not worth very many. But if you decide that Iraq is the centre of
the world right now for dealing with the bin Ladenist hypernihilist
threat that you've also concluded is the greatest threat to the future
of mankind, you'll decide that Iraq is worth standing for.

Who is the police? In a world based on the Westphalian nation state,
it's the nation states that act in their individual interests that must
do the policing. To the degree they delegate that to a &quot;League of
Nations&quot; or a &quot;United Nations&quot;, I suppose that's somewhat acceptable. I
still think though that ultimately it's individual nation states.

If anyone here is being naïve, it's the one who's pretending that the
nations of the Middle East don't look right at the US when they need
something including help finding peace. They certainly don't seem to
able to go it alone. When Katrinia devastated New Orleans and the US
wasn't able to help its own citizens right away, many people around the
globe looked shocked. Maybe some day people will admit in their hearts
that we are all in this together and no one nation can do it all.

&quot;Because if we'd gone to Baghdad, we would have been all alone.  There
wouldn't have been anybody else with us — it would have been a US occupation
of Iraq.  None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in
Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq.  Once you got to Iraq and took it over,
and took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in
its place?  That's a very volatile part of the world.

&quot;And if you take down the central government in Iraq, you could easily end
up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off.  Part of it … uh … the Syrians would like
to have in the West.  Part of the eastern part of Iraq the Iranians would
like to claim, fought over it for eight years.  In the north, you've got the
Kurds.  If the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you
threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey.  It's a … it's a quagmire, if
you go that far in trying to take over Iraq.

&quot;The other thing was casualties.  Uh … everyone was impressed with that fact
that … uh … we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But
for the 146 Americans killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a
cheap war.  And the question for the President in terms of whether or not we
went on to Baghdad and took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam
Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans was Saddam worth? And our
judgment was not very many, and I think we got that right.&quot;

Those guys in Glasgow who'd taken an oath to do no harm? I shouldn't
think so. Of course I felt that way about the whole lot of them until
9/11. I've said before that most of the attacks against the US at least
will fail because it is difficult for bin Laden supporters to bridge the
gap from the Old World to the New. The culture is different, the
languages are different, the distances make it more difficult.

Consider the ferry bomber who was caught because he was acting strange
because he'd caught malaria in Afghanistan. So there's reason to argue
that we can stop them. But the trouble is that every once in a while you
find people who are both crazy and capable. That's how we got 9/11. I
don't want that to happen again, and God forbid I don't want it to
happen with nuclear weapons or some sort of engineered biological
weapon.

I wrote in another group to a person advocating genocide against
Muslims:

#begin quote other group ME
HIM&gt; What's wrong with eliminating bad people like the muslim
pukes...???

ME&gt; You are clearly convinced that the hypernihilist threat is limited
to
&quot;muslim pukes&quot; which you then expand to all Muslims and conclude the
genocide of a billion or more people is the answer. I suspect that your
cure is worse than the curse. And I know that hypernihilism isn't
limited to Muslims. We've all seen Jim Jones, which was a Christian
cult. And not to limit it to religion, the group that dumped sarin in
the Japanese subway, Aum Shinri Kyo, was essentially a technology and
science cult. Think about that, the very basis of our rationality, the
Enlightenment, our intelligence subverted to our destruction by
hypernihilists.

ME&gt; I think I'd rather take on the Muslim cultists who want to return to
the
11th century than a group that is dissatisfied with their Nintendos. For
one thing, I suspect that when people see what it was like in the 11th
century, they will recoil. It's not clear that they won't be
legitimately unhappy with some aspects of the 21st century, so that
might resonate. How do you convince a suicidal person that life is worth
living? That might not be hard compared to convincing the same person
twisted into hypernihilism why his solution, killing us all with a
nuclear weapon or biological terror, is an error.

Cheney may well have not agreed with that official line, but he was a
