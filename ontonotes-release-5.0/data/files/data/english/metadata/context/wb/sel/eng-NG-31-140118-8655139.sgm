That's what was on the marquee at the Seventh Day Adventist
Church this morning as I drove by.  It was especially funny to
me because I had just finished reading _The God Delusion_
the day before. . . .

Magic Johnson was raised a Seventh-Day Adventist. Not sure if he's
a creationist or anything, but members of his immediate family are
reportedly still active in the SDA Church. (Not sure about Kareem -
a Sunni Muslim - but many Muslims are also creationists.)

http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2006/01/talking_with_ka_1.html

Andrew Kamenetzky: During the Showtime era, there were always
reports of you and Magic not getting along at times, or not being
particularly close. But it never blew up the way things did for Shaq
and Kobe. Is that the result of you guys handling it differently? A
different media age?

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, first of all, we never had any personal
animosity. Magic's family more or less kind of adopted me. Magic's
mother is a Seventh-Day Adventist and they're kind of a lot like
Muslims in that they don't eat pork and stuff. When I first met her,
we talked about that. And she said, &quot;Well, I'm gonna take care of
you every time you come through Michigan.&quot; And she always cooked
for me. I felt like a part of their family.

...I am an SDA and have been involved in the community for many
years (35+). My father has been an SDA minister for over 50 years
and currently lives in Arizona. Magic Johnson was raised SDA in
Michigan. His mother and sisters are still active members of the
SDA church. Magic's mother visits California frequently and is
always found in the local church where I met her on many occasions.

Actually, what is fascinating about morality from an evolutionary-
biology standpoint, is that morality is not mutable; or to put it
differently, we are hard-wired for morality by evolution.  Morality
does not come from religions or other belief systems.  It is innate;
a behavioral response shaped by evolution to ennsure our species
survival.  Some very good research confirms this.  Here's an
interesting link:

These types of things are seldom of any use.  To
quote Michael Shermer (on why he won't debate
creationists any longer):

The problem is that this is not an intellectual
exercise, it is an emotional drama. For
scientists, the dramatis personae are
evolutionists v. creationists, the former of
whom have an impregnable fortress of evidence
that converges to an unmistakable conclusion;
for creationists, however, the evidence is
irrelevant. This is a spiritual war, whose
combatants are theists v. atheists,
spiritualists v. secularists, Christians v.
Satanists, godfearing capitalists v. godless
communists, good v. evil. With stakes this
high, and an audience so stacked, what chance
does any scientist have in such a venue?

The problem with such a &quot;seminar&quot; is that weak
arguments can be presented (esp. in a venue
such as this where they're literally preaching
to the choir) without refutation.  As a result,
fallacious and long-refuted arguments are still
being ridden for all they're worth.  I'd invite
everyone to read this recent blog post by
Steven Novella, addressing someone's &quot;Ten Major
Flaws of Evolution.&quot;

&lt; http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=5 &gt;

When the arguments are presented in a venue
where the standards of evidence are high, and
the creationists don't get to resort to their
usual tactics, the results of course are
entirely different:

A couple things.  First, the innate drive is to carry the gene
forward.  Everything else is in service to that end.  So, it
makes sense for the innate morality to apply to one's own
group, as the group's survival enhances the chances of the
individual's survival--and in turn, their offspring.  You are
correct in pointing out that this &quot;morality&quot; does not apply
to those outside the group (tribe, clan, etc.), unless their
is some survival benefit attached.  I'm not sure, however,
what you mean by saying that &quot;cooperative survival within
small groups or tribes only developed billions of years later.&quot;
Clearly non-humans, such as our close primate relatives,
depend on cooperative group dynamics in order to survive.
In fact, we could walk a long ways down the evolutionary
road and find many examples of cooperative behavior among
species far older than ours.  Were you using &quot;billions&quot; loosely?

Not at all. It's not a surprise that our &quot;close primate relatives&quot; would
have similar survival traits. It's also not unlikely that as we
diverged, we may have lost some cooperative traits as resources came
under greater competition. My point was merely that a species-wide
survival instinct would not be explained by human evolution and likely
does not exist. You seem to have agreed with that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; throughout, but he's particularly insightful in his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critique of religious moderates.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All anyone needs to know about any religion is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religion is myth based superstition and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supernatural
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exists only in the human imagination.  I can see the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moral
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; utility of religion, but it lacks intellectual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; validity,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it's really unnecessary because there are rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moral
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; systems that don't exercise mental tyranny to suppress
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free will to the point of oppression in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enforce moral behavior.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Notwithstanding the proselytizing of some religions, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; universal religion is impossible because all history
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shown that morality is mobile and mutable:  it changes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from time to time, place to place, group to group, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, what is fascinating about morality from an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolutionary- biology standpoint, is that morality is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not mutable; or to put it differently, we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard-wired
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for morality by evolution.  Morality does not come from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religions or other belief systems.  It is innate;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a behavioral response shaped by evolution to ennsure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; species survival.  Some very good research confirms
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this.  Here's an interesting link:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This type of &quot;morality&quot; only applies within the tribe or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group. It does not apply to &quot;the other.&quot; In your own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms, we are &quot;hard-wired by evolution&quot; to hate and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distrust &quot;the other.&quot; This comes from billions of years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of competing for limited resources. ANd it explains why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people in general, and religions in particular are so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intolerant. BTW, there is nothing in human evolution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would predelict towards species survival. Individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; survival is first and foremost from an evolutionary pov
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and cooperative survival within small groups or tribes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only developes billions of years later.  &gt; Of course,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  all that said, intellect can overcome &gt; instinct. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;  only if you have a stong enough intellect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A couple things.  First, the innate drive is to carry
&gt;&gt;&gt; the gene forward.  Everything else is in service to that
&gt;&gt;&gt; end.  So, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; makes sense for the innate morality to apply to one's own
&gt;&gt;&gt; group, as the group's survival enhances the chances of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the individual's survival--and in turn, their offspring.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You are
&gt;&gt;&gt; correct in pointing out that this &quot;morality&quot; does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply
&gt;&gt;&gt; to those outside the group (tribe, clan, etc.), unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt; is some survival benefit attached.  I'm not sure,
&gt;&gt;&gt; however,
&gt;&gt;&gt; what you mean by saying that &quot;cooperative survival within
&gt;&gt;&gt; small groups or tribes only developed billions of years
&gt;&gt;&gt; later.&quot; Clearly non-humans, such as our close primate
&gt;&gt;&gt; relatives,
&gt;&gt;&gt; depend on cooperative group dynamics in order to survive.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, we could walk a long ways down the evolutionary
&gt;&gt;&gt; road and find many examples of cooperative behavior among
&gt;&gt;&gt; species far older than ours.  Were you using &quot;billions&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; loosely?

&gt;&gt;&gt; bryguy

&gt;&gt;&gt; (Did Beeze have a Goldorkian moment of hypebolic excess?)

&gt;&gt; Not at all. It's not a surprise that our &quot;close primate
&gt;&gt; relatives&quot; would have similar survival traits. It's also
&gt;&gt; not unlikely that as we diverged, we may have lost some
&gt;&gt; cooperative traits as resources came under greater
&gt;&gt; competition. My point was merely that a species-wide
&gt;&gt; survival instinct would not be explained by human
&gt;&gt; evolution and likely does not exist. You seem to have
&gt;&gt; agreed with that.

&gt; I agree that we cannot parse out any specifically human
&gt; survival instinct--but the instinct to survive--in order to
&gt; reproduce--is within us as it is in all species (we simply
&gt; would die off without it).
">

Indeed it is within use as a species - but it does not apply to us as a
species. What you are talking about is altruism - putting the survival
of others above (at least on a par with) your own. Nothing in human
evolution would indicate such an instinct. Survival of the self is an
evolutionary instinct. But, as I said originally, intellect can overcome
instinct.

Reviewed by Stephen Prothero
A century and a half ago Pope Pius IX published the Syllabus of
Errors, a rhetorical tour de force against the high crimes and
misdemeanors of the modern world. God Is Not Great, by the British
journalist and professional provocateur Christopher Hitchens, is the
atheists' equivalent: an unrelenting enumeration of religion's sins
and wickedness, written with much of the rhetorical pomp and all of
the imperial condescension of a Vatican encyclical.

Hitchens, who once described Mother Teresa as &quot;a fanatic, a
fundamentalist, and a fraud,&quot; is notorious for making mincemeat out of
sacred cows, but in this book it is the sacred itself that is
skewered. Religion, Hitchens writes, is &quot;violent, irrational,
intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in
ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and
coercive toward children.&quot; Channeling the anti-supernatural spirits of
other acolytes of the &quot;new atheism,&quot; Hitchens argues that religion is
&quot;man-made&quot; and murderous, originating in fear and sustained by brute
force. Like Richard Dawkins, he denounces the religious education of
young people as child abuse. Like Sam Harris, he fires away at the
Koran as well as the Bible. And like Daniel Dennett, he views faith as
wish-fulfillment.

Historian George Marsden once described fundamentalism as
evangelicalism that is mad about something. If so, these evangelistic
atheists have something in common with their fundamentalist foes, and
Hitchens is the maddest of the lot. Protestant theologian John Calvin
was &quot;a sadist and torturer and killer,&quot; Hitchens writes, and the Bible
&quot;contain[s] a warrant for trafficking in humans, for ethnic cleansing,
for slavery, for bride-price, and for indiscriminate massacre.&quot;

As should be obvious to any reasonable person -- unlike Hitchens I do
not exclude believers from this category -- horrors and good deeds are
performed by believers and non-believers alike. But in Hitchens's
Manichaean world, religion does little good and secularism hardly any
evil. Indeed, Hitchens arrives at the conclusion that the secular
murderousness of Stalin's purges wasn't really secular at all, since,
as he quotes George Orwell, &quot;a totalitarian state is in effect a
theocracy.&quot; And in North Korea today, what has gone awry is not
communism but Confucianism.

Hitchens is not so forgiving when it comes to religion's
transgressions. He aims his poison pen at the Dalai Lama, St. Francis
and Gandhi. Among religious leaders only the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. comes off well. But in the gospel according to Hitchens whatever
good King did accrues to his humanism rather than his Christianity. In
fact, King was not actually a Christian at all, argues Hitchens, since
he rejected the sadism that characterizes the teachings of Jesus. &quot;No
supernatural force was required to make the case against racism&quot; in
postwar America, writes Hitchens. But he's wrong. It was the prophetic
faith of black believers that gave them the strength to stand up to
the indignities of fire hoses and police dogs. As for those white
liberals inspired by Paine, Mencken and Hitchens's other secular
heroes, well, they stood down.

Hitchens says a lot of true things in this wrongheaded book. He is
right that you can be moral without being religious. He is right to
track contemporary sexism and sexual repression to ancient religious
beliefs. And his attack on &quot;intelligent design&quot; is not only convincing
but comical, coursing as it does through the crude architecture of the
appendix and our inconvenient &quot;urinogenital arrangements.&quot;

What Hitchens gets wrong is religion itself.

Hitchens claims that some of his best friends are believers. If so, he
doesn't know much about his best friends. He writes about religious
people the way northern racists used to talk about &quot;Negroes&quot; -- with
feigned knowing and a sneer. God Is Not Great assumes a childish
definition of religion and then criticizes religious people for
believing such foolery. But it is Hitchens who is the naïf. To read
this oddly innocent book as gospel is to believe that ordinary
Catholics are proud of the Inquisition, that ordinary Hindus view
masturbation as an offense against Krishna, and that ordinary Jews
cheer when a renegade Orthodox rebbe sucks the blood off a freshly
circumcised penis. It is to believe that faith is always blind and
rituals always empty -- that there is no difference between taking
communion and drinking the Kool-Aid (a beverage Hitchens feels
compelled to mention no fewer than three times).

If this is religion, then by all means we should have less of it. But
the only people who believe that religion is about believing blindly
in a God who blesses and curses on demand and sees science and reason
as spawns of Satan are unlettered fundamentalists and their atheistic
doppelgangers. Hitchens describes the religious mind as &quot;literal and
limited&quot; and the atheistic mind as &quot;ironic and inquiring.&quot; Readers
with any sense of irony -- and here I do not exclude believers -- will
be surprised to see how little inquiring Hitchens has done and how
limited and literal is his own ill-prepared reduction of religion.

Christopher Hitchens is a brilliant man, and there is no living
journalist I more enjoy reading. But I have never encountered a book
whose author is so fundamentally unacquainted with its subject. In the
end, this maddeningly dogmatic book does little more than illustrate
one of Hitchens's pet themes -- the ability of dogma to put reason to
sleep.

In my opinion, the review is not so much inaccurate as it is based on
false expectations. If you know (and like, as the reviewer seems to
do) Hitchens and see the title of the book, I think you should get an
idea of what to expect.

I'll just pick a piece of the review to illustrate what I mean:

[...]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Gospel? Not only is it an amusing choice of word, it indicates what I
mean with wrong expectation. The book is scathing and polemic at
times, sure. But at that it is intelligent, extremely well written and
very personal (note that his friendship with Salman Rushdie is one of
his drivers on the topic).

It certainly is not a &quot;balanced&quot; look at religion, but I
didn't expect that from Hitchens and that book.

This review is closer to how I see the book: &lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Kinsley-t.html?pagewan... &gt;

I don't think it's an analogy that applies.  Casting aside
the tacit pejorative of &quot;virginal nerd,&quot; Fred's analogy is
to someone discussing an aspect of something which he has
never experienced, and therefore is not qualified to discuss.
(Although it's not necessary for my point, I'd even take
issue with the premise of this assertion.  For example, even
if Alfred Kinsey had been a virgin, he still would have
been more qualified to discuss what women like in bed than
99.9% of the guys out there.)  He then compares this to
athiests and anti-theists dicsussing faith.  Is it his
assertion that for someone to be an anti-theist or athiest,
he must never have experienced faith?  Even an athiest has
faith in many things -- it's just that God isn't among them.
In addition, many non-theists were once hard core believers
(eg: Michael Shermer), so this can't be applied to them,
either.  And further still, is it necessary to experience
faith to understand it?  Who is more likely to have an
accurate perspective on unicorn belief, those with faith
in unicorns, or those outside that particular belief
system?

Myself, I have faith in lots of things, and I have no
problem with faith in general.  Nor do I have a problem
with faith in God.  I'm a skeptic, but I adhere to
scientific skepticism -- when through faith one makes
testable claims, then by all means let's put those
claims to the test.  Do you claim that the Earth is
6,000 years old?  That evolution didn't occur?  Those
are testable claims, and science has established the
falsehood of those claims to a level indistinguishable
from fact[1].  Further, when one has faith that is based
on fallacious reasoning, then that reasoning (and therefore
the resulting faith) is also open to scrutiny.

[1] I used this particular choice of words rather than
&quot;proof&quot; because science, unlike mathematics, doesn't
deal in proof.  While assertions aren't proved in a
literal sense, they -are- established to a level of
certainty indistinguishable from fact, and thus it
would be silly to treat them as anything *but* fact.

All religion is based on the fallacious reasoning that the
supernatural exists independently of the human imagination.
Anyone who doesn't have a problem with faith in such a
fallacy is either not thinking rationally or is trying to
avoid social opprobrium by claiming they have faith but they
also have doubts (a logical impossibility) and calling
themselves &quot;skeptics&quot; or &quot;agnostics&quot; rather than atheists.

You write this under a nym Johnny?

Agnostics
Madalyn Murray O'Hair
Charles Bradlaugh was the first militant Atheist in the history of Western
civilization. He was elected to the British parliament six times, and each
time that body refused to seat him because he was an Atheist -- and because
he would not swear his allegiance to queen and country, so help him &quot;God.&quot;
Everyone in England knew Bradlaugh and his fight, and he raised the issue of
Atheism to every person in public life as he sought allies.

The intellectual community contained, at the time, Sir Thomas Huxley, and he
coined the word agnostic in 1869 to keep from aligning himself with the
hard-pressed Bradlaugh. The word gnosis is the Greek for &quot;knowledge.&quot; In
words of Greek derivation the prefix a is a privative, that is -- it gives
the word a negative sense. Literally it means &quot;against knowledge&quot; or
&quot;negating knowledge.&quot; Huxley in his letters to the literate community
pointed out that he did not feel that salvation could be attained through
knowledge.

We don't know what &quot;salvation&quot; is. But we do know that Huxley referred to
the New Testament biblical story of Acts 17:23 wherein Paul visited Athens
and admonished the people for a statue he found there. He said, &quot;as I passed
by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription 'to the
unknown God' . . .&quot;

Huxley held that there was a &quot;god&quot; and this was implicit in his definition
of agnosticism. He said two things which are quite different:

1. God is -- and God is unknown.
2. God is -- and God is unknowable.

Agnosticism is very close to the religious dogma that the ways of god are
unfathomable, that human reason is fallible, and that man requires a
different, non-scientific, path to the truth -- such as faith. Agnostic
followers are always allies of the church. The false notion that anything is
unknowable undermines science and reinforces theology. It inclines man to
faith and induces men to trust religious doctrines. The church does not
anathematize the agnostic and even the Roman Catholic church will accept the
agnostic in its fold.

Popularly, the word agnostic has been corrupted (just as the words Atheist
and Epicurian have been corrupted) to mean to the man in the street, &quot;I
don't know whether there is a god or not.&quot; But an inspection of that
sentence leads one into accepting the logic of Huxley above.

The Atheist position is that the traditionalist historical concepts of god
are quite fallacious and that the notion of some &quot;super power&quot; is not now
susceptible of proof by existing scientific methods or by the accumulation
of knowledge presently accessible to man. Therefore the Atheists live as if
there were no god, no efficacy in prayer, and no life after death. We are
free from theism. We bet everything on this as being accurate.

The agnostic is gutless and prefers to keep one safe foot in the god camp.

&quot;Evolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science.
Evolution is promulgated as an ideology, a secular religion, a full-
fledged alternative to Christianity, with meaning and morality. I am
an ardent evolutionist and an ex-Christian, but I must admit that in
this one complaint...the literalists are absolutely right. Evolution is
a religion. This was true of evolution in the beginning, and it is true
of evolution still today.... Evolution therefore came into being as a
kind of secular ideology, an explicit substitute for Christianity.&quot;

--Michael Ruse, &quot;National Post&quot; (May 13, 2000)
http://www.fsu.edu/~philo/new%20site/staff/ruse.htm

&quot;We take the side of science /in spite/ of the patent absurdity of
some of its constructs, /in spite/ of its failure to fulfill many of
its extravagant promises of health and life, /in spite/ of the toler-
ance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories,
because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism.

It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel
us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the
contrary, that we are forced by our /a priori/ adherence to material
causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts
that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no
matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism
is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.&quot;

--Richard Lewontin, &quot;The New York Review&quot; (January 9, 1997)
Emphasis in original.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin

&quot;But the simple fact of the matter is that, use language as you like or
not, the fact remains that for many evolutionists – some Darwinian and
some not – evolution does function as a secular religion. The creation-
ists are right about this. The right move is to recognize this fact and
to move forward, not to deny it.&quot;

&gt; Larry:

&gt; Fantastic post.  Thanks for pointing me to Michael Shermer.
&gt; Your footnote on &quot;proof&quot; with respect to science is excellent.
&gt; And one more thing:  I read your post to my wife inc. the &quot;PS&quot;--
&gt; which she enjoyed.  In her words, &quot;smart is sexy.&quot;

Indeed. It is a fundamental misunderstanding of what &quot;proof&quot; means in
natural science that leads the sheeple to say that &quot;evolution is just a
theory. It is not proved.&quot;

&gt; I don't think it's an analogy that applies.  Casting aside
&gt; the tacit pejorative of &quot;virginal nerd,&quot; Fred's analogy is
&gt; to someone discussing an aspect of something which he has
&gt; never experienced, and therefore is not qualified to discuss.
&gt; (Although it's not necessary for my point, I'd even take
&gt; issue with the premise of this assertion.  For example, even
&gt; if Alfred Kinsey had been a virgin, he still would have
&gt; been more qualified to discuss what women like in bed than
&gt; 99.9% of the guys out there.)  He then compares this to
&gt; athiests and anti-theists dicsussing faith.  Is it his
&gt; assertion that for someone to be an anti-theist or athiest,
&gt; he must never have experienced faith?  Even an athiest has
&gt; faith in many things -- it's just that God isn't among them.
&gt; In addition, many non-theists were once hard core believers
&gt; (eg: Michael Shermer), so this can't be applied to them,
&gt; either.  And further still, is it necessary to experience
&gt; faith to understand it?  Who is more likely to have an
&gt; accurate perspective on unicorn belief, those with faith
&gt; in unicorns, or those outside that particular belief
&gt; system?

&gt; Myself, I have faith in lots of things, and I have no
&gt; problem with faith in general.  Nor do I have a problem
&gt; with faith in God.  I'm a skeptic, but I adhere to
&gt; scientific skepticism -- when through faith one makes
&gt; testable claims, then by all means let's put those
&gt; claims to the test.  Do you claim that the Earth is
&gt; 6,000 years old?  That evolution didn't occur?  Those
&gt; are testable claims, and science has established the
&gt; falsehood of those claims to a level indistinguishable
&gt; from fact[1].  Further, when one has faith that is based
&gt; on fallacious reasoning, then that reasoning (and therefore
&gt; the resulting faith) is also open to scrutiny.

There are different kinds of faith.

I have faith that if Jay Leno has Robin Williams on as a guest, it's
going to be a funny show (at least 99% of the time).

I have no faith in the statements of others that claim the bible is
fact or that a god exists when I know that they couldn't possibly
know this to be true other than by taking the word of someone else
that it is.

In one case my faith is due to prior experience with the subject matter
and with the other, I'm forced to take some idiot's word for it that
has no rational reason to even believe it himself.  In one case my
faith is justified - in the other it's just plain stupid.
