An attempt at humour, but one would have thought at least one of the
Websters could have prounced it correctly - I was hoping they would
ask that school teacher - private lessons! - could it be that Sally

I think that it is more likely to inflame Surfie's passions. She fancies
John Slitheen, and he knows that she fancies him. Having him in the house
can only lead to trouble.  I don't think that John Slitheen has thought this
one through properly.

Correk!

Not to mention that I do know how to pronounce &quot;quay&quot;, but whenever I

Also, boatswain is often written bosun, or even bo'sun, so one might

Presumably that was the original pronunciation.  &quot;Swain&quot; is an archaic term
for a young man or boy placed in a position of responsibility, originally as
servant to a knight. From that we get &quot;boatswain&quot;, meaning a man in charge
of the boat (or more accurately in charge of the deck crew) and &quot;coxswain&quot;
meaning a man in charge of the cox. The cox was a small pilot boat sent
ahead to plumb a passage through shallow waters. When in open water, the
coxswain was in charge of navigation.

As with many nautical terms, the pronunciation became corrupted over time,
to &quot;bosun&quot; and &quot;coxun&quot; respectively.

Yers, that was my point. Given that my father was in the Royal Navy,
