What's happenin', people? I just watched the Alabama-Florida State game.

And for the second week in a row, Bama loses in an exciting,
heartbreaking finish.

Florida State 21
Alabama 14

Now I'm gonna go eat some sort of brothy stew.

I watched the Mets win (a no-hitter into the 8th with 2 outs), then
the Phillies lose. Which means tomorrow is already penciled in.

Congrats, CapnBill, on the Sox. We'll meet again after the Yankees
dispatch the Indians and Boston the Angels.

My K-State Cats beat #7 Texas today 41 - 21 in Austin. I just got back
from welcoming them back at Manhattan Regional Airport and the Vanier
Football Complex.

If any of you need a loan or your car washed, this would be a good
time to ask.

Hey... quite a week coming up for LSDL... We have hypochondriac
extraordinaire Barry Sonnenfeld, Sean Penn, the always-scandalous
Sarah Silverman, mean daddy Alec Baldwin, the extensively easy-on-the-
eyes Faith Hill, the legendary Bob Newhart and Anton Fig on drums.

Catch the &quot;Late Show&quot; all this week on most of these same stations.

Emile Hirsch didn't even mention in his interview with Dave that Sean
Penn wrote and directed Into the Wild.  Sean Penn even hired Hirsch.
They were both on Oprah the other day and Sean Penn said it took him
10 years to secure the rights to the book so he could write the
screenplay.  The guy's mother kept having dreams that her son didn't
want a movie made about the film but then one night she had a dream
where he gave her the go ahead and she called Sean Penn and gave him
the rights to the movie.

Maybe...and Alec Baldwin should be fun too!

I listened to alot of the Met game on XM radio yesterday, annoys me that
I pay for the Extra Innings package and I couldnt watch one of the
biggest games all year. Looking forward to today. If there is a playoff
game tomorrow for the Mets and Phillies Im calling in sick. A nice
MLB/NFL doubleheader..

Ya know, David, I've decided that I might like to one day retire to a
college town. Naturally, Tuscaloosa is at the top of my list. But I've
been thinking that Manhattan, KS, should probably be a possibility as well.

I picture it being similar to Tuscaloosa.

Hope she had a great birthday.  You gave her a car, right?

Today is my youngest's 15th birthday.  We got him an electric guitar,
thus removing the possibility of peace and quiet for the next 4 years.

Unless I kick him out early.  Or they all band together and kick me out.
It could go either way.

My oldest turns 17 at the end of the month.
