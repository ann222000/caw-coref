Here's a fun one for you.  The present owner of my much-adored 93 RR
Classic TDi brought it down the lane yesterday saying &quot;We think it's
broken, but we don't know how&quot;.

The symptoms:  &quot;The steering started to go all snatchy and rough, and
then there was a hell of a bang and a thump, the engine cut out and
the hazard warning lights came on.  After a while we got the engine to
run again, but we couldn't turn the hazard lights off until we pulled
the clicking relay.  The engine then ran OK, and it actually drove
home very well -- much smoother than it's been for a while.&quot;

He then handed me something which gave me an immediate clue, but I'll
not tell you what it was until tomorrow.  In the meantime, any
workshop detectives want to start their deductions?

OK, clue coming... he handed me a broken Universal Joint Bearing Cap
and needle rollers that he'd found on his drive under where the RR
parks.

What had happened?

Worn/broken UJ, prop-shaft fell out from the front, RR ran over it as
the front dug into the road and lifted the vehicle, as it landed it
jarred the components that much the electrics 'frizzed' a little and
after settling down the vehicle was only in 2wd and so felt smoother to
drive as there was no out-of-balance- prop and UJ whizzing round, it
having been ripped off when it dug in.

Missus' Megane dropped off an engine mount and had very similar
electrical problems for a short while.  When the mount was replaced all
was fine.

Yup, spot on!  When I dived underneath, there was no propshaft to be
seen -- just the smashed yokes still attached to the axle and transfer
box.  It DOES explain the propshaft that was lying by the side of the
road about 2 miles from here, so I've been and retrieved it, but only
the splined end could be found.  The other end destroyed itself later?

There was also a clue in the title of the thread -- you can clearly
see where the end of the shaft dropped down and dug into the road,
smashing the transfer box yoke, but forcing the shaft up into the
floor, which has been pushed upwards by about half an inch.  There's
also what we in Yorkshire call a 'delve' in the chassis.

And the electrical hiccup?  Well, here I WOULD appreciate some help.
I suspected a possible inertia switch operated by the jolt, but
according to my wiring Electrical Troubleshooting Manual it's only the
petrol version that has that (to stop the high-pressure fuel injection
pump working after a crash).  The diesel doesn't seem to have such a
switch, but there always WERE little oddities in the wiring of this
car that seemed to be a bit 'intermediate' between the 93 and 94 model
years (it was officially a 94MO, but built in 93).  I can't locate the
position of such a switch, but in the V8 it was supposedly under the
front passenger seat, and would CERTAINLY have responded to that blow
to the floor.  WAS there such a switch in some models, akin to an
airbag switch, which would cut the engine and operate the hazard
lights?  There's no airbags to go off, of course, but maybe this was a
'crossover' model?

Like I said, the wifes Megane dropped an engine mount and we suffered
identical electrical gremlins for a while.  Mechanic reckoned that
places that aren't usually earthed might have been earthed and
'short-cuts' found that could cause random problems.  Certainly when
the rubber was replaced and the engine mount seated properly all the
electrical mproblems disappeared.

Maybe they gave the ecu an attack of the hiccups ... ;)

Had the prop shaft fall out at the rear over tarmac, very little harm done,
in fact still using the same propshaft.

Yeah but the front shaft, falling out from the front..  Have you never
seen the Sinbad movies, at least one nasty monster always dies by
being speared on a sharp stick wedged into the ground as it runs
forwards ;-)

Have been back to the spot this morning and managed to find the other
(short) part of the shaft by the roadside.  Unmistakable signs of a UJ
bearing having failed, causing the front end to seize and smash the
axle-end yoke, allowing the short end to drop free.  Then (as I said
before) the long end has dug into the road, causing the pole vault.
VERY lucky that it didn't have a much unhappier result.

MORAL:  Keep those UJs greased!
