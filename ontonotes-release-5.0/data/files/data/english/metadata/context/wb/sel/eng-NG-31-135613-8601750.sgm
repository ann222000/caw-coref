Hello all,

I have this problem with parsing XML which I hope someone can shed some
light on.
I'm downloading the XML with cfhttp, I then parse it, and it's fine, no
errors. Then I write it to the filesystem on another machine and when
opening in IE I get the following error;

The XML page cannot be displayed

Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet. Please correct the error and
then click the Refresh &lt;javascript:location.reload()&gt; button, or try again
later.
------------------------------

An invalid character was found in text content. Error processing resource
'file:///X:/Data/au_com_sellmystuff/xmlImport/441...

&lt;Site&gt;AU&lt;/Site&gt;&lt;Availability&gt;Yes&lt;/Availability&gt;&lt;Quantity&gt;13&lt;/Quantity&gt;&lt;Capt ion&gt;&lt;...

Following is the CF code that writes the file;
&lt;cffile
action=&quot;write&quot;
addnewline=&quot;no&quot;
file=&quot;#variables.filePath#&quot;
output=&quot;#trim( cfhttp.fileContent )#&quot;
fixnewline=&quot;no&quot;&gt;

Obviously something goes wrong in the process of saving the file to the
other server, but I can't figure out what? Anyone???

Try running the resulting output file through an XML validator to see if
the XML is in fact, valid?

I thought opening it up in Internet Explorer is enough proof its valid?
Happy to be proven wrong.

1. while the XML is on the remote server it displays fine in IE
2. when the XML is parsed on local server its fine
3. only when written to another server with cffile is it giving an error in
IE and when parsing.

That to me is saying there's something there that IE thinks is incorrect.

sounds like an encoding problem.

check that theres no UTF-8 BOM marker in the file - you might need a
good txt editor like notepad++ to do this.

check that the response content encoding from cfhttp and the cffile
encoding are the same (should be utf-8) check the &lt;?xml declaration
that the encoding there matches the encoding you use in your CFFILE
charset= attribute.

opening in IE proves it works with the MSXML parser. You might be
better off doing a dump of xmlPrase(cfhttp.fileContent) to get
hopefully more detailed exception info.

the other one is check for coldfusion debugging being turned off on
the remote server :) stupid i know, but i must admit ive made that
mistake!

man, I've been thru this grief, but it was like, over two years ago
(memory, where has thou gone?)

isXML() ... does it return true?

FormatXML() ... should be unnecessary but try it anyway.

if your XML was only half the size would it start working?
