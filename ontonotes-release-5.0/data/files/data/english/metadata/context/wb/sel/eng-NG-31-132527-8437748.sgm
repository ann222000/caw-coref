This is for &quot;Body of Lies&quot;
I attend the DC open call and it went smoothly.
They are also seeing non-SAG/AFTRA.
SAG/AFTRA folks get priority Â - I was in and out in about 15 mins. if that much.

*********************************************************
SAG/AFTRA Members!

Warner Bros. Pictures is seeking SAG members interested in being background
actors for a major motion picture filming in the DC and Baltimore areas
during the month of September.

If you are interested and did not attend the open call in DC held last
Saturday, please attend the open casting call:

WHEN: Saturday, August 25

WHERE: The Paradox Club

1310 Russell Street, Baltimore, MD 21230

(For directions visit www.thedox.com . Parking is available

TIME: Anytime between 10 am and 6 pm

Billy Dowd Casting looks forward to seeing you. Please bring a RECENT
picture and resume.

Casting Associates will be guiding SAG professionals through the line on a
priority basis.

SAG/AFTRA Members: Please note that Billy Dowd and his staff are from Los
Angeles, and as such, are not familiar with our talent pool. The Director
(Sir Ridley Scott) is also particular about the look of his background. It
is therefore even more important for you to attend the open call if you are
interested in being called for work! There was not a particularly impressive
turnout last Saturday so this is your chance to show Billy and Warner Bros.
the depth of our professional union talent pool.
