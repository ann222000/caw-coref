About the Book
Leading with Wisdom portrays an emerging global culture. This
path-breaking book offers the experiences and perspectives of 31 top
executives from 15 countries in 6 continents. They are executives who
express from their first hand experience what it is like to lead a
business from a spiritual basis. They tell amazing, down-to-earth,
real-life stories about how spirituality and rationality can go hand in
hand in leadership and life.

Their words of wisdom demonstrate that executives who lead from a
spiritual basis can achieve success, recognition, peace of mind and
happiness, while at the same time serving the needs of all those
affected by their leadership.

Written in an engaging style, where the special 'voice' of each leader
is heard, this book will be profoundly valuable to business leaders at
every level and for all those women and men who want to lead with
integrity from a spiritual basis.

REVIEWS
The most important thing [the core competence of business] is
righteousness, dharma. When there is righteousness in the heart, there
is beauty in the character. When there is beauty in the character, there
is harmony in the home. When there is harmony in the home, there is
order in the nation. When there is order in the nation, there is peace
in the world. The question before all of us today is, how do we get
righteousness in the heart?
A PJ Abdul Kalam, President of India, from the Epilogue

I think of spirituality as something that is beyond the body and mind.
It is something that gives a purpose and meaning to our existence. It is
something that gives you joy, happiness and contentment, which cannot be
gotten through material pursuits and knowledge.
N S Raghavan, Co-founder and former Joint Managing Director, Infosys

Leading with Wisdom is a fascinating attempt to capture the essence of
the timeless in the tapestry of our times. The authors bring together
very credible voices in corporate story telling. The book will take the
reader on a voyage of self-discovery in space and time. It may just as
well provide a fundamental shift in the way we look at the very puirpose
of business. This book is a trend setter and a refreshing contrast to
conventional success literature.
