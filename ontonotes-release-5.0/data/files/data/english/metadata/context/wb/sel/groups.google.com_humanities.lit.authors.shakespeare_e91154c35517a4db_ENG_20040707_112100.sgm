Divine Comedy Purgatorio: Canto III - Dante

Orribil furon li peccati miei;
ma la bonta infinita ha si gran braccia,
che prende cio che si rivolge a lei.
Se 'l pastor di Cosenza, che a la caccia
di me fu messo per Clemente allora,
avesse in Dio ben letta questa faccia,
l'ossa del corpo mio sarieno ancora
in co del ponte presso a Benevento,
sotto la guardia de la grave mora.
Or le bagna la pioggia e move il vento
di fuor dal regno, quasi lungo 'l *V E R D E*
dov' e' le trasmuto a lume spento.
Per lor maladizion si non si perde,
che non possa tornar, l'etterno amore,
mentre che la SPERANZA ha fior del *V E R D E*

(English translation by Henry W. Longfellow)

Horrible my iniquities had been;
But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,
That it receives whatever turns to it.
Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase
Of me was sent by Clement at that time,
In God read understandingly this page,
The bones of my dead body still would be
At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,
Under the *S A F E* guard of the heavy *C A I R N*.
Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,
Beyond the realm, almost beside the *V E R D E* ,
Where he transported them with TAPERS QUENCHED.
By malison of theirs is not so lost
Eternal Love, that it cannot return,
So long as HOPE has anything of *GREEN* .

&quot;Post Tenebras SPERO Lucem&quot; (After darkness I hope for light).
Pen name &quot;SPERANZA&quot;: Wilde's mother

&lt;&lt;The sixteenth of October, 1854, Oscar Wilde was born into a most
stimulating environment. The family, which included two year old brother
Wilkie (Willie became a journalist in London), lived on the North Side
of Merrion Square -- the right part of the right neighborhood for
members of those professions &quot;fit for gentlemen&quot; who aspired to the
aristocracy. His mother was a poet who wrote under the pen name
SPERANZA. SPERANZA held a weekly Salon in a candle-lit (on the sunniest
of afternoons) front room, which attracted the best and brightest of
Dublin's artists, writers, scientists, and miscellaneous intellectuals.
Oscar Wilde, at the youngest of ages, was encouraged by both parents to
sit among such visitors as, perhaps, John Ruskin-later an influential
teacher and friend at Oxford-and fetch books for his father, or amuse
adults with his stories.

Socially favored were those who could construct the most captivating
stories about illustrious history, and many stories wove superstition
into the formula. Wilde and his mother were very superstitious people,
and Wilde claimed to have been visited by both his mother and his wife
on the eve of their deaths, although on both occasions he was separated
by many miles (and, in the case of SPERANZA's death, which occurred when
Wilde was incarcerated, by formidable walls). This immersion in the
supernatural had an impact on Wilde's stories, particularly Dorian Gray
and &quot;Lord Arthur Saville's Crime,&quot; in which the protagonist is driven to
absurd distraction by the prediction of a white-knuckled fortune-teller.
He was also influenced in this stage by SPERANZA's memory of her uncle
Charles Maturin, an early author in the horror-fantasy genre-and a
source of great pride for the family -- and by Bram Stoker (author
of Dracula), who was a frequent guest at Merrion Square.

Irish superstition and myth not only set Wilde apart in England by
fueling excellent stories, but also by leaving its mark on his dress (he
always wore a scarab ring on each little finger), and in his actions (he
advised friends about avoiding the &quot;Evil Eye&quot;). This behavior must have
been-as Wilde is certain to have considered-incongruent with the English
social norm, and he probably considered it to be a prop at Oxford and
after. A prop which-like Lord Byron's pet bear and human skull
flagon-affirmed his social status (and catered to his elitism) since,
SPERANZA was convinced, eccentricity went hand in hand with genius. Thus
we read Wilde using displaying calculated eccentric individuality in
statements like &quot;Ambition is the last refuge failure&quot; and &quot;Faithfulness
is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the
intellect-simply a confession of failure,&quot; fully intending that such
statements should distinguish him as one whose brilliance gave him the
luxury to be complacent. Cultivation of mystique worked, and through a
combination of strange behavior, entertaining storytelling, and
effortless academic prowess-all of which attributes were somewhat
gained by his uniqueness as an Irishman steeped in domestic myth and
tradition-Wilde was a star before he had really published anything.

Unfortunately, popular acclaim made him too cocky, and he became
increasingly aboveboard about his interest in homosexuality
and Platonism. He met the charming but temperamental Lord
Alfred Douglas (&quot;Bosie&quot;), then an undergraduate at Oxford, and began a
very close relationship with him. This continued for years, causing
Wilde to neglect family and Douglas to forget his studies, until Bosie's
father, Lord Queensberry -- inventor of the boxing regulations and
apparently a bit of a lunatic -- began to stalk harass our hero in
search of evidence with which he could persecute him. In 1895 Wilde sued
him for libel after receiving an accusatory note, and Queensberry began
to turn London inside out in a search for evidence to support his claim.
A number of Wilde's passionate letters to Bosie were already
circulating, and were used with several of Wilde's own works-and a
list of male child prostitutes that he kept company with-to defeat the
poet. Why Wilde began a libel suit that he was bound to loose seems
inexplicable. One suggestion is that the idea of a glorious fight
against English justice was a remnant of his Irish upbringing with a
revolutionary mother (Jullian, p.316). Following this disaster, Wilde
was defeated on sodomy charges with the same evidence. After the trial,
he was given several opportunities to flee the country, but did not.
Probably this was due to the high esteem in which he held SPERANZA
who told him that if he remained, she should stand behind him, but
that if he left she would disown him. He remained in prison until 1898,
and the humiliation led him to produce De Profundis, which was an
Apologia in the form of a bitter letter to Bosie. He also drew from his
experience to produce &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; and several articles
against the poor conditions in British prisons, one of which contributed
to the passing of a law to prevent the imprisonment of children.

After Wilde's release he at last escaped to France, where he was
rejected by most of the people with whom he had consorted and who had
admired him in better days. Aubrey Beardsley, who had illustrated the
published version of Salome (and who was dying at an early age from
consumption), would cross streets to avoid him. Old mentors like
Mahaffy, if asked about Wilde, would murmur the brutal sentence, &quot;We no
longer speak of Wilde.&quot; Constance Wilde would send him an allowance,
but would not see him (which he did not mind) or allow him to visit his
children (which he did mind). A brief romantic reunion with Bosie cut
off that little amount of income also, and Wilde waited three years to
die. When death came, it came in a lonely Paris hotel room to a man
stripped of all arrogance and beauty-a man not too unlike the withered
cadaver that remains after the painting is violated in Dorian Gray.&gt;&gt;

The Red Cross Knight, 1793 by John Singleton Copley (1738-1815)

&lt;&lt;This idyllic scene illustrates an episode from Edmund Spenser's Faerie
Queene, published in 1590. The lengthy Elizabethan poem concerns
a Christian soldier's search for TRUTH. Early in his quest,
the knight encounters two lovely personifications of virtue:

FAITH, gowned in purest white and surrounded by a halo
of divine light, holds a chalice with a serpent she need not fear.

HOPE, garbed in heavenly BLUE,

carries a small ANCHOR that recalls the biblical
mention of HOPE &quot;as an ANCHOR of the soul.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;BLUE Fairy gives Pinocchio life. He is told that he can become a real
boy only after he has discovered bravery, TRUTH &amp; unselfishness.&gt;&gt;

Notes about The Red Cross Knight From Lynn Bruce

John Singleton Copley's painting, &quot;The Red Cross Knight&quot; is based on
Edmund Spenser's classic epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queen.&quot; This is a
symbolic painting about the most significant turning point in life, the
moment of seeing one's own sinfulness and turning away from a life
of sin to a life of faith -- some call it the new birth,
others regeneration and conversion.

A very distilled synopsis of the events leading up to
the moment depicted in this painting:

The Red Cross Knight had a true, chaste love in Una, daughter of the
King and Queen (who represent Adam and Eve; note that her name means
&quot;one,&quot; implying integrity). However, he was deceived and defiled by
Duessa (a demon witch with two faces, one beautiful, alluring and false,
the other hideous and real; note that her name implies duality), and
thus he lost both Una and his honor through deception and sin. He was
then redeemed by King Arthur (a Christ figure), and through his
providence, given the ability to see Duessa for what she is, and also
the strength to defeat and disrobe (disempower) her -
- thus the red robe draped over his arm.

So then, in this painting, we see the Red Cross Knight as he turns away
from Duessa (or, symbolically, from Evil) and in his path finds two of
three virgin sisters, Fidelia and Speranze (which mean Faith and Hope).
Fidelia (Faith) holds a cup of gold filled with wine and water (both
elements rich in Christian symbolism), from which coils the brass
serpent of Moses (representing healing). Heaven's light shines around
her head, and her countenance is constant. She holds the New Testament
in her hand. Speranze (Hope) leans on an ANCHOR on her arm, and looks
heavenward in constant prayer. Charissa (Love), the third virgin sister,
is absent because she has just given birth to a son.

In Spencer's poem, Fidelia (Faith) opens the Knight's eyes to heavenly
knowledge, whereupon he becomes so anguished over his sins that he
contemplates suicide. Speranze (Hope) steps in and comforts him, and
teaches him how to take hold of the assurance of the ANCHOR
she leans upon. He confesses his sins, and in the end he
and Una are married by the King himself.

Copley's children were the models for this painting. They can
be seen as young children in the Copley Family Portrait:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Edmund Spenser (1552-1599)
The Faerie Queene, Book 1, Canto 10

She was araied all in lilly white,
And in her right hand bore a cup of gold,
[W]ith wine and water fild up to the hight,
[I]n which a Serpent did himselfe enfold,
[T]hat horrour made to all, that did behold;
But she no whit did chaunge her constant mood:
And in her other hand she fast did hold
A booke, that was both signd and seald with blood,
Wherein darke things were writ, hard to be understood.

HER YOUNGER SISTER, THAT SPERANZA HIGHT,
WAS CLAD IN BLEW, that her beseemed well;
Not all so chearefull seemed she of sight,
As was her sister; whether dread did dwell,
Or anguish in her hart, is hard to tell:
Upon her arme a silver ANCHOR lay,
Whereon she leaned ever, as befell:
And ever up to heaven, as she did pray,

Her stedfast eyes were bent, ne swarved other way.
They seeing Una, towards her gan wend,
Who them encounters with like courtesie;
Many kind speeches they betwene them spend,
And greatly joy each other well to see:
Then to the knight with shamefast modestie

[T]hey turne themselves, at Unaes meeke request,
[A]nd him salute with well beseeming glee;
[W]ho faire them quites, as him beseemed best,
[A]nd goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest.
[T]hen Una thus; But she your sister deare,

The deare Charissa where is she become?
Or wants she health, or busie is elsewhere?
Ah no, said they, but forth she may not come:
For she of late is lightned of her wombe,
And hath encreast the world with one sonne more,
That her to see should be but troublesome.
Indeede (quoth she) that should her trouble sore,
But thankt be God, and her encrease so evermore.
Then said the aged Coelia, Deare dame,
And you good Sir, I wote that of your toyle,
And labours long, through which ye hither came,
Ye both forwearied be: therefore a whyle
I read you rest, and to your bowres recoyle.
Then called she a Groome, that forth him led
Into a goodly lodge, and gan despoile
Of puissant armes, and laid in easie bed;
His name was meeke Obedience rightfully ared.
Now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest,
And bodies were refresht with due repast,
Faire Una gan Fidelia faire request,
To have her knight into her schoolehouse plaste,
That of her heavenly learning he might taste,
And heare the wisedome of her words divine.
She graunted, and that knight so much agraste,
That she him taught celestiall discipline,
And opened his dull eyes, that light mote in them shine.
And that her sacred Booke, with bloud ywrit,
That none could read, except she did them teach,
She unto him disclosed every whit,
And heavenly documents thereout did preach,
That weaker wit of man could never reach,
Of God, of grace, of justice, of free will,
That wonder was to heare her goodly speach:
For she was able, with her words to kill,
And raise againe to life the hart, that she did thrill.
And when she list poure out her larger spright,
She would commaund the hastie Sunne to stay,
Or backward turne his course from heavens hight;
Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay;
Dry-shod to passe, she parts the flouds in tway;
And eke huge mountaines from their native seat
She would commaund, themselves to beare away,
And throw in raging sea with roaring threat.
Almightie God her gave such powre, and puissance great.
The faithfull knight now grew in litle space,
By hearing her, and by her sisters lore,
To such perfection of all heavenly grace,
That wretched world he gan for to abhore,
And mortall life gan loath, as thing forlore,
Greev'd with remembrance of his wicked wayes,
And prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore,

That he desirde to end his wretched dayes:
So much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes.
BUT WISE SPERANZA GAVE HIM COMFORT SWEET,
And taught him how to take assured hold
UPON HER SILVER ANCHOR, as was meet;
Else had his sinnes so great, and manifold

Made him forget all that Fidelia told.
In this distressed doubtfull agonie,
When him his dearest Una did behold,
Disdeining life, desiring leave to die,
She found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie.

ANCHORite: lives in seclusion usually for religious reasons

Late in the third century, Saint Anthony withdrew to the
mountains of Egypt to live in seclusion as a Christian ANCHORite

The title of a 13th-century manual for female recluses, the
_Ancrene Riwle_, or &quot;Rule of ANCHORS,&quot; shows that the
term &quot;ANCHOR&quot; was being used for religious hermits a full
450 years before &quot;ANCHORite&quot; came into common use in
our language. The reclusive &quot;anchor&quot; and &quot;ANCHORite&quot; are
both derived from the Middle Latin &quot;ANCHORita,&quot;

which, in turn, can be traced to the

Greek &quot;ANCHORein,&quot; meaning &quot;to withdraw.&quot;

&lt;&lt;As for the book-binder's whale winding like a vine-stalk round
the stock of a descending ANCHOR- as stamped and gilded on the
backs and titlepages of many books both old and new- that is a very
picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from
the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated
a DOLPHIN, I nevertheless call this book-binder's fish an attempt
at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first
introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere
about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those
days, and even down to a comparatively late period, DOLPHINS were
popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.&gt;&gt; - Moby Dick

Luke's Eutychus &amp; Homer's Elpenor:
Acts 20:7-12 Odyssey 10-12

By Dennis R. MacDonald Iliff School of Theology

&lt;&lt;L. Mestrius Plutarchus (c. 50-120 CE), Luke's contemporary, wrote two
stories about young men who visited the netherworld; the one most relevant
to Eutychus is that of Thespesius. This young man had squandered his youth
as a knave until he saw the punishments of the wicked in Hades for himself.

Like Homer's Elpenor, He had fallen from a height and broke his neck.

ON THE THIRD DAY, at the very time of his funeral, he revived.

Soon recovering his strength and senses, he instituted a change
in his way of life that could hardly be believed; for the Cilicians
know of no one in those times more honest in his engagements, more
pious toward heaven, or more grievous to his enemies and faithful to
his friends; so that all who met him longed to hear the reason for the
difference, supposing nothing ordinary could have caused so great a
reformation in character. Such indeed was the case, as appears from
the story as told by himself to Protogenes and other worthy friends.

He said that when his intelligence was driven from his body,
the change made him feel as a pilot might at first on being
flung into the depths of the sea. (Divine Vengeance 563d-e)

With respect to his fatal fall, the youth imitates Elpenor, but in his visit
to the netherworld, he is more like Plato's Er. Plutarch narrates at some
length what the youth had seen in Hades, the fates of righteous and wicked
souls (565a-b). Thespesius, too, learned that he had not died; rather,
&quot;through a divine dispensation [you] are present here in your intelligence,
having left the rest of your soul (psuchên), LIKE AN ANCHOR, behind in
your body&quot; (564c). He also learned, as Odysseus had from Tiresias,
the circumstances of his own death. Odysseus saw his mother emerge
from Hades to drink the blood from the trench; Thespesius &quot;caught
sight of his own father emerging from a pit, covered with brands
and scars, stretching out his arms to him&quot; (566f).&gt;&gt;

Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug,
I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile

intended to represent an ANCHOR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
For an extra level of realism: bury your paper Globe
under a paper model of a late GEORGIAN building:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 5% or so of the Globe that a Museum of London team of archaeologists
uncovered in 1989 from the open space behind ANCHOR Terrace
in Southwark was a segment on the north-east flank of the auditorium.
Analysis of this fragment made it clear that the most significant &amp; valuable
foundations, the stage area, must be underneath ANCHOR Terrace itself.

A tentative dig was done in the Terrace's cellarage in 1992,
and established that the remains are there.

Now, it seems, the opportunity to learn ANYTHING
from them is to be buried PERMANENTLY.

At a meeting on 7 January, Southwark Borough Council's Planning
Committee affirmed English Heritage's policy by granting permission
to the owners of ANCHOR Terrace, which is a scheduled late GEORGIAN
block built in 1839 facing Southwark Bridge Road, to convert
the building into flats, and to return the Globe's remains
&quot;to the burial regime which has protected them in the past&quot;.

Without consultation, least of all with the scholars and theatre
historians who could have told them how important the site is,
nor taking any account of the high level of public interest, English
Heritage has concluded that &quot;further archaeological investigation
with the basement of ANCHOR Terrace is not justified at present&quot;.

SCENE IV. Plains wear TEWKSBURY Flourish. March.
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET,

OXFORD, and SOLDIERS

QUEEN MARGARET Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-ANCHOR lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the HELM and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our ANCHOR; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not OXFORD here another ANCHOR?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the HELM to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?

REID'S GRAVE in KENSAL GREEN CEMETERY, LONDON, ENGLAND

Mayne REID's tombstone is one of the most unusual ever made.

Placed here by his wife, Elizabeth,
it features an ANCHOR, a sword,

and a quotation from The Scalphunters:

&quot;This is the Weed Prairie.
It is misnamed;
it is the GARDEN of God.&quot;

_Portrait of the Artist_ - Joyce

He passed out of the schoolhouse and HALTed under the shed that flanked
the GARDEN. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the
audience and sudden BRAZEN clashes of the soldiers' band. The light
spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive
ark, ANCHORed among the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns
looping her to her moorings. A side door of the theatre opened suddenly
and a shaft of light flew across the grass plots. A sudden burst of
music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the side
door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music.

Ulysses - Joyce

580.46: Outdoor: GARDEN and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised
causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh
water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle
with kedge ANCHOR on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of
estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession
with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable
cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor:
discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal
problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house
carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws,
tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.

&lt;&lt;During his lifetime (1818-1883) Capt. Mayne REID was
one of the most prolific and widely-read authors of adventure
novels and juvenile books in the world. His books, most of which
were set in the American &quot;Wild West,&quot; were favored by many future
leaders, including Theodore Roosevelt and Lord Baden-Powell.&gt;&gt;

Norse: (REID = ROSS)
Phonetic value: R
Anglo - Saxon: Rad
Germanic name: RAIDo
Traditional meaning: Riding

&lt;&lt;This rune is a symbol of a journey on HORSEback, which in turn is
an image for a ride into the underworld. It is a universal technique for
shamans entering to world of the dead to ride on an animal. Odin rode
Sleipnir, his eight-legged HORSE - which can be likened to four men
carrying a coffin. The rune is used in invoking the dead and is also
linked with the chariot god, THOR. The rune is a symbol of change
in the self, new ideas, new ways of life. In all religions death
is a symbol of coming renewal. Similar to the Death Tarot card.&gt;&gt;

ANACREON'S GRAVE. - Goethe

HERE where the roses blossom,
where vines round the laurels are twining,
Where the turtle-dove calls, where the blithe cricket is heard,
Say, whose GRAVE can this be, with life by all the Immortals
Beauteously planted and deck'd?--Here doth ANACREON sleep
Spring and summer and autumn rejoiced the thrice-happy minstrel,
And from the winter this mound kindly hath screen'd him at last.

&lt;&lt;'Oh - &quot;ORANGEs &amp; lemons, say the bells of St Clement's.&quot; That was
a rhyme we had when I was a little boy.How it goes on I don't remember,
but I do know it ended up, &quot;Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
Here comes a chopper to chop off your head.&quot; It was a kind of a dance.
They held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to
&quot;Here comes a chopper to chop off your head&quot; they brought their arms
down and caught you. It was just names of churches. All the London
churches were in it - all the principal ones, that is.'&gt;&gt; - 1984

&lt;&lt;Immediately opposite is St Mary-le-Strand Church (with its twin St.
Clement Danes to your right). St Mary is a neat Baroque style building
dating from 1711 - Charles DICKENS' parents were married here in 1809.
St. Clements is reputed to date back to the Danish occupation in the
10th century - parts of the original church still exist. It then became a
Templar Church - after they were suppressed it came under the Bishop
of Exeter, who lived in the Strand. Today's building is by Wren, who
repaired the building that had escaped the Great Fire, but lapsed into
decay . Samuel Johnson worshipped here and a plaque marks his seat.
Buried here is the boy whose cheating move at football gave rise to
Rugby. The Church's claim to be behind the rhyme 'ORANGEs &amp; Lemons'
is false but Orwell (who worked at the BBC which has its foreign language
service nearby) evidently believed it and used the conceit in '1984'.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Richard Field had printed in 1593 the _Sermons_ of Henry Smith -
Nashe's superb &quot;silver-tongued Smith&quot; - whose preaching at
St. CLEMENT DANES in the Strand includes pungent images
which often remind one of [Macbeth]:

'You are not like hearers, but like CIPHERS,
which supply a place but signify nothing;'

'As if we were night-black ravens, which cannot be
washed clean with all the soap of the Gospel;'

'All his lights are put out at once'

and straight he giveth place to another'&gt;&gt;

Tickle me ELMO
------------------------------------------------------------
ERASMUS of Formiae BM (a.k.a. ELMO, Erarmo, Ermo)

&lt;&lt;According to his legend, it is said that when the persecutions of
Diocletian began, ELMO fled to Mount Lebanon and lived alone on what
RAVENS brought him to eat. Captured by his enemies, he was brought
before Diocletian and beaten with clubs weighted with lead &amp; whips.
When it was perceived that he was still alive, the saint was rolled in
tar and set alight; but still he survived. Thrown into prison with the
intention of letting him die of starvation, ERASMUS managed to escape.
He was recaptured in the Roman province of Illyricum, after boldly
preaching &amp; converting numerous pagans to Christianity. This time his
tortures included being forced to sit in a heated iron chair. Finally,
according to this version of the legend, he was killed when his stomach
was cut open and his intestine wound around a windlass. This late legend
of his intestines being drawn out and wound around a windlass may have
developed from his emblem of a windlass (signifying his patronage of
sailors who use the windlass to wind up the ANCHOR of their ships) being
confused with an instrument of torture. ELMO may have become the patron
of sailors because he is said to have continued to preach even after a
thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who
were in danger from sudden storms and lightning to claim his prayers.
The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as
a sign of his protection and came to be called &quot;Saint ELMO's Fire.&quot;

Thomas VAVASOUR

&lt;&lt; English Catholic physician, pensioner of St. John's College,
Cambridge, b. about 1536-7; d. at Hull, 2 May, 1585. On 25 June, 1549,
at the disputations held before the king's commissioners at Cambridge,
VAVASOUR was one of the disputants in favour of Transubstantiation and
the Sacrifice of the Mass. He subsequently went to Venice where he took
the degree of M.D., and on 20 Nov., 1556, he received a licence from the
College of Physicians of London to practise for two years. His house was
&quot;by the common school house&quot; in the city of YORK; there Mass was said in
1570. In 1572 he was accused of having entertained Blessed Edmund
Campion. In Nov., 1574, after he had been confined to his own house in
the city of YORK for nearly nine months, he was sent into solitary
confinement in the Hull Castle. Grindal describes him as &quot;sophistical,
disdainful, and illuding arguments with irrision, when he was not able
to solute the same by learning&quot;, and adds that &quot;his great anchor-hold
was in urging the literal sense of hoc est corpus meum, thereby to prove
transubstantiation&quot;. By June, 1579, he was back again in his house,
where Mass was again said. Later on he was in the Gatehouse,
Westminster, from which he was released on submitting to acknowledge
the royal supremacy in religious matter; but he was again imprisoned
as a recusant in Hull Castle, YORK where he died.&gt;&gt;
