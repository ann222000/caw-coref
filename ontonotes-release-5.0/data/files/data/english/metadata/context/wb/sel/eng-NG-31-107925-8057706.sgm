How the hell does anyone take this guy seriously?  He is in his own
world, thinking he won the Busch race today.  I hope NASCAR suspends
him from ALL competition for a weekend.

Up until now, I actually felt sorry for Robby, being a one car team
owner/driver and all, and with all his struggles to make races last
year, and all his troubles with NASCAR over the years.  Not any more!
He's almost as big a bonehead as the guy who was declared the
winner.

Some people do just not want to go along to get along.  Some people just
march to the beat of the drummer inside them.

Robbie Gordon brings more color to NASCAR than a dozen Jimmie Johnsons ever
would.

Or it could just be that poor old Robbie was dropped on his head as a child
which would explain his basic hatred of people.

If you ever seed this old movie called &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; or something like
that it may recall you of Robbie Gordon and his James Dean iconoclast
stance.

Watching someone make a complete fool of themselves does add 'color'
I guess but I'm not sure it's a very attractive color. An offensive
odor might also go along with that certain color.

What has happened to the integrity of our society when we think
someone being a jerk is refreshing and just that person being real.
Whatever happened to being a good person, a good sport, and role
model for our youth. (shakes head)

Next time someone doesn't want to get in line:  1. Throw a red flag.
2.  When Robby stops, pull his hood pins and remove his distributor.
3. Road course, local yellow for the rest of the race--Oval, call a
wrecker.

Yup and that was unfair to Harvick who deserved to celebrate his win
without sharing the spotlight. I think Robby Gordon gets it into his
big head he is supposed to win the road courses and then tries to
force every issue and bully his way to the front, forgetting all
about patience and common sense. And, when things don't work out
because he used up his car or got wrecked, he gets mad and blames
everyone else including NASCAR. I think he has been successful in
off-road racing because you don't have to deal with the other
drivers as much. I don't think he will ever win a oval race in
NASCAR because he lacks the skill, finesse, and strategy needed to
get it done without wrecking half the field. It's really a shame too
because I think he does have the talent.

I definitely agree. If wants to make a fool of himself, let him have
the embarrassment of having his car disabled and parked in that way.

&gt; Nice post.  There used to be &quot;good guys&quot;.  I think they're still around.

Frankly this time the good guy might have been Robby.  When you talk
of integrity you have to also call into question Nascar's integrity.
Robby raced Ambrose clean.  He made a clean pass.  Maybe Ambrose
didn't see the yellow.  If Robby lifted when the yellow was out that
is exactly what he is should do under the current rules.  If Ambrose
didn't see they yellow, why not.  Robby did.  If he did and didn't
lift as he should have, he finished higher than he should have.  No I
don't think he wrecked Robby intentionally.  Yet he is a younger
driver that may be in over his head, and then again it could have been
one of those racin deals.

Nascar is under a legal obligation to treat all teams equally as a
part of conducting a race.  There have been times in the past where
the right thing was done.  When situations like that have occurred in
the past, the position was given back.  When the yellow came out the
field was frozen and he was either first or second depending on when
you consider it to have come out.  Fact he gave up positions only
because he was wrecked due to no fault of his own and was able to
maintain pace after the field cleared.  He could have maintained the
pace so to speak, and not lost so many positions, but caused another
wreck.

Up until this point, NASCAR was totally in the wrong.  I don't blame
Robby for not going back so far.  I don't blame him for starting in
the second spot in that if he were going to appeal, moving back would
make it a moot point.  For it to have any meaning he had to cross the
line first, which he did.  Though I don't condone him punting Ambrose,
I can understand why he did it.  He knew an appeal was going to have
little chance of being successful.  He also knew that if he passed him
clean that the punter was going to be rewarded with a win they didn't
deserve.

Was he wrong?  Well thats for each to decide for themselves, but I
sure understand why he did it.  Yet I don't buy the role model
argument in any situation on TV.  The real role model is the parent.
If you don't want your kid to behave like Robby did, sit down and
explain to him why you don't.  If you see someone that you do want to
use as an example of how you want your child to behave, sit down and
explain that to them too.   Both provide excellent teaching
opportunities, but only the real role models can do that and that's
the parents.  Any kid learning right from wrong from TV alone is in
deep trouble no matter what you put on TV.

It will be interesting to see how hard Nascar comes down on Robby.  I
heard he tried to get into victory lane.  Notice as soon as he punted
Ambrose, Espn refused to put the car on air, which told me Nascar had
already called.  I am not so sure that at 1 mph no matter who was
telling me not to, if I were in that situation, I might be in victory
lane and the TV show would have to be moved.

Robby may be in an interesting position.  He is in his mid 40s.  The
business of Nascar is going to phase his teams out soon anyway.  His
driving days are numbered by age.  If they came down too hard on me, I
would be very tempted to retire from Cup racing an take it to court
with damages so high it would make their head swim.  Win or not, every
entertainment yellow could be called into question and the PR hit to
Nascar would be devastating.  Robby may not do it, but sooner or later
someone will.  Race finishes have been decided in court before.  Just
ask Mario Andretti and Bobby Unser.

If Gordon wanted to make his point he could have stayed in 2nd place
and raced cleanly to the finish. He was bangin into Ambrose the whole
time under caution laps. It appeared he was fuming at Ambrose as much
as any body. But he didnt choose to race cleanly, he chose to behave
like a dickhead.

Also judging from the back of Ambose's car, Gordon pushed him out of
the way to take the lead any way.

Everything points to Gordon behaving like a fool.

In Australia he'd be known as a wanker.

I'm certain you're correct in that.  Unfortunately, Gordon doesn't
have the judgement capability to determine whether he was &quot;screwed&quot;,
so he reaches an inappropriate conclusion and the upshot is that he
acted like a jerk.

A good guy wouldn't spin out the leader while he was already black
flagged.  He broke numerous rules and any penalties &quot;detrimental to
NASCAR&quot; will be because of that.  It isn't the first time a bad call
happened in NASCAR and it won't be the last.

&gt;the right thing was done.  When situations like that have occurred in
&gt;the past, the position was given back.  When the yellow came out the
&gt;field was frozen and he was either first or second depending on when
&gt;you consider it to have come out.  Fact he gave up positions only
&gt;because he was wrecked due to no fault of his own and was able to
&gt;maintain pace after the field cleared.  He could have maintained the
&gt;pace so to speak, and not lost so many positions, but caused another
&gt;wreck.

&gt;Up until this point, NASCAR was totally in the wrong.  I don't blame
&gt;Robby for not going back so far.  I don't blame him for starting in
&gt;the second spot in that if he were going to appeal, moving back would
&gt;make it a moot point.  For it to have any meaning he had to cross the
&gt;line first, which he did.  Though I don't condone him punting Ambrose,
&gt;I can understand why he did it.  He knew an appeal was going to have
&gt;little chance of being successful.  He also knew that if he passed him
&gt;clean that the punter was going to be rewarded with a win they didn't
&gt;deserve.

&gt;Was he wrong?  Well thats for each to decide for themselves, but I
&gt;sure understand why he did it.  Yet I don't buy the role model
&gt;argument in any situation on TV.  The real role model is the parent.
&gt;If you don't want your kid to behave like Robby did, sit down and
&gt;explain to him why you don't.  If you see someone that you do want to
&gt;use as an example of how you want your child to behave, sit down and
&gt;explain that to them too.   Both provide excellent teaching
&gt;opportunities, but only the real role models can do that and that's
&gt;the parents.  Any kid learning right from wrong from TV alone is in
&gt;deep trouble no matter what you put on TV.

&gt;It will be interesting to see how hard Nascar comes down on Robby.  I
&gt;heard he tried to get into victory lane.  Notice as soon as he punted
&gt;Ambrose, Espn refused to put the car on air, which told me Nascar had
&gt;already called.  I am not so sure that at 1 mph no matter who was
&gt;telling me not to, if I were in that situation, I might be in victory
&gt;lane and the TV show would have to be moved.

&gt;Robby may be in an interesting position.  He is in his mid 40s.  The
&gt;business of Nascar is going to phase his teams out soon anyway.  His
&gt;driving days are numbered by age.  If they came down too hard on me, I
&gt;would be very tempted to retire from Cup racing an take it to court
&gt;with damages so high it would make their head swim.  Win or not, every
&gt;entertainment yellow could be called into question and the PR hit to
&gt;Nascar would be devastating.  Robby may not do it, but sooner or later
&gt;someone will.  Race finishes have been decided in court before.  Just
&gt;ask Mario Andretti and Bobby Unser.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What has happened to the integrity of our society when we think
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; someone being a jerk is refreshing and just that person being real.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever happened to being a good person, a good sport, and role
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; model for our youth. (shakes head)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Nice post.  There used to be &quot;good guys&quot;.  I think they're still around.

&gt;&gt; Frankly this time the good guy might have been Robby.  When you talk
&gt;&gt; of integrity you have to also call into question Nascar's integrity.
&gt;&gt; Robby raced Ambrose clean.  He made a clean pass.  Maybe Ambrose
&gt;&gt; didn't see the yellow.  If Robby lifted when the yellow was out that
&gt;&gt; is exactly what he is should do under the current rules.  If Ambrose
&gt;&gt; didn't see they yellow, why not.  Robby did.  If he did and didn't
&gt;&gt; lift as he should have, he finished higher than he should have.  No I
&gt;&gt; don't think he wrecked Robby intentionally.  Yet he is a younger
&gt;&gt; driver that may be in over his head, and then again it could have been
&gt;&gt; one of those racin deals.

&gt;&gt; Nascar is under a legal obligation to treat all teams equally as a
&gt;&gt; part of conducting a race.  There have been times in the past where
&gt;&gt; the right thing was done.  When situations like that have occurred in

&gt;If Gordon wanted to make his point he could have stayed in 2nd place
&gt;and raced cleanly to the finish. He was bangin into Ambrose the whole
&gt;time under caution laps. It appeared he was fuming at Ambrose as much
&gt;as any body. But he didnt choose to race cleanly, he chose to behave
&gt;like a dickhead.

&gt;Also judging from the back of Ambose's car, Gordon pushed him out of
&gt;the way to take the lead any way.

excellent point.  I kept waiting for the cameras to pick it up, but
right before the pass, there was no damage to Ambrose's car.

Nice debut for NASCAR, lol

No, this was great.  It's about time someone with more than just sponsor
laden platitudes on his mind, stood his ground against the increasingly
arbitrary nature of NASCAR's calls.  NASCAR blew it big time, and their very
motive is in question with race calls these days.  Hats off to Robby for
having guts enough to stand up for what was right, despite knowing what the
consequences would be.

Alan - I have to agree that Robby's actions were over the line.  At least
they would be over the line for a normal racing environment.  That said, I'm
applauding Robby's actions this weekend since NASCAR has pushed this stuff
too far, with their arbitrary calls, and twisted interpretations of their
rules.  They have created an environment where it's about time someone stood
up and raised a little hell.  Sure - Robby will pay for it, but he also
raised fan's attention level to some of this stuff and fans are already
speaking out (even polls on NASCAR.com) in favor of Robby.  Fans are getting
tired of NASCAR's contrived ways.  Good for Robby to have raised that level
of awareness within the fan base.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm certain you're correct in that.  Unfortunately, Gordon doesn't

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so he reaches an inappropriate conclusion and the upshot is that he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acted like a jerk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know him well-enough to make that judgment?

&gt;&gt; Having watched him for some considerable number of years now,
&gt;&gt; I think it's an opinion that can be supported with the evidence.

&gt;&gt; John

&gt; So you don't really know him well-enough to make the judgment.  Maybe if
&gt; you knew him, it might be different?

This proves how little you know about NASCAR. John was being gentle by
only calling him a &quot;jerk.&quot; Regardless of what kind of person RG is away
from racing, his amazingly long record of acting &amp; driving like a complete
asinine fool on the track speaks for itself. He's been called Menace,
Moron, etc. publicly many times by more than one of his fellow
competitors, and if you'd been watching NASCAR at all these last 5 years
(at least) you would realize everyone knows well enough that he's an
idiot. [Although to be fair, I don't completely blame him in this
situation. But being Robby, he just took it -way- too far.]

I think Robby is showing some - grown-up-i-ness, at the least -
Ambrose is driving for him at Watkins Glen in the 77 car.  Good for
both Robby and Marcus -

Ambrose is better looking and has that kewl Aussie accent, so I guess
I'm a 77 fan this week.  LOL.

Doesn't matter if Gordon passed under the yellow, it would have
