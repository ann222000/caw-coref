Gabriel Harvey and the Genesis of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;
by Andrew Hannas

&lt;&lt;Harvey's epithet for Cecil, &quot;Polus&quot;,
sounded half a dozen times in his 1578 toast to Cecil, literally
of course referring to the central pole or axis on which the earth
turns, but for an ear tuned to the Greek of Plato also the name
of the blustering, sycophantic protege of the sophist Gorgias,
whom Socrates mocks in the Gorgias much the way Hamlet does
Polonius (literally &quot;colt&quot; in Greek, polos,
punned on polios, &quot;gray&quot;, also befitting Cecil).&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plato's _Gorgias_ (Sparknotes Summary)

The conversation moves on to explore the nature of power, with eager
young POLUS taking the reigns from his master Gorgias. POLUS initially
declares power to be something good for its possessor, a claim that
exists as equivalent to the one that power is the ability of its
possessor to achieve the end of the good through their actions. Socrates
jumps to . . . consideration of a powerful tyrant. As he frames the
issue, a strong leader often faces situations (for example) in which
someone must be punished or even executed for the good of the state. In
such an instance, the ruler does what he believes to be good, thereby
bracketing the action within the realm of POLUS's definition of power as
good for its possessor. Socrates furthermore claims that in this type of
situation, the ruler does not will the action of punishment or
execution, but instead wills its outcome of benefit to the state.
Authoritative tyrants are therefore shown nonetheless not to possess
TRUE power, since they still must perform actions they do not
voluntarily will.

_GORGIAS_ by Plato (370 BC)
translated by Benjamin Jowett

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Callicles; Socrates; Chaerephon; Gorgias; Polus

Soc. will you ask him, Chaerephon-?

Chaer. What shall I ask him?

Soc. Ask him who he is.

Chaer. What do you mean?

Soc. I mean such a question as would elicit from him, if he had been a
maker of shoes, the answer that he is a cobbler. Do you understand?

Chaer. I understand, and will ask him: Tell me, Gorgias, is our friend
Callicles right in saying that you undertake to answer any questions
which you are asked?

Gorgias. Quite right, Chaerephon: I was saying as much only just now;
and I may add, that many years have elapsed since any one has asked me a
new one.

Chaer. Then you must be VERy ready, Gorgias.

Gor. Of that, Chaerephon, you can make trial.

Polus. Yes, indeed, and if you like, Chaerephon,
you may make trial of me too, for I think that Gorgias,
who has been talking a long time, is tired.

Chaer. And do you, Polus, think that you can answer better than Gorgias?

Pol. What does that matter if I answer well enough for you?

Chaer. Not at all:-and you shall answer if you like.

Pol. Ask:-

Chaer. My question is this: If Gorgias had the skill of his brother
Herodicus, what ought we to call him? Ought he not to have the name
which is given to his brother?

Pol. Certainly.

Chaer. Then we should be right in calling him a physician?

Pol. Yes.

Chaer. And if he had the skill of Aristophon the son of Aglaophon, or of
his brother Polygnotus, what ought we to call him?

Pol. Clearly, a painter.

Chaer. But now what shall we call him-what is the art in which he is
skilled.

Pol. O Chaerephon, there are many arts among mankind which are
experimental, and have their origin in experience, for experience makes
the days of men to proceed according to art, and inexperience according
to chance, and different persons in different ways are proficient in
different arts, and the best persons in the best arts. And our friend
Gorgias is one of the best, and the art in which he is a proficient is
the noblest.

Soc. Polus has been taught how to make a capital speech, Gorgias; but he
is not fulfilling the promise which he made to Chaerephon.

Gor. What do you mean, Socrates?

Soc. I mean that he has not exactly answered the question which he was
asked.

Gor. Then why not ask him yourself?

Soc. But I would much rather ask you, if you are disposed to answer: for
I see, from the few words which Polus has uttered, that he has attended
more to the art which is called rhetoric than to dialectic.

Pol. What makes you say so, Socrates?

Soc. Because, Polus, when Chaerephon asked you what was the art which
Gorgias knows, you praised it as if you were answering some one who
found fault with it, but you nEVER said what the art was.

Pol. Why, did I not say that it was the noblest of arts?

Soc. Yes, indeed, but that was no answer to the question: nobody asked
what was the quality, but what was the nature, of the art, and by what
name we were to describe Gorgias.
----------------------------------------------
Soc. I was thinking at the time, when I heard you saying so, that
rhetoric, which is always discoursing about justice, could not possibly
be an unjust thing. But when you added, shortly afterwards, that the
rhetorician might make a bad use of rhetoric I noted with surprise the
inconsistency into which you had fallen; and I said, that if you
thought, as I did, that there was a gain in being refuted, there would
be an advantage in going on with the question, but if not, I would leave
off. And in the course of our investigations, as you will see yourself,
the rhetorician has been acknowledged to be incapable of making an
unjust use of rhetoric, or of willingness to do injustice. By the dog,
Gorgias, there will be a great deal of discussion, before we get at the
TRUTH of all this.

Polus. And do even you, Socrates, seriously believe what you are now
saying about rhetoric? What! because Gorgias was ashamed to deny that
the rhetorician knew the just and the honourable and the good, and
admitted that to any one who came to him ignorant of them he could teach
them, and then out of this admission there arose a contradiction-the
thing which you dearly love, and to which not he, but you, brought the
argument by your captious questions-[do you seriously believe that there
is any TRUTH in all this?] For will any one EVER acknowledge that he
does not know, or cannot teach, the nature of justice? The TRUTH is,
that there is great want of manners in bringing the argument to such a
pass.

Soc. Illustrious Polus, the reason why we provide ourselves with friends
and children is, that when we get old and stumble, a younger generation
may be at hand to set us on our legs again in our words and in our
actions: and now, if I and Gorgias are stumbling, here are you who
should raise us up; and I for my part engage to retract any error into
which you may think that I have fallen-upon one condition:

Pol. What condition?

Soc. That you contract, Polus, the prolixity of speech in which you
indulged at first.

Pol. What! do you mean that I may not use as many words as I please?

Soc. Only to think, my friend, that having come on a visit to Athens,
which is the most free-spoken state in Hellas, you when you got there,
and you alone, should be deprived of the power of speech-that would be
hard indeed. But then consider my case:-shall not I be VERy hardly used,
if, when you are making a long oration, and refusing to answer what you
are asked, I am compelled to stay and listen to you, and may not go
away? I say rather, if you have a real interest in the argument, or, to
repeat my former expression, have any desire to set it on its legs, take
back any statement which you please; and in your turn ask and answer,
like myself and Gorgias-refute and be refuted: for I suppose that you
would claim to know what Gorgias knows-would you not?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And you, like him, invite any one to ask you about anything which
he pleases, and you will know how to answer him?

Pol. To be sure.

Soc. And now, which will you do, ask or answer?

Pol. I will ask; and do you answer me, Socrates, the same question which
Gorgias, as you suppose, is unable to answer: What is rhetoric?

Soc. Do you mean what sort of an art?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. To say the TRUTH, Polus, it is not an art at all, in my opinion.

Pol. Then what, in your opinion, is rhetoric?

Soc. A thing which, as I was lately reading in a book of yours, you say
that you have made an art.

Pol. What thing?

Soc. I should say a sort of experience.

Pol. Does rhetoric seem to you to be an experience?

Soc. That is my view, but you may be of another mind.

Pol. An experience in what?

Soc. An experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification.

Pol. And if able to gratify others, must not rhetoric be a fine thing?

Soc. What are you saying, Polus? Why do you ask me whether rhetoric is a
fine thing or not, when I have not as yet told you what rhetoric is?

Pol. Did I not hear you say that rhetoric was a sort of experience?

Soc. Will you, who are so desirous to gratify others, afford a slight
gratification to me?

Pol. I will.

Soc. Will you ask me, what sort of an art is cookery?

Pol. What sort of an art is cookery?

Soc. Not an art at all, Polus.

Pol. What then?

Soc. I should say an experience.

Pol. In what? I wish that you would explain to me.

Soc. An experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification,
Polus.

Pol. Then are cookery and rhetoric the same?

Soc. No, they are only different parts of the same profession.

Pol. Of what profession?

Soc. I am afraid that the TRUTH may seem discourteous; and I hesitate to
answer, lest Gorgias should imagine that I am making fun of his own
profession. For whether or no this is that art of rhetoric which Gorgias
practises I really cannot tell:-from what he was just now saying,
nothing appeared of what he thought of his art, but the rhetoric which I
mean is a part of a not VERy creditable whole.

Gor. A part of what, Socrates? Say what you mean, and nEVER mind me.

Soc. In my opinion then, Gorgias, the whole of which rhetoric is a part
is not an art at all, but the habit of a bold and ready wit, which knows
how to manage mankind: this habit I sum up under the word &quot;flattery&quot;;
and it appears to me to have many other parts, one of which is cookery,
which may seem to be an art, but, as I maintain, is only an experience
or routine and not an art:-another part is rhetoric, and the art of
attiring and sophistry are two others: thus there are four branches, and
four different things answering to them. And Polus may ask, if he likes,
for he has not as yet been informed, what part of flattery is rhetoric:
he did not see that I had not yet answered him when he proceeded to ask
a further question: Whether I do not think rhetoric a fine thing? But I
shall not tell him whether rhetoric is a fine thing or not, until I have
first answered, &quot;What is rhetoric?&quot; For that would not be right, Polus;
but I shall be happy to answer, if you will ask me, What part of
flattery is rhetoric?

Pol. I will ask and do you answer? What part of flattery is rhetoric?

Soc. Will you understand my answer? Rhetoric, according to my view, is
the ghost or counterfeit of a part of politics.

Pol. And noble or ignoble?

Soc. Ignoble, I should say, if I am compelled to answer, for I call what
is bad ignoble: though I doubt whether you understand what I was saying
before.

---------------------------------------------------
Pol. do you think that rhetoric is flattery?

Soc. Nay, I said a part of flattery-if at your age, Polus, you cannot
remember, what will you do by-and-by, when you get older?

Pol. And are the good rhetoricians meanly regarded in states,
under the idea that they are flatterers?

Soc. Is that a question or the beginning of a speech?

Pol. I am asking a question.

Soc. Then my answer is, that they are not regarded at all.

Pol. How not regarded? Have they not VERy great power in states?

Soc. Not if you mean to say that power is a good to the possessor.

Pol. And that is what I do mean to say.

Soc. Then, if so, I think that they have the least power
of all the citizens.

Pol. What! Are they not like tyrants? They kill and despoil
and exile any one whom they please.

Soc. By the dog, Polus, I cannot make out at each DEliVERance
of yours, whether you are giving an opinion of your own,
or asking a question of me.

Pol. I am asking a question of you.

Soc. Yes, my friend, but you ask two questions at once.

Pol. How two questions?

Soc. Why, did you not say just now that the rhetoricians are like
tyrants, and that they kill and despoil or exile any one whom they
please?

Pol. I did.

Soc. Well then, I say to you that here are two questions in one, and I
will answer both of them. And I tell you, Polus, that rhetoricians and
tyrants have the least possible power in states, as I was just now
saying; for they do literally nothing which they will, but only what
they think best.

Pol. And is not that a great power?

Soc. Polus has already said the rEVERse.
------------------------------------------------------
Soc. No, by the great-what do you call him?-not you, for you say
that power is a good to him who has the power.

Pol. I do.

Soc. And would you maintain that if a fool does what he think best,
this is a good, and would you call this great power?

Pol. I should not.

Soc. Then you must prove that the rhetorician is not a fool, and that
rhetoric is an art and not a flattery-and so you will have refuted me;
but if you leave me unrefuted, why, the rhetoricians who do what they
think best in states, and the tyrants, will have nothing upon which to
congratulate themselves, if as you say, power be indeed a good,
admitting at the same time that what is done without sense is an evil.

Pol. Yes; I admit that.

Soc. How then can the rhetoricians or the tyrants have great power
in states, unless Polus can refute Socrates, and prove to him
that they do as they will?

Pol. This fellow-

Soc. I say that they do not do as they will-now refute me.

Pol. Why, have you not already said that they do as they think best?

Soc. And I say so still.

Pol. Then surely they do as they will?

Soc. I deny it.

Pol. But they do what they think best?

Soc. Aye.

Pol. That, Socrates, is monstrous and absurd.

Soc. Good words, good Polus, as I may say in your own peculiar style;
but if you have any questions to ask of me, either prove that I am in
error or give the answer yourself.

Pol. VERy well, I am willing to answer that I may know what you mean.

Soc. Do men appear to you to will that which they do, or to will
that further end for the sake of which they do a thing? when
they take medicine, for example, at the bidding of a physician,
do they will the drinking of the medicine which is painful,
or the health for the sake of which they drink?

Pol. Clearly, the health.

Soc. And when men go on a voyage or engage in business, they do not will
that which they are doing at the time; for who would desire to take the
risk of a voyage or the trouble of business?-But they will, to have the
wealth for the sake of which they go on a voyage.

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And is not this universally TRUE? If a man does something for
the sake of something else, he wills not that which he does,
but that for the sake of which he does it.

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And are not all things either good or evil,
or intermediate and indifferent?

Pol. To be sure, Socrates.

Soc. Wisdom and health and wealth and the like you would call goods,
and their opposites evils?

Pol. I should.

Soc. And the things which are neither good nor evil, and which partake
sometimes of the nature of good and at other times of evil, or of
neither, are such as sitting, walking, running, sailing; or, again,
wood, stones, and the like:-these are the things
which you call neither good nor evil?

Pol. Exactly so.

Soc. Are these indifferent things done for the sake of the good,
or the good for the sake of the indifferent?

Pol. Clearly, the indifferent for the sake of the good.

Soc. When we walk we walk for the sake of the good, and under
the idea that it is better to walk, and when we stand
we stand equally for the sake of the good?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And when we kill a man we kill him or exile him or despoil him
of his goods, because, as we think, it will conduce to our good?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. Men who do any of these things do them for the sake of the good?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And did we not admit that in doing something for the sake of
something else, we do not will those things which we do,
but that other thing for the sake of which we do them?

Pol. Most TRUE.

Soc. Then we do not will simply to kill a man or to exile him or to
despoil him of his goods, but we will to do that which conduces to our
good, and if the act is not conducive to our good we do not will it; for
we will, as you say, that which is our good, but that which is neither
good nor evil, or simply evil, we do not will. Why are you silent,
Polus? Am I not right?

Pol. You are right.

Soc. Hence we may infer, that if any one, whether he be a tyrant or a
rhetorician, kills another or exiles another or deprives him of his
property, under the idea that the act is for his own interests when
really not for his own interests, he may be said
to do what seems best to him?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. But does he do what he wills if he does what is evil?
Why do you not answer?

Pol. Well, I suppose not.

Soc. Then if great power is a good as you allow, will such a one have
great power in a state?

Pol. He will not.

Soc. Then I was right in saying that a man may do what seems good to him
in a state, and not have great power, and not do what he wills?

Pol. As though you, Socrates, would not like to have the power of doing
what seemed good to you in the state, rather than not; you would
not be jealous when you saw any one killing or despoiling
or imprisoning whom he pleased, Oh, no!

Soc. Justly or unjustly, do you mean?

Pol. In either case is he not equally to be envied?

Soc. Forbear, Polus!

Pol. Why &quot;forbear&quot;?

Soc. Because you ought not to envy wretches
who are not to be envied, but only to pity them.

Pol. And are those of whom spoke wretches?

Soc. Yes, certainly they are.

Pol. And so you think that he who slays any one whom he pleases,
and justly slays him, is pitiable and wretched?

Soc. No, I do not say that of him:
but neither do I think that he is to be envied.

Pol. Were you not saying just now that he is wretched?

Soc. Yes, my friend, if he killed another unjustly, in which case he is
also to be pitied; and he is not to be envied if he killed him justly.

Pol. At any rate you will allow that he
who is unjustly put to death is wretched, and to be pitied?

Soc. Not so much, Polus, as he who kills him,
and not so much as he who is justly killed.

Pol. How can that be, Socrates?

Soc. That may VERy well be,
inasmuch as doing injustice is the greatest of evils.

Pol. But is it the greatest? Is not suffering injustice a greater evil?

Soc. Certainly not.

Pol. Then would you rather suffer than do injustice?

Soc. I should not like either, but if I must choose between them, I
would rather suffer than do.

Pol. Then you would not wish to be a tyrant?

Soc. Not if you mean by tyranny what I mean.

Pol. I mean, as I said before, the power of doing whatEVER seems good to
you in a state, killing, banishing, doing in all things as you like.

Soc. Well then, illustrious friend, when I have said my say, do you
reply to me. Suppose that I go into a crowded Agora, and take a dagger
under my arm. Polus, I say to you, I have just acquired rare power, and
become a tyrant; for if I think that any of these men whom you see ought
to be put to death, the man whom I have a mind to kill is as good as
dead; and if I am disposed to break his head or tear his garment, he
will have his head broken or his garment torn in an instant. Such is my
great power in this city. And if you do not believe me, and I show you
the dagger, you would probably reply: Socrates, in that sort of way any
one may have great power-he may burn any house which he pleases, and
the docks and triremes of the Athenians, and all their other vessels,
whether public or private-but can you believe that
this mere doing as you think best is great power?

Pol. Certainly not such doing as this.

Soc. But can you tell me why you disapprove of such a power?

Pol. I can.

Soc. Why then?

Pol. Why, because he who did as you say would be certain to be punished.

Soc. And punishment is an evil?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And you would admit once more, my good sir, that great power is a
benefit to a man if his actions turn out to his advantage, and that this
is the meaning of great power; and if not, then his power is an evil and
is no power. But let us look at the matter in another way do we not
acknowledge that the things of which we were speaking, the infliction
of death, and exile, and the deprivation of property are sometimes
a good and sometimes not a good?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. About that you and I may be supposed to agree?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. Tell me, then, when do you say that they are good
and when that they are evil-what principle do you lay down?

Pol. I would rather, Socrates,
that you should answer as well as ask that question.

Soc. Well, Polus, since you would rather have the answer from me,
I say that they are good when they are just, and evil when they are unjust.

Pol. You are hard of refutation, Socrates,
but might not a child refute that statement?

Soc. Then I shall be VERy grateful to the child, and equally grateful to
you if you will refute me and deliver me from my foolishness. And I hope
that refute me you will, and not weary of doing good to a friend.

Pol. Yes, Socrates, and I need not go far or appeal to antiquity;
events which happened only a few days ago are enough to refute you,
and to prove that many men who do wrong are happy.

Soc. What events?

Pol. You see, I presume, that Archelaus the son of Perdiccas
is now the ruler of Macedonia?

Soc. At any rate I hear that he is.

Pol. And do you think that he is happy or miserable?

Soc. I cannot say, Polus, for I have nEVER had
any acquaintance with him.

Pol. And cannot you tell at once, and without having
an acquaintance with him, whether a man is happy?

Soc. Most certainly not.

Pol. Then clearly, Socrates, you would say that you did not
even know whether the great king was a happy man?

Soc. And I should speak the TRUTH; for I do not know
how he stands in the matter of education and justice.

Pol. What! and does all happiness consist in this?

Soc. Yes, indeed, Polus, that is my doctrine; the men and women
who are gentle and good are also happy, as I maintain,
and the unjust and evil are miserable.

Pol. Then, according to your doctrine, the said Archelaus is miserable?

Soc. Yes, my friend, if he is wicked.

Pol. That he is wicked I cannot deny; for he had no title at all to the
throne which he now occupies, he being only the son of a woman who was
the slave of Alcetas the brother of Perdiccas; he himself therefore in
strict right was the slave of Alcetas; and if he had meant to do rightly
he would have remained his slave, and then, according to your doctrine,
he would have been happy. But now he is unspeakably miserable, for he
has been guilty of the greatest crimes: in the first place he invited
his uncle and master, Alcetas, to come to him, under the pretence that
he would restore to him the throne which Perdiccas has usurped, and
after entertaining him and his son Alexander, who was his own cousin,
and nearly of an age with him, and making them drunk, he threw them into
a waggon and carried them off by night, and slew them, and got both of
them out of the way; and when he had done all this wickedness he nEVER
discoVEREd that he was the most miserable of all men, was VERy far from
repenting: shall I tell you how he showed his remorse? he had a younger
brother, a child of seven years old, who was the legitimate son of
Perdiccas, and to him of right the kingdom belonged; Archelaus, howEVER,
had no mind to bring him up as he ought and restore the kingdom to him;
that was not his notion of happiness; but not long afterwards he threw
him into a well and drowned him, and declared to his mother Cleopatra
that he had fallen in while running after a goose, and had been killed.
And now as he is the greatest criminal of all the Macedonians, he may be
supposed to be the most miserable and not the happiest of them, and I
dare say that there are many Athenians, and you would be at the head of
them, who would rather be any other Macedonian than Archelaus!

Soc. I praised you at first, Polus, for being a rhetorician rather than
a reasoner. And this, as I suppose, is the sort of argument with which
you fancy that a child might refute me, and by which I stand refuted
when I say that the unjust man is not happy. But, my good friend, where
is the refutation? I cannot admit a word which you have been saying.

Pol. That is because you will not; for you surely must think as I do.

Soc. Not so, my simple friend, but because you will refute me after the
manner which rhetoricians practise in courts of law. For there the one
party think that they refute the other when they bring forward a number
of witnesses of good repute in proof of their allegations, and their
adversary has only a single one or none at all. But this kind of proof
is of no value where TRUTH is the aim; a man may often be sworn down by
a multitude of false witnesses who have a great air of respectability.
And in this argument nearly EVERy one, Athenian and stranger alike,
would be on your side, if you should bring witnesses in disproof of my
statement-you may, if you will, summon Nicias the son of Niceratus, and
let his brothers, who gave the row of tripods which stand in the
precincts of Dionysus, come with him; or you may summon Aristocrates,
the son of Scellius, who is the giver of that famous offering which is
at Delphi; summon, if you will, the whole house of Pericles, or any
other great Athenian family whom you choose-they will all agree with
you: I only am left alone and cannot agree, for you do not convince me;
although you produce many false witnesses against me, in the hope of
depriving me of my inheritance, which is the TRUTH. But I consider that
nothing worth speaking of will have been effected by me unless I make
you the one witness of my words; nor by you, unless you make me the one
witness of yours; no matter about the rest of the world. For there are
two ways of refutation, one which is yours and that of the world in
general; but mine is of another sort-let us compare them, and see in
what they differ. For, indeed, we are at issue about matters which to
know is honourable and not to know disgraceful; to know or not to know
happiness and misery-that is the chief of them. And what knowledge can
be nobler? or what ignorance more disgraceful than this? And therefore I
will begin by asking you whether you do not think that a man who is
unjust and doing injustice can be happy, seeing that you think Archelaus
unjust, and yet happy? May I assume this to be your opinion?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. But I say that this is an impossibility-here is one point about
which we are at issue:-VERy good. And do you mean to say also that if he
meets with retribution and punishment he will still be happy?

Pol. Certainly not; in that case he will be most miserable.

Soc. On the other hand, if the unjust be not punished, then, according
to you, he will be happy?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. But in my opinion, Polus, the unjust or doer of unjust actions is
miserable in any case,-more miserable, howEVER, if he be not punished
and does not meet with retribution, and less miserable if he be punished
and meets with retribution at the hands of gods and men.

Pol. You are maintaining a strange doctrine, Socrates.

Soc. I shall try to make you agree with me, O my friend, for as a friend
I regard you. Then these are the points at issue between us-are they
not? I was saying that to do is worse than to suffer injustice?

Pol. Exactly so.

Soc. And you said the opposite?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. I said also that the wicked are miserable, and you refuted me?

Pol. By Zeus, I did.

Soc. In your own opinion, Polus.

Pol. Yes, and I rather suspect that I was in the right.

Soc. You further said that the wrong-doer is happy if he be unpunished?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And I affirm that he is most miserable, and that those who are
punished are less miserable-are you going to refute this proposition
also?

Pol. A proposition which is harder of refutation
than the other, Socrates.

Soc. Say rather, Polus, impossible; for who can refute the TRUTH?

Pol. What do you mean? If a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make
himself a tyrant, and when detected is racked, mutilated, has his eyes
burned out, and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted
on him, and having seen his wife and children suffer the like, is at
last impaled or tarred and burned alive, will he be happier than if he
escape and become a tyrant, and continue all through life doing what
he likes and holding the reins of government, the envy and admiration
both of citizens and strangers? Is that the paradox which, as you say,
cannot be refuted?

Soc. There again, noble Polus, you are raising hobgoblins instead
of refuting me; just now you were calling witnesses against me.
But please to refresh my memory a little; did you say-
&quot;in an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant&quot;?

Pol. Yes, I did.

Soc. Then I say that neither of them will be happier than the
other-neither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny, nor he who suffers in
the attempt, for of two miserables one cannot be the happier, but that
he who escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two. Do
you laugh, Polus? Well, this is a new kind of refutation-when any one
says anything, instead of refuting him to laugh at him.

Pol. But do you not think, Socrates, that you have been sufficiently
refuted, when you say that which no human being will allow? Ask the
company.

Soc. O Polus, I am not a public man, and only last year, when my tribe
were serving as Prytanes, and it became my duty as their president to
take the votes, there was a laugh at me, because I was unable to take
them. And as I failed then, you must not ask me to count the suffrages
of the company now; but if, as I was saying, you have no better argument
than numbers, let me have a turn, and do you make trial of the sort of
proof which, as I think, is required; for I shall produce one witness
only of the TRUTH of my words, and he is the person with whom I am
arguing; his suffrage I know how to take; but with the many I have
nothing to do, and do not even address myself to them. May I ask then
whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof?
For I certainly think that I and you and EVERy man do really believe,
that to do is a greater evil than to suffer injustice: and not to be
punished than to be punished.

Pol. And I should say neither I, nor any man: would you yourself,
for example, suffer rather than do injustice?

Soc. Yes, and you, too; I or any man would.

Pol. Quite the rEVERse; neither you, nor I, nor any man.

Soc. But will you answer?

Pol. To be sure, I will-for I am curious
to hear what you can have to say.

Soc. Tell me, then, and you will know, and let us suppose that
I am beginning at the beginning: which of the two, Polus,
in your opinion, is the worst?-to do injustice or to suffer?

Pol. I should say that suffering was worst.

Soc. And which is the greater disgrace?-Answer.

Pol. To do.

Soc. And the greater disgrace is the greater evil?

Pol. Certainly not.

Soc. I understand you to say, if I am not mistaken, that the
honourable is not the same as the good, or the disgraceful as the evil?

Pol. Certainly not.

Soc. Let me ask a question of you: When you speak of beautiful things,
such as bodies, colours, figures, sounds, institutions, do you not call
them beautiful in reference to some standard: bodies, for example,
are beautiful in proportion as they are useful, or as the sight
of them gives pleasure to the spectators; can you give
any other account of personal beauty?

Pol. I cannot.

Soc. And you would say of figures or colours generally that
they were beautiful, either by reason of the pleasure which they give,
or of their use, or both?

Pol. Yes, I should.

Soc. And you would call sounds and music beautiful for the same reason?

Pol. I should.

Soc. Laws and institutions also have no beauty in them except in so far
as they are useful or pleasant or both?

Pol. I think not.

Soc. And may not the same be said of the beauty of knowledge?

Pol. To be sure, Socrates; and I VERy much approve of your measuring
beauty by the standard of pleasure and utility.

Soc. And deformity or disgrace may be equally measured
by the opposite standard of pain and evil?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. Then when of two beautiful things one exceeds in beauty,
the measure of the excess is to be taken in one or both of these;
that is to say, in pleasure or utility or both?

Pol. VERy TRUE.

Soc. And of two deformed things, that which exceeds in deformity
or disgrace, exceeds either in pain or evil-must it not be so?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. But then again, what was the observation which you just now made,
about doing and suffering wrong? Did you not say,
that suffering wrong was more evil, and doing wrong more disgraceful?

Pol. I did.

Soc. Then, if doing wrong is more disgraceful than suffering, the more
disgraceful must be more painful and must exceed in pain or in evil or
both: does not that also follow?

Pol. Of course.

Soc. First, then, let us consider whether the doing
of injustice exceeds the suffering in the consequent pain:
Do the injurers suffer more than the injured?

Pol. No, Socrates; certainly not.

Soc. Then they do not exceed in pain?

Pol. No.

Soc. But if not in pain, then not in both?

Pol. Certainly not.

Soc. Then they can only exceed in the other?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. That is to say, in evil?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. Then doing injustice will have an excess of evil,
and will therefore be a greater evil than suffering injustice?

Pol. Clearly.

Soc. But have not you and the world already agreed that to do injustice
is more disgraceful than to suffer?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And that is now discoVEREd to be more evil?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And would you prefer a greater evil or a greater dishonour to a
less one? Answer, Polus, and fear not; for you will come to no harm if
you nobly resign yourself into the healing hand of the argument as to a
physician without shrinking, and either say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to me.

Pol. I should say &quot;No.&quot;

Soc. Would any other man prefer a greater to a less evil?

Pol. No, not according to this way of putting the case, Socrates.

Soc. Then I said truly, Polus that neither you, nor I, nor any man,
would rather, do than suffer injustice; for to do injustice is the
greater evil of the two.

Pol. That is the conclusion.

Soc. You see, Polus, when you compare the two kinds of refutations, how
unlike they are. All men, with the exception of myself, are of your way
of thinking; but your single assent and witness are enough for me-I have
no need of any other, I take your suffrage, and am regardless of the
rest. Enough of this, and now let us proceed to the next question; which
is, Whether the greatest of evils to a guilty man is to suffer
punishment, as you supposed, or whether to escape punishment is not a
greater evil, as I supposed. Consider:-You would say that to suffer
punishment is another name for being justly corrected when you do wrong?

Pol. I should.

Soc. And would you not allow that all just things are honourable in so
far as they are just? Please to reflect, and, tell me your opinion.

Pol. Yes, Socrates, I think that they are.

Soc. Consider again:-Where there is an agent,
must there not also be a patient?

Pol. I should say so.

Soc. And will not the patient suffer that which the agent does, and will
not the suffering have the quality of the action? I mean, for example,
that if a man strikes, there must be something which is stricken?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And if the striker strikes violently or quickly,
that which is struck will he struck violently or quickly?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And the suffering to him who is stricken is
of the same nature as the act of him who strikes?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And if a man burns, there is something which is burned?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And if he burns in excess or so as to cause pain,
the thing burned will be burned in the same way?

Pol. Truly.

Soc. And if he cuts, the same argument holds
-there will be something cut?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And if the cutting be great or deep or such as will cause pain,
the cut will be of the same nature?

Pol. That is evident.

Soc. Then you would agree generally to the universal proposition which
I was just now asserting: that the affection of the patient answers
to the affection of the agent?

Pol. I agree.

Soc. Then, as this is admitted, let me ask
whether being punished is suffering or acting?

Pol. Suffering, Socrates; there can be no doubt of that.

Soc. And suffering implies an agent?

Pol. Certainly, Socrates; and he is the punisher.

Soc. And he who punishes rightly, punishes justly?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And therefore he acts justly?

Pol. Justly.

Soc. Then he who is punished and suffers retribution, suffers justly?

Pol. That is evident.

Soc. And that which is just has been admitted to be honourable?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. Then the punisher does what is honourable,
and the punished suffers what is honourable?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And if what is honourable, then what is good,
for the honourable is either pleasant or useful?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. Then he who is punished suffers what is good?

Pol. That is TRUE.

Soc. Then he is benefited?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. Do I understand you to mean what I mean by the term &quot;benefited&quot;?
I mean, that if he be justly punished his soul is improved.

Pol. Surely.

Soc. Then he who is punished is deliVEREd from the evil of his soul?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And is he not then deliVEREd from the greatest evil?
Look at the matter in this way:-In respect of a man's estate,
do you see any greater evil than poverty?

Pol. There is no greater evil.

Soc. Again, in a man's bodily frame, you would say
that the evil is weakness and disease and deformity?

Pol. I should.

Soc. And do you not imagine that the soul likewise
has some evil of her own?

Pol. Of course.

Soc. And this you would call injustice and ignorance
and cowardice, and the like?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. So then, in mind, body, and estate, which are three, you have
pointed out three corresponding evils-injustice, disease, poverty?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And which of the evils is the most disgraceful?-Is not the most
disgraceful of them injustice, and in general the evil of the soul?

Pol. By far the most.

Soc. And if the most disgraceful, then also the worst?

Pol. What do you mean, Socrates?

Soc. I mean to say, that is most disgraceful has been
already admitted to be most painful or hurtful, or both.

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And now injustice and all evil in the soul has been admitted
by to be most disgraceful?

Pol. It has been admitted.

Soc. And most disgraceful either because most painful
and causing excessive pain, or most hurtful, or both?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And therefore to be unjust and intemperate, and cowardly
and ignorant, is more painful than to be poor and sick?

Pol. Nay, Socrates; the painfulness does not appear to me
to follow from your premises.

Soc. Then, if, as you would argue, not more painful, the evil of the
soul is of all evils the most disgraceful; and the excess of
disgrace must be caused by some preternatural greatness,
or extraordinary hurtfulness of the evil.

Pol. Clearly.

Soc. And that which exceeds most in hurtfulness
will be the greatest of evils?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. Then injustice and intemperance, and in general
the depravity of the soul, are the greatest of evils!

Pol. That is evident.

Soc. Now, what art is there which delivers us from poverty?
Does not the art of making money?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And what art frees us from disease? Does not the art of medicine?

Pol. VERy TRUE.

Soc. And what from vice and injustice? If you are not able to answer
at once, ask yourself whither we go with the sick,
and to whom we take them.

Pol. To the physicians, Socrates.

Soc. And to whom do we go with the unjust and intemperate?

Pol. To the judges, you mean.

Soc. -Who are to punish them?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And do not those who rightly punish others, punish them
in accordance with a certain rule of justice?

Pol. Clearly.

Soc. Then the art of money-making frees a man from poverty;
medicine from disease; and justice from intemperance and injustice?

Pol. That is evident.

Soc. Which, then, is the best of these three?

Pol. Will you enumerate them?

Soc. Money-making, medicine, and justice.

Pol. Justice, Socrates, far excels the two others.

Soc. And justice, if the best,
gives the greatest pleasure or advantage or both?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. But is the being healed a pleasant thing,
and are those who are being healed pleased?

Pol. I think not.

Soc. A useful thing, then?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. Yes, because the patient is deliVEREd from a great evil;
and this is the advantage of enduring the pain-that you get well?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. And would he be the happier man in his bodily condition,
who is healed, or who nEVER was out of health?

Pol. Clearly he who was nEVER out of health.

Soc. Yes; for happiness surely does not consist
in being deliVEREd from evils, but in nEVER having had them.

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And suppose the case of two persons who have some evil
in their bodies, and that one of them is healed and deliVEREd
from evil, and another is not healed, but retains the evil
-which of them is the most miserable?

Pol. Clearly he who is not healed.

Soc. And was not punishment said by us to be
a DEliVERance from the greatest of evils, which is vice?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And justice punishes us, and makes us more just,
and is the medicine of our vice?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. He, then, has the first place in the scale of happiness
who has nEVER had vice in his soul;
for this has been shown to be the greatest of evils.

Pol. Clearly.

Soc. And he has the second place, who is deliVEREd from vice?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. That is to say, he who receives admonition
and rebuke and punishment?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. Then he lives worst, who, having been unjust,
has no DEliVERance from injustice?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. That is, he lives worst who commits the greatest crimes, and who,
being the most unjust of men, succeeds in escaping rebuke or correction
or punishment; and this, as you say, has been accomplished by Archelaus
and other tyrants and rhetoricians and potentates?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. May not their way of proceeding, my friend, be compared to the
conduct of a person who is afflicted with the worst of diseases and yet
contrives not to pay the penalty to the physician for his sins against
his constitution, and will not be cured, because, like a child, he is
afraid of the pain of being burned or cut:-Is not that a parallel case?

Pol. Yes, truly.

Soc. He would seem as if he did not know the nature of health and bodily
vigour; and if we are right, Polus, in our previous conclusions, they
are in a like case who strive to evade justice, which they see to be
painful, but are blind to the advantage which ensues from it, not
knowing how far more miserable a companion a diseased soul is than a
diseased body; a soul, I say, which is corrupt and unrighteous and
unholy. And hence they do all that they can to avoid punishment and to
avoid being released from the greatest of evils; they provide themselves
with money and friends, and cultivate to the utmost their powers of
persuasion. But if we, Polus, are right, do you see what follows,
or shall we draw out the consequences in form?

Pol. If you please.

Soc. Is it not a fact that injustice, and the doing of injustice,
is the greatest of evils?

Pol. That is quite clear.

Soc. And further, that to suffer punishment is the way
to be released from this evil?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And not to suffer, is to perpetuate the evil?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. To do wrong, then, is second only in the scale of evils; but
to do wrong and not to be punished, is first and greatest of all?

Pol. That is TRUE.

Soc. Well, and was not this the point in dispute, my friend? You deemed
Archelaus happy, because he was a VERy great criminal and unpunished: I,
on the other hand, maintained that he or any other who like him has done
wrong and has not been punished, is, and ought to be, the most miserable
of all men; and that the doer of injustice is more miserable than the
sufferer; and he who escapes punishment, more miserable
than he who suffers.-Was not that what I said?

Pol. Yes.

Soc. And it has been proved to be TRUE?

Pol. Certainly.

Soc. Well, Polus, but if this is TRUE, where is the great use
of rhetoric? If we admit what has been just now said,
EVERy man ought in EVERy way to guard himself
against doing wrong, for he will thereby suffer great evil?

Pol. TRUE.

Soc. And if he, or any one about whom he cares, does wrong, he ought of
his own accord to go where he will be immediately punished; he will run
to the judge, as he would to the physician, in order that the disease of
injustice may not be rendered chronic and become the incurable cancer
of the soul; must we not allow this consequence, Polus, if our former
admissions are to stand:-is any other inference consistent with them?

Pol. To that, Socrates, there can be but one answer.

Soc. Then rhetoric is of no use to us, Polus, in helping a man to excuse
his own injustice, that of his parents or friends, or children or
country; but may be of use to any one who holds that instead of excusing
he ought to accuse-himself above all, and in the next degree his family
or any of his friends who may be doing wrong; he should bring to light
the iniquity and not conceal it, that so the wrong-doer may suffer and
be made whole; and he should even force himself and others not to
shrink, but with closed eyes like brave men to let the physician operate
with knife or searing iron, not regarding the pain, in the hope of
attaining the good and the honourable; let him who has done things
worthy of stripes, allow himself to be scourged, if of bonds, to be
bound, if of a fine, to be fined, if of exile, to be exiled, if of
death, to die, himself being the first to accuse himself and his
relations, and using rhetoric to this end, that his and their unjust
actions may be made manifest, and that they themselves may be deliVEREd
from injustice, which is the greatest evil. Then, Polus, rhetoric would
indeed be useful. Do you say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to that?

Pol. To me, Socrates, what you are saying appears VERy strange,
though probably in agreement with your premises.

Soc. Is not this the conclusion, if the premises are not disproven?

Pol. Yes; it certainly is.
