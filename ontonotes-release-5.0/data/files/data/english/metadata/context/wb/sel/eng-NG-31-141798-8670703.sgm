*SYNOPSIS*

Twelve women disrobe on the streets of Manipur, in protest… For over six
years a young woman has been on a fast-to-death demanding justice; she is
kept under arrest by the government and is forcibly nose-fed for this
&quot;crime&quot;. Why are the women of Manipur using their bodies as their last
weapon?

Manipur - a state in the North-East region of India – has for decades been
torn by insurgency and armed conflict. The Indian government has attempted
to crush the insurgency through its military power, shielded by a drastic
law that allows the security forces to shoot, arrest or kill on suspicion
alone. Yet, little is heard about Manipur and its simmering trouble's across
the nation's landscape. This is a place that mainland India has marginalised;
that the world has forgotten.

The film travels to this forgotten, strife-torn corner of India to document
the extraordinary protests of Manipuri women as they fight for justice for
their people.
