I have an '84 Chevy Silverado that I am trying to find interior parts for. I
specifically need:

o Both door panels, brushed alumninum trim, and pull handles
o Dash pad and brushed aluminum trim
o A/C vents

Wrecking yards don't have anything and the auto parts catalogs that I've seen
are SERIOUSLY expensive. They all tell me that GM hasn't sold the tooling
for reproducing the parts yet, so they are just reselling GM parts and there
is no aftermarket producer. Anyway, $200 for the bare door panel (both doors)
is a bit rich for my blood. They even want $250 for the dash pad!! I won't
mention the cost of the trim peices! I found molded carpeting with padding and
the carpeted lower door panel for $95 total! Hell, the headliner was only
$55!! Why the heck are the door panel and trim pieces so expensive!

If you have any advice for me, I would love to hear it. Down here in Texas,
trucks bring (and cost) serious money. Thanks...
