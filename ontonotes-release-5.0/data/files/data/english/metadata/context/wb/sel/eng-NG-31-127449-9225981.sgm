Pleo, the amazing robotic dinosaur.

http://www.pleoworld.com/

He's a &quot;life form.&quot; Not just for kids. Developers Forum coming soon,
they say. You have to see the videos to appreciate. I wish I had the
spare cash lying around to get one. I'm afraid my cat might actually
get jealous of this thing, however. Comes with USB connectivity for
firmware updates, etc..

They had one on the Gadget Show this week, where they put three new
robots through their paces in front of an audience. Pleo came in last
place, and Roboboa came first.

http://www.robotsrule.com/html/roboboa.php

And that was without the audience being told that Pleo was 4 times the
price of Roboboa.

[The video on that page really doesn't do it any favours, it looked much
cooler on the Gadget Show.]

I think it's a different kind of product.. The pleo seems to be more
geared towards the consumer, but has additional features for only the
more advanced enthusiast. The pleo thing is more like a pet that
develops depending on the input one gives it, and is a lot more
advanced than that roboboa thing. Seriously. And the putting of the
robots through the paces thing would depend on the age and the amount
of interactivity that the pleo had experienced. They probably used an
&quot;infant.&quot;

The Pleo introduction was delayed a few months back. They discovered that
the batteries were getting too hot during recharging. Their solution was to
require that the battery pack be removed during charging, which sounds like
a bit of a PITA to me.

I used to have a little battery operated toy in the shape of a dog. It
was maybe 6-8 inches high. The toy looked just like my black
schnoodle, which is why my then FIL gave it to us. When switched on,
it would yip-yip-yip and move forward if on a smooth surface. They it
would do a backward summersault and land on its legs and start with
the yip stuff all over again.

My dog went mad over it. Not angry or upset, but wildly tried to get
the toy dog to pay attention to him.

If you'd had two little robots, you could've turned the second one
off, too.  You could have turned off your schnoodle, but that can get
messy.

Actually I think it's cute that your dog wanted it to play with him.
Reminds me of a friend's chihuahua.  There were three of us playing
with the dog with laser pointers.  At first the dog didn't notice
there were three dots, until we all pointed them right in front of
him.  When all three dots went different directions the dog wanted to
chase all of them.  He stood there and quivered for a second or two,
trying to decide which one to chase.  After we stopped laughing we
turned off two of the pointers before the dog had a nervous
breakdown.

You should really worry if he starts talking about &quot;Pleo, the amazing

Silly! You can only access the advanced features after Pleo has
reached adulthood. It takes nurturing.

&gt;I want this one:

&gt;But it's too expensive.
">

That's pretty awesome, but upon further inspection I think that the
Pleo has more sensors than the omroncat. See here:

http://www.pleoworld.com/discover/lookinside

Plus he has force feed sensors to shut down one particular motor if
there is violent movement to the limb. He might even limp after you
submit him to that type of abuse. Color camera, two mikes, two
speakers.. But I think the software is the real tell all. They seem to
be somewhat similar in that regard.

They need to have a Pleo in cat form.

&gt;&gt; I used to have a little battery operated toy in the shape of a

&gt;&gt; switched on, it would yip-yip-yip and move forward if on a
&gt;&gt; smooth surface. They it would do a backward summersault and land
&gt;&gt; on its legs and start with the yip stuff all over again.

&gt;Good toy.  Just like a real little yappy dog, but you can *turn it
&gt;off*.

&gt;&gt; My dog went mad over it. Not angry or upset, but wildly tried to
&gt;&gt; get the toy dog to pay attention to him.

&gt;If you'd had two little robots, you could've turned the second one
&gt;off, too.  You could have turned off your schnoodle, but that can get
&gt;messy.

&gt;Actually I think it's cute that your dog wanted it to play with him.
&gt;Reminds me of a friend's chihuahua.  There were three of us playing
&gt;with the dog with laser pointers.  At first the dog didn't notice

Dog?  You were talking about a chihuahua just now.

I'll admit that I have occasionally edited my sentences to make them
more quotable, but that one is just a happy chance.  I had in mind an
