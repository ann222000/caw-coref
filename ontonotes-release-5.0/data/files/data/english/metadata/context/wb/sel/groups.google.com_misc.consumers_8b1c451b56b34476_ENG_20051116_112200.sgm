"/> Alitalia has one huge advantage if you are going to, from or
connecting at FCO. Their gate agents are typically 25-35 year old hot
Italian females. In addition, they generally smell nice too.

&gt;&gt;Is this indeed true? I wish to avoid this carrier in the future.

&gt; Most European airlines, including Alitalia, started life as government
&gt; corporations. Some have been privatized, either fully or partially.
&gt; But the government mindset is still present in the workers and the
&gt; corporate culture. Think about how good any airline would be if it
&gt; were run by postal workers or the employees down at your local DMV and
&gt; you will understand Alitalia.

"/> Well said, and funny.

I would like to know what features of Alitalia earned it the OP's award
of *evilly awful* today. I think I've bumped into less than exemplary
employees at every airline I've flown but this sounds like something
I've never experienced. I haven't flown Alitalia, but my daughter has at
least a half dozen times on UM status since the age of 7. Alitalia
treated her better than Lufthansa.

&quot;If you want to experience how bad an airline can really get, fly
Olympic, the national airline of Greece.&quot;

Olympic is well known as the worst Western European airline. But it's
still way better than some of the worst Asian and Latin American
airlines. I flew a Latin American airline where the stewardesses wake
you up when you try to sleep, there were bugs crawling on the meal, the
traytable broke off when I tried to lower it, and the plane rattled
noisily as it came in to the runway. A co-associate at my old law firm
flew Biman Air Bangladesh to save $100 on a flight to Bangkok. Fluid
leaked on his head throughout the flight, and they cancelled his onward
flight, so he was stuck in Bangladesh's capital for days until they
finally had another flight.

"/> A decade or two ago I flew a Capitol Airlines (based in Tennessee) DC-8 from
Chicago to Europe, and you could not see out the window it was so scratched
up, the chicken served for dinner was frozen solid, and the seatbelt came
right out of the seat in my hand when I pulled it up to buckle

"/> I don't know which are the worst Asian and Latin American airlines, but the
two *best* flights I've ever had were on Asian and Latin American airlines:
Singapore and Varig.
