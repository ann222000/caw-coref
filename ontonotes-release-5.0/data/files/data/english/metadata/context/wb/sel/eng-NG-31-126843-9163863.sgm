Brainstorming: A method to vote on Board members

Before the selection of Board members begins, a vote manager calls for
people to register an intent to vote. These are posted to a thread on
news.groups.  Anyone with a Usenet posting history may register.  Everybody
examines the voter registrations and may challenge any that look
suspicious. For example, someone might observe registrations for Jayne
Kulikauskas and Obvi S. Jaynsok and claim that these are the same person.
(Ideally people should support challenges with evidence.) A tribunal
investigates and makes decisions on challenges, posting its results. In the
previous example, they would find that these two posting identities do
belong to the same person and she would not be permitted to register. After
a previously announced amount of time, registration is closed. If at all
possible, registered voters should participate in the next stage of the
process, at least, by reading the posts.

People who wish to be on the Board announce their candidacies on
news.groups, where they also present their views on hierarchy management
and answer questions and objections from all.  After a previously announced
period of time, this stage is closed and the vote manager calls the vote.
Registered voters cast their votes on news.groups and the manager tallies
the results.  Everyone scrutinizes the votes and results.  There is another
challenge period with a tribunal investigating and making decisions which
they post along with the final result.

Assuming that this method is being used to replace retiring Board members,
rather than the entire Board, the remaining Board members may, by unanimous
vote, veto half of the elected new members. For example, if elections are
held for three new members, the Board may veto two of them.  (Or would
rounding down, be better? Or avoiding the problem by only voting for even
numbers of members?)
================================

The intent of this post is to promote brainstorming.  Feel free to critique
this method, present refinements, or suggest something entirely different.

Contrary to recent Bamby lies, this has no intrinsic connection with
voting. There's no imaginable reason for not implementing it at once,
unless the Bambies' aim is gradually to convert themselves into a
secret cabal whose members are known only to each other. (It's quite
possible that that's their aim, given that one of them has already
faked his own resignation.)

The first registration is to discourage people who are unaware of the
issues from voting.  Everyone who registers to vote will know about and
have the opportunity to participate in the questioning of candidates.

Also, two opportunities for scrutiny increase the security.

You have previous stated that one reason you object to voting is that you
are afraid that Tim Skirvin would be elected.  You seem to me to be saying
that you do not want elections because you do not think it would give the
results you want.  I am very uncomfortable with this kind of reasoning. I
would like to see us seeking a selection method that we see as an
intrinsically good method.

I have noticed that people talk about Board members &quot;hiding in their

Apparently your tenacity in trying to get him to stick to the point

What part or parts of the evidence were you not convinced by?

The Kamens case is much simpler than the Skirvin case, so less time

These seem to be reasonable points. But to be honest I'm not really

either Gary or Adam intended to express support for voting, but only
they can clear the question up.

Beware of the Moleski Mistake, which is to assume that anybody who
makes a tangential comment about something is really in favour of or
against it. As I've said before, his list of &quot;friends of the proposed
treehouse&quot; and &quot;enemies of the proposed treehouse&quot; was truly
hilarious.

Yes: I want the result to be a competent, trustworthy team of
hierarchy administrators.

Self-perpetuating benevolent dictatorship has served the Big Eight
pretty well over the years. I don't think the present troubles require
a complete change to a different system, and some of my faith in the
current junta would be restored if they expelled their most obviously
non-benevolent member.

A while ago, David Formosa started a &quot;brainstorming&quot; thread here, to
which I contributed the idea of a partly appointed, partly elected
board, somewhat along the lines of the uk.* system. Like you, I was
interested in seeing what people thought of the idea, rather than
being wholly committed to it - in fact, I didn't support the idea
myself, but thought it should be mentioned as an option. What I didn't
do was to elaborate the idea after nobody expressed support for it.

I think you're wasting your time. Nobody really wants anything like
what you're working on.

Nevertheless, various recent posts from you, Aatu and Konstantin
Miller (the sci.comp.networkcoding proposal) have at least
demonstrated that news.groups can be far from &quot;toxic&quot;. We (tinw) just
want to be given something non-toxic in tone and content to reply to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; good method.

I see the &quot;self-perpetuating benevolent dictatorship&quot; model as
providing an intrinsically good method - or at least a method that
isn't as bad as the alternatives. Problems arose when the retiring
dictators appointed the wrong successors. But even now I think that
probably between two and five of the current Bambies are benevolent in
their intentions, even though their choices are often wrong. If there
are five of them, they're in the majority!

Yes. Are the ones who always hide in their treehouse better or worse
than the ones who sometimes emerge to indulge in a little trolling?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I criticised the Bambies when they newgroups the WoW group, and I
criticised them when they rmgrouped it. There's no inconsistency,
since the criticisms were made for different reasons.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I know that I would find it difficult to take my critics seriously

I think you make more effort to understand what the critics are saying
than the Bambies have ever done.

assessment of Tim Skirvin. Yes, if it were just me, it would be reasonable
to suspect that I was merely affected by my tendency to think well of
people.  But it isn't just me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A while ago, David Formosa started a &quot;brainstorming&quot; thread here, to
&gt; which I contributed the idea of a partly appointed, partly elected
&gt; board, somewhat along the lines of the uk.* system. Like you, I was
&gt; interested in seeing what people thought of the idea, rather than
&gt; being wholly committed to it - in fact, I didn't support the idea
&gt; myself, but thought it should be mentioned as an option. What I didn't
&gt; do was to elaborate the idea after nobody expressed support for it.
">

I do not intend to pursue it if there is no interest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you're wasting your time. Nobody really wants anything like
&gt; what you're working on.

I find it rather difficult to tell what people on news.groups really want.
There is a tendency for people to express themselves in terms of what they
don't want.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nevertheless, various recent posts from you, Aatu and Konstantin
&gt; Miller (the sci.comp.networkcoding proposal) have at least
&gt; demonstrated that news.groups can be far from &quot;toxic&quot;. We (tinw) just
&gt; want to be given something non-toxic in tone and content to reply to.
">

That I should live to see this day!! To see myself included in the same
breath as the great Aatu himself! (even if I had to share the honour with
the latest proponent) I think that I shall swoon. ...

Now that I have somewhat recovered my composure, let me address your
comment. While I do support the existence of n.g.p for discussion of
proposals, I think it should be strictly limited to that.  I believe it is
helpful to have tightly focussed discussions for RFDs.  However, the same
tight focus that I see as helpful in that context also stifles creativity,
humour and sense of community.  Because it is unmoderated, news.groups is
inherently the more human and more interesting group. It has great
potential and I don't want to see it written off as toxic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I am very uncomfortable with this kind of reasoning. I would like to
&gt;&gt; see us seeking a selection method that we see as an intrinsically
&gt;&gt; good method.

&gt; I see the &quot;self-perpetuating benevolent dictatorship&quot; model as
&gt; providing an intrinsically good method - or at least a method that
&gt; isn't as bad as the alternatives. Problems arose when the retiring
&gt; dictators appointed the wrong successors. But even now I think that
&gt; probably between two and five of the current Bambies are benevolent in
&gt; their intentions, even though their choices are often wrong. If there
&gt; are five of them, they're in the majority!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The intent of this post is to promote brainstorming.  Feel free to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critique this method, present refinements, or suggest something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely different.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've already made three suggestions, and nobody but a couple of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; more trollish Bambies has objected to any of them.

&gt;&gt; I have noticed that people talk about Board members &quot;hiding in their
&gt;&gt; treehouse&quot; when they don't post to news.groups and yet you call them
&gt;&gt; trolls when they do.

&gt; Yes. Are the ones who always hide in their treehouse better or worse
&gt; than the ones who sometimes emerge to indulge in a little trolling?

&gt;&gt; If people criticize the Board, no matter what it does, it devalues
&gt;&gt; criticism.

&gt; I criticised the Bambies when they newgroups the WoW group, and I
&gt; criticised them when they rmgrouped it. There's no inconsistency,
&gt; since the criticisms were made for different reasons.
">

But if it is all criticism, all the time, no commercials, no talk shows, it
is not very effective.  While I'm nowhere near as negative about it as you
are, I do think that there is room for improvement in the Board.  I think
that it would benefit from more accountability, more transparency, and
clearer communication. Coming up with concrete, specific and measurable
ways to implement these principles seems to me to be a more productive
approach.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I know that I would find it difficult to take my critics seriously
&gt;&gt; and be responsive to their comments under such circumstances.

&gt; I think you make more effort to understand what the critics are saying
&gt; than the Bambies have ever done.
">

It wouldn't surprise me if they were making the effort but it just didn't
show.  That sort of thing can be difficult to communicate, especially in a
situation where there is already bad feeling.

&gt; I did not consciously adopt that model, but it is certainly possible it
&gt; influenced me.  I did notice the similarity after I had sent off the post.
">

Detecting the differences and similarities between such posters as
&quot;Jayne Kulikauskas&quot; and &quot;Obvi S. Jaynsok&quot; helped to make AUK
vote-wrangling fun for me.

For two years I had the pleasure of watching people trying to &quot;game
the system&quot; in AUK. In that time I'm aware of having accepted two
ballot papers I should have refused and refused one ballot paper I
should have accepted. That's a failure rate of about 0.3%. No results
were affected by my three mistakes, and if they had been I've have
corrected them by posting a further ballot.

So when *I* speak about vote fraud, I speak as somebody who spent two
years detecting vote fraud successfully in circumstances where fraud
was just as likely, if not more so, as it ever was in Big-8 votes. My
successors, Sean Monaghan and Pinku Sensei, have also demonstrated
much competence in fraud detection.

Perhaps we three experts should be consulted before it's asserted that
vote fraud can't possibly be eliminated without paying money?

Of course, I'll charge a consultation fee before offering advice. The
fee will consist of one of my three conditions for constructive
discussion being at least approximately satisfied.
