Well, of _course_ this one was in there...

So, let's delay the DOI. Say that after the last big dustup, France
gets to keep Canada - the British decide they would rather have an
extra sugar island or two rather than the &quot;acres of snow&quot;, and perhaps
some bright boy points out the value of a standing threat in keeping
the Colonists loyal.

And it does, for a bit. However, the various conflicts which led to
the Revolution OTL haven't gone away: the Colonists can see their tax
monies are at least in part paying for a defense against the French,
but it's only a matter of time befor they decide that they're strong
enough to protect themselves against the French and the Indians. All
this has done is buy a little more time for the British to find some
sort of accomodation between what the colonists want and their belief
in the authority and supremacy of the British parliament over the
Colonies.

Is the American revolution over-determined? I am aware there were some
ideas as to a revised relationship, such as the Albany Plan of 1754,
but given the fact that the Colonists were already generally more
lightly taxed and lightly governed [1] that British citizens in
England, is there any arrangement that the British are going to agree
to that the Colonists are going to find anything but insufficient, or
at best a stop-gap measure? Can a stable arrangement be found, or have
we at best delayed the revolution by 10-20 years? (Of course, a
*Revolution in 1796 has some interest of it's own...)

So really you are asking what would happen if the American Revolution
were delayed a couple of decades?  I think that if the French keep
their Canadian colony then the American colonies may enter into some
kind of Albany Plan.  With some kind of unity then the colonies
position vis-a-vis the British could be stronger- since the reason for
the Albany Plan was the French then the Plan would be military in
nature- perhaps providing the American Regiments to the British Army
or coming up with a plan where colonial militias would have a
permanent role in border defense.  The continuing French presence in
North America could also mean that the Settlement line is never
established, and since the British don't have Quebec the Quebec Act is
never passed.  Overall I think a French controlled Canada is good for
Anglo-American relations.
One of the big effects of the American Revolution was that the
French monarchy heaped even more debt upon itself, leading to the
Estates-General being called in 1789.  However, I think that there
would have been another round of Anglo-French wars before the end of
the 18th century, whether or not the Americans revolted, so I think
that you could have the French Revolution go off the same time.
Once the French Revolution starts I think that the American colonies
would become permanently connected to the British Empire.  My thinking
is that the once the French Revolution gets going it will follow
roughly the same path, that is get progressively more radical, with a
Reign of Terror. Once the French Revolutionaries commit Regicide and
start radical social engineering the French Revolution would lose
support in the American colonies- it would seem dangerous to just
about everyone in power.  The freeing of Haitian slaves will be feared
by the Southern aristocracy, and the French egalitarianism would
strike fear into the northern elite.  Plus French privateers would be
attacking American shipping as British shipping.  Americans would line
up behind the &quot;Patriot King&quot; George III and proudly defend British
Liberty against the French.

Why not just not have the document, but still have the Revolution?
Especially in the 20th Century the preamble has become more well known
than the main document.

So no DoI but still war, or the DoI doesn't have the 'When in the
Course of human events...' preamble and goes right to the grievances.

It is an obvious question why the DoI was needed, since Congress had already
declared the colonies independent on July 2, 1776.  For one possible answer,
see Daniel Boorstin, *The Americans:  The National Experience* (New York:
Vintage Books 1965), p. 379:

&quot;One explanation, given by Thomas McKean, a member of Congress from
Pennsylvania who had been present on July 4, was that the purpose of the
Declaration as finally signed was to provide a kind of public loyalty-oath, a
pledge of allegiance to the course already taken.  Or (as he put it), 'to
prevent traitors or spies from worming themselves among us.'  It seems to
have been decided for security's sake that 'no person should have a seat in
Congress during that year until he should have signed the declaration of
indepndence.'  If this was the case, the declaration was as much a loyalty-
oath as a declaration of principles.  And it was, then, one of the first, and
surely the best known and best reputed (as well as most misunderstood) of the
long line of Americans' efforts to reassure themselves by public oaths of
loyalty.&quot;

The Declaration is a major work of literature, but is now perceived to
have had no legal significance (though in the late 18th century many
states considered it to have either abolished slavery or to have mandated
states to abolish slavery).

If you are asking what if no independence (smarter Brits - George comes
over with a few leading Tories and Whigs, everyone sits down, and comes
out with prominent British Viceroy in Philadelphia and a recognition that
the Continental Congress is the American House of Commons), then you get a
timeline in which the British Empire will be incredibly stronger
(especially after it seizes Louisiana in 1815), and also one in which by
the end of the 19th century the North American parts of the Empire would
be of more importance than the European parts.

Chances are that any North American parliament will have jurisdiction only
over North America.

Chances are that with the advent of steam ships and reasonably fast travel
over the Atlantic you'll get a lot of interchange of people,  especially the
ruling classes.  You'll probably get some Americans sitting in Westminster.

On the other hand the American colonies would look much more like Canada
politically.

Dominion status would probably come earlier,  and I doubt anyone would want
to mess with the British Empire.  With America and India in it (plus all
that South American stuff that would almost certainly be taken over as Spain
falls to bits in the Americas) it's huge undertaking for anyone to even
consider having a go at.

Question...

Where would the capital be,  and what would it be called.  After all,  in
this reality Washington turned out to be a talented Militia colonel who
retired to his farming for the rest of his life.  I somehow can't see him as
an officer in 'John Company' busy expanding the Empire in India...

And of course the orders of chivalry.

In the later Empire there was the Imperial India Order.  I assume an

Knighthoods for senior and distinguished politicians and industrialists.

Loads of fun for all concerned,  and 'seats in the lords' means political

Ummm . . . Why?  OTL Canada's history and culture would look VERY
different from the ATL Anglo-American Empire's experience.

If the Americans stay in the Empire then so do all those leaders who
OTL were movers and shakers, and many of the underlying economic and
social trends that were present in the United States would be present
in the ATL American colonies.  So I think that a more &quot;American&quot; style
government in the American colonies would be much more likely to
emerge from this ATL then a Canadian style government.

in a similar thread recently the damage would still have been done as
far as an extreme lack of government suddenly giving way to Redcoats

You know, I started this out asking what Britain's chances of coming
up with a workable solution to the Problem Of The Colonies if they
were given a bit of a breather. People seem to be assuming &quot;well, of

Empire.

Well, _stronger_. I'd call a British Empire which in 1900 includes
OTL's US &quot;incredibly stronger&quot;: one that includes the US in 1815, not
so much. After all, the US in 1815 has only about half the population
of the UK and far less industry than that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where would the capital be,  and what would it be called.

Then there's the question of who gets to run the Empire as a
whole...once the North American territories surpass the UK in wealth
and population, there will be questions raised as to whether
Parliament should continue to sit in England or be moved to
America...either the more numerous Americans come to dominate the
central government, or, as in the &quot;For Want of A Nail&quot;, the North
Americans will willy-nilly become increasingly separate from an empire
they don't run and a central government too concerned with the affairs
of a little island far away. To revive the Canadian analogy, North
America will end up as Canada post WWII, only earlier...a nation
connected to the UK only sentimentally, by the symbolic bonds of the
Monarchy and, say, a Governor-General with no actual powers.

Some general thoughts on a Continued British America:

how long before the restrictions on immigration west of the
Appalachians are removed? Given how badly this pissed Americans, I'd
see this most likely as part of any general settlement of the Colonial-
UK relationship.

Although, as it has been pointed out earlier in this group, the
breakaway proved rather economically destructive in the short run,
would US industrialization proceed as fast as OTL in a free-trade
relationship with the world's first industrial power?

No US revolution, no French intervention, no French financial crisis,
no French Revolution As We Know It. However, the odds are we're going
to get another round of European wars, and that the French are going
to run out of money. Odds that the resulting blowup (say, a decade or
two later than OTL) actually gives us a working republic this
runthrough? A constitutional monarchy sans a bloody 26-year wait? A
Hereditary Dictatorship? Soviet Union Lite?

OTL the second and third Polish partitions happened while Messy Stuff
was happening in France. If the baloon hasn't gone up yet, any chance
they might intervene? If there's another Franco-Austrian war (everyone
pick their sides now) does Poland have any chance of things swinging
in their favor? (Although they're probably not getting Vitebesk back).

Quite possibly alt-revolutionary France doesn't extort Louisiana back
from Spain, reducing the chances that the British will find it
necessary to grab it. Still, British colonists will be arriving on the
banks of the Mississipi in large numbers by the 1800's: will there be
filibustering attempts? Will the British try to buy the area from
Spain?

Canada is seized from alt-revolutionary France in 1805, let's say.
With 45 more years of French ownership of the place, how many more
French-speakers are there than OTL 1805 Canada? Are they assimilable?
Are they shipped off en masse to Haiti (where the successful slave
rebellion has been butterflied away?) Spun off as a puppet state?
Shipped off to S. Africa, where they create a tyrannical regime which
will one day TERRORIZE THE WORLD?!

Spanish America: if alt-revolutionary France overruns Spain, the
colonies probably break away as OTL. (Spanish monarchy in exile in
Mexico, this turn of the wheel?). If not, how long before things fall
apart on their own, and how much aid and comfort do the British give
to the rebels ATL? California, Texas, New Mexico: do they end up
Mexican or British? (Odd notion: British Texas (part of British
Greater Louisiana), Mexican New Mexico, and California as a holdout
Spanish colony, more easily reached by the Spanish navy at sea than
Mexican rebels by land...and then, someone finds gold).

Slaves: if the American colonies have representatives in Parliament,
with the cotton planters adding their votes to the Caribbean sugar
planters, slavery has a much stronger voice in government than OTL.
How much is the abolition of slavery in the Empire delayed? And when
the South revolts in 1840 in response to Parliamentary plots to
undermine the Peculiar Institution, will any of the northern colonies
support them? Will the French Directorate, Britain's arch-rival, give
aid to the slave states, in hopes of weakening their over-mighty foe?

Native Americans: as screwed as OTL? Less so? More so? I'll note that
in Sobel's &quot;For Want of A Nail&quot;, they seemed to have had an even
bloodier time of it than OTL, although I don't remember why.

More long-term considerations:

The UK in the 19th century had a pretty crappy educational system,
while the US developed a first-rate free universal education (in the
midwest and NE, anyway). Does British America follow a path more like
OTL USA or Great Britain when it comes to a well-informed citizenry?

Canada, in spite of the opressive rule of the British Crown (:)},
managed to attract a lot of immigrants from all over OTL. Will British
North America therefore be as much of an immigrant-magnet as the OTL
US?

Will the mainly professional British army have much luck recruiting
among the wealthier Americans? Given that OTL the Colonists before the
revolution were generally more lightly taxed than people in England,
just how much is North America contributing to the Common Defense?
Will representation in Parliament make Americans willing to be taxed
at higher rates?

If British North America is part of an Empire which includes a large
chunk of Africa, do we see a larger Back-to-Africa movement? (Did he
jump or was he pushed?) Movement of blacks from the the OTL South to
the Caribbean?

Nobody may be willing to mess with the Empire (although as time goes
by, it may be harder and harder to convince people N. America will
jump when London says frog), but might this mean the Empire feels it
can stick with Splendid Isolation? Do they really care if Germany
beats up on France and Russia and grabs some Russian territory and
French colonies if the White Empire alone has more than twice the
population and three times the industrial power of Germany?

Having the French to the north would complicate things, but as I said
in a similar thread recently the damage would still have been done as
far as an extreme lack of government suddenly giving way to Redcoats
prodding their bayonets into our lives on a  daily basis.  The French

If the capital is fixed in the late 18th-early 19th century,
Philadelphia.  After that, New York.  No one, but no one is going to
suggest setting up shop in a swamp on the north bank of the Potomac...

Of course, there could be other considerations, after all in OTL,
Toronto isn't the capital of Canada.  The capital of *British North
America could be established elsewhere given political considerations.
That's what happened with establishing the capital of American North
America after all.

The reason that American industry ultimately achieved what it did was
due in large part to geography.  Pittsburgh's location makes it a
perfect steel town, Chicago's location makes it a perfect meat packing
town, I think that if you look at 19th century industrialization
geography played a large role, mainly in that if there was coal nearby
there was usually going to be industrialization.  So the lack of
tariffs could slow down American industrailization, but I think that
to a large degree its inevitable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

With a more direct interest in the American cotton trade and in
American political stability, I think that as outspoken as the London
abolitionists may have been, it would have probably have taken
something as equally catastrophic as the American Civil War to make
abolitionism official policy.  I could definitely see the American
South in this ATL revolting against the British, perhaps along with
the sugar islands?

Of course, everyone in the South knows that the American Rebellion was
not about slavery, it was about restoring Charles IV Stuart to the his
rightful place as the King of England.  The election of 1832 just
showed the intention of the William IV to usurp sacred American
Liberties with the appointment of that man as Prime Minister . . .

The British attempted to take Argentina in 1805.  I seen it presented
as their attempt to secure to the last major chokepoint in world that
they did not control, the Strait of Magellan.  With the American
colonies in the Empire and engaged against the French I have a feeling
they would succeed.  As for the rest of the Spanish Empire in America,
I think that there was a number of reasons that they didn't attempt to
take control in OTL, mainly the the fact that it was populated by half-
breed Papists (English view circa Napoleonic Wars)

If the Americans stay in the Empire, then I don't think that you would
have an &quot;American Dominion Act&quot; or something.  What is needed is some
way to integrate the settler colonies into the Empire.  Keeping French
Quebec out of the Empire really helps this TL, because then you've got
a British Empire that is basically only directly ruling over
&quot;Englishmen.&quot; Once the alt-French Revolution starts I think that you
would see the British seat Americans at Westminster.  The French
Revolutionary and then Napoleonic Wars were huge and bloody and very
expensive, and the wars would have an even more direct effect on the
American colonies then they did in OTL.  In the environment of this
long-term, total war against the French I think that the Americans
would have to start directly financially contributing to the Empire
and would be willing to, if the British gave them representation.
Thus the compromise is reached that the Americans will get x number of
seats in Commons, and in return for making the colonial assemblies
accept this agreement a few prominent Americans get titles that allow
them to sit in the House of Lords.

Do you think that the allure of getting to sit in Westminster and have
a direct say in the policy of the Empire would be enough for the
American elite to allow higher taxation at home?  I, for one, think
that it would, and the offer of Lordships would only sweeten the pot.
Jefferson and Hancock come to mind as two prominent revolutionaries
who, I think, would have made perfect candidates for this sort of
thing.  It is my impression that the Americans wanted desperately to
be thought of as equals by the English, because that is already how
they viewed themselves.  Given the chance I think they would go for
it, and the French Revolutionary Wars is the perfect environment for
the British to be willing to expand Westminster.  Ben Franklin could
even make a nice little quip, &quot;We English must think with one head, or
they will come off separately.&quot;

Yep. Sounds about right. But you forgot the part where it was actually
