I challenged Kantian Knucmo, as I have many other Kantians now at this
forum, to give an example of any idea, any concept, and or any theory
of man's knowledge which can not be directly linked to, or which can
not be reduced right back down to an irreducible and sensory level of
perception.

Kantian Knucmo has claimed, in his so called *refutation of Michael
Gordge's doctrine*, that space and time are two such examples of man's
concepts, used in the quest of man's knowledge, which are not directly
linked to, which are not derived from, which can not be reduced right
back down to an irreducible and sensory level of perception, he claims
space and time exist as concepts not linked directly to sensory
evidence / matter.

Now, given also that Kantian Knucmo likes to consider himself a bit of
a whizkid at things logical, he should therefore have no problem
explaining the meaning of both space and time without resorting to any
sensory evidence and examples.

His challenge is to explain *10 minutes ago* and to do so, without
resorting to any sensory evidence.

I think the opposite:

Having asserted that relativity theory is incompatible with Kant's
doctrine of the a priori, Einstein explains why, more generally, he
is not sympathetic with Kant:

This does not, at first, preclude one's holding at least to
the Kantian problematic, as, e.g., Cassirer has done. I am
even of the opinion that this standpoint can be rigorously
refuted by no development of natural science. For one will
always be able to say that critical philosophers have until
now erred in the establishment of the a priori elements, and
one will always be able to establish a system of a priori
elements that does not contradict a given physical system. Let
me briefly indicate why I do not find this standpoint natural.
A physical theory consists of the parts (elements) A, B, C, D,
that together constitute a logical whole which correctly
connects the pertinent experiments (sense experiences). Then
it tends to be the case that the aggregate of fewer than all
four elements, e.g., A, B, D, without C, no longer says
anything about these experiences, and just as well A, B, C
without D. One is then free to regard the aggregate of three
of these elements, e.g., A, B, C as a priori, and only D as
empirically conditioned. But what remains unsatisfactory in
this is always the arbitrariness in the choice of those
elements that one designates as a priori, entirely apart from
the fact that the theory could one day be replaced by another
that replaces certain of these elements (or all four) by
others. (Einstein 1924, 1688-1689)

Einstein's point seems to be that while one can always choose to
designate selected elements as a priori and, hence, non-empirical,
no principle determines which elements can be so designated, and
our ability thus to designate them derives from the fact that it
is only the totality of the elements that possesses empirical
content.

Simple: Experience or sensory perception is not possible without the
forms of space and time, which are known a priori.   It is a "necessary
representation" as Kant says, which underlies all intuitions (awareness
of an object).

They are not *justified* by sensory experience.  That is the thesis,
which refutes your doctrine.  They might even, I grant you, be derived
from sensory experience in order to understand them.  But that does not
justify them.

I have never claimed they are not linked to experience whatsoever,
either.  So cease with the straw men.  On the contrary, they are
necessary for experience.  They may be understood through experience.
But there is a difference between one's understanding something (which
is what you mean by reducing it back to experience) and being justified
in believing it.  Maths is a fine example: It is not knowledge of an
observational type, nor is it justified by observations.  Hence it
cannot be reduced back to an irreducible level of perception for any
other purposes than those of utility and understanding, but not
justification.

EXAMPLE: I seem to be having a memory, and memories seem logically to
require a time to happen in and a space to happen in. This seems to be
the best theory we can come up with and the strongest defensible
inductive conclusion. See, I have not resorted to sensory information
but to internal memories, but memories that probably formed 10 minutes
before as an interaction of self and it's space.

Back to 1771 for the immortal words of (Kant);

If we remove from our empirical concept of a body, one by one, every
feature in it which is [merely] empirical, the colour, the hardness or
softness, the weight, even the impenetrability, there still remains the
space which the body (now entirely vanished) occupied, and this cannot
be removed. Again, if we remove from our empirical concept of any
object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties which experience has
taught us, we yet cannot take away that property through which the
object is thought as substance or as inhering in a substance (although
this concept of substance is more determinate than that of an object in
general). Owing, therefore, to the necessity with which this concept of
substance forces itself upon us, we have no option save to admit that
it has its seat in our faculty of a priori knowledge.

Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any
experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come
within our perception, if the representation of time were not
presupposed as underlying them a priori. Only on the presupposition of
time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at
one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times
(successively).

Time is a necessary representation that underlies all [A31/P075]
intuitions. We cannot, in respect of appearances in general, remove
time itself, though we can quite well think time as void of
appearances. Time is, therefore, given a priori. In it alone is
actuality of appearances possible at all. Appearances may, one and all,
vanish; but time (as the universal condition of their possibility)
cannot itself be removed.

Time itself does not alter, but only something which is in time. The
concept of time thus presupposes the perception of something existing
and of the succession of its determinations; that is to say, it
presupposes experience.

http://www.bright.net/~jclarke/kant/index.html
http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html

http://www.4literature.net/Immanuel_Kant/Critique_of_Pure_Reason/

http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/kant/reason/ch01.htm

That space and time are only forms of sensible intuition, and so only
conditions of the existence of things as appearances; that, moreover,
we have no concepts of understanding, and consequently no elements for
the knowledge of things, save in so far as intuition can be given
corresponding to these concepts; and that we can therefore have no
knowledge of any object as thing in itself, but only in so far as it is
an object of sensible intuition, that is, an appearance...Thus it does
indeed follow that all possible speculative knowledge of reason is
limited to mere objects of experience. ...though We cannot know these
objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in position at least to
think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in
the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything
that appears.

On the contrary, that is precisely what you have done, the challenge
was, *to give an example of any idea, any concept, and or any theory of
man's knowledge which can not be directly linked to, or which can not
be reduced right back down to an irreducible and sensory level of
perception*, you replied space and time were two such concepts or
ideas.

I then asked you to define or explain the meaning of space and time,
you replied, they exist as something presupposed, FFS knucmo, the
mystics's god is a *presupposed* non-material non-sensory existent too.

Explain what difference is there, between, YOUR idea Kantian that,
space and time and math and one, do not need to be, are not directly
linked to, are not derived directly from evidence of sensory matter,
and the mystic's claim that god exists and doesn't need to be derived
from evidence of sensory matter.

i.e. I am asking you knucmo, to explain, what is the fundamental
difference between the Kantian epistemology of *presupposed concepts
such as space, time, math and the number one, which YOU (Kantians)
claim are NOT ultimately derived from sensory matter and or action, and
the mystic's faith based epistemology, of, accepting their idea of a
god existing without any direct link to sensory matter.

All your really claiming is that memories seem to need to be caused.
They seem to be generally caused by sensory imputs. But a dream might
be the cause of a particular memory or even the possibility that you
are a brain in a vat with wires connected to your brain causing the
memory formation. Although far fetched and unlikely with the evidence
we have, you are probably out of place by claiming that it is
"absolutely certain" that sense data always cause all memories.

But I like your theory that the content of dreams is generally from
sensory perceptions.

But that you know that you sensed is a grammatical affair and hence out
of the realm of just sensing. Here review the difference once again
please;

Distinguishing knowing that from knowing how

...in epistemology in general, the kind of knowledge usually discussed
is propositional knowledge, also known as "knowledge-that" as opposed
to "know-how".

To exemplify the distinction: in mathematics, there is knowing that 2 +
2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to count to 4. Or, one knows how
to ride a bicycle and one knows that a bicycle has two wheels.

The distinction is between theoretical reason and practical reason,
with epistemology being interested in knowledge of the theoretical
kind, not the practical kind.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

The distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge has
sometimes been expressed in terms of knowing-how and knowing-that,
respectively, or in terms of a corresponding distinction between
embodied knowledge and theoretical knowledge.

...[K]nowing-how or embodied knowledge is characteristic of the expert,
who acts, makes judgments, and so forth without explicitly reflecting
on the principles or rules involved. The expert works without having a
theory of his or her work; he or she just performs skillfully without
deliberation or focused attention.

...Knowing-that, by contrast, involves consciously accessible knowledge
that can be articulated and is characteristic of the person learning a
skill through explicit instruction, recitation of rules, attention to
his or her movements, etc. While such declarative knowledge may be
needed for the acquisition of skills, the argument goes, it no longer
becomes necessary for the practice of those skills once the novice
becomes an expert in exercising them, and indeed it does seem to be the
case that, as Polanyi argued, when we acquire a skill, we acquire a
corresponding understanding that defies articulation...

http://artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/tacitknowledge.html

One of the basic distinctions in epistemology ...is the distinction
between knowing that and knowing how. These are very different kinds of
knowing...

Knowing that is a relationship
between a person and a proposition;

this is the kind of knowing that has to do with content. So, for
example, we can know that a string is a null-terminated array of
characters in most C programs, but is an object in Java; we know that
Bush is president (not all knowledge makes one happy) or that Pedro
Martinez pitches for the Boston Red Sox. There is a lot of education
that is centered around expanding the set of things that we know that;
it is certainly the kind of thing that we are used to testing.

Knowing how is a different sort
of thing; it is the kind of
knowing that has to do with doing.

We know (most of us) how to walk; this doesn't require that we learn
the truth of a set of propositions. There are people who know the
physics of the way a baseball spinning interacts with the air to change
the nature of it's flight; this is a knowing that but is very different
than knowing how to throw a curve ball. In at least this last case,
society tends to reward those who know how more richly than those who
know that. But such is not always the case. We all know how to do many
things (healing a cut, recognize visual patterns) for which there is
hardly any knowing that.

The two kinds of knowing are entwined in interesting ways, especially
when it comes to education. When learning a new language, we begin by
accumulating vocabulary, grammar rules, and idioms (all instances of
knowing that) until, at some magic point, we know how to speak the
language. I have been told by a number of lawyers that the point of law
school is to get people to learn to think like lawyers; this is a
knowing how (and, perhaps, some violation of natural law).

Another way of viewing this distinction is by contrasting the content
of a field with the technique needed to be a practitioner in the field.
Some fields (history, physics) have lots and lots of content that needs
to be learned; others (law, mathematics, art, analytic philosophy) are
almost all technique. Just as there are different ways of knowing,
there are different ways of learning. To become an expert, you need to
learn the content of your field (the learning that) but you also need
to learn the techniques of your field (the learning how).

http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=10522

In normal conversation we use knowledge to mean:

Knowing that (facts and information)

Knowing how (the ability to do something)

Sometimes, we use the word knowledge to mean that we have some
information, we know that Mary drinks lemonade, for example. When we
have this type of knowledge then we are able to express it. I cannot
say that I know when the Battle of Hastings took place, if I cannot,
under any circumstances, say the date! This is not true of knowing how.

If I know how to swim, then when placed in the water I make certain
movements and do not sink! However, I may be unable to say how,
exactly, I am able to swim. Knowing how does not mean I know that ...
If I cannot say the date of the Battle of Hastings, I cannot be said to
know it. But if, while swimming, I cannot tell you exactly how I do it,
you cannot say I don't know how to swim!

Failing to understand the above can lead us into certain fallacies. If
we get instruction from the best public speaker  in the world, it does
not mean that because he or she can speak excellently, that they know
how to instruct others. They might be able to say what they do. For
example they might say how they practice. But this might work for them
and not for others! A much less able public speaker, or even one who
might never have spoken in public might be a much better teacher. The
point is that knowing that and knowing how are two different kinds of
knowledge!

In philosophy, knowing that something is the case implies that what is
known is true. Can we sensibly say that someone knows something, but it
isn't true? We cannot know that something is the case unless we are
able to show that it is also true.

I am an agnostic.  Nowhere in my argument do I draw strength from the
existence of any Being.  Another straw man to add to my collection of
yours.  They are becoming all too frequent.  Like I said, space and
time are necessary concepts for experience, and hence, are before
experience.  Experience would be impossible without them.  They are
not, empirical concepts, because no observation is truly a test of
them.  By that I mean, and notice the difference here Mike, that I
might not have been so clear on before: They are not justified by
sensory reality.  Sensory reality may cause the concepts to be formed.
And this might lead us to understand the concepts, as you yourself
rightly point out: But this does not justify our belief in the concepts
of space and time.  So in a sense, I agree with you, but not
necessarily so.  There is nothing demanding that we have to learn these
concepts from experience, just that we might.

You fail to see the distinction!  Yet again.  Ahh, I should be so

It is not impossible to imagine the world without space and time.  Go
on, try it.  You seem to think, as you write in a post to Immortality,
that we can live in a world without space!!  That my friend, is
paradigmatic of the mystical thinking, of which you are so keen to
impugn to others.  It is possible to imagine the world without God.  It
is logically possible, and is  not presupposed in any reality or
experience, save the mystics own imaginary reality.  Kant, quite
rightly affirms, that the mystics' intutions are mere opinion.

">

The mystic claims to see things which are not part of ordinary
experience, in other words, Gods and the like.  I am not claiming
anything of the sort, nor am I presupposing that there is a God that is
necessary for experience.  Leibniz et. al claimed that sort of thing,
as did Spinoza.  You might want to read these, as they form a
comparison with Kant, who disagreed with them both.  Kant,
incidentally, ruthlessly attacked Swedenborg, the Swedish Mystic, for
having "Dreams of a Visionary"!

There is nothing about space and time which is not part of ordinary
experience.  It *is* part of ordinary experience.  But it is also,
*necessary* for any kind of experience: Hence it precedes experience.
That is what is known as a priori knowledge.  The concepts of space and
time, Kant would say, could be learnt from sensory experience, in order
to obtain the concepts of space and time.  But it is not necessary that
they be learnt in that way.   This is what Kant means when he says
that:

"Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any
experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come
within our perception, if the representation of time were not
presupposed as underlying them a priori."

And he is right.  You couldn't justify the concept of time without
presupposing it.  And you wouldn't have sensory experience, were it not
for the representation of time applying with strict universality to any
kind of experience.  In order for us to be aware of an object, it has
to meet the conditions of space and time.  Thus, it has to be
presupposed in experience.  The mystic reckons, which is utterly
contrary to anything that I or the great Kant held, that he perceives
objects which are somehow immaterial, non-spatial, and atemporal, in
our experience, which is hogwash.  Anything we perceive must occupy
space, and be in time.  There is no *deeper* hidden reality to be
perceived independent of space and time, and what is real, is real.

minutes and time mean NOTHING to they have NO MEANING to a rock
stationary on the ground.

The standard of ALL of man's time is, one complete revolution of the

We often make up our own way to say things we know well and can support

Your are claiming that existence has only one definition. But you

definition or a common definition and if either can you show how they
are all identical.

--------------

The Problem of the Criterion

A general argument against the invocation of any standard for knowledge
has come to be known as "the problem of the criterion." As we have just
seen, there have been disputes about standards of knowledge. Some are
about particular kinds of arguments that provide evidence for knowledge
claims. As we will see shortly, others are about the degree of
evidential support or reliability required for knowledge. The
Pyrrhonian skeptics used an argument designed to instill doubt that any
such standard can be established.

Suppose there is a dispute about a standard of knowledge. If the
dispute is to be settled rationally, there must be some means for
settling it. It would do no good of each side simply to assert its
position without argument. So how would a standard of knowledge (or
"criterion of truth," in the language of the Stoics) be defended? It
could only be defended by reference to some standard or other. If the
standard under dispute is invoked, then the question has been begged.
If another standard is appealed to, the question arises again, to be
answered either by circular reasoning or by appeal to yet another
standard. So either the process of invoking standards does not
terminate, or it ends in circular reasoning, and in neither case would
the dispute be settled rationally.

Lehrer takes on the problem of criterion in the guise of the question
whether he can justify his acceptance of his own theory of
justification. He rejects the appeal to a higher-order theory of
justification as well as dogmatic acceptance of the theory (p. 228).
This leaves only circularity, or a "loop" of justification. Lehrer
defends the loop of justification as being virtuous.

It is nothing to do with meaning.  1 + 1 = 2 can mean anything to any
one.  That has absolutely no bearing on whether it is true or not, nor
does it prove that sensory reality "proves" that 1 + 1 = 2.  Just as
the concept of validity isn't literally tangible, neither are numbers.
You can provide your own examples to explain what 1 + 1 is, but that
does not justify that 1 + 1 = 2. Like I keep trying to tell you, there
is difference between understanding something, and being justified in
believing it.  Until you fail to understand this difference, there is
no progress to be made.  You shall just have to keep pounding your head
against the wall, conflating the difference.

Meaning is separate from truth.  1 + 1 = 2 is still true independent of
my observations.  Any sensible bloke will hold that.  I could be
deceived about the appearance of my laptop in front of me at the
moment, but I will still be having the thought that 1 + 1 = 2, and know
that it is true.  Are you trying to prove that sensory examples
mitigate against 1 + 1 = 2 or what?  If you are, you will find that a
failed enterprise.

See my other post for why space and time are not concepts that can be
learned from experience: They are presupposed in any experience.
Demanding a sensory example presupposes the very things you wish to
prove (space and time) and hence, you are rather begging the question.

evidence to show that God exists.  You don't need sensory evidence to
prove that space and time are there: For any of proving that space and

fail to grasp this.

I am willing to let the issue rest on the following explanation.  You

when you see the word "necessary", beg the question by presupposing
that all things must be garnered from perception and dismissing it when
not, whatever you like.  This is Usenet.  Only, proper, considered
philosophical discussion will be responded to

Space and time therefore seem to be necessary features of our
experience. Kant thinks there are other necessary conditions too: we
couldn't have experience unless things obeyed causal laws, for
instance. But these other requirements have to do with concepts rather
than with intuitions: things are given to us in space and time--we see
objects as spatio-temporal--but we think them as obeying causal laws.
(Remember Kant's claim that experience involves both intuitions and
the application of concepts.  Kant's discussion of what concepts we
need to employ in any possible experience is the subject of the
Transcendental Analytic.)
Because all awareness has to have spatio-temporal form, Kant says that
our knowledge of space and time is fundamentally intuitive, rather than
conceptual or intellectual--intuitive in the sense that it comes in at
the level of brute awareneness rather than at the level of logical
thinking.  Kant goes on to say that we are aware of space as a
particular thing, just as we're aware of the Eiffel Tower as a
particular thing; and likewise for time. Once we have awareness of
space and time we can apply concepts and reason about them (as we do in
geometry); but our basic knowledge of space and time is pre-conceptual.

Because we can be aware of an object only if it is presented to us in
spatio-temporal form, Kant calls space and time forms of intuition.

Pure intuitions

Kant calls space and time intuitions because they are given to us in
awareness:  we don't merely reason about them conceptually.  They are
pure intuitions because this awareness is independent of the particular
deliverances of experience. ('Pure' is roughly a word for a
priori.)
We know something a posteriori or empirically if our knowledge of it
depends on
what our experience is like.  E.g. we know what we know about cars
because our experience is a certain way. If our experience were
different, we'd know, or believe, something different about cars. So
what we know about cars is both a posteriori and contingent.
Our knowledge of space and time, Kant thinks, is not like this.  It
doesn't depend on what our experience is like. On the contrary: space
and time must exist, and be as they are, in order for us to have any
experience at all. All experience has to be spatio­temporal. So what
we know about space and time (as opposed to things in space and time)
is necessary, not contingent. Moreover, our knowledge of space and time
is not based on experience, for experience couldn't be different in a
way that would give us different knowledge of space and time. How
objects and events are distributed in space and time we can only
discover empirically, but the nature of space and time themselves can
only be known a priori.  Some of our intuitions have a vehicle form:
that is a contingent, a posteriori form of intuition.  But being
spatio-temporal is a pure (a priori) and necessary form of intuition...

Although space, time, and physical objects are mere appearances, Kant
insists that they are not illusions (B69f.).  They are 'objectively
real' because we couldn't possibly have any experience without
them.  If something is an illusion, Kant says, it is always possible to
be free of it and to see things as they are.  But it's not in any way
possible for us to 'get behind' the appearance of space and time
and perceive things as they really are--i.e., as neither spatial nor
temporal.
Kant puts this by saying that space, time, and physical objects are
empirically real, but
transcendentally ideal.  By 'empirically real' he means real, and
mind-independent, from the human standpoint.  They're real for us--as
real as anything can be.  They are the same for all of us,
scientifically observable, measurable, and necessary for experience.
There are hard facts about physical objects, which physics studies.
There's a difference, within space and time, between appearance and
reality: e.g. the moon can look near when it's really far away.  But
space, time, and physical objects are transcendentally ideal--ideal in
themselves--in that their existence depends on our perception of them.
(There are also things--Kant calls them 'things in themselves' that
are transcendentally real. Their existence and nature is completely
independent of us.  But we can know nothing about how these things are
in themselves.  All we can know of them is that they produce certain
intuitions in us.)

You miss the point totally.  The mystic claims evidence of transcendent
objects not seen in reality.  The Kantian does not.  His claims is that
space and time are necessary for any possible experience.  And it is
clear that he is right.

I notice you fail to distinguish between mind-dependent and
mind-independent.  A common error, easily remedied.  The forms of space
and time are empirically real, and mind-independent.  They are really
there, and are a hard fact about the world.  The mystic might be able
to claim, from his own subjective experience, that he sees a God in
front of him right now.  But that is an illusion.  Nowhere is Kant
saying that space and time are just a thing each of us decide to
invent: Physical objects have a verifiable location in space and time.

particular thing; and likewise for time. Once we have awareness of
space and time we can apply concepts and reason about them (as we do in
geometry); but our basic knowledge of space and time is pre-conceptual.

Because we can be aware of an object only if it is presented to us in
spatio-temporal form, Kant calls space and time forms of intuition.

Pure intuitions

Kant calls space and time intuitions because they are given to us in
awareness:  we don't merely reason about them conceptually.  They are
pure intuitions because this awareness is independent of the particular
deliverances of experience. ('Pure' is roughly a word for a
priori.)
We know something a posteriori or empirically if our knowledge of it
depends on
what our experience is like.  E.g. we know what we know about cars
because our experience is a certain way. If our experience were
different, we'd know, or believe, something different about cars. So
what we know about cars is both a posteriori and contingent.
Our knowledge of space and time, Kant thinks, is not like this.  It
doesn't depend on what our experience is like. On the contrary: space
and time must exist, and be as they are, in order for us to have any
experience at all. All experience has to be spatio­temporal. So what
we know about space and time (as opposed to things in space and time)
is necessary, not contingent. Moreover, our knowledge of space and time
is not based on experience, for experience couldn't be different in a
way that would give us different knowledge of space and time. How
objects and events are distributed in space and time we can only
discover empirically, but the nature of space and time themselves can
only be known a priori.  Some of our intuitions have a vehicle form:
that is a contingent, a posteriori form of intuition.  But being
spatio-temporal is a pure (a priori) and necessary form of intuition...

Although space, time, and physical objects are mere appearances, Kant
insists that they are not illusions (B69f.).  They are 'objectively
real' because we couldn't possibly have any experience without
them.  If something is an illusion, Kant says, it is always possible to
be free of it and to see things as they are.  But it's not in any way
possible for us to 'get behind' the appearance of space and time
and perceive things as they really are--i.e., as neither spatial nor
temporal.
Kant puts this by saying that space, time, and physical objects are
empirically real, but
transcendentally ideal.  By 'empirically real' he means real, and
mind-independent, from the human standpoint.  They're real for us--as
real as anything can be.  They are the same for all of us,
scientifically observable, measurable, and necessary for experience.
There are hard facts about physical objects, which physics studies.
There's a difference, within space and time, between appearance and
reality: e.g. the moon can look near when it's really far away.  But
space, time, and physical objects are transcendentally ideal--ideal in
themselves--in that their existence depends on our perception of them.
(There are also things--Kant calls them 'things in themselves' that
are transcendentally real. Their existence and nature is completely
independent of us.  But we can know nothing about how these things are
in themselves.  All we can know of them is that they produce certain
intuitions in us.)

You miss the point totally.  The mystic claims evidence of transcendent
objects not seen in reality.  The Kantian does not.  His claims is that
space and time are necessary for any possible experience.  And it is
clear that he is right.

I notice you fail to distinguish between mind-dependent and
mind-independent.  A common error, easily remedied.  The forms of space
and time are empirically real, and mind-independent.  They are really
there, and are a hard fact about the world.  The mystic might be able
to claim, from his own subjective experience, that he sees a God in
front of him right now.  But that is an illusion.  Nowhere is Kant
saying that space and time are just a thing each of us decide to
invent: Physical objects have a verifiable location in space and time.

God DOES exists as a concept in the mind of mystics, albeit as a
nonsensical concept which cant not exist in there (the mind) without
holding massive contradictions, of which there are NONE in reality,
(contradictions) therefore god is not real . e.g. nothing existed

3rd straw man fallacy from what I can count.  I have nothing in common

that does not detract from its truth.  There are truths of meaning and
meanings of truths.  The meaning of the truth 1 + 1 = 2, is just that:
1 add 1 equals 2.  It doesn't mean there's a divine sequencing of the
universe, just as 666 doesn't have any moral implications.  A mystic on
the other hand, would tell you that 666 is a divine number or whatever,
or that the existence of 1 indicates God's presence.

I remember that feeling in my gut called hunger. Hence a memory that
seems to be an activity of the brain which is internally stimulated and
implemented.

Hunger is a feeling experienced when the glycogen level of the liver
falls below a threshold, usually followed by a desire to eat. The
usually unpleasant feeling originates in the hypothalamus and is
released through receptors in the liver. An average nourished human can
survive about 50 days without food intake. [1] Hunger can also be
applied metaphorically to cravings of other sorts.

Physiology; Hunger is mediated by several molecular signaling pathways
in mammals. Hormones known to affect hunger include ghrelin, leptin,
and Peptide YY3-36 [2].

Satiety: A young girl experiencing the feeling of satiety after a
mealSatiety, or the feeling of fullness and disappearance of appetite
after a meal, is a process mediated by the ventromedial nucleus in the
hypothalamus. It is therefore the "satiety centre".

Various hormones, first of all cholecystokinin, have been implicated in
conveying the feeling of satiety to the brain. Leptin increases on
satiety, while ghrelin increases when the stomach is empty.

Therefore, satiety refers to the psychological feeling of "fullness" or
satisfaction rather than to the physical feeling of being engorged,
i.e. the feeling of physical fullness after eating a very large meal.

Satiety directly influences feelings of appetite that are generated in
the limbic system, and hunger that is controlled by neurohormones,
especially serotonin in the lateral hypothalamus.

According to Hume, our belief that events are causally related is a
custom or habit acquired by experience: having observed the regularity
with which events of particular sorts occur together, we form the
association of ideas that produces the habit of expecting the effect
whenever we experience the cause. But something is missing from this
account: we also believe that the cause somehow produces the effect.

In science, as with most conceptions, a theory is an explanation.
Evolution is a theory, just like gravitation. Gravity is not a law of
nature but an explaination of observations. If you drop something, it's
going to fall. That's an observation: unsupported things fall. But you
explain that observation with the theory of gravity, which is that the
mass of what whatever it is you dropped, a pencil or a pen or
something, is attracted by the mass...it's really a theory of gravity?
But remember, a theory is an explanation.

Actually you are mistaking the Strawmant fallacy with the "Burden
Shifting Fallacy," but I continue to have the right in most debating
course and venues of questioning any proposition or assertion you make.
You have not defended you assertion that existence has one meaning for
all, and as you know in debate, the one who asserts must at least be
ready to defend those assertions.

Scully: Your sister was abducted by aliens? Mulder, that's ridiculous!

Mulder: Well, until you can prove it didn't happen, you'll just have to
accept it as true.

The truth may be out there, but who has the job of producing it in an
argument? In the section on "Validity, Truth, and Soundess," we discuss
the concept of a burden of proof, which is defined there as "how much
each side of a dispute needs to prove in order to win someone's
agreement." Sometimes, however, whoever is carrying the heavier burden
attempts to shift that onus onto the other side--as Mulder does above.
In claiming that his sister was abducted by aliens, he carries a much
greater burden of proof, because we normally consider alien-abduction
stories as incredible; as a result, it is up to Mulder to produce proof
of his claim. But in the dialogue above, he shifts that burden to
Scully, creating the fallacious impression that, if Scully can't prove
it false, Mulder's alien-abduction story must be true. On the contrary,
since Mulder is making an incredible claim, it is up to him to support
it.

In easily verifiable claims, the person initiating the claim normally
assumes the burden of proof. Not doing so, however, should probably not
be considered a fallacy. The fallacy occurs whenever someone shifts the
burden of proof to avoid the difficulty of substantiating a claim which
would be very difficult to support.

Politician: My opponent believes that higher taxes are the only way to
pay for needed improvements. She never met a tax she didn't like. But I
have a better idea: let's cut waste in government first.

Why are politicians always so willing to tell you what the other side
thinks? One reason is that, in explaining someone else's views, we have
a chance to oversimplify and even falsify them. In the example above,
is it really likely that the opponent prefers raising taxes to cutting
waste in government? Probably, her position is much more complex than
that, and makes better sense. But in oversimplifying her position, this
politician makes it seem the choice between them is obvious. And that
is the purpose of this technique, which we call "straw man" (like a
scarecrow) because it relies on the creation of a false image of
someone else's statements, ideas, or beliefs.

A "straw man" is rarely based on actions, instead of comments or
beliefs. Usually actions are too unambiguous to suffer the
oversimplification of a "straw man," and simple mischaracterization is
not a fallacy, but a weakness in the support of a claim. For example,
claiming someone has voted for raising taxes, when the vote was really
in favor of a bill raising some taxes but cutting many more, would not
be a "straw man" in itself, but might be used in combination with
mistatements of the person's comments and policies to create a
false-image fallacy.

Politics provides lots of examples of the "straw man" fallacy, some
fairly subtle. In the 1988 vice-presidential debate between Dan Quayle
and Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle made the mistake of deflecting questions
about his youth and inexperience with the observation that John F.
Kennedy was even younger when he ran for president. Then Bentsen, in a
famous retort that was the most telling moment of the debate, said to
Quayle, "I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. And,
Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy." This proved to be an effective and
memorable remark--but did Quayle ever say he was a "Jack Kennedy"? Did
he really intend to compare himself to Kennedy, or was he using Kennedy
merely as an example that one's age doesn't necessarily determine one's
qualifications? Bentsen, obviously a consummate debater, was able to
create a false image of his opponent's remarks with the man still
standing there in front of a national television audience.

One person's account of the statements or views of another is not
always a case of a "straw man" fallacy. But you can judge such an
account in the same way you judge any authority or expert testimony: by
who that authority is, by the apparent accuracy of the account, and--in
the case of straw man--by the likelihood that the person being
discussed would agree, for the most part, with the description of his
or her statements or views.

But that's exactly what you've been saying as well:

"You see George, I've looked for, I've felt for, I've touched for and
I've listened for time everywhere and I just cant find time, I can see
clock's hands moving, I can see numbers on a clock change, I can feel
clocks, I can hear clocks, but that still doesn't tell me what the
clocks are actually doing, therefore this time thing MUST be a man made
concept."
"Time is NOT PHYSICAL, it is a mental concept / a construction / a
tool."
"Time does not exist."

So why are you disagreeing?

That's the metaphysics of time George, a totally different subject, I
am still waiting for you or any other silly Kantian to give the
epistemology of time, the meaning of time.

Your mission George, which no other Kantian chooses for obvious
reasons, is to replace time with its meaning, in this Kantian piffle:

"In respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to
experience, but begins with it."

Not quite, but very very close knucmo, well done, you still need to be
a little more precise, i.e. explain *what specific part* of the concept
that *space and time* are, because time is not always linked to space.

Although, its interesting indeed, that you found it impossible to
explain the *intellectual structures* (a Kantian wankphrase for
concept) of space and time without any link to matter of sensory
evidence /  existence.

But knucmo, my challenge to you was to name any concept, idea and or
theory of man's knowledge which can NOT be dircetly linked to, or which
can NOT be reduced right back down to an irreducible sensory level of
peception, you replied, space and time and now you are linking them
directly to sensory matter, indeed, unless you do they can have no
meaning in man's knowledge.

Its a phrase to remind you to check for and dump your contradictions.

e.g. The stupid and blatant contradiction contained within the first
paragraph of Kant's piffle on reason, re all of man's knowledge needs
experience except time, what trash.

Above you get very very close to defining time as the duration of
events, sequence events, comparing the intervals between such events
and compare the motion of objects, which very interestingly, means
that, contrary to Kant's piffle, there IS in fact sensory information
available for man's knowledge of the concept of time, therefore its not
*time* but rather its *the actual cause of time* MATTER IN MOTION,
***existence*** that ALL of man's knowledge is totally derived,
dependent and based from.

Good on you knucmo you're well on the way to being the very first
Kantian in the history of Kantianism to realise the complete crock of
shit that Kant's piffle on reason is actually based upon.

Specifically, consciousness before existence, e.g. he places the
concept of time before that which gives time its meaning.

Good on you Daniel T well done, time has no meaning to man at all,
without preceding existence of matter.

Time is a knowable relational concept, specifically it is the duration
of entities moving in relationship to each other, time is a tool of
man's knowledge.

Contrary to the Kantian crap, (found in the very first paragraph of his
appalling rant on reason) all of man's knowledge is NOT directly linked
to time, but rather, it is directly linked to sensory existence, (even
time) because if its not, then its *of the mind fucking piffle*
INVENTED IN MAN'S MIND, the sort of shit that ends up in jets being
slammed into sky-scrapers, man going to church and results in silly
people becoming brain dead fucking Kantians resulting directly in
fucking socialism.

If people want to understand the rational loathing of Kant, there it is
right there, found in Kant's first paragraph of his piffle about
reason, Kant's claim that; ALL of man's knowledge is based upon the
concept of time and NOT based on the non-contradicting identification
and integration of the perceptions of the *matter* (sensory evidence)
which gives rise to that concept.

I have some pure mathematics which derives spacetime.
In particular the time component is of interest because it is
unidirectional and is zero dimensional via the construction. This is
tantamount to the statement above of the nonexistence of time, yet
arithmetic can be done on this one-signed domain. We have no freedom to
travel ahead or backward in time as we have in the other components of
spacetime. The components of spacetime come via the natural
progression:
P1, P2, P3, ...
which has a natural product behavior breakpoint beyond P3. The full
development of this mathematics is at:
http://bandtechnology.com/PolySigned
Since I have not yet broken through to doing any physics on this
construction it satisfies the conditions that this thread asks for.
However the accuracy of this claim requires that physics would develop
atop this strange new mathematics. Otherwise it is merely a
conicidence. No other mathematical construction has yielded such a
result so I think it is likely that the polysign construction is
inherent to nature. The notions of continuous and discrete are married
here in a way that is compatible with old mathematics (real and complex
numbers) and yields higher dimensional spaces with proper algebraic
behavior. Yet that proper algebraic behavior denies the higher
dimensions a simplistic behavior that might be expected of them.

Dont be silly, they are not the same thing George, metaphysics is WHAT
we know, epistemology deals with HOW we know what we know, epistemology
is the theory.

e.g. I asked knucmo to explain what 12 means, he dropped context and

Nope, if there is no matter for the senses to identify without
contradiction, then there is nothing to know nor indeed to theorize or
to have any knowledge about George, well put it this way, if you try to
claim knowledge of something that doesn't exist in sensory reality as
matter of some sort, e.g. that all knowledge begins with time, then you
could end up in church, or becoming a silly Kantian.

All knowledge begins with time is metaphysically correct but a totally
useless bit of information in the quest of man's knowledge, that
Kantian statement tells us nothing of the theory or what is *meant* by
time.

There has to be something existing in sensory reality and in motion for
time to exist.

Existence precedes time and NOT the other way round, time is in the
universe the universe is not in time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I told you my meaning of the word long ago:  time is a relation between

If that is what you honestly believe then you would know that Kant is
away with the fairies to claim that man cant have any knowledge of
time, (because its a concept) which IS the axiom of his stupid
philosophy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Thats not true, I have said a zillion times and you refuse to
acknowledge it, that man can NOT have, nor can he make ANY claim of any
knowledge, including his ideas, theories, concept used to gain
knowledge, which can not be directly linked to, or which can not be
reduced right back down to an irreducible and sensory level of
perception.

Read again my first post and my challenge to knucmo or to any dopey
Kantian. Read my reply to that dopey fucked in the head commie
knuckle-dragging cunt Tim.

NOTE; knucmo could NOT explain space nor time without a direct link to
sensory facts.

Calm down, you're on the right track is all I'm saying, BTW there is a
HUGE difference between a *realist* and someone who is being
*objective* in their thinking.

I am saying that you are swaying more towards being objective thinking,
than being a realist in your thinking and for that you get my praise.

NOTE pragmatism for pragmatism's sake is evil, being pragmatic with a
