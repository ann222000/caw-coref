Well, now my Mom is in the hospital (she and my Dad live with me and they
both have Parkinson's). She was Coughing a lot (it started Tues.) Keep in
mind she has an Aide that takes care of her from 9am till 3pm. The aide
believed it was a cold never contacted the Nurse. My Mom even had a Physical
Therapist come to the house that day. He couldn't treat her because she had
been feeling ill. He too never reported it.
Well, tonight I called the Fire dept. to take her to the hospital as she
was having a real hard time catching her breath after exerting herself. Keep
in mind she had a fever this week also about 101.8.
Now the Dr. at the ER says she may have Heart failure or it could be
pneumonia but he doubts it.
I cannot believe the month I am having.
Thank you all for letting me vent as I am Pretty upset right now.
PLEASE SAY A PRAYER FOR MY MOM!!!!
Thank you ever so much and God Bless to all,
Dorothy in NY

Dorothy,

DON'T WAIT TO YELL AT THE EMPLOYERS of your Aide.  It is her/his job
to be you during the hours of 9-3.  If they can't do the simple job of
telling you "your mom is really sick and I think she needs to go to
the hospital" then I think it is your job to make sure he/she gets a
new job.  I don't care how good they have been in the past as they
dropped the ball BIG TIME this time.  Heart Failure isn't something
you want to fool around.  I'm sure your heart stopped (as your DH's)
when the doctor at the ER told you it is either pneumonia or
congestive heart failure.  I can (&amp; Larry) only hope it is pneumonia
and it is treatable.

Of course you have our prayers.  I miss you on the board but truly
understand.  Between your life, your kids, your DH and your Parents
your life is a little busy right now.

Take care of yourself and keep us abreast of what is going on.

xoxo
Kate

Dorothy,

I wish your mom a speedy recovery.  Make sure you report those
workers.  It is their responsiblity to know when your mom is sick and
needs medical attention.  Do not let this go. I will keep your mother
and you in my thoughts and prayers.
