Hello All,

I've been searching the web for a song we did in jazzercise last
week...can't get the song outta my head and i wanted to purchase it on
i-tunes but I don't know the name or artist. It's a standing leg
routine that starts out with extending your right leg (abducting?) to
the side and back while keeping all your weight on the left leg...and
it ends with a grueling set of squats (some of which are 'out and to
the right' and then a regular squat, etc). I know &quot;amazing&quot; and
&quot;goodbye&quot; are two prominent words in the song but I can't for the life
of me think of it. It's a newer routine (to me, anyway). Any help
ya'll have would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!!

Jessika,  I have gone over my notes to see if anything just jumps out
at me and it doesn't.  When you go to itunes, click on &quot;Music&quot;, scroll
to iMix, when the screen appears, type Jazzercise into the search
engine, click and all the imixes for Jazzercise will appear.  Go to
anything titled Jazzercise, Inc. with the R set listed on it.  Those
are our sets we buy for our classes.  Maybe by clicking on some of the
songs or the song titles will be helpful.  Other than doing that, I am
stumped as to what to tell you.  Hopefully, someone else can come up
with the title.  If not, maybe your instructor will remember.  At any
rate, my curiosity is piqued, please let me know what you find out.

Could it be &quot;Overdue Goodbye&quot; by Anastacia?  It has abducts and plies
like you describe, then ends with kind of a &quot;sumo&quot; move of bent leg
abducts and plies...

Leslie in OK (below) was correct...the song I was curious about was
&quot;Overdue Goodbye&quot; by Anastacia (love the routine, also).
It definately works out the gluts and quads till they burn!!!

Thanks so much for your info though...very helpful!! Didn't know that
all the songs were on itunes in those imixes. And I found lots of
other songs I like! :)

Thanks again!
