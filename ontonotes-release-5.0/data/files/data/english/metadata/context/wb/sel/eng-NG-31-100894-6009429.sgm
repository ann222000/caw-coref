&gt; &gt; It can be sensed, by man's senses, that pebbles and space can not each

&gt; &gt; there is pebble but NOT both.

&gt; &gt; However, it can ONLY be imagined, just like god, that both time and
&gt; &gt; space exist as dopey Kantian ideas, of the mind senseless meaningless

&gt; &gt; We have seen both George and Immortal, two of the most devout Kantians
&gt; &gt; here BOTH say that space and time exist only as man's imagination with

He's not saying that Kant said it, he's saying that you (and George)
said it.

That's nice to be able to copy and paste from the CPR. However,
the claim was that *Immortalist* (and George) have claimed such
and such, but your response is only a Kant quote. Therefore, it is
not a denial that you yourself claimed it, so it seems that you are
owning it.

Still, I don't believe you believe the bizarre claim that sensory
matter has no link to reality. Kant even said that this sensory
matter was the real, and your Kant interpretation doesn't stray
far from that idea. Kant explicitly linked sensory matter with the
real. And then, later on in the CPR, he explicitly linked the
noumenal with objective reality. There is no question that for Kant
it is sensation of something real, and moreover, objectively real.

It is, however, indeed George's claim (and he is not a Kantian
in any sense) that reality according to Kant springs from man's
imagination. But this is a preposterous interpretation which
flies in the face of everything Kant believed even in his
strongest rationalist days, pre-Critique. In fact, George even
wanted me to quote Kant stating that experienceI is objectively
real, but when I provided the quote he asked for (many of them,
actually), he conveniently ignored those he couldn't find excuses
to criticize.

If anything springs from man's imagination, it is even in Kant's
own view that imaginary entities possess in themselves a
formal manifold of their own, distinct from that of the real
in external appearance. Kant explicitly distinguished illusion
from appearance Â --

A49/B69 "When I say that the intuition of outer objects and the
self-intuition of the mind alike represent the objects and the
mind, in space and in time, as they affect our senses, that is,
as they appear, I do not mean to say that these objects are a
mere illusion. For in an appearance the objects, nay even the
properties that we ascribe to them, are always regarded as
something actually given."

Those who lie and resort to rhetoric in order to support
untenable positions such as George's should not be considered
devout Kantians in even the meekest sense.

&gt; If we remove from our empirical concept of a body, one by one, every

&gt; Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any

&gt; time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at
&gt; one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times

&gt; Time is a necessary representation that underlies all [A31/P075]

Oh so you've never read any Kant's C of R?

The question he asks, albeit as qualifying piffle, in the very first
paragraph, clearly states that Kant regarded there are no *objects* to
*awaken the mind to time*, which is WHY he says **In repect of time,
therefore, ....... .

He clearly re-establishes that position in the very first sentence of
the second paragraph. When he says, that it ".....does not follow that
all of man's knowledge comes from experience".

What YOU ought do is explain WHY Kant uses the mystics terminology of
*experience* and NOT the objective and rational term of *non-
contradictory identification and integration of the matter of the
perceptions of man's senses*.

He didn't because Kant says *there are no objects to awaken the mind
to time*, which means he wants you to have knowledge of time via
*imagining the experience of time* as an object-less experience.

If he said that he hasn't produced any evidence of it, and besides,
I'm prgmatic and may have changed my opinion on it, even if it were

Therfore, yea made big mistake, selling his mistaken "ignoratio"

The burden of proof is always on the person asserting something.
Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of Argumentum ad
Ignorantiam, is the logical fallacy of putting the burden of proof on
the person who denies or questions the assertion. The source of the
fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven
otherwise.

You commit this fallacy if you make a claim that needs justification,
then demand that the opponent justify the opposite of the claim.
Supposing that a proposition must be true because there is no proof
that it is false.

http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=529511
http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/Shifting_the_Burden_of_Proof

In a political dog-fight one participant may make an unfounded
accusation towards their rival and demand that the rival politican
show PROOF that they are innocent. In most countries the burden of
proof is on the person making the accusation but by shifting this
burden it implies guilt on their opponent.

The power of this tactic is often enhanced by reliance on the the
accusation being made by a credible third-party and the inability of
the accused to respond effectively by media dedalines. A slow response
- even if credible - is considered less newsworthy and often reported
within the frame of reference set by the original accusation.

As far as certainty, Kant would claim antinomy. But of course when if

Cutting in here, but I'm sure Immortalist won't mind anyway.

Kant is not talking about an actual body, but our *concept* of a body.
In this view, as with Rand's, a concept of a thing consists of every
possible attribute and relationship of that thing, known or unknown.

However, what is left over when you remove all those features is that
which is formal to the very concept of 'body' itself: space.

This, you should know, was an outright though implied attack on
Leibniz's noumenal theory of monads, existing in a spaceless, timeless
void and which therefore cannot relate to one another. Kant has
formally brought "space" back into the picture, and in one swift
stroke has not only brought "monads" back into relationship with one
another, but also, back into relationship with us. And since monads
were Leibniz's response to the Spinozist doctrine of 'God as
Substance,' his theory forms the "substance" of the discussion below,
albeit altered to suit Kant's Aesthetic requirements.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Kant's methodology differs severely from that of Leibniz. Notice that
Kant does not begin with Leibniz or Spinoza, or even Descartes -- he
begins with objects.

Substance, however, is not an imaginary thing, in that everyone does
have a concept of 'substance' and it forms a very important backdrop
for any "substantive" discussion. If your discussion concerns things
metaphysically considered, then the substance under discussion is that
which is required for their thinghood, it is metaphysical. In Kant's
realm the substance of the theory under the discussion is Aesthetic,
it considers things in their spatiality and temporality. Whatever
forms the substance of your discussion obviously lies a priori to that
discussion, and without which the discussion would not and could not
exist.

I've notice that in Objectivist circles (of which Dance has no part
but does have a certain strange fascination), they often refer to what
happens when they take Kant "literally." I will tell you what happens
when you take Kant literally from the Objectivist standpoint: you wind
up with a discussion about nothing: substance becomes imaginary,
appearance becomes illusion, discussion becomes fruitless, etc.
However, that is not a literal interpretation properly issued, it is
merely a reductio based on a Randian interpretation that has no
basis in reality. If you want to see a literalist interpretation of
Kant, consider the paragraph which I just composed above this
one. Yes, it is that simple.

&gt;Now, that's quite a bit less certain. Â I have no trouble imagining
&gt;taking away all the properties and relations of the body, and having
&gt;nothing there at all. Â I don't see why one would have to imagine a
&gt;substance.

&gt;&gt; Owing, therefore, to the necessity with which this
&gt;&gt; concept of substance forces itself upon us, we have no option save to
&gt;&gt; admit that it has its seat in our faculty of a priori knowledge.

&gt;Since I don't see any necessity for believing in 'substance,' I don't
&gt;recognize Kant's claim to /a priori/ knowledge here.

&gt;&gt; Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any
&gt;&gt; experience.

&gt;Yes, and Kant says exactly the same thing about space. Â The key word
&gt;here is 'empirical'. Â Kant's saying that space and time are things we
&gt;know /a priori/, as soon as we have our first experiences. Â As soon as
&gt;we understand space, we realize that all extended bodies are in
&gt;space. Â that's a universal judement that can't be justified
&gt;empirically (according to Hume); therefore, says Kant, since we know
&gt;it's true, it must be justified, and therefore must be justified Â /a
&gt;priori/. Â Similarly for time; as soon as we understand time, we
&gt;realize that all extended bodies exist in time. Â Since that can't be
&gt;justified empirically (again, according to Hume), Kant again argues
&gt;that since we know it's true, it must be justified, and therefore must
&gt;be justified /a priori./

&gt;It's a clever argument. Â But, of course, it doesn't apply to
&gt;'substance.' Â It's not certain knowledge that all extended bodies have
&gt;'substance.'

&gt;&gt; For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come
&gt;&gt; within our perception, if the representation of time were not
&gt;&gt; presupposed as underlying them a priori. Only on the presupposition of
&gt;&gt; time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at

&gt;&gt; corresponding to these concepts; and that we can therefore have no
&gt;&gt; knowledge of any object as thing in itself, but only in so far as it
&gt;&gt; is an object of sensible intuition, that is, an appearance...

&gt;All of those are questionable claims. Â just why does Kant think that
&gt;space and time are only conditions of 'appearances' or
&gt;representations, and not of the things represented?
&gt;And how does it follow, from the fact that the concept of 'appearance'
&gt;is distinct from that of 'thing in itself,' that we can never have any
&gt;knowledge of an object as thing in itself? Â That would not follow
&gt;except by a real difference between the appearance and the thing in
&gt;itself, and making a conceptual distinction does not show a real
&gt;difference. Â In fact, since Kant cannot show any differences at all
&gt;between the 'appearance' and the 'thing in itself' (because he has
&gt;ruled out any knowledge of the latter), Kant cannot deny that any and
&gt;all knowledge of 'appearance'
&gt;is knowledge of 'things in themselves.'

&gt;T&gt; hus it
&gt;&gt; does indeed follow that all possible speculative knowledge of reason
&gt;&gt; is limited to mere objects of experience.

&gt;Yes; though calling them 'objects of experience' does not settle the
&gt;question of whether those objects are things in the world, or only
&gt;'appearances' in human minds.

&gt;...though We cannot know
&gt;&gt; these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in position at
&gt;&gt; least to think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be
&gt;&gt; landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without
&gt;&gt; anything that appears.

&gt;Kant's compromise conclusion - that the things in themseles
&gt;indubitably do exist, but that humans can have no knowledge about them
&gt;- would seem to have somewhat of the same odd flavour. Â What in the
&gt;world would it mean, for example, to say that a child knew how to ride
&gt;a bicycle, yet could never know whether he was sitting on a bicycle or
&gt;not?

&gt;'removed' the monads by imagining them away.
">

All you're saying is that he doesn't use the term 'monad.' However,
Kant refers to Leibniz at A44/B62, and it is well-known among Kant
scholars the Kant was addressing Leibniz, Wolff, and Newton in the
Aesthetic concerning their respective views on Space. Furthermore,
Kant uses the term 'monad' and its variants ten times throughout the
Critique. For example, at B322: "For this reason Leibniz, regarding
substances as noumena, took away from them, by the manner in
which he conceived them, whatever might signify outer
relation, including also, therefore, composition, and so made
them all, even the constituents of matter, simple subjects with
powers of representation -- in a word, MONADS." (Emphasis in
original.)

Things become much clearer when you can relate this discussion
back to the philosophers Kant was addressing. As you can see, Kant
is explaining here that Leibniz applied the same type of analysis to
an object. I shall prove this by comparison of the two passages.

Kant -- "If we remove from our empirical concept of a body, one by
one, every feature in it which is [merely] empirical, the colour, the
hardness or softness, the weight, even the impenetrability, there
still remains the space which the body (now entirely vanished)
occupied, and this cannot be removed."

Leibniz -- "Leibniz, regarding substances as noumena, took away
from them, by the manner in which he conceived them, whatever might
signify outer relation, including also, therefore, composition, and so
made them all, even the constituents of matter, simple subjects with
powers of representation -- in a word, MONADS."

For Kant, the only subject with powers of representation is the
perceiving subject. And so as I said in my previous post, Kant has
performed a reversal on Leibniz and related every "monad" back to
you the subject of perception. He has put "monads" not only back
in relationship with each other, but in one stroke he has done this
through the subject, you. It is the formal concept of Space that
solves the problem of monads, which was Leibniz's solution to the
problem of substances, the same substances which Kant mentioned
in the very paragraph following and which you trounced as
non-existent.

Thanks to Kant, humans are once again part of this metaphysical
relationship, and the substance of the object is whatever you put into
it, spatially and temporally as empirical forms of appearances.

However, I'm not talking about the literature, I am only taking Kant
very literally as the Objectivists do. Interpreting Kant in
traditionalist terms is a huge blunder. Even you have said that Kant
has gone against the concept of "objectivity," and if you still
believe that, then you should also believe that he has Criticized many
other philosophical concepts, and that this process hasn't stopped
with just that one.

However, as I have quoted for you before, the Schematism provides for
the objectivity of appearances through the concepts of understanding
applied through time. Thus, when we reach the section on Schematism,
they are no longer appearances, they have been upgraded to the level
of objects possessing objective reality.

These first two sections of the Critique (everything preceding the
Dialectic, that is) need to be seen as a theoretical progression of a
thing in experience from "mere appearance" to "empirical object."
It is a huge error therefore to stop at the Aesthetic and declare that
Kant is leveling some criticism at our ability to perceive objects.
This book is a progression, and more, it is a form of developmental
progression from discussing sense in its most general (the Expositions
on Space and Time) to our ability to form concepts of experience
(Analytic of Principles and Analytic of Judgment).

">

You've misunderstood Kant's general thrust which is to enact a
reversal on many of these traditional concepts such as 'substance.'
B183 - "The schema of substance is permanence of the real in time."
B207 - "In all appearances, the real that is an object of sensation
has intensive magnitude, that is, a degree."

Thus, the real is an object of sensation, and is the permanent
substance. The substance of metaphysics is all possible sensible
reality, that is, they are related back to our ability to relate to
the world (that is the purpose of transcendental logic in a nutshell),
they are not Leibniz's 'monads in the clouds' out of all relationship
to human perception, human reality, and human affairs.

The solution to the problem of universals (which is what the
Schematism amounts to) is a human one, because the problem of
universals itself points out the conceptual and perceptual limitations
of humans. And the most basic limitation we place is that of space and
time.

&gt;&gt; real, but when I provided the quote he asked for (many of them,
&gt;&gt; actually), he conveniently ignored those he couldn't find excuses
&gt;&gt; to criticize.

&gt;You provided one quote where Kant said that his mental Categories -
&gt;the 'forms of' something or other - were 'objectively real', but
&gt;snipped so that you could pretend it was an assertion about
&gt;'experience' instead. Â You also forgot to mention that 'objectively
&gt;real' was equivocal; since by 'objective reality' Kant means only
&gt;&quot;significance and truth&quot; (neither of which are 'objective' in the
&gt;sense of mind-independence; Kant uses the words 'noumena' and
&gt;'noumenal' instead for mind-independent existents.)
">

Oh I see now. You want to think about the world that doesn't pertain
to experience, ponder existence as a mental construct without deigning
to contact it through the senses, you want mind-independent knowledge
which would be conceivable only if you could blow out your brains and
somehow still be able to think.

Thankfully however, "objective" does not mean mind-independent.
Allow me to give a scientific example of what this term means. If
you stick your finger in a cup of water in an attempt to estimate its
temperature, that method is subjective; however, if you put a
thermometer in the cup of water, that method is objective.

This is all Kant means by the term, and anything else you may conjure
up about it, whether real or imaginary, has nothing to do with Kant's
intent.

Now in order for the real world (including cups of water) to be
considered objective, it must be conformable to such objective
procedures as using a thermometer to measure temperature. And it
must do so a priori, that is, with universal and apodictic necessity,
to any possible objective judgment.

We understand, a priori to the actual measurement, that the result
will be objective. In the Deduction, Kant explains HOW WE KNOW
THIS a priori to the fact by proving its objectivity. He begins by
trying to determine which concepts (categories) lie at the very heart
of such investigations (and in this process he finds some help in
Aristotle). These are the fundamental categories upon which all other
concepts depend. Then he takes the result, those categories considered
most basic or primary, and places them in an orderly table of logical
judgments, thus systematizing them (criticizing Aristotle along the
way for gathering these categories together haphazardly, and including
some derivative categories in his list).

Sigh... Here we go again, nothing but your blunt assertion with
nothing to back it up but an out-of-context quote.

Every time you say "world of physical objects," "nature," or something
like that, you have implied your own mental processes. You can't
get out of your own mind, so quit asking Kant for the impossible.
What Kant did explicitly say was that attempting to bypass the
transcendental distinction, as you have just done, is indeed the
source of a "compelling" fundamental illusion. And it is a "native
illusion" in that Reason in its pure employment is itself the source.
And this is not a perceptual illusion, as you claim, since in Kant's
system Reason is not a source of empirical knowledge, the latter would
be Understanding at work. Although Kant sometimes calls Reason the
faculty of Pure Understanding, this is obviously not intended to mean
empirical understanding because the empirical is not pure. Pure
understanding is Reason

Kant offers a solution to this native illusion in a section of the CPR
entitled "The Discipline of Pure Reason." And in this section is the
trick you need to learn in understanding Kantianism. "There is no need
of a critique of reason in its empirical Â employment, because in this
field its principles are always subject to the test of experience."
A711 B739

As you can see by that quote, Kant's concern is not with the empirical
objects around you, either as illusory or otherwise, his concern is
with metaphysical pursuits. As the quote above tells us, the Critique
of Pure Reason is not applicable to the field of empirical employment
because it is not necessary there. The question, or illusion, involves
metaphysics, they are questions found in the Dialectic such as those
involving God, or the beginning of the universe, and all other
questions which cannot be resolved through experience alone.

And indeed, Kant terms Pure Reason the "seat of transcendental
illusion," not the seat of empirical illusion (B355).

I have explained part of this to you before but as usual you weren't
listening.

I'm glad to see you are utilizing that great tool. But I hope you
understand that the "territory of pure understanding" is metaphysics,
and in Kant's day metaphysics involved questions not grounded in
experience, or as you would say, reality. Metaphysics is the stormy
sea of a substanceless quest for knowledge. So if your idea of
metaphysics as directly involving things around you comes from Rand
or some similar modern source, then your idea has pulled Kant's idea
out of historical context, because it is not the metaphysics of Kant's
day.

Science is nothing more than the knowledge gained from a study of the

Subjective is the mindless nonsenses spouting from the mouths of brain

any way linked to sensory evidence, observation or experiment, e.g.
the dopey Kantian saying things like, space cant be removed.

Or when the Kantian drones regurgiate their mindless crap about man's
knowledge being experienced in identical manner as the mystcis claim
their knowledge of a god is experienced.

No Kantian has ever been able to explain the difference, especially
when they regurgitate further mindless crap that, man's knowledge of
space and time are not derived from sensory matter or action of
existence.

Claiming such stupid nonsenses as space being

chaz says: space and time is **inborn knowledge** of even slugs and

Nature is the existence of things, in so far as it is determined

things in themselves, we could never know it either Ã  priori or Ã 
posteriori. Not Ã  priori, for how shall we know what applies to things
in themselves? since this can never be done by the dissection of our
conceptions (analytic propositions).[...] Â But Ã  posteriori such a
knowledge of the nature of things in themselves would be equally
impossible. For if experience is to teach me laws to which the
existence of things is subordinated, these must, in so far as they
concern things in themselves, of necessity also apply to them outside
my experience. Now experience teaches me, indeed, what exists and how
it exists, but never that it exists necessarily in such a manner and
no other. It can never, therefore, teach the nature of things in
themselves.

Loooook here you Kantian coward, dishonest little commie cunt, YOU
said that feeling for a temperature was being subjective and was not
being objective, because they were not using thermometers.

I pointed out that people were being objective, even about
temperature, long before thermometers came onto the scene.

I also said that some people do like to think that being scientific
meant being objective, however there's plenty of dopey Kantians, who
would regard the Kantian's piffle, which he calls epistemology, as
being scientifically determined, whereas in reality it is as
subjective as the mystic's epistemology giving rise to their god, i.e.
FAITH based idiotic evil dangerous fucking nonsense.

Kant was not a solipsist, that's what I'm saying. His Refutation of
Idealism is a direct attack on your interpretation of Kant's Critique.
If your interpretation is valid, then Kant would be attacking himself.
You need to check your premises.

I am not the one encountering contradictions in himself, you only
avoid contradictions by evading the facts, one of which being the
Refutation of Idealism. Kant included it in the B edition of the CPR
to deal with false interpreters such as yourself.

Ignore this also:

Bxl n. "However harmless idealism may be considered in respect
of the essential aims of metaphysics (though, in fact, it is not thus
harmless), it still remains a scandal to philosophy and to human
reason in general that the existence of things outside us (from which
we derive the whole material of knowledge, even for our inner sense)
must be accepted merely on faith, and that if anyone thinks good to
doubt their existence, we are unable to counter his doubts by any
satisfactory proof."

Idealism, Kant wrote, is a scandal to philosophy. And your false
interpretation of Kant is a similar scandal. It is scandalous to
accuse an anti-idealist of the very idealism he is criticizing.

(The interesting part about that quote from Bxl n. is in the last
three lines: if one is an empiricist, then the only proof satisfactory
to you would be an empirical one; yet that is exactly what the
idealist is doubting, and therefore the empiricist is unable to
satisfactorily counter the doubts of the idealist.)

&gt;&gt; Thankfully however, &quot;objective&quot; does not mean mind-independent.
&gt;&gt; Allow me to give a scientific example of what this term means. If
&gt;&gt; you stick your finger in a cup of water in an attempt to estimate its
&gt;&gt; temperature, that method is subjective; however, if you put a
&gt;&gt; thermometer in the cup of water, that method is objective.

&gt;Sticking your finger in a cup of water gives you information on a
&gt;fact: whether the water feels hot or not. Â That fact is completely
&gt;mind-dependent, or subjective: it feels hot iff the subject believes
&gt;that it feels hot. Â Sticking in a thermometer also gives you
&gt;information on a fact; wheher the mercury expands or contracts. Â That
&gt;fact is not mind-dependent like the other one: Â it is not true that
&gt;the thermometer reads x degrees iff the subject thinks it reads x
&gt;degrees.
">

That is exactly what I mean. And that perfectly corresponds with
Kant's meaning where he used his own example of the sun warming
the stone.

But I suspect you are disagreeing with Kant in that you believe
every aspect of information is, for him, mind-dependent. It is
mind-dependent, only in the sense that it requires a mind to make
that determination either subjective or objective. It's as simple as
that. And in fact, Kant uses the term "determine" and its variations,
with regard to the Critical philosophy, as many as 886 times in the
CPR (I'm not about to sort through all 886 in order to weed out the
ones that are not Critical applications of that term). "Determine" is
used fairly synonymously with the verb " to judge." Kant is explaining
how your mind makes judgments and determines facts objectively.

That is why I keep saying, if you want to eradicate Kantianism and
also maintain mind-independence of objective reality, then you'll have
to blow out your brains and still manage somehow to cogitate.

Yes, you certainly can, and nobody is denying you your ability, so I

I'm not sure what you're saying there, and I'm not sure that even you
know what you're trying to say there. If you're saying that we know
by experience that thermometers are objective tools for measuring
temperature, then all I can say is that Kant is definitely not ruling
out the practicality nature of experience when it comes to particular
things such as that. However, Hume did rule out experience applied
by itself when it comes to affirming apodictic necessity; and since
Hume was correct in that experience alone is not enough, this is the
problem that Kant is responding to by not dealing with experience at

"It feels warm" is a subjective statement, plain and simple.
Comparisons of skin temperature over time are not relevant and could
lead to wrong results. It is somewhat more objective, more scientific,

True. However, Kant goes beyond your assertion above, which is a mere
judgment of perception, in showing that the "realist" provides us with
no proof that the event has apodictic necessity. That is what Kant is
providing for you, whether you think you need it or not. The reason
you consider it apodictic is because you added onto the perception an
a priori rule, however dogmatically applied.

judgments of experience take their objective validity not from the

already said, never rests upon empirical, or, in short, sensuous
conditions[....] Â The object always remains unknown in itself; but
when by the concept of the understanding the connection of the
representations of the object, which are given to our sensibility, is
determined as universally valid, the object is determined by this
relation, and it is the judgment that is objective. &lt;/q&gt;

It also says in the 'scriptures':

B194: "If knowledge is to have objective reality, that is, to
relate to an object, and is to acquire meaning and significance
in respect to it, the object must be capable of being in some
manner given... That an object be given (if this expression be
taken, not as referring to some merely mediate process, but as
signifying immediate presentation in intuition), means simply
that the representation through which the object is thought
relates to actual or possible experience."

B197: "That there should be principles at all is entirely due
to the pure understanding. Not only is it the faculty of rules in
respect of that which happens, but is itself the source of principles
according to which everything that can be presented to us as
an object must conform to rules. For without such rules
appearances would never yield knowledge of an object
corresponding to them."

The doctrine of sensibility is not a critique on our ability to know
things, it is simply one step or stage on the way to providing
objective reality to knowledge, and to grounding all knowledge in
the forms of possible experience in general. If you want to believe
that Kant was a subjectivist, then you would do well to stick with the
first part of the book which deals only with subjective matters.
However, there is more to the CPR than you are willing to acknowledge,
and you must continually evade them in order to maintain your
untenable opinions about Kant.

Once again, you are criticizing Kant for demanding the application of
the senses, which would imply that you are requiring that knowledge be
gained without employing any senses at all.

If you say that an object is objective, that is a judgment, albeit
perhaps a judgment of perception (as when Kant states above, that it
rests only upon sensuous conditions). If you say it apodictically,
that is an objective judgment, resting both upon sensuous conditions
and conceptual ones.

There is no such things as an unconditioned judgment -- unless you
believe there are intuitive insights coming directly from God. All our
judgments are conditioned by sensibility and then by concepts, if they
are to be deemed objective, and these are called judgments of
experience. If not conditioned by concepts, but only by sensibility,
then they are subjective, and these are called judgments of
perception. Whenever you lay claim to the knowledge that the real
world is objective, you are making an apodictic judgment conditioned
by concepts of the understanding.

Ad verecundiam #3: no philosopher worth his salt would believe one
word you say about Kant.

There is nothing wrong with citing authority. It can be fallacious,
but it depends on the circumstance. If the context requires such
citation, than there is no fallacy. In your case, I think the context
pretty much demands it since, in all honesty, you are only screaming
'fire' in a crowded theater of people who know there isn't any fire.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You're both wrong. Â Repeating and comparing experiences leads only to

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sufficient, for objectivity.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now you're bringing intersubjectivity into this, further polluting my

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be, as Kant said, to &quot;append&quot; an a priori rule onto the perception,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thus converting it into experience.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Now you've 'polluted' the original topic; we were discussing &quot;objetive

Earlier in your post you quoted Kant disavowing any knowledge of
objects given in themselves, that is, unconditionedly, and now you
claim that judgments are merely reflections of objective reality. You
disagree with Kant while agreeing with him. Pitiful...

Reality doesn't spring from Imagination, your Kant interpretation is

Kant's C of R.

Or, lets read how you explain the difference, between the mystic's
idea that man's knowledge of god comes from an experience and YOUR
idea that man's knowledge of space is *a notion* and that will be as
subjective as it is possible for a human being to get. i.e. absolute

Subjective means to *whim* a position as true.

Objective means to *reason* a position as true.

Reason defined as nothing more complicated than, *man's only means of
knowledge, a faculty of man of non-contrardictory identification and
integration of the matter of his sense perceptions.

e.g. experimenting with items of sensory existence and finding the
pain and suffering or scalding your wrist from the intended baby's
milk, will cause pain and suffering or scald the baby's mouth, IS
reason at work absolutely NOTHING subjective at all.

It is subjective in that the mind can interpret the temperature
differently dependent upon circumstances, such as when the mother
rubs her wrist with ice just before applying the milk. A thermometer
is objective in that there is only one interpretation possible to
anybody because there are marks on the thermometer.

The issue here is not the thermometer. In a sense, the mother is using her
arm as a thermometer.

What is warm enough for her baby, might not be warm enough for mine. She may
not be aware, if feeding *my* baby, that *my* baby is hypersensitive to
temperature. She can not apply an objective test for the warmness of milk
relative to a babies ingestion habits using her arm, or a thermometer for
that matter.

Your both off the point here, as far as I can tell. To say "The milk is 360
Kelvin" is objective. To say "360 Kelvin is a good temperature for this or
that baby", not objective. Regardless of whether you use your arm,
thermometer or any other device.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Then your example was completely silly. Â Someone who'd never seen a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thermometer before would not know anything at all about the heat of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the water by using it, so would not have any 'objective knowledge' by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;your (and Kant's) definition. Â (However, as what happened to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;mercury would be mind-independent, it would still be objective by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;mine.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Silly or not, the example serves my purpose of defining subjectivity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by example.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;No, it did not, since your example was consistent with my definition
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;as well as yours. Â All your example did was, was let you pop in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;word 'scientific' as an /ad verecundiam/.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't care what you call it, there is nothing solipsistic about the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Critique.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I said nothing in the above about the Critique being 'solipsistic'.
&gt;&gt; &gt;But now that you bring it up: Â Kant's theory - that &quot;objective
&gt;&gt; &gt;reality&quot; is whatever one &quot;judges&quot; it to be - is fully compatible with
&gt;&gt; &gt;solipsism; the fact that Kant personally repudiates solipsism being
&gt;&gt; &gt;neither here nor there.

&gt;&gt; That's right, you have to claim that Kant *personally*, rather than
&gt;&gt; professionally or philosophically, repudiated solipsism.

&gt;Since Kant's 'profession' was a philosopher, those would be the same
&gt;thing.

&gt;&gt; Nice try.

&gt;&gt; However, if your judgment is to be objective you would be wise to take
&gt;&gt; heed of Kant's argument. Otherwise, all you have are judgments of
&gt;&gt; perception that do not ground any experience apodictically.

&gt;Indeed you don't. Â No judgement based on perception would be
&gt;&quot;necessarily true or logically certain.&quot; Â wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/

Yes, but the only way you can know this is with reference to that
which is necessarily true.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Since you've snipped Kant's definition of &quot;objective&quot; that I provided,
&gt;&gt; &gt;let me reinsert it here:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Sect. 19. Therefore objective validity and necessary universality
&gt;&gt; &gt;(for everybody) are equivalent terms, and though we do not know the
&gt;&gt; &gt;object in itself, yet when we consider a judgment as universal, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;also necessary, we understand it to have objective validity.[...]
&gt;&gt; &gt;judgments of experience take their objective validity not from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;immediate cognition of the object (which is impossible), but from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;condition of universal validity in empirical judgments, which, as
&gt;&gt; &gt;already said, never rests upon empirical, or, in short, sensuous
&gt;&gt; &gt;conditions[....] Â The object always remains unknown in itself; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;when by the concept of the understanding the connection of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;representations of the object, which are given to our sensibility, is
&gt;&gt; &gt;determined as universally valid, the object is determined by this
&gt;&gt; &gt;relation, and it is the judgment that is objective. &lt;/q&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20306/kant_materials/prole ...

&gt;&gt; Once again, you are criticizing Kant for demanding the application of
&gt;&gt; the senses

&gt;Not at all; I'm criticizeing him for claiming that judgements based on
&gt;'the senses' are &quot;necessarily true or logically certain&quot;
&gt;&lt;wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn&gt;, and his reasoning for doing so.

No, judgments of perception are not held by Kant to be necessarily
true until the application of concepts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; , which would imply that you are requiring that knowledge be
&gt;&gt; gained without employing any senses at all.

&gt;&gt; If you say that an object is objective, that is a judgment, albeit
&gt;&gt; perhaps a judgment of perception (as when Kant states above, that it
&gt;&gt; rests only upon sensuous conditions). If you say it apodictically,
&gt;&gt; that is an objective judgment, resting both upon sensuous conditions
&gt;&gt; and conceptual ones.

&gt;&gt; There is no such things as an unconditioned judgment -- unless you
&gt;&gt; believe there are intuitive insights coming directly from God. All our
&gt;&gt; judgments are conditioned by sensibility and then by concepts, if they
&gt;&gt; are to be deemed objective, and these are called judgments of
&gt;&gt; experience. If not conditioned by concepts, but only by sensibility,
&gt;&gt; then they are subjective, and these are called judgments of
&gt;&gt; perception.

&gt;So my judging that Â &quot;a trees can talk&quot; is 'objective' (ie,
&gt;&quot;necessarily true or logically certain&quot; because it was conditioned by
&gt;the concept of tree. Â Quite clear.
">

No, not the concept of 'tree,' but by a category, thus transforming
your perception into a categorical judgment. And in the example you
gave, the application of a category would be impossible. It won't even
qualify as a judgment of perception.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Whenever you lay claim to the knowledge that the real
&gt;&gt; world is objective, you are making an apodictic judgment conditioned
&gt;&gt; by concepts of the understanding.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Furthermore, you know that the mercury in the thermometer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is 'mind-independent' because you applied an objective a priori rule.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;No. realists believe that the mercury is 'mind-independent' because
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(with the possible exception of Uri Geller) no one can make mercury
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;exapand and contract merely by thinking about it - something that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anyone who wants, and has a thermometer, can experience for herself.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; True. However, Kant goes beyond your assertion above, which is a mere
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; judgment of perception, in showing that the &quot;realist&quot; provides us with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no proof that the event has apodictic necessity.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Realists do not assume *apodictic necessity;* they recognize that
&gt;&gt; &gt;their judgements are theoretical, and that any of their theories can
&gt;&gt; &gt;be wrong. Â They're content to leave infallibility to Kantians and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;Pope.

&gt;&gt; Is causality a law of nature or a scientific theory would may be
&gt;&gt; falsified?
&gt;The theory is that it's a law of nature. Â It's hard to think of an
&gt;experiment that would falsify 'causality'; usually it's assertions
&gt;that get falsified, not words.
">

The laws of nature are metaphysical theories, not scientific ones.
Usually its hypotheses that get falsified, when theories are falsified
you have a paradigm shift. And if the law of causality is falsified,
then you have evidence of miracles, i.e., it is metaphysical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Kant is proving more than the realist will allow. It is dogmatic to
&gt;&gt; claim that there is no apodictic necessity, particularly when that
&gt;&gt; statement itself is given as absolute.
&gt;No one is claiming that. Â What's claimed is that logic tracks the
&gt;world (and in logic, there are no apodictically certain categorical
&gt;statements; therefore...). Â Of course that can be falsified, by the
&gt;production of a counterexample (either from logic or empirically;
&gt;though, as you, Kant, and I all agree, the latter is impossible).
">

Kant is arguing that logic along with perception can do nothing more
than "track the world." However, with the addition of Categories,
logic can track it apodictically. That is not, however, to claim that
humans are infallible, since what Kant means by "tracking it" would
only include the most general sense of experiences. Our judgment can
certainly be wrong, but we know this of particular judgments only
because we possess apodictic certainty in general. Uncertainty is made
possible by certainty, necessity is not contradicted by human error.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That is what Kant is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; providing for you, whether you think you need it or not. The reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you consider it apodictic is because you added onto the perception an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a priori rule, however dogmatically applied.
&gt;&gt; &gt;So you're going to continue to tell me what I really thought? Â Sounds
&gt;&gt; &gt;like you've made your own 'apodictic' judgement about what I must have
&gt;&gt; &gt;thought.

&gt;&gt; If you don't believe there are laws of nature, and you don't WANT to
&gt;&gt; believe there are laws of nature, then you won't be likely to believe
&gt;&gt; Kant's argument which proves there are laws of nature.

&gt;I'm quite happy to believe that there are laws of nature. Â What I
&gt;don't do is consider any of my judgements to be laws of nature (which
&gt;has nothing to do with wants; I think it would be neat if every one of
&gt;my judgements was a law of nature).
">

I did not say that your judgments were laws of nature, I said they
were rendered objective upon the application of categories.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Good luck to you and your Humean comrades.
&gt;So now I'm a 'Humean Randroid' as well. Â Both Hume and Rand would have

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;objective reality.&quot; Â Capice?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's your problem, so take it up with dozens of doctors of
