Messages in this topic (1) 2a. TO BE CHANGED NEGATIVELY from the book Daily Overcoming Posted by: &quot;Nathaniel &amp; Margaret Williams&quot; nat@hal-pc.org natcmf Thu Nov 8, 2007 7:22 pm (PST) BlankNOVEMBER 8

TO BE CHANGED NEGATIVELY

“They changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.” – Psalm 106:20

How did they do this? It was with a change of mind, involving a change of Gods. We are ultimately to be changed into the same image as our God – man is to become “The image and glory of God.” (I Cor. 11:7). Now, if you change to ‘other gods,’ then whatever your god is, that is what you will become. On this occasion Israel forsook serving Jehovah, and made unto themselves a god in the image of a golden calf, an ox that eateth grass. Then to share the glory of their god, all they had was the glory of an ox – turning from the glory of the Creator, to take up with the fragmentary glory of the created.

This takes on vital meaning and application when we consider the creeds and doctrines which warp the minds of Christendom, so that in their mind they have the image of a God that is a despot, filled with wrath, vengeful, cruel, etc., and imputing to God all the base emotions of carnal man, no wonder there is no change in them, their god is as base as themselves. You cannot be redeemed, or changed, beyond whatever your God is. “We shall be LIKE HIM, for we shall see Him as He is,” (1 John 3:2). Many people have “Limited the Holy One of Israel,” and thus have limited their own glory and redemption.

“My people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit,” (Jer. 2:11). How did they do this? “They have forsaken Me, the Fountain of Living Waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.” The glory of the LIVING WATER was exchanged for the dubious glory of a broken cistern. Even if the cistern held water, it was not living water, but water that could stagnate, become corrupted. But being broken cisterns it lost even that water – left with an empty shell, all glory has departed. May God indeed turn us away from this negative realm, and change us into the glory of the heavenly, a process wrought through daily overcoming.

BLESSINGS FROM THE HEART
Pastor Cecil A. Thompson
November 9, 2007

&quot;GODLY COUNSEL!&quot;
Acts 28:26-27
&quot;Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?' Then I said, 'Here am I! Send me.' And He said, 'Go, and tell this people: Keep on hearing, but do not understand; Keep on seeing, but do not perceive. Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return and be healed.' ”

Several years ago a pastor friend of mine sent the cassette tape of a message that had real impact. It was a sermon by Dr. Charles Stanley on the dangers we face by listening to advice from the wrong sources. I have no intention of trying to duplicate what he said, (I would fail miserably), but I do want to focus on that very critical area.

Think about the times in your own experience when you ask for advice. It could be which car to buy, which dealer to select, what color to wear, what class to take, etc., but we all seem to be sort of sponges soaking up input from just about anybody that we bump into along our way.

It may seem to be harmless to ask for advice on the personal choices of our lives. We may want to seek counsel on career objectives from a variety of sources, including Christian vocational counselors. But when it comes to the area of our spiritual life, it is dangerous to get advice from the wrong sources.

We have people today who may be Christians, but who are not giving sound Christian counsel. We have Christian counselors who give counsel based upon worldly wisdom rather than the sure and certain foundation of the Word of God. They are Christian counselors but not giving Christian counsel.

I have been fascinated by a passage of Scripture in II Chronicles chapter 18. It is too long to type it all out for you. Please take the time to get your Bible and look up and read that entire chapter. Three main characters are presented here: Ahab (king of the northern kingdom - Israel), Jehoshaphat (king of the southern kingdom - Judah), and Micaiah, the faithful prophet of the Lord. Let me give you the condensed version of the story.

Ahab was the wicked king of the northern kingdom; his wife, Jezebel, was known for her wickedness and the one who had tried to kill Elijah. She and Ahab had a daughter named Athalia. Jezebel died but the wickedness continued.

Jehoshaphat was the righteous king of the southern kingdom. He had a son named Jehoram that he married to Ahab's daughter. We have no idea why this first conciliation between the two kingdoms should join righteousness and wickedness. Jehoshaphat went to Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, to visit Ahab. Ahab wanted Jehoshaphat to join him in fighting the Syrians to retake a town, Ramoth Gilead.

Are you still with me? Aren't you glad this is the condensed version?

Jehoshaphat asked if there was a prophet of the Lord that would let them know what God's will was in the matter. Ahab had killed almost all the prophets of the Lord and replaced them with pagan prophets who would tell him what he wanted to hear. Four hundred of these false prophets said that they should go into battle and victory would be theirs.

Jehoshaphat was still insistent that the Lord be heard in the matter. It was only then that Ahab admitted that there was still one prophet of the Lord, but he hated him because he always prophesied bad things. After prompting, Micaiah prophesied that he saw all of Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd.

You will have to read the chapter to see what happens!! (That is what we call salting the oats).

If the people you seek counsel from do not give you Godly counsel, reject it. If they do not go to the Lord in prayer and ask for Divine wisdom in giving you Godly counsel---run, don't walk. Get with someone who knows the God of the Bible and will take you by the hand and say to you about your situation: &quot;Thus saith the Lord!&quot;

In this day of fouled up morality and value systems, we need the unchangeable, unalterable Word of God to be our guide for life.

Let me pray for you. &quot;Father in heaven, I come to You in behalf of the person who is reading this right now. They feel alone and in need of Your touch in their life. Show them in some special way that you know all about the problem and if they will just trust themselves to Your care, You will care for them. Lord, please let them know that the answer they see is not just a coincidence, but Your tender touch. In Jesus Name I pray this. Amen!

Blessings dear hearts. Walk with God today, trust Him completely and be a blessing.

Messages in this topic (1) 4. ~Daily Inspirational ~ DEITY IN THE PERFECT HUMANITY OF OUR LORD JES Posted by: &quot;GraceNTheTruth2@Aol.Com&quot; GraceNTheTruth2@Aol.Com gracenthetruth Thu Nov 8, 2007 9:24 pm (PST)

DEITY IN THE PERFECT HUMANITY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
PART 1 OF 4
BY RUSSELL S. MILLER

Those who should know better are propagating a false doctrine that places
doubt on the Deity of Christ. They have now come to the erroneous conclu-
sion that our only Saviour, Jesus Christ, could have sinned! Mind you, He
didn't of course, but they say He could have! This doctrine is not only
erroneous, it is also heresy, and precious souls are being led astray.

Furthermore those who propagate such teachings plainly reveal that they do
not believe in the Deity of Jesus Christ; nor do they know, or understand, the
purpose of God in entering the stream of humanity through the Virgin Birth.

If Christ could have sinned then He was no different than the first Adam, and
His sacrifice was no better than the Mosaic system, and we are yet in our
sins! It is WE rather who inherited Adam's sin, and Adam's sinful nature, and not
the Lord Jesus. He was no sinner. Adam's sinful nature was NOT trans-ferred
to Him. There was none of Adam's sinful blood coursing through His veins. Thus
the purpose in the Virgin Birth of Christ is fulfilled. He lived the perfect
sinless life before the world. Consequently, at Calvary, He could take our
sin-that Adamic nature-upon Himself, and bear our sin on the cross. As Paul states
in II Corinthians 5:21, Christ was &quot;made sin for us&quot; at Calvary,
Christ, who &quot;knew no sin; THAT WE MIGHT BE MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN
HIM.&quot; But not only did the Lord Jesus take our sin upon Himself, Paul further
declares that &quot;CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS.&quot; He took our SINS upon Himself also,
when He died upon that cross. Thus in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians we read
these words concerning the Lord Jesus:

&quot;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace&quot; (Eph.1:7).

Plus, His resurrection from the dead is a clear declaration that there was
not one fraction of a possibility that our Lord Jesus Christ could have sinned.

In Hebrews 7:26 we read these words concerning the Lord Jesus Christ: &quot;For
such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners, and MADE HIGHER THAN THE HEAVENS&quot; (Heb.7:26).

It is therefore not a question of whether or not Christ could have
sinned-what a horrible thought! It is rather a fact that Jesus Christ WOULD NOT sin.
Lucifer rebelled, and sinned wickedly in departing from God to do evil and became
the Devil. Adam and Eve sinned, and plunged the whole human race into sin
(Rom.5:12). You and I sin! But Jesus Christ WOULD NOT sin. He &quot;set His face like
a flint&quot; to bear our sins on Calvary's cross (Isa. 50:7; Luke 9:51;
Heb.10:5-7).

Should this Inspirational be a blessing and encouragement to you, why not
send to a friend, coworker or, to your loved one who maybe defending the USA the
Word of God is so needed in our troubled world.  It is our heart at GRACE AND
THE TRUTH and mission to reach as many people as we possibly can TO SHARE with
them the Word of God and all that the Lord Jesus Christ has done for members
of the body of Christ.

gigie@cinci.rr.com &gt;
I am asking all of you to remember a cousin of mine, who has found out he
has something on one of his lungs, and the doctor is afraid it is cancer.
His name is, Jamie Parrish. They are going to do a biopsy on it, and when I
hear more, I will report it to you. His father passed away approx. 4 years
ago from lung cancer, and he knows what all his dad went through. The worst
part of this, is that Jamie does not know the Lord as his personal Savior,
so his soul is in very much need of prayer! If your churches have prayer
chains, please put him on it, for both soul saving and health. Thank you in
advance, and may God bless you.

Messages in this topic (38) 7. A WORD TO THE WEARY PROPHETS Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Fri Nov 9, 2007 12:32 am (PST)

August 17, 2007

Al Thomas:

&quot;A WORD TO WEARY PROPHETS--HOLD ON, THE FIRE IS COMING!&quot;

I was driven to prayer by the Holy Spirit--and it was urgent. A great burden came on me and I saw an open vision of many prophets from all over the world. Most were bruised and wounded men and women of God with their heads hanging low, almost ready to give in to defeat. Then from Heaven came an angel holding a large postcard, and it read: God Says: &quot;WEARY PROPHETS, HOLD ON AND DON'T QUIT....

&quot;Sometimes you've thundered My word and few have received it. Remember this, I was watching from Heaven, and I received it because I gave it to you (Isaiah 51:16). Often, you've trembled before My word was released from your mouth, not knowing if it would be accepted...but you spoke it anyway. There were those times when you wanted to throw in the towel, but you kept moving (Luke 9:62). Remember that even Elijah was depressed and wanted to quit (1 Kings 19:4). Do not think this is a strange thing happening (1 Peter 4:12). You're in good company! Like Jeremiah who could not contain the fire I put within Him (Jeremiah 20:9), you also allowed My flaming words to be released.

Some of you, as you moved along in the ministry I called you into, saw restrained but obvious frowns--even on the faces of your own family. Still, you served Me. Yes, still you obeyed My calling for your life. You've learned never to quit in spite of getting weary and sometimes, you had to encourage yourself (1 Samuel 30:6) when no one else would. I now encourage you--Heaven has taken note and angels are being dispatched to help you because you did not quit! You would rather die than not fulfill My will for your life. You remind Me of a man called, &quot;Paul&quot; (Acts 20:24). And his anointing will be upon you.&quot;

God Says: &quot;WEARY ONES, I'M PLEASED WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU GAVE MY WORD TO MANY HURTING ONES....

&quot;You've left some places wondering, 'What was that all about? Did anything happen?' Mighty servant of Mine, do not be mistaken--you did move in My 'Super'natural gifting, but after some meetings, you started to look in the natural, forgetting My Super. Much did take place in the Spirit (Zechariah 4:6). Many children of Mine who were hurting, received fresh manna because of your obedience to the prophetic ministry I called you to, and many left the meeting renewed and strengthened for the battle because you stepped out on the water and obeyed Me.

You were on the mark! The enemy of your soul attacked you viciously because you damaged his kingdom and he suffered loss, but for you, it was gain (Matthew 16:18). Some of you have eaten the bread of affliction, but I rejoiced because even when you were 'under it,' you gave healthy portions of the Bread of Life to My wounded ones (John 6:35). Thank you.&quot;

God Says: &quot;WEARY SERVANTS, REJECT THE CRITICISM, MANY IN HEAVEN ARE APPLAUDING....

&quot;Many of My prophets who receive My approval, often receive man's rejection. As a prophet, don't expect to be voted, 'Man or woman of the year.' Some of you have looked at your calling as being small and insignificant--you couldn't be more wrong. Many of you have not become well-known on earth, but in Heaven, your name is celebrated. You've given some words that sounded (to you) like tin...but they were actually gold to the ones who received them (Proverbs 15:23).

I put (My) goodness in your mouth for weary souls and you did not withhold it from those to whom it was due (Proverbs 3:27). Because of your obedience to proclaim My word (even though few noticed), walls of hopelessness fell away from some and others suddenly gained strength to answer their calling--all because you rejected the criticism of doubters and allowed yourself to be fueled by Heaven cheering you on (Hebrews 12:1). You didn't fire back at the pessimists; instead, you simply loved them and moved on with your mission.&quot;

God Says: &quot;SOME THINK THEY ARE APPROACHING THE SUNSET OF THEIR MINISTRY, THEY ARE WRONG....

&quot;A second wind is coming to refresh many (Psalm 147:18). Some prophets think they have 'missed it' and feel guilty. Yes, some have failed (2 Timothy 4:10), but many have been lied to (by satan), thinking that they failed Me when they have not! Your Holy Spirit inspired 'words' are producing changed lives, birthing divine destinies and encouraging many to keep fighting the good fight of faith. Some have thought nothing was gained and time was wasted, but you did not see My view. Never forget--I've called you to announce, pronounce and sometimes, denounce! From My perspective (and that's all that counts), you have spoken My words and stilled storms that raged in confused minds and hearts (Mark 4:39).

Instead of being weary, you will refresh the weary. Fire is coming. Many of your recipes say, 'add water,' and that is what I often do before I send My fire. I told Elijah to 'add water' three times before I sent the fire (1 Kings 18). At that time, there was a drought and water was precious, but Elijah knew the rains were coming. I've allowed some circumstances to 'throw water' on your ministry and life, so when I send the fire, you will know it was from Me! (1 Kings 18:41-46). Be weary no longer! Your ministry has Heaven's stamp of approval.&quot;

&quot;My Word that goes out of My mouth, shall not return void, but shall accomplish what I please,&quot; (Isaiah 55:11).

Messages in this topic (1) 8. GOD WILL PERFORM ALL HIS PROMISES Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Fri Nov 9, 2007 12:40 am (PST) There are SO MANY who FEAR today! THIS IS NEEDLESS!!! I will post some Scriptures I find VERY HELPFUL! These Scriptures ARE SO POWERFUL!! It is &quot;TIME&quot; to Re-New our Faith!!
We are &quot;Pressing-In&quot;...to the &quot;Days Ahead&quot;....

GOD WILL PERFORM ALL HIS PROMISES

&quot;Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations&quot; (Deuteronomy 7:9).
&quot;For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. Thy faithfulness is unto all generations. Thy word is true from the beginning&quot; (Psalm 119:89, 90, 160).
&quot;God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?&quot; (Numbers 23:19).
&quot;That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us&quot; (Hebrews 6:18).
&quot;The word of the LORD is tried&quot; (Psalm 18:30).
&quot;He is faithful that promised&quot; (Hebrews 10:23).
&quot;Thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth&quot; (Isaiah 25:1).
&quot;My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips&quot; (Psalm 89:34).
&quot;I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it&quot; (Isaiah 46:11).
&quot;He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations&quot; (Psalm 105:8).
&quot;Ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof&quot; (Joshua 23:14).
&quot;The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee&quot; (Isaiah 54:10).
&quot;If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself&quot; (2 Timothy 2:13).
&quot;The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness&quot; (2 Peter 3:9).
&quot;Being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform&quot; (Romans 4:21).
&quot;All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God&quot; (2 Corinthians 1:20).
&quot;In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began&quot; (Titus 1:2).
&quot;The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent&quot; (1 Samuel 15:29).
&quot;He will not forsake thee... nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them&quot; (Deuteronomy 4:31).
&quot;They that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee&quot; (Psalm 9:10).
&quot;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises&quot; (2 Peter 1:4).

“I WILL PERFORM IT”

The Word of God says:

Isaiah 59:17-21 For [the Lord] put on righteousness as a breastplate or coat of mail, and salvation as a helmet upon His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal [and furious divine jealousy] as a cloak. According as their deeds deserve, so will He repay wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; on the foreign islands and coastlands He will make compensation. So [as the result of the Messiah's intervention] they shall [reverently] fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him and put him to flight [for He will come like a rushing stream which the breath of the Lord drives]. He shall come as a Redeemer to Zion and to those in Jacob (Israel) who turn from transgression, says the Lord. As for Me, this is My covenant or league with them, says the Lord: My Spirit, Who is upon you [and
Who writes the law of God inwardly on the heart], and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouths of your [true, spiritual] children, or out of the mouths of your children's children, says the Lord, from henceforth and forever.

Psalm 66:1-3 MAKE A joyful noise unto God, all the earth; Sing forth the honor and glory of His name; make His praise glorious! Say to God, How awesome and fearfully glorious are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power shall Your enemies submit themselves to You [with feigned and reluctant obedience].

Jn 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. -

When you worship the Lord and call Him, He listens to your voice in the heavens. I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.(Ps 3:4). Jesus once went from Jericho. Then a multitude of people followed Him. Blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. When he heard Jesus was passing by, He wailed with a loud voice, Jesus son of David have mercy on me. Many people rebuked him not to shout. Though the multitude of people were following and closely packed around Him, Jesus heard his voice. He called him and healed him. After the birth of the son to Hagar, Sarah gave birth to Isaac through Abraham. When the boys grew up there was always clash between them. So Sarah told Abraham to drive away Hagar and her son out of the camp. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight
because of his son. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. (Gen 21:10-14). Hagar had a bottle of water which became empty. The child started crying for the water. There is no water in the wilderness. So Hagar cast the child under one of the shrubs. Hagar went away a far and sat and started crying. She was saying to herself that I will not witness my child dying. On the other hand the child was crying for water. God heard the cry of the child. nd God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of
God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. Gen 21:17-19.

You expect God to answer your cry, your prayers, and petitions. But many times you do not get replies. You come to conclusion that your situation is not known to God. Because of this you become tired. Beloved, God not only listens to your cry but before even you ask for it He knows what is to be done for you. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.( Ps 139:4). If you are godly and do thing according to His will, God promises to listen to you. The word of God tells us clearly how to be godly. And if you walk accordingly God will listen to you. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: (2Pet 2:9). Godly people will move away from sin. When God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha God saved only Lot and his family because of godliness of Lot. Sodom and Gomorrha were the city of sins. But Lot did not fall in to the pit of sins. On the contrary he was sad
looking at the sinful lives of the people of the two cities. And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) (2Pet 2:7-8). Godly people should control the tongue. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.(James 1:26). People who wish to be godly will face with many trials, sufferings and walk over it. Meditate upon the life of Job and you will understand how he faced and fought with great crises sufferings and pains and how could he over come such agonies. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: (2Tim 2:12).

Godly people will devote their lives in fasting, praying and will be generous to the poor. There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. Acts 10:1-

Are you godly? MONEY ANSWERS ALL THINGS

I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. - Ps 34:4

Well this devotional will be another one that I do not understand the reason for doing it, other than the fact that God told me to do so. To me it would seem this devotional would be to the Israelite people, where Orthodox or Messianic, and to be honest, I don't know if there are really any Israelite people that reads these devotionals. I do know that through the teachings of Jesus it could apply to Christian people as well. I will just have to see what God has me to share. Now we all know there were special covenants made between God and the Israelite people, there were promises of blessings based upon them keeping their covenant with Him, there were also promises of curses if they failed to keep their covenant. The same thing exist with those of the true Born Again Christian. Now let me share some verses of Scripture with you. Deu 15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this
day.
Deu 15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.
Does Israel reign over many Nations today, or does many Nations reign over Israel? I believe we all know the Answer to that. Almost every country reigns over Israel. Because the people of Israel, God's chosen people, have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord.
We know, from reading the Bible, and studying some Historical documents, how Israel lost their being recognized as a Nation. We know of the persecution they went through during WWI and how they were almost wiped out as a people, then in 1948 they once more became a recognized Nation. God continues to bless them as a Nation, even though they constantly break their covenant with God. Now as I am sure you all know, the Orthodox Jew, is still bound by the Laws. by their choice. To keep their covenant with God, they have to live by the Laws and the Commandments, No this does not give them Salvation. We all know that the only way of Salvation now, is through Jesus. Most of the Jewish men, especially those of the house of Levi, spends all of their time studying the Bible. They are supposed to be complete experts on the Torah and know everything it says, and how they are supposed to live. They are supposed to keep and teach the Torah to the Israelite people. I am led to ask
this question this morning. What are they studying, and what are they teaching.

Why is Israel, as a whole, not being blessed by God? Because they still are not keeping the Covenant, nor are they teaching it. Let us read some more now.
Deu 15:7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:
Deu 15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.
Now believe it or not, that poor person, can be living in any land today, the Levite or Priest as well. As we see by those Laws, the Levites, as well as the other Jewish people are suppose to help the poor out. Well my Jewish Friend, as I have shared with you in the past, has gone through the routes he is supposed to go through to try and get the help he needs, and from the source he is suppose to go through, yet they refuse to help. Now I ask, is that keeping the Covenant with God the way they are suppose to be doing. No it sure is not, all it is doing is making the rich get richer, while the poor is having to continue to suffer. Is it the poor persons fault? No it is not, it is the fault of the Priest that are supposed to be keeping and teaching the Laws God laid down to them. Now read the rest of the verses pertaining to this issue here.

Deu 15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

Deu 15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
Deu 15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
The Priest, no matter where he is at, has the responsibility of meeting the need of the poor. That was God's Law given to the Jewish people. Now the Jewish people, no matter where they are at, has the responsibility, based upon the Law to help the poor, and if any of these people are made aware of a poor person in need, especially if that poor person goes to them for help, and they fail to help that poor person, they are breaking the Law as well as their Covenant with God. Why is Israel still being persecuted? Because they are still breaking their covenant with God. What has this got to do with the Gentiles, nothing if they are still Gentiles, but if they have accepted Jesus as Lord and Saviour, then they are no longer Gentiles, but instead God's chosen people and as such the Laws of the poor still applies to the Priests, or Pastors of God's chosen people within their community, as well as the other Christian people that have more than enough, they are supposed to help
the poor. Once more people I am led to say - this is Bible - not some man made Doctrine. Remember what Jesus told the one rich boy, or man. Mat 19:21
Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
Mat 19:22
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. His possessions was more important to him than his salvation, this holds true with so many supposedly Christians today. They have more than enough, but they will not share it with those in need, they just want to keep it all for themselves. Is that what they are suppose to do? Is that what the Bible teaches? Is that what Jesus taught? I like something Paul had to say about all of this. 1Co 13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. He bestowed all of his wealth to feed the poor, he did it out of love for God's people, if he regretted it or did it to please someone else, it would not amount to anything, it had to be out of love for God and his fellow man. Jesus had something else to say about this. Mat 19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. Now I don't know about you but I believe that verse there has a very important message and some people need to be listening to what it is saying. Well I feel I have done as God has guided me. I do not know the purpose of this message, but God does. He has a purpose for it. If you know what it is about, then follow what God is telling you to do. Keep His Covenant with you. In His Love

The Lord's Judgement of Bankruptcy is coming upon this coveteous generation
Get ready for the insolvency crunch.

You have lived by the standards of your king, Omri, the decadent lifestyle of the family of Ahab.
Because you've slavishly followed their fashions, I'm forcing you into bankruptcy. Your way of life will be laughed at, a tasteless joke. Your lives will be derided as futile and fake.&quot; Attention! God calls out to the city! If you know what's good for you, you'll listen. So listen, all of you! This is serious business. &quot;Do you expect me to overlook obscene wealth you've piled up by cheating and fraud? Do you think I'll tolerate shady deals and shifty scheming?
I'm tired of the violent rich bullying their way with bluffs and lies. I'm fed up. Beginning now, you're finished. You'll pay for your sins down to your last cent.

Micah 5:10 And in that day, says the Lord, I will cut off your horses [on which you depend] from among you and will destroy your chariots. 11And I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds. 12And I will cut off witchcrafts and sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more soothsayers. 13Your carved images also I will cut off and your statues or pillars out of your midst, and you shall no more worship the work of your hands. 14And I will root out your Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] and I will destroy your cities [the seats of false worship]. 15And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance upon the nations which would not obey [vengeance such as they have not heard of before].

Micah 6 What God Is Looking For
1-2 Listen now, listen to God: &quot;Take your stand in court. If you have a complaint, tell the mountains; make your case to the hills. And now, Mountains, hear God's case; listen, Jury Earth For I am bringing charges against my people. I am building a case against Israel. 3-5&quot;Dear people, how have I done you wrong? Have I burdened you, worn you out? Answer! I delivered you from a bad life in Egypt; I paid a good price to get you out of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you— and Aaron and Miriam to boot!
Remember what Balak king of Moab tried to pull, and how Balaam son of Beor turned the tables on him. Remember all those stories about Shittim and Gilgal.
Keep all God's salvation stories fresh and present.&quot; 6-7How can I stand up before God and show proper respect to the high God?
Should I bring an armload of offerings topped off with yearling calves?
Would God be impressed with thousands of rams, with buckets and barrels of olive oil? Would he be moved if I sacrificed my firstborn child, my precious baby, to cancel my sin? 8But he's already made it plain how to live, what to do, what God is looking for in men and women.
It's quite simple: Do what is fair and just to your neighbor, be compassionate and loyal in your love, And don't take yourself too seriously— take God seriously. 9Attention! God calls out to the city! If you know what's good for you, you'll listen. So listen, all of you! This is serious business. 10-16&quot;Do you expect me to overlook obscene wealth you've piled up by cheating and fraud? Do you think I'll tolerate shady deals and shifty scheming?
I'm tired of the violent rich bullying their way with bluffs and lies. I'm fed up. Beginning now, you're finished. You'll pay for your sins down to your last cent.
No matter how much you get, it will never be enough hollow stomachs, empty hearts. No matter how hard you work, you'll have nothing to show for it bankrupt lives, wasted souls. You'll plant grass but never get a lawn. You'll make jelly but never spread it on your bread. You'll press apples but never drink the cider.

You have lived by the standards of your king, Omri, the decadent lifestyle of the family of Ahab.
Because you've slavishly followed their fashions, I'm forcing you into bankruptcy. Your way of life will be laughed at, a tasteless joke. Your lives will be derided as futile and fake.&quot;

Omri's evil influence was so pervasive and long-lasting that over 150 years later, the prophet Micah spoke of it in the present tense, saying, “For the [evil] statutes of Omri are kept ...”1
1 Kings 16:25-26 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him. For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
Omri was the first king of Israel to pay tribute to the Assyrians under their king Asurnacirpal III, in 876 BC. From the days of Shalmaneser II (860 BC) down to the time of Sargon (722 BC), Northern Israel was known to the Assyrians as &quot;the land of the house of Omri.&quot; On Shalmaneser's black obelisk, Jehu, who overthrew the dynasty of Omri, is called Ja'uaabal Chumri, &quot;Jehu son of Omri.&quot;
Omri entered into an alliance with the Phoenicians by the marriage of his son Ahab to Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians.

This may have been done as protection against the powers from the East, and as such would have seemed to be a wise political move, but it was one fraught with evil for Israel.
4. His Religious Influence and Death:
Although Omri laid the foundation of a strong kingdom, he failed to impart to it the vitalizing and rejuvenating force of a healthy spiritual religion. The testimony of 1 Ki 16:25,26, that he &quot;dealt wickedly above all that were before him,&quot; coupled with the reference to &quot;the statutes of Omri&quot; in

Mic 6:16, indicates that he may have had a share in substituting foreign religions for the worship of Yahweh, and therefore the unfavourable light in which he is regarded is justified. Upon his death, Omri was succeeded upon the throne by his son Ahab, to whom was left the task of shaking off the Syrian yoke, and who went beyond his father in making the Phoenician influence along with Baalism of prime importance in Israel, thus leading the nation into the paths that hastened its downfall.

Calvin, Commentary on Micah, Part 15
(... continued from part 14)

Lecture Ninety-fifth.

Micah 6:15
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but
shalt not drink wine.

The Prophet adds another kind of punishment, which was to
follow the calamity threatened in the last verse. He had said, that
those who escaped would at length be destroyed by the sword; he says
now, that the whole land would become a prey to enemies: and he took
his words from Moses; for it was usual with the prophets, when they
wished to secure greater authority to themselves, to quote literally
the curses contained in the Law, as in the present instance: see
Deut. 28 and Lev. 26. Now it is well known, that God denounced this
punishment, with others, on the people, - that when they sowed their
fields, another would reap, - that when they cultivated with great
labour their vineyards, others would become the vintagers. The
meaning is that whatever fruit the land produced, would come into
the hands of enemies, for all things would be exposed to plunder.
Now it is a very grievous thing, when we see not only our provisions
consumed by enemies, but also the fruit of our labour; which is the
same as though they were to drink our blood: for the labour of man
is often compared to blood, for labour occasions perspiration. It
now follows -

Micah 6:16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of
Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

Some read the words in the future tense, &quot;And they will observe
the statutes of Omri,&quot; &amp;c., and gather this meaning, - that the
Prophet now foresees by the Spirit, that the people would continue
so perverse in their sins, as to exclude every hope that they could
be reformed by any punishments. The meaning then would be, &quot;The Lord
has indeed determined to punish sharply and severely the wickedness
of this people; but they will not repent; they will nevertheless
remain stupid in their obstinacy, and go on in their superstitions,
which they have learned from the kings of Israel.&quot; There is however
another view, and one more generally approved and that is, - that
the Jews, having forsaken God, and despised his Law, had turned
aside to the superstitions of the kingdom of Israel. Hence he says,
that &quot;observed were the decrees of Omri, and every work of the house
of Ahab&quot;. Omri was the father of Ahab, who was made king by the
election of the soldiers, when Zimri, who had slain the king, was
rejected. When Omri bought Samaria, he built there a city; and to
secure honor to it, he added a temple; and hence idolatry increased.
Afterwards his son Ahab abandoned himself to every kind of
superstition. Thus matters became continually worse. Hence the
Prophet, by mentioning here king Omri and his posterity, (included
in the words, &quot;the house of Ahab&quot;) clearly means, that the Jews who
had purely worshipped God, at length degenerated, and were now
wholly unlike Israelites, as they had embraced all those
abominations which Omri and his son Ahab had devised. True religion
as yet prevailed in the tribe of Judah, though the kingdom of Israel
was become corrupt, and filthy superstitions had gained the
ascendancy: but in course of time the Jews became also implicated in
similar superstitions. Of this sin the Prophet now accuses them;
that is, that they made themselves associates with the Israelites:
&quot;Observed then are the edicts of Omri, and the whole work of the
house of Ahab&quot;: Ye walk, he says, (the future here means a continued
act, as often elsewhere,) &quot;ye walk in their counsels&quot;.
It must be observed, that the Prophet here uses respectable
terms, when he says that &quot;chukot&quot;, statutes or decrees, were
observed; and when he adds, &quot;the counsels&quot; of the kings of Israel:
but yet this is in no way stated as an excuse for them; for though
men may not only be pleased with, but also highly commend, their own
devices, yet the Lord abominates them all. The Prophet no doubt
designedly adopted these words, in order to show that those
pretenses were frivolous and of no account, which superstitious men
adduce, either to commend or to excuse their own inventions. They
ever refer to public authority, - &quot;This has been received by the
consent of all; that has been decreed; it is not the mistake of one
or two men; but the whole Church has so determined: and kings also
thus command; it would be a great sin not to show obedience to
them.&quot; Hence the Prophet, in order to show how puerile are such
excuses, says, &quot;I indeed allow that your superstitions are by you
honorably distinguished, for they are approved by the edicts of your
kings, and are received by the consent of the many, and they seem
not to have been inconsiderately and unadvisedly, but prudently
contrived, even by great men, who were become skillful through long
experience.&quot; But how much soever they might have boasted of their
statutes and counsels, and however plausibly they might have
referred to prudence and power in order to disguise their
idolatries, yet all those things were of no account before God. By
counsels, the Prophet no doubt meant that false kind of wisdom which
always shines forth in the traditions of men; and by statutes, he
meant the kingly authority.
We hence see that it is a vain thing to color over what is
idolatrous, by alleging power on the one hand in its favor, and
wisdom on the other. - How so? Because God will not allow dishonor
to be done to him by such absurd things; but he commands us to
worship him according to what is prescribed in his Word.
And now a denunciation of punishment follows, &quot;That I should
deliver thee to desolation, and its inhabitants&quot;, &amp;c. There is a
change of person; the Prophet continually addresses the land, and
under that name, the people, - that I should then deliver thee to
exile, or desolation, and thine inhabitants to hissing. It is a
quotation from Moses: and by hissing he means the reproach and
mockery to which men in a miserable state are exposed.
At last he adds, &quot;Ye shall bear the reproach of my people&quot;.
Some take the word, people, in a good sense, as though the Prophet
had said here, that God will punish the wrongs which the rich had
done to the distressed common people; but this view, in my judgment,
is too confined. Others understand this by the reproach of God's
people, - that nothing would be more reproachful to the Jews, than
that they had been the people of God; for it would redound to their
dishonour and disgrace, that they, who had been honored by such an
honorable name, were afterwards given up to so great miseries. But
the passage may be otherwise explained: we may understand by the
people of God the Israelites; as though the Prophet said, &quot;Do ye not
perceive how the Israelites have been treated? Were they not a part
of my people? They were descendants from the race of Abraham as well
as you; nor can you boast of a higher dignity: They were then equal
to you in the opinion of all; and yet this privilege did not hinder
my judgment, did not prevent me from visiting them as they
deserved.&quot; Such a view harmonizes with the passage: but there is, as
I think, something ironical in the expression, &quot;my people;&quot; as
though he said, &quot;The confidence, that ye have been hitherto my
people, hardens you: but this false and wicked boasting shall
increase your punishment; for I will not inflict on you an ordinary
punishment, as on heathens and strangers; but I shall punish your
wickedness much more severely; for it is necessary, that your
punishment should bear proportion to my favor, which has been so
shamefully and basely despised by you.&quot; Hence, by the reproach of
God's people, I understand the heavier judgments, which were justly
prepared for all the ungodly, whom God had favored with such special
honor, as to regard them as his people: for the servant, who knew
his master's will, and did it not, was on that account more severely
corrected, Luke 12: 47. Let us now proceed -

Chapter 7.

Micah 7:1,2
Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as
the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my
soul desired the firstripe fruit.
The good [man] is perished out of the earth: and [there is] none
upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every
man his brother with a net.

The meaning of the first verse is somewhat doubtful: some refer
what the Prophet says to punishment; and others to the wickedness of
the people. The first think that the calamity, with which the Lord
had visited the sins of the people, is bewailed; as though the
Prophet looked on the disordered state of the whole land. But it may
be easily gathered from the second verse, that the Prophet speaks
here of the wickedness of the people, rather than of the punishment
already inflicted. I have therefore put the two verses together,
that the full meaning may be more evident to us.
&quot;Woe then to me!&quot; Why? &quot;I am become as gatherings&quot;. Too free,
or rather too licentious is this version, - &quot;I am become as one who
seeks to gather summer-fruits, and finds none;&quot; so that being
disappointed of his hope, he burns with desire. This cannot possibly
be considered as the rendering of the Prophet's words. There is
indeed some difficulty in the expressions: their import, however,
seems to be this, - that the land, which the Prophet undertakes here
to represent and personify, was like to a field, or a garden, or a
vineyard, that was empty. He therefore says, that the land was
stripped of all its fruit, as it is after harvest and the vintage.
So by &quot;gatherings&quot; we must understand the collected fruit. Some
understand the gleanings which remain, as when one leaves carelessly
a few clusters on the vines: and thus, they say, a few just men
remained alive on the land. But the former comparison harmonizes
better with the rest of the passage, and that is, that the land was
now stripped of all its fruit, as it is after the harvest and the
vintage. I am become then as the gatherings of summer, that is, as
in the summer, when the fruit has been already gathered; and as the
clusters of the vintage, that is when the vintage is over.
&quot;There is no cluster, he says to eat&quot;. The Prophet refers here
to the scarcity of good men; yea, he says that there were no longer
any righteous men living. For though God had ever preserved some
hidden seed, yet it might have been justly declared with regard to
the whole people, that they were like a field after gathering the
corn, or a vineyard after the vintage. Some residue, indeed, remains
in the field after harvest, but there are no ears of corn; and in
the vineyard some bunches remain, but they are empty; nothing
remains but leaves. Now this personification is very forcible when
the Prophet comes forth as though he represented the land itself;
for he speaks in his own name and person, &quot;Woe is to me, he says,
for I am like summer-gatherings!&quot; It was then the same thing, as
though he deplored his own nakedness and want, inasmuch as there
were not remaining any upright and righteous men.
In the second verse he expresses more clearly his mind,
&quot;Perished, he says, has the righteous from the land, and there is
none upright among men&quot;. Here now he does not personify the land. It
was indeed a forcible and an emphatic language, when he complained
at the beginning, that he groaned as though the land was ashamed of
its dearth: but the Prophet now performs the office of a teacher,
&quot;Perished, he says, has the righteous from the land; there is no one
upright among men; all lay in wait for blood; every one hunts his
brother as with a net&quot;. In this verse the Prophet briefly shows,
that all were full both of cruelty and perfidy, that there was no
care for justice; as though he said, &quot;In vain are good men sought
among this people; for they are all bloody, they are all frau
dulent.&quot; When he says, that they all did lay in wait for blood, he
no doubt intended to set forth their cruelty, as though he had said,
that they were thirsting for blood. But when he adds, that each did
lay in wait for their brethren, he alludes to their frauds or to
their perfidy.
We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet: and the manner
he adopts is more emphatical than if God, in his own name, had
pronounced the words: for, as men were fixed, and as though drowned,
in their own carelessness, the Prophet introduces here the land as
speaking, which accuses its own children, and confesses its own
guilt; yea, it anticipates God's judgment, and acknowledges itself
to be contaminated by its own inhabitants, so that nothing pure
remained in it. It follows -

Micah 7:3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh,
and the judge [asketh] for a reward; and the great [man], he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

This verse is properly addressed to the judges and governors of the people, and also to the rich, who oppressed the miserable common people, because they could not redeem themselves by rewards. The Prophet therefore complains, that corruptions so much prevailed in judgments, that the judges readily absolved the most wicked, provided they brought bribes. The sum of what is said then is, that
any thing might be done with impunity, for the judges were venal.
This is the Prophet's meaning.
But as interpreters differ, something shall be said as to the
import of the words. &quot;'Al hara' kapayim&quot;, &quot;For the evil of their
hands&quot; to do good. Some give this explanation, &quot;Though they are
openly wicked, yet they make pretenses, by which they cover their
wickedness:&quot; and the sense would be this,--that though they had cast
aside every care for what was right, they yet had become so hardened
in iniquity, that they wished to be deemed good and holy men; for in
a disordered state of things the wicked always show an iron front,
and would have silence to be observed respecting their shameful
deeds. Some interpreters therefore think that the Prophet here
complains, that there was now no difference between what was
honorable and base, right and wrong; for wicked men dared so to
disguise their iniquities, that they did not appear, or, that no one
ventured to say any thing against them. Do you, however, examine and
consider, whether what the Prophet says may be more fitly connected
together in this way, &quot;That they may do good for the wickedness of
their hands&quot;, that is, to excuse themselves for the wickedness of
their hands, they agree together; &quot;for the prince asks, the judge is
ready to receive a bribe.&quot; Thus, the rich saw that exemption might
have been got by them, for they had the price of redemption in their
hands: they indeed knew that the judges and princes could be
pacified, when they brought the price of corruption. And this is the
meaning which I approve, for it harmonizes best with the words of
the Prophet. At the same time, some give a different explanation of
the verb &quot;leheitiv&quot;, that is that they acted vigorously in their
wickedness: but this exposition is frigid. I therefore embrace the
one I have just stated, which is, - that corruptions so prevailed in
the administration of justice, that coverings were ready for all
crimes; for the governors and judges were lovers of money, and were
always ready to absolve the most guilty, but not without a reward.
For the wickedness then of their works, that they may do good, that
is, that they may obtain acquittance, the prince only asks; he
examines not the case, but only regards the hand; and the judge, he
says, judges for reward: the judges also were mercenary. They did
not sit to determine what was right and just; but as soon as they
were satisfied by bribes, they easily forgave all crimes; and thus
they turned vices into virtues; for they made no difference between
white and black, but according to the bribe received.
This view is consistent with what the Prophet immediately
subjoins, &quot;The great, he says, speaks of the wickedness of his soul,
even he&quot;. By the great, he does not mean the chief men, as some
incorrectly think, but he means the rich, who had money enough to
conciliate the judges. They then who could bring the price of
redemption, dared to boast openly of their wickedness: for so I
render the word &quot;hawat&quot;, as it cannot be suitable to translate it
here, corruption. Speak then of the wickedness of his soul does the
great; there was then nothing, neither fear nor shame, to restrain
the rich from doing wrong. - How so? For they knew that they had to
do with mercenary judges and could easily corrupt them. They hence
dared to speak of the wickedness of their soul: they did not cloak
their crimes, as it is the case when some fear of the Law prevails,
when justice is exercised: but as no difference was made between
good and evil, the most guilty boasted openly of his wickedness. And
the pronoun &quot;hu'&quot;, he himself, is also emphatical; and this has not
been observed by interpreters. He then himself speaks of the
wickedness of his soul; he did not wait until others accuse him of
doing wrong, but he shamelessly dared to glory in his crimes; for
impunity was certain, as he could close the mouth of the judges by
bringing a bribe. Speak then of the wickedness of his soul does he
himself.
And further, they fold zip wickedness; which means, that raging
cruelty prevailed, because the governors, and those who wished to
purchase liberty to sin, conspired together; as though they made
ropes, and thus rendered firm their wickedness. For the great man,
that is, the rich and the monied, agreed with the judge, and the
judge with him; and so there was a collusion between them. It hence
happened, that wickedness possessed, as it were, a tyrannical power;
for there was no remedy. We now apprehend the real design of the
Prophet, at least as far as I am able to discover. It now follows -

Micah 7:4 The best of them [is] as a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than
a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen [and] thy visitation cometh;
now shall be their perplexity.

The Prophet confirms what he had previously said, - that the
land was so full of every kind of wickedness, that they who were
deemed the best were yet thorns and briers, full of bitterness, or
very sharp to prick; as though he said, &quot;The best among them is a
thief; the most upright among them is a robber.&quot; We hence see, that
in these words he alludes to their accumulated sins, as though he
said, &quot;The condition of the people cannot be worse; for iniquity has
advanced to its extreme point: when any one seeks for a good or an
upright man, he only finds thorns and briers; that is, he is
instantly pricked.&quot; But if the best were then like thorns, what must
have been the remainder? We have already seen that the judges were
so corrupt that they abandoned themselves without feeling any shame
to any thing that was base. What then could have been said of them,
when the Prophet compares here the upright and the just to thorns;
yea, when he says, that they were rougher than briers? Though it is
an improper language to say, that the good and the upright among
them were like briers; for words are used contrary to their meaning,
as it is certain, that those who inhumanely pricked others were
neither good nor just: yet the meaning of the Prophet is in no way
obscure, - that there was then such license taken in wickedness,
that even those who retained in some measure the credit of being
upright were yet nothing better than briers and thorns. There is
then in the words what may be deemed a concession.
He then adds, &quot;The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation comes&quot;.
He here denounces the near judgment of God, generally on the people,
and especially on the rulers. But he begins with the first ranks and
says The day of thy watchmen; as though he said, &quot;Ruin now hangs
over thy governors, though they by no means expect it.&quot; Watchmen he
calls the Prophets, who, by their flatteries, deceived the people,
as well as their rulers: and he sets the Prophets in the front,
because they were the cause of the common ruin. He does not yet
exempt the body of the people from punishment; nay, he joins
together these two things, - the visitation of the whole people, and
the day of the watchmen.
And justly does he direct his discourse to these watchmen, who,
being blind, blinded all the rest; and who, being perverted, led
astray the whole people. This is the reason why the Prophet now, in
an especial manner, threatens them; but, as I have already said, the
people were not on this account to be excused. There may seem indeed
to have been here a fair pretence for extenuating their guilt: the
common people might have said that they had not been warned as they
ought to have been; nay, that they had been destroyed through
delusive falsehoods. And we see at this day that many make such a
pretence as this. But a defense of this kind is of no avail before ...
