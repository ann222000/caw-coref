From an interview of Senator Gravel's spokesperson Shawn Alexander
Colvin to the the newspaper Pravda.ru.

( http://english.pravda.ru/world/americas/13-06-2007/93280-senator_mike... )

Second question from the bottom:

===================
PRAVDA.RU: Can you imagine the former chess champion Bobby Fisher as the
leader of an opposition movement in the USA? Please substantiate your
answer.

COLVIN: Bobby Fischer would be pardoned. He deserves an apology for the
way he has been treated by the Bush administration.
===================

&quot;would be pardoned&quot; doesn't really make sense. I think he rather said or
meant to say &quot;should be pardoned&quot;. I wish more senators would raise the
issue.

ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From THIS CRAZY WORLD OF CHESS by GM Larry Evans (Cardoza Publishers,
">

$9.95) due to reach bookstores in September.)

Surprised by arriving to a tumultuous hero's welcome in Reykjavik,
Fischer told a midnight crowd that he plans to stay there. &quot;If the
people get
tired of me, they can take away my citizenship later,&quot; he said.
So far he has kept a low profile, but some observers are wondering
when he will bite the hand that freed him.

In a letter from congressman Christopher Shays to a constituent in
Connecticut in 2005, he stated:

&quot;I do not believe that the United States should stop their
pursuit and prosecution of Bobby Fischer. A warrant was issued
for his arrest but never served since he has never returned to
America. After his arrest in Japan he also accused President
Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi of conspiring
against him and said, 'They should be hanged.' The bottom
line is Mr. Fischer broke the law and should be returned to the
United States where he can be tried for the crimes of which
he is accused. However, earlier this year, Iceland's parliament
granted him asylum and citizenship for bringing attention and
honor to the country in 1972 for beating Spassky there.&quot;

I disagree. The interviewer seems quite aware of Fischer's views.

His questions, taken as a whole, seem to address the issue of Kasparov
leading an opposition movement in Russia while receiving some funding
from America.

I agree with Taylor on this one. Fischer could never lead. Loan wolves
never lead a pack, they just antagonize it. Fischer and Mohaned Slaon
are cut from similar cloth in that regard.

PRESIDENT CLINTON'S MEMOIRS

Excerpt from THIS CRAZY WORLD OF CHESS by GM Larry Evans.

3. Fischer Stalemated
February 14, 2005

It seems incredible, but Bobby Fischer languished in a Tokyo cell
for eight months without bail while Japan decided whether to deport
him
to America or Iceland, which had offered him asylum. His passport was
confiscated but the USA did not demand extradition because Japan
doesn't
regard his offense as criminal.

&quot;He's not a robber, he's not a killer, he's not a traitor. All he did
was
play chess,&quot; said his lawyer. So just what did Bobby actually do apart
from
yapping about the Jews and praising terrorists for 9/11?

A new book, Bobby Fischer, The Wandering King (Batsford, 2004)
based on a Dutch TV documentary, notes, &quot;Practising his art became
criminal because George Bush pére issued an executive order in 1992.&quot;

Fischer violated that order by playing a $5 million rematch with Boris
Spassky during a civil war in Yugoslavia. He was indicted by a Grand
Jury
13 years ago and faces 10 years in jail plus fines, the only person
ever
prosecuted for defying Bush's economic sanctions.

The book quotes former Chess Life editor Larry Parr, who said, &quot;The
issue is not whether Fischer broke a law (so have all of us) but
whether he is
a criminal as opposed to someone who has fallen afoul of the federal
regime.
Americans today are largely sold on the State as the new god, but in
19th
century England, juries often would not convict for minor theft
because the
punishment -hanging- was utterly disproportionate to the crime.&quot;

Canadian chess journalist Jonathan Berry observed, &quot;It has been
reported that President Clinton in his memoirs said the embargo was
ignored by all, even the USA government, and it was only enforced to
the
extent that arms were not sent to Serbia. Yet arms were sent with
impunity
to other factions, and other contacts with Serbia were okay. If true,
the
whole incident appears doubly pointless.&quot;

A reader replied, &quot;It's even worse than that. Serbia allegedly
received
missiles produced in the USA via Israel which makes it grotesquely
hypocritical to punish Fischer for his 30 games against Spassky.&quot;

Yes. Please bring it up because, if you do not, I intend to.

It has been reported that the reason Bill Goichberg does not want to
let Fischer back into the USCF is because Fischer is anti-Semitic.

It has also been reported that Goichberg objected to allowing Boris
Spassky to give a simultaneous chess exhibition in New Jersey because
Spassky is anti-Semitic.

However, I feel, and I think that most chess players agree, that a
chess player's political or social views should have no bearing on
whether they should be allowed to play chess.

Anyone can play.. however membership to an organization could and
should have some limitations. If it didn't you would have murderers
and child pronography pedophiles infiltrating the membership ranks. So
the question isn't if Fischer should be permitted to play chess( a
game he has abandoned) but rather should good people foot his bill to
belong to an organization for free?

In fact we have many such persons.

balderdash.

No one can tell a citizen of another country who they may have as a
house guest. And even if they could, they would not hold that against
the parents minor children who lived under their parents roof and
protection. The argument you propose simply isnt rational.

Their dues are subsidized. There is an organization that pays part of

That is not quite Pravda's point. It does not reference popular opinion. It

The Pravda journalist doesn't exactly grok that things are different here -
nor does he want to - 90% of the articles at Pravda comment negatively on
the US. This is nothing new [!]  [rofl!]

From the list offered above, there is no reason to resent citizen-Fischer

goverment's policy in order to hold citizenship. It would be an unpopular
measure to re-award him his citizenship, true, but no legal objection.

Fischer's crime, as the government see it, is a complex of non-tax payments
for income it claims he owes it following the 'war-zone'  playing of the
second Spassky match, combined with, as I understand it, risibly and
contentious comments on terroritst actions. The last of these are less
explicit, but post 9/11 it is not exactly a 'nothing' consideration today.

Fischer has expressed no desire to be affiliated with USCF as el Sloan
proposes, nor to return to the US. What el Sloan thinks he is up to is
thereby naught to do with Fischer, but a last-grandstand by el Sloan while
he still has the public eye.

The &quot;public eye&quot; he thinks he has is probably the equilivant to 1

Do you now how much money the prison members contribute every year as

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. Please bring it up because, if you do not, I intend to.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has been reported that the reason Bill Goichberg does not want to
&gt;&gt;&gt; let Fischer back into the USCF is because Fischer is anti-Semitic.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has also been reported that Goichberg objected to allowing Boris
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spassky to give a simultaneous chess exhibition in New Jersey because
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spassky is anti-Semitic.
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I feel, and I think that most chess players agree, that a
&gt;&gt;&gt; chess player's political or social views should have no bearing on
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether they should be allowed to play chess.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sam Sloan
&gt;&gt; Anyone can play.. however membership to an organization could and
&gt;&gt; should have some limitations. If it didn't you would have murderers
&gt;&gt; and child pronography pedophiles infiltrating the membership ranks. So
&gt;&gt; the question isn't if Fischer should be permitted to play chess( a
&gt;&gt; game he has abandoned) but rather should good people foot his bill to
&gt;&gt; belong to an organization for free?

&gt; In fact we have many such persons.

&gt; We have several thousand prison members including some mass murderers,
&gt; all dues paying members of the USCF.

&gt; If they are members, why not let in Fischer who has not been convicted

I thought they were called loan &quot;sharks&quot;?

On the subject of Fischer-obsessing, I am reading
the August 2007 issue of Chess Life, and have not
yet run across any references to him; this strikes
me as odd, since in the old days just about every
writer in CL seemed to be obsessed with the man,
in spite of his long retirement from active play.  It is
refreshing to see the rational discussion of chess
and chess players, without the mandatory obsessing
over BF of old.

Even so, some of the annotated games are not
very good, and writers seem to be straining to find
*something* worthy of praise to fawn over.  In BF's
heyday, this was not a problem, as he routinely
produced (when he played) masterpieces filled with
brilliant moves.  Ah, but I am obsessing... .  :&gt;D

Of course it's rational, even logical that our government would have taken

Irrational thinking (again).

If what Bobby Fischer did was not illegal, then
obviously he would never have been indicted.
Duh!

And although it is correct that some chess
related publications came out of the same
country (or very close), two wrongs do not
make a right; that's just incompetence with
simple math.  What you get when you *add*
(getting the operation right is crucial!) two
wrongs, is a lot of wrong.

when they just can't handle reality.  Get a

That is correct. When the EB suspended GM Fischer, I volunteered to read the
very same transcript and be suspended too.

USCF should only suspend folks over their chess acts -- if they cheat at
chess, cheat at the ratings, fail to submit reports or dues, etc.  Even
Michael Vick should be allowed to join USCF, if he wishes.  His non-chess
behavior really shouldn't matter at all.

No more Pachmans, please!

I suspect  the interviewer's intended point was that Kasparov has no
more political credibility in Russia than Fischer does in the USA, so
why does the Western press insist on giving Kasparov so much political

That is a plausible interpretation of the question. Frankly I don't

in Russia. Can any of our Russian and/or European readers here shed

It's not hard to find people more reasonable than Fischer, who among
other things has said that Jews kill Christian children and use their
blood to make matzoh bread. Kasparov, to my knowledge, has never said
anything at all so offensive, but he does entertain a few strange
views (e.g. on history). In chess politics, the main kind he's been
involved with until recently, his record has not been very impressive,
IMO. He has started up various organizations (the GMA, PCA, WCC, etc.)
that seem to start strong, but quickly fizzle when he loses interest.
I would think more persistence will be required of anyone serious
about opposing Putin.

It's not that GK has failed in his persistence; it is
that he wants to control and dominate these new
organizations, and when he doesn't get his way he
acts like a spoiled child and then without his support,
the orgs. weaken and fail.  I seem to recall that after
being headed by GK for a while, one election has the
result of putting Jan Timman in charge, whereupon
GK balked.  The man (child, really) wants to be the
COB, CEO, CFO, and Dictator-for-life -- all or nothing.

Because these problems are so severe, I can't help
bot wonder when I see pictures of GK being arrested
by Russian police, if he isn't doing it all just to get
attention.  You know, like Sam Sloan, or any other
overgrown child.

Recently, on the speculation of a mush-money match, [more thanb any amount
ever before] he wanted to know the ethnicity of everyone, including the film

His chess is unquestionable the most fascinating of the whole C20th.

---

I hope he gets out of chess now. I hope he stops sacrificing himself to a
public image of himself, and the complexity of what that entails - much as
any public figure experiences. What better place to do so than in
egalitarian Iceland?

I doubt few could have gone through that cold-war encounter without injury
to self, and this boy had no father: No man to buoy him up, and be candid,
frank and straight with him, without aggression. That is an entirely other
battle, which arguably is as great as defeating the Russian's at chess.

Fischer served as an icon for US interests while it served them to represent
him as such - the man personally is as distorted by this as others have
been, no more no less, in my opinion.

In himself I think he is brave in emotional and intellectual pursuit of what
he admits true, and now requires the space to assess his life and times, and
then we will, at length, see the man himself, if he should chose to make
that public. It is a quintessentially American thing to either do so, or
not, without compulsion.

But nothing is owed to other people on that basis, though I think much could
be understood thereby!

You too are a Celt, and we do not treat 'Greats' with especial respect. It
is as if someone had endured a trial to achieve a difficult goal, and we
never suspect them to have done so without personal damage, no?

This, in my philosophy, allows the trial, and also its reception by a
public, since lest we too are tested to the same degree, and to cite an
admonition in the Bible, do we judge?

&gt; The Western countries should have said &quot;Alekhine did what he had to do to
&gt; survive during the war -- we invite him to our tournaments.&quot;
">

From THIS CRAZY WORLD OF CHESS by GM Larry Evans

Arnold Denker's greatest regret was turning against world champion Alexander
Alekhine because of some anti-Semitic articles he wrote under pressure
from the Nazis while trapped in war-torn Europe. Arnie said:

&quot;I knew both German and his handwriting. He wrote those
infamous articles. I endorsed a world wide ban of Alekhine, a
grave error. Alekhine had been my friend. You do not desert a
friend. I should have stuck with him as he was dying in Lisbon
and try to find the facts, the pressures of war on him. Nowadays
I agree with Larry Evans who wrote in Chess Life that you have
to be awfully careful about banning people in chess...people
change, have horrendous mental problems sometimes.war
time duress. We are all sinners and you can take that to the bank.
Holier than thou does not work!&quot;
-----

Larry, Arnold wrote me a bit directly - I think he made comments here too.

Nevermind Alekhine being ostracised as a deliberate policy by Britain - He
was there just after the war, and witnessed the struggle to survive. Chess
players were so far from being a priority they didn't even appear on the
social radar - meanwhile all Eastern Europe was being gobbled up by the
Soviets. He thought, as I did, that concern about the fate of a chessplayer
riding out the war in a neutral country was grotesque at a time when English
people were sharing their bread ration with German people.

Rather than Tartakower, it was Max Euwe who eventually prevailed in
re-admitting Alekhine to what was left of any European social scene,
famously saying, 'Humanity is the best revenge.'

As for Fischer, the idea of 're-instating' him to USCF is obscene. He
plainly does not want to be associated with it, and actively /resents/ that
association. Unless anyone can assert a difference since last winter when I
made a few calls to Saemi in Iceland.

BUT! If, and only if, he wanted to play chess in the USA, then the conundrum
of 'membership' exists. What are people pledging as members that is clearly
distinct than paying for ratings? Therefore, it is a self-made problem for
USCF since 'membership' suggests some joint pledge to a collective goal, no?
Otherwise membership is a daft requirement, since I am no more a member of
the IRS because they count the buttons I owe them every year as their
clerical function in taxing my income,

The other problem is citizenship, and in that instance, to play in the USA
as a citizen, would require him to take a pledge - and this is an even less
certain prospect!

To return to the chessis question: What Fischer still resents [according to
my understanding] is that USCF used his name against his wishes, and to
their own benefit. That is the business before us here, raised by Sam Sloan,
who, as usual does not deign to notice this fact.

---

After the war there all sorts of attempts to ressurect the prospects of
collaborators. Famously Eric Blair [George Orwell] successfully pleaded for
the life of that great British Twit, P. G. Woodhouse, in an essay which
plainly described him as a hapless and naive fool. He also had a hand in
saving the American poet Ezra Pound who had broadcast Italian propaganda for
Mussolini.

But those are national concerns, not chessic ones - and the charges brought
against Fischer need be clarified in terms of them, since they are an
uncertain mix of tax-evasion, playing chess in a war-zone against the direct
wishes of the government, and whatever the Japanese holding-cell charges
actually contained. I think government cannot /pardon/ 'charges', since
there is still a presumption of innocence in USA, and AFAIK, no court has
demonstrated a felony. The issue may be for Fischer, that if he returns
here, then the government made legitamately try to do so.

If it does, then it can then also pardon Fischer.

So you argue that Fischer /should/ be admitted to USCF /because/ of his

That is pure Sovietism - only there, Politicos declared you ill and put you

Bravo! Who could now object? I hope Senator Gravel is reading this, since he
will either immediately join USCF himself, or catching which way the wind

I believe in post-WWII Europe that was not exactly the sort of 'crime' that
concerned those conducting the Nuremburg trials. The wall was going up

western tradition, not the eastern one. Meanwhile in England people hoped
there wouldn't be a revolution. That, I think, was a concern about admission
of dubious aliens at the time.

&gt; ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

&gt; &gt;From THIS CRAZY WORLD OF CHESS by GM Larry Evans (Cardoza Publishers,

&gt; Surprised by arriving to a tumultuous hero's welcome in Reykjavik,
&gt; Fischer told a midnight crowd that he plans to stay there. &quot;If the
&gt; people get
&gt; tired of me, they can take away my citizenship later,&quot; he said.
&gt; So far he has kept a low profile, but some observers are wondering
&gt; when he will bite the hand that freed him.

&gt; In a letter from congressman Christopher Shays to a constituent in
&gt; Connecticut in 2005, he stated:

&gt; &quot;I do not believe that the United States should stop their
&gt; pursuit and prosecution of Bobby Fischer. A warrant was issued
&gt; for his arrest but never served since he has never returned to
&gt; America. After his arrest in Japan he also accused President
&gt; Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi of conspiring
&gt; against him and said, 'They should be hanged.' The bottom
&gt; line is Mr. Fischer broke the law and should be returned to the
&gt; United States where he can be tried for the crimes of which
&gt; he is accused. However, earlier this year, Iceland's parliament
&gt; granted him asylum and citizenship for bringing attention and
&gt; honor to the country in 1972 for beating Spassky there.&quot;

Larry,

As unjust as the law is, the law is the law. Fischer could have
RENOUNCED his US citizenship. He did not, and therefore, should be
pardonded only if the law is changed to allow any American to travel
to Cuba, and play in Chess tournaments with war criminals. Bobby does
not deserve a pardon, due to his views. I think that he should be
treated as Scotter Libby, and be forced into court proceedings, and
fined, and then left alone. However, nobody cares what I think.

Fischer deserves Icelands. He is cold as hell.

Fischer's crime is spitting SNOT (bugers) on a US order not to play in
a chess tournament in a war zone. That snot will give him 10 years in
the pokey. His choices were to RENOUNCE his US Citizenship, or not
play. Fischer wanted a US passport, and be able to play the law.
Therefore, he is like Scotter Libby.

There appears to be a complete disconnect from
reality here.  Fact: even if Bobby Fischer were to be
pardoned, he would still never come back to the
USA on account of the back taxes, plus penalties
and interest owed to the IRS.  All this moaning and
groaning about &quot;rights&quot; makes me want to vomit; a
U.S. citizen has obligations as well as rights, and
one of the most annoying of these is our obligation
to pay taxes; in fact, it is so annoying that it is
difficult to imagine even the die-hard Fischerites

Nah, spitting on the document is protected by free

paid millions of dollars to play in a war zone (or
what have you) in direct violation of some sanction
or other.

Secondly, you have attempted to blur the lines
between what constitutes bugers, snot, and spit;
these are all known to be distinctly different things,
as even a child can tell you.  Nearly as bad, you
tried to toss in the passport affair, as if deliberately
trying to confuse the issue.  I expect you must be
one of the insane Fischerites, blinded by hero-
worship of some sort.  Get it into your head: he is
never coming back.  Ne-vah; not ev-ah.

It was not against US law, it was contra an executive order.

Whether, indeed, it is a crime to play a game of ritual conflict, instead of
actually engaging in real flesh-and-blood conflict, is the issue of a little
[constitutional] contention, Marcus.

That is the untested issue in court, otherwise its as if the Presdent ruled
by fiat rather than rule of law proposed by Congress and ultimately defined
by the Supreme Court.

In this instance, by making this personal admonition against Fischer, the
issue would be if emergency and special measures against Fischer from the
most powerful man on earth, is yet constitutionally correct and justified,
and that, Sir, is the issue.

It is an untested one, and I do not mean to say I favour Fischer over the US
Executive. I mean it is an open question to the extent that the government
would need to prove their case before either other arm of government, and
here, before the Supreme Court.

No?

Fischer would have to be shown to be acting in support of an enemy, actively
or passively, rather than, as it seems to me, to being completely
indifferent to the politics surrounding his games of chess with Boris
Spassky.

If it seemed that Fischer had in his own mind, that by playing in a ritual
conflict, instead of engaging in a real one, he thought he was doing
something beneficial to international relations - that would be the tricky
field the US government would have to negotiate, since it does guarantee a
freedom of conscience, and is in fact, why it exists at all.

But whatever I or you think, the actual matter which needs to be addressed
is no clearer than the reasons for his detension in Japan.

Good point.  In other words, for violating Ed Edmondson's
executive order Mr. Fischer should lose his job at the USCF,
no more.  Were Mr. Edmondson a government official, things
would be different; who does he think he is, a town sheriff or
something?

Who do you think *appoints* those guys on the
Supreme Court --  Mickey Mouse?  Look, the way it
was explained to me (in junior high school perhaps)
is there are three &quot;equal&quot; branches of the U.S.
government; but some branches are just more
equal than others.  Since then, the SC has become
less and less &quot;equal&quot;, and the Executive branch has
been grabbing more and more power, like a snowball
rolling downhill.

The Supreme Court is not automatically invoked
on account of chess players' obsession with Bobby
Fischer.  There is a legal process, and the man (no,
BF is not a god -- sheesh!) needs to go through it
just like anybody else.  It's a technical thing, relating
as it were, to reality, not fantasies of &quot;BF returns&quot; or
even chess in general.  Believe it or not, it relates
more to the law than to chess.

On this issue you are clearly irrational if not prejudiced (I hope at
least not of the Zionist kind), and I generally avoid wasting my time
arguing in such cases - I have more constructive things to do - I will,
however, attempt to reason with you on a minor point: For Fischer
himself the main importance of a pardon would be that he would be free
to travel to countries other than the US. Do you disagree with this? I
suppose that you may disagree in this too, but in this case at least I
will have to admit that there is a small possibility that you are right.

Any constitutional test would involve a challenge to an executive
order carrying the weight of federal law since there was no act of
Congress and Congress is specifically given the powers to make laws.

It's been since 1992 so I'm having trouble remembering if Congress
ever enacted restrictions on commerce with Serbia at the time?  If so
then Fischer would not have a leg to stand on, but if it was merely
the executive branch trying to enforce a law of its own he might have
a worthwhile argument.

Of course, this is no analogy at all - unless Tiger Woods also thought the

&gt;&gt; I believe in post-WWII Europe that was not exactly the sort of 'crime'
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; concerned those conducting the Nuremberg trials. The wall was going up
&gt;&gt; around Europe enclosing regions far into the west who were always of the
&gt;&gt; western tradition, not the eastern one. Meanwhile in England people hoped
&gt;&gt; there wouldn't be a revolution. That, I think, was a concern about
&gt;&gt; admission

&gt;&gt; of dubious aliens at the time.

&gt; USCF and Britain's chess groups *actively* worked against Alekhine,
&gt; choosing
&gt; to deny him invitations.
">

In late 1945 he could have been viewed as a war-criminal. After all,
race-hatred had slaughtered 10 million people.

While there is doubt of the circumstances under which he wrote the article
[to the degree of coercion], and while as you said before, the material
begins with the usual crude jibes about 'Jewish chess', it does end with
examples of Alekhine's own knowledge of specific Jewish people, exempting
them from the aforesaid 'conditions'.

Nevertheless, we should not actually deny he wrote them, or a copy was found
by his wife under his bed!

In 1946 Max Euwe swayed the international community, successfully to
re-instate him into the chess circuit. I would say that UK and US chess
authorities took very prudent pause before letting the man back into the
game. In terms of society as a whole, he was also liable to the life of the
times, and their judgment.

Players in Europe were not generally ostracized for collaborating with
German chess events. Keres [as well as AA] also played in Munich in 1942. It
was the Zeitinger articles which - if you will excuse we Europeans from
mentioning our own condition - that needed some explanation, otherwise Eric,
civilians who had been bombed for 5 years did not care a damn for some
Russian émigré who played chess - or in fact, anyone who played chess. It
wasn't about chess, you see, if was about still surviving on a wrecked
continent.

">

Other people got to play even less chess in the preceding 6 years, and, if
the KGB didn't kill him, the booze did.

It /is/ a hate crime to have written that material, even if under coercion.
If Alekhine was depressed by not immediately being returned to center stage
by these people who had endured the war and had to clean up its aftermath -
nor have his own part in it assessed, then we should add that his ego also
killed him.
