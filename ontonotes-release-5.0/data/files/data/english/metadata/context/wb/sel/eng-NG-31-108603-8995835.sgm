Hello Everyone,

I am 24 yrs old. Last year i had a cataract operation last year due to
eye injury in the past. Recently I started noticing streaks on the
lights. They are minor, they don't bother me as much.

I suspect this may be posterior capsule opacification (PCO).

I have an appt. with the doctor later next month.

I just wanted to know if somebody could provide an opinion as to, if I
decide not to get YAG laser surgery, would this thing only get worse?

I read somewhere that a person should this surgery in early stage
rather than later on, is it true?

And if I do get it in early stages, would the PCO continue, until its
ripe? (idea behind this is that, the progression may continue, even
after surgery?)

Thanks.

- Jay

Not a doctor here, Jay, just another patient.   I had cataract surgery
on one eye and my vision was not very clear afterward.  Not what I'd
hoped.  (previous lasik left some corneal irregularities).  This would
not apply to you unless you had previous corneal damage.

I was told the capsular opacification is likely to start earlier in
younger patients.  That would seem the case with you.  If you decide
not to get the YAG surgery, I'd think it would continue to darken
until you would change your mind.  I waited about a year after the
cataract surgery before I had the YAG procedure.

Your doctor should be able to answer your specifics.  No one else can
say for sure &quot;it is capsular opacification.&quot;  If that's what (and all)
it is, the YAG should clear it up.  It's done in the doc's office and
takes just a few minutes.  Not painful.

Thanks,

You know sort of same thing with me. Since the surgery I have notice
that I see from a &quot;tinted&quot; glass through the operated eye.

Is this the same case with you? And did it improve after the YAG?

Jay, my case is different than yours.  I had lasik surgery which
damaged my corneas first.  That being said, after the YAG surgery, I
got more light into the eye and this made the existing corneal
abberations more visible to me.

If your corneas are healthy, the YAG should clear things up nicely--
but only your doctor knows this.  There was little post-op procedure
with the YAG, perhaps as you said, see the doc a week later.

None for me (had it done in both eyes, five years apart).  It works
almost instantly.
