Only idiotic, moronic people like you have bad feelings for Tom, why
because you prefer the feelings of a coked up, alcoholic, murdering son
of a bitch rather than someone who is genuine.

Psss, all that shit, like the holocust, was just made up about Richard,
it really never happened.
It's just a conspriacy I tell ya.

How do you know bad feelings are attached to him, do you know him, have
you felt him up or something? Been peeking in his window? Besides the
mind reading portion of your post, what evidence can you offer?

I'd just let them be. If they want to insult anyone and everyone who doubts

I don't have bad feelings towards him, he is just a little pathetic and
a bit of a liar

Just read responses to his posts and you will see the bad feeling he
has attached to himself essentially skillfully.

It still baffles my why a man who doesn't use, teach, endorse or
approve of NLP is saturating an NLP newsgroup with non NLP posts.
Please explain it to me.  Tom Vizzinis greates victory is in turning

And the nlp trainers who constantly post for their seminars what is
that,
more bulletin bored &lt;---not misspelled.) materials?

What is really pathetic is people like you who constantly complain
about him and that you can't have any nlp discussions but when offered
the chance to discuss nlpee pee, you all decline. I think it is
actually pretty funny that he, Tom, just by writing a post can bring
out all the moronic nlp cult fans to flame him. You consistantly dance
to the tune of, I'm your flame bitch, push my button and watch me go
and yet you can't get off the merry go round.

You have all been invited to discuss nlp time and time again, yet you
prefer flame wars, what does that say about your mentality and your
skills.

I don't see a bunch of bad feelings attached to him, all I see are a
bunch of pathetic losers who have nothing more to offer than flames.
They feel slighted because he has proven nlp to be nothing more than
placebo, outdated and expensive and that just gets your goat.

What I find so hilarious is the fact of nlp saying phycology was
bullshit, and now that nlp is under the magnifying glass, your
screaming and hollaring foul, foul. You just can't stand the fact that
your beliefs are being challenged and that the outcome just may be
you've been duped and you spent your hard earned money and time on
nothing.

So keep up the good flame wars, your just illustrating to Tom that he
is successful. Pissing you off, and your responding is just showing him
he got to you.

Success isn't in what you say you can do but in what you can do. He
shares the success stories of his students, you share you vile venom
against him, now who can do?

Once again Camoron distorts the facts, so here they are, in 1987 I was
shooting coke, but quit on my own, no rehab or jail time and guess
what? I knew nothing of nlp or anything like that and that part of my
life was only about 3 months long. Now Richard, nlp co-founder was into
it for years and knew everything about nlp, yet until the murder
couldn't stop and or did he stop afterwards?

You once again twist the facts to suit your own slimy mentailty, it is
truly a shame that you have to resort to tactic's like that since you
have nothing else. Now run shamefully back to that rock from which your
crawled out from under.

As for my name, my real name is at the beginning of the e-mails, which
I don't seek to hide.
You on the other hand, all we really know about you is your a lying
sack of shit.

Coke head,

Apparantly you didn't stop doing drugs in time to save enough brain
cells.

Wipe the foam off your mouth and see if you can figure out the meaning
of my very simple words.

Or ask somebody smarter than you for help with comprehension.

What is "NLP" anyway? The methods for modeling  or the trail of
techniques(therapeutic/persuasive/performance enhancement) that come out of
the methods for modeling? Or does NLP also include the personalities
involved and their squabbles and foibles?

One can't talk about NLP being a "placebo" without first defining "NLP".

The "NLP" model for hypnosis is workable.  The NLP phobia cure still works.
The NLP model for modeling excellence works, and keeps improving.

Some of the premises and assumptions of NLP don't match any reality I know
of, and ought to be junked.  Some, even many of the trail of techniques have
become superseded by other things, or just never really worked as claimed in
the first place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You mean, of course, "Psychology" and how could "NLP" say anything. You have
to mean some NLP teachers have labeled aspects of traditional psychotherapy
as bullshit, such as Bandler knocking some of the core assumptions of
Freudian and other abreactive therapies.

He's not the only one; many "psychotherapists" of the cognitive schools
would say much the same.

But bear in mind, NLP started out by modeling psychotherapists: Erickson,
Satir, Perls.  Certainly, B and G started out with the
observation/assumption that these folks were VERY effective or they never
would have modeled them in the first place.

So even there, Bandler never knocked all therapists, did he?

I really find your reasoning and writing to be pretty sloppy.

Seems like you might have a classic case of transference.

You didn't like the person you were.

R Bandler was you model. You could relate to his addiction through your own lifestyle. Maybe you even worshiped him once upon a time.

You transferred all of your own negative self-values onto Bandler.

Now you think you hate him, where you used to hate yourself.

So now you consciously hate Bandler, who knows what subconsciously, and you have turned groupie to find that security you seem to have lacking in your life.

If you feel such negativity to anyone, then you do seem to be exhibiting symptoms of some problem.

First learn to love yourself, then you might find you can love others, warts and all.

I take it to be a model implemented with an attitude (of curiosity,

I agree.  Much of NLP was modelled from what effective people were
doing.  If all of NLP is placebo, then the effective therapists must
also have used placebo.  And so everything Tom Vizzini has learnt and
uses is in fact placebo.

You been gone a while Ross, shame on you. missed your colours.

We can go on and on about different trainers even you bashed over the
years for their flawed personalities but that would take a lot of time

Now I find that statement really interesting, you obviously didn't pay
much attention to Dr. Ken's presentation of his brain model on how the
brain actually works. The phobia cure engages the V/K/A but doesn't
engage the primal drivers which are the emotions, which is in the
limbic system. So any effect the phobia cure has, is strictly placebo.
How is it some can use it effectively and some can't? The difference is
in weather they believe it can or not.
Where as the 3-D Mind doesn't rely on that but relies on finding those
drivers in the limbic system and taking care of the problem, weather
you believe in it or not. Simple brain science.

Due in part to its open-ended philosophy, NLP is controversial. It is
at times criticized in the scientific community as unproven or
pseudoscientific[14], and amongst those who watch for fraud, for
exaggerated claims and unethical approaches by a number of
practitioners.There is also some dispute among its developers and
proponents regarding what NLP is and is not.

Claims to science

Singer (1996) states that "NLP often associates itself with science in
order to raise its own prestige" [25]. Winkin (1990) considers such
promotion to be "intellectually fraudulent" and compares NLP's
association with Science to astrology's association to astronomy.

Wouldn't you just love to see some double blind studies done on nlp?
Instead of just taking someone's word for it?

&gt;Some, even many of the trail of techniques have

Why are they assholes or how did they come to be that way?  In any case, I
don't buy into the question no matter how it is phrased as it is argumentum
ad hominem. The fact that someone won't or doesn't apply their own
self-improvement technology to themselves does not, by itself, negate the
effectiveness of the technology.

You can't argue, in one breath, that the effectiveness of a technology is
measured in double-blind scientific tests, and then, in another, that it is
measured(or even reflected) in the personal lives of the teachers.

And and all of them, and more to the point, Milton himself, in the forward

That's your assumption and what Dr. Ken said is not relevant to my point.

We don't know exactly what the phobia cure engages. I respect Dr. Ken as a
friend and as a scientist, but he has done not ONE scientific study on the
phobia cure OR on 3-D Mind. Don't hold up double blind studies as the only
acceptable standard unless you apply it fairly and evenly around.

And...."the placebo" effect explains NOTHING. It doesn't explain the
mechanism of HOW suggestion actually results in real changes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's an assumption and it might be true. Then again, people who they use
it on often do NOT believe it will work; after a lifetime of the fear, the
client is convinced THE OTHER way, that it will NOT work. So this would
actually tend to argue AGAINST a "placebo" effect, as it usually requires
belief on the client's end, more than the practitioner.

That's an assumption about 3-D Mind. There are NO "double blind studies", or
indeed any science at all to suggest that 3-D Mind isn't placebo EITHER.
And the same issues about it not always working crop up.

Don't get me wrong: I personally think 3-D Mind is a very powerful set of
tools that no one should be without. I just don't think your criticisms of
what you call "NLP" can't equally be applied to 3-D Mind and it's
creators/founders. Sauce for the goose.

Where are the double-blind studies on 3-D Mind? How can we be 100% certain
IT is also not due to "placebo" whatever that actually means?

I am going to breifly jump in here on this. Because I disagree with it
wholeheartedly.

I think that the person teaching is a reflection of the technology.

This is a point that you have made over and over again. I am curious as to
why your opinion has changed.

Are you saying that the teacher should not have to live up to what he
teaches? Would you learn yoga from someone who could not do one pose? Would
you learn meditation from someone who was constantly stressed out? Would you
learn self defense from someone who got his ass kicked all the time by old
ladies?

Or

Does a teacher who can do all the things they teach a BETTER example and
have more credibility? I think so.

Personally I am tired of the hypocrites who claim to be gurus ending up
being fakes and phonies. You and I both can name a stream of them. We have
exposed a stream of them right here on this group. So many can talk the talk
but fail to walk the walk.

Lead by example. If you can't then don't lead at all.

This is the concept that seperates the keyboard jockeys from the genuinely
skilled.

Damn, if I couldn't anchor someone should I teach anchoring? Hell no.

I am not going to spend my time bashing NLP. Like you told me a while ago,
Even if the 3D mind is only as effective as NLP, it is better because it is
simple and can be learned for 70 dollars instead of 15,000 dollars.

I think that is the most valuable disctinction there is at this point.

&gt; I think that the person teaching is a reflection of the technology.

&gt; This is a point that you have made over and over again. I am curious as to
&gt; why your opinion has changed.

&gt; Are you saying that the teacher should not have to live up to what he
&gt; teaches? Would you learn yoga from someone who could not do one pose? Would
&gt; you learn meditation from someone who was constantly stressed out? Would you
&gt; learn self defense from someone who got his ass kicked all the time by old
&gt; ladies?

Surely NLP is about choice, and if Bandler lives how he chooses then
that is congruent with "Walking the walk".

&gt; We can go on and on about different trainers even you bashed over the

&gt; and effort to give something you already know.

&gt; &gt; One can't talk about NLP being a &quot;placebo&quot; without first defining &quot;NLP&quot;.

&gt; This is going to be interesting and fun.

&gt; &gt; The &quot;NLP&quot; model for hypnosis is workable.

&gt; Workable from which stand point? Therapy? Modeling? Relaxing?

&gt; &gt; The NLP phobia cure still works.

&gt; Now I find that statement really interesting, you obviously didn't pay
&gt; much attention to Dr. Ken's presentation of his brain model on how the
&gt; brain actually works. The phobia cure engages the V/K/A but doesn't
&gt; engage the primal drivers which are the emotions, which is in the
&gt; limbic system. So any effect the phobia cure has, is strictly placebo.
&gt; How is it some can use it effectively and some can't? The difference is
&gt; in weather they believe it can or not.
&gt; Where as the 3-D Mind doesn't rely on that but relies on finding those
&gt; drivers in the limbic system and taking care of the problem, weather
&gt; you believe in it or not. Simple brain science.

&gt; &gt; The NLP model for modeling excellence works, and keeps improving.

&gt; Really and who did Richard model, Charles Manson? This modeling you
&gt; speak of in nlp, I really don't know much of because when I learned it,
&gt; I wasn't much impressed so I forgot about it. So I can't really debate
&gt; it.

&gt; &gt; Some of the premises and assumptions of NLP don't match any reality I know
&gt; &gt; of, and ought to be junked.

&gt; I agree except I think most of it should be junked because it is
&gt; nothing more than a junk science.

&gt; http://www.sueknight.co.uk/Publications/Articles/NLP_Plausible.htm
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming

&gt; Due in part to its open-ended philosophy, NLP is controversial. It is
&gt; at times criticized in the scientific community as unproven or
&gt; pseudoscientific[14], and amongst those who watch for fraud, for
&gt; exaggerated claims and unethical approaches by a number of
&gt; practitioners.There is also some dispute among its developers and
&gt; proponents regarding what NLP is and is not.

&gt; Claims to science

&gt; Singer (1996) states that &quot;NLP often associates itself with science in
&gt; order to raise its own prestige&quot; [25]. Winkin (1990) considers such
&gt; promotion to be &quot;intellectually fraudulent&quot; and compares NLP's
&gt; association with Science to astrology's association to astronomy.

&gt; Wouldn't you just love to see some double blind studies done on nlp?
&gt; Instead of just taking someone's word for it?

&gt;  &gt;Some, even many of the trail of techniques have
&gt; &gt; become superseded by other things, or just never really worked as claimed in
&gt; &gt; the first place.

&gt; Wow that is an understatement, but again thanks for proving my point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What I find so hilarious is the fact of nlp saying phycology was
&gt; &gt; &gt; bullshit,

&gt; &gt; You mean, of course, &quot;Psychology&quot; and how could &quot;NLP&quot; say anything. You have
&gt; &gt; to mean some NLP teachers have labeled aspects of traditional psychotherapy
&gt; &gt; as bullshit, such as Bandler knocking some of the core assumptions of
&gt; &gt; Freudian and other abreactive therapies.

&gt; Ok, now we are going to nit pick? You know what was meant by that
&gt; statement and yes, now nlp is under the gun but damn, they just can't
&gt; stand it.

&gt; &gt; He's not the only one; many &quot;psychotherapists&quot; of the cognitive schools
&gt; &gt; would say much the same.

&gt; That wasn't the point, the point was that other disciplines was lam
&gt; blasted by teachers of nlp and now when nlp comes under fire they
&gt; scream and hollar. Defend the realm without facts or figures to back
&gt; their shit up, all we have is their word for it.

&gt; &gt; But bear in mind, NLP started out by modeling psychotherapists: Erickson,
&gt; &gt; Satir, Perls.  Certainly, B and G started out with the
&gt; &gt; observation/assumption that these folks were VERY effective or they never
&gt; &gt; would have modeled them in the first place.

&gt; Of course they were very effective but does that mean they were
&gt; actually able to model what they actually did? Or did they think they
&gt; knew what they were doing?

&gt; &gt; So even there, Bandler never knocked all therapists, did he?

&gt; No, I guess he was to busy commiting murder to care, again you missed
&gt; the point.

&gt; &gt;  I really find your reasoning and writing to be pretty sloppy.

&gt; The question begs do I care what you think, you want to wait for the
&gt; answer or do you already know? I find your reasoning to be really
&gt; narrow minded, unscientifically sound and pretty pointless.

I find this interesting coming from you, Tom. Several of us have pointed
out that your advertizing approach is rude and pandering. I, for one,
have argued that such an advertizing approach suggests an
ineffectiveness of your product. As stated in many other posts, in my
opinion, your advertizing turns off many more customers than it
attracts. I believe the people attracted to your product by its
advertizing are generally from the shallower end of the gene pool. That
can be confirmed by reading many of your supporters' posts, which
frequently degenerate into childish name calling and insults. Quite
ineffective for influencing opinions. Your response, in essence, is that
the advertizing does not completely reflect the product and the product
is of high quality. Now you are saying the teacher (you, for 3D Mind)
should reflect the "technology" (product). Your product is about
influencing people to get what you want. Since you appear to write your
advertizing copy and you certainly approve it, one may presume that it
reflects your product. Therefore, what are we to surmise about your
product? From your above statement, you have confirmed my opinion of
your product (it is low quality and ineffective). That, or you must
admit that you do not reflect your own technology, thereby undercutting
your own position. Perhaps you should reconsider or clarify your position.

On a side note: I generally agree with Tom's statement. I do believe the
"technology" should be reflected by the teacher. I would not want to be
hypnotized for smoking cessation or weight loss by an obese, 3 pack a
day smoker hypnotherapist (they are out there). However, "reflected" is
the key word. No one is perfect, so relatively minor imperfections are
reasonable. However, if some guy claims his technique will get you laid
but he hasn't been with a woman in years and still lives in his mothers
apartment, I would sure question the effectiveness of his product.

Here is the most important thing:  Bandler's ultimate skill as a modeler
doesn't require him to apply what he learned to himself to improve his own

on yourself.  Satir and Perls couldn't manage to do it, but it didn't affect

No it doesn't. because the phobia cure is using mainly the neo-cortex
of the brain, where real change doesn't happen, if you had paid

phobia cure only works when the placebo is in effect. Do you even know
what the placebo effect is? Richard did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's your assumption and what Dr. Ken said is not relevant to my point.

&gt; Ken or anyone else.
">

Of course again you want to ignor the facts when it doesn't help your
case. Again what Dr. Ken said, in his brain model, is that in the
limbic system is where change occurs. All change work, it happens in
the limbic system and flows to the neo-cortex. The phobia cure happens
only in the neo-cortex portion of the brain, except when the placebo is
ingaged.
Of course you don't want information like this because it destroys your

&gt;I respect Dr. Ken as a friend and as a scientist, but he has done not
ONE scientific study &gt;on the phobia cure OR on 3-D Mind.

Nice switch.

&gt;Don't hold up double blind studies as the only

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; acceptable standard unless you apply it fairly and evenly around.
">

No, he hasn't done one study on the phobia cure but he is a brain
scientist, which you can not deny and had explained to Tom and Kim how
the 3-D Mind works and why is it so powerful. Tom and Kim with the help
of Dr. Ken has refined the 3-D Mind and is very different from when it
first began, you know that. So now what? Let's throw out the brain guy
because he hasn't done any studies on the 3-D Mind? You refered to
Milton as an excellent reference to that book, but your not taking the
word of a brain scientist as gospel?

The phobia cure is bullshit, we only have your and other moronic nlp
cult followers word that it works. Now we have a different point of
view, mine, with an explaination why it doesn't or will work under
certain circumstances, and you've offered nothing but your opinion, nor
has anyone else offered anything more than their opinion as to why the
phobia cure works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And....&quot;the placebo&quot; effect explains NOTHING. It doesn't explain the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's an assumption and it might be true. Then again, people who they use

&gt; actually tend to argue AGAINST a &quot;placebo&quot; effect, as it usually requires
&gt; belief on the client's end, more than the practitioner.
">

So do you have any evidence of this or are you just grasping at straws
again trying to convince yourself and others of the power of the phobia
cure. The really simple facts your trying to ignor or cover over is
simply the power of the placebo used in the phobia cure.
Slice it or dice it any way you want, the phobia cures power lies in
the placebo effect.
The problem really lies in people like you who's head is so far up your

No your entirely right, there has been no studies done, but the fact
that Dr. Ken, which some clowns on here think is made up, endorses the

I am expecting a very lengthy response rj, please don't disappoint me,
nor the puppets who think they have a new hero.  At the least you give
a decent arguement, heavily flawed because you only point out your
opinions, but arguement non the less, I guess you are the new nlp
champion coming to defend the cultish nlp realm and after all those
years of bashing nlp trainers, one has to wonder why. I was actually
going to leave this ng because it became seriously boring, no real
debates about anything but what can you expect from the nlp mutton
headed section of the culf following morons who frequent this forum.

Yes, I do live out in the back woods, yes I do live in a trailer, yes
some of my teeth are rotting, hillbilly..no, sorry wrong about that

I guess I misunderstood what you meant by "technology". I believed 3D
Mind to be a system that can influence people's opinions and attitudes
and thereby affect their actions. I understood that to be a form of
"technology" as you were using the term. If I am incorrect, then the
error is mine and I withdraw my original comments.

However, if 3D Mind is a technology by your definition, and since
marketing is pretty much defined as the influencing of peoples opinions
and attitudes to affect their actions, then, on the surface, 3D Mind
should be effective in marketing. In at least one sense, 3D Mind, could
be considered a sophisticated form of marketing. At the very least it
should be adaptable to marketing. Hypnosis and NLP certainly are. Why
should 3D Mind be that much different?

I realize you have said 3D Mind is most effective in person and not
especially effective over the Internet, so that may be the problem right
there. In that case the problem lies with the medium, not the product.

There has been more than one poster that has done that, though I have

I guess what I am trying to say is from a simple, surface, first
impression view, based on what you say about 3D Mind, it should work for
selling itself. The fact that 3D Mind does not sell itself to me or
several other people in this group implies a lack of effectiveness in
the product/technology.

When I read your advertisements I get the same impression that I get
from someone claiming to be able to make you a millionaire in 12 months
only to discover the person is worth about $150,000 and has been hawking
the product for two years. There may be valid reason for the situation,
but, from first impressions, it suggests the product is ineffective.

As noted above, you have stated that 3D Mind is more effective in person
and suggested it is not as effective for the printed word. That is
perfectly valid, but that does not negate the initial
emotional/irrational gut reaction I get about your product. To make sure
it is not just my personal prejudice, I have shown your advertizing
posts to a few people unfamiliar with NLP, 3D Mind and only passingly
familiar with hypnosis. Though it is a biased sample, virtually all of
them have responded something like "What a bunch of garbage" or "Who
does he think he is fooling?" or simply chuckled at the hyperbole.

You suggest 3D Mind can help people get what they want. A logical
assumption is that you want to sell as much of your product as possible.
However, your advertizing fails to sell to me and others like me.
Therefore we infer that your product is ineffective at helping you get
what you want and would be ineffective at helping us get what we want.

Of course the above logic is flawed. You may want to sell your product
to a particular type of person and my circle is not that type. Miller
Beer does not try to sell to wine drinkers. You have said you are
selling 3D Mind at a fantastic rate and are happy with your results. You
are getting what you want. Therefore, using my above logic, your product
is effective and my first impression is erroneous. But it took
additional information to discover this.

We all know how powerful first impressions are and how difficult they
are to overcome. Isn't it better to give a better first impression than
to have to overcome it later?

For others reading this, I stress that I have never examined 3D Mind, so
I do not know the true quality of the product. It may well be the
greatest thing ever created or complete garbage or anywhere in between.
I simply do not know.

Your already turned off and no matter what, you remain turned off
except if you get to wash Bandlers ass before you kiss it. I'll give
you that respect that at least you do request a clean ass to kiss while
others just fall to their knees.

Now lets take a closer look at Tom's post, he stated what he thought
about his postion, his thinking, his respect. Then you come back with
your dim witted statement.

I really believe none of you can have any opinion out side of Bandlers,
to end all this bullshit once and for all, all you dim witted door knob
fuckers need to do is quit.......do you need any explaination what quit
means?, to quit reading Tom's posts, start your own pathetic posts,
where you can consistantly delude yourselves.

So how about this idea, start your own threads, discuss what ever you
want, any one that joins your thread with negative comments, ignor
them. How much would you like to bet it can't or won't happen because
your first reply will be, because Tom or me, isn't that really a lame
excuse for your lack of posting what you consider decent material to

Is that all you can do, bitch and moan and blame everyone else for your

&gt;&gt;  Why are they assholes or how did they come to be that way?  In any
&gt;&gt;  case, I
&gt;&gt; don't buy into the question no matter how it is phrased as it is
&gt;&gt; argumentum ad hominem. The fact that someone won't or doesn't apply
&gt;&gt; their own self-improvement technology to themselves does not, by
&gt;&gt; itself, negate the effectiveness of the technology.

&gt; Of course you don't want to buy into that, because if you did, you
&gt; would have to stop and ask some serious questions, great technology or
&gt; snake oil? Those spewing it, can't use it.

&gt;&gt; You can't argue, in one breath, that the effectiveness of a
&gt;&gt; technology is measured in double-blind scientific tests, and then, in
&gt;&gt; another, that it is measured(or even reflected) in the personal lives
&gt;&gt; of the teachers.

&gt; Umm, it seems as if there has been no double blind studies, nor
&gt; research done on nlp, so now all we are left with is the word of some
&gt; that this is great technology, so now we are reduced to their
&gt; opinions, second the same applies to those who spew there opinions can
&gt; and did they use it to improve their lives? We all know the answer to
&gt; that one. Tony Robbins failed marriage, drug abuse from richie...nick
&gt; kemp sock puppet master busted using phoney names, alfield, yes the
&gt; nlp record is producing fine up standing people.
&gt; Of course you want to ignor facts budro, so you can promote your
&gt; crappy airy fairy shit, which doesn't even work for you. Which of
&gt; course I shall go into later.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One can't talk about NLP being a &quot;placebo&quot; without first defining
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;NLP&quot;.

&gt; Funny no one can seem to define nlp.

&gt; (Snip)

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Workable from which stand point? Therapy? Modeling? Relaxing?

&gt;&gt; And and all of them, and more to the point, Milton himself, in the
&gt;&gt; forward to &quot;Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton Erickson&quot;
&gt;&gt; says that B and G understand what he does better than he does
&gt;&gt; himself. I'll take that as a pretty damn good endorsement of the job
&gt;&gt; they did at modeling him.

&gt; Most people who write forewords on books don't actually read the book.
&gt; Perhaps you have a point or maybe not. I'll give you this one, but if
&gt; it was bandler only, no.

&gt; MY case in point is Nick Kemp, who's website has an endorsement from
&gt; bandler, did bandler write that or did he just give nicky permission
&gt; to write for him?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The NLP phobia cure still works.

&gt; No it doesn't. because the phobia cure is using mainly the neo-cortex
&gt; of the brain, where real change doesn't happen, if you had paid
&gt; attention to Dr. Ken and his presentation you would know that. The
&gt; phobia cure only works when the placebo is in effect. Do you even know
&gt; what the placebo effect is? Richard did.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; That's your assumption and what Dr. Ken said is not relevant to my
&gt;&gt; point. The NLP  phobia cure works. The people who have been helped by
&gt;&gt; it aren't suddenly going back to being afraid because of any
&gt;&gt; presentation done by Dr. Ken or anyone else.

&gt; Of course again you want to ignor the facts when it doesn't help your
&gt; case. Again what Dr. Ken said, in his brain model, is that in the
&gt; limbic system is where change occurs. All change work, it happens in
&gt; the limbic system and flows to the neo-cortex. The phobia cure happens
&gt; only in the neo-cortex portion of the brain, except when the placebo
&gt; is ingaged.
&gt; Of course you don't want information like this because it destroys
&gt; your pathetic beliefs about your crappy nlp.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; We don't know exactly what the phobia cure engages.

&gt; No, You don't know because your not willing to see past your own ego
&gt; and get a little education.

&gt; &gt;I respect Dr. Ken as a friend and as a scientist, but he has done not
&gt; ONE scientific study &gt;on the phobia cure OR on 3-D Mind.

&gt; Nice switch.

&gt; &gt;Don't hold up double blind studies as the only
&gt;&gt; acceptable standard unless you apply it fairly and evenly around.

&gt; No, he hasn't done one study on the phobia cure but he is a brain
&gt; scientist, which you can not deny and had explained to Tom and Kim how
&gt; the 3-D Mind works and why is it so powerful. Tom and Kim with the
&gt; help of Dr. Ken has refined the 3-D Mind and is very different from
&gt; when it first began, you know that. So now what? Let's throw out the
&gt; brain guy because he hasn't done any studies on the 3-D Mind? You
&gt; refered to Milton as an excellent reference to that book, but your not
&gt; taking the word of a brain scientist as gospel?

&gt; The phobia cure is bullshit, we only have your and other moronic nlp
&gt; cult followers word that it works. Now we have a different point of
&gt; view, mine, with an explaination why it doesn't or will work under
&gt; certain circumstances, and you've offered nothing but your opinion,
&gt; nor has anyone else offered anything more than their opinion as to why
&gt; the phobia cure works.

&gt;&gt; And....&quot;the placebo&quot; effect explains NOTHING. It doesn't explain the
&gt;&gt; mechanism of HOW suggestion actually results in real changes.

&gt; It explains nothing to you, again because your totally uneducated and
&gt; choose tree hugging to facts and figures.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; That's an assumption and it might be true. Then again, people who
&gt;&gt; they use it on often do NOT believe it will work; after a lifetime of
&gt;&gt; the fear, the client is convinced THE OTHER way, that it will NOT
&gt;&gt; work. So this would actually tend to argue AGAINST a &quot;placebo&quot;
&gt;&gt; effect, as it usually requires belief on the client's end, more than
&gt;&gt; the practitioner.

&gt; So do you have any evidence of this or are you just grasping at straws
&gt; again trying to convince yourself and others of the power of the
&gt; phobia cure. The really simple facts your trying to ignor or cover
&gt; over is simply the power of the placebo used in the phobia cure.
&gt; Slice it or dice it any way you want, the phobia cures power lies in
&gt; the placebo effect.
&gt; The problem really lies in people like you who's head is so far up
&gt; your ass you won't see the obvious.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; That's an assumption about 3-D Mind. There are NO &quot;double blind
&gt;&gt; studies&quot;, or indeed any science at all to suggest that 3-D Mind isn't
&gt;&gt; placebo EITHER. And the same issues about it not always working crop
&gt;&gt; up.

&gt; No your entirely right, there has been no studies done, but the fact
&gt; that Dr. Ken, which some clowns on here think is made up, endorses the
&gt; product and the product is structured along the lines of his brain
&gt; model, but again you seem to want to remain uneducated as to how the
&gt; brain actually works. So again all we have is your ignorant opinion.

&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong: I personally think 3-D Mind is a very powerful
&gt;&gt; set of tools that no one should be without. I just don't think your
&gt;&gt; criticisms of what you call &quot;NLP&quot; can't equally be applied to 3-D
&gt;&gt; Mind and it's creators/founders. Sauce for the goose.

&gt; I agree, Tom and Kim do have some flaws but it isn't drug habits or
&gt; murder, broken marriages or lying to promote their products. Sauce for
&gt; the cooked goose.

&gt;&gt; Where are the double-blind studies on 3-D Mind? How can we be 100%
&gt;&gt; certain IT is also not due to &quot;placebo&quot; whatever that actually means?

&gt; There are no double blind studies done on the 3-d Mind, all the 3-D
&gt; Mind has is Dr. Ken, neuroscientist, 25 years experience, I kind of
&gt; have to take his word for it. I mean if your going to take uncle
&gt; miltons word of G and B modeling, I think Dr. Ken's credabilty is good
&gt; enough for me.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The NLP model for modeling excellence works, and keeps improving.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; Who said it was just about Richard? In fact, I refer in this case to
&gt;&gt; Robert Dilts. Read his books; they are almost ALL about modeling
&gt;&gt; excellence. Even your 3-D heroes love Robert Dilts.

&gt; I like Dilts also, he is a very good man, very honest and sincere. You
&gt; have to admire the guy. But it doesn't mean I agree with everything he
&gt; says or teaches.

&gt; (Snip)

&gt;&gt;   All of the criticisms leveled here in the cited quotations are
&gt;&gt;   equally
&gt;&gt; applicable to 3-D Mind. Sauce for the goose.

&gt; Your right except there is a brain guy standing behind their product,
&gt; who's standing behind nlp?

&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.sueknight.co.uk/Publications/Articles/NLP_Plausible.htm
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming

&gt; You just didn't go and read the links I posted did you? Of course you
&gt; didn't. You don't want to hear experts in the fields of say lingistics
&gt; say, nlp is bullshit.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt;  I'm not nitpicking; I'm seeking clarity. In the case of your
&gt;&gt;  statements, a
&gt;&gt; great deal of seeking was required.

&gt; If you were truly seeking clarity, you'd get out of the shitty
&gt; disciplines your into and knock off the airy fairy bullshit and get
&gt; real.

&gt; (snip)

&gt;&gt; I think they are hollaring about more than &quot;NLP&quot; being under fire and
&gt;&gt; as much about marketing issues.  But I happen to LIKE obnoxious
&gt;&gt; marketing, having been one of the main models and inspirations of it
&gt;&gt; for your heros.

&gt; Moot point moving on.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But bear in mind, NLP started out by modeling psychotherapists:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Erickson, Satir, Perls.  Certainly, B and G started out with the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; observation/assumption that these folks were VERY effective or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they never would have modeled them in the first place.

&gt; Yes but they missed the most important element of all, view Dr. Kens
&gt; brain model again and see if you can figure it out.

&gt;&gt;  Both Erickson and Satir endorsed B and G's modeling. Don't know
&gt;&gt;  about
&gt;&gt; Perls; I think he died before they got around to writing any of it
&gt;&gt; up.

&gt; So what, they were good at what they did, it doesnt mean they were
&gt; modeled right, again review Dr. Kens presentation and learn where nlp
&gt; failed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So even there, Bandler never knocked all therapists, did he?

&gt; Who cares

It's like this 'hellwussy' needs to come in
and save the day.  WHY, I have no idea.

I think the public could have more respect for
the marketed item if there was not a cheap laugh
attached to it..but then again, they seem to think
Usenet is a 'market', and spam away..  Sad, really.
