So, what is the best way to concentrait H2O2 to between 70-85% pure
when you do not have acces to a vacuum still? Is it freezing,
steaming, or some chemical reaction?

I'd start with freezing, if only on the grounds that you are less likely
to die.

well if it was even possible to for an individual to buy pure hydrogen
peroxide then I would have done that now wouldn't I, and y would I
want to dilute it then? And if it were possible it would be heck of
expensive. I'm starting with 35% which I can get for an ok price but I
need to get it at least to 70% so that it will be efficient enough to
use as rocket fuel. I plan to biuld a hydrogen peroxide rocket if I
can get the proper concentration of H2O2.

Well I believe it is possible to purchase it at 90% which is stronger
than the 70-85% that you said you need so that is why you would dilute
it.

I have done pretty extensive research to find H2O2 suppliers and no
one had anything better that 50% for comercial paper bleaching. If you
knkow of a company that sales 90% then please tell me. I don't know of

Years ago I had a gallon of 90% from DuPont when I was working there.
They probably still make it but I doubt that they would sell to you as
is the case with other highly hazardous chemicals when you cannot

Main peroxide manfs are Degussa and Solvay
Solvay show a 70% grade.

Don't try to concentrate without vacuum.  It will decompose faster than you
can distill out the water.

I know of no way to make any kind of decent rocket fuel from Sodium.
Unless, of course, you are talking about something as brainless as

They're not, because there are cheapper means: native coal and brin
for indirect redox of any compound, and to use alqalis is another
step.  The question was whether sodium makes good rocket fuel, not
whether we make it with sodium.  However, here are some good compounds
that hold one valence:

weaxes
rubbers
benzene
cubane
pòlucuclorganics
hudrojèn
acetylene
hudronitrile
cuanide
cuanojèn
azide
organoazides
hudrazine
organohudrazines

Do you count oxidisers as fuel?

beyond the usual matchsticks and hobby rockets:

sodium superoxide: NaO2 ~ Na2OO3
sodium ozonide: NaO3 ~ Na2OO5 ~ Na2OO2O3 * Na2OO3O2

(Klorine is heavier than sodium...)
