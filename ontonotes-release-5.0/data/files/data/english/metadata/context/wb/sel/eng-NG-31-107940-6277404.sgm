This Teaching says, "Foul language never won a war."

TEACHING DELIVERED THROUGH FRANCES M. KLUG ON

"Why is there so much emphasis on foul
language in our day? What does it really
gain? Does foul language satisfy the deliverer
or the recipient? Does it give more credence
to what is being spoken about? Does it give
anger more emphasis? If so, why?

We have American dictionaries with
thousands of words, descriptive of every facet
of life, yet people limit themselves to gutter
language to express what they want to say.
To hear it has a shock to the nervous system
because it is many times humiliating and
depicts only an animalistic manner of expression.
It takes away from the respect of one human
being to another. It leaves out a most
important factor, that as human beings, we
are made to the Image and Likeness of God.

Foul language is many times used to
terrorize another person. It is used to express
dominance, brutality, and that the person
using it can be or is a bully.

Foul language never won a war. Foul
language never gave dignity to any man's life.
Foul language does nothing but show the
limited vocabulary, and the limited values,
standards, self-esteem and personal dignity of
the user. Foul language is an insult to human
beings."

It may be the teacher's unions fault, they don't instruct in
the full range of language.  Test are multiple choice and
essays are graded even with bad grammar, misspelled words
and poor or now punctuation.

But another reason may be the versatility of "foul
language."  The F word is very useful and can be used in
almost any conversation to describe almost any emotion,
event or action.
Such as "F you" or "I'm F'ked"  There are many uses for this
most versatile word, so tell someone "F U today."
