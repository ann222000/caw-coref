Hi everyone,

After reading several posts about caning (Thank you Tobie!) my Husband and I
have decided to give it a go. The only thing is, all the canes I've found
online we can't afford;(and living in a small Midwestern town does not lend
itself to a good sex store) so we thought maybe we could substitute a one
inch round dowel rod. The only this is, it has almost no give to it. Do
canes have any give? I'm not real thrilled about lasting harm being done to
me so I thought I would ask the people of SSBB who have more experience
before I bought the rod.

Any replies would be greatly appreciated. I know it's been awhile since I
introduced myself and I've made just a few comments, but I assure you I am
not a troll. I fully understand the sort of "paranoia" that's been going on,
what with all the new posters and all.

Thanks for your help.

Rattan canes are very flexible relative to their thickness.  They should be
quite cheap.

A one inch dowel would *not* feel like one, and indeed could cause heavy
bruising.  I suppose someone must love them, but haven't heard of it.

This said, using a rattan cane to whack someone isn't something one does
without practice on inanimate objects!

IMO you *could* but I think it would be more likely to damage.  And I
have been struck with both.

Canes tend to be whippier, though some thicker rattan ones are not.  For
a beginner, if you like "thud" you could go with a thicker cane or the
dowel, but expect real impact and possible bruising.  If you like sting,
a thinner cane can be like a line of fire (and leave a trail behind.)

There *are* places to get cheap canes or rattan to make your own, but
I've lost track of them.

I would be much more careful about placement of the strokes if you use
something as ungiving as a dowel.

Traditional canes are made of rattan, which is *quite* flexible, depending
on the girth.  It is very, very different than a wooden dowel rod.  That
being said, however, I have been hit with a walking cane in a scene, and it
did "work" if by work you mean it hurt a lot.  The sensation is, however,
very different from that of a cane.

Rattan canes should not be that expensive.  You can get a wide variety from
the Frugal Domme ( http://www.frugaldomme.com/ ) for anywhere from $14 to $22.
I recommend her "light English" and if you want a second one that is plastic
I would recommend the Delrin.

The other thing you can do is go to a plastics store and look for plastic
dowel.  Some people do make canes out of the more rigid plastics, and they
can be interesting too, but for the true cane feel you want a flexible
plastic.

Good luck and happy caning!

(Btw I understand the Midwestern thing as I spent 13 years in Southeastern
Michigan.)

Well, I think dowel is going to be too stiff, but hey, I'm not you. I'd be
especially careful about splintering, lacquer it or something first.

Stiff canes bruise and are not to my liking, thin whippy ones sting and to
me are good. I particular like the way that you don't feel it until after
its hit. There is a moment when you know its too late to avoid that nasty,
but delicious in the best purvy way, sting.

I like Rattan myself, and it may well be possible to buy this and make your
own.

I'd have thought you could order one on line at a reasonable cost myself.

Some here use plastic rods of various weight, but really, canes are canes. I
suppose the archetypical one is, um, cane, but this too splinters and I'd
not want to chance it.

I'm sure there are as many opinions here as there are users though.

Yes, and in my opinion, the thickness in the original post is way too  much.
its more like a round  walking stick thingy than a cane.

I could suggest UK sources, but I don't think it would be that cheap after
shipping.

As has been said, a little practice on some cushions first  is to be
advised, though a thin whippy cane is probably not going to do much damage
unless  you do it to extremes!

Cane should be cheap but as far as I know it's sold in large quantities.
I buy it from a wholesaler at a low price. I stopped making them for
lack of time. I used to sell them for $12, they come with a leather
heandle and rounded edges - there's a pic on my website. They shouldn't
be more expensive than that.

It does matter what type of cane you use. I have experimented with
various types of cane, but you don't want it to be too flexible. I used
a very flexible type of cane (I forgot the name of it) but my
beta test customer started to complain about aiming problems.

Some people think that bamboo is the same as rattan. It's not. Bamboo is
not flexible and it's dangerous because it splinters. It breaks, pinches
the skin, and the sharp edges can cut. Don't use it unless you know what
your'e doing.

Caning is fun. There's a lot of ways of using a cane, and
it's one of the most painful instruments in bdsm, if used properly.
Greenery Press has a nice booklet about caning.

Hey jo, what about those canes that are like a whole binch of tiny
dowel rods strapped together? I can't remember what they're called...

Anyway, it seems like a low cost alternative that you could make
yourself, and would be more likely to be safe--a lot of smaller canes
starpped together would create a hard stinging sensation, but the
overall impact would be even distributed over the entire area, and
wouldn't cause bruising without prolonged use.

Caning is a little out of my experience, but this sounds fun to me.
How about you?

You know, for all that the cane-cultists love to think that their toy
is unique, it's really not.  There are impact toys.  Some are flat,
some are thin, some are rounded, some not, some are stiff, some are
flexible.  The same concerns apply to most of them.  You want a toy
that will hold up, both because if it breaks you have to buy it again,
and because as it breaks--or breask down, it can harm the bottom.  You
want to think about what you like, or at least what wensation you're
going for.  Thin=sting, fat=thud.   This also=whippy, so watch out for
wrap, fat also=dense, so watch out for bones.

So stop looking for something labeled, "cane".  Go to Home Depot,
Michael's, a toy store.  Look for things that are the same shape as
what sounds like will produce the effect you want.

Then, go back home, and let the whomping begin!  Start out with little
bitty taps from a little bitty toy that would bore you to tears within
two minutes.  At some point, you'll turn around and holler at your
top, "By God, if you don't hit me with something pretty soon, I'm
going to hire a Marine!"  Now it's time for him to go a little
heavier, or move to a toy that you think will be heavier.  Either way,
you're only upping the level by about five percent.  Later on, when
you're both more experienced with the toys and your reactions to them,
you can start going from zero to sixty in a matter of seconds, but why
rush the process?

And like Stephanie said, try the frugaldomme--her stuff is great, and
cheap!

Before I was able to get some real rattan canes, I did use dowel rods, but
much smaller than 1 inch diameter!  I think the largest I used was perhaps
1/4 to 5/16 inch.  They definitely were not flexible and could break if
improperly used (hit too hard), so I had to use them carefully.  Once I got
some decent canes, I never went back to dowel rods.

Another temporary substitute for dowel rods or plastic rods are the rods
used to adjust mini blinds.  They do have some "whippiness" to them, but
most are octagonal, so they do have edges.  The good thing about them is
they are just about everywhere and  if you feel like a little impromptu
play, you can just unhook one from the blind.

BTW, have you ever noticed a couples standing at the dowel rod display
"trying them out"?  It always brings a smile to my face.

Cane should be a description, not a label that gets something a bigger
price. I *like* rattan, but I got there after trying tons of stuff and
a LOT of that other stuff is still in my toy roll.

Here are some of the other, less 'honorable' canes in my collection
that goes where ever I'm playing.

Whippy stick that was born as a cat toy, it used to have feathers on
the end of it. I ripped those off.

Acrylic rods, got at least one of them at a craft store.

Two bamboo canes. I suggest wrapping bamboo tightly in electrical tape
and dipping the ends in tool dip.

Other things that work:

Rod from the cutain blinds
PVC pipe
PVC pipe filled with sand and sealed off
Unscrew the mop/broom end and use the handle ( more thumpy, and of
course, don't hit too hard )
fishing poles, take off the 'eyes'
switches cut from bushes ( wear pants )
switches cut from trees
tent pole
medical cane...remove the floor pad

and if you're REALLY feeling froggy....blackberry stalk

It it's firm, if it won't bend too far if you hold it upright, you can
use it as a cane.

Now, to learn to use some of those things, I suggest;

Put baby powder on a darker colored pillow. Start striking it.
Repowder as needed
When you get so that you can hit any specific area of that pillow, go
to a smaller pillow

After that, start putting a penny on the pillow, and then hit it, not
the penny...the pillow.
Learn how to bounce the penny in specific directions depending on
where you hit the pillow.
Can you hit the pillow and catch the penny? *grin*  ( this is a hard
blow with rattan, and I'm sure a much softer blow with a broom stick )

Then learn to hit the pillow where you want to without moving the
penny. Not leaning over, eye measuring and tapping, but look at it,
then whack it.

It's a very different thing, and you won't get the same marking nor the
same intensity of effect.

Not that there's anything wrong with that sort of toy, but it can't be
weilded the same way a can can be, and it feels completely different.
And if canes have a psychological/mental association for the, er,
"subject", then it would also probably not elicit the same kind of
response. (Like with me, a belt is not the most serious implement, by
far, but it can make me cry faster than anything else.)

Take 5 or 7 of those extra thin dowls and cut them all one convenient

Well, short smacking length.

Run them through  a piece of fabric snadpaper and get them super

&gt;overall impact would be even distributed over the entire area, and
&gt;wouldn't cause bruising without prolonged use.

&gt;Caning is a little out of my experience, but this sounds fun to me.
&gt;How about you?
">

In my experience, the more of any one type of thin cane thing you use
at one time to hit someone one with, the more the sensation 'spreads
out' and turns to a thud like sensation when compared to any single
cane thing of the same type.

There is very little aiming with my whippiest thinnest cane.
I can hit *parts* but I can't 'hit that freckle'.  not if I'm actually
hitting someone, with slow taps, sure it's not too far off aim, but if
it's moving fast the slightest breeze with take it half an inch from
where I'd intended it to land.

About a month ago somebody posted on one of my local email lists that
IKEA has a bundle of bamboo (or maybe rattan, I forget the specifics)
rods all tied together that they're selling as a home decor thingie. The
pervert in question immediately took the decorative thingie apart and
voila, he had about 20 or so perfectly sized canes.

The price was $15.

As my gentlespirit is on oxygen 24/7, we have lots of O2 tubing lying
around... old canulas, extension tubing, etc.  One of these days I'm going
to make a flogger or cat out of that tubing.  As it is, we've used the
tubing doubled over as a sting toy... and it did!

That's not 'cane' material though, it's too soft.

If you can find a reasonably priced roll of shrink fit tubing, that also

Hi Jo - you seem to have a great deal of response - - I would sum it
up be saying -try all sorts of things and see how you get on - it is
really important that the sensations are enjoyed by the sub as much as
being given by the Dom(me) - unless of course either the sub does not
want to enjoy, or the Dom(me) is punishing. what ever you try - take
it easy at first until you know that the implement will do.  I like to
use a riding crop - these can be bought cheaply at a tackle store, and
give a lot of control, so I can vary the sensations and the marks.

What ever you do - enjoy and play safe

I agree with an earlier comment about going to a local store.. Someone
said IKEA.... I am in the midwest but we dont have IKEA around here so
we go to Home(Dom)Depot or Hobby(SM)Lobby.   Have found stuff for the
same basic purpose at both also Hobby Lobby has both Rattan and Bamboo
sometimes for VERY cheap you just may need to cut it down

Something I have found to be useful in a pinch is one of those little
plexiglass (?) rods that are used to adjust Venetian blinds. As long as
youre not swinging one full force, theyre quite sturdy and very owie.
Nice marks, too.

Also, you may not have a sex shop in town, but have you considered
Blowfish, the Stockroom or similar websites? I shop at them routinely
and have been very happy with the results. I think there are some cane
makers on SSBB, as well, that sell things. Not trying to push business
for anyone, just offering alternatives.
