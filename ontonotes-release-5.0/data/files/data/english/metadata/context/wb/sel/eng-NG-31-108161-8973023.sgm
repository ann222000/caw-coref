Hello,

I would like to copy rip some of my VHS tapes to avi or mpg files.

I am using a analog to digital video converter which inputs video out
signal from vhs player and outputs on the usb digital signal to the PC

I use Intervideo WinDVD creator 2.0 as software to capture the video
signal input to the PC

Many vhs tapes in some part of the play signal to the software
something like a copyright signal which stops the capturing in the PC
and the recording is halted.

How can I avoid this? what advice you give me in order to copy this
tapes

Thanks

Mario

The reason that is happening is because you do not have
the legal right to copy that video.

All of the analog video converters that I know of either: (1) Ignore that
copy protection, or (2) offer ways to shut down copy protection
sensitivity in the device--except for some models of the old Dazzle
HollyWood Bridge (what a piece of crap that is.)

Roland and Canopus models let you turn it off.  DataVideo models just
ignore it.  Some of the Dazzle/Pinnacle products ignored it but some of
the later models of Dazzle/Pinnacle products would not offer any means of
ignoring it.

If you have one of the Dazzle products, I'd surely try to get a second
job to save some money and buy something else because copy protection is
only a minor problem compared to the other severe flaws of the device.
Those Dazzle/Pinnacle converters wouldn't capture more than 10 to 20
minutes and then they would crash and require a hard restart of the
device.  You'll waste a lot of your life piecing together short segments
of a 90 minute movie if captured by a Dazzle/Pinnacle Hollywood Bridge.

I've got one of the early Dazzle Hollywood Bridges.  Again, let me say--
what a piece of crap.  However, I do use it as a &quot;pass-through&quot; device
that lets me copy material to DVD Recorders.  It doesn't crash as long as
it's used as a pass-through.  It only crashed the IEEE1394/FireWire
connection.  Later models of the device that claimed to fix the crash
problems, unfortunately, also had no way of ignoring copy protection.
Best I know, they also didn't fix the crash problems either.

Generaly true but not always.

1) Not all Macrovision protected tapes are properly copyrighted.  In
20 years some have run out.  Some are even silent.

2) Some tapes are older and it appears to the recorder that they are
Macrovision protected, when in reality they were privately recorded.

Try one of these:

http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/compare/compare_pvr.html

for capturing to the PC.  They do hardware mpeg encoding.

Use VideoRedo's QuickStreamFix for cleaning up any A/V sync issues
immediately after capture.

Then author the DVD compliant mpeg.

Or:

Use one of these between the VHS player and a DVD Recorder:

I apologize.  I'm an idiot.  I missed the &quot;usb&quot; in your post.  All those
things I talked about are &quot;firewire&quot; devices.  Nevermind.

If I needed one of the devices that you need, I would look at one that is
called &quot;Grex.&quot; http://www.xdimax.com/grex/grex.html

They claim that they don't fully reprocess the signal.  They claim they
just whack out the MacroVision corruption from the overscan.  Sounds really
good in theory.  If it's true.

People also use Time Base Correctors (TBC).  Those devices fully reprocess
the signal--usually in a digital form.  It's important to choose a &quot;full
frame&quot; TBC as opposed to a &quot;line&quot; TBC to get satisfactory performance.

TBC's can be expensive.  There's a popular one by DataVideo
http://www.datavideo-tek.com Their model 1000 runs around $300 U.S.

Though the price is right, I'd use caution.  I didn't have their TBC but I
have a DataVideo DAC-100 analog to video converter.  Though it worked, it
used the very same chip that was in the Dazzle Hollywood Bridge.

The chip, was named &quot;DiVIo.&quot;  It interjected so much &quot;mosquito noise&quot; into
the DV captures that I had a terrible time coaxing MPEG encoders into
managing all that injected junk.

I was forced to use the very highest quality settings in MPEG encoders in
order to manage all of that artifact so that my MPEG encodes would take 5
to 10 times longer than you would ever expect.

So?  They've changed the design somehow in that converter and that
converter has a new model number.  Have they changed the chip and
eliminated all that mosquito noise?  I don't know.

However, I do know that their TBC1000 model number hasn't changed.  I've
read in many forums--especially VideoHelp.com that people are dissatisfied
with DataVideo's TBC performance as well because of injected artifact.  So,
it functions as a &quot;stabilizer&quot; but it also forced a lot of undesireable and
objectionable stuff into the mix.

There's many TBC's out there but I suspect that many of them use the same
Taiwan design with a different name.  SIMA has a TBC of sorts and it looks
just like the ones you'll see at: http://www.cypress.com.tw/index.html .
Cypress Technology will sell you the device in bulk and you can silk screen
your name on it if you want to.  There seems to be many companies who are
doing just that.  So, look at the Cypress appearance.  If the TBC you think
you want looks like that, you are getting just that.  I can tell you from
what I've read in other forums, the device will perform no better than the
DataVideo TBC--you might be able to copy the things you desire but you'll
probably find yourself totally unable to tolerate all the other junk it
throws into the processing.

If I needed a TBC, Roland used to have one that is interesting but I think
it ran $400 to $800 U.S.  Look at: http://www.edirol.com I can't find it
there right now so they may have discontinued it.

Most people, I think, settle on the other TBC models because it's about all
that can be had for less than $1000 U.S.

So, I guess if I were you, I'd start looking at Grex in forums to see if
you can discover anyone who will tell you if it works.  If I couldn't find
any useful information, I'd just be ready to plunk down $100 U.S. and buy
one.  It would be worth the risk even on my tiny budget.

Me?  I've got that old Dazzle HollyWood Bridge.  It works fine as a pass-
through device and it doesn't interject that annoying mosquito noise when
used simply as a pass-through device.

When my Dazzle thing breaks down, I'll probably take a chance on the Grex.

Perhaps true, but that doesn't change the fact that it is illegal.

You are free to redefine for yourself what &quot;troll&quot; means.
But you may find it necessary to explain it to others.

If you don't like the news, lobby your congress-criter to have
the law changed.  It will do you no good to complain to me.

Some years ago there was a box called the Bug Blaster which as well as
providing buttons to change colour, contrast etc also sent out a
regular sync pulse to the recording equipment. This allowed you to
copy VHS tapes. Have a search round the net see if there is something
similar.

Just don't be surprised if the authorities come calling &amp; book you for
theft of copyrighted material.

Depending where you are, you are allowed to watch &amp; possibly make *one*
backup copy of a commercially produced programme. In the UK, you are not
allowed to make the backup copy. In the USA, you are not generally
allowed to bypass *any* copy protection mechanism in order to make the copy.

With very few exceptions, you do *not* buy any rights to copy the
material on the tape, you only buy permission from the programme maker
to watch it &amp; listen to it *as supplied*. Legally, the physical tape is
yours, but the recording remains the property of the licence holder.

To change this situation, lobby your political representative.

The black box to clean up a video signal for copying does exist, &amp; has
legitimate uses for copying your own, possibly corrupted, videos. This
is why they're not illegal to buy in most countries. The system you're
having trouble with is probably Macrovision, as that's the commonest
protection on videotape.
