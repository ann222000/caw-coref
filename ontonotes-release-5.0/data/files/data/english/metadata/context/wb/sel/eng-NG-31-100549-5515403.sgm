Just happened to see this clip on MTV, by a UK group called "Feeder", with a
song "Tumble and Fall", has a classic 900 in it.
The clip can be seen at
http://www.video-c.co.uk/featuredartists.asp (click on "Feeder")

Warning: it does not end very well for the 900.

Nice demonstration of the strong front windshield pillars though. Nice
music too.
