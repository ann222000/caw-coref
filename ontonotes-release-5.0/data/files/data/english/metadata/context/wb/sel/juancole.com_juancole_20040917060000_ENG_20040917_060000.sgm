Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in remarks on Wednesday
repudiated the American-sponsored "road map " to a peace process between
the Israelis and the Palestinians. Sharon insists on acting
unilaterally, intends to occupy the Palestinian population indefinitely,
and intends to permanently incorporate much of the West Bank, conquered
in 1967, into Israel, while leaving the Palestinian population
stateless. They lack so much as a passport or a country, many of their
children are hungry, unemployment is astronomical, and their lives are
ruined by a dense network of Israeli roads and checkpoints that make it
difficult even just to go to the hospital.

I am sure that most Americans are not even aware that Palestinians
live under Israeli military occupation and that every day Palestinian
territory shrinks as it is stolen by fanatical Israeli colonists. These
fanatics do not differ in any obvious way from the French colonists in
Algeria, which the French also proclaimed "French soil." But colonialism
is just another word for grand larceny. (Most Americans would be
appalled if the United States suddenly chased all the Iraqis out of
Baghdad and brought in Americans to permanently take over their
apartments and other property, instead. But that is an exact analogy for
how the Israelis are behaving.)

There are several examples in the contemporary world of land-hungry
states attempting to incorporate neighbors' territory into their own.
You have the Chinese in Tibet, the Moroccans in the Western Sahara . . .
and, well it is actually hard to think of a lot of recent such
engorgements. But in each of these cases, the conquering state wants the
people along with the territory. Tibetans have Chinese passports, and
Saharans have Moroccan ones. But Israel isn't giving the Palestinians
Israeli passports. It just wants their land, not them, and sets things
up to try to force the Palestinians out of their homeland. It is an
ongoing injustice, with Israeli colonization creeping forward. Even if
Sharon does remove the small number (8000) of Israeli colonists from
Gaza, he intends to resettle them in the West Bank, which is nicer real
estate.

Charles Smith's Guest Editorial on Sept. 1 is worth revisiting in the
light of these recent admissions.
