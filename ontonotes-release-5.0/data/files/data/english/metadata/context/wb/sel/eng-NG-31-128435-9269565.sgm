Greetings!
Thank you everyone for your calls in support of my son.  The hearing was moved to
Monday afternoon, but many reached him prior.  He is now facing one more court date
in another city.  If you are able to donate to help with transportation costs, it
is appreciated.
Thank you again for all your support.

Action Alert
Calls Needed to Pelosi and Obey ---
They need to hear from us Idiot Liberals!!!!
Demand an Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Troops!
It
appears, from press accounts (see bleow) and conversations with House
staff, that the House leadership (Pelosi and Obey in this case) are
still deciding on the details of a 'bridge fund' for Iraq.

This is an opportunity for us to demand a binding timeline for troop from Iraq.
We could demand that Congress pass no bridge funds for Iraq --
but that would do nothing to force a troop withdrawal, because Bush
could use other money in the Pentagon budget to fund the occupation of Iraq. So
our best bet at this time is to make sure Obey and Pelosi hear loud
and clear that this funding should be used to force troop withdrawals:
Call Pelosi - 202-225-0100
Call Obey - 202-225-2771
Tell
them: any funding for the Iraq war must have a binding timeline for the
immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops and military contractors from Iraq.

Background:
We
don't know for sure what conditions Pelosi, Obey and Murtha are
discussing, but it appears that some of the main points they are
considering are:
- a bridge fund of less than $50 billion
- language about bringing troops home, possibly by Christmas'08 [but we don't know
if they are leaning toward a 'goal' or a strict
timeline, and we can be sure that they are only thinking of 'combat'
troops, allowing for some troops to stay]
- the
funding might include other conditions such as requirements for troop
rest time, and it might also include restrictions on torture
Our
calls to Pelosi and Obey are essential to push them to adopt language
that will require the immediate and rapid withdrawal of all U.S. troops
and mercenaries!
Below are two articles, which shine some light on the matter.
From Roll Call, Nov. 7: (excerpt from a longer article about the overall budget
battle)
Democrats,
meanwhile, planned to take up the $459.6 billion Defense spending bill
combined with a stopgap spending measure Thursday that would keep the
government running through Dec. 14. Democrats also planned to
separately take a separate Iraq supplemental bill that will be loaded down with
strings that likely will include a goal for withdrawing troops by next Christmasand
set the stage for another veto showdown.

The stopgap
spending includes about $6 billion in new emergency spending for the
Gulf Coast recovery and $500 million for recovery from wildfires.

Democrats also are including all the funding President Bushsought for veterans,
but not the $3.7 billion in additional spending
Democrats have included in the separate veterans' bill tied to the
Labor-HHS-Education bill. The maneuver helps inoculate Democrats from
charges that they are playing politics with veterans because they can
point out that they have repeatedly sought to give more money to
veterans than the president, but they are not willing to do so if it
means slicing domestic programs, which Bush has demanded.

The size and look of the Iraqsupplemental bill remained in flux Tuesday, although
House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Chairman John Murtha (D-Pa.)
predicted that it would be less than $50 billion and provide a few
months of funding for the war, tied to a goal for bringing the troops
home.

&quot;By Christmasnext year is the date we'll probably settle on,&quot; Murtha said. He said
the goal is to have legislation worked out with the Senate beforehand
so it could pass the Senate without changes and go straight to the
president.

However, as even Murtha acknowledged, the regular Defense bill allows President
Bushto spend billions on the war for months by transferring funds from
other accounts. The bill also includes more than $11.6 billion in
emergency off-the-books spending for new mine-resistant vehicles headed
for Iraq, bringing to about $17 billion the total Democrats have appropriated for
the vehicles for the war so far this fiscal year.

Murtha and Speaker Nancy Pelosi(D-Calif.) said the war-funding bill will include
some of the same
provisions that they have already sought to pass previously, but they
would not detail their exact plans.

Pelosi
defended the Democratic efforts to end the war, and said she did not
have the power to end it on her own by preventing funding from coming
to the floor, because Republicans could offer motions to recommit that
likely would pass.

&quot;Would that I had that power,&quot; Pelosi said.

House
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) summed up the Democratic efforts to
try to change the course on the war while continuing to fund it at
levels even higher than under previous Republican Congresses.
&quot;Obviously if you don't succeed, you try, try again, and that's what
we're doing,&quot; he said.

But Hoyer
defended moving forward with the Defense bill without strings attached.
&quot;What we have said is we're going to support the troops. As long as the
troops are in harm's way, we're going to make sure they get the
equipment that they need,&quot; Hoyer said, dismissing the idea of holding
up Defense funding.

&quot;It's not an option for us not to support our troops,&quot; Hoyer said.

Murtha said
the war supplemental was kept separate from the Defense bill because
the restrictions Democrats plan to put on the supplemental would have
endangered passage of the Defense measure.

War Funds Absent From Pentagon Budget
By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, November 6, 2007
(11-06) 14:08 PST WASHINGTON, (AP) --

House and Senate negotiators agreed Tuesday on a $460 billion Pentagon bill that
bankrolls pricey weapons systems and bomb-resistant vehicles for troops, but does
not pay for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Republicans said the omission would impose an unnecessary strain
on troops, but the Democratic majority said it wouldn't leave the
military in the lurch.
&quot;We'll take it step by step,&quot; said Rep. John Murtha, chairman of
the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. &quot;The public wants this
war over.&quot;
House Democrats said they were considering separate legislation
that would allot some $50 billion in war spending. Murtha, D-Pa., said
the measure also would likely impose restrictions on the money, such as
demanding that troops leave Iraqsometime next year.

The money would be enough to keep the wars afloat for a few more
months, providing only about a quarter of the $196 billion requested by
President Bush.
The House planned to vote on the two bills on Thursday.
Debate comes as Congress remains deeply divided on the Iraq war.
Noting a decline in enemy attacks, Republicans are optimistic that the
war recently turned a corner and conditions will steadily improve
before next year's elections.
For their part, Democrats are struggling to fulfill an election
mandate to end the war. They lack enough votes to overcome procedural
hurdles in the Senate or override a presidential veto. And while they
are united against the U.S. presence in Iraq, Democrats are split on whether to
cut off money for combat as a means of forcing troop withdrawals.
By dividing the Pentagon's budget in two annual spending
versus war money Democrats will be able to vote against paying
for an unpopular war and still say they support the troops, by agreeing
to the military's core budget.
The approach also puts Senate Republicans in a tough position. If
the House passes a bill, as expected, that pays for the war but sets a
timetable on troop withdrawal, Republicans will have to decide how far
to go to oppose it.
&quot;I don't think people will want to be in a position to filibuster
money for the troops,&quot; said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
Republicans said the Democratic-majority was playing a dangerous game.
&quot;I do believe that Congress would break the Army if it refuses to
fund the troops with what they need now,&quot; said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the top
Republican on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

Stevens said the Army would run out of money by January unless
Congress approved war spending. He suggested adding $70 billion to the
bill for the wars, but Democrats, who control the panel, declined.
&quot;This amendment would send to the president additional funding for
his horrible, misguided war in Iraq without any congressional direction
that he change course. No strings attached,&quot; said Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Congress has approved some $412 billion for the
war there, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Most of the money has paid for military operations, while $25 billion
went to diplomatic operations and foreign aid. About $19 billion has
gone toward training Iraqi security forces.
While the Pentagonspending bill omits money for the war, it does include $11.6 billion
for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. MRAPs are being used by
troops in Iraq to protect against improvised explosive devices buried
beneath the roads.
The bill also funds the Pentagon's major modernization programs,
including $3.2 billion for 20 F-22 fighters and $3.4 billion for the
Army's Future Combat System.
Lawmakers boosted funding for several politically popular
programs, including $900 million for defense health and $980 million
for National Guard and Reserve equipment. A 3.5 percent pay raise for
military personnel also was included, representing a half percent
increase to the president's request.
Appropriators also agreed to $8.6 billion to pay for Bush's
missile defense program. But the amount does not include $85 million
requested by Bush to begin construction on interceptors in Poland as part of a European
missile defense system, which has roiled relations with Russia.

Asheville North Carolina has a newly formed IVAW Chapter.  Please join in support
of Jason Hurd and all the hard work he is doing!!!!
Even if you don't live in the North Carolina area, please go to IVAW.org see what
you can do to help with events they are organizing!!!
Here are a few activites they tentatively have planned for Spring!!!
1. Shut down the Fayetteville recruiting station
Fayetteville has the busiest military recruiting office in our
entire nation and we want to shut it down for an entire week! We will
begin every morning bright and early with a formation of IVAW and VFP
members. The formation will sound off with some catchy slogan as the
office opens for business (I personally like the &quot;War is not a game!&quot;
chant). We will leave a presence at the recruiting station during
business hours every day to hand out literature, advise potential
recruits and peacefully disrupt daily operations.

2. Host a servicemember/veteran outreach fair
We will have professionals on-site from the legal, financial and
medical communities (as well as any other helpful profession) to
provide free counseling and services to veterans, servicemembers and
their families. This event will also include free music, food and fun!
IVAW and VFP members will host the event in order speak about our own
experiences and spread our messages.

3. IVAW presence at Fort Bragg's main gate
We will have a handful of IVAW members displaying a simple IVAW
banner at Fort Bragg's front entrance. This has been done successfully
in the past and garnered an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the
Fort Bragg community.

4. Visit hospitalized servicemembers
We will use this opportunity to visit sick and injured
servicemembers at Womack Army Medical Center. We want to find out if
they are getting sufficient medical care as well as offer our
assistance and support to them.

5. Canvassing local restaurants and businesses
Local restaurants and businesses fill up with military personnel
during lunchtime. IVAW and VFP members will use this time to hand out
literature at these establishments and strike up conversations with
servicemembers.

6. Enter local high schools and colleges
We will request time from local schools for IVAW and VFP members
to speak to students about military service. If the schools refuse to
let us in, we will simply hold vigils outside to make our message heard.
7. Public Forums and Speaking events
We will organize numerous public forums and speaking engagements
throughout each day for IVAW and VFP members to get their stories out
to the Fort Bragg/Fayetteville population.
Again, this is neither an exhaustive nor a finalized list of
events. These actions are merely starting points in the initial
planning stage for this week. Thank you all for your time and I look
forward to your input and participation. You may contact me anytime at jeh ... @gmail.com

&quot;There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so
odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part, you can't
even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the
gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and
you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people
who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the
machine will be prevented from working at all!&quot; - Mario Savio
