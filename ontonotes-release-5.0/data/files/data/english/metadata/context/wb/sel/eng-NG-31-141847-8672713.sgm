True Life: I'm Getting out of Prison

Are you leaving prison after serving your time? What will you be doing once you've regained your freedom? Will you be going home to your family and friends and trying to assimilate back into your old life? Or will you attempt to rebuild your life from scratch in a whole new place?

Are you worried about what the world beyond the fences and walls might have to offer you? Are you afraid to face the people you left behind? How will you handle this new-found freedom and the past you must revisit? If you are getting out of prison soon, MTV wants to hear from you.

If you appear to be between the ages of 18 and 28, and are leaving prison in the next few months, email us at: pri ... @mtvstaff.com with all of the details of your story.

Please be sure to include your name, location, phone number and a photo, if possible.
