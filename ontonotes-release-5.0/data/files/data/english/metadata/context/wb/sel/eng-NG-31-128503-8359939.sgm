Hi

For the info of any Google Microserfs on this board. When trying to
post a blog entry last night, I got the error:

-------
We are sorry, but we were unable to complete your request.

When reporting this error to Blogger Support or on the Blogger Help
Group, please:

* Describe what you were doing when you got this error.
* Provide the following error code and additional information.

Additional information
blogID: 8652627
host: www.blogger.com
uri: /post-create.do

---------

Don't bother telling me what went wrong, because I'm away off to
Wordpress, or I might even roll my own. Blogger sucks the big one
since Google took it over, and you can't even solve a simple problem
such as blog searches not working if the user, like myself, has the
temerity to put his blogs in subdirectories of a server, rather than
all in the root.

If you want something done properly, do it yourself... ;-\
Bye now
