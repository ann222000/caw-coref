He didn't move injured guys down the list.  Besides, he was the last
turd floating in the Garbage Bowl, and took home a cool $20, plus first
choice of pick in this years draft.  Not too shabby.

I saw more on the news last night...it looks like a disaster area in
Fenton...didn't know it was that bad!!!  Wow...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

FENTON - Tony Pasztor stood in his driveway and watched as a crew lifted
huge sections of tree trunks with a hydraulic boom and loaded them into
a truck.  Just 48 hours earlier, the logs were part of two giant maples
that were toppled onto his house by a tornado.  &quot;It looked like a war
zone,&quot; said Pasztor, 46, who was home with his two daughters at 222 S.
Adelaide St. when the twister tore through the neighborhood.  The trees
buckled the wall of his daughter's bedroom, cracked roof trusses and
punched holes in the roof. They also sheared two awnings from the house
and left the garage leaning to one side.  &quot;I'm just waiting for the
adjuster to determine whether the house is livable,&quot; Pasztor said. &quot;It's
just all wait and see.&quot;  The same scenario was happening throughout the
area Sunday afternoon as cleanup continued at a rapid pace.  The
National Weather Service confirmed tornado touchdowns in six areas
Friday along an east-northeast 80-mile line from Eaton County, just
south of Lansing, to near Hadley in Lapeer County.  Across the area hit
by the storms, dozens of houses, barns, businesses and public buildings
were damaged. No serious injuries were reported.

Fenton was one of the more highly populated areas hit by the tornadoes.
A tornado that began in Livingston County's Cohoctah Township struck the
southern Genesee County community as it moved along a 26-mile path,
damaging at least 250 homes and businesses, the weather service said.
&quot;Fenton sustained the greatest amount of damage where the tornado path
widened to approximately one-quarter mile - including the snapping and
uprooting of hundreds of trees,&quot; the weather service said in a
statement.  As of this morning, 83 residents in the Fenton and Holly
areas remained without power, but their power should be restored
sometime today, according to Consumers Energy. Initially, 12,000
customers were without power in the Fenton area.  However, portions of
Grange Hall Road between Fenton and Holly remain closed today because of
the storm damage, Fenton police said.  &quot;It may not be cleaned up today,
but they're putting a dent in it,&quot; a fire official said. &quot;We still have
a mess.&quot;  Fenton police on Sunday canceled a curfew in effect since
Friday night, when the city lost power from downed wires and trees.

No one was seriously injured in the storm, but hundreds of properties
were damaged and some families were displaced.  A man clearing brush on
S. West Street had a fatal heart attack shortly after 8 p.m. Saturday,
police said. He was identified as Samuel J. Allen, 50, of Port Huron.
Police said Allen had come to Fenton to help clean up the storm damage.
Fenton Superintendent Peggy Yates, meanwhile, said all of the district's
buildings had electricity and telephone service and that teachers would
report to their buildings today, as scheduled.  &quot;I am really impressed
with the response,&quot; Yates said. &quot;Within 24 hours, the amount of cleanup
was just incredible.&quot;  The intermediate school and North Road Elementary
buildings received minor damage but are safe for occupation, she said.
An emergency shelter set up in the gym at Fenton Intermediate School
closed Sunday afternoon, as no families had asked for assistance, said
Diane Mills of the American Red Cross.  Relief workers were coming by
for refreshments, though, she said.  &quot;This community is so tight-knit,
they went out of their way to help each other, even if they suffered
damages themselves,&quot; Mills said. &quot;People who got away unscathed were
having barbecues.&quot;

Consumers Energy mobilized 30 crews, five contract crews and eight
forestry crews from around the state to the Fenton area, said Kevin
Keane, area manager for Consumers.  The rapid cleanup resulted from a
well-coordinated response by all the entities involved, he said.  &quot;You
practice for emergencies and hope they'll never occur,&quot; Keane said. &quot;All
that practice paid off this week.&quot;  Cleanup also moved quickly in Hadley
Township, where a tornado carved a path about 250 yards wide, narrowly
missing downtown Hadley.  Hadley Township Fire Chief Kurt Nass said the
storm brought down hundreds of trees and numerous electrical lines and
damaged 53 buildings, including houses, sheds and barns.  By Saturday
night, roads had been cleared of trees, and DTE crews were stringing new
electrical lines, Nass said. Many insurance adjusters planned to come
through the area today, he said.  And as with the Fenton tornado, no one
was hurt.  &quot;A quarter of a mile north, and it would have gone right
through downtown Hadley,&quot; Nass said.

Journal staff writer Matt Bach contributed to this report. Information
from The Associated Press is included in this report.

More than the Tractor Supply Company was hit.  Downtown Fenton was hit
hard, which is 3 blocks from my house.

Has Andy ever paid on or before the deadline? Has he ever paid before rd1 of any TPC?

Sorry to hear about the Tracktor Supply being leveled in Fenton. How close is that to Casa de Kurncz?

I saw more on the news last night...it looks like a disaster area in
Fenton...didn't know it was that bad!!!  Wow...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

FENTON - Tony Pasztor stood in his driveway and watched as a crew lifted
huge sections of tree trunks with a hydraulic boom and loaded them into
a truck.  Just 48 hours earlier, the logs were part of two giant maples
that were toppled onto his house by a tornado.  &quot;It looked like a war
zone,&quot; said Pasztor, 46, who was home with his two daughters at 222 S.
Adelaide St. when the twister tore through the neighborhood.  The trees
buckled the wall of his daughter's bedroom, cracked roof trusses and
punched holes in the roof. They also sheared two awnings from the house
and left the garage leaning to one side.  &quot;I'm just waiting for the
adjuster to determine whether the house is livable,&quot; Pasztor said. &quot;It's
just all wait and see.&quot;  The same scenario was happening throughout the
area Sunday afternoon as cleanup continued at a rapid pace.  The
National Weather Service confirmed tornado touchdowns in six areas
Friday along an east-northeast 80-mile line from Eaton County, just
south of Lansing, to near Hadley in Lapeer County.  Across the area hit
by the storms, dozens of houses, barns, businesses and public buildings
were damaged. No serious injuries were reported.

Fenton was one of the more highly populated areas hit by the tornadoes.
A tornado that began in Livingston County's Cohoctah Township struck the
southern Genesee County community as it moved along a 26-mile path,
damaging at least 250 homes and businesses, the weather service said.
&quot;Fenton sustained the greatest amount of damage where the tornado path
widened to approximately one-quarter mile - including the snapping and
uprooting of hundreds of trees,&quot; the weather service said in a
statement.  As of this morning, 83 residents in the Fenton and Holly
areas remained without power, but their power should be restored
sometime today, according to Consumers Energy. Initially, 12,000
customers were without power in the Fenton area.  However, portions of
Grange Hall Road between Fenton and Holly remain closed today because of
the storm damage, Fenton police said.  &quot;It may not be cleaned up today,
but they're putting a dent in it,&quot; a fire official said. &quot;We still have
a mess.&quot;  Fenton police on Sunday canceled a curfew in effect since
Friday night, when the city lost power from downed wires and trees.

No one was seriously injured in the storm, but hundreds of properties
were damaged and some families were displaced.  A man clearing brush on
S. West Street had a fatal heart attack shortly after 8 p.m. Saturday,
police said. He was identified as Samuel J. Allen, 50, of Port Huron.
Police said Allen had come to Fenton to help clean up the storm damage.
Fenton Superintendent Peggy Yates, meanwhile, said all of the district's
buildings had electricity and telephone service and that teachers would
report to their buildings today, as scheduled.  &quot;I am really impressed
with the response,&quot; Yates said. &quot;Within 24 hours, the amount of cleanup
was just incredible.&quot;  The intermediate school and North Road Elementary
buildings received minor damage but are safe for occupation, she said.
An emergency shelter set up in the gym at Fenton Intermediate School
closed Sunday afternoon, as no families had asked for assistance, said
Diane Mills of the American Red Cross.  Relief workers were coming by
for refreshments, though, she said.  &quot;This community is so tight-knit,
they went out of their way to help each other, even if they suffered
damages themselves,&quot; Mills said. &quot;People who got away unscathed were
having barbecues.&quot;

Consumers Energy mobilized 30 crews, five contract crews and eight
forestry crews from around the state to the Fenton area, said Kevin
Keane, area manager for Consumers.  The rapid cleanup resulted from a
well-coordinated response by all the entities involved, he said.  &quot;You
practice for emergencies and hope they'll never occur,&quot; Keane said. &quot;All
that practice paid off this week.&quot;  Cleanup also moved quickly in Hadley
Township, where a tornado carved a path about 250 yards wide, narrowly
missing downtown Hadley.  Hadley Township Fire Chief Kurt Nass said the
storm brought down hundreds of trees and numerous electrical lines and
damaged 53 buildings, including houses, sheds and barns.  By Saturday
night, roads had been cleared of trees, and DTE crews were stringing new
electrical lines, Nass said. Many insurance adjusters planned to come
through the area today, he said.  And as with the Fenton tornado, no one
was hurt.  &quot;A quarter of a mile north, and it would have gone right
through downtown Hadley,&quot; Nass said.

Has Andy ever paid on or before the deadline? Has he ever paid before rd1 of any TPC?

Sorry to hear about the Tracktor Supply being leveled in Fenton. How close is that to Casa de Kurncz?

He didn't move injured guys down the list.  Besides, he was the last

Your prize is a 8 oz Gatorade. I full bottle would through your kidney's

I found this touching eulogy on truckertotrucker.com...it pretty much
sums it all up, I think...I sure hope there is a Bob Evans in Sarnia
proper so we can share the experience that Billy Bob did...

I was saddened to read that Bob Evans died last week. As a personal
memorial to the king of comfort food, I ate at a Bob Evans restaurant
just off I-71 in Ohio Sunday. I walked past the oversized American flag
flying at half-staff. I joined the crowd of locals in their church
finery, families on vacation, and some trucking buddies for a memorial
breakfast to honor a man who started his career with the simple wish to
serve breakfast to truckers at all hours.

Just after World War II, Bob Evans opened a small restaurant next to a
truck stop in southern Ohio. His sign read: &quot;No beer, just fine food.&quot;
You could get a great farm breakfast no matter what time you pulled in.
The service was friendly, the coffee was hot and rich, and the pie kept
you coming back!

When he couldn't find sausage that he liked, Evans started making his
own, using &quot;all the hams and tenderloins.&quot; It was so popular with
truckers, he sold it in carryout tubs. Over the years Evans built his
business into a retail sausage giant and chain of family restaurants.
Bob Evans was a trucker's friend and set a new standard for truck stop
food. My buddies and I ordered the Farmer's Breakfast with an extra
order of sausage. Just seemed like the thing to do. Thanks, Bob. We'll
miss you.
