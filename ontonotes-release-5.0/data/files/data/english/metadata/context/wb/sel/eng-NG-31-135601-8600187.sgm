Hi,

I want to find the greatest of two given numbers say 'A' and 'B.
The condition is that I should use the IF clause but not comparison
operators like '&lt;', '&gt;','=' etc.
Is there any other operator in COBOL by which we can compare two
numbers.

Thanks!
Aparajita

That would be the &quot;greater&quot; of two numbers; the &quot;greatest&quot; implies at least
three...

No there isn't.

But what you want CAN be done.

a clue: Check out the COBOL SIGN test.

Then think about how a computer is able to make comparisons. How would a
&quot;compare&quot; instruction (on any platform) &quot;work&quot;? If you had to build a
computer, how would you build a &quot;compare&quot; instruction? Given that all you
can do is arithmetic and sign checking, how would you implement a &quot;compare&quot;?

Post your thoughts here, and we'll see how you go.

Hi Pete,
Thanks for your response.
I got an alternate solution,
like this
IF A-B IS POSITIVE
DISPLAY &quot;A IS GREATER&quot;
ELSE
DISPLAY &quot;B IS GREATER&quot;
END-IF.

What is your opinion on the above solution? Or if you find any
limitations or constraints with this code, please let me know.

Thanks!

I use three (3) tests for code:

Yes, you are on the right track.  But the code is flawed.

What happens if A = B?  Your code will incorrectly display that &quot;B IS
GREATER&quot;.

You should seek to understand the code yourself, then you won't need my
opinion (or anyone else's...) as to constraints or limitations on it. Had
you taken my advice and checked out the COBOL SIGN test you could have
written a better solution. HINT: It's not too late... :-)

Read about the COBOL SIGN Test, then see if you can fix it yourself.

Picking up a solution from someone else is only one way to solve a problem,
although it is sometimes a valid approach. Always analyse whatever you pick
up, until you understand it thoroughly yourself. If you don't understand it,
don't use it... :-)

Cheers,

Pete.

Why?     If it is because you don't like the symbols, use the words.

There are ways to solve your problem in CoBOL.   I don't know what
kind of operator you want for this excluding the operators designed
for it.

Not sure why you need this, but perhaps FUNCTION MAX could give you what you
want?

COMPUTE MAX = FUNCTION MAX(A B)

Well, I guess there's no IF in that.

I guess the POSITIVE usage others have given is the answer.

Pete,
Usually I am &quot;amused&quot; by DD's &quot;do your own homework&quot; and don't follow up on
it.  However, when I first saw this question last night, it had ME stumped.
Certainly, it HAD TO BE homework (because I can't think of any &quot;good&quot; reason to
make this restriction in a business environment).  Also, when I was thinking
about it,  I was NOT looking at the original question, so I didn't remember that
the two fields were numeric.  Therefore, I could think of ways to do it with
words (not symbols) and without an IF (using intrinsic function MAX), or with
only = (not &gt; or &lt;); but I couldn't come up with a solution that actually met
the requirement.  I am glad you gave the hint and others more on the solution.

P.S.  To OP who gave

IF A-B ....

This may just be a typo (or my misreading a post),but Standard COBOL requires
spaces around the subtraction sign.
&quot;A-B&quot; is a single data item name, like   ADDRESS-OF-HOUSE
while
&quot;A - B&quot; is an arithmetic expression

Can't use operators?  How about words?  You know like:

If you didn't need to use the IF statement, I can think of a number of
(ridiculously expensive) ways to do it. (I was thinking of these when I wasn't
looking at the original assignment where we knew the items were numeric)

- Create a temp file and SORT it
- Create an indexed file (and see what entry you get first)
- Put them into a table and use SEARCH (I am not even certain this could work)

And then there is my favorite (that actually meets the original assignment)

- use Object Orientation and create a method for comparing two items, e.g.

If whatever::&quot;compare&quot; (Field-A  Field-B)  Numeric
Then Display &quot;Field-A &gt; Field-B)

... where the compare method returns zero if the first operand is &gt; than the
second
it returns spaces if the 2nd operand is &gt; than the first
- it returns high-values if they are equal (so you would need to do a 2nd test)

***

Don't you think THAT would impress the teacher &lt;G&gt;

Normally, I endorse the policy of not doing homework for people.

But sometimes, even if it IS homework, a helping hand, or a pointer in the
right direction does not go amiss.

In this case, I remembered a 19 year old trying to get to grips with the
assembler on a certain computer and to understand the whole architecture and
how it worked, at a time when computers were not part of the scenery and
embedded in the lives of all of us.
It had instructions like &quot;CFM&quot;  (Compare for magnitude...), &quot;CFE&quot;  (Compare
for equality).

The clues came when I looked at the Multiply and Divide instructions
(Macros) and realised they were repetitive addition and subtraction.

Then in a flash of cognition I realised that that was ALL this &quot;wonderful&quot;
machine could do... arithmetic. Nothing more. Everything else was derived
from that. (Later I found out more, and got to grips with the reality of
binary and Boolean operations, which at the lowest level are all that is
required. I once wrote a program (for a bet) which read cards and printed,
using ONLY Logical instructions AND, OR, NOT, and XOR...it was a good
learning experience.)

Nowadays, we've come a long way and both hardware, software, and bioware are
&quot;smarter&quot; than in those far off misty days... but the excitement I got from
figuring how it did it, has never been forgotten and I thought someone else
might benefit from that too.

Sadly, as is often the case today, the OP simply picked up a solution from
someone who was happy to provide it, without really bothering to think about
it.

It seems to me that thinking is no longer &quot;fashionable&quot; and solutions via
the line of least resistance are more the order of the day. I'm not
suggesting we should make our lives more difficult, but thought can often
lead to understanding, and understanding can often lead to wisdom. (Of
course, if you have no place for wisdom in your life then there is no real
requirement for thinking, either... For myself, I find the acquisition of
wisdom by personal growth to be a very useful survival tool... I've never
been conned in a pyramid scam, for example :-))

Around four thousand years ago, before the distractions and pressures of
modern life, TV, movies, travel, entertainment... people used to think.
(Human brains are quite well adapted for this...) They worked out the
distance from the Earth to the Sun just by sticking sticks in the sand on a
beach and observing the shadows. This calculation was correct to within 5%.
No reason for it; they weren't planning on going there, just an
&quot;interesting&quot; intellectual exercise.

Unfortunately, this knowledge and, much more importantly, the attitude that
nurtured it, was lost in the Dark ages and the advent of Religion, which
taught that the Universe behaved the way the Church said it did, and there
was therefore no need for people to think about it. The wise teachings of a
few enlightened people were submerged into commercializing the &quot;Faith&quot; and
the resulting parodies of the original teaching set us back thousands of
years in our development, and are still affecting our lives today. Even in
this &quot;enlightened&quot; age, when we can perform technical miracles, there are
still people prepared to kill themselves and others for the sake of their
imaginary friend, who is more powerful that anyone else's imaginary friend.

As you may have guessed, it is a quiet Saturday here.No one has driven a car
loaded with explosives into the local market, there are monarch butterflies
re-enacting the Battle of Britain around the newly arrived pink blossoms on
my nectarine tree, I can go to the shops with the certainty that my chances
of being shot are less than those of my being hit by a meteor, and the fact
that there is a Salvation Army church on the corner of my street does not
offend my Atheist sensibilities one jot or tittle. (I admire the work they
do.)

It IS possible for us to &quot;get along&quot;.

But we need to think about it.

Bill, it doesn't matter if the operands are numeric or not. It is the
principle of doing &quot;arithemetic&quot; (in the sense that the ALU does
&quot;arithmetic&quot;) on them, and testing the resulting sign that matters.
(Although I really liked Rick's Evaluate approach as well...) It is not for
nothing that the the heart of the CPU is an &quot;Arithmetic Logic Unit&quot;... :-)

&gt; And then there is my favorite (that actually meets the original
&gt; assignment)

&gt; - use Object Orientation and create a method for comparing two items, e.g.

&gt; If whatever::&quot;compare&quot; (Field-A  Field-B)  Numeric
&gt;    Then Display &quot;Field-A &gt; Field-B)

C# has almost exactly such a method... as a kind of &quot;blanket&quot; for cases
where strings need comparison and the usual innate methods are unsuitable
:-) (Fortunately, you only need to use it rarely...:-))

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You're still going to have to use an IF to tell if MAX became A or B -
and, this still suffers from the inability to solve the question &quot;what
if they're equal&quot;.

As to why, it smells quite like an educational exercise to teach the
student that there's more than one way to do things.  :)

Nope. I was not referring to Eratosthenes at all. Had I been, I would have
said so.

Not that it matters, but I was referring to the same people who, 5000 years
ago gave us the current 365 day calendar (based on their astronomical
observations), built instruments to measure time and angles around 4500
years ago, documented over 40 constellations which could be used for
navigation 3300 years ago, had many of their accomplishments claimed by
Greeks, (who they influenced immensely...Aristole acknowledged their
superior Astronomical achievements and Pythagoras was tutored by them), and
passed down across thousands of years, through their closed Priesthood,
knowledge that was lost, destroyed (Clement of Alexandria documented at
least four of their books on Astronomy that were in the famous library), and
then re-discovered centuries later.

No more clues... do your own homework. :-)

This is a really good point.

If you look at the classified ads, you'll see what employers want in
addition to 'technical competence' are three 'intangibles':

First, they all want &quot;communications skills&quot;  - however you want to define
that.

Second, they all want a &quot;team player&quot; - whatever that means.

And, they want &quot;problem solving skills&quot; - another somewhat amorphous term.

While in this case the OP demonstrated communications skills and &quot;team play&quot;
(he *was* able to express his challenge (?) and had no problems accepting
the suggestions of others), his 'problem solving skills' were left
unenhanced.

I have a saying I use when asked the difference between school and Real
Life: &quot;In Real Life, the answers are *not* found in Appendix B.&quot;

But a young man I encountered some years ago had his own take on this: &quot;In
Real Life, *all* problems are 'story' problems.&quot;

I think this thread demonstrates how that young man's view would be
something for the OP to keep in mind.

Well, Gee, I'm sorry you're losing your sense of humour

As it is an umoderated forum there is nothing you can do about it.

I suggest you accept it for what it is; an unmoderated Usenet forum and not
your personal Helpline.

If you post here, there is a risk that your questions will be taken off

Many people access this list for a myriad of reasons. Why is your reason
more important than anybody else's?

As for getting help on questions, I have answered a number of them here
recently. They ranged from sending faxes with COBOL ,to suggesting how
comparisons might be made without using comparison operators (which IS the
topic of this thread).

Actually Roger, I DO prefix topics that are OT with an OT prefix, if I
originate the topic. In this case I didn't orginate the topic and it is
debatable how far off it I wandered. As there are no thought police here to
enforce on-topic postings, and as most of us do adhere to a code of conduct
that is NOT enforced, I suggest you are way out of order with this post.

I'm not sure what I would do if I were you. But I wouldn't be getting
unwrapped about it.

Calm down and accept CLC for what it is. No one is setting out to
deliberately irritate you.

&gt;&gt; Sadly, as is often the case today, the OP simply picked up a solution

&gt;&gt; It seems to me that thinking is no longer &quot;fashionable&quot; and solutions via
&gt;&gt; the line of least resistance are more the order of the day....

&gt; This is a really good point.

&gt; If you look at the classified ads, you'll see what employers want in
&gt; addition to 'technical competence' are three 'intangibles':

&gt; First, they all want &quot;communications skills&quot;  - however you want to define
&gt; that.
">

Yes, many managers confuse &quot;communication&quot; with loquaciousness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second, they all want a &quot;team player&quot; - whatever that means.
">

Usually &quot;someone who will say 'Yes&quot; to all my great ideas, and will not drop
the ball when the rest of us are runing with it&quot; :-)

I have to plead guilty to this in some small degree. I DO look for someone
who I think will &quot;fit in&quot; when interviewing, but it is never an overriding
factor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, they want &quot;problem solving skills&quot; - another somewhat amorphous term.

&gt; While in this case the OP demonstrated communications skills and &quot;team
&gt; play&quot; (he *was* able to express his challenge (?) and had no problems
&gt; accepting the suggestions of others), his 'problem solving skills' were
&gt; left unenhanced.
">

Yes, I was saddened by this. I really hoped he would give the matter some
thought and be more enlightened for having done so. Never mind, I'm sure he
is wiser now than he was before he posted. While he may not have given it
the thought I might have wished for, he certainly gave it SOME thought, so
the exercise was not wasted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have a saying I use when asked the difference between school and Real
&gt; Life: &quot;In Real Life, the answers are *not* found in Appendix B.&quot;

Maybe we should rename this forum as &quot;Appendix B&quot;... :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But a young man I encountered some years ago had his own take on this: &quot;In
&gt; Real Life, *all* problems are 'story' problems.&quot;

&gt; I think this thread demonstrates how that young man's view would be
&gt; something for the OP to keep in mind.

My homework has, at times, encompassed the works of the Babylonians, Mr
Dashwood... but many do not pay them much mind, their learning being the
result of their Priesthood and all that.

(oh... and according to data published by the High Altitude Observatory
the distance to the sun was first calculated somewhere around 250BC by
Aristarchus of Samos (see
http://www.hao.ucar.edu/Public/education/Timeline.A.html#250bc )... but
what do *they* know about such matters, anyhow?)

Speak for yourself (it's a free unmoderated forum... great, ain't it? :-))
I have NEVER been part of, or fitted the description you posit, and I NEVER
will be! While I am very happy to make every effort to prefix off-topic
posts with OT, (And actually do this anyway, if it is me instigating the
topic) I can't promise or guarantee to always succeed.

Don't like it?

Tough. There's a lot of things posted here I don't like either, but you
don't see me whining about it. It is not my personal forum required to
conform to my personal expectations and requirements, any more than it is
yours or anybody else's.

THAT is what makes it valuable, not the fact that there is a shared interest
in COBOL amongst the people here, although that is also pretty important.

OK, here's the deal...

1. I'll take more care about prefixing topics that are OT with &quot;OT&quot;, even
though you can't make me :-), but just out of consideration for the
community here, and because of the nice guy I really am... :-)

2. I'll say I'm sorry to you and Roger for rudeness (and I don't  say I'm
sorry, when I'm not...)

IF....and only IF....

1. Both of you acknowledge the value of free speech  and agree that this
forum should remain unmoderated.

2. You accept it for what it is; an unmoderated Usenet forum, not your
personal Helpline, and accept that sometimes you won't get what you want.

Otherwise, I have nothing further to add on this topic.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Around four thousand years ago, before the distractions and pressures
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;modern life, TV, movies, travel, entertainment... people used to think.

&gt;&gt; &gt; They also used to die a bit earlier.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(Human brains are quite well adapted for this...) They worked out the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;distance from the Earth to the Sun just by sticking sticks in the sand
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;beach and observing the shadows. This calculation was correct to within
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;5%.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Eh?  I believe you are referring to Eratosthenes calculation of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; earth's circumference... and that was closer to 2,500 years ago, not
&gt;&gt; &gt; four
&gt;&gt; &gt; millennia.

&gt;&gt; Nope. I was not referring to Eratosthenes at all. Had I been, I would
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; said so.

&gt;&gt; Not that it matters, but I was referring to the same people who, 5000
&gt;&gt; years
&gt;&gt; ago gave us the current 365 day calendar (based on their astronomical
&gt;&gt; observations), built instruments to measure time and angles around 4500
&gt;&gt; years ago, documented over 40 constellations which could be used for
&gt;&gt; navigation 3300 years ago, had many of their accomplishments claimed by
&gt;&gt; Greeks, (who they influenced immensely...Aristole acknowledged their
&gt;&gt; superior Astronomical achievements and Pythagoras was tutored by them),
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; passed down across thousands of years, through their closed Priesthood,
&gt;&gt; knowledge that was lost, destroyed (Clement of Alexandria documented at
&gt;&gt; least four of their books on Astronomy that were in the famous library),
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; then re-discovered centuries later.

&gt;&gt; No more clues... do your own homework. :-)

Good try, but neither, actually. It is a sad reflection on our view of
History that the achievements of these people is only starting to come to
light. It is partly their own fault because they believed the stars were
Gods and so only the Priesthood were privy to knowledge of Astronomy. It was
sacred, and to publicise it would have rendered it profane. It also enabled
them to predict various events, which gave them power over the populace. No
Religion is going to give away its power base (and put Priests out of
work...and yes, I HAVE read &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; :-)), for the
public good...:-) This one was no exception.

I got my rejection letter from the Clique Membership Committee. It seems CLC is for the
worship of COBOL not discussion of good programming. They also dinged me for posting lower
case code and for mentioning The Name Of The Beast: xinU. They said their ecuminism could
tolerate AS/400, Unisys, even an occasional PCer, but admitting an xinU was asking too
much. They seemed to equate xinU with OO and Wicca.

Maybe MI5 is a typo. He means MIS, the '80s term for the computer department.

That is precisely my point. Free speech is a precious freedom and a right of
ALL. Including the &quot;nutter who posts anti-MI5 messages&quot;.

You don't have to read his posts.

Personally, I will defend to the death his right to post, just as I would
yours or anybody else here.

The answer is not to censor the posts.

The answer is to grow up enough that you can accept or discard whatever
people say, and make your own mind up about it.

I don't visit hate or neo-Nazi sites and I certainly would never support
such people. But I don't want them banned from the Internet, either.

Any circumstance where someone other than me, decides what is good for me,
or what I can or cannot see, erodes my freedom and my rights.  I won't take
that lying down any more than the generations before us who wouldn't take it
lying down, and made huge sacrifices so we can speak freely today.

In life, you may not always hear what you might prefer to, you may not
always see what you might prefer to. Deal with it. The alternatives are
infinitely worse.

Pete.

I don't believe in the Tooth Fairy but I can talk about teeth and fairies,
or even fairies' teeth...

If you have ever seen a Wagner festival where they do (usually over several
days) Goetterdammerung, you would realise why I used the term. It is a
tragic epic with heroes and villains,  a deepening Darkness, and the Good
and the Mighty laid low....just like the death of COBOL...

(I once got dragged along (much against my will) to the famous Wagner
Festival at Bayreuth in Germany... 5 days of Wagner... not my cup of tea  (I
thought...) but she was a pretty little thing and very persuasive. :-) I
actually enjoyed it immensely.
