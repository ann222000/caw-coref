doesn't make much sense.  The whole advantage of an air-breathing
vehicle is that it need not lift the oxygen that it consumes.  But

This is a big problem at high speed, but a relatively minor one at low
speed... that being one of the reasons why HOTOL switched to pure-rocket
mode at Mach 5-6 (the other being growing aerodynamic heating).  Until
then, even the nitrogen actually is useful, because a given amount of
energy produces greater impulse (thrust*time) if it's spread over a larger
amount of reaction mass.

The fundamental problem of (low-speed) airbreathing for SSTOs is not
accelerating the oxygen, but having to handle such a bulky, low-density
oxidizer.  (Air is roughly 1.2kg/m^3 at sea level, and much less at high
altitude; LOX is about 1140kg/m^3 at boiling point.)  The sheer bulk of the
incoming air requires large, heavy machinery, which has to be carried all
the way to orbit.  The complexities of having two different propulsion
systems -- even if they share some hardware -- also add dry mass.  Getting
enough gain from airbreathing to make up for this is challenging.

An important secondary problem is the drag and heating added by flying
low enough to breathe air, rather than getting out of the atmosphere as
quickly as possible.  (Gary Hudson once suggested a rule of thumb:
airbreathing schemes which show an advantage on a traditional vertical
rocket trajectory are worth considering, but changing the trajectory to
make them work better is a lethal mistake.)

There are some moves to deploy hypersonic cruise missiles, potentially
using SCRAM technology. If these were developed for military purposes,
it might be economic to strap a few on as  boosters.

On the other hand, a rocket is only doing about Mach 5 when it leaves
the useful atmosphere, so SCRAM technology is not helpful for this.

It could enable an air launched 1.5 stage to orbit though, but only if
the military pay for the development of the booster.

Here's the discussion in question: * http://tinyurl.com/ynmzvh

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&quot;I wrote:
">

&gt;Incidentally, for Hotol fans, note that the May 1993 issue of Spaceflight
&gt;(the BIS's other journal) broke the story on how the original Hotol engine
&gt;worked -- it has been declassified...

A couple of people have asked me to summarize this, since they don't have
easy access to BIS journals, so herewith a brief overview...

The article is sort of half writeup and half interview with Alan Bond (the
engine man) and Bob Parkinson (HOTOL project manager).

They wanted to build an SSTO, and they thought rocket SSTO was too hard.
Airbreathing SSTOs split into three main categories:

1. turboramjet to Mach 5, rocket thereafter
2. liquid-air engines, aka LACE, again moving to rocket circa Mach 6
3. scramjets

Turboramjets are fairly mundane technology, but they are impossibly heavy
for practical launch systems.

LACE systems use on-board liquid hydrogen to liquefy air as the initial
oxidizer.  Thrust:weight ratio is better, but liquefying air requires
much more hydrogen than you can then burn with the liquid air, and doing
anything with the extra is difficult.

Scramjets look promising, but...  First, they only start working at
hypersonic speeds, so you need something else to get them up to that
speed, and then of course you need rockets again later:  "the Smithsonian
in orbit -- one example of everything".  It turns out that the penalties
incurred make scramjets unattractive if you need a major rocket phase
afterward, which is why NASP wanted to air-breathe almost all the way.
Unfortunately, any particular scramjet shape is optimal for only one
speed, so a scramjet becomes a complex variable-geometry device, and
it is very difficult to make the geometry variable enough to function
from Mach 2-3 up to Mach 20-25.  The HOTOL people concluded that
Mach 13-15 is about tops for a scramjet that will also start at a
reasonably low speed, and this makes them relatively unattractive.

Second, "scramjets have an inherent contradiction -- they demand good
and rapid mixing between the air and the hydrogen, but without disturbing
the supersonic airflow at all!".

Third, intake area must vary over a huge range if the engine is to run
over a wide range of speeds.  To keep airframe loads bearable, altitude
must rise in a way that thins the air out faster than the speed increases,
so the required intake area gets larger and larger.

Finally, scramjet research is extremely difficult.  Confidence in computer
modelling is not high, wind tunnels simply are not up to the job, and
developing the technology with research aircraft would be lengthy and
costly.

"Scramjets do not have an intrinsic performance benefit and even if they
did the cost of engineering the hardware required would be much greater
than the other options.  The demise of the X-30 NASP may be a belated
realisation of this fact."  They may be workable for high-speed *cruise*,
but they are not suited to rapid acceleration, i.e. a space launcher.

So they went back and took another look at LACE cycles.  Bond came up
with three new wrinkles.

First and most important, you don't have to liquefy the air.  Merely
cooling it to a very low temperature (just above liquefaction point)
and compressing it there gets you most of the benefit and requires
much less cooling.

Second, heat exchangers can be made much lighter and more efficient
than previously thought.  (No details given.)

Third, you still need more hydrogen for the cooling than for the
burning, and you *dump the extra hydrogen overboard unburnt*.  Any
attempt to use it (with one exception, see below) turns out to show
a net loss.

"Any hybrid engine must end up being a very efficient rocket for most
of the flight.  I began with a good rocket engine and made it a bad
air-breather.  Everybody previously had done the reverse."

The cycle is a bit complex -- the article has a diagram and detailed
explanation -- but basically hydrogen cools the incoming air, which
is then compressed, used to cool the chamber, and burned.  2/3 of the
hot hydrogen drives the compressor turbine and is then dumped overboard;
the remainder goes to the chamber to be burned.  Airbreathing thrust
is about half rocket thrust.  At Mach 5-6, when the momentum loss from
decelerating the air to near-zero relative speed is starting to wipe
out the gain from airbreathing, and the intake is starting to get
awfully hot, the system switches to rocket operation using LOX.

Since the system starts out acquiring air using a compressor, it can
run even at zero airspeed, eliminating any need for other engines and
allowing much testing to be done in normal jet-engine test facilities.

During detailed intake design, it was realized that the problem of
varying intake area could be simplified if there were provisions to
"spill" some of the incoming air into an exhaust duct, away from the
compressor, at low speeds where a big high-speed intake takes in too
much air.  The spill duct is shaped as a nozzle, to expand and accelerate
the air and recover some of the momentum lost in acquiring it.  At this
point, a small trick was added:  some (not all) of the hydrogen being
dumped is injected into the spill duct, and it runs as a simple ramjet.
This is basically just meant to overcome the losses in the intake and
spill duct; any useful thrust is a bonus.  "The idea was that the
spill ramjet did not have to be very effective, and was not something
requiring extensive ground test development facilities.  Instead we
hoped that it would get 'tuned' during flight development, and generally
give us a bit of extra performance and hence margin."  It would run
between perhaps Mach 0.5 and Mach 4.5.

Hence HOTOL's appearance from the back.  Below the fuselage is an intake,
with the spill ducts at its rear end.  On the back of the fuselage itself
are the main exhaust nozzles, with small dump ducts flanking them.

The bottom line, alas, is that after the British government lost interest,
Rolls-Royce assessed the potential market and concluded that even under
optimistic assumptions it would not sell enough engines to pay the costs
of development.  So the RB545 is dead.  Alan Bond is still pursuing
variants of the idea, and in fact there's an article in the same issue
talking (a little bit) about his newer design concept, Skylon.  I'm not
going to summarize that one; this has already taken enough time!

Those are "suck-in" doors, a somewhat different story.

Efficient operation at supersonic, or even high subsonic, speed tends to
require relatively sharp-edged inlets, to avoid the shock waves that would
form on rounded edges (and the resulting drag).  The trouble is that at
low speed but high power (e.g. takeoff), the engine is taking in a lot of
air and so the flow is converging on the intake from the sides.  With a
sharp-edged intake, that converging flow has to make a relatively tight
turn around the intake lip, and flow separation (with resulting turbulence
and engine problems) is quite likely.

Suck-in doors on the sides of the intake let airflow bypass the intake lip
at low speed, reducing the flow convergence and the tendency to flow
separation.  (The Harrier has particularly conspicuous suck-in doors.)
They're a particularly elegant solution because the pressure differences
between inside and outside automatically hold them closed or open as
required -- they don't even need springs!

People have also experimented with variable-geometry intake lips and such.
The original B-1 had intakes that enlarged for takeoff and landing --
suck-in doors were problematic because the intakes are quite near the
landing gear, and debris thrown up could have been inhaled -- although I
don't remember whether this was retained when the intakes were later
simplified.

Real, true spill doors -- aka bypass ducts -- are found in the intakes of
some high-speed aircraft, e.g. the Blackbirds.  Normally the engine will
inhale only what it needs, with the remainder of the flow turning outward
to avoid the intake (the reverse of the low-speed convergence), but this
flow turning can itself cause problems, especially at supersonic speed,
and it can sometimes be better to inhale extra air and bypass it around
the engine, even though this adds complexity and some drag.

(Jet-engine air intakes are a much more complicated subject than you might
at first think.)

Those are generally called "suction relief doors" rather than spill
doors, at least in the USA.
There's a good set of drawings of what the SR-71's engine's airflow
looks like at various speeds here:

The  aircraft that has a really unique set-up in this regard is the
MiG-29 "Fulcrum" Massive suction relief doors are located on the
aircraft's top above the intake trunks:
http://www.militarypower.com.br/avi-Mig29-01.jpg
These open during takeoff and low speed flight. During the takeoff roll
doors  drop down into the intakes sealing them off from FOD problems
till the aircraft begins it's takeoff rotation, then fold back up into
the roof of the inlet.
http://www.moscowadventures.com/wallpaper/1024x768/MiG-29.Taxi.jpg
http://www.plasticwings.hu/mig29/inlet1.jpg
The Su-27 uses a similar system, but in its case the suction relief
doors are on the bottom of the intake trunks, which seems a bit
counter-intuitive in regards to FOD; you can see the doors in this view
of a slightly damaged Su-27 at an airshow:

The Harrier submarine came about as an offshoot of their "Skyhook" project.
In this idea a Harrier would be equipped with a female half of a docking
system on its top at the center of gravity; a crane-like unit would be
able to pick it up and hold it up in the air while it revved up its
engines and flew off:
http://www.vectorsite.net/avav8_3_06.jpg
On returning the process would be reversed.
Here's a sub with some "Thunderbirdish" looking VTOLs on it:

Yep.  But variable intake lips, for dealing with the low-speed

Skyhook, there's a blast from the past! They spent of lot of time on it
and even got as far as mocking up the docking mechanism and hovering a
Harrier T2 around it (whether or not it ever connected with the hook, I

Have some pics somewhere from my schoolboy days Flight International
stash. In the mid '80s Skyhook was being bounced around as a way to
mount harriers on destroyer sized vessels such as the 'S-90' short fat
(can we still say that?) frigate design. Ah well 'twas a nice idea
while it lasted (bit like the S-90 itself!)

Love that album...absolutely LOVE that album.
"They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made... massive metal
things on legs that walked... giant machines...they attacked us... they
wiped us out."
"Machines?"
"Fighting machines...picking up men and bashing them against trees...
just hunks of metal...but they knew exactly what they were doing..."
You know, it's very fashionable to get down on Tom Cruise these days,
but around the time that city block wide area starts rotating, and the
street caves in... and that huge mechanical leg comes out  of the crater
and smashes the pickup truck flat, as the war machine starts rearing up
and revving up its internal power supply as the dirt falls off of it...
that is a _classic_ scene from the history of science fiction films.
My fave scene from that movie still is:
"Want to get its attention?
Why not throw a hand grenade straight at its forceshield?
Will that get its attention?
Yes it will.
Look, it's turning around to look at you.
It's noticed you exist.
Lucky you." :-)

You can see one advantage to it - you don't get gas re-ingestion into
the engine, so you could finally get some plenum chamber burners on the
two front nozzles. IIRC, during tests they found out they had a hard
time getting enough lift due to the lack of the rising air column under
the aircraft like it had on a ground liftoff, and was pretty much the
end of the project, because it really cut into its useful mission
payload. At the time this was considered a bit embarrassing, as they
should have foreseen the problem earlier in the program.
Not as embarrassing as the XFV-12 though, which apparently completely
refused to take off in a VTOL mode.

To be fair, wasn't one of the problems the fact that HOTOL used a

It was just a ducted rocket. The performance (delta-v) was about the

Performance-wise ducted rockets (and ramjets) don't get you anywhere-
the extra Isp of the duct gains you quite a bit early on in the burn,

Stick a precooler on it, and it might work; that would reduce the weight

They got very good at solid-fueled ramjets; they made a solid rocket
propellant that was very low in oxidizer content so that it would only
burn slowly but the exhaust products of its combustion would the mix
with air brought in through ducts on the vehicle's exterior and undergo
secondary combustion to generate thrust. They first used used this
technology on the SA-6 "Gainful" SAM, and have incorporated it in other
missiles since then.
What was really clever about the SA-6 was that it used a solid fuel
rocket motor built into the ramjet duct; once this had burnt out its
casing formed the inside of the ramjet's exit nozzle.
