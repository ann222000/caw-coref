Not sure where to post this???

I have some old, worn, rustic linoleum.  Some of it looks like it's
pressed onto a rough burlap / type material.

I'd like to stain some hardwood plywood, and &quot;mount&quot; the linoleum
pieces to it.  Then put some sort of coating over the linoleum.  These
will be hung on the wall.  Here are my questions:

How should I &quot;mount&quot; the linoleum to the stained wood?  Some type of
spray adhesive?  Can I use Polyurethane to mount it?

How should I &quot;coat over&quot; the linoleum?  Will Polyurethane work there
too?  I could poly the wood and linoleum in one shot?

How about that stuff that you can put items in, so when it dries, it
looks like they are &quot;floating&quot; in the solid.  I've seen tabletops like
that.  Might that stuff work?

Thanks for your input...

Linoleum is still made today, and is an all-natural product.  The
'burlap' you see on the back is jute.

I wouldn't put a coating over the linoleum because it will eventually
cause it to discolor.  Leave the top be.  Mount it in a picture frame
(sans glass) on the stained plywood.

Your welcome.

Howdy!

Oh, for corn's sake, why not post it here?
C'mon, have you not noticed how many posts that are NOT quilt-related
show up here?

Many of the quilters here are also into woodworking, remodeling,
home improvements, painting, flooring products &amp; projects, and a couple
even know what linoleum and polyurethane are.   So why not ask here?
Here, where we like to think of ourselves as one of the friendly spots
in the big wide online world?   ;-)

KathyA-- you got any advice on the lino-to-wood question?
Woodworker/Quilter John--what say you?

And to jwill: are you cutting the lino into shapes to attach to the
wood so that the stain would show thru'?  Otherwise, why stain the wood?
What's your intention w/ the polyurethane?  Do you really need it?
How much wood will show up under/between/around the linoleum?
Will you end up w/ a lino-quilt pattern on wood?   Can we see pics?

My 2cents is that if you cover the linoleum with any finish it will
darken over time and then possibly flake off. What you think of as
floating in suspension is probably Polyurethane bar top finish. You
have to make a dam around the edge of whatever to hold the poly liquid
and then you fill up the damed area and then place the item in the
middle of the suspension of liquid. I have not done to much of that
sort of thing but that is what I know of the process.

I'm sorry Kate, but I don't agree with this rather rude remark.  Today's
posts are about stoves, vacuums, woodworking, so where's the harm.  Besides,
he said he wasn't sure if this was the place.
There's room for everyone.  Plus always the possibility that someone could
steer him to the right place.

No chit Cherlock! Advise here seems to range from de-fleaing the dog and
auto repair to major surgical procedures and relationship issues, once in
awhile we even talk about quilts!

I helped a friend &quot;float&quot; a bunch of stuff that was in her late father's
dresser &quot;junk bowl&quot; in a coffee table. After working with her on this
project we decided it now ranks right up there with good friends helping
friends hide bodies. It's a lot of tedious, meticulous, very precise work.
To keep that linoleum from turning dark you'll have to seal it first, per
instructions, and the nature of the beast will most likely turn color over
time just from exposure to light. You'll have to seal all the wood first
too, per the instructions and dam* it as well. Once you are into this
project you'll replace the * with an 'n'. The stuff you use is a two part
epoxy resin that needs to be mixed and worked with as if you were making
rocket fuel in a sterile surgical environment. It's touchy and the least
little mistake, air bubble or specs of dust will screw everything up. There
are no shortcuts and you can't hurry things along.  We had to do close to a
dozen pours, I can't remember exactly now, but it took a long time, as in
several days, to make things look like they were suspended at different
levels. The trick was to let each pour harden but not cure so we were doing
a pour about every 5-6 hours around the clock. We essentially made a paper
weight in this coffee table, it was probably close to 1 1/2 - 2 inches deep
when we were through. I found a link that glosses over ( oh goody,a PUN!)
the procedures and then you'll know what you are in for.

BTW, when we were done that table looked awesome *BUT* it was a lot of work.
Good luck!

I would have agreed if this was a regular poster... but this person has no
previous posts... nor was it marked OT -- although clearly it is.

Guess we have officially opened the forum to anything about anything... from
anyone....  anytime.    I guess I'm in the minority about opposing that.  I
have no problem with occasional OT posts from regular posters... but this
isn't what this was.  I'll be happy to agree to disagree.

I see your point, Kate (not that you asked me, of course) ... the
person didn't follow netiquette by warning &quot;OT&quot; and doesn't even seem
to be paying any attention to subsequent posts (hint, hint, OP - a
&quot;thank you&quot; to those who offered advice would be nice).

I admit that I've oft forgotten the ol' &quot;OT&quot; warning from time to time,
but I don't recall ever asking a question and not being appreciative of
others taking the time to respond ... THAT'S what I'd be irritated most
about, personally.

But I think the mild chastising you received was other people thinking
&quot;Oops! I may have done that or made that mistake when I just started
out ...&quot;

Just my two cents (Hey! If we put our two cents together ... well,
we'll have four cents!) :)

&gt;How should I &quot;mount&quot; the linoleum to the stained wood?  Some type of

Bad choices both, they will peel.  What works best for mounting
linoleum is linoleum cement.  I have used epoxy for making blocks in a
pinch, but I have seldom kept linoleum blocks for extended periods so
couldn't inform you as to how well that holds up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;How should I &quot;coat over&quot; the linoleum?  Will Polyurethane work there
&gt;too?  I could poly the wood and linoleum in one shot?

If you need to gloss coat your work you would likely be better off
throwing a sheet of glass or plexi over it.  Coatings do not generally
stick well to linoleum, or they damage it.  You could use a wax
medium, but you are not going to get a high gloss out of something
like that.

&gt;How about that stuff that you can put items in, so when it dries, it

&gt;that.  Might that stuff work?

Casting resin.
Linoleum was never made to cope with full immersion in those kinds of
solvents.  I would be very dubious as to how well it would survive the
process.  Plus you would have to choose what kind of resin, consider
shrinkage, exotherm, number of layers, calculations of catalyst, how
best to frame it in, various finishing techniques, etc.

If you are bound and determined to give it a shot, I would contact the
guys at Douglas and Sturgess ( www.artstuf.com ) and ask them for more
info.

You might also inquire on rec.arts.fine
Most of us over there paint, but there are some sculptors, print
makers, and mixed media people who might have more complete answers
for you.
Just ignore the &quot;the only real art is realist&quot; troll.

I would go to a good flooring store and talk to the staff with the
most experience, and then stop by a restoration place, too, if one is
available to you.  Of course, if you have plenty of the old lino, why
not take some small pieces and experiment?

Normally a good plan.
However unless he wished to wait a year or several, experimenting on
little bits would give no clue as to the archival stability, unless of
course everything went to heck instantly.

Artists have been bitten in the butt by chemical reactions that take
place over extended periods of time for quite a while.  Not all
disasters are as immediately obvious as say for example DaVinci's Last
Supper.

Nah, I just read a lot.
