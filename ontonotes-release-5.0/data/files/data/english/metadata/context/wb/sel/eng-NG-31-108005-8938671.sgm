Does anyone have the Sharon Schamber book Piece by Piece Machine
Appliqué?  If so have you used her turned edge technique? Did you
use her products.  I am really wondering about the appliqué foundation
paper she sells.  Is there an alternative that might be easier to
locate?
If you haven't seen it the book is really nice. It has several techniques
that are very well explained.  Photos of some of her wonderful quilts
and also the complete pattern for one of the award winning quilts.
I was able to read it cover to cover at jury duty.  It brightened an
otherwise long wait.

If you can find the wash away fiber stabilizer for machine embroidery...it's
the same stuff.  It feels like a good stiff paper stabilizer until it's wet,
then the glue holding it all together dissolves just leaving the little
fibers behind the applique.  I took a class from her recently.

I am recently an avid fan of Sharon Schamber's work! Join her email list on
her website and she will send you two free patterns from that book, as well
as a (free?) training video that I believe is on her website. I also just
purchased her Feathers and Piecing videos online (NAYY) and it was the best
$8 that I ever spent! I bought some her foundation thru her daughers website
(better shipping prices than Mom) and was truthfully not very impressed with
it. I understood that it would &quot;poof&quot; after getting wet, but it just doesn't
do much of anything so far. I do love the book though and use a version of
her applique method in my teaching and it works great. Also, watch her prep
info about preshrinking freezer paper - invaluable stuff and all free!

yup, i'm on her email list.
when i got the two free patterns link to download, one of them was 67MB.
that is too big for me to deal with on dial up, would take better part of a
day...
more if i'm gonna be surfing and online doing other stuff at the same time.
i'll have to live without it i guess.
you'd think it wouldnt be that hard to split the pattern into at least a pix
of it alone, then the rest into smaller units as well.
i can not figure out why it has to be so big.
shrug,

Do you know the brand name of the stabilizer?   I did buy a roll of what
I thought might be used and then returned it to the quilt store as I wasn't
sure it was the same item.  Would like to be able to try it out and not
spend $12 again on a whole role .  Thanks,..Mary/VT

I think expecting a &quot;poof&quot; isn't realistic.  There will just be a few fibers
under the applique, certainly not enough to puff it out in any way.  I'm not
coming up with the name of the stabilizer.  I'm almost certain it's the same
on Ricky Tims uses for his bobbinwork technique.  I'm pretty sure he gave us
the name of it in his lecture, but I can't find my notes!!!  I know a few
people here have taken his seminar, I bet he gave them the name too.  It's
something like H2O BeGone....but don't quote me.  There are several kinds of
this stabilizer and both his and Sharons are really stiff....some are rather
soft and flexible.  I'll keep looking.  Darn.  I can &quot;see&quot; the paper...I can
&quot;see&quot; my handwriting.....where the heck is it?  Yes, Pat.....I looked under
my cutting mat!!  :-)

I think the stuff I bought (or thought I was buying) is a bit different.
When I read about the foundation product in a recent magazine (QNM? or maybe
AQS)), she specifically mentioned having this stuff specially made just for
her and only available from her (and her daughter). Supposedly, the stuff
was like hand made paper, and was compressed layers of a batting material,
and would expand when wet, forming a sort of light weight batting inside the
applique pieces. The applique foundation that I received is quite different.
Still pretty heavy &amp; a bit stiff, but no puffiness after wetting. I also
bought both weights. So far, I've just tried dampening small squares and
also gently rinsing in a dish soap bath. Maybe something different will
happen when it is actually washed and agitated inside the quilt. I'll keep
you posted (pun intended LOL). ~L

Jeanne, maybe check again on the site. I seem to remember that she sent out
another message about the problem of the sizes, smaller files, smaller
pieces or something to that effect. Or maybe she just figured out how to
compress them better. The patterns are beautifully done and I felt well
worth the time. ~L

Hummmm, I took the applique class from her in April and she never made it
sound quite that raised.  Interesting.  I get both those magazines....I'll
see if I can look up the articles.  (Yeah, sure....like I could lay my hand
on just the right one!)

Yeah, I just tried it also and was redirected to some web site provider to
register a new site?!?  I read something about her changing some things,
like maybe switching to a paid membership site, or an additional paid site
for some features. I'll send them an email and let you know what I find out.
I am not that active within her group, I just read the messages that get

I got an e-mail from them on the 18th saying that the site was 'nearly
ready'. I presume that they actually opened their site before they had
sorted things out properly, and then decided to get it ready 'behind
closed doors', which is what they probably should have done in the first
place!

This was at the bottom of their e-mail:

'Sharon, Cristy and Neil will be in Houston at the end of this month
(Oct.) and would love to meet any of the members. They will have a booth
by the front door so stop on by and say hello'.

so perhaps someone who is going might have time to see them.

Talking of Houston - does anyone hear anything of Tina - she has helped
at Houston for the past 2 or 3 years hasn't she, but then she
disappeared. She had health problems, and I often wonder.

Oh good - give her my love wont you. Her health must have improved a lot
if she is now able to work full time - she seemed to have so much mental
energy, but just lacked the fitness to carry it through. Glad thats changed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; provider to register a new site?!?  I read something about her
&gt;&gt;&gt; changing some things, like maybe switching to a paid membership site,
&gt;&gt;&gt; or an additional paid site for some features. I'll send them an email
&gt;&gt;&gt; and let you know what I find out. I am not that active within her
&gt;&gt;&gt; group, I just read the messages that get sent out. Let's hope it just
&gt;&gt;&gt; a temporary glitch.

I am still alive and kicking Sally - thanks for inquiring!  It's been
a busy and hectic year.

Finally got my oldest graduated from high school.  I was going to
school at the same time.  Went to school all summer and graduated at
the end of August with my Paralegal Certification.  I had a job in a
law office two weeks before graduation!  I wasn't exactly ready for
that, I didn't even want to look for a job until I was finished with
school.  But all things work out for the best.

Speaking of which, having the second income and time OUT of my house
will turn out to be for the best come next June....................

I will be a GRANDMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, Ash and Alex are going to make me a grandma.

Bill is doing wonderfully.  Finally adjusted to the new neighborhood
and new school and is taking off great guns.

And yes, Festival is just right around the corner and I haven't even
gotten to sew all year.  I did a short (emergency) stint with Billy's
John Deere blanket right up until my machine died and everything has
been sitting right where I left it since that day!  We will make it to
the Festival on the weekend, I promised!  But I won't be working the
show this year.  But my daughter will be!  Breaking her in right, eh?
LOL

Anyway, health is relatively good most days and I'm still around, just
busy, but I think of you all often.  I do miss you guys.  I will try
to stay in touch more often and will definitely log in to report on
Pati when she gets here. &lt;EWG&gt;

Hugs to all!
Tina

That was a quick reply Tina! Congratulations on the graduation(s) and on
your new job, and also, of course your elevation to Grandma!

You'll have to get that machine mended - you need baby quilts!

Lovely to hear from you again.

Really great to hear from you, Tina.
As Sally said, we do worry when we don't know whether it is 'busy-ness'
or 'health' keeping our friends from joining us.

If you are going to be a Grandma, I think you will have to start
entering glamorous grannies contests - the extra money will be a bonus
&gt;g&lt;.
Glad all is well, especially about your job and Billy.  Hope your Mum
and her little dog are still doing OK.

I've only just seen this post for some reason, Tina! It's great to &quot;see&quot;
you again! :) I'm delighted to hear that you've finished school; money
coming *in* is so much nicer than money going *out*! LOL.

Congratulations on the upcoming grandmotherhood! I hope all goes very
smoothly in that department -- easy labor, cooperative baby, etc. &lt;G&gt;

I see &quot;Billy&quot; is now &quot;Bill&quot; -- we have a nephew who made that transition
in high school, and it's difficult to get used to at first. &lt;g&gt; I'm so
glad to hear that he's doing well! Is he still interested in quilting?

Have you checked on the Yahoo Houston list for our group? We're trying
to figure out when/where to meet up. I'll be in a class all day
Saturday, but I should get time off for good behavior/lunch. ;)

Hey..... I resemble that remark!!!  &lt;VBG&gt;
I will be loning it most of this trip so who knows what will happen. &lt;G&gt;
But this year I will be renting a car, and have a better cell phone. &lt;VBG&gt;

I will &quot;encourage&quot; Tina to check in and perhaps post a bit while I am
visiting. &lt;G&gt;

Pati, in Phx who needs to get a move on to finish the running around
today so I can pack and finish up everything tomorrow. &lt;G&gt;

Pati, in Phx.......heading out for Cerreta's Chocolates, the PO, the
sewing machine dealership (to pick up the machine I went to pick up on
Fri.) and various other points.........)
