To:  rec.audio.high-end

I just come across this &quot;brand&quot; while browsing eBay to see what was going
for auction in the high-end speaker category.  I looked further into this
brand (by going to their website) to see if and how legititmate they are
because their &quot;S500&quot; model looks suspiciously similar to the B&amp;W 801D.
Their website is well done as far as graphics are concerned.  However, by
reading the product info on their site, I get the impression that they are
more into selling their product over providing info about it.  It just
appears that they are detatched from the music aspect of high-end audio.

Are they legitimate speaker company, worthy of being sued by B&amp;W, or just a
mirage?  Any light shed here would be much appreciated.

Best regards,

-DJ

I don't know how legit you can be if you quote a speaker frequency
response of 20Hz~20KHz  ( ±2dB).

It seems unlikely that they make them on Avenue J in Brooklyn.

Ultimately the goal of every company, by the way.

What would be the basis for such a suit? Are they using
B&amp;W patented technology without license? Are they claiming
it IS a B&amp;W? Have they copied the crossover? Are they in
posession of and utilizing any B&amp;W proprietary business,
financial or technical information? Have the defamed B&amp;W
in any way?

There's not very much left in the realm of speakers that
can be considered unique, innovative or such that a
manufacturer can lay claim to any exclusivity that would be
the basis of a lawsuit.

Of course, in America, we have the inalienable right to sue
anyone at anytime for any reason whatsoever, even if it's
stupid.

But, beyond that, it's interesting to note that the website
makes NO description of who is involved, any unique
features or technology, and so on. There's an address
in Brooklyn NY and that's it: no names no nothing.

As regards this particular model, two sentences on the
web site are particularly revealing:

&quot;The S500 was designed using advanced research
and highly developed audio technology and techniques.&quot;

This sentences says absolutely nothing whatsoever of
any substance. What &quot;advanced research?&quot; What &quot;technology
and techniques?&quot; Solving what problems and how well?

The second:

&quot;Due to the high cost of building this particular model,
all sales are final and non refundable. This model is
exempt from our 14 day return policy.&quot;

Now, is that a deal that YOU would want to be on the
receiving end of? Do you want to drop $12,000 on something
site unseen and unheard with NO recourse?

I don't know how legitimate they are, trying to sell a line of speakers for
pro audio, with a maximum SPL output of only 35 dB! ;-)

Also, stage monitors weighing in at close to 100 pounds (42 KG)  have IMO
questionable utility, except as door stops.

These are probably manufactured in China. Here in Los Angeles we have
SPeaker City. They sell raw drivers, crossover parts, stc. as well as a
line of really nice looking, well constructed , slick, speakers. All
made in China.

Hi, I work for magton audio technics. The particular S500 model is
being discontinued due to the high cost of building and the risk
associated with returns. Being a new company we would like to offer
our customers the ability to return an item if it is not to their
liking. In addition we have partnered with several prestigous
companies around the world that produce high end audio equipment for
professionals and home entertainment users as well.  The products we
offer are indeed top notch and offer the kind of unique style and
design not found anywhere else.  We offer a 14 day return policy on
our equipment where the customer may contact us within 14 days of
receiving an item to return it for a full refund.
Thank You

The &quot;risk associated with returns&quot; is something that every
successful company builds into their business model
and manages accordingly.

They may well be. However, your website is so woefully
short of information that it is impossible to come to such
a conclusion simply by reading it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and offer the kind of unique style and design not found

Aside from style, what is it about your products' design
that is, indeed, &quot;not found anywhere else?&quot;

Excepting, of course, the particular models under discussion.

Without any more details, it would seem that with these
particular models, you are asking the purchaser to assume
ALL the risks YOU incurred due to the high costs of
building and returns. That does not seem to be an attractive
proposition for any purchaser: your company made the
judgements that led to that end, why is it the purchaser's
responsibility to assume the consequences? What's the
upside for the purchaser in such a deal?

In a visit to their website this morning, just about every
single model they advertise comes with the statement:

&quot;This item is currently out of stock!&quot;

That begs the question of how effective a return policy is
when everything is out of stock to begin with. Further we
find the following notation on just about everything:

&quot;This unit is available on a per order basis only.
After an order is placed for the sale item it is built
brand new in an advanced state of the art lab and
shipped off to its buyer. Customer must allow up to
14 business days for delivery.&quot;

I have seen companies that have a regular product line
which they have in stock and ready to deliver, with maybe
one or two rarified, semi-custom models manufactured
on a by-order basis, but I think this is the very first time
I have ever seen a company do this for their ENTIRE
product line.

That would seem to suggest that Magton, as a manufacturer,
simply doesn't exist. I would posit that Magton, if there is ANY
substance to the company whatsoever, is having the stuff
made in one or more of many mainland China-based
cabinet makers. There have been, over the last have decade
a number of cabinet manufacturer that have popped up out
of nowhere doing these kinds of cabinets and stuffing drivers
in them.

So I would posit that our &quot;advanced state of the art lab&quot; is,
in fact, a generic box manufacturer in China, and that there
is unlikely to be any sort of technical substance behind the
company. At its best, it's a shell marketing office. At its
worst, who knows?

Would our correspondent be willing to shed light in the form
of real information on this company, such as the names of
the principles and such?

Given that these speakers are offered with a whole 14-day warranty -
one of the best warranties I have ever seen in 37 years in the audio
hobby, given the extremely detailed information on their website...
well...

Why not cut to the chase. I expect this line of speakers will soon be
distributed world-wide via the traditional White Van SpeakerGuys
Company once they have established some level of 'buzz' over their
products.
