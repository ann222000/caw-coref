Someone who has some spare time today and likes to know everything about
Vegas, I have a task for you...

A bet has been made...I need to know if you sneakily win money in Vegas
as a minor and the casino later finds out you are under age do you in
fact get to keep your winnings (no matter the amount) or are they
confiscated from you???????

You may begin!

Please limit the general questions posed to this forum to scientific in
nature and that will better the human population as a whole. Such as How
many Kurts hottubs would I have to eat to match the fiber content of one
bowl of Colon  Blow?

What is the time frame Nathan?  Has the said minor left the casino
vicinity?, the county?, the state?, the country?  How young is said
minor both at the time of actual winnings and the time of the casino
finding out?  Was said minor you?  Will you touch my pee pee?  Is the
casino on Fremont Street or Las Vegas Boulevard?  Does said casino
serve shrimp cocktail fresh or do they fill it with imitation crab
meat?  As far as the amount, whatever the policy is, I am sure it
applies the same regardless of the amount.

Well, I tired, I can't find an answer...based on some info I read in
message boards, it would be hard for them to take you &quot;winnings&quot;
because, how do they know what money is &quot;yours&quot; from out of your
wallet, and what you &quot;won&quot; or profited at that point, and a casino
just can't come up to you and take &quot;your&quot; money.  Sounds like, once
the money is in your hands, they can't take it back.  But, if it is
something you have to claim, they don't necessarily have to give it to
you.  Like if you hit a jackpot, and you have to fill out tax forms
before they pay you, you probably ain't getting the money.

I don't know if there is a definitive answer about this, probably done
on a case by case basis, but I have no evidence of if it is fact or
fiction.  Maybe you should call a casino, say you are a journalist
trying to do a story on underage gambling and ask what happens.

The Internet is flooded with underage gambling articles, but most have
to do with Internet gambling.  This is the best underage article I
could find, though it doesn't tackle the exact problem, in is
interesting none-the-less.

Sounds like you will have more problems then worrying about your
winnings these days :

per Las Vegas Journal Review article - July 16th:

JANE ANN MORRISON: Underage gamblers could lose their shirts and face
misdemeanor charges

Underage gamblers usually get shown the door when they're found
gambling in Nevada. The punishment, if any, goes to the casino for not
preventing it.

But now that's changing. Don't assume you'll get a free pass if you're
caught gambling and you're not 21.

Billy Dee Wallace, the underage Las Vegas man who tried to recoup his
$600 loss at The Venetian by telling hotel officials he wasn't old
enough to gamble legally, is now being prosecuted on misdemeanor
charges.

&quot;The district attorney's office approved prosecution,&quot; said Gaming
Control Board member Randall Sayre.

With all the violent crimes in Las Vegas, underage gambling wouldn't
seem to be a priority.

But Wallace pushed the envelope.

On May 6, the 6-foot-4, 220-pounder who supposedly looks closer to 30
than his real age of 20, played craps for more than four hours at five
different tables at The Venetian. (This will be easy to prove since
Wallace is on videotape.)

Instead of taking his losses like a man, after he was down $600, he
went to management and said he was an underage gambler who wanted his
money back. Then he embellished, saying he was a UNLV student and was
doing this for a class project at the UNLV College of Hotel
Administration. That, of course, was a whopper.

The Venetian gave him his money back.

Nine casino employees (dealers and supervisors) received one-day
suspensions for not asking Wallace to prove he was old enough to
gamble. One employee who asked Wallace for ID was commended.

Sayre said the board didn't have any problem with how The Venetian
handled the incident, other than wishing the board had been informed,
calling the hotel's policies &quot;appropriate and fair.&quot;

&quot;What was not appropriate is that a minor took advantage of his age to
get his money back,&quot; Sayre said. &quot;It's a statement to casinos and
minors to use caution, because we take minors gambling seriously.&quot;

Sayre gets about four or five reports a week involving underage
gambling. Few rise to the level of fines, although the law says Nevada
casinos can face a $10,000 fine for allowing underage gamblers to
play.

Since 1998, eight properties have been fined because of underage
gambling. The biggest fine was $350,000 against the Las Vegas Hilton,
where kids waiting in line for the Star Trek attraction were hanging
in the casino.

The Venetian paid $10,000 following an incident with a 19-year-old who
drank and gambled for more than an hour.

Many years ago, when I was the Review-Journal's gaming reporter, my
pre-teen godchildren came to town and during a tour of downtown, the
two boys played the slots right along with their mother. I knew
better, but didn't stop them, figuring security would notice them and
throw us all out. It took far longer than I thought it would to notice
the little guys, but ultimately we got the boot, as we should. My
thinking was that it was harmless, even though I knew it was illegal.

Now, those guys didn't turn out to be compulsive gamblers, although
they did grow up to have a passion for poker, as did my friend and
their mother.

But underage gamblers with gambling addictions are not unknown.

Take the notorious case of Debra Kim Cohen in 1987. Caesars Atlantic
City was fined $100,000 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
for letting her play blackjack and drink. She was a compulsive gambler
... at 17.

Hopefully, Wallace is not a compulsive gambler. I couldn't reach him to ask.

But nine people lost a day's pay because he decided to have some fun,
so it's not like his actions didn't harm others. They did.

It goes back to that old responsibility thing.

He's going to find himself facing a misdemeanor. He's not going to do
hard time by any means, but it will be an inconvenience.

His example may teach other underage gamblers they could face charges
too, which hasn't happened in the past. Maybe that will deter some
minors; maybe it won't.

But nobody should assume that underage gamblers will be punished by
nothing more than a boot from the property. Not always, but sometimes,
there may be consequences.

Based on the article, I would say that if you win at a table, or a
jackpot you have to claim on a slut machine, then they could claim
their money back.  It is sort of the same logic as the kid asking for
the money he lost back.  In the eyes of the law, the underage person
should never have been gambling to begin with, so an identifiable loss
or winnings should be reconciled with the establishment.  After that,
it is up to the law to decide who was at fault and what their
punishment should be.

After further thinking, I don't think that they would ask for their money back.

I think that the casino really doesn't care about underage gambling.
It's just more people to win more money from.  They would probably be
cool with 2 year olds feeding the sluts, but there is the little thing
called the Nevada Gaming Commission.

They are only trying to avoid getting caught and fined by the Gaming
Commission.  So if they catch you playing underage, I am sure they
don't want to draw attention to themselves making a scene kicking
someone out while trying to take their money from them.

They will just quietly escort you out with you money and tell you to
stay the F out, making you leave quit and happy since you got your
money and wasn't busted by the law.

Unless of course you win a jackpot like Nic Papageorgio and have to
fill out a bunch of paperwork - then they aren't gonna fork over any
money to you.

&quot;In South Carolina, children stumble across video poker machines (called the &quot;crack cocaine of gambling&quot;) in convenience stores, pizza parlors, and bowling alleys. With more than 30,000 video poker devices scattered across that state, elementary school children can stop by on their way to and from school to pump money into these machines -- legally! The law in South Carolina does not prevent children from playing, it only prohibits them from collecting any winnings! And who is there, mind you, to enforce that aspect of the law?&quot;

&quot;16-yr old minor wins slot jackpot; mother allowed to keep cash
Tuesday, February 27th, 2007
When a Hong Kong teenager walked into a casino in the Chinese territory of Macau, chaperoned by her mother and grandmother, she can have had little idea of the riches that awaited her - nor of the legal storm that her winnings would generate.

Yes, this 16-year-old unknown girl won a $94,900 jackpot at a Macau casino, and her mother was allowed to keep the cash.

Macau's gaming watchdog forced The Las Vegas Sands to pay the $94,900-winning teenager because of a loophole. Macau's gaming laws ban anyone under 18 from entering a casino, but the laws do not specify a minimum age for gambling once inside.

The young girl, whose name has not been released, was given $12 by her grandmother as a Lunar New Year present to play on some slot machines. The teenager went to the Sands Casino with her mother and grandmother and put the entire amount in a machine. When she hit the jackpot, Sands staff refused to pay her out once they learned she was underage.

However, the territory's gaming authority has ruled that the Las Vegas Sands must pay the teenager from Hong Kong her winnings. &quot;We have decided that the money must be paid, not to the child, but to her mother,&quot; Gambling Authority Director Manuel Joaquim das Neves told the South China Morning Post.

Although she will be paid, the girl's mother has been banned from all Macau's casinos as punishment for bringing a minor into a casino.

That's okay, Mom can always come to Bodog's Online Casino, as long as she leaves the kids at home!&quot;

It just depends, I know they check IDs at the cage, so if you win
anything in chips, you are S.O.L.  If you win a jackpot, you are
S.O.L.  The only grey area seems to be if you win in small increments
on sluts.

&gt; His example may teach other underage gamblers they could face charges
&gt; too, which hasn't happened in the past. Maybe that will deter some
&gt; minors; maybe it won't.

&gt; But nobody should assume that underage gamblers will be punished by
&gt; nothing more than a boot from the property. Not always, but sometimes,
&gt; there may be consequences.

Hanna - they rarely check IDs at the cage...rarely.  I don't remember
if I have ever been carded at the cage.

I would say there is insufficient evidence to rule in favor one way or
the other.  BET IS A DRAW!

I don't know what casinos you go too, but they always check my ID at
the cage.  Maybe its just that you look so much like an old man with
those wrinkly balls of yours.

I've been ID'd maybe two or three times total out of
approximately one billion trips to the cashier.
Strangely enough, it was when I cashed in for a lot of
chips-I remember thinking...&quot;Oh yeah bitch, check that
ID, I just raked at your poor casino, what are you
gonna do about it.&quot;

Yes I was drunk each time.

I guess I just shine of a youthful exuberance when I go to the cages
then.  I feel like they check my ID every time.  However, it may be
the case that I have had too many Saltydogs and their saying, &quot;Good
Evening&quot; sounds more like, &quot;Give me your ID you drunk punk ass minor!&quot;
to my intoxicated ears.

Wait, I don't even know why I am arguing that point.  I guess if a
minor plays at a table without being ID'd then the odds of them being
ID'd at the cage are slim.  Personally I also always get ID'd at the
tables; not surprising considering I always get ID'd at the cage also;
and at the front door; and coming out of the restroom.  Maybe Vegas
just doesn't like me; maybe it fears me...

Yeah, I know how that can happen.  Sometimes when the dealer takes all
my money and says &quot;please give up the seat if you are done playing&quot; what
I hear is &quot;psst...hey drunk guy go get some more money out of the ATM
and I PROMISE you will win it all back, trust me...wink&quot;.  So, yes, I
understand the confusion of casino talk.

I don't get it, did Dan just buy a tv and is looking to sell it, or is
he stealing things and trying to hawk them on the black market.

He hit &quot;Buy&quot; 2X... and bought 2 T.V.'s.  Unlike my special deal - he got 2 T.V.'s for the price of 2 T.V.'s

I think there was a &quot;re-stock&quot; and &quot;shipping&quot; charge associated to it.  I think he'd rather try to sell it for what he bought it for (which honestly was a good deal, as far as I can tell) - then deal with all the &quot;you a sukka&quot; fees associated with returning it.
