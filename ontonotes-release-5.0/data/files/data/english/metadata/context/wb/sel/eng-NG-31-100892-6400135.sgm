There were many others, both close to Ayn Rand or prominent in
Objectivism in the period or later.

NBI lectures in the 1960's used to be divided into smoking and non-
smoking sections. They were about equal, which was comparable to the
national average at the time.

Smoking however has been banned at the Ayn Rand Institute since its
inception. It is now banned at all Objectivist sponsored conferences.

I'd guess that no more than 5% of Objectivists now smoke and I'm told
that annoying anti-smoking "Nazis" are just as much in evidence at
Objectivist events as anywhere else (such as here, apparently). I've
witnessed it myself.

However why should you let facts get in the way of your unsupported
pronouncements and smears - especially when, ironically, you accuse
Ayn Rand herself of supposedly not looking at the facts in regard to
her own smoking? If you are going to uphold facts as the basis for
making judgments, it would be nice if you made even a modest attempt
at consistently applying it yourself.

P.S. Will George or someone explain to me what is this issue with

Excellent post Fred, a breath of fresh air.

The free speech thing is about Brett Cahill, a sad lonely Kantian sod,
who claims that he has discovered all by himself that there can be no
free trade without there being free speech. For a reason best known
only to himself he thinks its a discovery of a life time. He claims
that its not possible to have free trade unless you are talking
freely, yeah I know weird but that is what it is all about, true
story.

When Brett's arguments have been demolished, he usually goes into
hiding for a few days and then comes out babbling on and on about a
new subject as if nothing was ever said. Even more weird, he then
repeats his bizarre claim, *that there can be no free speech without
free trade*.

Hi, Fred.  It's simple.  Bret's a Dean Democrat - the kind who chants
this stuff about Bush et al 24 hours a day - who's expanded to add a
few other targets of his own.  Apparently he's come to believe that
this is how political and philosophical discourse  is conducted.

Frankly, I never thought I'd live to see the day when there were

That precise question has been asked of the dopey git about a thousand
times now and he hasn't offered an answer, although one day he
gloated, that, I wouldn't know how much the bananas cost unless the
shop keeper had exercised his free speech to tell me.

If you do a google you will see that he has even offered a $200 reward

Prima facie it makes no sense. What if there are price controls and
the price is set by some gov't authority? Utility prices are usually
set that way. The utility has to get approval for the prices they
charge, so what "free speech" are they exercising if they have no
choice?

Weird.

Not surprising because it's a straw man.  The record does not show
anyone ever suggested any such thing.

Indeed, enormous political power has been accumulated, not from
pronouncements, but merely by popping outspoken "market economists" on
their fannies with the 9' loaded black snake whip of a simple
question:

"Does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

Seems like our outspoken "market economists" don't have an answer to a
question fundamental to market economics.

There's only several things out outspoken "market economists" can do:

1.  admit they are too dumb to answer a simple question fundamental to
market economics and look utterly ridiculous, or,

2.  deny a self evident truth and look utterly ridiculous, or,

3.  admit free speech is a precondition of free markets and lose their
funding, or

4.  cut 'n run like a GOP presidential candidate running against the
Clintons.

The more the outspoken "market economists" choose # 4 the more they
undermine their credibility and increase my political power.

And help get Hillary into the White House.

You see, there are two types of economic conservatives.  Some are free
to choose to dodge 'n dodge 'n dodge.

Our outspoken market economists, for example.

Other economic conservatives, however, are _not_ free to choose to
dodge 'n dodge 'n dodge.

Like any GOP governor or president.

I can haul any of them in court any time and pop 'em on their fannies
with the 9' loaded black snake of a whip and force them to answer.

Dodgin' ain't an option, unless, of course, they want to resign.

Fundamental?

WTF are you talking about?

Maybe you can tell us what point you are trying to make. What hangs on
it? What great issue or controversy does it answer? As far as I know
the issue has never come up by *any* economist - not at least in the
floating abstraction form you have.

Unless you are making some general observation that "free minds are
necessary for free markets". But somehow I doubt that.

The more likely explanation is that you are deranged.

OK, you asked for it:

I'll pay $200 for a letter from an outspoken market economist from any
of the following:

Hoover Inst.
Heritage Foundation
Cato Inst.
The American Enterprise Inst.
von Mises Inst.
The Chicago School of Economics
The U. S. Chamber of Commerce

The letter must answer the question:

"Does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

To pick up the easy $200, simply Email a copy of the letter in a JPEG,
TIFF or PDF file to BretCah ... @aol.com.

The letter _must_ have,

1.  the letterhead of the organization,

2.  the question "does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

3.  some text for the answer -- it doesn't matter _what_ text, just
some text.

4.  the signature of the outspoken market economist, i. e., "Thomas
Sowell" etc.

I'll send a $200 USPS MO to any USPS address you want.

Err...that's a somewhat different question than the one you previously
posed.

"Does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

For one thing "Does free speech precede..." and "each and every free
trade" is very ambiguous stated in that context and so you have gotten
a number of people pointing out to you that a free trade can occur
without any speech at all.

I already asked you if you are merely stating that political freedom,
including freedom of speech, is necessary for a free market to fully
function and function properly. If that's all your saying, the answer
is clearly yes. But Ayn Rand said as much, so once again I'm not sure
what point you think you are making.

Bot's, er, Bret's, thesis appears to be somewhat the following:

1. Free trade requires free speech.

2. Speech in the US is not free because it is controlled by "corp. media
whores." There is no free speech until all citizens have equal access to all
media, that is, until control of the "public airwaves" is seized from the
"corp. media whores."

3. Ergo, anyone who supports free trade should also support nationalization
of at least the broadcast media.

I believe Bot would also favor nationalization of the print media, since
these depend upon public roadways and mails for distribution.

It is an old and silly argument first trotted out by Marcuse, in my
recollection.

Oh, it's an old socialist canard based on the assumption that freedom
consists in "being able to do whatever you want". So therefore you are
not really free if you are impoverished, freedom consisting in someone
somehow providing you with whatever you want. Of course what happens
to their freedom? Oh, but they "stole" their wealth, etc. etc.

I check my Email every day waiting for someone to claim $200 for a
letter attached in a pdf file where an outspoken "market economist"
managed to think up an answer to the question,

"Does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

But the outspoken market economists at Hoover, Heritage, Cato, Am.
Enterprise, etc., don't seem to want to help any of the unpaid "market
experts" here on newsgroups make an easy $200.

Now why oh why wouldn't an outspoken market economist answer a

But typical of Brat, you are now changing the terms of the question.
All that is required for there to be a free trade is that the buyer
and seller agree on the terms of the sale and the transaction is
consummated without coercion of any kind - for example that the seller
can set the price and the buyer can accept or reject it freely.

So that in contrast a state regulated price, e.g. apt rents under rent
control, are not examples of free trades. The seller is not free to
set his own price in accordance with market conditions. In fact he is
required to sell under the market price. Or, where there is a monopoly
seller, e.g. a single entity legally allowed to sell a particular
product and where competition is prohibited by law, a free trade is
obviously not possible. The buyers have no choice.

The equivocation you are engaged in here is between "a free trade" and
"a free market". You are correct that a free market does not exist if
there is no freedom to advertise. But it is possible to have -
isolated - free trades where there is not a free market. In such a
context, while some free trades are possible, a general free market is
not.

Again, you are confusing "a free trade" with "a free market". Limited
amounts of free trading may be possible even where an overall free
market doesn't exist. In fact that is usually how controlled markets
survive at all, e.g. black markets.

For example, in its final years the Soviet Union avoided widespread
famine by allowing small private plots in agriculture and small scale
markets where people could buy and sell food. But while the Soviet
Union therefore permitted a small amount of free trade, it could
hardly be said that they permitted free speech. And of course that
small amount of free trade did not constitute a true free market.

I know you have difficulty with logic, Bret.

This seems to be your argument:

1. Free speech is a precondition of free markets.

2. Funders do not want free markets.

3. Therefore they will not fund anyone who asserts (1).

That does not follow. If you can't figure out why not for yourself, I'll

with their corp. boss sponsors who would fire them or otherwise cut
the funding.

10. GOP shill tank "market economists" don't want to lose their
income.

11.  When confronted with the free markets w/o free speech question,
GOP shill tank "market economists", therefore, only have three
choices,

a.  Be honest and sincere and agree with a self evident truth and
promote free markets with free speech and lose their income,

b.   Try to refute a self evident truth and look utterly ridiculous,
and, even worse, unwittingly promote the issue and free markets.

Included in this category would be what some here have already tried,
claiming they are too dumb to understand out the question (dumb per
se), adopting the narrow definition of "speech" (dumb per se),
censorship of irrelevant speech (trivial), etc.  The effect is always
the same as refuting a self evident truth, they look utterly
ridiculous and, even worse, unwittingly promote the issue and free
markets.

c.  dodge 'n dodge 'n dodge the issue and die a slow coward's death

12.  Conclusion:  "Market economists" are cowardly shills, not
reputable authorities.

Just let me know when you find an outspoken "market economist" who
won't dodge the question:

"Does free speech precede each and every free trade?"

It should be easy money if you disagree with the "proof" above.

That's not a free trade.

That's theft -- kind of like a tax cheat trying to sponge off the
collective.

Nothing, which is precisely my point. Free speech is not required for
"a free trade". If  a free trade is defined so that all that is
required is that a transaction occurs where buyer and seller freely
enter into it, with no constraint pertaining to the terms of the
transaction, than free speech is not required. In fact, as others have
pointed out, speech itself isn't even required. All that is required
is that the seller is able to set his price as he wishes and that the
buyer willingly accepts it.

If both buyer and seller are shot soon after by the authorities for
something they said, would you say that they had free speech? Or what
if they are shot for the transaction itself which is illegal? Would
you still say that they had free speech?

Does the publisher of an underground newspaper in a dictatorship have
free speech merely because he is able to get it published and in the
hands of some readers? But according to you, so long as the
transaction occurs, he has free speech.

Your ignorance of what you call "market economics" is so profound you
are completely unaware  that the only way that controlled economies
can function at all is through surreptitious black markets, i.e. "free
trades" which occur outside of the controls on the economy. Much has
been written by "market economists" on this very subject.

So, do you want to be put in the position of saying that the fact of
these black markets in dictatorships proves that free speech really
exists in these countries? If in some dictatorship you couldn't open
your mouth without the approval of the authorities, but two men trade
some items in a back alley, is it your view that they have free
speech? In that case then the publication of an underground newspaper,
subject to the death penalty, is also an example of free speech.
