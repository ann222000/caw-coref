Brevity isn't my strong suit but I'm going to try.  The quilt top I'm
assembling is an 'on point' design.  Putting it together is a challenge and
a lot of fun - but -   I just realized that all of the outside block edges
must be trimmed on the diagonal after it is  assembled.
That is going to leave me with hundreds of bias edges.  Oh woe is me.
What Ever can I do to prevent a rippled lettuce?  Is there a neat trick
where I can stitch the diagonals to something Very stable before I cut?  My
mind has toyed with water soluble thread and twill tape, an iron-on water
soluble stabilizer . . . masking tape, duct tape . . . just all kinds of
solutions that are (or seem to be flawed).

Oh Gosh Polly!  What a pain in the neck.   I guess you forgot those outside
setting triangles are squares cut from corner to corner....quarter squares.
That way the outside edge in on grain.  Next time.
Back to the current matter.....what about getting some of the water soluble
stabilizer and sewing that to your outside pieces?  This stuff feels like a
paper stabilizer but dissolves into teeny fibers when soaked in water.  You
could sew on either side of  the cutting line and then cut. I would even try
the water soluble basting spray to anchor the stabilizer before sewing.
Maybe that's overkill.  Now, where to get the stabilizer?
I have bought some from Ricky Tims and Sharon Schamber at quilt shows.  But
I'm sure you can order it online somewhere other than their sites if you
don't want to order it directly from them.    Couldn't find it on Ricky's
site on my first glance, but here is the stuff Sharon sells.
http://www.sharonschamber.com/accessories.htm
I think after cutting my block, I'd trim the stabilzer away up to the
stitched line and save it for other uses...like Sharon's applique method.
Good Luck....I'm sure this is clear as mud.

Oh, Polly, I feel your pain!  There is a way to use larger squares and cut
them diagonally (once or twice as needed to keep the edges from being bias
on the edges and corners) so you don't end up with bias edges, but it's too
late for that now.  I'd suggest adding a border cut on the lengthwise grain.
Measure what your bias edge *should* be- without stretching- for each block
and then measure and mark the border at those same intervals, match the
marks on the top and the border and pin carefully.  Sew the border on with
the bias edge on the bottom against the feeddogs.  That should get you a
stable border edge.  Then continue as usual.  Good luck.....

Not quite sure what you mean Polly?
However, if you mean you are not using setting triangles, but are using
blocks and will just cut them off along their diagonals (almost!), then
I suggest you sew a row of stay-stitching along the actual diagonal (you
will be cutting a quarter of an inch away from the diagonal for the seam
allowance I presume?).  If you placed it just a thread or two into the
seam allowance, you wouldn't even have to unpick it.

Hi Polly - as I read this, you already have bias edges along all the
sides of your quilt top?  Have you checked that there has been no
stretching of the outside edge by comparing the measurements of the
edges against that of the centre lines of the quilt?
Assuming that no stretching has happened, my solution would be to use
an iron with 1.5inch cut strips x the correct diagonal measurement of
the setting squares of freezer paper or iron-on stabilizer - use the
iron to tack down both ends of the strip in place - 'snap' the stable
paper into place by holding the tacked ends - press in place using the
grain direction not the bias (don't press from the v-corner to the
wide edge but pick either the left or right v-seam and go in a
straight line from there)...

If stretching has already happened - then you would have to do a small
gathering stitch to ease in the excess as you work - the diagonal
measurement is important to know in advance so that you can make the
adjustments block by block.  If the diagonal edge is your binding edge
- I would consider using the straight grain of the fabric to make the
binding strips rather than the cross-grain - this would help to
stabilize the quilt edges also - you could mark off the diagonal
measurement of the blocks on your binding strip - pin in place at each
corner of the diagonal - then ease the diagonal to fit the binding
strip and sew it down as you go.

Use your feed dogs to help draw up any stretch on the bias edges by
having the quilt top on the bottom of any stabilizing trick that you
select - working from the wrong side of the quilt top.

Test a couple of suggestions on scraps to decide which idea might work
best for you considering the size of your quilt top and your work
area.  Go have a cup of something before deciding to make any
cuts........jennellh

Thanks and hugs to all of you.  I am using a pattern by Anne Gallo and Susan
Raban in Fons &amp; P Nov '04.  I really thought I had carefully studied it
before I began and that everything appeared to be well-planned.  The outside
corners of the quilt's top are cut right (to my way of thinking).  Only
those 4 pieces have the straight-of-grain where it should be.  When I
re-read the instruction: trim edges straight (with a diagram showing all of
the outside points being cut away) all of my brain's warning beepers started
alarming.
No stretching has happened.  I just want to be Certain that none does.
Again, I thank you kindly, Polly

This is the same solution that occurred to me, Polly. Though I can't

STARCH! Lots and lots of starch, until it is a stiff as a board. I did that
to the fabric before I cut out hundreds of diamonds. Didn't have a single
stretch anywhere. Spray lightly, dry it with your iron, spray again, dry
again, spray again....do NOT move the fabric until it is STIFF.and
completely bone dry.....then go on to the next section. Sewing is a
breeze...loved that 'popping sound' when the needle went in out of that
'board' of fabric. It all came out in the wash. I'd do it again in a
heartbeat as it saved hours of worry and NO STRETCHING biases :)

Yea, it'll take time so don't plan on doing it all in one day. There better
not be a deadline like next week or so..might take a few days just to get it
stiff.but it is so worth it in the end.   Have a bottle of alcohol to wipe
your needle down *IF* you need to (I can't remember if I did or not). No,
dearie, not for drinking--there are better things to drink out there AFTER
you're done for the day. No use having wonky seams by imbibing too soon
after all that slaving over the hot iron. &lt;G&gt;

If I was closer, I'd help cheer you on.

Polly, leave the outside edges until the next thing has been sewn to it.
Just mark the &quot;cutting line&quot; with your ruler and marker of some sort.
Then sew on the border if you are using one. (Sew with the straight cut
border on top.)  If the cut edge is to be the outside edge of the top,
without a border, then quilt with the excess part hanging out there &lt;BG&gt;
Then trim after you have quilted.
You will be sewing on the bias, but not having it cut will keep it from
stretching as much.
If you can, next time plan the setting triangles so that they are cut in
such a way that the outside edge is not on bias. &lt;G&gt; For the sides that
means using Quarter Square Triangles, and for the corners Half Square
Triangles. &lt;G&gt;

Have fun and don't worry about it.

Howdy!

You can do this.
You ain't no &quot;woe&quot;, you're a quilter, sweetheart.

My solutions: I sew a line all the way around the quilt 1/4&quot; away from where
the outside edge will be; this stabilizes it before &amp; after the cutting of
those diagonal lines.  &quot;Sew gently&quot; so as not to stretch anything..
I mean on the quilt.
For some time I've been sewing a fake border on the outer-most edge of my
quilts, something for the hoop to hold onto while I'm quilting; keeps me
from stretching that outer edge, straight or diagonal.  I quilt right up
to that fake border, then remove it and save it for the next quilt.  This
has pretty much stopped the rippled lettuce effect. ;-)

Good luck!

Even doing the stay stitching can result in  wonky edges after the
block has been trimmed.  The only certain way I know of (and I have done
a LOT of sewing with bias edges) is to put strips of tissue paper cut
the appropriate length along the basting/cutting line.  Baste the tissue
right next to the cutting line and then cut the block.  LEAVE the tissue
paper on until the next portion of fabric is sewn to all of those bias
edges.
Now, you can use Solvy that is water or heat soluble (you'd still
need to leave it on until those bias edges have been sewn to something)
but that can get to be *very* expensive if there are a lot of bias
edges.  That's why I recommend tissue paper.  I save up old tissue from
gift boxes and cut it into long strips that are about 2&quot; wide.  I have
found from experience that using strips any narrower are just too
*$&amp;%^$*$)% difficult to deal with.  I'm not sure Polly wants or needs to
go to all that much trouble but it's just an idea I thought I'd toss out
in case one of you had a need in the future :-).  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

I do have wonderful sergers  but I'll have to save solution for when we are
closer buddies.  By the time I got all the differentials, tensions, widths
and lengths perfected, I'd be too old to finish the quilt. There have been
so many good, good, good suggestions here and I'm going to use lots of them.
This quilt is for a returning military wounded and it does need to be
special.  I am very grateful for all the help.  Thank you so much, Polly

The lettuce edge is a dressmaking term.  When you're doing a rolled hem, you
can tug on the fabric as you stitch and it will do a really cute
ruffly-looking edge.  This is okay for bridesmaids' dresses that will (and
should be) thrown away as soon as possible.  Also cute on little girl
clothing.  Not cute on quilt edges.
And as to 'Bullets in her yet' - our local newspaper must be written by
the 5th grade on a rainy day at camp.  DD and I laughed for days at their
headline, Drycleaner Shot in His Parking Lot.  We hoped it didn't hamper his
love life.   Polly

&gt;    What Ever can I do to prevent a rippled lettuce?  Is there a neat trick
&gt;where I can stitch the diagonals to something Very stable before I cut?  My
&gt;mind has toyed with water soluble thread and twill tape, an iron-on water
&gt;soluble stabilizer . . . masking tape, duct tape . . . just all kinds of
&gt;solutions that are (or seem to be flawed).
&gt;    help me, help me         Polly

The starching and the stay stitching , one or the other or both ought
to do the trick. If you want yet more stability, just sew some cheap
rayon seam binding all around, and then either whack it off when you
are done, or stick it inside the binding.  That flimsy bit of ribbon
won't add enough bulk to sing about, but it will  keep naughty edges
from wiggling.

So be very careful NOT to tug!

&gt; The lettuce edge is a dressmaking term.  When you're doing a rolled hem,
&gt; you can tug on the fabric as you stitch and it will do a really cute
&gt; ruffly-looking edge.  This is okay for bridesmaids' dresses that will (and
&gt; should be) thrown away as soon as possible.  Also cute on little girl
&gt; clothing.  Not cute on quilt edges.
&gt;    And as to 'Bullets in her yet' - our local newspaper must be written by
&gt; the 5th grade on a rainy day at camp.  DD and I laughed for days at their
&gt; headline, Drycleaner Shot in His Parking Lot.  We hoped it didn't hamper
&gt; his love life.   Polly

&gt; &quot;Sandy Ellison&quot; &lt;wrote, in part &gt; Good luck!
&gt;&gt;   Iced tea helps, and chocolate... or chocolate w/ mint..or w/ pecans.

&gt;&gt; R/Sandy --wondering if I should be concerned that I understood her use
&gt;&gt;    of the term &quot;rippled lettuce&quot;...
&gt;&gt;    ...and thinking of Justin Wilson's search for &quot;What is a yet?&quot; from
&gt;&gt;   his favorite headline: Woman Shot--Bullet Is In Her Yet
