McMissile' Moment Lands Mom in Jail
Driver Gets Felony Conviction For Tossing Cup of Ice Into Car

To the locals, it's the "McMissile" case.

And like the name, the details of it spill forth like a bad joke: A woman
is driving north on Interstate 95. Three kids squirm in the back seat,
and her sister, six months pregnant and having early contractions, sits
in the front. The stress starts to simmer. Traffic slows, then crawls,
then creeps. More stress. A car cuts in front of her, then scoots away. A
short time later, it darts in again. She can no longer take it. She veers
onto the shoulder and speeds up. Wham! She tosses a large McDonald's cup
filled with ice into the other car.

"From my side, I heard a whoomp," recalled the woman's sister, LaJeanna
Porter, 27. "I was like, 'I know you didn't throw that cup.' She said,
'Yes I did.' "

Neither woman foresaw the seemingly supersize repercussions of that
misguided moment July 2.

No one was injured, but the cup launcher, Jessica Hall, 25, of
Jacksonville, N.C., was charged and convicted by a Stafford County jury
of maliciously throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle, a felony in
Virginia. The instructions given to the jury said that "any physical
object can be considered a missile. A missile can be propelled by any
force, including throwing."

Hall, a mother of three young children whose husband is serving his third
tour in Iraq, has spent more than a month in jail.

The jury sentenced her to two years in prison, the minimum, and a judge
will formally impose a sentence Wednesday. Under state law, the judge can
only decrease the jury's sentence.

I remember this case.  The WP conveniently fails to report the issue from
the victims' (plural) point of view.  The driver and passenger in the other
car were quoted in another story as saying some crazy lady kept passing them
repeatedly (in stop and go traffic, like she'd ever get very far by passing
them), and finally made an ILLEGAL pass to try to get around them, AGAIN.
The driver of the other car was fed up with such shenanigans and refused to
let the car (that Jessica Hall was driving), in front of them.  Next thing
he knows, some UNKNOWN LIQUID is thrown on him by another driver and his
companion is hit with some object, and also covered with some UNKNOWN
LIQUID.  That's fricking SCARY, in this day and age.  I think I'd rather get
hit with a real missile, as it would be over quick, and you wouldn't be left
wondering if your skin was going to melt off your body or something fucked
up like that.

Two years seems appropriate.  I hope she's not released even one second
early.  -Dave

Too bad for her stupidity.  Passing cars in the shoulder to carry out an act
of road rage?  Too bad she stooped to trashy behavior that could have gotten
someone to get killed.  She risked everyone's lives with that stunt.  Good
thing she wasn't drinking hot coffee or smoking a cigarette - she might have
thrown that and got a "lucky" shot.

Because of the kids, the judge will probably let her off with time served.

I think she should serve the max sentence with no time off for good
behavior.  Kids affected?  Well that's mommy's fault.  No sympathy here.

That's a bit paranoid.  Were it to happen to me, I would notice the
McDonald's cup and presume it was in fact, just a soda.

I'm not saying the punishment isn't fair - I think it is, but freaking
out because of how things are "in this day and age" is the same logic
that led a major city to shut down over a few cartoon characters
depicted on lite-brite-like devices recently.

Not to mention, this isn't a "vehicular crime."  It's illegal to throw

nothing about whether the defendant has to be in a car as well.

Which establishes nothing at all about how "most" vehicular crimes are
punished.  It's merely an irrelevant factoid you like to stroke.  It
is of course true that most vehicular crimes are only punished with
fines.  After all, most vehicular crimes are driving errors that cause
harm to nobody.

The reason why the driver in this story didn't get a light punishment
of course is because there was no way she could argue that her action
was a mistake caused by inattention, misunderstanding, or
misjudgement, the causes for most punishable vehicular offenses.

The problem here is the use of abstractions of words

The original concrete object is is a paper cup with ice.

The court then redefines this as "a missile."

Then the idea of "missile" becomes the concrete object, while really
it is only an abstraction.

The problem here is how the law was written and the perversity of how
legal officials think.

Once legal officials think they are dealing with a "missile" it
absolves them from responsibility for the case.

The interest of legal officials is to frighten and control the
populace, especially any member of the populace who does not have a
lot of money to hire a big gun private attorney or someone like a cop
or other official that the court wants to protect.

So the court loves to fasten on false issues like word like "missile"
to justify its perversion. At the same time this gives the court an
excuse to levy more money in fines against defenseless members of the
public.

The case is absolutely nothing more than a misdemeanor, and should
carry no more than 30 days because the cars were not travelling at
high speed in a dangerous situation and the cup and ice were
harmless.

The judge will give a suspended sentence (possibly with community
service).

And this happened over 40 years ago before she was even Laura BUSH.
It's time you got over it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I think the sentence was appropriate but i'm surprised the judge gave
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it. Most vehicular crimes are &quot;punished&quot; with a mere fine no matter
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;how awful.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In New York they have just convicted a man of murder in an car
&gt; &gt; &gt; accident that killed two. He was drunk. The charge and the sentence
&gt; &gt; &gt; were wrong.

&gt; &gt; I've posted several articles here in the last month in which DUIs were
&gt; &gt; convicted of murder. Times may be changing and i'm all for it. Now it's
&gt; &gt; time to charge laura bush with the vehicular manslaughter if not murder she
&gt; &gt; committed in 1963.

&gt; Name the statute that you believe she is guilty of violating.  I'll wait.

I'm still waiting!

Better yet, name the *1963* (going by SFB's comment above referring to
1963) or earlier statute that she is "guilty," of violating. Seems our
resident America hater is trying to apply recent DUI laws retroactively
to our first lady.
