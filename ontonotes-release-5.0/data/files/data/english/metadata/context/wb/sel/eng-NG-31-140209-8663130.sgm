SAN DIEGO | Woman's gripe delays flight to Chicago overnight

August 30, 2007
BY NORMAN PARISH Staff Reporter/npar ... @suntimes.com

A woman who complained that some fellow passengers spoke Arabic and
&quot;had odd behavior&quot; prevented a Chicago-bound American Airlines flight
from departing San Diego, police said Wednesday.

Flight 590, scheduled to depart at 11 p.m. Tuesday, left its gate
about 11:15 but returned to the boarding area after the woman, who was
traveling with at least one child, indicated she wanted to get off the
airplane. The flight then was unable to make Lindbergh Field's 11:30
p.m. curfew for departures, said Irene McCormack, a spokeswoman for
the San Diego Harbor Police.

The flight, carrying 126 passengers, was rescheduled for midmorning
Wednesday and arrived in Chicago in the afternoon, an American
Airlines spokesman said.

McCormack said it is unusual for planes to return to the gate. She
said it's usually for medical and mechanical problems or a
disturbance.

The woman first complained to the flight crew that four to seven men
were possibly speaking Arabic in the boarding area. The woman added
that they &quot;had odd behavior.&quot; The crew decided to return to the
boarding area because the woman indicated she wanted off the plane.

Sounds very much like the crime of Driving While Black.

Did anyone tell her that the airplane uses an Arabic numbering system?

I wonder what she would do if she heard people speaking Spanish.

She'd probably complain of their laziness when they sat down in the plane
instead of mopping the floor and cleaning the toilets.

The obvious question must be why she didn't decline to board in the
first place if she was that concerned. Would have saved everybody
a lot of aggro.

btw- something v/similar happened in Spain a while back on a flight
bound for the UK. A bunch of hysterical passengers caused a furore
on board before take-off when they heard two guys speaking in an
Arabic sounding language, which turned out to be dialect Spanish.
The captain eventually ordered the guys off the plane and they had
to catch another flight next day.

It's basically called the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; and one notable
system was set up to supposedly prevent such things.  It doesn't
seem to be working well these days.
