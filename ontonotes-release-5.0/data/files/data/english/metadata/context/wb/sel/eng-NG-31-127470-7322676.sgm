Zimbabwe and the Politics of Demons and Angels

By Stephen Gowans

http://gowans.wordpress.com/2007/04/15/zimbabwe-and-the-politics-of-d...

Soon after I wrote an article titled "Mugabe gets the Milosevic Treatment,"
posted at Counterpunch.org, I received an e-mail from a representative of SW
Radio Africa, who said I should visit Zimbabwe before writing articles about
the country. This was followed by a Patrick Bond reply to my article in
Counterpunch, invoking the same argument, though in an indirect way. Gowans'
views are nonsense, Bond fumed, at least, as he saw them, sitting across the
Limpopo river, where, he said, he had managed to establish a pretty good
handle on what was going in Zimbabwe.

Had I been writing a travelogue both of my critics would have made a good
point, but inasmuch as I was writing about Washington and London having
dragooned civil society - and in some cases, having created it from the
ground up - for the purpose of ousting the government of Robert Mugabe,
their criticism was wide of the mark. You don't have to travel to Zimbabwe
to figure out that Mugabe is getting the Milosevic treatment.

Even Bond, in his characteristically haughty way, acknowledged the US
intrigues in Zimbabwe with a dismissive "tell us something we don't already
know."

For the record, the British newspaper The Guardian revealed as early as
August 22, 2002 that, "The United States government has said it wants to see
President Robert Mugabe removed from power and that it is working with the
Zimbabwean opposition" "trade unions, pro-democracy groups and human rights
organizations" "to bring about a change of administration."

Washington confirmed its own civil society-assisted regime change plans for
Zimbabwe in an April 5, 2007 report, revealing that in 2006 "The U.S.
government continued to support the efforts of the political opposition, the
media and civil society," including providing training and assistance to the
kind of grassroots "pro-democracy" groups the US had used to bring down the
government of Slobodan Milosevic, and that Bond had celebrated in his
Counterpunch article as "the independent left."

There are three key reasons why the US is trying to oust the Zanu-PF
government:

(1) The Zanu-PF government has expropriated land from white commercial
farmers for redistribution to the rural poor.

(2) It has pursued economically nationalist policies at odds with IMF
demands.

(3) It has been a rallying point for anti-imperialist sentiment in southern
Africa.

SW Radio Africa is a UK-based radio station, funded by the USAID Office of
Transition Initiatives to broadcast anti-government propaganda into
Zimbabwe. Violet Gonda, one of the station's interviewers, has been sending
me transcripts of her interviews ever since my Milosevic Treatment article
appeared on the Counterpunch site. In an April 10 interview with Zimbabwe's
Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi, UK-based Gonda was challenged by Mohadi
to "come to Zimbabwe and witness this for yourself and don't be talking
about things that you don't know," turning the argument Gonda's colleague
had made to me against her.  Mohadi was referring to Gonda's allegations
that MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai had been beaten and that MDC supporters
had been tortured.

Amusing as it was to see the same argument used against SW Radio Africa, the
"come to Zimbabwe before you say anything" demand is based on the
startlingly naïve view that someone else's perspective must align with your
own if only he visits the same piece of real estate. The view of the rural
poor in Zimbabwe, or of veterans of the guerilla war for national
liberation, can hardly be expected to be the same as those of white
commercial farmers, even though they live in the same country. It is
experience, race, which side of colonialism you've been on, and what
opportunities imperialist countries offer you, that account for why the
views of Zimbabwe's rural poor and of Zanu-PF supporters are different from
those of comfortable white professors ensconced in foundation-supported
positions across the Limpopo river, and of young black Africans from Harare
who travel to the US on US State Department sponsored trips to study civil
disobedience techniques.

If my article resonated with anyone, it resonated with black Africans,
members of the African Diaspora and anti-imperialists. White commercial
farmers and anyone linked to the civil society apparatus deployed to unseat
Mugabe's government angrily dismissed it. But why? Why would opponents of
Mugabe - including Bond, who acknowledges that the US is acting to drive
Zanu-PF from power (that is, when he's not arguing the exact opposite) --
take exception to someone drawing attention to something that is a matter of
public record?

The reason, I think, has everything to do what different groups of people
value more: the thwarting of imperialist designs (and the land reform,
redress of colonial injustices, and national sovereignty that are thereby
given space to come to fruition), or ousting Mugabe. If you want Mugabe to
go, you'll oppose anything that reveals efforts to unseat him as being
illegitimate. It won't be enough to say, "Yes, you're right, Washington and
London are engaged in intrigues to topple the Mugabe government, but all the
same I dislike him and his program and here's why." Instead, you'll
fulminate, "This is nonsense!"

You'll probably also practice the politics of demons and angels - the
division of the world into two camps: bad guys and good guys, black hats and
white hats. The objective is to describe leaders, governments, movements and
programs you want to see the end of as demons, and those who are acting to
achieve this end as angels. However, because those that lean to the left of
the political spectrum are unlikely to regard imperialist governments as
angels (although this is far from being invariably true) civil society
groups are recruited as proxies. They appear to be independent, to do good
works, and they have a "socialism from below" feel that resonates with the
Western left. Patrick Bond, who directs a center for civil society, is a
master of invoking the kind of rhetoric about social movements being an
"independent left" operating in spaces between neo-liberal Third World
governments and neo-liberal First World governments that appeals to the
Z-Net congregation.

The politics of demons and angels is terribly unsophisticated. That should
be enough to keep 100 paces away from it. But it should also be eschewed for
an even more compelling reason: because it's used to build support for
imperialist interventions in other countries -- interventions that have
nothing whatever to do with promoting human rights, building democracy, and
keeping the peace, and everything to do with opening up space for the
intervening countries' corporations, banks and investors to make a profit.

Yugoslavia was transformed by Western intervention from a country with a
large socially and publicly owned sector, whose government balked at IMF
reforms, into a neo-liberal workshop of growing economic insecurity and
domination by Western capital. Iraq, brutalized by sanctions, terrorized by
war, and humiliated by occupation, may in time yield its prize of a bonanza
of oil profits to British and US oil firms. These prizes could not have been
won without campaigns of vilification to manufacture consent for
intervention. The bases for these interventions - that Milosevic was
orchestrating a genocide in Kosovo and that Saddam Hussein was hiding banned
weapons - were lies.

In the real world there are three kinds of views on the struggle in
Zimbabwe: those that demonize Mugabe; those that angelize him; and those
that do neither. In the Manichean world of the politics of demons and angels
there are only two: those that demonize Mugabe and those that angelize him.
Anyone who expresses a view that neither demonizes nor angelizes Mugabe is
accused, by those who demonize him, of angelizing him.

A person who notes, quite accurately, and with the weight of evidence behind
him, that Washington, London and the EU have built and enlisted civil
society in Zimbabwe to oust Mugabe, will be called by those who demonize
him, a pro-Mugger, Mugophile, or practitioner of the basest enemy of my
enemy is my friend politics. And yet there is no justification for making
these accusations. Repeating what has been said over and over by the US
State Department and in newspaper reports about US and British intrigues in
Zimbabwe is hardly the same as saying Mugabe is my friend, Mugabe is my
hero, or Mugabe is a great guy, let's organize a celebration in his honor.

When demonizers of Mugabe accuse those who point out that what Washington
and London admit to openly, as being Mugabe-angelizers, we have to ask why?
Is it because their Manichean worldview allows them to see the world in no
other way (if you don't call him a demon you must think he's an angel,
because there are only angels and demons in my world), or is it because
they're so embittered toward Mugabe that they don't care who gets rid of him
or how or what follows him, just so long as he goes, and therefore anyone
who would regard him as something other than a demon must be stopped from
doing so in case he persuades other people?

To be sure, these are not mutually exclusive alternatives. Both may be true.
But what's significant is that both mesh nicely with the openly admitted
plans of Washington and London to oust Mugabe's government. If Mugabe is
universally understood to be a demon, we can hardly marshal the energy to
stop plans to oust him. Why bother? You'll only soil yourself by
association. And who wants to back a demon?

The claim made by Z Magazine's Michael Albert, that human psychology isn't
this simple - that people recognize that a foreign leader's being a demon
doesn't justify an intervention to remove him - reveals Albert to be either
disingenuous or the last person on earth you would want to invite into an
advertising firm as a human relations expert. You don't have to talk to too
many people, including readers of Z Magazine (especially readers of Z
Magazine?) to hear it said: "Oh sure, maybe the bombing of Yugoslavia, the
invasion of Afghanistan, and the war on Iraq, were done for the wrong
reasons, but all the same, they served the useful function of ridding the
world of monsters."

Given a zeitgeist that favors a never-ending series of demons for people to
vent their moral outrage on, it comes as no shock to find professed
anti-imperialists combing their archives to dredge up whatever dirt they can
find on Mugabe. One found an article that exposes Mugabe as a homophobe. But
what have Mugabe's views on homosexuals to do with the struggles in Zimbabwe
that connect the rural poor, white commercial farmers, Zanu-PF, civil
society, and the imperialist machinations of the US and the UK?

The answer, of course, is nothing. But there is a political function and
also a psychological function to be served in good old-fashioned
dirt-slinging. Politically, the object is to personify a movement to
discredit it by drawing attention to the revolting features of the person
the movement has been equated to. There's a Pavlovian character to this. The
pairing of the bell with food, eventually leads to the bell alone calling
forth the dogs' salivation. Likewise, the pairing of the person with the
movement, or class, or nation, eventually leads to the negative features of
the person being transferred to what he has been equated to.  Were one to
dredge up articles on Castro and Che being homophobes, Cuba-supporters would
immediately recognize the political nature of the act.  They don't, however,
seem to recognize the political nature of the act of visibly parading one
individual's failings about, under the guise of a making a significant
contribution to understanding the struggle in Zimbabwe -- or do, but go
about doing it anyway because their commitment to anti-imperialism is
fair-weather (strong when there's no danger of being demonized by
association, absent otherwise.)

The psychological as opposed to political function of dirt-slinging is to
socially affirm oneself as a decent human being by denouncing those who
express indecent values. This is particularly attractive to people on the
far left, who are already mistrusted by the larger community for holding
dangerous and unsettling views. How better to affirm one's place in decent
society than by leading the chorus in denouncing those vilified by
conservative forces as leftist and anti-imperialist "monsters."  See, not
all of us are monsters. We hate the monsters just as much as the rest of you
do.

Let's be clear. The very fact that I'm questioning the practice of
personifying groups of people in order to demonize the individuals equated
to them will be used to denounce me as a thug-hugger, apologist, and
lionizer of monsters. In other words, if you're not with us in vilifying the
latest Satan, you're against us. The great irony is that people who rail
against those who refuse to participate in campaigns of vilifying those
calumniated as left and anti-imperialist "monsters" accuse people like me,
of practicing a with-us-or-against-us politics of the enemy of my enemy is
my friend.

"Unhappy is the land that needs heroes," remarked Brecht. He might have
added, unhappy is the land that needs demons (but then, the land that needs
heroes, must, per force, need demons as their heroes' antithesis.) The movie
The Motorcycle Diaries, about Che Guevera's trip through South America with
his friend Alberto Granado in the early 50s, has been justly criticized for
angelizing the Argentine revolutionary. When those enchanted with Che the
angel discover Che the human being, a man with warts - though, as is true of
all larger-than-life figures, uglier than those of the rest of us - they
become disillusioned, embittered and, if strongly committed to a Manichean
view of the world, swing radically to the other pole, denouncing their
fallen angel as Satan incarnate, rather than recognizing him as a human
being.

The best that can be said about discussions of Zimbabwe, or north Korea, or
Sudan, or Iran that reduce to a set of accusations about the demonic
character of some leader is that they're superficial and frivolous. What can
also be said is that they're products of manipulation by forces seeking to
manufacture consent for interventions in other countries - interventions
that have nothing to do with human rights and democracy and have everything
to do with securing advantages for the intervening countries' corporations,
banks and investors. When we dissociate ourselves from "unsavory" regimes -
and there's not one government, Western or otherwise, free from unsavory
features that would not allow any of them to be demonized - we isolate
really-existing projects for national and class emancipation and thereby
undermine the potential for the success of progressive struggles in the real
world. It's true that in behaving in this way we can avoid demonization by
association and thereby splatter-proof our own vision - a strategy that may
serve the purpose of making our vision more saleable to a skeptical public
-- but it cannot be safeguarded from vilification forever. The moment it too
becomes a threat, it will be vilified as vigorously as all real-world
threats to imperialism are. The idea that you can escape being vilified by
those you oppose is true only so long as you don't oppose them in any kind
of serious or effective way. Utopian visions - and those whose left politics
amount to nothing more than pious expressions of benevolence and goodwill to
men - are no threat.

What's more, the view that the success of the independent (which is to say,
the US government and ruling class foundation supported) left in Zimbabwe in
toppling the Zanu-PF government is something to be wished for, is naïve or
(given the foundation-connections of those who express this view)
disingenuous. A successful civil society-executed regime change operation
will not produce a decentralized, participatory democracy committed to
egalitarianism, but a neo-colonial regime headed by an Anglo-American puppet
which will immediately handcuff land reform and abrogate every policy at
odds with neo-liberalism and ownership of Zimbabwe's assets by US and
British capital.

The models are Poland and Yugoslavia (among others.) There, trade unions and
civil society also managed to enchant the Western left while bringing down
governments that were the only serious obstacle to the installation of
comprador regimes -- regimes whose agenda was one of shutting down
shipyards, selling off socially and publicly owned enterprises, and ushering
in an era of growing inequality and subservience to Western capital. You
don't hear much about these places anymore. You should. They're what
Zimbabwe will become if civil society topples another anti-imperialist
government.
