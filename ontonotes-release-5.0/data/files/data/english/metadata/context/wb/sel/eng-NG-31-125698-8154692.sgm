1. INDONESIAN ANGER OVER &quot;UNFAIR&quot; E.U. AVIATION BAN

Indonesian aviation and tourism authorities have been put on the defensive
by last week's European Union ban on Indonesian airlines
[ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6248490.stm ], but are beginning to
question the timing, methodology and motivation of the move. Although the
initial reaction has been again to plead their case before the EU Transport
Commission and cite all the various measures taken recently to boost safety
of the Indonesian airlines, some senior officials are taking a more
questioning attitude.

In an interview with the Jakarta Post, Indonesian Transportation Society
(MTI) chairman Bambang Susantono expressed skepticism about how the
commission's experts arrived at their conclusions, &quot;I don't remember them
coming here to inspect the airlines directly.&quot; He said that information for
the report may have come from pilots flying in and out of Jakarta.

Garuda Indonesia's Vice President for Operations, Ari Sapari, told
Indonesian TV that the ban &quot;has followed an uncommon procedure&quot; as the
&quot;EU has never audited Indonesian airlines.&quot; By contrast, American aviation
authorities have &quot;done their own audit before making their assessments, and
American authorities have not banned Indonesian airlines,&quot; he said.

Another report quoted Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI) executive
director Sudaryatno as saying: &quot;We must also look at this from the
perspective of the saturated markets that exist in the developed world. We
must be careful as this ban could be part of a strategic plan to ruin the
reputation of local airlines so that foreign airlines can get a foothold in
this country.&quot;

He added, &quot;Soekarno Hatta Airport (Jakarta) and Ngurah Rai Airport (Bali)
are no longer gateways to Indonesia. They have been replaced by Singapore's
Changi. The situation could worsen if the stakeholders in the industry do
not take the necessary steps.&quot;

Indonesia was apparently too late to include the latest assessments audit
that noted significant improvements made by Indonesian operators during
the past three months, to be included in the EU Commission report, despite
efforts having been made to do so, explained Director General for Air
Transportation, Budhi Suyitno to the press.

Although the ban is technically only applicable to Indonesian airlines
flying to Europe, it sends out a number of much wider messages, especially
to travel agencies booking EU citizens on flights to and within Indonesia.
Insurance companies, too, will not cover EU citizens travelling on
Indonesian flights, or be legally within their rights to refuse to make
payouts in the event of a mishap.

Interestingly, the ban came just before a four-day Strategic Seminar on
Aviation Safety that started in Bali today. The seminar will include a
one-day session on &quot;International Agencies Assistance Framework&quot; at which
donors and aid agencies from the developed countries will outline how they
can fund safety-upgrade programmes for Indonesian aviation. Effectively,
this will make Indonesia more dependent on financial and technical handouts
from abroad.

The ban comes exactly three months before Bali hosts the annual travel mart
of the Pacific Asia Travel Association between September 28-30, 2007 to
which nearly all the buyers and sellers will be flying on Indonesian
airlines, especially Garuda, the host airline. Although PATA has recently
been trying to position itself as a champion of aviation liberalisation in
the Asia-Pacific, there was no immediate comment on the ban on the PATA
website and no statement was issued. Instead, the organisation's first
public statement of this week was to herald a strategic partnership with a
global research company to monitor the Chinese outbound market.

It was left up to Indonesia Digest Editor Tuti Sunario, a former senior
official of the Indonesian Tourism Ministry, to defend the industry's
interests. She wrote in her weekly newsletter: &quot;Most concerned with these
latest developments is the Tourist Industry which sees the EU ban as another
threat to international confidence in Indonesia's tourism,&quot; especially as
the market has just &quot;sufficiently recovered from the fear of terrorism.&quot;

&quot;Europe and European tourists form a very important market for Indonesia,&quot;
Mrs Sunario wrote. European tourists stay between 15-18 days in Indonesia,
visiting many regions and spending an average of US$1,450 per person per
stay, as against Asian visitors from Singapore, Malaysia, China or Japan,
who stay an average of 5-8 days and spend an average of US$ 500
(Singaporeans) to US$ 838 (Japanese) per stay.

&quot;It is envisaged that with stagnation in the number of European tourists,
regions that will suffer most are the poor, outlying traditional villages
that have so far benefited from tourism, such as those in Toraja, Nias, Lake
Toba, the Moluccas, Papua, East and West Nusatenggara, and the Dayak
villages in Kalimantan, but also remote and handicraft villages in Central
and East Java. She added, &quot;The European ban, although perhaps well meant,
will in the end thwart those very efforts that Europe - and Indonesia - both
wish to foster, which are the preservation of Culture, Sustainable
Environment and the Alleviation of Poverty through the development of
Tourism.&quot;

Meanwhile, a chart posted on the Indonesian aviation department website
[ http://www.dephub.go.id/udara/dsku/Data/Audit%20Plan%202006.pdf ]
indicates that audits were carried out on several Indonesian commercial
air-carriers all through 2006. In most of the cases, the department reported
that it was following up on the findings.

2. MINISTER SAYS INDONESIA &quot;VERY DISAPPOINTED&quot;

July 02, 2007 Source: Xinhua -- The Indonesian government is disappointed
with a decision by the European Commission to ban all Indonesian airlines
from flying to the European Union and has asked a chance to make a defense,
an official said Monday. Transportation Minister Jusman Syafii Djamal said
the decision was unilaterally taken without prior dialogues with the
government.

&quot;We consider the EU has acted unfairly and therefore we are very
disappointed,&quot; he was quoted by leading news website Detikcom as saying.
The minister made his remarks during a meeting with the International Civil
Aviation Organziation (ICAO) on Bali island. &quot;We do not expect that the
process to improve aviation safety in Indonesia will involve the isolation
of (our) airlines,&quot; he said at the meeting attended also by ICAO president
Roberto Kobeh Gonzales.

Jusman said the government on June 22 asked the EU to give an opportunity to
the government to brief EU officials about the actions Indonesia has taken
to improve air transportation safety before the EU announced the ban.
The EU reportedly agreed to meet Indonesian transport officials but only in
October as the soonest.
&quot;That's another reason why Indonesia is very disappointed,&quot;  said Jusman.

from flying in its airspace, though certain circles said that it would not
affect domestic flights. In less than a week after Thursday's reports that

Dear All,
Bangsa ini memang nggak pernah dewasa!
Larangan muncul karena maskapai kita amburadul semua, tidak mempedulikan
keselamatan penumpangnya, lha kok bukan dijadikan cambuk untuk perbaikan,
malah emosional menanggapinya!

Ini dampak neoliberalisme yang kebablasan.
Swasta diserahkan mengelola airline. Namun pemerintah
lemah dalam membuat dan menegakkan aturan.

Akibatnya swasta berlomba2 agar untung. Pesawat umur
10 tahun ke atas bahkan lebih 20 tahun tetap
diterbangkan agar untung.

Selama belum jatuh, terbangkan terus pesawat agar
tetap dapat uang dari penumpang.

Saya sendiri waktu dari Padang dan tiba di Bandara
Sukarno Hatta, ternyata kaca pesawat di bagian dalam
di kursi penumpang di depan saya copot. Untung sudah
landing...:)

&gt; Director General for Air
&gt; Transportation, Budhi Suyitno to the press.

&gt; Although the ban is technically only applicable to
&gt; Indonesian airlines
&gt; flying to Europe, it sends out a number of much
&gt; wider messages, especially
&gt; to travel agencies booking EU citizens on flights to
&gt; and within Indonesia.
&gt; Insurance companies, too, will not cover EU citizens
&gt; travelling on
&gt; Indonesian flights, or be legally within their
&gt; rights to refuse to make
&gt; payouts in the event of a mishap.

&gt; Interestingly, the ban came just before a four-day
&gt; Strategic Seminar on
&gt; Aviation Safety that started in Bali today. The
&gt; seminar will include a
&gt; one-day session on &quot;International Agencies
&gt; Assistance Framework&quot; at which
&gt; donors and aid agencies from the developed countries
&gt; will outline how they
&gt; can fund safety-upgrade programmes for Indonesian
&gt; aviation. Effectively,
&gt; this will make Indonesia more dependent on financial
&gt; and technical handouts
&gt; from abroad.

&gt; The ban comes exactly three months before Bali hosts
&gt; the annual travel mart
&gt; of the Pacific Asia Travel Association between
&gt; September 28-30, 2007 to
&gt; which nearly all the buyers and sellers will be
&gt; flying on Indonesian
&gt; airlines, especially Garuda, the host airline.
&gt; Although PATA has recently
&gt; been trying to position itself as a champion of
&gt; aviation liberalisation in
&gt; the Asia-Pacific, there was no immediate comment on
&gt; the ban on the PATA
&gt; website and no statement was issued. Instead, the
&gt; organisation's first
&gt; public statement of this week was to herald a
&gt; strategic partnership with a
&gt; global research company to monitor the Chinese
&gt; outbound market.

&gt; It was left up to Indonesia Digest Editor Tuti
&gt; Sunario, a former senior
&gt; official of the Indonesian Tourism Ministry, to
&gt; defend the industry's
&gt; interests. She wrote in her weekly newsletter: &quot;Most
&gt; concerned with these
&gt; latest developments is the Tourist Industry which
&gt; sees the EU ban as another
&gt; threat to international confidence in Indonesia's
&gt; tourism,&quot; especially as
&gt; the market has just &quot;sufficiently recovered from the
&gt; fear of terrorism.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Europe and European tourists form a very important
&gt; market for Indonesia,&quot;
&gt; Mrs Sunario wrote. European tourists stay between
&gt; 15-18 days in Indonesia,
&gt; visiting many regions and spending an average of
&gt; US$1,450 per person per
&gt; stay, as against Asian visitors from Singapore,
&gt; Malaysia, China or Japan,
&gt; who stay an average of 5-8 days and spend an average
&gt; of US$ 500
&gt; (Singaporeans) to US$ 838 (Japanese) per stay.

&gt; &quot;It is envisaged that with stagnation in the number
&gt; of European tourists,
&gt; regions that will suffer most are the poor, outlying
&gt; traditional villages
&gt; that have so far benefited from tourism, such as
&gt; those in Toraja, Nias, Lake
&gt; Toba, the Moluccas, Papua, East and West
&gt; Nusatenggara, and the Dayak
&gt; villages in Kalimantan, but also remote and
&gt; handicraft villages in Central
&gt; and East Java. She added, &quot;The European ban,
&gt; although perhaps well meant,
&gt; will in the end thwart those very efforts that
&gt; Europe - and Indonesia - both
&gt; wish to foster, which are the preservation of
&gt; Culture, Sustainable
&gt; Environment and the Alleviation of Poverty through
&gt; the development of
&gt; Tourism.&quot;

&gt; July 02, 2007 Source: Xinhua -- The Indonesian
&gt; government is disappointed
&gt; with a decision by the European Commission to ban
&gt; all Indonesian airlines
&gt; from flying to the European Union and has asked a
&gt; chance to make a defense,
&gt; an official said Monday. Transportation Minister
&gt; Jusman Syafii Djamal said
&gt; the decision was unilaterally taken without prior
&gt; dialogues with the
&gt; government.

&gt; &quot;We consider the EU has acted unfairly and therefore
&gt; we are very
