INTRODUCTION
This paper will explore a modern-day Tantric organization, Ananda
Marga (The Path of Bliss), attempting to trace its Tantric roots, describe
its Tantric approach, and make note of its Tantric innovations.

The figure of the guru is especially important in the world of
Tantra, and in this, Ananda Marga (AM) is no exception. Under the guidance
of AM's guru and founder, Shri Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, AM developed a unique
blending of Yogic, Shaeva, Vaesnava and social liberation characteristics,
bringing to bear the Tantric worldview on social problems in a coordinated
manner. It is this last which seems to me unprecedented.

Tantra is a complicated phenomenon. It is difficult to say
definitively what Tantra is or is not. Certain themes or commonalities link
otherwise disparate groups, but for the most part Tantrics focus on personal
spiritual liberation. AM is unusual, I believe, because it attempts to link
Tantric practice, a traditionally individual concern, with efforts at social
change.

I have been a member of this organization for 17 years. This cannot
help but color my perspective. My aim, however, is not to lead cheers for
the group but to strive to provide a critical understanding of its context
and history.

There are precedents for the political use of Tantra, of course.
Historically, Tantra has been used to shore up the reign of kings, and even
present-day political leaders such as Indira Gandhi are known to have
consulted Tantrics. (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1979: 30.) But this is not
Tantra as social emancipatory tool. AM claims to signal an inclusive shift
from individual to collective liberation.

I will look first in general terms at historical Tantra. Then, since
the organization in question originated in West Bengal under a Bengali
preceptor, I'll look briefly at the practice of Tantra in Bengal. I will
then turn to the philosophy and practices of AM itself, and finally explore
Sarkar's concept of Tantra as a tool for social liberation.

THE EMANCIPATING UNIVERSE

According to Teun Goudriaan, Tantra is rooted in very old traditions
of unsystematized yoga and body cult, shamanism, medicine, magic white and
black, astrology, religious eroticism and folkloristic ritual. (Gupta, Hoens
and Goudriaan, 1979:17).

Although not all Tantric traditions share the same qualities, one
can generalize about certain defining characteristics. Tantra often is
concerned with kundalini and yoga, the mystic nature of speech, mudras,
yantras, mantras which are invested with power, a practical sadhana,
categories taken from non-Tantric sources, visualization, and ritual
practices. It often utilizes transgressive elements which rock the boat of
status quo values. (Goudriaan and Gupta, 1982).

Goudriaan notes that Tantra is seen by some as a reaction to the
Vedas which were considered to be no longer comprehensible for mankind in
the present deteriorating stage of world history. It is also said that Vedic
worship was lacking in results. (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1982: 15).

Though Tantra may be traced much further back, a boom in Tantric
practice occurred around the middle of the first millenium A. D. Sources
prove the existence of regular Shaivite cults already in the earliest
centuries A.D. (Goudriaan and Gupta,1982: 21).

David White, in his useful book The Alchemical Body, casts an
illuminating glow on the cosmology of Tantrics. The Tantric universe is
divine and life-affirming. It is a pulsating, vibratory place, in which
"matter, souls, and sound are the stuff of the outpouring of godhead into
manifestation, with godhead generally identified with Siva and his
self-manifestation or self-reflection taking the form of the Goddess." It is
a bipolar, sexualized universe, "in which all change and transformation are
viewed as so many instances of an interpenetration of male and female
principles." And, ultimately, it is an emancipating universe. (White, 1996:
143).

Douglas Brooks' definition is especially helpful. According to
Brooks, Tantra needs to be understood metaphorically. Literally in Sanskrit
a "loom" or warp of threads, "Tantras weave together concepts and
prescriptions for action to create distinctive, synthetic types of spiritual
discipline. The Tantras expand the possibilities for human liberation and
empowerment in the increasingly degenerate Kali age." (Brooks, 1990: 5).

Tantra thus seems often to be a synthetic phenomenon, absorbing
ideas and practices left and right, so to speak, in order to suit the needs
of time and place.

In line with this synthetic character, the general philosophies
underpinning Tantra, according to Goudriaan, have been diverse. They may be
categorized as monism, monism cum dualism or dualism. There is the
transcendental unity of Siva and Sakti usually held by Sakta and Saiva
philosophy. The Vedantic doctrine of the identity of the Self and Absolute
is repeated in Tantric sources. And, there is also considerable emphasis
laid on bhakti in many Tantric sources; the foremost recipient being the
guru. (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1982: 49).

"POETS AND REVOLUTIONARIES"

I'll turn now to an examination of Tantra in Bengal. Bengal has been
a powerful matrix for the development of Tantric thought. In this region
mingled Buddhist, Vaesnava, Shaeva and Shakta traditions. S. C. Banerji
notes some of the major points and players.

Krsnananda, called the brightest luminary in the firmament of the
Tantra literature of Bengal, lived around 1500 A. D. His Tantrasara contains
the essence of Tantra works of all the sects, and is very popular in Bengal.
He is credited with the conception, for the first time, of the Kali image
current in Bengal.

Purnananda, another great figure from the late1500s A. D., wrote in
his Sritattva-cintamani about the means of acquiring siddhis, or occult
powers, destroying enemies, understanding animals, and other matters.

Renewed interest to Tantrism by Bengal aristocrats in the latter
part of the 18th century resulted in the writing of the Mahanirvana Tantra.
(Gupta, Hoens, and Goudriaan, 1982: 28). Banerji agrees that this work is
not very old.

This text may have been written by Hariharanandanatha, preceptor of
the great social reformer, Ram Mohan Roy, to shore up his reformist views.
The first edition was published by Adi Brahma Samaj, an organization founded
by Roy. (Banerji, 1978: 104). In it, great importance is placed on mantra,
bija, yantra, mudra, and nyasa. It also touches on the pancamakara, the five
forbidden substances. Â Banerji notes controversy over whether the rites of
this recent text are valid.

All Bengali works are unanimous in according the most exalted place
to the guru, a position higher than that even of one's father. The guru is
considered as Siva or Para Brahman incarnate. Initiation by a woman is also
said to be salutary. (Banerji, 1978: 123).

Other typical Tantric rites described in Bengali Tantric works
include Saiva sadhana - worship on a corpse, smashan sadhana, and the
worship of yoginis. Great importance is given to antaryaga, that is, as
Banerji describes it, mental worship in which the five forbidden substances
are conceived as abstract things.

Bengali Tantra accords an exalted place to women, according to
Banerji. Sudras, too, are equally eligible to participate.

In Bengal, Saktism is still the prominent denomination. (Gupta,
Hoens, and Goudriaan, 1982: 27). This is goddess worship, such as that of
Daksinakalika. The goddess is seen as not only the manifestation of
creation, but as the ultimate reality as well.

"Devi who is the real cause of the cosmic process also manifests
herself in the fivefold shape of the elements although her highest form is
identical with Brahman." (Goudriaan and Gupta, 1982: 77).

Tantra in Bengal could not escape the overwhelming influence of
Vaisnavaism as preached by Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the 15th century A. D.
Caitanyaism flooded the religious life of Bengal, writes Banerji, and the
doctrine which holds Caitanya to be the Supreme Being was an accepted creed.
(Banerji, 1978: 116).

Goudriaan notes that Vaisnavas in medival Bengal developed a special
kind of Tantric sadhana called Sahajiiya "with as its most important
characteristic the theory and sometimes ritual practice, of divine love
exemplified in its most pure form in the feelings towards another's wife."
(Gupta, Hoens, and Goudriaan, 1982: 27).

Great Goddess worshippers such as Sri Ramakrishna, and his disciple,
Vivekananda, characterized as a Hindu missionary to the West, also left
their mark on Bengal Tantra. (de Bary, 1958: 85).

Finally, it is important to note that Bengal is marked by a certain
revolutionary spirit. On an anecdotal level, a Hindi-speaking friend in
Calcutta once described Bengalis to me as "all crazy - either poets or
revolutionaries." In the last two hundred years, Bengal has been fertile
ground for social activists and revolutionaries, including those who combine
religion with their activism. The partition of Bengal by the British sparked
a great deal of such political activity.

In this regard, I would like to mention Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950).
According to de Bary, "Aurobindo defined the essence of religious
nationalism in a manner which for sheer passion has never been surpassed...
He came to idealize both his native land and his ancestral faith and to
identify one with the other in a way no previous thinker had dared to do."
However, he also failed to perceive the limitations of Hindu nationalism in
light of India's multi-cultural reality, foreshadowing a modern dilemma. (de
Bary, 1958: 173).

It is also interesting to note the work of 19th century Bengali
novelist Bankim Chatterjee, who wrote Anandamath, a novel about
revolutionary sannyasins who lead a revolt against Muslim dominance (in a
thinly veiled description of the situation under the British). In the novel,
Chatterjee popularized the rallying cry Bande Mataram., "Hail Mother India,"
identifying India with Sakti Herself.

From a fictional order of radical monks we jump to an actual one.
There are similarities between Anandamath and Ananda Marga. Both are
comprised of dynamic renunciates dedicated to social change. However, an
important shift must be noted, that from Hindu nationalism to a "universal
humanism." For Sarkar, it is not India, but the universe, as mother, Cosmic
Consciousness as father, and all humanity as brothers and sisters.

"TANTRA IS SADHANA"

With this shift, the theme of this paper comes into sharper focus.
The goal for practitioners of Ananda Marga is clearly spelled out by Shri
Sarkar: Atmamoksartham jagat hitayaca, that is, liberation of self and
service to the universe. The liberatory emphasis, combined with an expansive
embrace of others, Â is emphasised from the outset.

Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (1921-1990) was a teacher, philosopher,
spiritual preceptor, revolutionary, and administrative genius. Based in
Calcutta, he created a large, dynamic, world-wide organization, composed of
both monks and nuns, and family people committed to the above-mentioned
ideal. In his spiritual capacity he was known as Shrii Shrii Anandamurti.
However, I will refer to him in this paper using his family name, under
which he wrote many of his social treatises.

At the center of Sarkar's vision lies Tantra.

His fundamental view is of a universe embodying a deep shared
consciousness which situates all human activity in reverential relationship.
The resources of this universe are seen as common patrimony. This
perspective leads to a call for not only spiritual emancipation, but social
and economic liberation as well. Through Tantric practices, one may acquire
the clarity, determination and vigor to work for social justice. The
following quote lays out the dimensions of this idea:

"Those who think dharma to be an individual's concern conceive it in
a very narrow sense. Dharma leads to Cosmic unity, inculcating in the
individual mind Cosmic idealism. {It is} the unifying force in humanity.
Moreover, spirituality provides a human being and humanity at large with
that subtle and tremendous power with which no other power can be compared.
Therefore, with spirituality as the base, a rational philosophy should be
evolved to deal with the physical, psychological and socio-philosophical
problems of the day." (Anandamurti, 1994: 77).

Sarkar sees spirituality as a practical process. The meditative
practices which comprise the effort to expand one's consciousness are
essentially Tantra.

"The process of transforming [latent divinity] into the Supreme
Divinity is known as Tantra sadhana. The sleeping divinity in animality is
termed, in the language of spiritual aspirants, the kulakundalinii. So we
find that actually the spirit of Tantra lies in infusing a [vibration] in
the kulakundalinii and pushing her up towards the spiritual goal."
(Anandamurti, 1994: 22).

And, "the significance of the term tantra is 'liberation from
bondage [the bondage of dullness or staticity].' ... The spiritual practice
which liberates the aspirant from the dullness or animality of the static
force and expands the aspirant's self is Tantra sadhana. So there cannot be
any spiritual practice without Tantra. Tantra is sadhana." (Anandamurti,
1994: 22).

He goes on to say that Tantra in itself is neither a religion nor an
ism. Rather it is a fundamental spiritual science.

As noted earlier, the practices of Tantra are often viewed as
transgressive, forcing one to break out of sterotypical ways of viewing
oneself and the world. They span the imaginative gamut, including sexual
sadhana, sadhana involving skulls, etc. Sarkar locates AM in the middle of
this continuum. That is, AM is madhyama or the middle way.

"The spirit of sadhana is to wage an all-round fight against Maya,
to overcome her tenacious influence. This battle of sadhana can be carried
out in one of three ways - Daksinacara sadhana, Vamacara, sadhana or
Madhyamacara sadhana. Daksinacara sadhakas are afraid to declare war
directly against Prakrti. They want to please Maya through entreaties, and
they pray for liberation from that propitiated Maya.

"Vamacara sahdakas are inclined to continue the random and
relentless fight against Maya, irrespective of whether the goal is fixed
before them or not. Their will to struggle, their courage and valiant spirit
are undoubtedly praiseworthy.. But in the absence of a fixed goal before
them, they fail in their endeavour to attain liberation. Often, they become
tempted to mususe their hard-earned spiritual power, causing damage to
themselves and society.

"Madhyamacara sadhakas want to fight against Prakrti, keeping Brahma
fixed before them. They move forward towards the spiritual effulgence of
Brahmajyoti, tearing the veil of darkness of Avidya." (Anandamurti, 1994:
88-90).

This is, of course, right and left-handed, and middle Tantra,
according to Sarkar. On one side, the practitioner engages mainly in
(Vedic-based) prayer, and on the other in transgressive practices. The
middle way in which one's mind is fixed firmly on the goal leads most
directly to the realization of God. It is interesting to note the mention of
the effect on society of Tantric power.

Goudriaan notes that for some adherents of Tantrism who strove after
a compromise betweenVeda and Tantra, "the practice of Vedic as well as
Tantric ritual, is a necessary condition to spiritual emancipation." On the
other hand, the Tantric dharma is described as the essence, the best part of
the Veda. (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1982:15).

AM for the most part focusses solely on the practice of Tantra.
However, some Vedic mantras are recognized, such as the Samgaddchadvam
shloka. Sarkar says that "moving together means that all portions of
society, all portions of the collective body, should have the spirit to move
ahead. Samgacchadhvam means to build a strong, well-knit society where there
shall be no exploitation, no superiority complex or inferiority complex."
(Anandamurti, 1981: 50).

It should be clear that AM fits into the Tantric ballpark. But in
terms of the variety of underpinning philosophies that may accompany Tantric
practice, where do its roots lie?

David White notes some of the main possibilities: Samkhya "affirmed
the existence of a plurality of selves and the reality of the world for so
long as spirit remained confused with nature or original materiality."
Vedanta Â "asserted the identity of the individual soul with the universal
soul while denying the reality of the phenomenal world." Yoga Â "was a
remounting of those stages through which absolute poured itself out to form
our manifold, manifest universe." (White, 1996: 33). And, as noted
previously, one of the main fissure lines is on the question of monism and
dualism.

The philosophy of Ananda Marga is described by Sarkar as
Advaeta-Dvaeta-Advaeta, that is, nondualistic-dualistic-nondualism.

"The jiivas indeed proceed from dvaeta to advaeta, but that
dualistic nature of the jiivas and their emergence on this earth, is due to
the fact they have come out of Parama Purusa in the centrifugal movement of
His creation. We come therefore to the final conclusion that the jiivas are
initially non-dualistic in nature. It is only in the middle stage that they
are dualistic in nature. Later... they return to their non-dualistic
character. (Anandamurti, 1981: 191).

In his Ananda Sutram, Sarkar elaborates on this further. Brahma is
the ultimate truth, and the world is truth as well, but a relative truth.
This rejects the idea of world as illusion. The world, though relative, is
real, and in true Tantric fashion, offers itself to be used as a vehicle for
realization.

At the core of this philosophy is the linking of Shiva and Shakti.
Brahma is the composite of these two. Shiva is consciousness, Shakti or
Prakrti, energy, made up of the three gunas, the sentient, mutative and
static forces. Bursting forth from unqualified consciousness, the universe
is expressed through Cosmic Mind, then through the five fundamental factors.
There is a cycle of creation here, consciousness moving from subtle to
crude, then back from crude matter to the ultimate subtlety of reunion with
the Absolute.

The goal of the individual soul is anandam or brahma, infinite
bliss. (Anandamitra, 1981).

The process of returning to that infinite state is sadhana. And the
method is yoga. Ananda Marga's spiritual practices are based, in part, on
Patanjali's astaunga yoga.

The classic characterization of yoga can be found at the beginning
of Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, where yoga is defined as the suspension of the
cognitive functions of the mind - yogas cittavrttinirodhah.. (Verma, 1996:
163).

Yet Sarkar notes that since it is the nature of mind to think, to
try to stop the thinking process is unnatural. He supports the Tantric
definition: Sam'yogo yogo ityukto jiiva'tma' Parama'tmanah. According to
Tantra, unification of jiivatma with Paramatma means yoga (Anandamurti,
1981: 7).

The Yoga Sutra assigns to yoga eight steps: yama, niyama, asana,
pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. According to Gupta, in
strict Tantra circles yoga had only six steps, omitting the first three of
Patanjali's eight steps. (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1979: 165).

Sarkar recognizes the eightfold path. In his book, A Guide to Human
Conduct, he places great emphasis on ethics, as spelled out in Yama and
Niyama. The spiritual path begins here; one cannot develop without morality.

Key to Tantric yogic practice is the ista mantra, taught by the
guru, or by an acarya, one of his representatives.

Hoens notes that "by meditation on the place of the highest
principle he is saved, thus it is called man-tra." Mantra is comprised of
the root man - "applying emotional, moved, willful, intentionally directed
thought" and the suffix -tra Â which is used for names of instruments.
(Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan, 1979: 102).

Sarkar has a similar definition: man-tra means that which liberates
the mind. (Anandamurti, 1993: 69). Cosmic ideation is at the core of this
transformative process. Simple repetition of mantra without ideation on its
meaning (generally, the unity of atma and Brahma), is fruitless.

"Every action should be guided by dharma, with the sole desire to
become one with Paramapurusa. The practical process for this is Guru Mantra
or Madhuvidya, the second lesson of Ananda Marga sadhana - taking the
ideation of the Supreme with every action, so that all energies are
channeled toward the Goal. " (Anandamurti cited in Anandamitra, 1981: 92).

Cakras, mind, kundalinii and vrittis, or "ways of expression of
mind," are all components in this sadhana. Sarkar reconceptualized the
process of purifying cakras and raising the kundalinii, terming the process
"biopsychology," placing emphasis on the effects of the interrelationship
between mind, the glands, cakras and behavior. Hence, a great emphasis is
placed on purity of diet and conduct.

THE SHAEVA-VAESNAVA SYNTHESIS

One factor which distinguishes AM significantly from much of Bengal
Tantrism is the absence of any form of goddess worship. In fact, the worship
of deities is not recognized per se. (Anandamurti, 1993: 184). Rather, there
is a focus on Supreme Consciousness as the goal, a consciousness which
underlies and composes creation.

Ananda Marga sadhana, according to Sarkar, follows three stages,
that of Shakta, Vaesnava, Saeva. The Sakta approach seems to be a
reinterpretation by Sarkar, having little to do with the goddess.

"A sakta is one who is determined to awaken his or her cognitive
faculty and fight against the negative influence of the static principle...
In the second stage, the sadhaka remains absorbed in the flow of Cosmic
bliss; this is Vaesnava sadhana, the endeavour to throw oneself into the
current of Cosmic bliss and float towards the supreme goal....The attainment
of the eternal stance at the altar of Nirguna Brahma is Sharvavastha [the
highest Shaivite stage of realization]. In Ananda Marga there has been a
unique blending of the Shakta, Shaeva and Vaesnava systems of spiritual
practice." (Anandamurti, 1994: 7).

The essence of Shaeva Dharma is all-round expansion, Sarkar notes in
Discourses on Tantra (Anandamurti, 1993: 189). This is another sort of
reinterpretation. We may call AM a Shaeva path, but not in the traditional
sense of worshipping the personal Hindu god Shiva. Rather, Shiva stands for
that Supreme Consciousness that is the goal of the spiritual aspirant.

As noted, Sarkar does recognize the fundamental intertwining of
Shiva and Shakti, in the sense of knowledge and energy working in harmony.
But, "this energy, unless guided and controlled by consciousness, may
indulge in destructive activities." (Anandamurti, 1993: 237). In Ananda
Sutram he writes that the goal of the spiritual aspirant is not Prakrti, but
Purusa. "Their ultimate goal is the blissful Cosmic Consciousness, which is
above the influence of Prakrti, imperishable, irreducible." (Anandamurti in
Anandamitra, 1981: 9).

Anandamitra adds, "In India there are many worshippers of Prakrti
who ideate on Shakti. They may develop occult powers, but their ultimate
union is with Prakrti." (Anandamitra, 1981: 9). This interpretation might
stir a challenge from Saktas who see the Goddess as the Absolute.

Sexual sadhana is a form of Tantra which has gained wide notoriety,
and indeed, represents the whole of Tantra to many people. Still, it is not
the norm in every Tantric tradition, and is not practiced in AM.

Sarkar draws a distinction between crude and subtle Tantric
practice, giving the example of pancamakara, but utilizing the five subtle
substitutes (drinking amrta instead of wine; control over the tongue instead
of eating meat; "eating the fish" that swim in the ida and pingala, that is
breath control, instead of eating actual fish; good company instead of
parched grain; and the union of kundalinii with Paramashiva at the highest
cakra, instead of sexual union) for the crude substances. Although the crude
variation is not taught in AM, Sarkar does say that "many people comment
adversely on the fifth M [sexual intercourse]. Through this process of
sadhana, people of cruder propensities can gradually develop self-restraint.
This is the teaching of Tantra, and nobody should object to it."
(Anandamurti, 1994: 50).

He does condemn certain other Tantra practices, such as the six
acts. "The power that is applied by degenerated Tantrics in the sat karma of
Tantra - that is psychically killing, dominating, stupefying, hypnotizing,
etc - has in reality nothing to do with spirituality." (Anandamurti, 1994:
29). In sum, it seems clear that for Sarkar, Tantra is a tool for welfare,
not for selfish ends.

At the heart, literally, of Tantra, is the role of guru.

"The disciple's heart is a field; sadhana is the ploughing and
irrigation of the field; and the preceptor's initiation is the sowing of
seeds." (Anandamurti, 1994: 39).

Brooks provides a compelling description of the guru- disciple
relationship. "The Tantric guru is both an existential ideal, perfect in
form and unaltering in nature, and at the same time, a creative, dynamic,
and performative being who, like Sakti herself, is both One and Many."
(Brooks, 1990: 138).

Performative is a good choice of words. If I may draw on my personal
experience for a moment, I observed that Sarkar had an extraordinary ability
to create "dramas" which forced the devotee to relinquish his or her
tight-fisted grip of ego and re-evaluate the way he or she interacted with
the world. He did this often in the role of organizational administrator.
Sarkar held "reporting sessions" on a regular basis, the ostensible purpose
of which was to hear about the progress of AM projects. But another level of
discourse altogether was occurring, in which Sarkar explored the karmic
burdens of those present, graced them with spiritual experiences, answered
questions which were often unvoiced, and rectified mistakes. Like Milarepa
who was pushed to the limit by his guru Marpa, Sarkar's punishments also are
claimed to have freed individuals from some of their karmic debt.

"Superior preceptors take meticulous care to ensure that their
disciples follow their teachings," Sarkar writes. "If they discover that
their disciples are negligent in any way, they compel them to practise more
painstakingly by applying circumstantial pressure." (Anandamurti, 1994: 40).

Here the Vaesnava influence comes to the fore. Devotionalism,
including kiirtan, the singing of the Lord's name, and pranipata, surrender
to the Cosmic will, is directed at the guru who is seen as an expression of
the Supreme Consciousness. Bhakti is the best way to liberation.
(Anandamurti: 1981: 7).

Acarya Dharmavedananda Avadhuta repeats an old refrain in his book
Who's Afraid of the Tantric Guru?: Â "If God and guru are standing before the
disciple, whose feet should the disciple touch first? The guru's because the
guru is the way to God, without which it would be impossible to ever meet
God. The disciple treats the guru not as an ordinary teacher, but as the
spiritual path itself." (Dharmavedananda, 1995: 5).

FORGING THE LINK

I'd like to begin moving now towards an understanding of how the
philosophy of AM makes the leap from individual to social, and encourages
the integration of Tantric practices with efforts aimed at social
liberation. Sarkar was a prodigious thinker, and wrote over 200 books on a
variety of subjects. These include a Bengali dictionary of over 6000
difficult words, English, Sanskrit and Bengali grammar books, writings on
agriculture, economics, education, history and civilization, health habits
and medical treatment, analysis of various spiritual scriptures, and
children's stories. He also composed 5018 songs during an eight year period.

Among these works is the philosophy of Neo-Humanism, which attempts
to draw the connection between the interdependent nature of the universe and
social accountability.

"All living creatures in this manifest universe are the children of
the same Cosmic Progenitor. Naturally they are bound in a thread of
fraternal relations. This is the central spirit. A socio-economic theory is
of no use but for this fraternal feeling." (Sarkar cited in Anderson and
Coyle, 1983: 101).

Ac. Vedaprajinananda Avt., in a booklet on this theme, writes that
"the higher possibilities of human nature demand that the mind be free to
expand and to flow towards the Supreme Consciousness. When this happens a
human being develops love for that Supreme and love for all other beings."
It is this connection and love which motivates one to serve others. Animals,
plants, and the environment also deserve our respect and care.

Sarkar also identifies limiting sentiments in the human mind which
tend to balkanize this connectedness, and suggests ways to expand the scope
of the mind beyond these identifications.

This is not a feel-good, "we are the world" outlook. It is critical,
writes Michael Towsey, for those engaged in this kind of project to analyse
the world of practical reality, observing that there are physical and
psychological differences between groups of people that must be catered for.
Then to return to a synthetic or universal outlook, armed with the necessary
practical knowledge to make social equality a reality. (Towsey, 1986: 198).

It may be instructive to briefly look at Sarkar's life in order to
understand how he moved from the spiritual to the social sphere.
Dharmavedananda writes that from 1955 Sarkar began training acharyas and
empowering them to teach the meditation lessons.

"He saturated his disciples in blissful experiences,frequently
demonstrating extraordinary psycho-spiritual phenomena. He induced different
states of super-consciousness in his disciples, caused individuals to die
and brought them back to life, and created special circumstances in which
they would hear divine sounds."

"This purely spiritual phase ended in 1962 when [Sarkar] began the
order of monks and nuns. Though his demonstrations continued, he now began
organizing massive social service programs. [His followers] threw themselves
into opening schools and welfare homes, and into catastrophe relief work...
Throughout this same period, the public was introduced to his socio-economic
theory, Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT)."

This theory is critical of both capitalism and communism, and is
based on the sense of cosmic fraternity noted above.

PROUT recommends rational distribution of the world's resources.
Sarkar envisioned self-sufficient decentralized economic zones with local
level planning providing full employment (to be constitutionally
guaranteed), an emphasis on cooperative industry, and ever-increasing
improvement in the minimum standards of living. He also encouraged the
development of high-caliber, ethical leadership; one way to develop this was
through spiritual sadhana. (Sarkar, 1983).

Since the mid-60's, Sarkar's followers have become active in
movements against exploitation and protecting the environment, worked to
introduce his ideas in the academic arena, and created sustainable
communities around the globe based on these spiritual and economic
principles.

Dharmavedananda continues:

"By [1969], Ananda Marga's influence had grown considerably. Half
the police commissioners of Bihar state were margiis as were many other
public officials...[Sarkar] had always spoken out against all forms of
corruption, and margiis in public positions began exposing the corruption
rampant in the administration at that time. In 1969... the central
government passed a ban order, forbidding civil servants to join AM... AM
filed a challenge in the Supreme Court and won the case, causing the ban to
be withdrawn. In complicity with the Central Bureau of Investigation, the
government concocted murder charges against Sarkar."

Sarkar was imprisoned for 7 years, five years of which he fasted. In
1978 when Indira Gandhi was voted out of office, he was released and
acquitted of all charges.

Sarkar often spoke about the inevitability of difficulties and
obstacles, which are "not to be feared or avoided; rather they are our
greatest friends on the spiritual path. To realize God, one must wage a
never-ending battle against the force of tamoguna, against avidyamaya, which
continually seeks to limit the expansion of consciousness." (Anandamurti in
Anandamitra, 1981: 203).

This is Tantra as struggle.

"Tantra is both an external and an internal fight. The internal fight is a
practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The external fight is a practice
of the cruder portion. The practice for raising the kundalinii is the
internal sadhana of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of hatred,
suspicion, fear, shyness, etc. by direct action is the external sadhana."
(Anandamurti, 1994: 27).

Dharmavedananda elaborates on this concept:

"Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring out,
rather than to bury, one's problematic mental tendencies... Â Only if a
spiritual aspirant, at least at some stage, deliberately seeks out fearful,
demoralizing or tempting circumstances in order to fight and overcome them
by Cosmic ideation and trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called
Tantra."

"A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous responsibilities
for social change. The disciples' participation in activist movements aimed
at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to confront sometimes
physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social censure and of the
overwhelming task before them." (Dharmavedananda, 1995: 437).

Thus, social activism - "the struggle" - is seen an integral part of
spiritual growth.

Such is clearly not the norm historically. As Goudriaan writes, "it
has been argued that Tantrism had rooted in a movement of the masses which
reacted against social ills and the excess of the established religion. But
the data at our disposal do not confirm this. ...Tantric sadhana... is a
purely personal affair concerning the individual self's release from the
bondage of existence. It did not try to direct its followers towards a
greater self-consciousness in these matters." (Gupta, Hoens and Goudriaan,
1979: 29).

However, one area in which this new Tantra does echo earlier
practice is in its anti-caste sentiment. Goudriaan notes that Tantric rites
are open to people of all castes and creeds, because all men are Siva and
all women are Sakti. "All varnas become Brahmans." (Gupta, Hoens and
Goudriaan, 1979: 32).

Not surprisingly, Sarkar comes out strongly against caste. In Ananda
Marga, marriages between castes and indeed, between nationalities, have been
the norm.

"The caste system is based on the principle of distinctions and
differences. This system has constituted the greatest obstruction to the
formation of a strong, well-organized, well-knit society. The caste system
is recognized by the Vedas only, not by Tantra. In the Tantric cult,
although there is cent per cent scope for a person's all-round development,
nevertheless, as human beings, all remain in an equal status. That is why
there cannot be any compromise between Tantra and the caste system."
(Anandamurti, 1994: 33).

"LIBERATORY AND THEREFORE POLITICAL"

In his article "Tantra as Episteme: A Pedagogy of the Future" Marcus
Bussey writes that Sarkar's vision encompasses an episteme that allows for
human potential to be expanded to include new ethical and spiritual
dimensions. "While Sarkar's is not a lone voice, it is a seminal one in the
effort to chart alternatives that are more creative and more fully attuned
to human aspiration and spirit." Part of this vision is of a Tantra
University, which was recently opened in Purulia District of West Bengal.

Bussey notes successful movies such as Star Wars have popularized
concepts central to Tantra such as self-perfection gained through
disciplined training and the existence of an all pervading 'force', which in
tantric literature would be called 'consciousness.' "What is unique about
the way Sarkar has redefined Tantra is that it gives very clear form to
these popularized images and fuses them in a spiritual and social agenda
that generates the energy and vision to begin the project of social
reconstruction." (Bussey, 1998: 11).

Modern Tantra, as Sarkar has defined it, is "specifically liberatory
and therefore political." Sarkar radically shifted the emphasis from the
individual to the collective by "linking the two so that neither could
progress without the other. Spirituality ceases to be selfish and becomes a
collective act....The individual works for their own liberation by following
specific practices, while at the same time struggling to free others from
physical, social and spiritual bondage. This brings to spirituality an
ironic tension in which the individual must engage with the world in many
ordinary and extraordinary ways." (Bussey, 1998: 13).

Sarkar as a Tantric guru created an intensely dedicated cadre of
full-time missionary workers. He developed a philosophy to underpin the link
between spirituality and social change, and propounded theories aimed at
socio-economic empowerment and liberation. And he taught Tantric practices
which aim at developing the human personality in all respects. All in the
context of an intensely dynamic organization.

What are we to make of all this? No doubt a number of questions
arise. Are these socio-economic ideas practical on a larger scale? Is this
simply another twist on the old oft-gone-wrong marriage of religion and
politics? There are no doubt many levels on which these ideas could be
critiqued. It is not within the scope of this paper to do so.

Sarkar's ideas are beginning to be discussed in a number of
important forums. Still, as Tantra is a practical science, perhaps the best
standard of evaluation is their effect on those who have embraced them. I
can say that on a personal level, I have gained, through my embrace of
Sarkar's approach to Tantra, both spiritual fulfillment and a welcome
radicalization on social issues. To the extent that they have empowered
thousands of people around the globe to work seriously for their own
spiritual growth and the welfare - social and economic as well as spiritual
- of others, one may say that Sarkar's ideas have earned a place at the
table of discourse on how we, as a society, are to best live in this fragile
world.
