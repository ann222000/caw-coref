Hey Dudes,
Who's doing what, when and why.

Yesterday I did a light wkout with free plates and today
I did 20 miles on a closed 1 mile course.

Every week will be the three days of weights and three
days of cycling.

AND, it's 95f here, the sweat pours.

Still a fat guy but I am working on it.

Yesterday (July 4, 2007):  Focus is rehab/repatterning, more ROM and
more flexibility in shoulders, getting glutes to fire better.

Joint Health work to warmup, including bodyweight-only versions of
pistols and windmills.

Standing one-arm kettlebell military press, 28 kg, 2 reps x 2 sets (each
side, of course, for all one-sided exercises)

Turkish Getup - 28 kg, 2 alternating singles each side, rest, 2 more of
same.

Bent press: 32 kg x 3 singles, 24 kg x 1

1-leg deadlift, 24 kg bell, using opposite hand and foot (e.g., left
hand and right foot) x 3, 3, 2 - very strict form, hips square to the
front, trying to &quot;repattern&quot; some things for myself.

Pullup: towel-assisted one-arm (thrown a towel over the bar, grab the
bottom with the non-lifting hand, stand sideways to the bar, pullup with
the other hand, rotating 90 degrees as you come up so that at the end,
your chin is over the bar at the lifting hand.  To collarbone and w/
brief pause at top each rep, x 4, 3, 3

(Had some friends over for dinner - they've been interested in kb's so I
brought a few out and demonstrated/taught, mostly swings but some other
things as well, and he's borrowing a 16 kg to start doing this on his
own.)

We don't need no stinkin' cardio.:)  Will hit kettlebell snatches
tomorrow.

Most weeks I ride my bicycle 20 miles a day with longer rides on the
weekend.  I swim a couple times a week. Last week I jogged a couple of
times (which I rarely do).

I try to lift every other day and do chest/shoulder/triceps one day
and squats/lats/biceps the other days. I spend about 45 minutes at a
time lifting (and listening to Jimmy Buffet or Bruce) in my garage.

This week was screwy as I wanted to run a 5K on the 4th and didn't
want to be tired for it and thought I'd take the day off following the
race.

Tonight I'll do chest, shoulders, triceps, and intervals on the
recumbent exercycle.  I might swim. I might put 20 miles on the
bicycle. I've got a lot of laundry to fold and a bunch of chicken to
grill before it goes bad.

Wednesday, July 4th, I ran in the first organized run I've been in
since, roughly, 1987. Back then I could run 10K and average 7:12 a
mile, which I think is OK since I weighed 220.  Yesterday I averaged
8:43 a mile (at 230 lbs) over 5K and the thought of running any
farther, well, it just wasn't there. (It had been my intention to do
chest/shoulders/biceps in the evening ... I opted, instead, to see Die
Hard again.)

Tuesday I swam laps.  I'm a horrible swimmer and am trying to develop
some sort of stroke. I've got to believe I look like I'm just
thrashing about in the water.  I thrashed around for 1/2 mile.

Monday I did squats, lat work, curls and ran 2 miles.

Sunday I rode the bicycle 50 miles.

Saturday I recovered from a Friday night High Intesity Interval Carbo
Loading Session that featured a lot of hops and grains.

Swimming is much more technique-dependent than running or bicycling -
take some lessons.  If you can do the &quot;Adult Advanced&quot; level at the

or still does swim competively.  I did a 30-minute lesson, once a week

There are also a set of videos from Total Immersion - they're somewhat

from them.  I've never used them so I can't say from personal

I've cut back to three days a week now, finally accepting the idea of
overtraining (having basically grown up on the Army's Physical
Training program, it was only old age which forced the realization).
For a while it had been a total body workout every other day, but now
I've even gone to doing separate muscle groups on the three workout
days, such that each is worked only once a week given the way I've
split things (chest/shoulders, back/arms, legs/abs -- though I tend to
do some abs each workout, since they don't seem to mind!)....

I'm due at the sports doc in about two weeks for an MRI 'cause I've
hurt my left elbow really bad while doing chin-ups and it's not gone
away for two months now!  Actually, it's a bit of an old problem, but
it always went away after a few days...now I think my whole left arm
is messed up since other muscles have stepped in to help
compensate...otherwise I'm one of the few good-looking folks in my gym
(looks only; actually numbers on a lift remain modest -- downright
puny, even, for my looks).

I'm going to post some photos once I find a way to disable user right-
clicking (or maybe I'll just crop the head or something) in order to
make a kind of public commitment to body sculpting and strength
training.  I've been doing the &quot;whatever floats your boat&quot; thing of a
young guy all these years, but at 35 going on 70 I feel like I've got
to get serious about this rocket science shit with nutrient timing and
overtraining and all that...so I'm going to do before and after photos
to see...right now my feeling is that I'm going to basically look the
same as I ever did, only with better definition and probably an inch
or two thicker biceps and chest...but we'll see....

As I get older and older I think I will not focus so much on
appearance (bodybuilding), such as size and definition, but on actual
strength and being able to do the work.  So I'm feeling very
optimistic about the rest of my life now, despite a kind of shock and
malaise earlier this year due to injuries and slow and shockingly
incomplete recovery....

I've stopped doing cardio now 'cause it's too hot and humid to run
(evenings, the mozzies all come out) and the gym, already kind boring
to begin with (like being on a hamster wheel, really), is so fucked up
they don't have air conditioning on and it's like a sauna (which in a
way I don't mind when I'm finally &quot;dialed in the zone&quot; but
still...)....

I miss cardio, but right now my thoughts are really taken up with
stuff like deadlifting and benchpressing...I have goals I want to
reach, and I'm making good progress, so I'm excited and that's all I
really am focused on...but when I think about it (like your post which
reminded me of it) I really miss the cardio after a good two hours of
lifting....

I've got a family reunion coming up at the end of the month and so I
am trying a protein sparing modified fast.  I've been happy up until
now to primarily use exercise to shape my body without making huge
changes to my diet, but I want to look ridiculously good for this get
together.  So I am trying something a bit more drastic.

Low carb diets make me feel sluggish and weak, so I have paired the
diet with a very basic weight training program.  This is what I did
last night:

|----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
| Exercise       | wgt | reps | wgt | reps |  tot |
|----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
| Deadlift       | 285 |    5 | 285 |    5 | 2850 |
| Bench Press    | 225 |    5 | 225 |    5 | 2250 |
| Pullup         | 228 |    5 | 228 |    4 | 2052 |
| Overhead Press |  65 |    5 |  65 |    5 | 1300 |
|----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
| Total          |     |      |     |      | 8452 |
|----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|

I then followed that up with a mile jog.  My basic goal for right now
is to not lose too much ground.  That's my Mon, Wed, Fri routine.
Tues, Thurs, Sat, I am doing kettlebell complexes with my 54
lbs. kettlebell.  I don't take any rest between exercises in a set.  A
typical set consists of:

1. Overhead squat (6 reps each hand)
2. One leg deadlift (6 reps each hand)
3. Bent over row (6 reps each hand)
4. Goblet squat (12 reps)
5. Clean (6 reps each hand)
6. Overhead press (6 reps each hand)
7. Snatch (6 reps each hand)

I do three sets with as much rest between sets as it takes for me to
feel like I can make it through the upcoming set :).  I probably
should move snatches up in the rotation as by the time I am on my
third set my snatch technique is somewhat shaky.

Of the things you're doing, I think I'd put cleans last since they're
probably the easiest.  I'd put the overhead press first, although the
weight is light enough for you that you can get away with it where it
is.

Another thought for you - I've seen people do a combination 1-leg DL and
row by rowing while standing on one leg at the bottom position.  Sounds
pretty brutal to me, haven't tried it yet, so don't consider this a
recommendation to try it. :)

Another way to do this, FWIW, is to put a few moves together on each
rep, e.g., clean, press (and lower), goblet squat - that's one rep.
Just a different way to put things together.  Do 6 reps each side of
that one multi-movement-thing and you've covered 3 of the things in your
list.  Might at least be a nice change of pace sometimes.  The
possibilities are endless, e.g., you could lower the weight at the end
of the goblet squat, snatch it overhead, and do an overhead squat.

What pace you keeping on the bike?

I like to do a full body weight workout every other day. Main goals are fat
loss first and a tad muscle growth second. Usually lasts about 40 minutes
with about 15-30 seconds rest btw sets. I use freeweights and machines and
mix things up. Also like bodyweight exercises like pullups, dips. I try to
keep my HR over 120 bpm the entire workout.

After that I do 30 minutes or more cardio, either on stationary bike or
elliptical, often throwing in some intervals at 90+% MHR for my age (max is
supposed to be mid 170's).

Living in SoCal, I try to ride my roadbike as much as possible but it's hard
to get out there in daylight hours. When I do ride, it's around 30 miles
with a 15-17 mph pace, including stoplights. (Used to do 21.5 mph overall
pace but those days are prolly gone.) If you like keeping data on your
riding, look at the Garmin Edge bike computer. Got one for father's day, and
it's an amazing gadget. And you can upload your data and get charts, maps,
etc. For ex: http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/3192511

Hang in there. I was down to 7% BF in my 30s with a nice beach bod, and
ballooned to a fat blob in the 30% range in late 40's with a BMI of about
31.5. Felt like shit, got sleep apnea, and felt all the shittier. Was
depressing to look at myself in the mirror. Lost 35 lbs of bodyweight since
then and prolly a bit more of fat. Feel/look much better and still headed in
the right direction.

What I've been doing recently has been a non-circuit circuit routine,
all bodyparts, pyramiding for four or five sets, about 15, 12, 12, 10,
8 reps. It's a rambling, Jeffy-from-Family-Circus-loops-around-town
circuit.

I'm not racing the clock, but simply moving around the gym hitting all
the bodyparts with the various machines
available at the local Planet Fitness. I finish every workout with
some time on the Life
Fitness treadmill.

When is three times per week.

And why is because I enjoy working out.

I've considered lessons; I think that's a good idea. I learned to swim
by reading a book back in 1969 or thereabouts.

To update what I did last night: Mid-afternoon I tweaked my back at
work (getting up from my desk to go to the can -- this getting old is
a bitch) and spent the evening sitting a lot a doing some exercised
I'd been given.  I did get the laundry folded and the chicken cooked.

&gt;&gt;&gt; some sort of stroke. I've got to believe I look like I'm just
&gt;&gt;&gt; thrashing about in the water.  I thrashed around for 1/2 mile.

&gt;&gt;-snip-

&gt;&gt;Swimming is much more technique-dependent than running or bicycling -
&gt;&gt;take some lessons.  If you can do the &quot;Adult Advanced&quot; level at the
&gt;&gt;local YMCA, treat yourself to a private lesson with someone who used
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;or still does swim competively.  I did a 30-minute lesson, once a week
&gt;&gt;for six months, and it forever changed the way I swim for the better.
&gt;&gt;There are also a set of videos from Total Immersion - they're somewhat
&gt;&gt;controversial among serious swimmers, but many folks report good
&gt;&gt;results
&gt;&gt;from them.  I've never used them so I can't say from personal
&gt;&gt;experience.

&gt;&gt;-S-
&gt;&gt; http://www.kbnj.com

&gt; I've considered lessons; I think that's a good idea. I learned to swim
&gt; by reading a book back in 1969 or thereabouts.

&gt; To update what I did last night: Mid-afternoon I tweaked my back at
&gt; work (getting up from my desk to go to the can -- this getting old is
&gt; a bitch) and spent the evening sitting a lot a doing some exercised
&gt; I'd been given.  I did get the laundry folded and the chicken cooked.
">

Tweaking your back like that - read McKenzie if you haven't already.
See

http://optp.com/index.cfm/pageid/203 - I have both the back book and the
combined, &quot;7 Steps ..&quot; book - they're all good, and they're all really
inexpensive, too. I think I paid $7 for the back book and it's up to a
whole $10 now.

As to swimming, I can't even begin to describe the difference the
private lessons made for me.  I also learned somewhere along the way,
basically joined a Y while in graduate school and learned from other
swimmers more than anything else.  When I took the Adult Advanced class
at the Y where I now live, I was already a lap swimmer but, as I'm sure
you know, there are just some people who make it look easy - smooth,
powerful strokes, seems like they could swim like that forever, and
they're fast, too.  Bottom line - the former competitive swimmer who was
my teacher taught me how to do all that for front crawl, and he even
taught me to do butterfly to the point where I still try to get in a lap
or two every time I swim, and people often now think I used to be on the
college swim team or similar - it's amazing what happens when the light
bulb goes off about swimming technique.  A lot of good swimming
technique can seem counterintuitive initially, but since we aren't fish,
I guess that kinda makes sense. :)

&gt; Hey Dudes,
&gt; Who's doing what, when and why.

&gt;    Yesterday I did a light wkout with free plates and today
&gt; I did 20 miles on a closed 1 mile course.

&gt;     Every week will be the three days of weights and three
&gt; days of cycling.

&gt;     AND, it's 95f here, the sweat pours.

&gt; Still a fat guy but I am working on it.
">

Keep working at it! Over the past 20 months, I've lost about 22kg of body
fat and gained maybe 5 or 6 kg of muscle mass (estimated!). For the first 3
months I hit the gym 3 times a week (no free-weights) and twice a week I
would do cardio for an hour or so. I also made changes to my diet (less
sugar, carbs, junk food - the usual suspects).  After 3 months I began using
free weights and went to the gym 5 times a week with an additional cardio
session on top of that. I'm now taking it a little easier and doing between
3 and 5 weights sessions a week depending on how my body is feeling. I also
do 1 cardio session a week. I was 104kg and am now just under 88kg  at 15%
body fat. My aim is to get to around 10-12% BF by November. For now, I'm
hibernating for the winter and loving it.

Yesterday was my last workout and I did chest:

Weighted Dips:
15xbodyweight (warmup)
10x20kg
10x25kg
10x30kg
8x30kg
7x40kg
6x45kg

Incline Press(Nautilus XPLoad Incline Press machine):
10x90kg
10x100kg
8x110kg
8x120kg
4x135kg

Flat Bench Press:
6x90kg
6x100kg
4x110kg
3x115kg

I also did some legs and abs:

45 degree Incline Leg Press:
10x180kg
8x200kg
8x220kg
8x220kg
6x240kg

Crunch Machine (Nautilus Nitro Plus Abdominal)
30x57kg
20x64kg
20x64kg
15x71kg
10x77kg

That took me about 90 minutes. I generally rest for 3 minutes on first 2
sets, 3:30 for middle sets, and 4 minutes on last sets. I did the leg press
between sets of Incline press and crunches with flat bench.

Steph.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Still a fat guy but I am working on it.

&gt;&gt; I've got a family reunion coming up at the end of the month and so I
&gt;&gt; am trying a protein sparing modified fast.  I've been happy up until
&gt;&gt; now to primarily use exercise to shape my body without making huge
&gt;&gt; changes to my diet, but I want to look ridiculously good for this get
&gt;&gt; together.  So I am trying something a bit more drastic.

&gt;&gt; Low carb diets make me feel sluggish and weak, so I have paired the
&gt;&gt; diet with a very basic weight training program.  This is what I did
&gt;&gt; last night:

&gt;&gt; |----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
&gt;&gt; | Exercise       | wgt | reps | wgt | reps |  tot |
&gt;&gt; |----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
&gt;&gt; | Deadlift       | 285 |    5 | 285 |    5 | 2850 |
&gt;&gt; | Bench Press    | 225 |    5 | 225 |    5 | 2250 |
&gt;&gt; | Pullup         | 228 |    5 | 228 |    4 | 2052 |
&gt;&gt; | Overhead Press |  65 |    5 |  65 |    5 | 1300 |
&gt;&gt; |----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|
&gt;&gt; | Total          |     |      |     |      | 8452 |
&gt;&gt; |----------------+-----+------+-----+------+------|

&gt;&gt; I then followed that up with a mile jog.  My basic goal for right now
&gt;&gt; is to not lose too much ground.  That's my Mon, Wed, Fri routine.
&gt;&gt; Tues, Thurs, Sat, I am doing kettlebell complexes with my 54
&gt;&gt; lbs. kettlebell.  I don't take any rest between exercises in a set.  A
&gt;&gt; typical set consists of:

&gt;&gt; 1. Overhead squat (6 reps each hand)
&gt;&gt; 2. One leg deadlift (6 reps each hand)
&gt;&gt; 3. Bent over row (6 reps each hand)
&gt;&gt; 4. Goblet squat (12 reps)
&gt;&gt; 5. Clean (6 reps each hand)
&gt;&gt; 6. Overhead press (6 reps each hand)
&gt;&gt; 7. Snatch (6 reps each hand)

&gt;&gt; I do three sets with as much rest between sets as it takes for me to
&gt;&gt; feel like I can make it through the upcoming set :).  I probably
&gt;&gt; should move snatches up in the rotation as by the time I am on my
&gt;&gt; third set my snatch technique is somewhat shaky.

&gt; Of the things you're doing, I think I'd put cleans last since
&gt; they're probably the easiest.  I'd put the overhead press first,
&gt; although the weight is light enough for you that you can get away
&gt; with it where it is.
">

By the time I get done with the Goblet squats and cleans I need the
relatively easy overhead presses so that my mind doesn't rebel at the
thought of doing snatches.  I'm generally blowing pretty hard by that
point, the presses let me catch my breath a bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another thought for you - I've seen people do a combination 1-leg DL
&gt; and row by rowing while standing on one leg at the bottom position.
&gt; Sounds pretty brutal to me, haven't tried it yet, so don't consider
&gt; this a recommendation to try it. :)
">

I probably could use the balance work.  I mainly mix in the deadlifts
because doing them without falling over is tricky.  I don't feel that
the actual lift requires that much work though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another way to do this, FWIW, is to put a few moves together on each
&gt; rep, e.g., clean, press (and lower), goblet squat - that's one rep.
&gt; Just a different way to put things together.  Do 6 reps each side of
&gt; that one multi-movement-thing and you've covered 3 of the things in
&gt; your list.  Might at least be a nice change of pace sometimes.  The
&gt; possibilities are endless, e.g., you could lower the weight at the
&gt; end of the goblet squat, snatch it overhead, and do an overhead
&gt; squat.
">

The possibilities definitely are endless.  My main goal is to just get
myself totally wiped out, and these seem to do a great job of that.
Wave a 54 lbs. weight around long enough and you start seeing stars.

They aren't much work for the big muscles, but they hit others muscles
in a good way.  I've recently been informed that for many, me included,
the toughest way to do them is opposite hand/foot, so that's what I do
now, e.g., a &quot;right&quot; side 1-leg DL is my right foot but picking up the
bell with my left hand.  Oh, so much fun.  Force yourself to keep
everything square - hips square to the front, other leg extended
straight back - and it gets to be even more fun.

I used to be a run/bike/swim guy, typically I rode 2-3 days a week,
maybe 50-100 miles a week.  Now I basically don't get on a bike except
for a few weeks in the summer in preparation for a thing we do as a
family every year, the Family Cycling Tour - link here:

http://jacolope.org/familycycling/index.php

I was a decent enough rider in my day - could take my fixed gear out on
the 'A' level rides, and used to do a morning hammerfest in the
summertime where we'd do an out and back, moderately hilly course at
6:30 am a few days a week and average 21-22 mph.

After I hurt my back, I got slowly back into run/bike/swim again, but
then discovered how much weight training was helping me, and eventually
discovered the Party, where we don't need &quot;the dishonor of dieting and
aerobics&quot; - all the high-rep kettlebell work keeps my resting pulse
actually a little lower than it was in my run/bike/swim days - I've got
a rest pulse of around 40.  I'm currently doing a pretty simple program
of low-rep strength training 3x/week and :30-on, :30-off 32 kg
kettlebell snatches for upwards of 20 minutes on the in between days.

20 minutes of kettlebell snatches?  Yikes.  Your hands must be pure
callous.  Seriously though, how many snatches do you do in 20 minutes?

&gt;&gt; 20 minutes on the in between days.

Nope, it's all about technique.  You learn to hold it, then loosen your
grip, then catch it again.  I find I actually get more callouses when I
deadlift regularly then I do from the kettlebell work.

The format is pretty simple - I typically pick a weight/rep combination
that I can do for only a few minutes and work it up to 20.  I'll go look
at my workout log, hang on ...  OK, some workouts from the last couple
of months:

June 18: 36 kg (80 lb.), 2L+2R on the minute for 16 min, 32/side or 64
total reps

May 24: 32 kg (70 lb.), mixed 3's and 4's on the minute for 21 min,
69/side or 138 total reps

Just in case you're misunderstanding, I'm not doing 20 minutes non-stop.
It's short set on short rests, &quot;on the minute&quot; means I start a new set
every :60 and just keep going that way.  The most I've done non-stop is
about 8 or 9 minutes with 20 kg, and 6 minutes with 24 kg.

I probably am not dropping the kbell properly.  When the bell twists
over the top of my hand on the downswing the skin at the top of my

I'll try loosening my grip (outside).

138 total reps is a lot.  Spreading that out over 21 minutes probably
helps some, but that's still a lot of reps.  Especially with a 32kg

This is very much an acquired skill, and there are not only multiple
approaches to it, each approach needs to be tempered by one's individual
strengths, weaknesses, abilities, etc.  The format of short sets on short
rests works well for me because the sets are short enough that a technique
experiment that isn't going terribly well is over soon after it started,
soon enough to generally not to cause any injury.

You know, I simply enjoy the work with the heavier weight more, but all the
research supports the idea that the cardiovascular benefit (as measured by
VO2Max and similar) is better with more reps of a lighter weight.  32 kg for
3's and 4's on the minutes is enjoyable in a beat-yourself kind of way, but
my last few workout have been w/ 24 kg and things like 10L+10R, which takes
about 1 minute, a 1 minute rest, and repeat - drudgery, these, and it almost
feels like the training is mental more than it's physical.

I think that part of the problem is that my current technique is &quot;good
enough&quot; for about 60 snatches in 5 minutes, and after that I am glad
for an excuse to quit :).

Exactly.  I know these workouts are good for me, but 10 minutes into
one of these workouts I start to realize why so many guys in the gym
spend their time doing bench presses and curls.  I am not sure
&quot;drudgery&quot; is the right word though.  I spent a few months cutting bad
spots out of potatoes in a food processing plant at one point in my
life.  That was drudgery.  Drudgery implies some level of boredom.
Twenty minutes of kettlebell snatches is torture, or perhaps
masochism, but it certainly isn't drudgery.

I tend to show off my kettlebell skills about once a week or so.
People see it in my office, or notice me carrying it around and they
wan to know what the heck I am doing with a cannonball with a handle.
The most common question I get after demonstrating snatches is, &quot;What
does that work?&quot;  I used to respond with, &quot;Everything,&quot; but I think
that from now on I might respond with, &quot;the mind.&quot;

Perhaps someday I will enjoy the pain.  In the meantime I simply try
and take some pride in the progress made.
