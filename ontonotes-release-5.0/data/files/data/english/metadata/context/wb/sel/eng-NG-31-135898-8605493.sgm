Linux users CRYING cause they don't have STEAM!
Simply PATHETIC!

STEAM represents everything Linux fights against
STEAM is PROPRIETARY, Linux is Open Standards
STEAM is RESTRICTIVE, Linux gives FREEDOM
STEAM is EXPENSIVE, Linux is AFFORDABLE
STEAM is MONOPOLISTIC, Linux gives CHOICE and creates COMPETITION
STEAM represents DICTATORSHIP, Linux represents true DEMOCRACY
STEAM is the &quot;Windows&quot;, and Valve the &quot;Microsoft&quot; of PC Games and
yet...
YET Linux users are CRYING like Babies cause TYRANT RUTHLESS DICTATOR
VALVE will not make a Linux version of STEAM!
PATHETIC!
PATHETIC!
PATHETIC!

So the conclusion is clear many Linux users are as DUMB, BLIND and
SHEEP like Windows users are.

Now if STEAM is stopping Linux users from running PC Games under
Linux, which I find totally expected cause leaving out and restricting
is precisely what STEAM does best, the only thing to do is join what
I've been doing since 2004, FIGHT AGAINST TYRANT VALVE and its
DICTATORSHIP PRISON STEAM!

PS: Now if you will use the fact I'm using Windows against me, let me
make this clear, my natural and obvious choice would always be Linux I
just don't use it cause I'm a PC Gamer and Linux is not enough Gaming
platform for me, so again I ask everyone working in the Linux market
to once and for all turn it also into a strong viable gaming platform
so many of us can finally leave Windows and join you, and no I'm not
talking about emulations I'm talking about a true optimized gaming
platform, I'm dying to use Linux, I'm just waiting for you guys to
turn it into a great gaming platform!

People want games on Linux. Most (all?) commercial games are
closed-source. You'll never have commercial games on Linux if you're an
open-source zealot who won't accept compromise, which is why the desire
to see Steam on Linux is fairly strong, since most people are reasonable.

You CAN run Steam in Linux, you just run it though Wine or Cedega. I've
tried it, the client works rather well after a few steps. The popular
stuff like Source/GoldSrc-based games work with varying levels of
success, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for long-term use.

I'm dangerously close to agreeing with pcgames here. There are
hundreds of games which run perfectly under linux, thousands more
which run perfectly in DosBox, and still more which run with varying
degrees of success under WINE.

I confess to being a bit of an open-source zealot, but even trying to
put that to one side I really don't see the need for Steam. Surely the
issue is that people want their favourite new games to run under
Linux, not that they want to be able to d/l and install them using
Steam?? The lobby for porting games I can understand much more easily,
but I don't see what a Linux Steam client would do for anybody. It
wouldn't make any of the games work any better than they do already.

Personally I already have more games than I will ever be able to play,
even if I never boot into Windows again. But if I wanted more games to
be available, I would want native Linux versions in shiny boxes with
nice manuals. Steam is neither here nor there.

I'd just like to end this post with the disclaimer that I still think
pc games is a complete plonker, even though I feel uncomfortably close
to his position on this one.

Hundreds of crap games. A few classic openGL ones such as UT2003, QIV

Steam is a SW protection thing isn't it? And a SW library and delivery
system? It seems quite useful to me. A bit like the .deb stuff under

That aint going to happen. Linux users do not, as a general rule, buy
games. See http://lokigames.com for more details. Its why more &amp; more
games makers are deserting Linux. Of course it doesn't help that HW
OpenGL is still only just working for a lot of ATI card owners and that
the sound sub system is a complete and utter mess between difference
distros.

I've given up caring about a Steam client too though. It would be NICE,
sure, but it's also unrealistic. A native Linux client is useless
without native Linux games to go along with it, and since there's only
about three games I know of on Steam that have Linux versions
(Introversion's stuff), that's stuff-all. So you're right, what's the point?

Like has been said, you can run Steam and some Steam-based games in
Linux, but that's a really bad idea IMHO. When an update to the Steam
client or the Source engine is released, it might work fine in Windows
but fuck up totally with Wine, which makes long-term use suck.

the lower overhead in Linux compared to Windows. I noticed a similar

Be careful. There are actually some COLA posters who maintain that Linux
is a far better gaming platform than windows. Aside from the lack of
commercial games, the trouble with the ALSA v OSS factions, the
departure of most game developers from OpenGL to DirectX, the closing of
LokiGames, the pisspoor nature of most native Linux games and the
reluctance of Linux users to actually pay for any games they might have
a point.

The majority of Linux users who solely use Linux really have no idea how
far Windows gaming has come or just how powerful the modern gaming cards
are.

Had the Linux community done more earlier to attract Games companies
then it might have been taken more seriously as an option for a home
OS. Unfortunately there is a hard core here who think gaming is for
pre-pubescent teenagers and not for far guys with beards who live in
their mother's basements.

What's interesting here is how you came to realise that it was stuck

?? That sounds like you believe that gaming is for fat guys with

The Linux community doesn't need to attract games companies. Linux is
free (both gratis and libre), and it would make little sense to try
and attract games companies who want/need to make a profit. There are
a ton of open-source games, which are the sort most ideologically

Linux doesn't need Steam either, for the same reasons. As a &quot;content

No. The majority are plain crap. Don't play the eye candy line.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people swear that many games run better in Linux via WINE due to
&gt;&gt; &gt; the lower overhead in Linux compared to Windows. I noticed a similar
&gt;&gt; &gt; situation with HL2 where it did seem to be running faster, until I
&gt;&gt; &gt; realized it was stuck in DX8 for some reason. Apparently you can
&gt;&gt; &gt; enable DX9 mode, but it sucks balls performance-wise, and I don't like
&gt;&gt; &gt; the idea of my hardware not being fully [utilised].

&gt; What's interesting here is how you came to realise that it was stuck
&gt; in DX8. Did it look noticeably less impressive? Or were you
&gt; consciously checking to see whether your hardware was fully utilised?

What are these potential performance increases of which you speak?

The last benchmarks I saw, saw DirectX under XP  crucifying OpenGL under
Linux in the framerate stakes. Which is not surprising since the games
companies put a lot more effort into optimising Dx support structures
than they for OpenGL since that's where the money is.

A modern game takes 10s if not hundreds of people to design, write, QA,
localise and distribute. There is simply no market for games by current
Linux users unfortunately.

Yes... Linux home users generally use software that's free (as in
beer), which is no good to the games software manufacturers.  And, as

hardcore gamers generally use consoles for gaming.

And the last benchmarks I saw showed OpenGL under Linux with some of the new

not hard, most games run faster under XP than Vista (unless of course you
are using proprietary Vista hardware/software combinations not available in
XP, yah I know, extinguish the flames before they start).  The point is that
MS is releasing bloatware OS packages that keep getting more and more
bloated, while Linux keeps the overhead minimized...

But most people will never know or care because MS has done a great job of
cornering the market when it comes to a PC operating system, which means
that if you want to make money you program towards the platforms with the
most numbers - consoles and Windows.  Can't see Linux ever getting through
the chokehold MS has on the market and getting out there as a true
mainstream platform without something pushing it there...  A killer Linux
app, or something that would give it some appeal other than the &quot;fun for the
enthusiast or tinkerer&quot; moniker that it gets stuck with now.

It's just too bad...  There is so much potential lurking there in Linux,
just waiting to be tapped.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When I was running my two-months Linux-only trial, I played a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite good, free games - particularly FPS. Two things I noticed:
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a) The vast majority of these games used Quake 3 as they engine (not
&gt;&gt;&gt; mods, standalone games)

&gt; This is the source of my guess above. I'm primarily a strategy fan, so

I don't give too much on eye candy, too. But hey, it's 2007, and even
the most crap-ass el-cheapo PC has some kind of 3D gfx. I don't want
some C64 gfx any more. Besides that the gameplay of most Linux games is
just a copy of some old classic. There's rarely something new.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands more

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, right. DOS games.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gotta LOL at that. :)

&gt; Why? They must be crap because they run in DosBox? We clearly have
&gt; totally different concepts of quality. Many superb games run in
&gt; DosBox: X-Com, MoO, MoM, Fallout ...
">

Yeah, how great. I already played them when DOS was current, and the
replay value of even the best games is finite.

Sadly, that's all regarding games on Linux: dozens of copies and remakes
of homecomputer-aera and mobile phone games and ways to play DOS games.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and still more which run with varying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees of success under WINE.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With usually a lot of fiddling and with very limited performance.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some people swear that many games run better in Linux via WINE due to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the lower overhead in Linux compared to Windows.
">

Sure. People swear a lot if they just believe hard enough. That's what
snake oil is for ;-)

And no, Linux doesn't have a &quot;lower overhead&quot; than Windows. That's just
wish-thinking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This thread - and indeed quite a lot of debate about Steam - seems to
&gt; be of interest mainly to people who want FPS eye candy games.
">

Don't think so. It's not about eye candy but that people aren't appealed
by mobile phone quality games any more, and also not by playing old DOS
games.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Linux community doesn't need to attract games companies. Linux is
&gt; free (both gratis and libre), and it would make little sense to try
&gt; and attract games companies who want/need to make a profit. There are
&gt; a ton of open-source games, which are the sort most ideologically
&gt; suited to the Linux environment, and of course the sort that run best
&gt; on Linux and have the best support.
">

That describes the Linux attitude quite well - ignoring the end user
wishes. Another reason why Linux on the desktop hasn't been the
breakthrough it was expected by the Linux community for several years now.

Linux has has had collaborative gaming almost since it's inception.
Granted, Empire wasn't exactly real-time 3D animation, and it took a
while for hardware to catch up to BZ-Flag, but these are two very good
examples of ways that Linux users have been able to join others in a
&quot;Community Game&quot;.

Sure, it's a bit like Jabber or IRC servers.  There are directories of
servers offering the game, and the registries are mirrored, which
means that it might take a day or two for a new server to hit the
registry mirror, but once it's online, it's not that hard to find.

Creating collaborative game servers isn't all that difficult.  You
have game clients, you have game servers, and you have a registry.
You could use UDDI (a wide-open Standard used in SOA applications for
business), or you could have your client connect to an LDAP server (or
have your LDAP server contact the game server's LDAP server.  The
servers register themselves with the registry server, and clients
contact the registry to see which servers have the game they want to
play.

It's certainly their choice to make STEAM a Windows only product.  But
then again, there is nothing to stop some college sophomore from
taking the public description of public protocols described in the
paragraph above, create an Open Source registry, and let Linux users
register their game servers.  FreeCiv, BZFlag, Poker, or whatever
else, all available for community play.

The games can be implemented using OpenGL code, which means that the
games can be played on Windows, Sony, Nintendo, Linux, and Mac.

Remember that company (Microsoft) who wanted to restrict their search
engine to &quot;Windows Only&quot; users.  And this other company (Google)
decided that they would make ANYBODY's content searchable?  How did
that turn out?

;-)

If the publisher wants to limit STEAM to &quot;Vista Only&quot; it's their
choice.
Of course, there are risks and consequences to that kind of choice.

It's a particularly bad niche for a games developer, because not only
are they starting with a small market (Linux desktop uses), a rather
vocal component of that market is strongly opposed to any closed source
software, so the game developer (if their game is not open source) will
have to put up with a lot of being badmouthed by people who consider
