Presumably with a PCD diamond tool.  Those can produce really

Could have been PCD, but it looked more like a natural diamond, or a
monocrystalline synthetic to my trained eyes and years of working with PCD,
natural, and monocrystalline diamonds, cutting aluminum.
PCD contains binders between the crystals, these binders are slightly
softer than the diamond particles. As the PCD tool cuts, the binders are
eroded away between the diamond crystals, causing a surface finish that has
microscopic defects (for lack of better terminology, scratches in the
surface finish).  This isn't true of natural diamonds, or monocrystalline
synthetic diamonds. In the mirror turning application, they wouldn't want
the microscopic surface defects PCD would produce.

While all that I have is a pair of PCD tips on diamond shaped
inserts -- and I still need to get shanks for that so I can actually
*try* them. :-) I keep hoping to find one at the local metalworking club
meetings, which always has a few people with things to sell.

Once I get that, I guess that I'll have to find some of the
alternative diamond inserts to try as well.

You'll love diamond in aluminum. Beautiful finish, run it fast, the chips
are hot though. (heat goes into the chip, not the tool)
Depending on the radius..here are some starting points for feeds/speeds.
General:
Spindle speed: Whatever you have available. I know of no manual, and very
few CNC machines that can provide enough spindle RPM on normal sized
workpieces that will get to the recommended SFM of PCD/Diamonds.
Depth of cut: Up to the length of what the PCD is on the tool. This is
radius dependent somewhat, as you don't want to totally bury a 0.4 mm R
tool, but it should be perfectly fine to bury anything over a 1 mm R,
depending on the direction of cutting. On small R tools, you want to
back-drag the tool, i.e. you want to rotate the insert so that the tool
tip is trailing the feed direction.
Ballpark Feeds (all values are metric):
0.1-0.5 = 0.05-0.08 mm/rev (fragile tip)
0.6-1.5 R = 0.15-0.3 mm/rev (agian, somewhat fragile tip)
1.6-2.5 R = 0.25-0.35 mm/rev
2.6-5.0 R = 0.35-0.5 mm/rev
5.0-8.0 R = 0.5-1.5 mm/rev

As for the insert holder, you _can_ make them. Not really difficult if
you have a milling machine. Use 4140 PH for the material, no further heat
treating required, but you can optionally bring them on up to 40-45 HRC.
I wouldn't recommend bringing them any higher, as you want ductility in
them.

Don, I'll disagree with Anthony on one point. If you want your toolholders
to stand up to commercial-type use, then 4140 is a good idea. But for a
home-shop machinist, who is gentler with his tools and who isn't likely to
strip threads on clamping screws, any steel, including free-machining types,
will do just as well, will be cheaper to make, and will be easier to
machine.

Your practical limitation is with the stiffness (Young's modulus) of the
steel, not its strength.

I couldn't find that insert on the Valenite site, what I found is DNMG-
432-F2. If those are what you have....

Those are ISO Negative inserts. A level pocket will not work, as you have
no clearance under the edge. You could relieve them, but that would
probably be difficult in a home shop without destroying the edge. You
need at least a 30 min primary relief on the pcd edge, then more under
(typically 7° or so). You can still make a holder, you just need to tip
the holder at a compound angle to generate the clearance angles.

Most all of the PCD tools I design have positive rake, as this is more
ideal for aluminum machining. Negative rake in Aluminum makes it want to
ball up on top of the tool, creating a built-up edge and premature edge
failure.

Normally you will have a 30' to 1° primary angle going 0.5 mm - 1 mm deep
from the top of the PCD, followed by 7-12° of secondary angle, depending
on application, and the rake angle chosen.

An 8° positive rake is a really good compromise between edge life and
cutting performance in softer aluminum alloys. If you are machining more
difficult high Si content alloys, you want to reduce the rake to 1-5°
because of the additional edge support offered by that design. High Si
alloys are extremely abrasive and will eat up the sharp edge created by a
higher rake in short order.

I might have something laying around here that you could use to play
around with...I'll look around tomorrow. Email me off the ng with your
contact info. Remember to take the sp out of the email address.

So I should do fine with 12L14 then, at least for initial

Granted -- there is a temptation to make a custom holder to fit

I was not talking about the screw which holds the insert to the
shank, but the setscrews which clamp the shank in the quick-change tool
holder.  I've seen various tools with shanks soft enough so the
setscrews put a series of dimples in the top of the shank -- which can
sometimes make it difficult to set a particular different extension of
the insert end out from the quick-change tool holder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That is what I am expecting, too.  Especially since I have seen
some of the cheap insert shanks (that is -- the shanks are cheap, but
the inserts are too expensive for what they are -- the sets of five
shanks and (if you are lucky) six inserts), I have seen the shank bend
beyond the mounting screw for the insert, so the insert is not properly
supported and breaks far too quickly.  This is the sort of thing which
the anvils are intended to prevent.

Thanks,
DoN.

That is one reason I prefer to design them with 4140. The holder won't
wallow out from the clamping screws as bad. Case harden is another
option. Another is if you bust an insert, it normally won't tear the seat
up as bad, sometimes not at all if you've brought it up into the low-mid
40's HRC.

I have yet to design a holder or PCD insert for a carbide seat. It just
weakens the holder and adds cost. We have 1 legacy insert type out of 30
or so styles we use that has a carbide seat. That insert is being phased
out because it's total operating cost is too high. We see absolutely no
difference in tool life with or without seats.  The only place I can see
it helping in this application is if you plan on crashing it often. In
that case, it does sometimes save the holder. (Not in an automated
production environment, but in a home or small shop on manual equipment,
it probably would....In an automated production environment, everything
is toast before you can even react.)

&gt; difficult high Si content alloys, you want to reduce the rake to 1-5°
&gt; because of the additional edge support offered by that design. High Si
&gt; alloys are extremely abrasive and will eat up the sharp edge created by a
&gt; higher rake in short order.
">

That suggests multiple holders to be changed depending on the
workpiece material.

Thanks -- though my e-mail address in the headers is valid
anyway.  I just haven't gotten around to munging my e-mail, since it has
been out there so long that it is already in the maximum possible number

BTW -- a Russian spamer has recently been found dead -- and
there are only 32 billion suspects. :-)

&gt; That is one reason I prefer to design them with 4140. The holder won't
&gt; wallow out from the clamping screws as bad. Case harden is another
&gt; option. Another is if you bust an insert, it normally won't tear the seat
&gt; up as bad, sometimes not at all if you've brought it up into the low-mid
&gt; 40's HRC.

O.K.  I probably can't case harden the 12L14 quite that hard or
deep enough, so I guess that it is 4140 after all.

&gt; &gt; Maybe the people who use them will chime in. My guess is &quot;yes.&quot; But
&gt; &gt; that's just a guess.

&gt; I have yet to design a holder or PCD insert for a carbide seat. It just
&gt; weakens the holder and adds cost. We have 1 legacy insert type out of 30
&gt; or so styles we use that has a carbide seat. That insert is being phased
&gt; out because it's total operating cost is too high. We see absolutely no
&gt; difference in tool life with or without seats.  The only place I can see
&gt; it helping in this application is if you plan on crashing it often.

Well I don't exactly *plan* on crashing it at all.  But you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This may be why you don't see any difference in tool life with
or without the anvils. :-)

Actually -- I *can* see a use for the anvils, given the
sensitivity of rake angle depending on workpiece material -- you could
have tapered anvils, like the ones used for threading inserts to adapt
to the helix angle. :-) This would reduce the number of holders
required.

Thanks,
DoN.

Heh.. Actually, crashes are pretty rare nowadays. It used to happen a
considerable amount, because of the automation. We have virtually
eliminated that root cause by re-designing the automation.
A crash these days is usually the result of one of the following in order
of magnatude:
1.) A broken bolt/screw/mechanism leading to a mis-clamp/un-clamp or
other part fixturing issue, normally due to cyclic fatigue.
2.) Insert failure due to lack of coolant.
3.) A defective raw part entering the system.

It would if you were changing materials a considerable amount, or using a
machine for multiple operations, such as in a home shop. That is not the
case with me though. Most all of our parts are made from high-Si alloy,
some just a lot higher than others. Our production machines and tooling
are dedicated to an operation. Very optimized, specialized set-up here.
We produce more than a half a million high precision aluminum parts per
month, generating around 100-150 metric tons of chips.

A simple sine table will do if you rotate the workpiece or the table.
For the accuracy required for a toolholder, tilting the workpiece in
the vise and rotating the vise would also work. A little math is
required to figure the angles to tilt and rotate, but we're all
grownups here &lt;g&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Don, I'll disagree with Anthony on one point. If you want your
&gt;&gt;&gt;toolholders
&gt;&gt;&gt;to stand up to commercial-type use, then 4140 is a good idea. But for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;home-shop machinist, who is gentler with his tools and who isn't likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;strip threads on clamping screws, any steel, including free-machining
&gt;&gt;&gt;types,
&gt;&gt;&gt;will do just as well, will be cheaper to make, and will be easier to
&gt;&gt;&gt;machine.

&gt;&gt;So I should do fine with 12L14 then, at least for initial
&gt;&gt;experimentation.

&gt;&gt;Granted -- there is a temptation to make a custom holder to fit
&gt;&gt;directly on the dovetails of a BXA/Series-200 toolpost -- perhaps even a
&gt;&gt;double-ended one similar to the BXA-16N which I use for standard
&gt;&gt;inserts, but customized for the 55 degree diamond shape of the PCD
&gt;&gt;inserts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Your practical limitation is with the stiffness (Young's modulus) of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;steel, not its strength.

&gt;&gt;At least for holding the inserts -- but for surviving the
&gt;&gt;setscrews which clamp the shank into the typical holder -- that is
&gt;&gt;another matter.  (Hmm ... case harden it, perhaps?)

&gt; If the load on the screw threads is that high then I would go back to
&gt; Anthony's suggestion and use a stronger steel to begin with. But unless
&gt; those threads are short or otherwise marginal, I find it hard to believe
&gt; that there would be any difference. Maybe Anthony has a better handle on
&gt; that.

&gt;&gt;For that matter -- should there be carbide anvils under the PCD
&gt;&gt;insert as there are for the normal carbide inserts?

&gt; Maybe the people who use them will chime in. My guess is &quot;yes.&quot; But that's
&gt; just a guess.

I bought a bunch of tool holder blanks a while ago that are for a
Monarch vmc150.  They were 4140 in the annealed state.  After we modify
them to the desired holder they are sent out to be hardened and
carborized.  That process seems to hold up better than just heat
treating them. The surface comes up to about 54 rc. and will not deform
under normal useage.
