Try reading the constitution you bigoted scumbag.

Before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, citizens of the states were
automatically considered citizens of the United States. In 1857, the Dred
Scott v. Sanford decision had held that no black of African descent (even a
freed black) could be a citizen of the United States. The Fourteenth
Amendment was thus necessary to overturn Dred Scott and to settle the
question of the citizenship of the newly freed slaves. The Fourteenth
Amendment made United States citizenship primary and state citizenship
derivative. The primacy of federal citizenship made it impossible for states
to prevent former slaves from becoming United States citizens by withholding
state citizenship. States could no longer prevent any black from United
States citizenship or from state citizenship either.

The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had previously asserted that "All persons born
in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians
not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States." The
immediate impetus for the Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize and
validate the Civil Rights Act because some had questioned whether the
Thirteenth Amendment was a sufficient basis for its constitutionality. A
constitutional amendment would also have the advantage of preventing a later
unfriendly Congress from repealing it.

One conspicuous departure from the language of the Civil Rights Act was the
elimination of the phrase "Indians not taxed." Senator Jacob Howard of Ohio,
the author of the Citizenship Clause, defended the new language against the
charge that it would make Indians citizens of the United States. Howard
assured skeptics that "Indians born within the limits of the United States,
and who maintain their tribal relations, are not, in the sense of this
amendment, born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States." Senator
Lyman Trumbull, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported
Howard, contending that "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" meant "not
owing allegiance to anybody else . . . subject to the complete jurisdiction
of the United States." Indians, he concluded, were not "subject to the
jurisdiction" of the United States because they owed allegiance-even if only
partial allegiance-to their tribes. Thus, two requirements were set for
United States citizenship: born or naturalized in the United States and
subject to its jurisdiction.

By itself, birth within the territorial limits of the United States, as the
case of the Indians indicated, did not make one automatically "subject to
the jurisdiction" of the United States. And "jurisdiction" did not mean
simply subject to the laws of the United States or subject to the
jurisdiction of its courts. Rather, "jurisdiction" meant exclusive
"allegiance" to the United States. Not all who were subject to the laws owed
allegiance to the United States. As Senator Howard remarked, the requirement
of "jurisdiction," understood in the sense of "allegiance," "will not, of
course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners,
aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers
accredited to the Government of the United States."

Most revealing, however, was Senator Howard's contention that "every person
born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their
jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the
United States." Almost everyone certainly would have understood "natural
law" to refer to the social compact basis of citizenship, the basis for
citizenship adumbrated in the Declaration of Independence.

The argument of the Declaration grounded citizenship in consent. The natural
law argument of the Declaration was a repudiation of the notion of
birthright citizenship that had been the basis of British citizenship (i.e.,
being a British "subject") ever since it was first articulated in Calvin's
Case in 1608. Sir William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of
England, had argued that the idea of birthright citizenship was an
inheritance from the "foedal system"-it derives from the "mutual trust or
confidence subsisting between the lord and vassal." "Natural allegiance,"
says Blackstone, is "due from all men born within the king's dominion
immediately upon their birth. [It] is a debt of gratitude which cannot be
forfeited, cancelled, or altered, by any change of time, place or
circumstance. . . . [T]he natural-born subject of one prince cannot by any
act of his own, no, not by swearing allegiance to another put off or
discharge his natural allegiance."

In the Summary View of the Rights of British America (1774), Thomas
Jefferson argued that it was a natural right possessed by all men to leave
the country where "chance and not choice" had placed them.  The act
provided, in pertinent part, that "the right of expatriation is a natural
and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the
rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Senator Howard was
an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, describing the right of expatriation
as the necessary counterpart of citizenship based on consent.

In Elk v. Wilkins (1884), the Supreme Court decided that a native Indian who
had renounced allegiance to his tribe did not become "subject to the
jurisdiction" of the United States by virtue of the renunciation. "The alien
and dependent condition of the members of the Indian Tribes could not be put
off at their own will, without the action or assent of the United States"
signified either by treaty or legislation. Neither the "Indian Tribes" nor
"individual members of those Tribes," no more than "other foreigners" can
"become citizens of their own will."

Beginning in 1870 Congress began extending offers of citizenship to various
Indian tribes. Any member of a specified tribe could become an American
citizen if he so desired. Congress thus demonstrated that, using its Section
5 powers to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, it could
define who was properly within the jurisdiction of the United States.

In 1898, the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark declared that
the Fourteenth Amendment adopted the common-law definition of birthright
citizenship. The decision conferred birthright citizenship on a child of
legal residents of the United States. of legal residents of the United
States. The language of the majority opinion in Wong Kim Ark is certainly
broad enough to include the children born in the United States of illegal as
well as legal immigrants.

&gt;&gt; of Confederation.  In the latter,  ex-slaves or their dependents
&gt;&gt; automatically fell within the jurisdiction of their state of
&gt;&gt; residence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Fourteenth
&gt;&gt;&gt; Amendment made United States citizenship primary and state
&gt;&gt;&gt; citizenship derivative. The primacy of federal citizenship made it
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible for states to prevent former slaves from becoming United
&gt;&gt;&gt; States citizens by withholding state citizenship. States could no
&gt;&gt;&gt; longer prevent any black from United States citizenship or from
&gt;&gt;&gt; state citizenship either.

&gt;&gt; The 14th A. removed the legal status of slavery as property and the
&gt;&gt; impediments of state law rendering ex-slave residents as bona fide
&gt;&gt; citizens.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had previously asserted that &quot;All
&gt;&gt;&gt; persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign
&gt;&gt;&gt; power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens of the United States.&quot; The immediate impetus for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize and validate the Civil
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rights Act because some had questioned whether the Thirteenth
&gt;&gt;&gt; Amendment was a sufficient basis for its constitutionality. A
&gt;&gt;&gt; constitutional amendment would also have the advantage of preventing
&gt;&gt;&gt; a later unfriendly Congress from repealing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One conspicuous departure from the language of the Civil Rights Act
&gt;&gt;&gt; was the elimination of the phrase &quot;Indians not taxed.&quot; Senator Jacob
&gt;&gt;&gt; Howard of Ohio, the author of the Citizenship Clause, defended the
&gt;&gt;&gt; new language against the charge that it would make Indians citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the United States. Howard assured skeptics that &quot;Indians born
&gt;&gt;&gt; within the limits of the United States, and who maintain their
&gt;&gt;&gt; tribal relations, are not, in the sense of this amendment, born
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Senator
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lyman Trumbull, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported
&gt;&gt;&gt; Howard, contending that &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; meant
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;not owing allegiance to anybody else . . . subject to the complete
&gt;&gt;&gt; jurisdiction of the United States.&quot; Indians, he concluded, were not
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of the United States because they owed
&gt;&gt;&gt; allegiance-even if only partial allegiance-to their tribes. Thus,
&gt;&gt;&gt; two requirements were set for United States citizenship: born or
&gt;&gt;&gt; naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction.

&gt;&gt; Indian tribes were recognized as sovereign entities and their members
&gt;&gt; foreign or alien for the purposes of the Constitution.

&gt;So today they can be arrested without charge, &quot;specially rendered&quot; to
&gt;Guantanamo, or a secret CIA prison, tortured, and held indefinately
&gt;without any rights or protections of due process under US Constitutional
&gt;or International law, eh?

"Arrested"?  The Feds don't need no stinkin' arrest!

Nothing special is needed. Under the infamous Patriot Act your ass can
be made to disappear in a heartbeat.  Anyone with knowledege of this
event is then forbidden to report or speak of it.

Here is one section from the infamous Patriot Act as passed
into law by the US Congress in 2001.

Ask the Patriot Act, "what is a terrorist"?

Section 802 reads that you are a terrorist if the president
or his designee so declares, period.

Note that this document specifies that a terrorist may be *any* person
so designated by the Secretary of State or the Attorney General OR,
*any* person suspected of violating any federal or state criminal law
OR *any* person suspected of actually or intending to, intimidate or
coerce any person.

In others words, any person suspected of a crime can be designated a
terrorist.

Here's the law...

++++++++++++++

SEC. 802. DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

(a) DOMESTIC TERRORISM DEFINED- Section 2331 of title 18,
United States Code, is amended--

(1) in paragraph (1)(B)(iii), by striking `by assassination
or kidnapping' and inserting `by mass destruction,
assassination, or kidnapping';

(2) in paragraph (3), by striking `and';

(3) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and
inserting `; and'; and

(4) by adding at the end the following:

`(5) the term `domestic terrorism' means activities that--

`(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation
of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;

`(B) appear to be intended--

`(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

`(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation
or coercion; or

`(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass
destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and

`(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of
the United States.'.

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 3077(1) of title 18, United
States Code, is amended to read as follows:

`(1) `act of terrorism' means an act of domestic or
international terrorism as defined in section 2331;'.

++++++++++++++

Comments:

Terrorism then is any activity that may:

`(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation
of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;

...or an act that may:
`(B) appear to be intended--

`(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

`(ii) to influence the policy of a government by
intimidation or coercion; or

`(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass
destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and

`(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction
of the United States.'.

Which could apply to any criticism of government or politicians
or half of the material on the NGs.

Note the wording for amending  Section 3077(1) of title 18,
United States Code, it is is amended  to read:

`(1) `act of terrorism' means an act of domestic or
international terrorism as defined in section 2331;'.

Which effectively means that "domestic" terrorism is the same as
"international" terrorism.

Further as we see in Sec.411 below, that a terrorist is ...

`(aa) a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the
Secretary of State under section 219, or

`(bb) a political, social or other similar group whose public
endorsement of acts of terrorist activity the Secretary of
State has determined undermines United States efforts to
reduce or eliminate terrorist activities,';

Summary of this portion of Section 802 - A terrorist is any
person suspected of violating any federal or state criminal
law OR any person suspected of actually or intending to,
intimidate or coerce any person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, citizens of the

&gt;&gt; person so designated by the Secretary of State or the Attorney
&gt;&gt; General OR, *any* person suspected of violating any federal or state
&gt;&gt; criminal law OR *any* person suspected of actually or intending to,
&gt;&gt; intimidate or coerce any person.

&gt;&gt; In others words, any person suspected of a crime can be designated a
&gt;&gt; terrorist.

&gt;&gt; Here's the law...

&gt;&gt; ++++++++++++++

&gt;&gt; SEC. 802. DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

&gt;&gt;   (a) DOMESTIC TERRORISM DEFINED- Section 2331 of title 18,
&gt;&gt;         United States Code, is amended--

&gt;&gt;   (1) in paragraph (1)(B)(iii), by striking `by assassination
&gt;&gt;       or kidnapping' and inserting `by mass destruction,
&gt;&gt;       assassination, or kidnapping';

&gt;&gt;   (2) in paragraph (3), by striking `and';

&gt;&gt;   (3) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and
&gt;&gt;       inserting `; and'; and

&gt;&gt;   (4) by adding at the end the following:

&gt;&gt;  `(5) the term `domestic terrorism' means activities that--

&gt;&gt;  `(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation
&gt;&gt;       of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;

&gt;&gt;  `(B) appear to be intended--

&gt;&gt;  `(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

&gt;&gt;  `(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation
&gt;&gt;        or coercion; or

&gt;&gt;  `(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass
&gt;&gt;         destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and

&gt;&gt;   `(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of
&gt;&gt;        the United States.'.

&gt;&gt;    (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 3077(1) of title 18, United
&gt;&gt;        States Code, is amended to read as follows:

&gt;&gt;   `(1) `act of terrorism' means an act of domestic or
&gt;&gt;         international terrorism as defined in section 2331;'.

&gt;&gt; ++++++++++++++

&gt;&gt; Comments:

&gt;&gt; Terrorism then is any activity that may:

&gt;&gt;  `(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation
&gt;&gt;       of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;

&gt;&gt; ...or an act that may:
&gt;&gt;        `(B) appear to be intended--

&gt;&gt; `(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

&gt;&gt; `(ii) to influence the policy of a government by
&gt;&gt;       intimidation or coercion; or

&gt;&gt; `(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass
&gt;&gt;        destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and

&gt;&gt;  `(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction
&gt;&gt;      of the United States.'.

&gt;&gt; Which could apply to any criticism of government or politicians
&gt;&gt; or half of the material on the NGs.

&gt;&gt; Note the wording for amending  Section 3077(1) of title 18,
&gt;&gt; United States Code, it is is amended  to read:

&gt;&gt; `(1) `act of terrorism' means an act of domestic or
&gt;&gt;      international terrorism as defined in section 2331;'.

&gt;&gt; Which effectively means that &quot;domestic&quot; terrorism is the same as
&gt;&gt; &quot;international&quot; terrorism.

&gt;&gt; Further as we see in Sec.411 below, that a terrorist is ...

&gt;&gt;  `(aa) a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the
&gt;&gt;        Secretary of State under section 219, or

&gt;&gt;  `(bb) a political, social or other similar group whose public
&gt;&gt;       endorsement of acts of terrorist activity the Secretary of
&gt;&gt;       State has determined undermines United States efforts to
&gt;&gt;       reduce or eliminate terrorist activities,';

&gt;&gt; Summary of this portion of Section 802 - A terrorist is any
&gt;&gt; person suspected of violating any federal or state criminal
&gt;&gt; law OR any person suspected of actually or intending to,
&gt;&gt; intimidate or coerce any person.

&gt;&gt; continuing...

&gt;&gt; +++++++++++++

&gt;&gt; SEC. 411. DEFINITIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.

&gt;&gt;     (a) GROUNDS OF INADMISSIBILITY- Section 212(a)(3) of the
&gt;&gt;         Immigration and Nationality Act  (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3))
&gt;&gt;         is amended--

&gt;&gt;        (1) in subparagraph (B)--

&gt;&gt;       (A) in clause (i)--

&gt;&gt;       (i) by amending subclause (IV) to read as follows:

&gt;&gt;      `(IV) is a representative (as defined in clause (v))
&gt;&gt;                                                of--
&gt;&gt;  `(aa) a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the
&gt;&gt;        Secretary of State under section 219, or

&gt;&gt;   `(bb) a political, social or other similar group whose public
&gt;&gt;         endorsement of acts of terrorist activity the Secretary
&gt;&gt;         of  State has determined undermines United States
&gt;&gt;         efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activities,';

&gt;&gt;   (ii) in subclause (V), by inserting `or' after `section 219,';
&gt;&gt;        and

&gt;&gt;   (iii) by adding at the end the following new subclauses:

&gt;&gt;  `(VI) has used the alien's position of prominence
&gt;&gt;           within any country to endorse or espouse terrorist

Wow! What an accomplisment. The big 'ol 300 million pop. U$$A managed to
surpass a carribean island nation of 11 million people that was until
1959 completely controlled, run and expolited by U$ Mafia Criminal Scum,
and since 1963 had been under the jackboot of overt and covert U$ attacks
and a crippling economic embargo.

Yet, somehow, Cuba managed to develope some of the highest standards for
medicine and health care of ANY nation in the WORLD, and has standards
of living FAR exceeding their nearest island nation neighbors, the
capitalist democratic neighbors that have has decades of DIRECT U$
involvement and manipulation and control, and who have the LOWEST
standards of living and highest poverty, disease and crime of any nation,
in the Americas.

So why do you hate the Cuban people so much, eh chump?
