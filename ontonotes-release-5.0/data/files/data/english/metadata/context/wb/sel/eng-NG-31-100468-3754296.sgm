The Dwarf Planets 2003 UB313, Pluto and Ceres have been proclaimed
dwarf planets. 2003 UB313 is the designation of a large transneptunian
object that was to become our "10th planet" on account of its size.
Larger than Pluto, the object provoked Pluto's downgrade from planet
status. Pluto's demise marks the birth of a new class of planets. The
dwarf planets like 2003 UB313 or 2005 FY9 already have their
delineation in the 12 astrologic houses.

Dwarf Planets in Love

Dwarf planets for lovers, kids and even pets! Largest dwarf planet 2003
UB313 as
delineated in the 12 astrological houses. Get rich with ex Planet X and
Bill Gates in 2007!

Add to Chart and the "10th Planet" Jubilee

The former "10th planet", now largest dwarf planet 2003 UB313
celebrates its first
birthday with Add to Chart Publications. The first astrologic
publication on 2003 UB313 was published as early as August 1st 2005,
only days after its official announcement. We immensely enriched the
world of astrology and personal magick ever since. One of the results
of our study was the special "X Zodiac" for 2003 UB313. Our
publications teach
the initiate how to scan as well as change any future event with
dignity and competence.

Scientific Astrology

One of the best ways to get acquainted with zodiacal reformation is our
standard grey
cover publication on the basic principles of scientific astrology. You
will get acquainted
with the basic astronomic zodiac and current set of sixteen precessed
ascendants as well.

Venus in Special Constellations

Venus was in Orion in summer 2006. It will be in Hydra next summer. Is
your Venus in
Scutum or perhaps Pegasus? Is your astro-love from Venus? Then this
book is for her!.108 Points in Astrology
An early treatise consisting in 108 points pro scientific astrology.
This collection of short
notes served as manifest of the reformation and is still a valid manual
for the astrologer.
I Ching Aspectarian
This precious volume contains the secrets of astrological prediction.
Your transits and
progressions filter new ranges of meaning when processed with I Ching
Aspectarian.
Cassini Lilith
What do we learn on the secret observation of the damned moon with
apocalyptic as well
as openly sexual portents? True Lilith was observed in Italian and
German priests as well.

The Dark Planets

We came across a set of seventeen hypothetical planets by sheer chance.
We loved them,
used them and wrote their delineation. Lamia, Ops and Hastur enliven
the horoscope with
the forbidden flavor of our first astrological experiments beyond
Neptune and Pluto.

Real Time Reality Rendering Tools

Ever wanted to cure or do a miracle but you never had the time?
Wonderworkers can
perform an instant intervention in the texture of the event matrix
bringing health, love and
peace to this plane. Sometimes it takes minutes to create favorable
circumstances. The
RTRRT represent instant daily life magick from simple techniques like
Cascade and O5
to the supreme magickal gadget of the Personal Cosmic Secretary. With
your P.C.S. the
daily experiences arrange by themselves as if enchanted by a fairy
while with Snow
Crash your wish comes true in minutes. Meet that person, find parking,
cure an illness or
get some extra bonus from life today with RTRRT. People used the RTRRT
to get job,
cure cancer, find love, get audience, win at the casino or get through
a difficult
astrological transit. Astrologers, occultists and laymen use the RTRRT
with their transits,
produce a favorable turn in circumstances before any bad transit
happens. Why suffer a
difficult transit when you can program your life ahead with RTRRT? And
don't let fate,
karma or bad habit stand on your way. No bad transits at all with
reality rendering tools!

What are the dwarf planets? The first three dwarf planets to be
acknowledged by the IAU
are 2003 UB313, Pluto and Ceres. Size matters but also other factors do
so that a major
body such as 2003 EL61 might not qualify for the title of one of the
largest dwarf planets
simply due to its shape being all but round. The precise definitions by
IAU as follow.

Begin quote
RESOLUTION 5A
The IAU therefore resolves that "planets" and other bodies in our Solar
System be defined into
three distinct categories in the following way:
(1) A "planet" /1 is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the
Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for
its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a
hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly
round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
(2) A "dwarf planet" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around
the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass
for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a
hydrostatic equilibrium
(nearly round) shape /2 , (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around
its orbit, and (d) is not a
satellite.
(3) All other objects /3 except satellites orbiting the Sun shall be
referred to collectively as "Small
Solar-System Bodies".
/1 The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune.
/2 An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into
either dwarf planet and
other categories.
/3 These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most
Trans-Neptunian Objects
(TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.
End quote

The definition may appear plain where it certainly is not simple at
all. While waiting
For the official nomination of further dwarf planets we shall propose
some of the bodies
from the following list as generated by the NASA JPL HORIZONS online
integrator..JPL/DASTCOM3

Most of these objects were delineated in the past year and published
whetner in dedicated or
common publications.
Some of the largest objects from the following list may be proposed for
dwarf planets.

Charon may be included in the list. We shall retain the historical
classifications at least
for a while since we are accustomed to classify objects by their
relative location thus the
following example giving a rough idea of previous classifications.

Apoheles
Earth Coorbitals
Atens
Apollos
Amors
Planets
Main Belt Comets
Main Belt Asteroids
Centaurs
Comets
Damocles
TNO
KBO
SDO
Cubewano
Plutino

Some of the classifications are official such as TNO and some merely
convenient like
Damocles-like objects. An object can be reclassified in time, even
years from its
discovery! The above tables sort objects by brightness, roughly meaning
size as concern
minor planets, a category that would encompass most of the above
objects and classes..In our own time we have been accustomed to use
other "classifications" such as "outer
guardians" for objects with extreme period like the actual 2006 HW51.
A note for astrologers
Astrologers often use programs with poorly updated orbital elements for
the asteroids.
The main belt asteroids can actually be several degrees from the
position as calculated by
an average program. This is of course but a minor problem when it comes
to precision
versus superstition and we must close this comment at that.
In waiting for further decisions from the IAU we recommend the use of
the astronomic
zodiac as opposed to simple practical superstition while we wait for
its introduction in the
IAU files.
Klaudio Zic
31 August, 2006.Dwarf Planets and Zodiacal Reformation
Copyright (c) 2006 by Klaudio Zic, all rights reserved.
http://www.lulu.com/astrology
The August 2006 IAU Resolution reorganized the classes of objects we
called cubewano,
plutino, SDO, Earth coorbitals or Apoheles in three distinct classes of
objects of which
the most interesting seems to be the "dwarf planets". 2003 UB313, Pluto
and Ceres are
officially "dwarfs" while 2005 FY9 and the rest are awaiting
membership. What has
changed for the serious astrologer?
"
The delineation for the dwarf planets and "Small Solar-System Bodies"
has not
changed. Whether the object changed designation, classification, name
or even nature
does not change its delineation. Whatever giant TNO, comets, centaurs
or minor
planets we delineated in the past years, their delineation remains the
same. This is
especially true for 2003 UB313 or "Xena", the major dwarf planet.
"
The ascending constellations remain the same. At this epoch we have
only 16 true
eastern IAU constellations rising in due east. The number doubles in
other epochs.
"
Pluto never entered Aries. The nature of the dwarf planet makes it
slide from
Aquarius and through Cetus well into Taurus. Pluto never entered Pisces
or Aries.
One could not but laugh with disbelief at the very important gentlemen
who decided
that Pluto "presides over Aries". Pluto co-rules Cetus with 2003 UB313
and Sedna.
"
Pluto was incapable at confirming the aspects that astrologers expected
from a
planet. It never really made an opposition with Mars albeit the
projections would have
it. Its orbit prevented it to behave like a circumspect planet.
"
So where was Pluto at the time its long pending fate was sealed? Pluto
spent its
last years in Ophiuchus before entering Serpens Cauda. It never entered
Sagittarius as
planet again. The last significant aspect it made sealed the future of
the planet on July
4
th
2006. Serpens Cauda happens to be the eastern ascendant of the U.S.A.."
The "P Zodiac" is no longer valid. This means that e.g. Bootes is no
longer a
zodiacal constellation. We are left with the so-called "N Zodiac" or
Neptunian zodiac.
This astronomic zodiac consists of 24 IAU constellation. When we say
that Venus is
in Orion in summer 2006 we use the astronomic zodiac. Further examples
are the
current entry of Jupiter into Ophiuchus as well as Venus in Hydra in
summer 2007.
"
In the opinion of the very few authorities that unofficially attempted
at defining
the astronomic zodiac, the Moon traditionally co-defines the zodiac.
This e.g.
immediately makes the IAU constellation of Auriga zodiacal. If in its
own time the
IAU votes against the Moon defining the zodiac then Auriga would not be
zodiacal.
Since Venus has the habit of dropping from Pegasus through Pisces and
into Cetus
this defines Pegasus, Pisces and Cetus as zodiacal constellation.
"
The "X Zodiac" is fortunately not valid, too. It had so much
constellations! If
"Xena" would be planet astrologers just could not cope with over 40
constellations in
their wheel charts. It will be a long time before Lynx becomes a
zodiacal station,
much longer than it takes for Lynx to become eastern ascendant again..

The Dwarf Planets by Klaudio Zic

Below is a list of largest minor planets in the solar system with
potential dwarf
planets among them. 2003 UB313, Pluto and Ceres are officially dwarf
planets. The
site http://www.lulu.com/astrology hosts the delineation for all dwarf
planets.

Astrological delineation is available for all major transneptunian
objects. The
delineation is in its original form at the time of the discovery and
before the
object in question was given a name. Delineation is available for 2003
UB313
in Cetus; Pluto in Coma Berenices, Bootes, Serpens and Ophiuchus; 2003
EL61 and 2005 FY9 in Coma Berenices, Sedna in Cetus, Orcus in
Hydra,.Quaoar in love, finance and magick, Varuna and 2002 AW197 as
real estate
cubewano. All delineation is set for the 12 astrological houses.
The new IAU standards have 2003 UB313, Pluto and Ceres for "dwarf
planets". The new class of
planets is now official with 2005 FY9 probably as first elected
candidate to join the historical trio.
www.lulu.com/astrology already hosts the delineation for the future
dwarf planets from the time of
their discovery when the classes of TNO were named cubewano, plutino or
SDO. Transneptunian
giants like Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, Ixion or Varuna have their early
delineation in a publication nam
Transneptunian Objects in Astrology. The Dwarf Planets series is thus
an ennobled revision of the
early delineation for the future dwarf planets in astrology.

It seems astrologers lost something they never had. The object's name
is still Pluto as it
joins Jupiter in Ophiuchus this year. Jupiter might be another planet
they never had as
concern position and angular aspect. What we did have for a long time
is the collection of
dwarf planets. The little big ones have been delineated in the 12
astrological houses as
soon as they were discovered. This refers mainly to 2003 UB313 that was
nicked "Xena"
or "10
th
planet" a year ago. We were of course aware that Pluto is not a planet
many years
ago as official decisions naturally lag behind discoveries. The Chinese
may be aware of
the fact that there are eight planets by a sole glance at I Ching
Aspectarian system.
While there is still place for dwarf planets like 2003 UB313 and Pluto
on the extended
tree of life, there is no space left in the Chinese system that is
clearly based on eight
objects whether from this system and as well as it might be, Nibiru.
Pluto will remain a puzzle as most astronomic phenomena since it does
not bend to the
"laws of astrology" or any superstition for that matter. Pluto decided
abdication after its
transit in Serpens Cauda, an IAU constellation that happens to be the
eastern ascendant of
the U.S.A. The ever-helpful Pluto NASA ephemeris shows Pluto mainly
occupied in
Ophiuchus in the past years with generous sojourns into Serpens Cauda.
Other ephemeris
such as very revealing NASA Sun and Moon ephemeris, exposing Sun in
Ophiuchus or
Moon in Auriga; Venus ephemeris showing Venus in Orion or Hydra, or
current
ephemeris for the Jupiter's sojourn in Ophiuchus are downloadable from
the site.
Our recommended publications include the 2003 UB313 series along with
special early
publication on 2003 EL61 and 2005 FY9. Delineation in the 12 houses is
given for
Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, Ixion, Varuna and 2002 AW197. The collection of
early
delineation is entitled Transneptunian Astrology.
In our 108 Points in Astrology we mentioned the problem arising when
astrologers
assume Pluto is capable of making a 180 degrees opposition with Mars
when in fact this
is not true due to its inclination. Pluto will remain a mystery to
astrologers for that and
many other reasons. Finally if they never knew where the dwarf planet
really stood in
their natal charts, much as our astronomy forefathers hardly knew their
own natal Sun
position, one can rightfully say that nothing is lost and all ends up
well for the dwarfs..

The Future

What is the future and can we change it for good? Our intimate future
can stand out
emancipated from default future in that we can change it for our
purposes. Since with the
reality rendering tools suite we can change our future in minutes we
immediately ask,
"What is good for us?"

The Devil
We base our definition of the devil on the works of Carlos Castaneda.
The personal devil
is an inorganic being feeding on man much as man feeds on animals only
that the pest is
invisible to human beings. The victims are not aware of the problem
since they were told
not to since early childhood. A child is not supposed to be afraid of
strange flying shades
in his nursery much as an adult is not supposed to ask that kind of
question. By asking the
right kind of question one gets the right answer. There is a set of
questions that one is
supposed to ask along with default answers that make part of default
mind. Man is
created by default in the face of the devil. The personal devil
installs one's own mind for
greed and passion to generate emotion. The devil feeds on emanations
from the victim
from shopping malls to harlot paradise. There is a country born with
the tail of the serpent
rising in the east at birth that prospers in the area.

Personal Future
By "personal future" we mean the eternal future of one's own choice.
Whatever does not
fall into that category can be termed "default future". The word
"personal" might in fact
not be chosen very well since it stands for something alien that we use
as our "person".
The person or interface is shown in the first house of the horoscope
mainly 30 degrees
under the eastern horizon. What lies 30 degrees above the eastern
horizon is grace or the
region of the immortals. This 12th
house has been understood as the darkest of all because
it is the house of the rising sun. The discrepancy is typical to false
ego that twists
meaning that can easily pass as dogma. In fact the whole of the
astrological community.gladly accepts that the darkest house of all is
in the east. It is only "logical" that the east
is dark since the sun did not rise and perhaps never will. Such
apparently logical passages
never undergo examination and if there is a complaint or theory it is
either discarded or
swept under the carpet. As concerns astrology lodges NASA is well under
the target with
God and reason apart from common sense and one's own eyes as well. One
is told not to
observe the vault, not to see the rising sun, ignore moonrise and
forget reason in order to
believe in superstition as managed by the enemy of man that goes under
the name of
astrology. The devil has succeeded to convince reasonable people that
their natal sun is in
"Scorpio" where it is clearly in Virgo. The devil has ridiculed the
American people by
turning their heads from NASA and towards superstition. An immense host
of illiterate
people that pass under the name of astrologers provides personality
conflict of global
scale by telling the client his wrong natal data. It would be tedious
to enumerate the web
sites and authors divulging misinformation. Kepler, Newton and
Nostradamus could not
do anything else but join in since corruption flowered already at the
time of the Greeks.
In Praise of the Evil One?
In mock "praise of the devil" we may say we are impressed by all
pervading disinterest in
truth as concerns one's self. The praise goes to the strategic measures
taken. The devil
installs a would-be personal mind that is in fact its own. The original
mind peters out by
the average age of three. The process of taking that original mind from
the human baby is
in great acceleration since we (the devil and us) provide the newborn
with computer
gadgets. We can't wait to have a tabula rasa to operate upon.
Default Mind Uninstaller
We uninstall false ego by wiping out opposites. Opposites form the
binary mind. The
binary mind or yin yang mind is not our own at all however fantastic or
implausible it
might sound to the newcomer.
So how do we transpire to true mind? All we need is an opportunity to
start over without
prejudice, a clear slate. According to John Locke tabula rasa is a
young mind not yet
affected by experience.
The description of the process from True Mind Distiller includes sample
pairs of
opposites to discreate before the original clear slate appears. One can
either program
one's clear slate or enjoy it. A cornucopia can probably deliver a wish
that is not good for
us and as such not our own.
In our naive way we described it as follow. The advice to the initiate
was to express a
wish instantly after discreation so that no random vibration enters his
sphere. The
wording went something like this. After clearing one's mind from doubts
one expresses a
wish. A vacuum such as a pure untroubled mind is nevertheless open to
random
suggestions from the open universe. Thus it is dangerous to let any
random vibration
enter the initiate's mental sphere after discreation..The methods we
used to produce results were based on clearing technology. One
replicates the negativity in one's own mind, the better to puff it up
and discreate. A
temporal mind void is then filled with positive intent.
We of course discovered that there is nothing better than a holy mantra
to fill the void.
Since the mantra is professed as perfect it was our best asset in
fighting chaos. The
technique that kept its working name of "Oberon 5" thus returned to its
eastern origins.
But our mission was not complete yet.
The average initiate will alas be driven by the devil into false
reprogramming of one's
clear slate and back into the arms of the daddy. Thus Deprogramation
can fail. This is one
of the reasons for the true guru. At this epoch it is difficult to find
one with the
proliferation of gurus and avatars
The pairs of opposite can be discreated with O5. Discreate this,
discreate that and what is
left is pretty close to true mind. No mama, no papa; no time, no space;
neither this nor
that and there you are!
We uninstall false ego by wiping out opposites. We chose a set of
typical opposites that
form the top of the list. This is done by the O5 master. The typical
pairs are the sun and
the moon, father and mother, penis and vulva, yang and yin, god and
devil and so on.
The Man in the Street
If the initiate has obscure "binary mind" problems what of the man in
the street? An O5
initiate is perfectly capable of materializing anything and that within
minutes when Snow
Crash initiation takes over. What about the simple fellow in the
street? He is of course
easily manipulated but if the exceptional fellow is a simple one
perhaps he has even more
chances than the initiate himself does.

Superstition in the Age of Aquarius
Copyright (c) 2006 by Klaudio Zic, all rights reserved.
http://www.lulu.com/astrology
A Shameful Past
Astrology became obscure since the arrival of the primitive Greek
tribes in Egypt and the
fall of Mayan civilization. Humanity suffered enchained in dark
ignorance ever since.
Common astrological programs produce errors ranging from 40 to
fantastic 270 degrees,
apart from total misconception and general superstition known as
western astrology.
It is amazing that in a country known by its astronomical feats one
can't find any trace of
astrology proper. The blame is of course not on us since error and
misconception are due
to lack of initiation resulting in superstition. Astrological program
makers occasionally
do know the right position of the planets but are of course quite
unable to compete with
astronomy. Astronomy is thus robbed of data and mission for the sake of
superstition.
Superstition in Western Astrology
Superstition says that everybody born on spring equinox has natal Sun
in Aries. While
that could be true in other epochs it can not possibly hold water at
this one since
precession as we measure it has moved from Aries to the constellation
of Pisces.
One is welcome to study astronomy as well as observation before any
attempt to
predictive calculus. Astrologers like Kepler, Newton or Nostradamus
were not able to
calculate their own natal position of the Sun. We have to wait only 650
years full of hope
towards an informed planet and initiated children of man.
Astrologers apparently believe in a fixed vault with the earth rotating
around its axis. This
rotation is complex as giving rise to long-term phenomena such as one
known as
precession. It is due to precession that George cannot possibly have
Aries ascending in its
horoscope. At the time when Aries rose in one's horoscope there the
name George was
not invented yet. There was much diversity at the heroic time when King
Arthur's Aries
was rising and the Grail of Crater, too. The Lamb was young but already
coping with at
least twice as much ascendant than e.g. present epoch Cetus'
competition. Different sorts
of people were born under different skies. Nobody would support a
pharaoh who had
Lepus ascending since Orion or Osiris stood well above this soothing
little constellation..The Last Unicorn
An ascendant is the star and constellation rising in the east. This
definition differs from
the astrologic one by 0 - 360 degrees. The amount of error as made by
what goes under
recent astrology is thus unlimited. There are of course 88 ascendants
as defined by our
IAU standards but only 16 for the present epoch. This results in
uniformity rather than
diversity. In other epochs diversity ruled as Draco was rising or Lepus
descending. In our
article about the royal family we stated that members of the family
have Unicorn setting
in their horoscopes meaning the end of the royal line. The Unicorn is
of course
Monoceros. Hydra (Masonry) and Sextans (Vatican) separate the Lion and
Unicorn in the
sky with neighboring Canis Minor (U.S.A.). Vatican has Sextans
ascending, American
president George Bush has Canis Minor ascending and Hydra rose at Cairo
when the
Book of Law was written. The detail with Egyptian purport is available
although the site
www.lulu.com/astrology with frequent references to Procyon, Sirius and
Venus in Orion
as well as the apocalyptic entry of Venus in Hydra as scheduled for
next year.
Where are the Planets?
So where are the planets? The planets are obviously not where recent
astrology puts
them. Pluto is entering Ophiuchus on its exit from the American
ascendant constellation
of Serpens Cauda and on its way towards the negative stargate in
Sagittarius. Jupiter
enters Ophiuchus. Venus was recently in Orion. The Moon is in Auriga
and so on. We
truest that no "astrologer" understood a word of this because this is
astrology.
Something that is unable to calculate the position of the planets is
called superstition. As
everybody knows superstition comes from the devil. Carlos Castaneda and
his two-mind
concept best explain this.
One can not believe in God and NASA while embracing superstition at the
same time.
The transcendental conflict between the devil (false ego) and true mind
must be cured
with scientific truth. No astrologer could stand even a minor test, of
course. The matter
will give rise to scandal when exposed but since it is the devil that
is actually in command
on this planet of man, people would rather keep to superstition.
Scientific truth is for the
scientist, superstition for the people, but even a scientist is
sometimes baffled into
thinking he's a "Scorpio" when his natal Sun is clearly in Virgo and
there are of course
plenty examples of even more fantastic cheat. The matter could be
exposed at any IAU
conference as part of the program. Astrologers don't accept scientific
truth "by
definition" and it would be impossible much as it was in the past 2000
years to accept
heavens or even observe the sky.

Copyright (c) 2006 by Klaudio Zic, all rights reserved.
http://www.lulu.com/astrology
Bill Gates has everything to do with the dwarf planets (once again!)
since his natal Moon
is conjunct the largest dwarf planet known as 2003 UB313.
A year ago we published an experimental table of lucky days as based on
the Bill Gates
horoscope and our own estimation as well. The aspect between Moon in
Pisces and
largest dwarf planet 2003 UB313 in Cetus was judged fortunate.
Note that albeit the Moon is often in Cetus as well, it does not make
an aspect from Cetus
but from subsequent Pisces constellation, at least as concern our
ecliptic-based concept
of general astrology. Alternatively we tend to measure aspects by
azimuth and altitude.
The following scans are an upgrade to the "lucky days" as published in
the year 2005.
The idea was to use some of Bill Gates luck consisting mainly on minute
channeling of
the Moon 2003 UB313 energies. These combined energies are Bill Gates
forte.
Timing is traditionally given for Seattle. Note that the topocentric
Moon position was
virtually measured for Seattle. The reader will find the data on the
left bottom corner of
every scan and make correction for his own time zone.
How to apply the data? One must correct for time zone first.
Experienced astrologers may
want to correct the calculus for the local or topocentric Moon. Timing
is used much as
with lottery when Venus Jupiter and Uranus plot for excellent timing
for the winners.
The lucky days are thus made of very lucky minutes if your timing is
perfect. Try and be
exact to the minute in using your extra luck as combined with Jupiter
Uranus transits,
directions or progressions.
Good Luck!

www.lulu.com/astrology changed your future!
Copyright (c) 2006 by Klaudio Zic, all rights reserved.
http://www.lulu.com/astrology
Magick was a science confined to secretive lodges or untraceable
shamans. Now with the
real time reality rendering tools it is downloadable now! Nothing has
prepared you for
the O5 SnowCrash mind technology where the initiate materializes
anything in minutes!
So what is the deal with this site? What is that you really get here
and why is it so
different from anything you've ever seen on Internet? We changed your
future now!
The original material contains proven mind technology
enabling virtually everyone into doing just anything!
One is not only welcome to take a peak into one's own future but also
to focus on detail
within the full life panorama while choosing which personal futurity to
change right now.
We were not satisfied with future scanning even when we produced such
masterpieces as
I Ching matrix scanning method for astrologers at the end of our
zodiacal reformation.
We gave you the ultimate in personal future scanning astrology, a
system that blends
ultimate NASA technology with ancient initiation. It has really been
never done before.
Our experience led us into the exploration of the ancient systems of
future scanning while
we were already experienced in using modern NASA technology with the
new
discoveries. Our work spawned such groundbreaking stuff as the
M Precessed ascendant system,
M Astronomic zodiac and the
M X-zodiac for the 10
th
planet..No astrologic system was ever close to it!
Examples in scientific astrology as follow.
M The American President George Bush has Canis Minor rising in his
horoscope.
M The U.S.A. has Serpens Cauda ascending at east in Philadelphia.
M Usama bin Liden has Moon in Orion in his natal chart.
M The WTC had Moon in Orion on September 11
th
2001.
M The 10th planet was setting exactly with the WTC impact.
M Keanu Reeves has Mercury in Sextans.
M Princess Diana of Wales has Mercury in Orion.
M The last pope left us with Venus in Cetus.
M The London bombing happened with Mars in Cetus in the year 2005.
M Venus is in Orion with the Israeli attack in summer 2006.
M Venus is in Hydra in summer 2007.
M Jupiter and Pluto are in Ophiuchus in winter 2006.
M Your own child could have:
" Ascendant Cetus (Cetus is the sea-monster or whale)
" Moon in Cetus
" Mercury in Sextans (like Keanu Reeves!)
" Venus in Orion (like Princess Diana)
" Juno in Scutum or
" Pluto in Serpens Cauda (U.S.A. ascendant)
If born in august 2004.
You could have many planetary positions in your horoscope that are
completely obscure
to western as well as eastern astrologers from Vedic initiates to
Nostradamus.
Think of it before consulting just any astrologic web site!.Although we
have completed the zodiacal reformation we never stood still. We gave
you
reality-rendering tools that gave you the control over your own destiny
and here they are!
_ O5 stands for Oberon 5 and is the core initiation of all.
_ Snow Crash stands for result obtained in minutes.
_ Cascade lets you cut your way through the daily matrix of events.
_ True Mind Distiller lets you explore your true mind.
_ The Personal Cosmic Secretary is the ultimate tool giving absolutely
the best
performance in just any magickal as well as daily life situation. Its
main feature is to
optimize the download of event from the astral domain. Moses would love
it!
_ O5 Master gives you an idea on how to initiate close friends as well
as cure people.
The site offers groundbreaking stuff in self-exploration as well as
astrology for the future.
And future is where you are with us now!
