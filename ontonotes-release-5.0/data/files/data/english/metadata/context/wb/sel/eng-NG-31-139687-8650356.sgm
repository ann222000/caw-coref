From the USCF Issues Forum this morning:

&quot;Andy, both Susan and I were very active here at one point until some people
decided to drop in. She was trying to help because she truly believes in
interacting with chess players of all levels. She has done this long before
this forum. All she requested is for people to be respectful and civil.
Thanks to a few, there goes that. She only asked to have her handle removed
after receiving multiple legal threats. Her attorneys advised her to do so
and I cannot disagree with them. She still posts on about a dozen chess
forums and blogs.

As for me, I tried to hang on to this place as long as I could. I was hoping
and praying that after the election, some people would grow up and put the
best interest of the USCF first. I was wrong. Therefore, this will be my
last post on the USCF forum until proper moderation is taking place and the
AUG is revised and fully respected. It is also unacceptable for anyone to
abuse the moderators and FOC members.

Thank you (and Tim, Rodney, Polly, Louis and DrCheck too) for helping the
USCF out. Also special thanks to Terry V. and Wayne P. I wish everyone the
best.

Best regards,
PT

Now let's see how long before this post will be torn apart by the
musketeers.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

&quot;Both you and Susan did indeed post here frequently until several of us
musketeers began asking the hard questions you essentially refused and
continue to refuse to answer. For example, several posters here and on your
chessdiscussions forum are still waiting for the details regarding your
assertion that you made a proposal to increase traffic to the USCF forums
that was rejected.

Mr. Truong, IMHO, you puff a great deal as many people in marketing do. That
in itself is not the problem. The problem for all of us is that you are now
on the EB and it's time to produce the bacon. So far, you've failed
miserably. 90% talk and posturing--little substance. So run away and try to
hide from accountability over at your forum. Pulling posts over there will
keep you a bit more insulated. But already, pulled posts from your forum are
popping up in other places. It would be so much easier to be open and
transparent. Give it a try sometime. We'd all benefit.

Best regards,
BL&quot;
