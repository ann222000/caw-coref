Comments from its users:

Triphala, as it is called, is the most popular Ayurvedic herbal formula of India, since it is an effective laxative which also supports the body's strength.Because of its high nutritional value, Triphala uniquely cleanses and detoxifies at the deepest organic levels without depleting the body's reserves. This makes it one of the most valuable herbal preparations in the world. Triphala combines both nutritional as well as blood and liver cleansing actions. It has little function as a demulcent or lubricating laxative, however. It possesses some anthroquinones which help stimulate bile flow and peristalsis. The nutritional aspect is more in the form of its high vitamin C content, the presence of linoleic oil and other important nutrients which it makes more of a tonic. Triphala is a completely balanced energetic formula, being neither too cold, nor too hot. When taken regularly over a long period, it gently effects the elimination and purification of Ama from the tissues of the entire body. The three fruits have been scientifically studied and confirm some of its known traditional benefits. These include the lowering of cholesterol, reducing high blood pressure, benefiting circulation, improving digestion and regulating elimination without causing any laxative dependency.
There are two ways to take Triphala, as a powder or tablet. Traditionally Triphala is taken as a churna or powder. One would stir in two or three grams of the powder with warm water and consume the entire amount each evening or divided into three doses throughout the day. Since for most it does not possess a flavor that one would look forward to experiencing, it is convenient that Triphala is available in tablet or capsule form. Generally the dose is from two tablets 1-3 times daily or four to six tablets one time daily. Children may only require one or two tablets in the evening.

Triphala means a composition of three fruits. It is a traditional Ayurvedic (science of life) rejuvenation formula that promotes deep cleansing of Gastro-Intestinal tract and supports functions of digestive, circulatory, respiratory and genito-urinary systems. At the same time, Triphala is safe to take year round for eliminating all excesses while imparting strength to the entire gastrointestinal tract. It is the safest and best mild purgative to take on a regular basis. It is used to detoxify metals. Triphala, formulated by Ayurvedic physicians thousands of years ago and used by literally billions of people since, is considered the most effective and safest produkt for detoxification. Triphala is mild, non-habit forming, and a rejuvenative. Triphala (Trifala) is so effective because its three herbs are potent healers Amalaki, Emblica Officinalis, one of Ayurveda's greatest rejuvenators and a strong natural anti-oxidant, also helps to boost the immune system. Triphala is the one formula recommended for everybody. Triphala is gentle for people of all ages, from children to seniors. Presently Triphala is distributed and available in the US from a few different sources. The powder can be purchased online at :

No wonder, people with eczema and skin problems recover nicely when they start colon cleansing using triphala.

Triphala is a wonderful medicine. Actually it uses for colon cleansing and thus it gives comfort in many diseases. Like eye diseases, eczema etc.

But for a child I think it is better get advise from an ayurveda doctor.Since usually some people have diarrhea if the intake of triphala is increased. So for a child we cannot tell what amount to be given.

For an adult it is not a problem if he take a little daily by mixed with hot water before going to bed.

Food that is in our colon is used to replenish the "precious" parts of our bodies such as our hair, fingernails, toenails, etc. These parts are not essential organs, but if our colon is clogged with refined flour, mucoid plaque, and toxins, these parts will not get all its necessary nutrients to rebuild.

When our colon is toxic, we have gas, which can cause shooting pains, and spasms. Our bowels become dry, leading to constipation, and this effect can be seen in our brittle, weak fingernails, dry skin, and hair, and weak joints. No wonder, people with eczema and skin problems recover nicely when they start colon cleansing.
