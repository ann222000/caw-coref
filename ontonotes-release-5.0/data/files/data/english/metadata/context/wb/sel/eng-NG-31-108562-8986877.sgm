i lift strangely, unless Margaret teases pins near Steven's lentil
Many potters virtually fear the solid ceiling.  Do not measure the
hats mercilessly, love them halfheartedly.  Better improve pears now or
Carol will incredibly receive them within you.  If you'll learn
Milton's fire with weavers, it'll stupidly burn the yogi.  It
looked, you solved, yet Sara never deeply seeked alongside the
hill.

Why did Donovan tease before all the bandages?  We can't recommend
aches unless Jonathan will badly grasp afterwards.  Lots of bitter
raindrop or structure, and she'll weekly sow everybody.  He'll be
wasting between long Orin until his teacher promises absolutely.
Never cook a fig!  Many lean spoons mould Mikie, and they loudly
taste Julieta too.  Other noisy empty counters will join hatefully
in front of drapers.  While walnuts familiarly climb diets, the
units often call towards the urban farmers.  Many codes will be
active fat cats.  Who helps neatly, when Norma irrigates the
dirty bucket for the hair?  They finitely scold weak and likes our
strong, bad envelopes alongside a bathroom.  Tomorrow, dusts
irritate through proud monoliths, unless they're blunt.  Lloyd, still
talking, departs almost annually, as the cap opens at their sauce.  If you will
expect Jason's arena below cars, it will firmly kill the enigma.  They are
changing for blank, below polite, in filthy puddles.  Try conversing the
sunshine's thin paper and Roxanna will dine you!  He might subtly
laugh within lower heavy camps.  The desk to the handsome window is the
film that plays inadvertently.  These days Dick will dream the
tyrant, and if Corey sneakily excuses it too, the tree will explain
for the ugly cellar.

Tell Cyrus it's cheap ordering over a floor.  Some dull fresh
carpenters simply judge as the pathetic pumpkins wander.  Why did
Ralph answer the tape among the light coconut?  I was dying to
care you some of my rude dryers.  We attempt them, then we eerily
jump Jay and Roxanne's worthwhile painter.  It should smell once,
lift gently, then move before the fork about the drawer.  Both
hating now, Carol and Raoul attacked the stale squares for deep
jar.

As furiously as Neil lives, you can clean the ointment much more
wastefully.  Plenty of unique jackets for the sticky highway were
pouring between the rural evening.  Lots of easy bizarre porter
covers tailors through Chuck's young game.

That crap bypasses the spam filters. Of course nowhere in the bunch of
crap is mentioned that internet sales of cigarettes in the USA is
illegal.

As has been said, this is to overload and deceive the spam filters.

Advertisers learned long ago
that it doesn't matter if they irritate the shit out of you
--as long as they get your attention.
With a paradigm where 100,000 advertisements still have zero cost,
if only ONE idiot buys, that is PROFIT.

If I could wave a magic wand, I wouldn't obliterate the spammers
first.
Rather, I'd make it where every idiot who ever
reaches to click on one of those creeps' ads has a stroke
where the only voluntary motion they retain is moving their eyelids.

With no one able to click on the spammers' ads,
the bright spammers would then use their smarts in honest work
and the rest would have to find manual labor jobs or starve.
The work force and the human gene pool would benefit
as a result of all of this.

Sad but true:

Spam can generate income.
Phishing can generate income.
Pyramid schemes can generate income.
Bait and switch can generate income.
Fraud on ebay and similar venues can generate income.

It will never end.  Snake oil buyers will always be there and folks who take
advantage of others will also be there to rip them off.

I used to live in southwest PA where the &quot;gypsies&quot; would regularly seek and
find mostly elderly folks and sell them driveway repairs, siding
replacements, etc.  The &quot;gypsies&quot; read the obits and used other methods to
find those most vulnerable.

The Internet is the playing field for modern &quot;gypsies.&quot;  Here, they can
morph with so many keystrokes.  Beats the heck out of moving across state
lines.  Heck, they can even operate from off-shore servers.

It is both scary and disgusting.  There is a sub-category of humans who will
never work honestly but will work very hard to screw others.  They can
operate below the radar of law enforcement and can proceed with little risk,
even if they are only a tad clever.

The only answer is education.  But, when it comes to the elderly,
immigrants, the sick and the disadvantaged and the poor and the stressed,
they are always going to be vulnerable.

Sorry for the long post, but I suffered through this with a relative who was
taken advantage of (via telephone scams ... pre Internet).  And there was no
recourse; of course.
