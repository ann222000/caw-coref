Selection tips:
Look for firm, bright green stalks with tight, compact heads. Avoid
spears that are dry, limp, or wrinkled, or have ruffled tips. Thinner
spears are usually more tender, and you'll want to choose similarly
sized ones so they'll cook evenly. One pound equals 16 to 20 spears, or
about two cups chopped.

Storage tips:
Try not to buy asparagus too long before you intend to cook it. When
you get it home, don't wash it; instead, either stand the stalks
upright in about an inch of water and cover them (and the container)
with a plastic bag, or wrap the stem ends in a wet paper towel and seal
the asparagus in a plastic bag. Either way, it will keep for only about
three days.
