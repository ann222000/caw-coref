Hello All,
The recent race rig theft from the Baja 1,000 of the family at  gunpoint,
last week who had been traveling safely for 20 years, brought  back bad memories
for me, those folks lost $70K in gear, and the family was  terrorized at
gunpoint and dropped on a mountain far away from help. Me and an  ex boyfriend went
down to Quatro Casas to surf on vacation, the week after we  went friends of
ours went on our referral, their girlfriend was raped, the  boyfriend shot in
the leg for trying to protect her.  The week prior to  that at Rosarita beach
a friend of ours who is a paramedic was attacked while  towel changing near
his truck after surfing..they cut his face with a broken  beer bottle, which
required surgery.

We lost a truck to thieves while working on the movie set for the  Titanic
years ago, stolen in a guarded lot...I have not had good experiences in  Baja
travel, so I'm pretty nervous myself traveling there. I get sick and tired  of
the bribes I pay and the 'guns and drugs' request, which is so bogus.

There are certainly problems in America, but at least I know my  insurance
policy, have law enforcement I can request help from and medical  facilities
that will care for me or mine.  I do love the continent and it's  people but
desperate times create desperate conditions and of course Americans  will be
targeted for having more.  And yes I will be traveling to Mexico  next month to
train towsurfers on the mainland in a beautiful place far away  from where I am
typing this..., so no I'm not boycotting, but am I concerned?  Yes I am.

Anyhow this subject is increasingly getting more  attention.

Be careful if you travel south of the border. Shawn

U.S. renews warnings to Baja travelers

By: ADAM KAYE - Staff Writer
Encinitas man reports robbery,  assault
Driving into Baja California may be losing its appeal for some North County
travelers, as U.S. government advisories, Internet chatter and hand-wringing
around local surf shops warn of increased trouble for American motorists in
northern Mexico.

Late last month, the U.S. Department of State warned the  public about
narcotics-related violence in Baja California and other Mexican  states.
On Wednesday, an official from the U.S. consulate's office in Tijuana said
that within the last four months American travelers have reported four separate
incidents of armed robberies and assault. Two of the reports were lodged by
surfers.
Many crimes victimizing Americans are not reported to the consulate, however,
as tourists hurry up to the border to put bad experiences behind them,
consular  spokesman Charles Smith said.

Thus, &quot;official&quot; figures may be a fraction  of the whole problem.

Reports of violence
In one case reported  to the consulate, an Encinitas surfer said he was
attacked with his girlfriend  during a camping trip Oct. 23.

Pat Weber said he is a veteran Baja  traveler but will never return to the
peninsula after he and his girlfriend were  held at gunpoint during a robbery on
a remote coastal bluff. His girlfriend was  assaulted during the ordeal,
Weber said.

A spokesman with the attorney  general's office in Baja California said last
week that no arrests had been made  and that authorities were continuing to
investigate Weber's  case.

Meanwhile, Weber's story has spread on travel Web sites, the online  edition
of Surfer magazine and through a news segment on CNN.

In the  latest incident of reported violence, an El Cajon family was robbed
at gunpoint  last week just outside Tijuana as they drove home from an off-road
race in Cabo  San Lucas.

Chris Hall, a member of racer Andy McMillin's crew, was  driving his family
home when two cars of armed robbers forced them to pull over  and stole their
truck and other belongings, said Matt Martelli, a spokesman for  McMillin.

Attempts to reach Hall were unsuccessful  Friday.

Martelli said he didn't know all of the details of the robbery,  but added
that Hall is &quot;pretty shaken up about it and not really talking to  anyone.&quot;

Mexican officials say incidents are few
Although some  surfers say their days of camping at the beaches of Baja are
over, an official  with the Mexican government said Wednesday that recently
reported crimes against  Americans are isolated incidents.

Edgar Lopez, a spokesman for Baja  California's secretary of public safety,
said coordinated efforts among local,  state and federal law enforcement
officers provide vigilance throughout the  entire state.

&quot;The surfer,&quot; Lopez said, referring to Weber, &quot;it's not  very frequent that
we have these crimes on foreigners. The problem is not  growing.&quot;

'Armed guys with ski masks'
The consulate's office  in Tijuana isn't so sure. U.S. officials are
investigating whether  paramilitary-styled bandits are specifically targeting
Americans in Baja  California, Smith said.

In addition to Weber's case, the consulate  received reports recently that
two American surfers were pulled over near the  border by an automobile with
flashing lights that was masquerading as a police  car.

&quot;Next thing they knew there were these armed guys with ski masks  pulling
them out of their cars and robbing them of everything,&quot; Smith said.  &quot;We're still
establishing whether or not this is a trend.&quot;

Regardless,  Weber said the bandits took $10,000 worth of cash and electronic
equipment.

Weber, owner of the Encinitas-based San Diego Surfing Academy,  said he has
surfed in Mexico for years and has dealt with petty crimes and  traffic cops
demanding bribes.

&quot;I've had all those normal experiences and  I still return time and time
again,&quot; Weber said. &quot;But I draw the line at armed  robbery and sexual assault.&quot;

Harassing U.S. citizens
As one of  his final acts in Mexico, Weber said, he reported the crime to
authorities.

Smith, of the consulate's office, said last month's  announcement renewed one
that the U.S. ambassador to Mexico first issued nine  months ago. The latest
announcement is scheduled to expire April 15.

The  announcement reports dozens of cases of U.S. citizens being kidnapped in
Mexico  in recent years.

&quot;No one can be considered immune from kidnapping on the  basis of occupation,
nationality, or other factors,&quot; the announcement states.  &quot;Criminals have
been known to follow and harass U.S. citizens traveling in their  vehicles,
particularly in border areas including ... Tijuana.&quot;

U.S.  citizens should restrict their stays to well-known tourist destinations
and  travel only by day on main roads, the announcement states, and &quot;should
exercise  caution when in unfamiliar areas and be aware of their surroundings
at all  times.&quot;

At least one tour operator in Baja California said reports of  crimes on the
peninsula are overblown.

&quot;It really upsets me,&quot; said Carol  Kramer of Discover Baja.

San Diego has crime, too
She said  newspapers are chock-full of crime stories in San Diego, but that
tourism to  that city continues nonetheless.

&quot;We're hearing people who are worried,&quot;  Kramer said. &quot;What we're telling
them is you never drive at night, take normal  precautions, caravan and don't
camp alone.&quot;

On the Internet, unverified  reports by surfers of armed robberies in Baja
California have popped up on  surfing and travel Web sites.

&quot;The general feeling is yeah, at least  since Labor Day, it's gone beyond the
(Tijuana) cop shakedown for $40,&quot; said  Scott Bass, online editor at large
for Surfer Magazine. &quot;These guys are firing  guns and sexually assaulting girls.&quot;

Dozens of comments are attached to a  story by Bass about Weber's ordeal. A
number of them describe robberies and  other crimes of which bloggers say they
were victims.

The chatter at some  area surf shops is that surfers who would have camped in
Mexico now are  exploring other options.

&quot;People are definitely rethinking their plans,&quot;  said Witt Rowlett, owner of
Carlsbad Pipelines. &quot;There's very definitely been a  negative connotation
about driving down to Baja to surf.&quot;

At Encinitas  Surfboards, manager Doug Jopes said he has heard similar
concerns.

&quot;We  don't run tours out of here,&quot; Jopes said, &quot;but at the moment I wouldn't
encourage anyone to be driving in Baja at night whatsoever.&quot;

together to Puerto Nuevo for  over 25 years. We have also traveled all over the

discussed the current  events in tourism. We discussed how Americans coming to
Mexico drink tequila and  act in manners they would never act at home. But
even they are upset about these  recent happenings. Broad daylight crimes. Men
in masks? Robbers dressed like  cops! Attacking surfers! Mr. Weber is
definitely someone who knows how to travel  safely through Mexico. I understand why he
would not want to return. I have  trust in most of the people in Mexico. We
have found most destinations to be 99%  full of wonderful people and there is
always someone who wants to destroy our  faith in human nature. While I would
like to say I would never go to Mexico  again. I will. Just like I will never
let the terrorists keep me off an  airplane. But I will not be taking the same
precautions. I will add even more.  Gone are the days I will head their alone
like I used to do. I will stay at a  reputable hotel ... Stay in the hotel
after dark and walk to PN for Lobster and  take a taxi if you must go dancing
somewhere. Stay on the toll roads and don't  stop for any police cars until you
get to a toll booth. They are aware of why  you will not stop. The owners of
this hotel care about your safety. And the  tourism industry down there is very
concerned as they love their work and they  care about your safety. Heck they
care about their own. But when ever something  like this happens I try and put
it in perspective. How safe is it in San Diego,  LA, NYC, Washington DC if you
are in the wrong place at the wrong time? Everyday  bad things like this
happen all over the world. Crimes like this happen every  day in the States. It is
a sad statement of the times. Or is it. I grew up on  the east coast and
often heard and saw people who were connected to the Italian  and Irish mafias. So
- I am so sad to learn of these recent events. What surf  spots are these
crimes happening? I would like to know more since my husband  goes surfing each
time we are there! Next time the surf board might have to stay  home until this
stuff stops. What time of day did those kids get their car  stolen from
Puerto Nuevo? That one is incredible - there are police officers all  over town.

Sound familiar? One guy couldn't have  been more than 17, and they were pretending

Do you think these sorts of crimes could be  perpetrated here in the US? These
'pull-over' robberies where vehicles and  possessions are taken by banditos,
or rogue cops is nothing new and happens all  the time especially on lonely
stretches of highway in the northern states. This  brings up a deeper, more
comprehensive reason why we should be very cautious in  accepting immigrants from
Mexico. Why? Because of the social mores and  philosophical differences between
our two countries. Word to the wise: STAY OUT  OF MEXICO. There are plenty of
good, safe places to visit (and surf) here in the  US.

is that Mexico is nothing more than a  third world banana republic country.
The country is ruled by the mafias. Crime,  corruption, bribery and extortion
are ingrained into the DNA of the Mexican  government. The corruption of the
despicable Mexican government is what drives  the illegal immigration north into
the United States. The only policy that the  United States should have towards
Mexico right now is to hermetically seal the  Southern border and then begin
exporting arms to the people so that they can  overthrow their mafia
controlled narcodemocracy. Thomas Jefferson once said 'The  tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots  and tyrants.' This
remains as true today as it did 225 years ago and this is  just as applicable to the
people of Mexico today as it was to the American  colonists in the 1700s.
Think about it...this is the reality in  Mexico.

dehumanized. Must all be FOX  'news' viewers. Mexicans come here because American
employers need and want them  for their cheap labor; and drugs come because
there is a HUGE market. Fix the  problems here and away go the immigration and

over 10 years when one evening  a friend from the DC area was visiting and one
of the things on his list was  &quot;Get t-shirts from Hard Rock&quot;, and asked me
about getting there. So we take the  trolley, get off, walk across the bridge
and through the spinning gate of no  return... go straight to the Hard Rock,
which we spotted from the aerial view.  When it's time to leave- walking back I
hear someone calling my name, and I'm  like, &quot;huh?&quot;, must be a fluke, keep
going. The person is more insistent, and the  general knowledge of not wanting to
get in any trouble where cops are needed in  Mexico, is on my mind. They make
up 'laws' on the spot. I keep heading for a  more open area to confront the
issue and make it most of the way back to the  river crossing, when the
confrontation happens. It was settled with words in the  midst of many onlookers and
that was that, but the thought of jumping into the  back end of an open pickup
truck to get a few blocks away did cross my mind, but  I didn't want to just
ditch the guy that was with me and leave him to be the  slack taker, either. We
spent a couple hours in the McDonalds on the U.S. side  after clearing the
immigration. My absolute biggest fear, having ID stolen.  While the US border
station is actually well onto US soil, you're still screwed  until you get well
inside the building.

USA vs. Mexico... On Quince St. in  Escondido over 300 illegal immigrants swarm

Caramel Frappuccino and while you wait, you  can hire some illegals to mow your
lawn... The Minutemen came by and had a guy  arrested, but he was on the same

Illegal Immigrants are robbing us and raping us  right here in the USA.... It may
be safer to go to BAJA as crime rates in North  County are approaching record

about Del Mar, Encinitas, Carlsbad, or even NORTHERN  CALIFORNIA.
