Well,

Been about 600kms so far, and must say I am impressed with the car.
Performance is hugely improved, but fuel consumption is about the same
as it was. 18-20l per 100km.

I cannot say whether the chip had any effect, because of the fact that I
had branches, freeflow, new 260deg cam and head porting done at the same
time.

It's a different motor completely, very smooth and pulls nicely at all
revs, although she pulls nice and strong as the revs get to around 4000.

Anyway, suppose nothing for nothing and I must say I tend to drive her
rather hard.

Overall, very happy!

Cheers
Jacque

Good day everyone.

I have some rims that I want to sandblast. Any idea of places in Pta - west

Much appreciated!

Thsi cam will not make power below 3000 rpm. Useless for towing ....you

I dunno, but will not be towing with it anyway, it's my Sandton pavement
hopper.

It goes very nicely below 3000. Specially with the autobox. And it's
very lekker to put foooot and the revs jump over 3000, and something
actually happens besides just using more fuel :-)

Clever man! Yep, closish to the top just after you hit 110km/h I hit 720
degrees. And that is where I have my alarm set. The JCB diesel speed
record engine used Water Injection to keep the EGT down by the way. Did
something like 560km/h or something. At the Dyno a while ago their was a
Cupra Diesel that made 203kw at the wheels(EEEEEEKKK) also using Water
Injection to keep the EGT down. For comparison, the slightly fiddled
Range Rover Sport made 182 kw at the wheels on the same Dyno...

I don't have a roofrack on the disco. How about I put a case of beer in
the back instead? That way it does not matter who wins, the result will
be fun!

Can we drive for 50 kms at 140kph first? That way you will have to slow
down when your EGT gets too high when we hit Krugersdorp hill :) ha ha
ha ha...

Jacque - No egt kuk.....

I don't have a roofrack on the disco. How about I put a case of beer in
the back instead? That way it does not matter who wins, the result will
be fun!

Can we drive for 50 kms at 140kph first? That way you will have to slow
down when your EGT gets too high when we hit Krugersdorp hill :) ha ha

Don't get carried away.  That V8 does not want to be driven hard.  Firstly
it won't give you much and secondly it won't last.  That engine is a long
life engine provided that you change oil very regulary and you don't push
the revs.

If properly tuned and driven like an English gentleman it should give 6 - 7
km per liter out of town and 15% less in town.

Derik,

When I got some rims from Gys I had them sand blasted in KyaSands at a
place next door to Cross Country Landies for R150 for 3 rims. Sorry I dont
have a name or tel number for you but you can maybe phone Cross Country
Landies and ask.

What cam exactly and where did you get it.  My 4.6V8 now has at least one
gently tapping tappet and smokes a bit on the overrun so is in dire need of
at least new tappets but probably a cam, cam bearings, timing chain,
pushrods, rockers and a head overhaul as well.   320 000 km including an oil
pump failure in the middle of that so I can't really complain too much.  I
have started to price various options.

The easiest is to buy directly from RPI in the UK since they still have all
records from the original build and know exactly what was fitted.   However,
this is probably not the cheapest way to fix the issues.

thanks
JamesV

Well,

Been about 600kms so far, and must say I am impressed with the car.
Performance is hugely improved, but fuel consumption is about the same
as it was. 18-20l per 100km.

I cannot say whether the chip had any effect, because of the fact that I
had branches, freeflow, new 260deg cam and head porting done at the same
time.

It's a different motor completely, very smooth and pulls nicely at all
revs, although she pulls nice and strong as the revs get to around 4000.

Anyway, suppose nothing for nothing and I must say I tend to drive her
rather hard.

Overall, very happy!

Cheers
Jacque

If the howl of a V8 with cam and branches coming into song does not stir the
blood then check for a pulse.   V8 owners do not buy them to be
sensible...we are addicted   :-)    However, if I had the self control to
drive my V8 sensibly then your comments probably true.

Beg to differ, my old V8 had oil changes at 30 000 km intervals if I
remembered to get to it and is doing well with 300 000 on the clock. And
with a trailer behind you could run it foot flat without worries about egt
etc.

Slight tappet tick was audible when I sold it.

Not really. The length of driving seems to have minimal effect on it.
Guess it has to do with the efficiency of the intercooler. Wrong gear
selection does. For instance, if it is labouring in say 5th and you
should really be in 4th or third, the EGT goes through the roof, despite
having low revs.
Driving to Nam 800od km's non stop( I can coz I do not have to fill up
hehehehe) didn't see any temps above 550-600. Was below 500 more often
than not. This was doing 120km/h speedo speed (116 GPS) fully loaded

Not really. The length of driving seems to have minimal effect on it.
Guess it has to do with the efficiency of the intercooler. Wrong gear
selection does. For instance, if it is labouring in say 5th and you
should really be in 4th or third, the EGT goes through the roof, despite
having low revs.
Driving to Nam 800od km's non stop( I can coz I do not have to fill up
hehehehe) didn't see any temps above 550-600. Was below 500 more often
than not. This was doing 120km/h speedo speed (116 GPS) fully loaded

Can I assist by filming the event.
Will take a shot of the smoking exhausts and tyres from the rear, then go to
the top and film the finish - got a new camera on my bicycle.

Better yet, I have a Freelander to keep everybody in touch with their
