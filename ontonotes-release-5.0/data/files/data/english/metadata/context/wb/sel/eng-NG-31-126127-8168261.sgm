Riding the stormy sea of celebrity law
Lawyer-to-the-stars Debra Opri was a star in her own right on cable
TV. Now she needs the legal help.
By Rachel Abramowitz and Robert W. Welkos, Times Staff Writers
July 22, 2007

Up until last month, there didn't seem to be a TV camera that
attorney Debra Opri wouldn't embrace.

The brash, self-professed blue-collar gal from New Jersey had
secured a costarring role in the Anna Nicole Smith media circus as
the attorney waging war to prove that Larry Birkhead was in fact the
father of the now-deceased Playboy bombshell's baby girl.

Her hair long, dark and stick-straight, the 47-year-old hovered
perennially at Birkhead's side, always ready to hit the Larry
King-Bill O'Reilly talk-show circuit on his behalf, always filled
with snappy quotes for reporters. Before Smith died, Opri routinely
chastised the buxom blond from myriad courthouse steps. &quot;Where's
this woman's decency? Where's her fairness?&quot; a righteous Opri asked.

Now, her former star client is asking the same question about Opri.

In March the two acrimoniously parted ways, and in June, Birkhead
sued her for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and legal malpractice.
He also filed a complaint with the California Bar Assn., which is
investigating. Two weeks ago, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Charles C. Lee gave Birkhead his first victory in what is expected
to be a long skirmish — granting his request that $591,250 of
Birkhead's money Opri had sequestered in her attorney-client trust
account be transferred into a separate blocked account, that could
be touched only by court order.

While it's unclear how the case will end, Birkhead's allegations
have the potential to seriously dent Opri's once-promising career as
the next Greta Van Susteren or Nancy Grace, one of those
tough-talking, camera-ready legal eagles on call to opine about the
day's courthouse skirmish. To journalist and author Diane Dimond,
who first noticed Opri at the second Michael Jackson trial, Opri was
at the vanguard of a &quot;disturbing trend of attorneys that began to
show up at high-profile trials like Scott Peterson, Robert Blake and
Michael Jackson.&quot; Lawyers, Dimond explains, who essentially show up
for the cameras to &quot;get face time.&quot; With law and celebrity
increasingly intertwined in a tabloid and 24-hour-news-dominated
culture, the matter of Birkhead vs. Opri is more than just a nasty
spat. It's also a revealing excursion into a high-stakes world where
punditry and legal representation can collide and where six-figure
deals between newsmakers and the media are part of the game.

Opri got her start in this rarefied corner of the law by working for
the late singer James Brown and then the parents of Michael Jackson.
She made a splash giving interviews during Jackson's molestation
trial. Her career, her detractors say, is a vivid case study of how
lawyers can push their way into the media circus and sometimes
profit from their exertions.

Birkhead's claims raise questions of whether she ran roughshod over
her client's interest in a quest to rack up airtime and legal bills.
His suit isn't her only problem. Opri represented actress Pamela
Bach in her legal faceoff in court against her erstwhile husband,
&quot;Baywatch&quot; star David Hasselhoff. Last month, Bach fired Opri after
she lost full custody of her two daughters.

Meanwhile, Hasselhoff's lawyers have filed a motion in Superior
Court to get her financial records to determine the exact sum —
believed by his lawyers to be hundreds of thousands of dollars —
that Bach and/or Opri allegedly received in connection with the sale
to the media of the infamous video of a drunken Hasselhoff. Opri
denies having anything to do with the video.

She also adamantly disputes Birkhead's accusations and has brought
on Sitrick and Co., the crisis P.R. firm, to help her quell the
stirring controversy.

Sitting in the lush backyard of her Santa Monica home, the lawyer is
all coiled energy in slacks and a white jacket. &quot;This has been a
nightmare,&quot; said a teary-eyed Opri. &quot;It's not fair, it's not right.&quot;
She believes that Birkhead was behind the leaking of her legal bill
to him, which totaled $620,492, and included items such as a lobster
barbecue, thousand of dollars' worth of limo rides and $1,500 a
month for her publicist. According to her legal bill placed in the
court file, she routinely charged Birkhead about $119 per e-mail,
not to mention the over $96,000 she billed him for her time on
cellphone calls.

...

A graduate of New York University and Whittier Law School, Opri in
the recent interview described her practice as 25% family law, 10%
criminal law, and the rest civil litigation. Despite her recent
foray into high-stakes family law, she is not a certified family law
specialist or by her own admission a member of the insular world of
L.A.'s celebrity divorce bar. Cary Goldstein, a palimony specialist
himself, had Opri as a law clerk and said, &quot;In the right case, Debra
could do a great job for her client. I don't believe her forte is
family law.&quot;

While her first celebrity client might have been James Brown, whom
she successfully defended in a sexual harassment claim, Opri's real
entrée into the media limelight came via the Jacksons. Not Michael
Jackson but his parents, Joe and Katherine Jackson. When the King of
Pop went on trial for child molestation in 2005, charges of which he
was eventually acquitted, Opri said she was hired to let his parents
&quot;know what was going on in the courtroom, to explain the law to them.&quot;

How she met them is a matter of some conjecture.

The parents declined to be interviewed for this story, but Sitrick
arranged for a statement from Katherine Jackson, sent by someone who
purported to be her assistant. In it, Jackson stated that she met
Opri through James Brown and was &quot;extremely pleased&quot; with her services.

But by another account their introduction was far more colorful and
occurred in 2004 at the opening-night party for Katherine's, the
West Hollywood restaurant owned by Joe Jackson and named after his
wife. According to a person who attended the party, Opri was also
there, lingering for more than two hours with the paparazzi outside
the restaurant's VIP room, where the Jackson patriarch and other
celebrities such as boxer Mike Tyson had gathered. The source said:
&quot;A door opens and out walks Joe Jackson and the second that door
opened up, that woman literally leapt into the middle of the crowd,
thrust her hand into the air like a clenched-fist '60s black-power
salute and yelled, 'Joe Jackson! Joe Jackson! It's Debra Opri! I
represented the Godfather of Soul!' [Joe] looked completely stunned.
She then thrust her [business] card into his hand. Joe took the card.&quot;

Publicist Angel Howansky, who is close to the Jacksons, says she and
TV producer Daphne Barak took Opri to meet the Jackson parents after
she'd met Opri at a book signing for a book about Michael Jackson.
&quot;I saw [Opri] and I said, 'My God, you just have this confidence
that blares out. I would love to introduce you to the family.' &quot; A
source who works with Barak confirms this account. That day,
Howansky says she saw Joe Jackson sign a contract with Opri.

Opri initially declined to explain how she knew the Jacksons, but
when faced with the myriad accounts, she said she was initially
introduced to Joe Jackson at a Grammy party and met him twice more
at Katherine's.

Whatever the origins of their relationship, landing the Jackson
parents turned out to be a boon to Opri's career. Given that the
actual lawyers who tried and defended Michael Jackson were under a
judge's gag order, Opri had a field day giving interviews.

According to former Court TV reporter Dimond, Opri would arrive at
the courthouse in Santa Maria, Calif., driving a black Mercedes
coupe with the personalized license plate reading &quot;Opri&quot; and head
straight for the TV cameras. &quot;And she would say some of the most
outrageous things. She wasn't talking about the family. She would
start talking about the criminal facts of the case,&quot; said Dimond.
According to news accounts, Opri often gave the media pro-Jackson
play-by-play accounts of the trial from the courthouse steps and
made the TV rounds as a Jackson booster. She told Bill O'Reilly, she
was &quot;not in it for the publicity…. I've told you I believe Michael
Jackson is innocent and I believe he's a victim.&quot;

Sitting in her backyard, contemplating her recent imbroglios with
Birkhead and Hasselhoff, Opri still says she'd love to get a paying
gig as a legal analyst. &quot;I would like my time paid for. Every three
to four minutes of TV warrants two to three hours of preparation,
and that's two to three hours away from my clients. I go on TV only
when I have something to say.&quot;

Even under siege, Opri gives good sound bite. &quot;I happen to consider
that my reputation means everything to me, and the fact remains that
I have to deal with the realities that now confront me and I will.

&quot;I am a girl from a hardworking background who worked and paid bills
from the day I left home,&quot; she said with gusto. &quot;I am someone who
believes the little guy gets stepped on regularly. I believe
everybody needs a fair break, and I believe that the handful of
people who happen to be in the spotlight who hire me and will
continue to hire me, they need a fair break too.&quot;
