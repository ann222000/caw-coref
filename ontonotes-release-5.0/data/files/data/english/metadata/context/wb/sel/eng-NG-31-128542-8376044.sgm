Hello everyone,

Natalie Downe and myself are moving to Brighton together in a few
weeks time. We've both been lurking on the list for a while, but I
thought it would be a good idea to introduce ourselves properly.

Natalie is a client-side web developer ([X]HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Information Architecture, usability testing, project management) who
is starting out as a freelancer in a couple of weeks having worked for
an agency in Oxfordshire for the past two years. I'm a client- and
server-side web developer specialising in Python, Django, JavaScript
and the occasional bit of PHP. I also like talking about OpenID :)
We'll both be looking to take on freelance work.

We're both really looking forward to moving to Brighton and I'm sure
you'll see us soon at one of Brighton's many digital events.

Cheers,

Simon and Nat

Hi Simon + Nat,

Since I'm browsing late at night (as well), I thought I'd take the
opportunity to say:

Welcome to the sunny delights that is Brighton!

Good timing too - looks like you may have brought (or bringing) the
sun with you.

Nah, the current sunshine is just a fluke, but on the bright side,
moving to brighton at least gets you away from the flooding!

Simon -

I met both you and Natalie at BarcampLondon2 - I'm also in the &quot;on BNM
getting to know people in advance of moving to brighton&quot; camp.  I'd
say welcome to brighton, but I can't - but welcome to the list !

(speaking of which, have you seen the PHP/Symfony + .NET + Rails +
Django barcamp brighton jobsite presentation we've been talking about
doing ? would you be up for the Django chair - I couldn't imagine a
better guy to do it !)

Hi Simon/Natalie,

Just wanted to say welcome to our lovely city &amp; the list!

James

Hiya Simon and Nat,

Welcome in advance!  If you've been lurking for a while, then you'll
know that the list is good for 1) slagging lettings agents, 2)
flamewars with ex-members of 90s ambient techno bands and 3) sometimes
the occasional bit of tech chat :)

I think a BNM trip down to Gemini's must be practically imminent...

Hello Simon, we nearly met at Chinwag I think, I was
with Andy Budd and after we left he said you were just
a few feet away...

If you fancied presenting your involvement in forming
Django at one of our £5 App meetings:
http://fivepoundapp.com/
we'd love to have you speak :-)

I buy crates of beer, John bakes cake, 25 or so people
attend (at Danny's rather cool 13 Brunswick Sq.), we
talk shop, people Pitch new ideas then we head to the
pub.

Tom Hume's talk on Future Platforms in 2 weeks is
looking to be very well-attended (30 or so by the
looks of things), be glad to have you both along if
you fancy?

Ian.

I'd be happy to do this any time after 1st September, which is our move-in date.

Cheers,

Welcome to you both!

Really glad to hear you are turning to the sea side, the contributions
you both made to BarCampLondon2 were fantastic.

May I ask what made you decide to make the move?  I have a feeling
Oxfordshire will miss you.

Jon.

Hi Simon - grand, I'll take you up on that - it'll be
great to hear more about the founding of Django.

See you about at one of the events and we'll figure
something out,
