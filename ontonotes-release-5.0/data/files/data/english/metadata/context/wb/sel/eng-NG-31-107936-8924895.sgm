It's occurred to me that while there are quite a few regulars in here,
other than a few (Ed, Art) who are well known pilots, I do not know much
about anyone.    So I am proposing this thread where people can state
who you are and why are you here?

Me?  I am a professional chemist.  I work in the security business (ID
cards, passports, drivers license, currency, anti-counterfeiting.  I am
49 years old, two grown sons and a long term wife.  I've never served in
any military service but only because I am mostly deaf.  I almost snuck
into the Army Reserve back in 1976 but the recruiter was shot down by
his superior.  It was a shame in a way because the local unit was in
need of someone to learn chemical defense.

My hobbies are history, warships, military aircraft and fishing of course.

I am NOT a well-known pilot, but I am an active pilot (airplanes and
gliders) and I have actually legally accepted money for flying.  But that is not
how I make my living.  By day, I am in the telecommunications business.

I finished out my cold war Navy days in an aircraft carrier.  No, not THAT
kind of an aircraft carrier.  It was actually the wet kind that carried 16
unmanned vertical takeoff airframes.  Fortunately for us all, we never conducted
flight operations.  My job on the submarine involved the propulsion plant.

Hobbies include antique electronics, amateur radio, and (oh yes) flying.

Who. Software test engineer for a government contractor and aspiring author.
After 30 years in the USAF as a crew chief; T-33, T-38, F-5E, and flight
engineer; EC-130E (ABCCC) and KC-10.  Fifty (ohmygawd) years old with a
wife, also long-term, and two teenagers, one of each gender.  Everyone on my
team is ex-USAF aircrew or a military brat so it's almost like being in a
squadron but without the extra duties.  And writing and re-writing
performance reports and award packages. And I actually have a schedule. But
boy do I miss the flying. And the box lunches.

Why. You'd think I'd have something better to do, but after a hard day at
the test suite I find it amusing to read the various postings of rants,
questions, philosophies, ends-of-the-world, the Israelis are running the
country, the Air Force sucks, 9/11 conspiracy, USS Liberty conspiracy,
Jewish conspiracy, Bush/Cheney/Republican/RightWing/BigOil conspiracy, moon
landing conspiracy, all technology descended from the Nazis, Antarctica is a
diskport, we're going to bomb Iran tomorrow/next week/next month/someday, if
you weren't a _____ you don't know squat, U.S. and friendly nation laws
prohibit fully reproducing copyrighted material...

And oh yeah, military aviation.  I guess I'm addicted to it. If nothing else
I found out about &quot;When Thunder Rolled&quot;.

I'm a technical writer, used to be pilot (kids are expensive, what with
college and all), but since they're grown up and out on their own, I get
to restart in a few months. And my wife is OK with it, too.

I've been airplane-mad as long as I can remember (still remember seeing
some F-94's overhead in East L.A.; I was about five at the time).

Interested in kayaking, cycling, hiking, messing about with ultralight
backpacking stoves and kit, reading history, particularly
aviation-related, and historical reenacting. Computers just pay the
bills.

And thanks to all those posting here who served, and currently serve.
You don't get enough recognition.

47 year old Computer Engineer.  4 Years enlisted Marines. 2 kids still in
the house, and a wife I met in Denmark back in 1982 while in the USMC.
Soloed when I was in high school (on my own dime), but with the military,
college (my dime again + the small GI bill), and life, I could never justify
finishing the license. Kid's college funds, etc took priority.

I've been a WWII aviation enthusiast since shortly after I learned to read,
but am no where near being a historian.  The adventures of the WWII
generation astound me.  Seeing Erik S on this list back in the day was like
finding gold for me.  Heck I even like Art when he's not cranky ;-)

I'm in awe of the content provided by Ed, Walt, Dudley, Guy, Peter S, Gordon
and a few others. Thanks guys!

Well the first half was about me anyway.

Cheers Doug

Me? I'm 49, degree in computer science from back when it was CS
instead of IT (boy did that throw me once when job hunting). Due to
possible reprecussions with various branchs of the federal government
I decline to comment on what I'm currently doing. Never a wife nor
kids, not even a dog currently; all three tend to want to keep track
of you.

I first came here because I've loved military aircraft as long as I
can remember. Listing to WaltBJ &amp; Ed &amp; Darrel &amp; others of the &quot;been
there and done that&quot; crowd is great; before Eric left us talking with
him was a wonder. I'm still here because I still learn something new
every now and then and some of these folk I consider friends.

Guy Swettenham 49 genuine cockney now living in Scotland, married 1
daughter.
I do contract software developent when I can not avoid it.
Always interested in aviation courtesy of dad and uncle.
Interstesed in naval history mainly 1860-1945 and Hellenistic military
history.
Developing an interest in travelling eastern Europe by train.

Always wanted to fly Lightnings but no luck &quot;wot with those feet?&quot;

First got following a search on HMS Warspite which took me to SMN and
then on to here. Every NG I find ARB seems to have been there before
me;-)
I particularly like the variety of info here, hard facts, chat about
past events, info that you just would not find in books pops up all
the time.
Also the helpfullness of people - there always seems to be someone who
can answer an obscure question.
One gripe - those people who see a topic and then post a clip from
wiki or whatever that barely relates to the subject, presumably they
like to prove they know something - irritates the hell out of me
though!

cheers

Guy

I wasn't a pilot, I was a WW II bombardier-navigator flying combat
with the 344th Bomb group, 494th Bomb Squadron 9th AF. I flew my first
mission while still a 19 year old teen ager. And I still don't believe
a plane without propellers can fly. Visit my website and you'll see
what I mean.

My life, as they say, is an open book. Well, at least some parts of my
life.

In the rest, I've been a training development specialist for Northrop
Corp, a marketing director for a national municipal finance brokerage,
a computer software reviewer for Ziff-Davis Online, and a small
college adjunct in political science.

I visit RAM because I learn stuff. And, occasionally I can contribute
something. History is fragile stuff and myth takes on a life of its
own.

&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1976 but the recruiter was shot down by his superior. It was a

&gt;&gt;&gt; Next?

&gt;&gt; Former 40 mm Boffin gunner in 129 Airfield Air Defence Battery, Royal
&gt;&gt; Canadian Artillery. Commanded Callsign 12 near the driving range on
&gt;&gt; Flugplatz Lahr in the Schwarzwald (it was near the third bend in the

I was one of the lucky ones; started in the Mustang, went through the
early jets, P/F80A/B, F-86, F101, a real learning process. Along the way
flew the Meteor and Hunter. Never had to fly anything other than
fighters. How lucky can you get.

Still fly regularly, nothing better than 10 minutes of aerobatics in my
Rans S-12 before breakfast.

Me? Concerned civilian. Manufacturing engineer. Welding, metal
stamping, machining, product data base management, and production
management background.

No military aviation credentials whatsoever. My eye glasses have
always been much too thick to ever qualify for consideration. Now they
can fix up eyesight with laser surgery, but I am now too old anyway.

Life long interest in military aircraft (hey....some people like
trains so go figure) and the technologies involved therein. Also
interested in: military strategy and the role it plays in shaping
history, economics, physics, history, law, and a host of other areas.

Concerned that we are presently on the wrong course versus &quot;the jihad&quot;
and that, in fact, we must actually work to become energy independent
with little reliance on fossil fuels.

I see a future where nuclear fusion replaces oil and alleviates this
source of tension that will most probably lead to WWIII.....unless we
act quickly and move in this new direction. Unfortunately, humans
often seem to rely on the status quo until real problems develop.

Others here are much more knowledgeable then I about things military
aviation, but I like reading the group and try to add a civilian
perspective here occasionally.

As a kid in high school I used to volunteer at the library instead of
eating lunch.  My mom gave me $5.00 dollars every week for lunch and if I
didn't spend it I could keep it.  Seemed like a good deal to me.

I was in 11th grade when the librarian asked me if I wanted to keep a stack
of old magazines instead of throwing them out.  I readily agreed.

That night I started looking at what magazines I'd brought home and noticed
one with an F-16 on the cover.  Cool!  The magazine was Aviation Week &amp;
Space Technology.

Inside was an article comparing the F-16A with Star Wars aircraft,
specifically the X-wing.

The gist of the article described the X-wing attack on the Death Star and
how the X-wings used computers to accurately fire their weapons using
onboard computers.

Next the article described a notional attack on a dam using the F-16.  The
author of the article got to ride in the back of the F-16B used in the
attack.

He described how fascinated he was with the Falcon as they flew the entire
mission following direction cues to get the to the exact dam they would be
bombing.  As they flew in for the attack the pilot told the reporter that
he would pickle the bombs and the computers would decide when to release
the bombs for an accurate hit.  The pilot thought he was in a good position
but the aircraft would decide if the pilot was right or wrong and hold the
bombs until it thought the bombs would hit the target.

Again, Cool!

I decided right then that I wouldn't be following my dad and my brother
into the Army and that I was joining the Air Force to work with aircraft
somehow.

While at MEPS I found out that the specific job I wanted (jet engine
mechanic) wasn't open at the time and that I could enlist &quot;Open General&quot;
and hope the job was open while I was Basic Training.

Once at Lackland (Gateway to the Air Force) I was allowed to make a list of
the jobs I'd be willing to take in order of my most desired down to least
desired.

Eventually I was sent to CBPO (Consolidate Base Personnel Office) to
discuss my choices.  I sat down with an assignment NCO to go over my list.

He looked at what I wanted and, &quot;This looks good but since this job
requires extra processing we have to move it to the top of your list.&quot;

Crap!

I was sent somewhere else to take an aptitude test for that job and
stupidly aced it.  Just like that I became a Radio Communications
Analyst/Security Specialist.  Later on the name of that job was changed to
Signals Intelligence Analyst.

So, in their infinite wisdom, the Air Force gave me a job that required a
TOP SECRET Codeword clearance while basically telling me, &quot;Dude, we trust
you with our nations secrets but ain't no way we're letting you touch any
of our jets!&quot;

&quot;Needs of the Service come first&quot; blah, blah, blah.

I went to tech school at Goodfellow Air Force Base, San Angelo, Texas.  It
was a nice retirement community but I was 18 and ready to see the world.

My first field site was the 6920th Electronic Security Squadron, Misawa AB,
Japan.  That's where I got my electronic &quot;name&quot;.

I and a friend went our for a couple of beers before a day watch at a bar
called 007s.  It was an &quot;American&quot; bar in that JN's (Japanese Nationals)
rarely came in.

So, there we were drinking our Sapporo's out of cups (the correct Japanese
way) when &quot;She&quot; came in.  &quot;She&quot; was a rather pretty Japanese girl who sat
at the bar near us.  Alone.

Before my friend, Steve, could say anything I said, &quot;Jeff's in hot!&quot;

I sauntered on over to her (you can only saunter if you're cool), said
hello, and asked if I could buy here a beeru.  All of this was accomplished
using broken English and drunken Nihongu.  She agreed to the beer so I
called Mamasan to bring another cup.

Mamasan showed up with an empty glass and my half drank Sapporo.  We did a
few &quot;Kampai's!&quot; before getting down to business.

She pointed at her chest and said, &quot;Fugico.  Namu Fugico&quot;.  Her name was
Fugico and I acknowledged that with a smile.  She than asked my &quot;namu&quot; and
I was happy to oblige.  I pointed at my chest and said, &quot;Jeff&quot;

&quot;Yeffu?&quot;

&quot;No, Jeff.  Ja eff.  Jeff.&quot;

&quot;Yeffu?

I've long had a pet peeve of people pronouncing my last name wrong so I
went a little over the top trying to teach Fugicoh how to say &quot;Jeff&quot;.

&quot;Yeffu?

Meanwhile, at the other end of the bar, my friend Steve was almost busting
a gut from laughing so hard at my amateur attempt to pick up the Japanese
girl.  I figured that was a good time to leave with a few shreds of dignity
left so I said my goodbye's and walked on back to Steve.  Only cool people
are allowed to saunter and I had just proved I wasn't cool.  Hell, I
couldn't even *spell* cool.

We finished our beers and walked back to base with Steve making jokes about
me &quot;going in hot&quot; and coming off target cold and floppy.  I would've made
jokes back at Steve but sometimes the truth hurts and you just keep your
mouth shut.

The next morning I went in to work and looked up at the board to see where
our section supervisor had assigned us for the day.  Instead of my real
name it simply read, &quot;Yeffu.&quot;  Steve worked fast.

That whole day I was called Yeffu by everyone and most of the next day.  It
was then the name got Americanized and I became Yeff for the rest of my Air
Force career which lasted 10 years.

After Japan I was stationed at the 6903 Electronic Security Group, Osan AB,
Korea.  I survived that tour with both my liver and my penis intact,

After Korea I went to the 6922nd Electronic Security Squadron, Clark AB,
Philippines.  Nothing happened there except a couple of attempted coups,
many typhoons, a huge earthquake, and a wife and a daughter.

Leaving the PI I went to the 48th Intelligence Squadron, Kelly Airbase, San
Antonio, Texas.  Interesting assignment in that, while in garrison, all we
did was train on the equipment, practice convoy operations, and tell war
stories.

The unit also provided the majority of the manpower to the 6975th
Electronic Security Squadron (Provisional), Riyadh AB, Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia.  I volunteered for two, three month deployments to Riyadh before
life came along and kicked me in the nads.  Suddenly the Air Force was just
a job instead of something I'd planned to devote my life.  I decided not to
reenlist. WORST. DECISION. EVER!

I separated with an honorable and was doing okay into life decided to kick
me in the nads.  Again.

I'm currently 42yo and surviving on Social Security Disability Insurance as
well as VA compensation.  I've been told that there's a very good chance
the VA will raise my rate to 100% total and permanent this month.  I could
sorta use the money.

My hobbies include being &quot;that guy&quot; and &quot;one of the usual suspects.&quot;

Life is good.  Except when it isn't

&gt; &gt;who you are and why are you here?

&gt; Me? Concerned civilian. Manufacturing engineer. Welding, metal
&gt; stamping, machining, product data base management, and production
&gt; management background.

&gt; No military aviation credentials whatsoever. My eye glasses have
&gt; always been much too thick to ever qualify for consideration. Now they
&gt; can fix up eyesight with laser surgery, but I am now too old anyway.

&gt; Life long interest in military aircraft (hey....some people like
&gt; trains so go figure) and the technologies involved therein. Also
&gt; interested in: military strategy and the role it plays in shaping
&gt; history, economics, physics, history, law, and a host of other areas.

&gt; Concerned that we are presently on the wrong course versus &quot;the jihad&quot;
&gt; and that, in fact, we must actually work to become energy independent
&gt; with little reliance on fossil fuels.

&gt; I see a future where nuclear fusion replaces oil and alleviates this
&gt; source of tension that will most probably lead to WWIII.....unless we
&gt; act quickly and move in this new direction. Unfortunately, humans
&gt; often seem to rely on the status quo until real problems develop.
">

I'd like to see a future with fusion power also, but don't think that will
alleviate world tension much. The USA would become less dependent
on foreign oil, but the OPEC countries, without the big bucks to bribe
their citizens, will become poor and destabilized....and they'll blame
it all on us.  The jihadists won't care one way or the other because
all they want to do is kill as many westerners as possible anyway, oil
be damned.  It was that way before we were in the middle east and
will probably remain that way if we left.
The environment might get better; less air and water
pollution.
Other than that I don't see much difference.
Good to think about though

Always had an interest in military aircraft since watching F-89 overfly
our schol yard as a kid.

Since PDX has/had a very good technical high school with an avaition
shop that is where I ended up.

What is cooler than a 16 year old getting to disaemble an F-84 !

But alas with glasses I knew I would not fly.
So for some reason I joined the Army.
Brain damage I supose.

Started as an 11C posted to Korea.
Back in the states at Ft Lewis got offered a slot in the motor pool.
Since 2 round fire for effect was just plain boring after our 10 or 12
per in Korea I took the job.

Left active duty at the end of that enlistment and came back to
Paradise.
Joined a local Guard unit because the commander (Terry Aitken) at the
time was the military museum curator. Did actually get to work on some
old weapons that way. Last I heard he was at the USAF museum at Wright-
Patterson...

Started an engineer program at a local college.
Got a wife not long afterwards.
Kept her for 26 years now. (or she kept me..)

Kids happen. Left college after two years and it was back to work at my
old high school summer job of house painting working for a neighbor.

Stayed in the Guard, first as a 45B small arms repairer, then a 45L and
finially a 45K as I gained rank.

Changed Guard units in 1996 and not long after got the oportunity to go
back on active duty as the FTUS (full time unit support) person.
Plus back to school for 63H.
M-1A1's have jet engines so I was getting closer to aircarft at last..

Three years there, then two more back at my old GS maintenance company
as the Readiness NCO, two over in the BN HQ as an operations guy and the
Property Book officer stopped by two years ago to offer me the Team
Chief slot.

So now I'm a supply pouge ! But life is good. Busy but good.
And I have aircraft to keep track of too.

Oh yes, if any of you are in the Pacific Northwest and ever wanted to
own your very own M35 2-1/2 ton truck look at DMRO in the near future.
I'm in the process of dropping 84 of them as excess.....

And Yeff needs to write his book...

&gt; Hmmm, I'm not exactly a regular, more like an occasional poster. Like many
&gt; others I'm an engineer and work in the energy sector. I've had an interest in
&gt; aviation since childhood but started wearing thick glasses when I was eight
&gt; so little chance for a career flying. Did spend several years as a CAP cadet
&gt; because we got to ride along on training flights occasionally.

&gt; I've worked many jobs from ditch digger, to engineering manager, to college
&gt; professor. As I make the transition from youth and vigor to experienced and

NO, NO, NO!!  That's &quot;youth and vigor to old and treacherous&quot;, get it

Yea, I'm sure that's it.

No, that's why they keep *me* around.

My turn..?

As a kid, I was in CAP, getting my first operational flight aboard a
UH-1 hunting for a missing doctor and his wife, in their, what else?,
Bonanza.  Always wanted to be in aviation, specifically in SAR.  I got
my wish.

I served three enlistments as a helicopter rescue swimmer / ASW
systems operator.  I flew in P-3, S-3, SH-3, and SH-2 ASW aircraft &amp;
helicopters.  Stationed on Dodge, in Atsugi, some time in Africa, and
deployed aboard frigates and aircraft carriers.  Deployed to the
Persian Gulf, North Arabian Sea, Sea of Ohkotsk, Pacific, Atlantic,
and as far south as the Weddell Sea and as far north as the Soviet end
of the Aleutians.  Longest unbroken period at sea was 155 days - after
a four day break, we went back out for 93 more.  Not exactly a &quot;see
the world&quot; type of deployment, although altogether, I visited 31
countries over the years.  I served as a Intel instructor for years in
various squadrons and at the wing level, teaching flightcrews the
difference between an Osa II and a Nanuchka, an Oskar from a Poppa,
and an Su-11 from a MiG 21 PF.  I helped create lessons guides and
taught classes at &quot;Boompac&quot; (Nuclear Weapons Training Center, US
Pacific Fleet), FITCPAC, and a couple other &quot;pacs&quot;.  I was one of
those guys that wore a Soviet Navy uniform.  I loved my job.  After
several deployments and overseas assignments, I was selected for duty
on an Admiral's Staff at NAS North Island.  I made the Chief's list at
9 years, served as a Designated Courier, made Sailor of the Year for
the San Diego region in 1988 and within months, I was out.  Sure was
fun while it lasted.

Backtracking to 1983, I came home from Somalia and donated a bunch of
liberated items to the local air museum, along with a big pile of
aviation photos.  Days later, they called and asked if I could come
back and ID the photos.  I didn't notice the door shutting behind me.
I've been volunteering there since.  Recently, I moved out of the
library and into working for the curators and for the second time in
my life, I can say _I love my job_.

That's me.  I have primary custody of two wonderful kids and spend my
days raising them.  Couldn't be happier unless Dave K lived close
enough to share a barbeque.  His daughter is _nearly_ as twisted as
mine.

At least they won't have gazillions of petro-dollars to buy weapons to
make trouble for us. If those societies implode and starve, at least
they will come to the realization that their &quot;prophet&quot; Mohammed sold
them a pile of turd in regards to that Islamic world domination thing
they seem to be agitating for.

The destruction of their religious dream of world domination is THE
VICTORY that we seek in the war against the jihad and the goal we must
be aiming for.....only the complete and total disillusionment of the
Islamic dream will constitute victory. Until then, they will continue
to feed on that dream and work to make it reality. Snap their dream,
and they will have to come back to the reality that everyone else
lives in.

Development of fusion power will go a long way to debasing the source
of their current illusionary dream state........the ability to
leverage their oil resources into actual world domination.

Like all predators, they currently sense a window of opportunity prior
to the technical development and large scale integration of fusion
power, where the world economy relies on their oil resources and they
can leverage that dependence into the world domination of Islam.

Don't you believe that.....we have yet to see THE REAL strain of
fascism that will arise after we leave Iraq and it falls apart back
into a dictatorship.......this time an Iranian backed Shiite
dictatorship.

The Iranians are not just jihadists that want &quot;to kill as many
westerners as possible&quot;, oil be damned. The Iranians are sophisticated
geo-political operators and rapidly developing a nationalist/fascist
bent.

The Iranians are well aware of the potential to crash the US economy
under the mountain of debt the idiots in Washington have stacked up by
gaining fascist military control of the oil supply.

Shut off the Straits of Hormuz, dominate the Iraqi oil supply,
intimidate Saudi Arabia and Gulf States with nukes, call for a Shiite
uprising in the minority Shiite populations of the ME
countries..........things could turn into a real mess.

The oil shortage would cripple the US and the financial system here
would collapse.......and they KNOW it. Dollar denominated securities
would become worthless paper............which, of course, would
certainly anger the Chinese since they have about 1.3 TRILLION in
dollar denominated securities.

Everyone and anyone holding a dollar denominated security would be
burned by it as the credability of the dollar became worthless.

THAT IS THE REAL GOAL OF THE JIHAD: to destroy the West economically.
Osama even said that. They stand right there and tell us what they are
trying to do, just like Hilter with Mien Kampf, but I am unsure anyone
is getting the message.

Reliance on foreign oil in the US's most vulnerable point. The
Achilles heel. We must absolutely overcome our reliance upon it.
