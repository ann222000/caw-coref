An 8-month-old's mother told police the infant slipped into a coma
after she accidentally swabbed the boy's nose with a cotton swab used
earlier to clean a methamphetamine pipe.

The infant was in a coma and on life support at Loma Linda University
Medical Center, where the boy's condition was described as grave. The
baby also has a fractured skull, broken arm and pneumonia.

Elizabeth Reta, 27, was arrested Thursday and booked for investigation
of felony child abuse. Her boyfriend Juan Antonio Sanchez Jr. was
being sought for his alleged role in the abuse, police Detective Al
Parra said.

Police responding to a child-not-breathing emergency call at 2:30 a.m.
Thursday found the baby in full cardiac arrest.

Reta told police she gave the baby a bath, and then used the cotton
swab to clean his nose because it was itching, Parra said. The mother
said she didn't know the swab had been used to clean a methamphetamine
pipe.

The woman didn't immediately call for help when the infant started
having seizures.

&quot;Right now it appears that he kept her from taking the baby for
medical care because he was afraid of getting caught with drug
paraphernalia and he did not want to go back to jail,&quot; Parra said.

Sanchez, who is not the baby's father, has a criminal history and is
currently on parole.

It wasn't clear when the baby suffered the broken bones. Parra said
some of the injuries may be the result of Sanchez's attempt to rouse
the baby from his seizure.

&quot;He used different methods to stimulate the baby,&quot; Parra said.

Reta's other two children, ages 8 and 10, appeared in good health and
were placed in protective custody.
