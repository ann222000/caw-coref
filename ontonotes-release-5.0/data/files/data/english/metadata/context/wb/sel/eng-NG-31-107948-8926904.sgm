Wired has a nice article about how non-sport bikes are hot sellers again:

http://www.wired.com/cars/coolwheels/news/2007/09/interbike_urbanbikers

This proves what can happen when fresh, smart people like Ms. Yeager are
put in charge of marketing, and allowed to try something different than
the same tired old formulas (More carbon!  Even fewer spokes!).

This summer I spent 2.5 weeks in southern CA, where beach cruisers are
back with a vengeance.  Everyone is riding, and teenagers are again using
bikes as their preferred mode of transportation.  There seem to be 3x as
many bike shops as 5 years ago, most of them selling beach cruisers and a
few town/city bikes.

eventually makes it unavailable.

&quot;City Bike&quot; Hot New Category at Bicycle Industry Show

--LAS VEGAS -- Some people believe that, right now, a quiet revolution is
taking place. In cities like London, San Francisco, Boston and New York,
the ranks of bicycle riders are swelling with the rise of a new breed: the
urban biker.

Traffic snarls, soaring gas prices and worries about global warming have
prompted a big boost in cycling, affecting even places like Los Angeles --
America's freeway capital -- that have traditionally given bicycles the
cold shoulder.

&quot;What's really happened in the past year is a cultural shift,&quot; says Monica
Howe, 31-year-old outreach coordinator for the Los Angeles County Bicycle
Coalition.

At Interbike 2007, the bicycle industry's giant annual trade show, the
shift toward the urban rider is loudly evident. Fancy road and mountain
bikes are clearly no longer king of the roost -- or road. It's the scads
of fixed-gear, town, single-speed and other urban bicycles that are
drawing the crowds.

The rise of the urban biker is reflected in Specialized's 2008 catalog,
which lists 34 different models of city bike to choose from.

The company is even rolling out six different versions of its ultrapopular
single-speed, fixed-gear Langster. Each model is named after a city that's
on the urban biker radar: the four cities named above, plus Chicago and
Seattle. The New York Langster has narrow handlebars for speeding through
ranks of slow-moving cars, while the Seattle model is equipped with
fenders.

&quot;People really gravitated toward bikes with that urban feel,&quot; says Travis
Widder, an associate production manager at Specialized. &quot;We wanted to give
nods toward cities where that bike sold well, where people really embraced
that category.&quot;

Interbike 2007 is a lot less sporty than years past. Clothing
manufacturers have more messenger bags on show. Jerseys and shorts are
more urban, less multi-colored lycra.

Swobo, the trendy clothing maker, recently launched its first line of
three city bikes, and is just one of several companies showing new urban
rides.

If anyone gave birth to the urban biker movement, it's probably Sky
Yaeger, Swobo's managing director.

Yaeger was responsible for designing a slew of bikes during her time as
production manager at famed Italian manufacturer Bianchi. Some of her
designs, like the fixed-gear Pista, have been elevated to cult status.
Thanks to the bike's simplicity, it became the favored transport of
urbanites like skaters and surfers.

&quot;What happened is we crossed over the bike culture into skate, surf,&quot; she
says. &quot;The kids that are doing it now wouldn't have bought a bike five
years ago. That's a huge delight to me -- because they're on bikes.&quot;

In L.A., the bike revolution is helped by shops like the grassroots
Bicycle Kitchen. &quot;It makes it easy for anyone to put together a bike
cheap,&quot; says Howe. &quot;And it made it hip, which can't hurt.&quot;

Volunteers at the Salt Lake City Bicycle Collective, a nonprofit that
provides tools and training for riders to maintain their bikes, have
experienced a huge bump in visitors.

&quot;It's gotten out of hand,&quot; says Michael Wise, the collective's treasurer.
&quot;We don't have enough volunteers to help the people coming in looking.&quot;

San Francisco's trendy Mission District is a hotbed of bicycle activity. A
bicycle lane running the length of Valencia Street is a major artery, as
hipsters in hoodies and precisely rolled, tight-fitting jeans flow along
the street.

At Valencia Cyclery, which is often proclaimed the city's best bike store,
sales associate Babs Brockaway says she's seen the number of customers
leaving with shiny new fixed-gear (&quot;fixie&quot;) and single-speed bikes
skyrocket. The store stocks five or six choices, up from a single model
two years ago. The simplicity appeals to neophyte riders overwhelmed by
too much technology.

&quot;It's simple: You just pedal,&quot; she says. &quot;This is shocking, but there are
people who buy bikes with gears, who don't shift gears.&quot;

Just across from Valencia Cyclery is Ritual Coffee Roasters, a popular
coffeehouse often stuffed full of young hipsters glued to their MacBooks.
It's also a favorite haunt of the urban biker.

Outside, Matt McDonald, a 24-year-old photographer from Boston, talks
about his fixie.

&quot;My friends in Boston were getting into these bikes, and it was just sort
of appealing to me. It's like there's nothing to worry about, and they're
just a blast to ride.&quot;

Bulldadda. Urban cycling has been with us for over 130 years

We can look forward to scooping some nice equipment at garage sales
after these trend following fixey clones get their knee replacement
surgeries.

If anyone is responsible for cyclists regaining their senses it was
you, me and freds the world over who never knew
transportation/utility/commuting cycling was ever out of &quot;fashion&quot;.

Our &quot;beaters&quot; are the real progenitors of this new bicycle breed.

Ms. Yeager just happened to pick up on the meme at a time when cities
are becoming untenable for occupants of those stinking lesser
vehicles that we've been brainwashed to accept as normal.

I've been watching the news from Interbike, and there sure are a lot of
commuter-centric bikes available. Some, I think, are going to do very well.
I think Raleigh has a hit with it's Detour Deluxe. Fully specced out
commuter(rack, fenders, dynohub, front and rear lights)--$710. Put that on
the showroom floor and watch it sell.

The shocker for me? The $2000 Breezer &quot;commuter&quot; and the Civia Cycles line,
especially the Civia. If I'm going to spend $1900 on a singlespeed, it had
better be handmade or made out of some exotic material. But Taiwanese
aluminum and a carbon fork? No thank you.

I wondered about the security of locking a $2000+ commuter to a rack, and
some folks have said that security is becoming less of a concern because so
many employers provide secure storage. That's great---but what happens when
you want to stop on the way home? Now you have to lock up the luxo-hybrid in
front of the grocery store, bodega, bar, whatever. I have a road bike on
which I commute. It goes from home to work and back. I also have a beater I
shop with. Will people with luxo-hybrids eventually end up in the same boat?
&quot;I'll park the Civia and ride the Trek to shop&quot;? LOL.

But will the dealers put it on the showroom floor? Trek had some good
commute bicycles but almost no dealers carried them. Specialized had the
Globe, a very good deal (about the same price as the Raleigh), but only
a couple of shops in my area carried them, and none close to me (one
dealer in San Francisco, one in Palo Alto). They always say, &quot;we can

dealers don't believe they will sell and don't want to use floor space
for inventory that they can't move at a good margin.

At least the REI Transfer (&quot; http://www.rei.com/product/744802 &quot;) is a
bike that you can actually try before you ride.

The suggestion from manufacturers is that &quot;things are different now&quot; and
&quot;the market is ready&quot;. Whether shop owners will commit to stocking them
remains to be seen----but the Raleigh has a much better chance of being
stocked than the Civia.

That being said, selling an expensive hybrid commuter is difficult. Selling
an expensive road bike is relatively easy. &quot;Hey, feel how light it is!&quot;, or
&quot;Hey, check out those lugs. That bike is hand made by a craftsman in
Wisconsin.&quot;. Selling an MTB is easy, too---it's all about the cutting edge
tech.

How do you convince someone to spend $3000 on a Civia, a bike which is
pretty much single purpose? If I buy a Trek Portland, I can commute on it,
race cross on it, tour on it, or put light wheels on it and go fast.  You
can't do that on a hybrid, realistically.

Nah, put a hip $500 3 speed with fenders and a rack on the floor and
it will sell. My LBS has been selling out of the Electra Amsterdams @
550, and this is freaking Nashville Tennessee. Mind, it is in a pocket
of weirdos, artists, and queers. The Amsterdam is quite nice, and has
hit a big niche--but I think that there's a parallel niche for a more
mildly retro/modern and less severe bike that's more like the standard
modern utility bikes you see in Sweden, basically hybrid geometry,
with North Road type bars and a gear hub.

I think Performance had the better plan with the World Avenue. Sell a
relatively low priced commute bicycle with racks, fenders, and most
importantly a chain guard. I wish they'd included a hub dynamo too.
OTOH, all of the factory hub-dynamo equipped bicycles I see around here
(mainly Joe Breeze and REI Transfer) have additional lights installed
because they're used in an environment where the included dynamo lights
don't cut it. If the owners knew about the SolidLight for dynamos, and
had a way to buy it here for $150 or so, I'd think it'd sell reasonably
well, since the battery powered systems on these bikes are always of the
expensive variety.

It's almost impossible to get customers to buy practical bikes. We've
stocked fully-decked-out commuter bikes, and they sit &amp; rot on the floor.
We've dressed up stock standard bikes, showing people what's available for
them, and they just collect dust and sales of fenders &amp; lighting systems
only go to those who already understand their value, not new converts to the
cause.

It's possible that the new widespread awareness of global warming may have
an effect, along with a general feeling that we ought to do a better job of
protecting the planet for the next generation. But I'm skeptical. We, as an
industry, are relatively powerless. We don't control the media, or at least
the parts that influence the lives of everyday people. The bicycle industry
is finally beginning to band together for common marketing causes, of which
utility use bicycles is a big battle cry. The feeling is that, if we can get
utilitarian use of the bicycle seen as a mainstream activity, it will raise
sales of *all* types of bicycles, thus avoiding the pitfall of creating a
beast that becomes a non-profit commodity item.

Would be nice that we actually had reason to be scared of creating such a
beast...

I think when people start noticing how sexy we are they'll pay
anything to get on the bandwagon.

Fixed gear bikes have become popular largely because of the
messengers iconic image.

If city bikes help cyclists to dress better more people will be
encouraged to ride. By coming stock with fenders having coat/skirt
protectors, chain guards and geometry that permits a more dignified
riding position people can wear their &quot;normal&quot; clothes.

Keep it lightweight, give 'em a place for their stuff and lights like
a real vehicle. At $1000 though, I'm afraid many of the new converts
will be expecting a motor.

Dear Mike,

blah-blah-blah . . .

Here's a hot new city bike that should scare us sissies, no fancy
fenders, no silly clipless pedals, no high prices:

It's your basic 80-tooth front-sprocket 1907 fixie--simple, reliable
transportation with head-light, tool-bag, sprung-seat, cruiser
handlebars, and front suspension. (Okay, 40-tooth inch-pitch.)

Cheaper is better for a dedicated commuter, I think. Of course, that depends
on the type of commute. But for something that may be locked to a rack all

&quot;Good&quot; is such a relative term.

Let's just say it's extremely rare (like never), to see one of these
commute bikes out at night using only the dynamo lights. Of course the
integrated dynamo lights are the only dynamos you're going to see around
for commuters in most parts of the U.S., for technical and demographic
reasons.

I wouldn't say they're good. They're adequate &quot;being seen lights&quot; though
the lack a standlight. They're probably good enough for riding slowly on
familiar streets.

However nothing prevents the owner from buying some better headlamps to
use with the hub dynamo.

If some large company would make the effort to build a Cree based dynamo
light in large quantities then the cost of the components of that light
would come way down.

&gt; This proves what can happen when fresh, smart people like Ms. Yeager are
&gt; put in charge of marketing, and allowed to try something different than
&gt; the same tired old formulas (More carbon!  Even fewer spokes!).

&gt; This summer I spent 2.5 weeks in southern CA, where beach cruisers are
&gt; back with a vengeance.  Everyone is riding, and teenagers are again using
&gt; bikes as their preferred mode of transportation.  There seem to be 3x as
&gt; many bike shops as 5 years ago, most of them selling beach cruisers and a
&gt; few town/city bikes.

&gt; Text of the article is below, for the Usenet archives, in case Wired
&gt; eventually makes it unavailable.

&gt; &quot;City Bike&quot; Hot New Category at Bicycle Industry Show

&gt; --LAS VEGAS -- Some people believe that, right now, a quiet revolution is
&gt; taking place. In cities like London, San Francisco, Boston and New York,
&gt; the ranks of bicycle riders are swelling with the rise of a new breed: the
&gt; urban biker.

&gt; Traffic snarls, soaring gas prices and worries about global warming have
&gt; prompted a big boost in cycling, affecting even places like Los Angeles --
&gt; America's freeway capital -- that have traditionally given bicycles the
&gt; cold shoulder.

&gt; &quot;What's really happened in the past year is a cultural shift,&quot; says Monica
&gt; Howe, 31-year-old outreach coordinator for the Los Angeles County Bicycle
&gt; Coalition.

&gt; At Interbike 2007, the bicycle industry's giant annual trade show, the
&gt; shift toward the urban rider is loudly evident. Fancy road and mountain
&gt; bikes are clearly no longer king of the roost -- or road. It's the scads
&gt; of fixed-gear, town, single-speed and other urban bicycles that are
&gt; drawing the crowds.

&gt; The rise of the urban biker is reflected in Specialized's 2008 catalog,
&gt; which lists 34 different models of city bike to choose from.

&gt; The company is even rolling out six different versions of its ultrapopular
&gt; single-speed, fixed-gear Langster. Each model is named after a city that's
&gt; on the urban biker radar: the four cities named above, plus Chicago and
&gt; Seattle. The New York Langster has narrow handlebars for speeding through
&gt; ranks of slow-moving cars, while the Seattle model is equipped with
&gt; fenders.

&gt; &quot;People really gravitated toward bikes with that urban feel,&quot; says Travis
&gt; Widder, an associate production manager at Specialized. &quot;We wanted to give
&gt; nods toward cities where that bike sold well, where people really embraced
&gt; that category.&quot;

&gt; Interbike 2007 is a lot less sporty than years past. Clothing
&gt; manufacturers have more messenger bags on show. Jerseys and shorts are
&gt; more urban, less multi-colored lycra.

&gt; Swobo, the trendy clothing maker, recently launched its first line of
&gt; three city bikes, and is just one of several companies showing new urban
&gt; rides.

&gt; If anyone gave birth to the urban biker movement, it's probably Sky
&gt; Yaeger, Swobo's managing director.

&gt; Yaeger was responsible for designing a slew of bikes during her time as
&gt; production manager at famed Italian manufacturer Bianchi. Some of her
&gt; designs, like the fixed-gear Pista, have been elevated to cult status.
&gt; Thanks to the bike's simplicity, it became the favored transport of
&gt; urbanites like skaters and surfers.

&gt; &quot;What happened is we crossed over the bike culture into skate, surf,&quot; she
&gt; says. &quot;The kids that are doing it now wouldn't have bought a bike five
&gt; years ago. That's a huge delight to me -- because they're on bikes.&quot;

&gt; In L.A., the bike revolution is helped by shops like the grassroots
&gt; Bicycle Kitchen. &quot;It makes it easy for anyone to put together a bike
&gt; cheap,&quot; says Howe. &quot;And it made it hip, which can't hurt.&quot;

&gt; Volunteers at the Salt Lake City Bicycle Collective, a nonprofit that
&gt; provides tools and training for riders to maintain their bikes, have
&gt; experienced a huge bump in visitors.

&gt; &quot;It's gotten out of hand,&quot; says Michael Wise, the collective's treasurer.
&gt; &quot;We don't have enough volunteers to help the people coming in looking.&quot;

&gt; San Francisco's trendy Mission District is a hotbed of bicycle activity. A
&gt; bicycle lane running the length of Valencia Street is a major artery, as
&gt; hipsters in hoodies and precisely rolled, tight-fitting jeans flow along
&gt; the street.

&gt; At Valencia Cyclery, which is often proclaimed the city's best bike store,
&gt; sales associate Babs Brockaway says she's seen the number of customers
&gt; leaving with shiny new fixed-gear (&quot;fixie&quot;) and single-speed bikes
&gt; skyrocket. The store stocks five or six choices, up from a single model
&gt; two years ago. The simplicity appeals to neophyte riders overwhelmed by
&gt; too much technology.

&gt; &quot;It's simple: You just pedal,&quot; she says. &quot;This is shocking, but there are
&gt; people who buy bikes with gears, who don't shift gears.&quot;

&gt; Just across from Valencia Cyclery is Ritual Coffee Roasters, a popular
&gt; coffeehouse often stuffed full of young hipsters glued to their MacBooks.
&gt; It's also a favorite haunt of the urban biker.

&gt; Outside, Matt McDonald, a 24-year-old photographer from Boston, talks
&gt; about his fixie.

&gt; &quot;My friends in Boston were getting into these bikes, and it was just sort
&gt; of appealing to me. It's like there's nothing to worry about, and they're
&gt; just a blast to ride.&quot;

&gt; ***
">

Theres never been a shortage of bikes in lower Manhattan (NYC).  Most
seem to be low end mtb types.  Just look at any traffic sign and see
them all chained up, with no seats.  Seems theft is a major problem,
and people haven't found a good way of securing their seats (or maybe
a seatless bike is just less attractive to thieves)

I really don't think it's a pricing issue, since the bike we set up as a
&quot;proof of concept&quot; machine was built around a $260 model, so the whole thing
ready to go was only around $400.  Schwinn's present entry-level &quot;commute&quot;
bike is the World GS, which is a basic hybrid with only fenders and a rear
rack added, no lights.
http://www.schwinnbike.com/products/bikes_detail.php?id=981 . In fact, there
are no lights supplied until you get all the way up to their top-of-the-line
model, the World Adventure-
http://www.schwinnbike.com/products/bikes_detail.php?id=954 .

If these bikes are selling well, it's not due to price &amp; spec, but because
Performance has gotten behind them. If so, more power to them! They're doing
a much better job (given the apparent success) than I've been able to do.
But suitability to task? In my opinion, a commute bike should be tough as
nails, and part of that is keeping things simple. I'd ditch the suspension
fork immediately, although I admit there are some environments where even
the crude forks such bikes come with might add some degree of comfort.

&gt;&gt; I think it's a matter of pricing. The reason the Schwinn World Avenue has
&gt;&gt; done relatively well is because they priced it well. On sale, with the
&gt;&gt; Team Performance discount, it goes for around $320, sometimes less. They
&gt;&gt; can't keep it in stock. It's going to be very different for a $700-1000
&gt;&gt; commuter bike, even if it includes some dynamo lights.

&gt; Cheaper is better for a dedicated commuter, I think. Of course, that depends
&gt; on the type of commute. But for something that may be locked to a rack all
&gt; day, or will be used for stops at the grocery store on the way home from
&gt; work---yes.  They're making a big deal about the dynohub lights, but I don't
&gt; know how bright these lights will be. I know that there are good generator
&gt; lights(Lumotec, etc), but are these cheap ones good?
">

The old Union U-100 headlights serve my purposes well,
as they have done for decades.  I'm sure the latest
headlight profferings have improved on beam shaping etc.
But after all, the ol' U-100 was specifically designed
for bicycling purposes too.  I luv that big, fat, shiny
disc of glow that its lens displays to onlookers.
I figure, it's not just how bright it is -- it's also
how /big/ it is.

I also have a plastic-shell'd cheap-o version of it,
which performs just as adequately.

And I have a couple of Tung-Lin headlights which are
quite fancy but have a design flaw -- the bracket
which attaches to the front brake bolt is just riveted
onto the headlight shell, and under the weight of the
headlight the rivets eventually loosen.

Anyway, the guts of an efficient headlight is the
Fresnel-ish lens, and they've been readily &amp;
inexpensively manufactured since Hector was a pup.

Generator taillights also have some qualities I prefer
over blinkies.  For one thing, they don't disappear
from a coming-from-behind drivers' view at certain
angles as readily as many blinkies do.  And they
cast a sort of big, red aura in the air around them,
much more than typical blinkie LEDs do.  Generator
taillights penetrate slight-&gt;medium fog better
than LEDs.  Neither type of light penetrates really
thick fog very well.

Generator taillights can look sharp when fender-mounted.
Mine doesn't; I kinda quick-&amp;-dirtily kludged my
jerry-built mounting.  One of these days maybe I'll
concoct some sort of streamlined housing built right
into the fender (when I get a round tuit.)

I've empirically observed a growing trend in
more practical uses of bicycles than sports
equipment, myself.

I like it.

But I also like that bicycles /can/ be sports
equipment.  Or recreational equipment.  Or
work vehicles.

Bicycles are so versatile, it blows my mind.

It's all too easy to get locked into a mindset
about one's own style of cycling, and dismiss
all the others.  But I must admit I enjoy a
certain pleasure in seeing sprouts of acceptance
of cycling as a serious, true mode of transportation.
I hope it thrives.

Some people have taken issue with the nomenclature:
&quot;city bike&quot;, and I kinda feel the same way.  I'm rather
taken with the description of bicycling as &quot;Folk
Transportation&quot;.  I suppose if one wants to be fancily
Euro about it, they can get on their VolksFahrrad.

cheers,
Tom

&gt;&gt; work---yes.  They're making a big deal about the dynohub lights, but I don't

They are good enough to do the job - ride around the city or on smaller
streets in the suburbs. Brighter than much of the slamp-on headlights with
integrated battery-compartment.

&gt;Let's just say it's extremely rare (like never), to see one of these
&gt;commute bikes out at night using only the dynamo lights.

Ridiculous. have you been to central europe: Netherlands, germany,
switzerland? Towns are full of bikes at night - most with dynamo lights!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I wouldn't say they're good. They're adequate &quot;being seen lights&quot; though
&gt;the lack a standlight.

You don't know what you are talking about. The most standard Lumotec found
on european commuter bikes today is the &quot;Lumotec Oval Senso Plus&quot; - of
course with LED-standlight powered by a capacitor. On the back nearly all
commuter bikes (at least in germany) today are equipped with
dynamo-powered LED-lights with similar capacitor-standlight.

&gt;If some large company would make the effort to build a Cree based dynamo
&gt;light in large quantities then the cost of the components of that light
&gt;would come way down.

They will be available in 2-3 weeks: Busch&amp;Müller Lumotec Fly IQ. Much
brighter and more efficient shaped beam like the Solidlights 1203D you
always praise (much dimmer than a standard Lumotec halogen light - but a
little wider). Or the Inoled 20+ Model 2008. Or the Supernova E3 Model
2008...

&gt;&gt;&gt; $1900 Breezer Finesse. You're welcome.

&gt;&gt; $1900 and no chain guard?  Fail.

&gt;. Crappy light

You don't know, what you are talking about. The Lumtec Fly IQ used here is
the brightest and best-shaped light for hub dynamos you can find. Will
beat most 20 W halogen lights!

&gt; Or just PCP and toluene? Sky Yaeger isn't at Bianchi any longer.
&gt; Bianchi also has an internal gear bike with the wrong ends and a

Well, the frame does give you the option to change over to a
conventional derailleur arrangement if you like -- and as a
manufacturer, you can use the same frame for a lot of models. It looks
to me like Schwinn just took a hybrid frame and hung a bunch of trick
stuff on it -- going the kludge route to use the internal geared hub.
At that price point, personally, I would rather have a Pilot or a
Portland. -- Jay Beattie.
