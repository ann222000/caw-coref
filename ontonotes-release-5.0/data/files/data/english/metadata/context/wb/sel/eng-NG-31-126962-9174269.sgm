So the instructions on the back of the Mrs. Smith's blueberry pie I
made this morning said to cut 4-6 slits in the top of the pie with a
knife.

My question is this: why does the Mrs. Smith's company express the
number of slits as a range?

I mean, wouldn't a single number be sufficient?

For example, why can't they just say &quot;cut 4 slits in the pie&quot;? That
would seem to be the optimal number of slits from the perspective of
time, energy expenditure, and knife wear.

Or, if they want to minimize the probability that you'll be startled
by a visit from OJ and cut the wrong number of slits, wouldn't it make
sense to say &quot;cut 5 slits in the pie&quot;? That way, if you left out or
added a slit, you'd still be in the range known to pie science to
produce acceptable results.

Or maybe the Mrs. Smith's Company is concerned with safety margins,
and minimizing the probability that a power surge will lead the pie to
explode, set fire to the toaster oven, and burn the house down killing
an elderly occupant. In that case, wouldn't it make sense to instruct
customers to cut 6 slits in the pie?

Expressing the number of slits as a range just doesn't make sense.

Its all because they did not want to use the term &quot;prick the pie&quot;
which really is the way to do it. just prick the pie with a fork, you
vcan even make some interesting designs while you are pricking the pie.

&lt;snip&gt;

Too many people don't get that the number (and style) of slits is up
to them. I know too many people who would be stressed if a number
wasn't specified. I don't understand those people, what life must be
like for them makes me tired.

If the instructions specified one particular number I'd throw it
across the room or, at the very least, I would mock the instructions
for the arbitrary choice.

Happy Thanksgiving!

How confusing is it, when there are four slits and you're trying to
cut a pie in sixths. Or worse, six slits and you're trying to cut a
pie in eighths. Optical illusions always make one slice look larger
than another.

Then the greedy cousin complains because someone got a piece with two
slits in it, and your uncle tells him to fuck off, and the cousin
takes his brother and they go home and come back with shotguns, and
pretty soon Thanksgiving dinner is spoiled for everyone.

Boy, do I feel silly that it took Josh Forrest Forrest Hill to clear things
up for me about Mrs Smith's pies.  For years I have not taken the time to
put on my reading glasses when examining the directions.  Ashamedly I have
been making 46 slits in the pie top.  I feel so...  elderly.

The pie you intend to make is probably unspeakably filthy. Throw it

It was pretty vile, actually. I mean, it had about three blueberries
in it: mostly it was that gooey colored stuff they put in cheap pies
in lieu of fruit. I shall have to write a letter to Mrs. Smith.

Fortunately, a friend gave us a home-baked apple pie. I wonder if her
family will die of smallpox now?

I just put slits there because they tell me. I mean, one day when I
was feeling really really adventurous, I put a pie in the oven without
making any slits to see what would happen. But after a few minutes
spent pacing the kitchen nervously wondering if I was doomed, the
suspense became too much for me, and I ran over to the oven, yanked
the pie out burning my hands, and hurriedly cut slits in the top. Ever
since then, I've wondered whether this whole business of slit cutting
isn't a mistake, a cosmic joke. Like maybe the manuscript said &quot;use
mitts&quot; but the typesetter needed new glasses and read it as &quot;use
slits&quot; and so Elma Trimble's Cook's Advisor and Advice on Grooming
Cats got people making slits rather than using mitts and ever since
then people have figured the slits did something really important when
in fact they don't.

And a happy Thanksgiving to you too!

give me pie and I srice so fix.&quot;

pie in a manner that will satisfy them all&quot;?

&quot;That is easy,&quot; he said. &quot;I measure angle of srices in radians. Then

&gt;&gt; So the instructions on the back of the Mrs. Smith's blueberry pie I
&gt;&gt; made this morning said to cut 4-6 slits in the top of the pie with a
&gt;&gt; knife.

&gt;&gt; My question is this: why does the Mrs. Smith's company express the
&gt;&gt; number of slits as a range?

&gt;&gt; I mean, wouldn't a single number be sufficient?

&gt;I don't know, but the whole concept is just disgusting. Why can't you
&gt;make a real pie?
