Fooya Focaccia

This column is a kvetch. A rant against bad service that turned a fondly
anticipated evening into one of stress and disappointment.

Fifteen-year-old Amir had just come back from camp and we promised to take the
family out to dinner so we could hear about some of his adventures at the Kayitz
&lt; http://www.kayitz.com/ &gt; b'Kibbutz program at Kibbutz
&lt; http://www.shluhot.org.il/ &gt; Shluchot. We chose a highly recommended Italian
café located near downtown called Al Dente
&lt; http://www.eluna.com/rest/AlDante.asp?mumu=107 &gt; .

The restaurant itself is small but functional. It hasn't received the
gentrification treatment that typifies restaurants in the heart of the city or
the Emek Refaim area. That was OK, we came for the food not necessarily the
ambiance.

We had reserved a table for five at 7:00 PM. We arrived on time but our table
wasn't set up yet. That was probably the first warning sign but we decided to
ignore it; restaurants get busy; these sort of things happen.

After we were seated, our next task was to catch our waitress' eye. A more
personable waitress would have come over to our table, asked how we were doing,
introduced herself. Ours seemed to have more important things to do. In her
defense, she was working alone and had a full house to contend with. But we
didn't appreciate having to go through that awkward dance where you strive to
appear calm while at the same time craning in convoluted positions to call over
the wait staff.

When we finally got our waitress' attention, she actually said, &quot;Oh, do you want
to order?&quot; Yes, dear, that's why we came to your wonderful establishment, in
order to eat, you know.

She took our orders in as perfunctory a manner as possible. She didn't tell us
about the specials or offer to show us the wine list. We emphasized that as soon
as nine-year-old Aviv's order was ready, could she please bring it out because
he gets hungry and restless.

In the meantime, we caught up with Amir who told us about color wars and the
camp's three day hike and visit to Rosh Hanikra. I tried to remain focused and
calm.

From where I sat I had a direct view into the kitchen so I could see the orders
when they were being put out. I noticed that our focaccia was ready and in the
serving area a good 7 minutes before the waitress did. Well, actually, she never
did. The cook realizing his creation was getting cold came out from the kitchen
and brought it to us himself, the plate no longer piping hot but at least still
mildly warm. The focaccia was baked perfectly, seasoned with rosemary, garlic
and salt. If we knew what was coming, we might have enjoyed it more leisurely
but instead we scarfed it down in just a few minutes.

20 minutes later, our waitress brought us out two of our five orders. No
explanation like &quot;the other orders are right on their way.&quot; Just plonk, here's
your food, be happy you even got it.

But I was willing to be forgiving. I had been told that &quot;real&quot; Italian cafes in
Italy notoriously serve food when it's ready, not waiting to group the orders
all together to serve everyone at once. And our food was really good.
Thirteen-year-old Merav and I had both ordered a cannelloni stuffed with ricotta
cheese, sweet potatoes and ginger. It was a unique dish, unlike any of eaten
elsewhere. Merav and I had no choice but to dig in while the rest of the table
envied our gluttony (we plied them with frequent small &quot;tastes&quot;).

It was another 15 minutes before Amir got his dish and another 10 before poor
impatient Aviv finally received his pizza margharita (which we had asked to be
brought out first). My patience was starting to wear thin and it was getting
harder to maintain pleasant conversation, the frustration of the evening growing
ever stronger like a growling belly after Yom Kippur.

My wife Jody sat there smiling as the rest of the family ate. But her food was
nowhere to be seen. At an outrageous hour and five minutes after we ordered,
with no apology or information from our overwhelmed but now clearly incompetent
waitress, and with everyone else in the family finished eating, we finally lost
it.

Jody went into the kitchen to forcefully &quot;inquire&quot; when her salmon might be
arriving. &quot;It's almost ready,&quot; the cook duly informed her. &quot;Just another few
minutes.&quot; Aviv was now resting his head on the table, ready for bed. &quot;Please
wrap it up to go,&quot; Jody told the cook. &quot;We have to leave.&quot; The cook looked
disappointed but did as he was told. No longer content to wait, Jody remained at
the kitchen window until our waitress returned to demand we receive our check
immediately.

Now, one of the only recourses one has in a frustrating situation like this is
to demonstrate protestation through a less than generous tip. So imagine our
surprise when we saw that the tip had already been &quot;graciously&quot; included in our
bill. Maybe the restaurant knew that this kind of service was par for the course
and was covering its corporate tush in advance.

Jody got her salmon wrapped up to go as requested, we paid and headed for the
car. Al Dente surely lost a customer that night. Which is a real shame because
the food was uniformly excellent (including Jody's salmon and risotto which she
finally ate upon arriving home).

If you don't mind a leisurely meal, you can certainly consider Al Dente. But if
you're going out for a family dinner with the kids, we'd recommend you look
elsewhere.

------------------------------

UPDATE: After I wrote this post, Jody was still upset by the whole experience
and decided to call Al Dente. She explained what had happened and the manager
was aghast. He promptly sent out a 15% discount for our next meal there. Other
than the fact I would have expected an entire free meal (or two) given our
suffering, the question is: do we have the time to give Al Dente another chance?
