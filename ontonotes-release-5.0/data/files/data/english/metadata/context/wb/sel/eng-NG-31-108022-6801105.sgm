Crostini con Gamberi
Shrimp Crostini

20 medium shrimp, cooked, divided
2 tablespoons ketchup
4 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon brandy
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 loaf cocktail size bread, sliced 1/4-inch thick
Parsley for garnish

Cut 12 of the shrimp into a fine dice, and reserve the remaining whole
shrimp for garnish.  Place the diced shrimp in a bowl. Add the ketchup,
mayonnaise and brandy, and season with salt and pepper. Fold the
ingredients together until they are well combined. Lightly toast the
slices of bread, and spoon the shrimp mixture onto each slice.  Garnish
with the reserved whole shrimp and top each slice with the curly parsley.
Serves 4.
