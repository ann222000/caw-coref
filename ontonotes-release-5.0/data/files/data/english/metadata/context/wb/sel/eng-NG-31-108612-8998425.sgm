Book Report

So I go out on my step and what to my wondering eyes doth appear but
the box from Amazon.com containing the Jefimenko books that Bill
Miller shamed me into finally buying. So I take a quick look inside
and decide to give an initial report here. (Too much vector math in
there for a thorough review.)

These books have some amazing advanced thinking in the understanding
of Maxwell and EM. One first thought is the consideration of
causality. This is typically totally ignored in the EM community.
Evidence of that is the fact that EM waves are widely held to be
propagated by the E field creating the H field and the H field
creating the E field as it goes along. Too bad it's just not true!
Jefimenko points out that causality demands that that an event must be
PRECEDED by it's cause! Simultaneous events CANNOT be &quot;causal&quot; of each
other. Hence E and H fields of waves are created by the WAVE SOURCE
not each other! Same things goes for the E field created by Faraday
induction. It simply cannot be &quot;caused&quot; by the time-varying Magnetic
Field. &quot;Magnetic induction&quot; is therefore a misnomer.  Such induction
is caused by the source CURRENT and NOT the magnetic field!

This leads Jefimenko on to note that contrary to the &quot;one E field&quot;
theory that has been believed for so many years, the inductive E field
is clearly NOT the same field as an electrostatic E field. Jefimenko
terms this inductive E field the &quot;Electrokinetic Field&quot; to show that
it is a different field from the electrostatic E field. Very good.
However, old habits die hard and even Jefimenko  persists in writing
an expression for a &quot;total E field&quot; following Maxwell as consisting of
a sum of the electrostatic and electrokinetic parts as if they were
both the &quot;same&quot; kind of E field.

Jefimenko then proceeds to illustrate the electrokinetic fields with a
series of calculations and examples using his formulas as an approach.
He presents it as basically a &quot;new&quot; way of doing this and in one sense
it is compared to the commonly used and non-causal bogus &quot;flux
linkage&quot; methods. However, he fails to note that the causal Neumann
formula is in essence identical to his formulation and has been a
standard formulation for years for the calculation of the
&quot;electrokinetic field&quot; or what is usually termed &quot;mutual induction&quot;.
Nevertheless his example calculations are important basic references
to the topic of Faraday induction.  And the consideration of causality
clearly shows that the Neumann approach has the edge over the &quot;flux
linkage&quot; ideas with at times fail to give correct results.

But the subject doesn't end with induction, he pulls gravity into the
mix. Of particular interest is that he shows that once you introduce
causality into Newton's theory of gravitation, interesting things
start to happen! Relativity suddenly begins to show up and even more
interesting &quot;action-reaction&quot; is soon discovered to actually be a law
that does NOT hold in all cases!  The electromagnetic nature of
gravity quickly becomes strongly hinted at and without action-reaction
laws, those dreamed of devices such as anti-gravity ships and the
&quot;force-glove&quot; that you wear to push over a building become theoretical
possibilities! These are truly books full of thought-provoking new
ways of looking at tired old physics!

I'm not going to be going through the large quantity of field theory
math in these books in a hurry, but that's OK because clearly taking
the time to go through in detail WILL be worth the effort! What can I
say? Listen to Bill Miller and get that order off to Amazon.com now.
At roughly $25 each these two books are a huge bargain to the usual EM
text books costing hundreds of dollars and then being full of bogus
ideas and misunderstandings of the established theories.  Just do it!
I did and I'm not sorry I did!

Hi Benj

Would you mind comparing it to other books at
http://all-technology.com/eigenpolls/embooks/

I got a version of this book from my library yesterday,
i look forward to reading it when I have finised my current book.

When I bought his older (vintage 60s and 70s) text on E and M, I learned why
he did this. All the examples in &quot;Causality&quot; are repeats of the same
examples in his textbook. But in the text book, he used the &quot;old fashioned&quot;
methods. He wanted to show that the new methods provided precisely the same
answers as the old (and experimentally proven) procedures did.

And isn't it nice to know that there is a sane explanation for Lentz's law?

Hello Benj...

GREAT JOB! BTW, and if you dare, after you have read the two books above,
dive into Gravitation and Cogravitation. At the very least, you'll learn why
a point at the Sun's equator and a point near the Sun's pole have different
rotation rates.

And, if you let your imagination fly, you may learn a possible explanation
for the missing mass of the universe. Or, stretch your imagination further,
look at experimental evidence, and see if you come up with a hypothesis of
what might have happened at Tanguska.

Or not.

Not right. E and H in far field are linked by space impedance Z. Thus
this equation holds:
H = E/Z and
HZ = E
They exchange energy without loss. How this energy packet got free of
the antenna is not relevant. The initial cause was the disturbance and
the two components simply obey differential equations, trading places
alternately as source and sink.
The choice of which of E or H is the cause depends on how the antenna
is designed. After that they reach an &quot; accommodation&quot; and are on a
par.
I don't think there's anything that monumental in his findings (but I
have not seen the book).

That's right, in static conditions we can identify a cause, but in the
far field it's as I described above, E and H are equivalent, neither
of which is a &quot;cause&quot;.
Don't forget, if you design the experiment you can assert a cause,
such as current in a coil. In the far field it's out of your hands.

Actually, he only explains HALF of Lenz's law. The other half having
to do with moving a magnet in and out of a coil is easily explained if
one carefully examines the relative motions of the coil, the magnetic
field and resultant current using the Lorentz qVxB relation.  As he
does mention induction consists of two cases. One where things move
and you use the Lorentz equations and the other where things don't
move and you calculate the &quot;electrokinetic&quot; field.

Actually time IS a factor. The question is not is there a relationship
between E and H. There is. But if the relationship is not &quot;retarded&quot;
then there can be no &quot;causality&quot; of one for the other. BOTH are then
in fact caused by some third common source. In the case of an EM wave
Jefimenko notes: &quot;Therefore we must conclude than an EM field is a
dual entity always having an electric and magnetic component
simultaneously created by their common sources: time-variable electric
charges and currents.&quot; Jefimenko in a footnote observes that this idea
is not entirely new by referencing some previous papers touching on
the subject.

OK?

&gt;    H = E/Z and
&gt;    HZ = E
&gt; They exchange energy without loss. How this energy packet got free of

&gt; par.

See what I wrote to Sue with the Quote from one of the books. What you
say about the initial cause being the initial disturbance in the
antenna is correct.  Thenceforth E and H simply obey their own
relations but do not &quot;cause&quot; each other. The widely held belief is
that energy flows back and forth between the Electric and Magnetic
fields because each one &quot;causes&quot; the other. The concept is that the
propagating waves act like energy flowing back and forth between an
inductor and a capacitor. But in that case they DO &quot;cause&quot; each other
to operate because of the time delay between the flow of energy. But
in the wave case you find that E and H are caused simultaneously and
hence cannot cause each other. In other words in a TEM wave, for
example, both fields rise and fall in magnitude together. In the tuned
circuit there is a phase (time) shift. While Jefimenko sort of ignores
the point, in the case of steady state sinusoidal waves, (as you bring
up in the case of Far Fields of antennas) there is a matter of phase
shifts which because the functions are repeating can lead to erroneous
conclusions about causality and other things (remember the thread here
a while back about superluminal waves in the antenna near field where
an attempt was made to measure time by measuring phase?)  It can be
sorted out, but Jefimenko apparently didn't think it worth the effort
to try since the point had already been made in general.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't think there's anything that monumental in his findings (but I
&gt; have not seen the book).
">

Depends what you mean by monumental.  When there are a number of
constantly repeated misconceptions in the field, it may not be
monumental but it seems to me at least to be important that someone
bothers to point them out. Two of these are that the Electrokinetic
field is NOT an electrostatic E field. The &quot;one E field&quot; concept of
Maxwell and his followers is wrong.  And another is that in a
propagating wave that E and H &quot;create&quot; each other as they go along.
The latter apparently is one that you still believe, so in that sense
I guess for you there is at least ONE thing in the book that is
&quot;monumental&quot;.

I really don't want to be speaking for Jefimenko here and defending
his work. But I do think that much of it already speaks for itself
quite well.

&gt;&gt; Book Report

&gt;&gt; So I go out on my step and what to my wondering eyes doth appear but
&gt;&gt; the box from Amazon.com containing the Jefimenko books that Bill
&gt;&gt; Miller shamed me into finally buying. So I take a quick look inside
&gt;&gt; and decide to give an initial report here. (Too much vector math in
&gt;&gt; there for a thorough review.)

&gt;&gt; These books have some amazing advanced thinking in the understanding
&gt;&gt; of Maxwell and EM. One first thought is the consideration of
&gt;&gt; causality. This is typically totally ignored in the EM community.
&gt;&gt; Evidence of that is the fact that EM waves are widely held to be
&gt;&gt; propagated by the E field creating the H field and the H field
&gt;&gt; creating the E field as it goes along. Too bad it's just not true!
&gt;&gt; Jefimenko points out that causality demands that that an event must be
&gt;&gt; PRECEDED by it's cause! Simultaneous events CANNOT be &quot;causal&quot; of each
&gt;&gt; other. Hence E and H fields of waves are created by the WAVE SOURCE
&gt;&gt; not each other! Same things goes for the E field created by Faraday
&gt;&gt; induction. It simply cannot be &quot;caused&quot; by the time-varying Magnetic
&gt;&gt; Field. &quot;Magnetic induction&quot; is therefore a misnomer.  Such induction
&gt;&gt; is caused by the source CURRENT and NOT the magnetic field!

&gt;&gt; This leads Jefimenko on to note that contrary to the &quot;one E field&quot;
&gt;&gt; theory that has been believed for so many years, the inductive E field
&gt;&gt; is clearly NOT the same field as an electrostatic E field. Jefimenko
&gt;&gt; terms this inductive E field the &quot;Electrokinetic Field&quot; to show that
&gt;&gt; it is a different field from the electrostatic E field. Very good.
&gt;&gt; However, old habits die hard and even Jefimenko  persists in writing
&gt;&gt; an expression for a &quot;total E field&quot; following Maxwell as consisting of
&gt;&gt; a sum of the electrostatic and electrokinetic parts as if they were
&gt;&gt; both the &quot;same&quot; kind of E field.

&gt;&gt; Jefimenko then proceeds to illustrate the electrokinetic fields with a
&gt;&gt; series of calculations and examples using his formulas as an approach.

&gt; When I bought his older (vintage 60s and 70s) text on E and M, I learned
&gt; why he did this. All the examples in &quot;Causality&quot; are repeats of the same
&gt; examples in his textbook. But in the text book, he used the &quot;old
&gt; fashioned&quot; methods. He wanted to show that the new methods provided
&gt; precisely the same answers as the old (and experimentally proven)
&gt; procedures did.

&gt; And isn't it nice to know that there is a sane explanation for Lentz's
&gt; law?

&gt;&gt; He presents it as basically a &quot;new&quot; way of doing this and in one sense
&gt;&gt; it is compared to the commonly used and non-causal bogus &quot;flux
&gt;&gt; linkage&quot; methods. However, he fails to note that the causal Neumann
&gt;&gt; formula is in essence identical to his formulation and has been a
&gt;&gt; standard formulation for years for the calculation of the
&gt;&gt; &quot;electrokinetic field&quot; or what is usually termed &quot;mutual induction&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Nevertheless his example calculations are important basic references
&gt;&gt; to the topic of Faraday induction.  And the consideration of causality
&gt;&gt; clearly shows that the Neumann approach has the edge over the &quot;flux
&gt;&gt; linkage&quot; ideas with at times fail to give correct results.

&gt;&gt; But the subject doesn't end with induction, he pulls gravity into the
&gt;&gt; mix. Of particular interest is that he shows that once you introduce
&gt;&gt; causality into Newton's theory of gravitation, interesting things
&gt;&gt; start to happen! Relativity suddenly begins to show up and even more
&gt;&gt; interesting &quot;action-reaction&quot; is soon discovered to actually be a law
&gt;&gt; that does NOT hold in all cases!  The electromagnetic nature of
&gt;&gt; gravity quickly becomes strongly hinted at and without action-reaction
&gt;&gt; laws, those dreamed of devices such as anti-gravity ships and the
&gt;&gt; &quot;force-glove&quot; that you wear to push over a building become theoretical
&gt;&gt; possibilities! These are truly books full of thought-provoking new
&gt;&gt; ways of looking at tired old physics!

&gt;&gt; I'm not going to be going through the large quantity of field theory
&gt;&gt; math in these books in a hurry, but that's OK because clearly taking
&gt;&gt; the time to go through in detail WILL be worth the effort! What can I
&gt;&gt; say? Listen to Bill Miller and get that order off to Amazon.com now.
&gt;&gt; At roughly $25 each these two books are a huge bargain to the usual EM
&gt;&gt; text books costing hundreds of dollars and then being full of bogus
&gt;&gt; ideas and misunderstandings of the established theories.  Just do it!

&gt; Hello Benj...

&gt; GREAT JOB! BTW,
">

I am glad you got that from it.  My take is it basically is reading too much
into pictures that help in understanding the equations.  The equations, in
this case Maxwells equations, are the physics - not the pictures.  Feynman
proved ages ago fields are not required - everything can be formulated in
terms of action at a distance.  However the quantum version of that theory
has never been worked out.  It seems fields are required by QM.

Thanks
Bill

&gt; &quot;Causality Electromagnetic Induction and Gravitation&quot;
&gt; &quot;Electromagnetic Retardation and the Theory of Relativity&quot;
&gt; both by Oleg D. Jefimenko

&gt; Benj
">

Let me add my encouragement for others to read Jefimenko's books.
I have tremendous respect for this GOM (Grand Old Man), not least
because he is prepared to set his own course &amp; go against the crowd
(who are overwhelmingly followers of the orthodoxy &amp; not independent
thinkers).  He has made a significant contribution by reminding the
physics community of the importance of the concept of retardation, an
idea pioneered by that long-forgotten hero of EM theory - L. V. Lorenz
(he of the 'condition', not H. A. Lorentz). In 1867 LVL derived ALL of
the results of Maxwell's famous 1865 EM paper without using any field
theory, just the idea of retardation added to Newtonian action-at-a-
distance; in other words, a small modification of the good stuff, not
the radical replacement, implied by Maxwell's introduction of his
religiously motivated field theory (&quot;God immanent &amp; always active&quot;).
It is also a pity that physicists still talk about the electric field
(E) and the magnetic field (B) as both are due to intra-electric
effects but that's a reflection of the inertia of human history.  It
would be more accurate to talk about the motional EM force (M = dA/dt
+ curl A; i.e. the &quot;moving twist&quot; impulse between source &amp; target
electrons) and the velocity INdependent EM force (S = -grad V or the
remote effects purely of changing spatial/temporal separation between
electrons).
EM is about the potentials V,A, not 'fields' (that is force
densities); that's why EM still works for point electricity
(electrons) when the original aether model &quot;bit the dust&quot;, was patched
up with &quot;electric fluid&quot; and potentials were finally rediscovered with
QM.

Is he using cgs or SI/mks in his equations, or is that topic even
broached?
Anyway, causal relationships are to be found not in Maxwell's
equations but in the constitutive equations
D = eps0 E   not D = E
B = mu0 H    not  B = H
So, in the first eqn, E seems to cause D using the medium parameter
eps0, as in charging a capacitor.
But as soon as the charging wires are removed from the charged
capacitor, the dielectric immediately changes from being a sink to
forming a  voltage source V, now being a cause, rather than effect.
The field E is still in the capacitor only as a result of the
polarization due to the charges being &quot;stuck&quot; and only releasable with
a shorting bar or other closed path.
?SI or cgs? It sounds like he uses cgs, whose practitioners will
vigorously defend such apostosies as D=E + B=H.

The paper by Jackson:

&quot;Therefore we must conclude than an EM field
is a  dual entity always having an electric

The ~need~ to have one force create the other usually

&gt;&gt; Book Report

&gt;&gt; So I go out on my step and what to my wondering eyes doth appear but
&gt;&gt; the box from Amazon.com containing the Jefimenko books that Bill
&gt;&gt; Miller shamed me into finally buying. So I take a quick look inside
&gt;&gt; and decide to give an initial report here. (Too much vector math in
&gt;&gt; there for a thorough review.)

&gt; I was a graduate student at West Virginia University 1968-1972. I took
&gt; Jefimenko's E&amp;M course and acted as his graduate assistant for awhile,
&gt; getting to know the man and his work.

&gt; Jefimenko has a valid PhD and is a tenured professor in a legitimate,
&gt; PhD-granting university. However, after he obtained tenure he began
&gt; stating
&gt; his 'theories' and writing books. His E&amp;M book contains a lot of useful
&gt; material, but after publishing it he went around the bend. He is a bright
&gt; crank.
">

This is a fascinating assessment. If true, then it would likely also be true
that his output would also be &quot;crank-like&quot;

In this case, then the keystone of his work -- now called Jefimenko's
equations -- should be bogus. But it seems that it is not.

Using a different set of procedures, these equations seem to precede
Jefimenko by some years. Kirk McDonald pointed this out in his paper, The
relation between expressions for time-dependent electromagnetic fields given
by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips, American Journal of Physics 65
(11) (1997), 1074-1076:

The book in question is: Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, Melba Phillips, Classical
Electricity And Magnetism, Addison-Wesley (2nd. ed - 1962), Section 14.3.
The electric field is written in a slighlty different - but completely
equivalent - form. Reprint: Dover Publications (2005), ISBN 978-0486439242.

But it seems that no one took the time to understand the implications of the
relationships between E, H, current and charges that were revealed by
Panofsky and Phillips. So this work languished -- perhaps seen by many as
yet another example of taking a simple concept and making it complicated. An
old boss of mine used to call this &quot;gilding a turd.&quot;

In (stark?) contrast, Jefimenko starts with the concepts of retardation and
causality and with a logical progression, comes to the same conclusions as
Panofsky and Phillips.

Then he does something that they did not do: He explains why the results are
important.

Over the years, Jefimenko has published numerous articles in peer-reviewed
publications. While his early works are not particularly distinguished, his
later published works draw/rely on the core concepts revealed in the books
that Benj reviewed. A partial list is at :
http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/EM/

Those with access to the journals where these appeared -- and the
intellectual curiosity to pursue truth over opinion -- are urged to not only
read his work but look at the (few) rebuttals to see whether any rebuttal
successfully negates his original concepts.

Book reviews welcome!

&gt; idea pioneered by that long-forgotten hero of EM theory - L. V. Lorenz
&gt; (he of the 'condition', not H. A. Lorentz). In 1867 LVL derived ALL of
&gt; the results of Maxwell's famous 1865 EM paper without using any field

Well, Lorenz came up with a mathematically equivalent theory. I wouldn't
claim he derived _all_ of Maxwell's 1865 results, especially since Maxwell
had results explicitly pertaining to the E,D,H,B fields. But Lorenz's
theory was a _field_ theory; the fields were the vector and scalar
potentials instead of the E,D,H,B fields (or, as in Maxwell's theory, the
vector and scalar potential and the E,D,H,B fields). Lorenz's potentials
weren't the same as Maxwell's, since Maxwell used the Coulomb gauge and
Lorenz the Lorenz gauge.

Ritz's electromagnetics is an interesting case - almost like Lorenz's,
with retarded potentials, but fundamentally not a field theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The potentials are fields, but that's semantics. Classical EM works
either way, or even without fields at all, just direct interparticle
interaction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that's why EM still works for point electricity
&gt; (electrons) when the original aether model &quot;bit the dust&quot;, was patched
&gt; up with &quot;electric fluid&quot; and potentials were finally rediscovered with
&gt; QM.
">

Since when did potentials ever disappear from use? They've been a popular
tool. Well, Maxwell and Lorenz gave them a primary place, and then they
were relegated to being a mathematical convenience by Hertz and Heaviside
(but both being hardcore ether-men, perhaps this was not their aim).

What do you mean by 'patched up with &quot;electric fluid&quot;'?

Anyway, point charges are deeply problematical in classical EM. At the
very least, in comes renormalisation.

But as it turns out the advanced/retarded wave thing has been shown to
be true and valid. Of course using EM waves there is the minor problem
that causality is a natural law so one  usually does not have access
to to both the advanced and retarded waves. However, people in various
ways have approximated the advanced waves and lo we find that wondrous
effects are observed.  However, because of causality the applications
are rather limited in practical cases. But the implications for the
philosophy of a multidimensional manifold model of the universe could
be immense.  But generally speaking physics has not yet matured enough
to be willing to consider events beyond simple, readily repeatable,
and limited scope observations. Psychic, paranormal, or &quot;miraculous&quot;
events, not to mention transient events are currently WAY off limits
to establishment physics. If a simple examination of causality ruffles
feathers imagine what an investigation of THOSE topics would do! (Heh,
And they thought Jefimenko was a &quot;crank&quot;!)

&gt;&gt; Nope.  It id widely held to, classically, be the solution to Maxwells

&gt; Um, sure, however the FIRST thing Jefimenko points out is that
&gt; Maxwells equations in the form usually  presented, are not causal

Hmmmm.  Is the claim that Maxwells equations in standandard form does not
have solutions uniquely determined by initial conditions?  That would seem
to contradict some pretty fundamental theorems of partial differential
equations from, for example, Generalised Functions and Partial differential
Equations by Avner Friedman that I am studying at the moment.  Maxwells
equations look of the form of a generalised Cauchy Problem, which from page
237 always has a unique solution - admidedly not as proper functions - but
generalised functions.

``So,'' you might say, ``why did you bother mentioning this displacement
current thing in the first place if it is undetectable?'' Again, a perfectly
fair question. The answer is that the displacement current is detectable in
some experiments. Suppose that we take an FM radio signal, amplify it so
that its peak voltage is one hundred volts, and then apply it to the
parallel plate capacitor in the previous hypothetical experiment. What size
of magnetic field would this generate? Well, a typical FM signal oscillates
at  Hz, so  in the previous example changes from  seconds to  seconds. Thus,
the induced magnetic field is about  gauss. This is certainly detectable by
modern technology. So, it would seem that if the electric field is
oscillating fast then electric induction of magnetic fields is an observable
effect. In fact, there is a virtually infallible rule for deciding whether
or not the displacement current can be neglected in Eq. (413). If
electromagnetic radiation is important then the displacement current must be
included. On the other hand, if electromagnetic radiation is unimportant
then the displacement current can be safely neglected. Clearly, Maxwell's

For the majority of us who do not have the book,   several of
Jefimenko's equations are shown in Wikipedia and they are mightily
abstruse. Why are we arguing about his way-out equations and doubting
the existence of Maxwells displacement current, if Jefimenko has not
first stated clearly what he thinks happens in a simple vacuum
capacitor?
What happens there is mighty interesting and brutally fundamental. You
have to get that straight first.  I somewhere else showed that 10^6
V/m will extrude and polarize the vacuum charges by 6x10^-25m being
delta = E*e/K. That makes D = .009C/m^2.  That same &quot;extrusion&quot; or
polarization in RF radiation is the oscillating displacement current.

That's a nicely done paper (node46) but I have two objections. The
Maxwell equations are written re E and B but they should be in E and H
which are both definable as causes, while D and B are the result of E
and H  working on eps0 and mu0. For symmetry E and H go together.
Secondly, Eq. 420 shows a lack of awareness with eps0mu0dE/dt =
dE/dt/c^2. . It makes more sense to separate variables, dviding
through by mu0. Then curl B = eps0 dE/dt, or more properly, curl B =
dD/dt.
That's where the displacement current comes from. It is mileading to
imply it comes from dE/dt.

IMHO the answer is neither.  Since, as shown by Feynman, EM can be
formulated without the use of fields, it is a non issue.  To be specific, a
theory exists that is mathematically equivalent to Maxwells equations that
makes no use of fields, so displacement current does not exist as part of
that model.  It is quite possible displacement current is simply an artefact
of the concept of 'field' that simplifies the equations.  Without fields
standard conservation laws like conservation of momentum do not hold - which
is the real reason for their introduction.  They simplify the math and its

I'm not much of a mathematician but I presume you mean that since
differential equations can be shown to have solutions over a region
extending from boundary conditions and assuming these equations are
using time as a variable that this automatically implies that
maxwell's equations are causal.  I guess that is correct as far as it
goes, but Maxwell's equations aren't formulated in this manner in the
standard form. Jefimenko notes (this is his theory not mine) that when
two events happen simultaneously they can't be causal of each other. I
agree with that. The two events must have a THIRD cause which is
causing BOTH events. In other words the causality is the initial
boundary condition of both fields and not one field upon the other.
Hence E and H in traveling waves can't &quot;create&quot; each other as is often
held.  Jefimenko notes that this doesn't &quot;invalidate&quot; Maxwell's
equations, just that you must write them in a different form so that
one side of the equation is causal of the the other side. I'm not
trying to explain the details of Jefimenko's formulation since I've
only just given his books a cursory scan and probably wouldn't be up
to the math to do it anyway.  But I do think it's an interesting
approach to field theory.

It is EM formulated in terms of action at a distance aka Fyenman-Wheeler
absorber theory.  If you have access to journals see Review of Modern
Physics volume 21-3 July 1949.  Since then further work has been done.  In
1966 Van Dam, and Wigner, published a famous no go theorem that says without
fields standard quantities such as momentum will not be conserved; but if
you are willing to put up with that then they can be done away with - which
is exactly what Feynman and Wheeler did.  It can be proven their theory is
logically equivalent to Maxwells equations (my references quote Sudarshan -
Fields and Quanta 1972 - page 175).  This proves that fields are simply a
theoretical definition that makes the conceptualisation and math easier.
They have no 'reality'.  Because of that displacement current is simply a
concept that comes about from making the math and conceptualisation easier.
It makes no difference to the logical coherence of EM if it experimentally
detectable or not.

That is probably where you and I diverge.  My background and motivation is
using math to understand things - especially issues in physics.  I suppose I
am more of a mathematical physicist than a physicist.  I am doing research
work at the moment on Hida distributions, stochastic differential equations,
Feynman path integrals and the like.
http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0303.4712

I have recently discovered a very neat formulation in terms of Wick products
I am currently writing a series of papers about.  It does away with
filtration and the other usual  paraphernalia of stochastic differential
equations.   I have finished the first one on Dirac spaces that provides the
background in rigged Hilbert spaces necessary to understand these theories.
I am working on others to provide simler background in Brownian motion etc
before writing my research up.  This is just by the by so you understand
where I am coming from.

Here I differ.  SR allows 'events' to happen simultaneously and be causally

down to definitions that cause the problem by defining stuff you shouldn't

the EM waves that leave the flashlight do not behave like a straight line

I think we are really saying the same things here, but it's just a
word problem!  We both agree that they are a Cauchy problem with
unique solutions. That means that they are in essence causal, right?
But what Jefimenko points out is that when you write an EQUATION it
only says that the two sides are EQUAL. It does not necessarily imply
that one side of the equation is the CAUSE of the things on the other
side!  One may have to re-arrange the quantities to achieve that
form.

I think you have precisely defined the problem here in spite of saying
you &quot;differ&quot;. If, for example one tries to write some equations
describing the various flashes of the lights upon the clouds as a
series of &quot;events&quot; whereby the next flash is &quot;caused&quot; by the previous
flash, you arrive at a description that is simply wrong even though it
correctly predicts the next flash! The flashes are in fact &quot;caused&quot; by
the flashlight and it's motion and the transmission of light from it
to the various clouds. The previous flash does not in any way &quot;cause&quot;
the next flash. Nevertheless the timing of the various flashes IS
connected in ways that can be calculated, but it is not causality.
THAT is really jefimneko's main point. The fine point here is between
one event &quot;causing&quot; another versus your term of two events being
&quot;causally connected&quot;.  Two events may be equal and &quot;causally
connected&quot; but in fact do not cause each other. (Example: E and H in
TEM waves)

I think what the problem is that you assumed I was saying that
Maxwell's equations were not in anyway causal. That was not the case.
The point is that Maxwell's equations as typically presented in
textbooks are a set of equations whereby the left side of the equation
is NOT the &quot;cause&quot; of the right side. They only show a relationship.
Causality is not an issue. The so-called Jefimenko Equations, on the
other hand are the SAME set of relationships but horsed around until
you have a set of equations where the left side gives the CAUSE of the
right side. Basically the same equations, just a different form. Does

&gt; &gt;&gt; inherent in the idea of a 'sweep'.

&gt; &gt; I think you have precisely defined the problem here in spite of saying
&gt; &gt; you &quot;differ&quot;. If, for example one tries to write some equations
&gt; &gt; describing the various flashes of the lights upon the clouds as a
&gt; &gt; series of &quot;events&quot; whereby the next flash is &quot;caused&quot; by the previous
&gt; &gt; flash, you arrive at a description that is simply wrong even though it
&gt; &gt; correctly predicts the next flash! The flashes are in fact &quot;caused&quot; by
&gt; &gt; the flashlight and it's motion and the transmission of light from it
&gt; &gt; to the various clouds. The previous flash does not in any way &quot;cause&quot;
&gt; &gt; the next flash. Nevertheless the timing of the various flashes IS
&gt; &gt; connected in ways that can be calculated, but it is not causality.
&gt; &gt; THAT is really jefimneko's main point. The fine point here is between
&gt; &gt; one event &quot;causing&quot; another versus your term of two events being
&gt; &gt; &quot;causally connected&quot;.  Two events may be equal and &quot;causally
&gt; &gt; connected&quot; but in fact do not cause each other. (Example: E and H in
&gt; &gt; TEM waves)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The two events must have a THIRD cause which is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; causing BOTH events. In other words the causality is the initial
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; boundary condition of both fields and not one field upon the other.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hence E and H in traveling waves can't &quot;create&quot; each other as is often
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; held.  Jefimenko notes that this doesn't &quot;invalidate&quot; Maxwell's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; equations, just that you must write them in a different form so that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one side of the equation is causal of the the other side. I'm not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; trying to explain the details of Jefimenko's formulation since I've
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only just given his books a cursory scan and probably wouldn't be up
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to the math to do it anyway.  But I do think it's an interesting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approach to field theory.

&gt; &gt;&gt; My concern has to do with the statement Maxwells equations are not
&gt; &gt;&gt; casual.
&gt; &gt;&gt; By the definition of casual they are - hence my, in hindsight,
&gt; &gt;&gt; injudicious
&gt; &gt;&gt; original remark about misconceptions.

&gt; &gt; I think what the problem is that you assumed I was saying that
&gt; &gt; Maxwell's equations were not in anyway causal. That was not the case.
&gt; &gt; The point is that Maxwell's equations as typically presented in
&gt; &gt; textbooks are a set of equations whereby the left side of the equation
&gt; &gt; is NOT the &quot;cause&quot; of the right side. They only show a relationship.
&gt; &gt; Causality is not an issue. The so-called Jefimenko Equations, on the
&gt; &gt; other hand are the SAME set of relationships but horsed around until
&gt; &gt; you have a set of equations where the left side gives the CAUSE of the
&gt; &gt; right side. Basically the same equations, just a different form. Does
&gt; &gt; that make sense?

&gt; Hmmmm..  Perhaps.  LET is experimentally indistinguishable from SR, but is a
&gt; different theory, even though it has exactly the same equations.  The thing
&gt; is of course if such a designation is an actual advance.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; And thanks for the Feynman references! I'll look into it. Sounds very
&gt; &gt; interesting!

&gt; It is.  Timo Nieminen sent me my copy and it open-end my eyes a lot.

Hi Timo, as I have a few minutes I thought I might respond to your
excellent post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, Lorenz came up with a mathematically equivalent theory. I wouldn't
&gt; claim he derived _all_ of Maxwell's 1865 results, especially since Maxwell
&gt; had results explicitly pertaining to the E,D,H,B fields. But Lorenz's
&gt; theory was a _field_ theory; the fields were the vector and scalar
&gt; potentials instead of the E,D,H,B fields (or, as in Maxwell's theory, the
&gt; vector and scalar potential and the E,D,H,B fields). Lorenz's potentials
&gt; weren't the same as Maxwell's, since Maxwell used the Coulomb gauge and
&gt; Lorenz the Lorenz gauge.
">

Yes, read his 1867 &amp; he derived all of Maxwell's results in terms of
the retarded potentials (Maxwell only used instantaneous potentials,
like the Coulomb).  He did not derive the magnetic equations but he
only had to DEFINE B = curl A to do so.
Yes, he only needed D &amp; H for polarized electrical media, not the
empty vacuum.
Lorenz's theory was an action-at-a-distance theory as it was ONLY
defined at the location of real charges - Maxwell's theory is a field
theory as it needs to be defined at EVERY point in space.  Maxwell's
gauge choice was WRONG - electric forces do NOT propagate
instantaneously (nothing does): this is NOT a matter of choice or
convenience, as many EM authors propose.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ritz's electromagnetics is an interesting case - almost like Lorenz's,
&gt; with retarded potentials, but fundamentally not a field theory.

Yes, Ritz re-invented the Lorenz theory as it had unfortunately not
received the attention it deserved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; in other words, a small modification of the good stuff, not
&gt; &gt; the radical replacement, implied by Maxwell's introduction of his
&gt; &gt; religiously motivated field theory (&quot;God immanent &amp; always active&quot;).

&gt; I'd say mechanically motivated, not religiously motivated. Lots of talk in
&gt; the early papers about mechanism, rather little about God. Some of
&gt; Maxwell's religious writing has been taken quite of of context by certain
&gt; later writiers.
">

No, read Goldman's Maxwell biography.  Maxwell &amp; Faraday were both
intensely religious men who took Bishop Berkley's views literally,
namely: space was filled with the active presence of God.  Both would
never deny their primary motivation.
Yes, Maxwell's first two papers on EM (1859 &amp; 1861) were attempts to
provide a mechanism for Faraday's idea of space filled with 'lines-of-
force'.  Neither worked but Maxwell retained the mathematical insights
from these studies in his last (1864) 'Dynamical' paper which simply
proposed a mathematical Hamilton/Lagrange approach to give him the
results he wanted (&amp; obtained earlier by McCullagh with his vortex
model; FitzGerald later proved these two theories were mathematically
isomorphic).

&gt; &gt; EM is about the potentials V,A, not 'fields' (that is force
&gt; &gt; densities);

&gt; The potentials are fields, but that's semantics. Classical EM works
&gt; either way, or even without fields at all, just direct interparticle
&gt; interaction.
">

Yes, it is about semantics, IOW the MEANING of words, science is first
about words (i.e. natural philosophy) and only later (&amp; sometimes)
about math.  Classical EM is NOT about inter-particle interactions but
about the effects of charge-density distributions (static &amp; in motion)
on a charged point-particle.  This was the subtle (&amp; unrealized)
contribution of H A Lorentz when he made the field point in the
continuous Maxwell/Helmholtz EM theory a single point particle (later
renamed the electron) with a quantum (non-continuous) charge. I have
found NO papers describing classical EM between PAIRS of classical
point charges.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; that's why EM still works for point electricity
&gt; &gt; (electrons) when the original aether model &quot;bit the dust&quot;, was patched
&gt; &gt; up with &quot;electric fluid&quot; and potentials were finally rediscovered with
&gt; &gt; QM.

&gt; Since when did potentials ever disappear from use? They've been a popular
&gt; tool. Well, Maxwell and Lorenz gave them a primary place, and then they
&gt; were relegated to being a mathematical convenience by Hertz and Heaviside
&gt; (but both being hardcore ether-men, perhaps this was not their aim).
">

Maxwell's potentials are not valid; it is only the retarded Lorenz
potentials that are significant.  Yes, it was EXACTLY Heaviside's aim
to get rid of potentials which he associated (correctly) with 'spooky'
action-at-a-distance.  Hertz never agreed with Maxwell's view of
electric charge as a 'tear in the aether' (Maxwell's 'displacement'
concept).  He viewed EM from Helmholtz's model.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What do you mean by 'patched up with &quot;electric fluid&quot;'?
">

This was the Helmholtz approach (he first developed a perfect-fluid
model for the continuous velocity field) that was later converted to a
field theory by multiplying the velocity vector at a point by the
charge-density at the point.  Reputable physicists like Pauli, in his
ED Lectures, try to bring in limit processes to make this approach
respectable - the problem is that these limits conflict with the limit
processes defining differential change at a point.  This is now the
conventional approach to teaching advanced classical EM (see Jackson)
following Abraham's original text in 1904.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, point charges are deeply problematical in classical EM. At the
&gt; very least, in comes renormalisation.
">

Exactly my point, Timo.  Classical EM is fundamentally an
approximation theory (we don't have to bring in quantum effects &amp;
'renormalization').  It does NOT even work clasically with real point
charges - the electrons that supposedly Lorentz introduced into EM in
1897.  Why QED should believe that Maxwell's Equations need only be
'quantized' when the whole micro-theory is flawed is beyond me!
Cheers, 'Maxwell'
