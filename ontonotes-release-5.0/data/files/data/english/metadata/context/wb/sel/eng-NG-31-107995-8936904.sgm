They're bulky, though.  Best use I've seen is for a guy who would
otherwise be in a wheelchair, due to a few abbreviated limbs.  Pretty
impressive how manouverable it is; his wheels are larger than stock and
I think he said it's &quot;geared&quot; differently (but I'm pretty sure it's
direct drive from the motor).

The school I work for has about 8 or 10 of them campus wide. 1 is in our
department. The campus is about 1 mile on each of the 4 sides, so we have a
lot of ground to cover. The staff that uses our Segway, is almost fully
estimators that need to carry very little equipment, but do sometime need to
be across campus quickly. The tech's seldom use the Segway, because we need
to carry tools and supplies. The other options, for both groups, are
electric GEM carts (which I drive daily and love) and small trucks (toyota)
and vans (various makes). The segway fills in as a communal use light duty
transport. Its strength is that its maneuverable, fairly fast, easy to use
and just plain fun. The maint cost has been far lower then the Gem carts and
the trucks etc. And its a blast to ride. Ours is the off road version, as we
have some folks that are big and tall!!!!
In our setting, a campus, the Segway is a perfect fit!!!!!!!!!

Here is a web site from a guy that built his own segway clone:

He gives pretty good detail on it - probably enough to duplicate.

So basically the expensive Segway is replacing a simple bicycle in
functionality at a great increase in cost and a reduction in exercise.
Sounds like a wonderful innovation. It of course wouldn't be trendy, but
perhaps you should investigate the pedal tricycles I've seen used in
many large factories. They are low cost, low maintenance, &quot;green&quot;, give
modest exercise and have nice sized cargo baskets that easily carry most
tools.

There are stairs in the factory test track but only the craziest
engineers ride on them. The fixed-handle model has a powered stairway
assist mode that lets you climb stairs dismounted, like pushing a reel-

This is a great thing for the human spirit. Security guards *need* things
like racing Segways and climbing stairs with them on off hours. It's their
little version of hitting golfballs on the moon.

The GEM carts are fun to drive, but they are really junk. We have a dead one
in the garage that I'm tempted to hoist on top of a conex, since the POS

They have 4 wheel versions that are nice.  I want one of those.

Something like a 4-wheeler used in forest and ranch/farm/hunting...

I'd love one to fetch the mail.  That is 400 feet from the house.

Pete, the bike thing has been tried time and time again. It doesn't work.
But what does work is the fact most of the students and staff ride some sort
of thing in from the parking lots, early in the mornings. Some skateboards,
some push scooters, some bikes....etc...

Now I don't know if you have ever lived in phoenix AZ, but it gets bloody
hot here, so getting from air conditioned building to air conditioned
building, without working up such a sweat that no one would like to be in
the same room with you , is not easy. Thus the segway.
Or the gem carts if you have to move tools and supplies around (I keep about
350 pounds of stuff in the locked cabinet on the back of my Gem) The Segway
and or Gems, get us from point A to point B quickly, reliability, safely and
they are fun. So, Bottom line is that trendy does not enter into it. and I
don't appreciate that comment or the tone of your other comments... Have a
nice day......

I'm in Texas, and it gets hot here too, perhaps with a little more

Trendy sure does enter into it, the trend away from routine exercise
which is a big contributor to the obesity issues in the US. If the trend
keeps up we'll end up a country of &quot;power chair&quot; users who can barely
get on and off the dang things. Considering how recent the Segway is,
they sure aren't essential and people have survived the conditions you
