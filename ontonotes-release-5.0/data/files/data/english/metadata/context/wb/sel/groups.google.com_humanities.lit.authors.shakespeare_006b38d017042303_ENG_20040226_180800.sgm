Prosopopoeia, n. [Etymology: Latin, from Greek prosOpopoiia, from
prosOpon MASK, person (from pros- + Ops face) + poiein to make c 1555]

A figure by which an absent person is introduced as speaking.

Garber, Marjorie. &quot;Hamlet: Giving Up the Ghost.&quot;

&lt;&lt;prosopopoeia as the &quot;fiction of the voice from-beyond-the-grave.&quot;

Prosopopoeia is the trope of autobiography, by which one's name, as
in the Milton poem, is made as intelligible and memorable as a face.&gt;&gt;

Others say the Triple Tau is originally
the coming together of a T &amp; H, meaning

[T]emplum [H]ierosolyma

Christians interpreted the symbol as &quot;Holiness supporting Trinity&quot;.
Royal Arch records dating from 1767 show this symbol.

_Marbles_ by Dagonell the Juggler

&lt;&lt;Marbles predate recorded history. Not only have marbles been found in
Egyptian tombs as well as Greek and Roman excavations, but also in
archaeological digs dating back to the Ice Age on every continent. The
Roman poet Ovid mentions marbles. Pieter Bruegel, a 16th century Flemish
painter, depicts children playing marbles in &quot;Children's Games&quot; (1559):

&quot;a game of marbles not unlike our common taw.&quot;

&lt;&lt;RING TAW This is one of the best known and most popular of all marble
games for a group of players. As with 'INCREASE POUND', two circles are
drawn on the ground. The inner circle should be about 1' (30cms) in
diameter, the outer should be about 7' (2m) diameter. Each player puts
an agreed number of marbles into the inner ring. The order of play is
decided and the players take turns to shoot their TAW from any point on
the outer ring, at the marbles in the center. Any marbles knocked out of
the center ring are pocketed by the shooter and he is entitled to shoot
again from the spot where his TAW lies. When a shot is unsuccessful play
passes to the next player and the TAW remains on the ground where it
comes to rest, if that spot is within the outer ring. The next player
may then shoot at the marbles in the center or at any of his opponents
TAWS. If he strikes a TAW, the owner of that TAW has to pay him one
marble and he takes another shot. The shooter may not strike the same
opponents TAW twice in succession. The game continues until the ring is
cleared.&gt;&gt;

Shakespeare mentions the game of Cherry Pit in which polished stones
were tossed into holes in the ground, and in Henry V he talks of
times when &quot;the boys went to span-counter for French Crowns.&quot;

CHERRY PIT -- This is the reverse of RING TAW. A one-foot wide hole is
dug in the center of a ten-foot circle. Each player places a number of
marbles around the hole so that there is about a dozen marbles
surrounding the hole. Players take turns trying to knock marbles into
the hole. Like Ring Taw, as long as marbles are knocked into the hole
and the taw remains in the ring, players may continue to shoot. If a taw
goes into the hole, the owner must forfeit a number of marbles and place
them around the hole to 'buy back' his shooter.

SIR TOBY BELCH: What, man! 'tis not for

&lt;&lt;Whenever a town was founded a round hole would first be dug.
In the bottom of it a stone, LAPIS manalis, which represented
a gate to the Underworld, would then be embedded.

On August 23rd,
this stone would be removed to permit the Manes to pass through.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; According to several unattributed accounts, the suitors of Penelope
are said to have rolled marbles for her hand in Ithaca while Odysseus
was wandering among the Lotus Eaters; and marble enthusiasts say what
David smot Goliath with was the truest of his collection of marbles. In
Games and Songs of American Children, which were &quot;collected and
compared&quot; by William Wells Newel in 1883, the game of marbles is traced
to Rome. Mr. Newel wrote: The first of these games may be descended from
a sport of Roman children, mentioned by Ovid, and still in existence in
which nuts are rolled down an inclined plane, with the object of
striking the nut of the adversary. The second seems to be the childish
reduction of a game with the ball, similar to &quot;Golf.&quot; The Latin
expression relinquere nuces -- putting away childish things -- probably
refers to that form of marbles played with polished nuts. And in The
Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, published in 1898, Joseph
Strutt wrote, &quot;It is said of Augustus when young that by the way of
amusement he spent many hours in playing with little Moorish boys cum
nucibus [with nuts].&quot; Strutt also opines &quot;marbles seem to have been used
by the boys as substitues for bowls, and with them they amuse themselves
in many different manners. I believe nuts, round stones, or any other
small things that could be easily bowled along, were used as marbles.
Those played with now seem to be of more modern invention.&quot;

Beaumont and Fletcher in Monsieur Thomas, Dekker and Webseter in
Northward Ho, and John Donne in his fourth Satire all mention marbles
games. And Richard Addison in one of his 1700 Tatler papers refers to &quot;a
game of marbles not unlike our common taw.&quot; Strutt describes Taw as a
game in which players put marbles into a ring and attempt to shoot them
out &quot;and he who obtains the most of them by beating them out of the ring
is the conqueror.&quot; Taw was and is a community sport in many parts of
England. In the Sussex village of Tinsley Green, for example, marbles,
as an organized championship-style event has existed since Elizabethan
times, and the village team (none of whose members is younger than 50)
annually sends out blanket challenges to any team foolhardy enough to
compete with them. Two hundred-year-old clay marbles are preserved by
the village for its tourneys.

Good Friday in England was once celebrated as &quot;Marbles Day,&quot; a
defensive ploy by the English clergy who considered a countrywide
marbles day preferable to &quot;moree boisterous and mischievous enjoyments.&quot;
Pubs and inns and taverns had built-in marbles &quot;bowling alleys&quot; for
their patrons' pleasure. But there was a measure of British restraint.
For university students there was no marbles playing permitted at the
portals of Oxford Library; nor by law were marbles games tolerated in
the Great Hall at Westminster.

Marbles games fall generally into three categories: chase games in
which two or more players alternately shoot at each other along a
makeshift meandoring course; enclosure games in which marbles are shot
at other marbles contained within a marked- off area; and hole games in
which marbles are shot or bowled into a successive series of holes.

George Washington was a marbles player, as were Thomas Jefferson and
John Quincy Adams, and we're told that Abraham Lincoln, when he reached
the age
of majority and moved out of his parents' home in New Salem, became a
marbles-playing terror, his specialty being Old Bowler.

A fifteenth century manuscript mentions &quot;the little yellow balls with
which school boys played, and which were very cheap.&quot; Some sources claim
that glass marbles had their origin in Venice with the old glassmakers.
These were supposedly called monstrosities by the English who did not
feel they were sturdy enough for their games. Daniel Defoe, author of
&quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; wrote in 1720 that:

Marbles, which he used to call children's playing at bowls, yeilded
him a mighty diversion, and he was so dextrous an artist at shooting
that little alabaster globe from between the end of his forefinger and
knuckle of his thumb that he seldom missed hitting plumb, as the boys
called it, the marble aimed at, though at a distance of two or three
yards.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In the ancient world Roman children were not the only children
to play games with marbles. However, it is not known what these
games may have been. The oldest marbles that have been found
date to 3000 BC. They were a group of rounded semi-precious
stones that were buried with an Egyptian Child at Nagada.
The British Museum has marbles from Crete that date to 2000
- 1700 BC. They were found at the Minoan site of Petsofa.
In North America engraved marbles have been found in
ancient Native American earthen mounds (Britannica).

Now in discovering where our modern names for 'marbles' originate
from is of historical interest to the marble collector. The
French the word for toy marble is 'bille' which means 'little ball'.
The word 'bille' appears as early as the 12th century (Dauzat's
Etymological Dictionary). The Dutch word for marbles is
'knikkers'. Children in New York used the term 'knikkers'
straight into the 19th century (Gartley and Carskadden). The word
knikker bakker originally referred to a Dutch ceramic marble
maker (marble baker). It is from the Greeks that we get the word
'marmaros'. However, the word 'marbles' was not used in
England until 1694. It was not until toy marbles were fashioned
from marble stone and imported from Germany does the term
'marbles' appear (Gartley and Carskadden). Before that time the
English word for marbles was either 'bowls' or 'knickers'
(Oxford's English Dictionary).

Like with Roman Children the game of marbles was a popular
past time with European children of the 16th through the 20th
centuries. The (1560) painting by Peter Brueghel depicts children
playing marbles. Many other paintings and engravings depict this
popular past time. There is an engraving by Jacob von der
Heyden (1632), a painting by Hermann Saftleven (1634),
and a painting by Cats (1622) to name just a few.

There are nine marble games that can be found on 17th and 18th
century Dutch wall tiles (Gartley and Carskadden ). They include
the Roman game of 'nuts', nine holes, pyramid, line shooting,
(schreefje shieten ), stuiken, ring taw, baggora, five stones
and rolduitje.

A collection of ancient toy marbles can be found in the British
Museum, on exhibition in Room 69, case 9. The grayish-white
stone marble is Roman and was found at Carthage. The Roman
glass marbles were all found in Egypt. The three smaller ones
were found from the site of Oxyrhyncus.
---------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Marbles have an extremely old origin and represent one of the earliest
games ever played. Earthen monuments of the Mound Builders, a race of
people who lived on the American continent before the Indians arrived,
contained marbles along with the other ancient artifacts. These early
marbles were of both flint and clay and had often been decorated by
their makers. Of course they were crude in form, since the tools by
which they were formed were crude also. Whether these first spheres
were used in a game or whether they had some religious, ceremonial,
or decorative purpose is not known....

Two thousand years ago the literature of the Greeks and Romans recorded
their use of marbles. excavations back at least fifty centuries have
yielded the early marbles written about. They were also crudely made and
were formed of stone. Egyptian children also seemed to have played with
marbles, as some of these spheres have been found in the ruins of that
culture. The British Museum contains marbles used by both
the Egyptian and Roman children.

In the Roman Empire marbles seem to have reached a peak of popularity
about the time of the Emperor Augustus, a century before the beginning
of the Christian era. There are frequent references to the use of
marbles in various games and sports in Roman literature of this period.
By the Romans, the game probably was spread throughout their empire to
all of the areas conquered by them. In this way, the game appeared in
England about the latter part of the first century A.D., after the final
conquest of Britain by the Romans. About this period, the writings of
Britain reveal that both the grownups and the children used marbles made
from stone in their games. As marbles became more popular in Britain,

In the United States the varities of marbles are vitrually infinite and
the game is called variously, Ringer or Immies or Mibs or simply
Marbles. In England and in Scotland and Ireland it is Taw or Boss or
Span. In Brazil children play it as Gude; in parts of Africa it is
Jorrah and in Italy, Pallina di vetro. In West Virginia it's played with
agate or glass balls. It has been played in Australia with balls of
polished wood and on the street of New York City with steel ball
bearings. In Iran, Turkey and Syria it's played with balls of baked clay
or with the knucklebones of sheep. Chinese children play at &quot;kicking the
marbles&quot; and kids in Tasmania play at Pyramids.

It has been played with vigor and often excessive dedication by
emperors and by overalled kids on farms shooting clay pedabs; by
presidents and by city kids shredding their corduroy knickers as they
hunkered down on cement sidewalks. It is believed to have spawned
bagatelle and the pinball machine, bowling, billiards, golf,
Chinese checkers and Pachinko.

It is an ancient game; the guess is prehistoric. Exactly where and when
marbles began is not known, and the literature of marbles is skimpy and
imprecise, but there do exist archaeological and literary beacons which
surface from time to time and tell us something of its origins and of
its historical course. Archaeologists have dug up small balls of clay,
flint and stone in caves in Europe and in the tombs of Egyptian
pharoahs. Marbles have been discovered in the digs of the Mound Builder
Indians of Mississippi, and we are told that the Aztecs played a form of
marbles. Pre-Christian terra cottas and other statuary often depict
children playing at knucklebones and astragals, which are thought to be
forerunners of marbles games. Those who have studied the beginnings of
various games say that generally games began in the lower valleys of the
Nile, Tigris and Euphrates rivers, spread to Africa and to Greece,
thence to Sicily and to Rome, and with the Roman legions to Britain and
the norhtern European regions and to the Germanic tribes. From Britain
the movement of games coincided with the spread of empire.

Marbles was known throughout Europe in pre-Elizabethan times. In 1503
the town council of Nuremberg limited the playing of marbles games to a
meadow outside of the town's limits; and in the English village of St.
Gall, the town council statutes authorized the sacristan of St. Laurence
to use a cat-o'-nine tails on boys &quot;who played at marbles under
the fish stand and refused to be warned off.&quot; In France the game of
Troule-en-Madame in which small marbles were rolled into holes at one
end of a board was popular, and it moved across the English Channel to
be corrupted into the children's marbles game called Troll-My-Dame.&gt;&gt;

Shakespeare's Lost Sonnets: A Restoration of the Runes
by Roy Neil Graves, Professor of English
The University of Tennessee at Martin

&lt;&lt;Eyecatching, too, is the empaneled vertical acrostic string TAWS
(Sonnet 45 down): The verb &quot;taw&quot; (OEff.) meant &quot;to soften leather&quot; and,
figuratively, &quot;to flog,&quot; and the rare noun &quot;taw&quot; (1562) denoted prepared
leather. Since Will's father John was a glover and whitawer, a curer of
glove skins (Harrison 8), TAWS seems almost as crafty as the AVON
string. Because the Greek &quot;Tau&quot; was a cross-shaped &quot;T&quot;-a St. Anthony's
Cross and sacred symbol in the Middle Ages (OED)-the string gains
further relevance in an &quot;acrostic&quot; setting, encouraging the reading
of the vertical acrostic codeline of which TAWS is a part.&gt;&gt;

&quot;When HEMPE is ripe and ready to pull,
Then Englishman beware thy skull.&quot;

&lt;&lt;This prophecy, which, one would think, ought to have put him in
mind of the gallows, the not unusual fate of false prophets, and
perchance his own, he explains thus: -- &quot;In this word HEMPE be five
letters. Now, by reckoning the five successive princes from Henry
VIII, this prophecy is easily explained: H signifieth King Henry
before named; E, Edward, his son, the sixth of that name; M, Mary,
who succeeded him; P, Philip of Spain, who, by marrying Queen Mary,
participated with her in the English diadem; and, lastly, E signifieth
Queen Elizabeth, after whose death there was a great feare that some
troubles might have arisen about the crown.&quot; As this did not happen,
Heywood,. who was a sly rogue in a small way, gets out of the scrape
by saying, &quot;Yet proved this augury true, though not according to the
former expectation; for, after the peaceful inauguration of King
James, there was great mortality, not in London only, but through
the whole kingdom, and from which the nation was not quite clean

like a GALLOWS. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at
the time, but I could not help staring at this GALLOWS with a vague
misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two

SIR WALTER RALEIGH (Ralegh)

&lt;&lt;Raleigh's health began to fail through long imprisonment
and sadness at the death - typhoid - in 1612 of Prince Henry,
his patron and admirer. With him died Raleigh's hope of release.
Fortunately, the lure of gold was so great that in 1616, James I freed
Raleigh and sent him to South America with two ships which the king
expected to have returned to him, filled with gold. WAT went too, hoping
to make a name for himself. Sir Walter became ill on the voyage and was
left behind in Trinidad while son WAT continued on up the ORINOCO River.

King James had made it clear that they were not to bother the Spanish.
Unfortunately, WAT didn't heed the warnings,
attacked a Spanish settlement and was killed.

Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673)
THE HUNTING OF THE HARE

Betwixt two ridges of ploughed land lay [WAT]
Pressing his body close to earth lay squat
His nose upon his two forefeet close lies
Glaring obliquely with his great grey eyes
His head he always sets against the wind
If turn his tail, his hairs blow up behind,

[W]hich he too cold will grow; but he is wise,
[A]nd keeps his coat still down, so warm he lies.
[T]hus resting all the day, till sun doth set,

Then riseth up, his relief for to get,
Walking about until the sun doth rise;
Then back returns, down in his form he lies.
At last poor [WAT] was found as he there lay,
By huntsmen with their dogs which came that way.
Seeing, get up and fast begins to run,
Hoping some ways the cruel dogs to shun.
But they by nature have so quick a scent
That by their nose they trace what way he went.

Into a great thick wood he straightway gets
Where underneath a broken bough he sits
At every leaf what with the wind did shake
Did bring such terror, made his heart to ache.
That place he left; to champian plains he went,
Winding about for to deceive their scent,
And while they snuffling were to find his track
Poor [WAT], being weary, his swift pace did slack .

. The great slow hounds, their throats did set a base
The fleet swift hounds as tenors next in place;

[T]he little beagles, they a treble sing.
[A]nd through the air their voice a round did ring;
[W]hich made a consort as they ran along:

If they but words could speak, might sing a song:
The horns kept time, the hunters shout for joy
And valiant seem, poor [WAT] for to destroy.
Spurring their horses to a full career,
Swim rivers deep, leap ditches without fear;
Endanger life and limbs, so fast will ride,
Only to see how patiently [WAT] died.
For why, the dogs so near his heels did get
That they their sharp teeth in his breech did set.
Then tumbling down, did fall with weeping eyes,
Gives up his ghost, and thus poor [WAT] he dies.

[W]hilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
[A]t the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
[T]o be so tickled they would change their state

144

[T]empteth my better angel from my side,
[A]nd would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
[W]ooing his purity with her foul pride.

[T]o make me give the lie to my TRUE sight,
[A]nd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
[W]hence hast thou this becoming of things ill,

Ignatius of Antioch
Feastday: October 17 (formerly on February 1)

&lt;&lt;During Trajan's persecutions, Ignatius was seized by a guard of ten
soldiers, bound, and taken to Rome by them. The soldiers boarded a ship
that traveled along the southern and western shores of Asia Minor
instead of going straight to Italy. Ignatius was greeted by crowds of
Christians wherever the ship touched port, but he was ill-treated by
his captors. At Lystra, before crossing into Europe, he wrote three
more [letters], to the Christians at Philadelphia and Smyrna.
(The letters can be found in short and long versions at:

Courteous Reader_,

I might in this place at tempt to gain thy Favour, by declaring that I
write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick Good; but
in this I should not be sincere; and Men are now a-days too wise to be
deceiv'd by Pretences how specious soever. The plain Truth of the Matter
is, I am excessive poor, and my Wife, good Woman, is, I tell her,
excessive proud; she cannot bear, she says, to sit spinning in her Shift
of TOW, while I do nothing but gaze at the Stars; and has threatned
more than once to burn all my Books and Rattling-Traps (as she calls my
Instruments) if I do not make some profitable Use of them for the good
of my Family. The Printer has offer'd me some considerable share of the
Profits, and I have thus begun to comply with my Dame's desire. Indeed
this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me publish an
Almanack many Years since, had it not been overpower'd by my Regard for
my good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. _Titan Leeds_, whose Interest
I was extreamly unwilling to hurt: But this Obstacle (I am far from
speaking it with Pleasure) is soon to be removed, since inexorable
Death, who was never known to respect Merit, has already prepared the
mortal Dart, the fatal Sister has already extended her destroying
Shears, and that ingenious Man must soon be taken from us.

He dies, by my Calculation made at his Request,
on _Oct._ 17. 1733. 3 ho. 29 m. _P.M._ at the very instant of
the xxx of xxx and xxx: By his own Calculation he will survive till
the 26th of the same Month. This small difference between us we have
disputed whenever we have met these 9 Years past; but at length he is
inclinable to agree with my Judgment; Which of us is most exact, a
little Time will now determine. As therefore these Provinces may not
longer expect to see any of his Performances after this Year, I think
my self free to take up the Task, and request a share of the publick
Encouragement; which I am the more apt to hope for on this Account,
that the Buyer of my Almanack may consider himself,
not only as purchasing an useful Utensil, but as performing
an Act of Charity, to his poor _Friend and Servant_
_R. SAUNDERS._
