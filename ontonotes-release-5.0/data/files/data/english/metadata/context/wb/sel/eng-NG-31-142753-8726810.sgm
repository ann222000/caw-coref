·      We cannot do this all at once. It takes time. You have to grow into
it. Gradually, day after day and year after year, give more and more
of your life and love to God. As you do this, your karmic burden is
lifted.
·      The guru gives unconditional love no matter what we do. Day after
day and year after year, we see how he watches over us, never losing
sight of us. As our ability to see this increases, our faith
correspondingly grows.
·      Now, meditate for a few minutes and picture the guru in your
spiritual eye.

Bringing the Power of Joy Into Our Lives
Brother Achilananda

·      From Daya Mata: Dear ones: A warm welcome to all who come to immerse
in God's presence. I wish I could be there. But be sure to know you
are in my thoughts and prayers. Guruji was thrilled when devotees
would come to convocation with the single minded purpose of communion
with God. Make the most of this opportunity. Leave behind the concerns
that would otherwise pull you in many directions. Listen and open to
the wisdom before you and see how it applies to your life. Walk with
guruji this week and let his Divine Love and peace permeate your soul.
His greatest desire is to draw souls to God. You have his unceasing
blessings. (There was much more but I couldn't keep up with the pace
of Brother's reading.)
·      Convocation can be a life changing experience, especially if it is
your first time. It certainly was for Brother Achilananda. He arrived
a little late, just as everyone was standing for the opening prayer
with hands folded. He thought, &quot;Man this is weird.&quot; He was skeptical
at first but before long he thought, &quot;I am home. Thank God I am home
at last.&quot; And this thought has never left.
·      He tried energization, which helped a physical problem. The rest of
what he learned early on helped his body, mind, and soul. Then he met
a renunciate and found out what that is. He thought he wanted that but
felt he should cool it by practicing for 3 years before committing. It
took 9 months. He entered in l955. It was the best decision he had
made to that point and since.
·      There are many tests which breed understanding which breeds service
and service fills our cup with joy That is the law so you too can have
that joy by spiritualizing your life. The more joy you give, the more
joy comes to you.
·      A strong determination to be happy will help you. Happiness to some
extent is conditional but mostly it depends on attitude and character.
Happiness comes not so much from what we have but who we are.
·      Why is the 7th Harry Potter book so popular? The author knows how to
tell a story. There is a fascinating drama unlike our ordinary world
yet the characters share our emotions. Is God less an author? We need
to learn to enjoy the drama as though it belongs to someone else.
There are twists, unexpected turns, humor, sadness, failure,
accomplishment, etc. Learn from it. Whatever comes, take as a movie.
Laugh. Laughter is a remedy for human ills.
·      Finding God is the funeral of all our sorrows. Be mentally above
every crucifixion. Go out of your way to make others happy. Give
loving-kindness. Smile radiantly from a joyous heart. Sadness is
offensive to Spirit.
