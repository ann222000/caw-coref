Pelosi went with CONdumbs who chose to put country ahead of Bush
WANTS. But Bush's ill informed desires placed a cast of gray over the

According to a friend who lives near Reno, Reid won't be around to
swindle the public after his next campaign. They are fed up with his
wheeling and dealing.

Cheech and lew, are you guys in a contest to be the last Bush
supporters trying desperately to convey any logic or rationale to the
Bush attacks on the Constitution and misuse (and abuse) of the US
military? Whoever wins, please turn out the lights on one of the
darkest chapters of US presidential history. This Great Pretender
should resign in shame but he is without honor or conscience and is
forcing the American people to turn to impeachment to restore the
checks and balances that have served us so well for 218 years.

sacks of scum that now occupy the White House...it's your no cajones

BIFF -

Every U.S. soldier in Iraq:

1. Is an ADULT.

2. VOLUNTEERED to enlist in the military.  Most have enlisted and/or
re-enlisted since the Iraq War began   and have considered the
consequences of putting their lives at risk for this cause.

3. Is TRAINED to fight in wars.

4. Usually will RE-ENLIST. RE-ENLISTMENT rates for units serving in
Iraq are extremely HIGH much higher than in the United States. These
people know their mission and believe in their mission or they would
not re-enlist. Many have volunteered to return to Iran one, two, or
three more times.

mike, how the us military is used (or misused and horrendously
depleted in Bush's case) is a matter of public policy, as such it is
subject to the scrutiny of US citizens. Whether it is volunteer or not
for the most part is irrelevant.

WHAT they volunteered for is part of the analysis. No troops
VOLUNTEERED to help Bush win election with an invasion to end an
IMAGINARY threat. Our troops reenlist because they are Americans with
loyalty to the US, and a sense of duty. These qualities are lacking in

what amazes me is how someone who claims to support the troops with
one breath can claim they are only volunteers with the next and
shouldn't mater .
&quot; Every U.S. soldier in Iraq: 1. Is an ADULT. 2. VOLUNTEERED to enlist
in the military.  Most have enlisted and/or re-enlisted since the Iraq
War began   and have considered the consequences of putting their
lives at risk for this cause. &quot;
talk about being a phony wow !

Lew, that is the same condition of denial that got us into this mess
in the first place:

Is US Army bent to the breaking point?
If retention rates of US military personnel begin to weaken, it could
take years to reverse the trend.
By Gordon Lubold | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor

from the April 4, 2007 edition

husband, who leads the 25th Infantry Division Band, will be staying in
Iraq longer.

Washington - When some 4,500 soldiers heard over the weekend that
they'd be deploying to Iraq earlier than expected, many saw it as yet
another inconvenience that military personnel must endure. But to some
in Washington, the announcement is a glaring sign that the Army really
is straining and that its well of rested, trained, and equipped
soldiers is running dry.

The Pentagon's announcement Monday that it is sending two units back
to Iraq early means it will renege on its objective to give soldiers
at least 12 months at home between deployments. While the Defense
Department has extended the deployment of troops in combat, this is
only the second time it has had to deprive soldiers from a major unit
of a year-long rest.

The fact that the Pentagon felt compelled to make the call-up seems to
validate what many retired generals and former Pentagon officials have
warned: that repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are wearing
out military personnel and equipment to a worrisome point.

&quot;We're running out of Army units for the mission,&quot; says Robert Scales,
a retired Army two-star general.

The Army is about to be &quot;broken,&quot; he says. What would be the &quot;canary
in the mine&quot; is if junior officers and mid-grade enlisted soldiers
become so frustrated with the repeated deployments that they simply
get out. Pentagon officials maintain that the retention rates of
military personnel remain strong, but if they begin to weaken, it
could take years to reverse the trend.

If a seasoned Army sergeant decides to get out because he is tired of
all the deployments, it can be very difficult to replace him, says one
former Pentagon official.

&quot;It's very hard. A 15-year sergeant takes 15 years to grow,&quot; says
Bernard Rostker, a former Pentagon personnel chief under President
Clinton and an author of a book about the all-volunteer military
force. &quot;Personnel systems can be very unforgiving.&quot; .....

WHAT A BUNCH OF &quot;HATE USA - HATE BUSH&quot;  BALONEY.

You mean in WWII we should have surrendered to Germany or Japan
because many of our service people fought for 3 years from battle to
battle with never a leave home?

Was our military &quot;broken&quot; then when the tough going was non-ending?

Your motto:

&quot;Broken military?  Then quit/surrender.&quot;

The high re-enlisment rate of the military does not bring out whatever
your point is.

I'll bet you criticize the newly developing Iraqi military for its
ineffectiveness.

But yet you cite that it take 15 years to develop effective U.S.
NCO's.  The Iraqi military has only had 2-3 tears to develop those
NCO's which it takes the U.S. military 15 years to fevelop.

In WWII, we have many NCO's who were developed in about 6 months. - In
fact, probably most of the NCO's were developed in about 76 months.

Starting with Brent Scowcroft, Zinni, Shinseki, Batiste,and many more
US brass, critical of the Iraq invasion you in your infinite wisdom
are of course right lew. Maybe Bush will call you so we can finally
get some people over there to appropriately kick butt. Should we just
call you George (Patton) rather than Lew?

There are plenty of conservative thinkers out there predicting
accurately since 2002 what a wrong road Bush and his bunch of arrogant
morons put us on, but you will likely still be rationalizing this
idiocy 10 years from now.  Don't read any history books Lew, you might
ruin your perfect record of never being right.

&gt; I'll bet you criticize the newly developing Iraqi military for its

&gt; But yet you cite that it take 15 years to develop effective U.S.
&gt; NCO's.  The Iraqi military has only had 2-3 tears to develop those
&gt; NCO's which it takes the U.S. military 15 years to fevelop.

&gt; In WWII, we have many NCO's who were developed in about 6 months. - In

&gt; &gt; Is US Army bent to the breaking point?
&gt; &gt; If retention rates of US military personnel begin to weaken, it could
&gt; &gt; take years to reverse the trend.

&gt; &gt; husband, who leads the 25th Infantry Division Band, will be staying in
&gt; &gt; Iraq longer.

&gt; &gt; Washington - When some 4,500 soldiers heard over the weekend that
&gt; &gt; they'd be deploying to Iraq earlier than expected, many saw it as yet
&gt; &gt; another inconvenience that military personnel must endure. But to some
&gt; &gt; in Washington, the announcement is a glaring sign that the Army really
&gt; &gt; is straining and that its well of rested, trained, and equipped
&gt; &gt; soldiers is running dry.

&gt; &gt; The Pentagon's announcement Monday that it is sending two units back
&gt; &gt; to Iraq early means it will renege on its objective to give soldiers
&gt; &gt; at least 12 months at home between deployments. While the Defense
&gt; &gt; Department has extended the deployment of troops in combat, this is
&gt; &gt; only the second time it has had to deprive soldiers from a major unit
&gt; &gt; of a year-long rest.

&gt; &gt; The fact that the Pentagon felt compelled to make the call-up seems to
&gt; &gt; validate what many retired generals and former Pentagon officials have
&gt; &gt; warned: that repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are wearing
&gt; &gt; out military personnel and equipment to a worrisome point.

&gt; &gt; &quot;We're running out of Army units for the mission,&quot; says Robert Scales,
&gt; &gt; a retired Army two-star general.

&gt; &gt; The Army is about to be &quot;broken,&quot; he says. What would be the &quot;canary
&gt; &gt; in the mine&quot; is if junior officers and mid-grade enlisted soldiers
&gt; &gt; become so frustrated with the repeated deployments that they simply
&gt; &gt; get out. Pentagon officials maintain that the retention rates of
&gt; &gt; military personnel remain strong, but if they begin to weaken, it
&gt; &gt; could take years to reverse the trend.

&gt; &gt; If a seasoned Army sergeant decides to get out because he is tired of
&gt; &gt; all the deployments, it can be very difficult to replace him, says one
&gt; &gt; former Pentagon official.

&gt; &gt; &quot;It's very hard. A 15-year sergeant takes 15 years to grow,&quot; says
&gt; &gt; Bernard Rostker, a former Pentagon personnel chief under President
&gt; &gt; Clinton and an author of a book about the all-volunteer military
&gt; &gt; force. &quot;Personnel systems can be very unforgiving.&quot; .....

the bunch of arrogant morons you refer to who enforced the Iraq Cease
Fire from the 1991 Gulf War so kindly ignored by that friendly
dictator, Saddam Hussein, - may soon achieve victory in Iraq and a
major turning point in the War on Terror as Democracy may soon succeed
in Iraq..  It looks like the worm is beginning to turn.

No matter how many insults thrown at Bush, he may succeed and
Ddemocrats may have to learn to live with this success instead of the
disimal failure they are trying so hard to bring about.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they'd be deploying to Iraq earlier than expected, many saw it as yet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another inconvenience that military personnel must endure. But to some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Washington, the announcement is a glaring sign that the Army really
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is straining and that its well of rested, trained, and equipped
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers is running dry.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Pentagon's announcement Monday that it is sending two units back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Iraq early means it will renege on its objective to give soldiers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least 12 months at home between deployments. While the Defense
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Department has extended the deployment of troops in combat, this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only the second time it has had to deprive soldiers from a major unit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a year-long rest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that the Pentagon felt compelled to make the call-up seems to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; validate what many retired generals and former Pentagon officials have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warned: that repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are wearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out military personnel and equipment to a worrisome point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We're running out of Army units for the mission,&quot; says Robert Scales,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a retired Army two-star general.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Army is about to be &quot;broken,&quot; he says. What would be the &quot;canary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mine&quot; is if junior officers and mid-grade enlisted soldiers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become so frustrated with the repeated deployments that they simply
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get out. Pentagon officials maintain that the retention rates of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military personnel remain strong, but if they begin to weaken, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could take years to reverse the trend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a seasoned Army sergeant decides to get out because he is tired of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the deployments, it can be very difficult to replace him, says one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; former Pentagon official.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It's very hard. A 15-year sergeant takes 15 years to grow,&quot; says
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bernard Rostker, a former Pentagon personnel chief under President
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Clinton and an author of a book about the all-volunteer military
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force. &quot;Personnel systems can be very unforgiving.&quot; .....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The hyman element of the U.S. military is not being mis-used or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depleted as you seem to think.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mike, how the us military is used (or misused and horrendously
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depleted in Bush's case) is a matter of public policy, as such it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject to the scrutiny of US citizens. Whether it is volunteer or not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the most part is irrelevant.
