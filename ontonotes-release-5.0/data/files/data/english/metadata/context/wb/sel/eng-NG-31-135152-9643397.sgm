Apologies if this covered in a FAQ (I didn't see it).

I've seen numerous references in the group to washing Mobos. How does
one go about that?Dishwasher?  Has anyone ever ruined a Mobo doing
this?

I recently discussed board cleaning on 68kMLA:

http://68kmla.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=31812&amp;sid;=99717ddb00c84d8cd8...

I've never had the guts to try washing it in water, despite many
reports of success doing such.  I prefer Ethanol because it dries up
in seconds, allowing me to test the board mere seconds after
cleaning.  Even if the washing machine method words, the fact remains
that you have to wait a long time for the board to fully dry.

Boards get subjected to much higher temperatures
during manufacture, then they get washed with solvents
or soap and water to remove soldering flux.

So no, a trip through the dishwasher isn't going to
hurt a circuit board- as long as you DO NOT run it
through the dry cycle. Remove the board after the
rinse cycle and shake off as much water as you can,
then set it in front of a heat vent to dry. Ideally
you should use compressed air to blow underneath
components but warm air from your furnace works OK.
Setting it out in the sun will work even better, but
there's rather a lack of warm, sunny spots in the N.
Hemisphere in winter. ;)

Let the board dry for at least a day before
reinstalling it.

If you've seen &quot;Top rack dishwasher safe&quot; on stuff,
what that means is it won't melt in the heated dry
cycle in the top rack because it's far enough away
from the radiant heating element. You can wash it in
the bottom rack as long as you set it to not dry.

P.S. You can do other weird stuff with a dishwasher
like blanching corn and other vegetables, as long as
the rinse aid dispenser is empty. I don't think Jet
Dry would go too well with corn on the cob. ;) Don't
run your corn through the dry cycle. Dishwashers make
poor barbecue grills.

I think i'm with others who can't get past the thought of drenching the
mobo lol. But, it's one of those tricks wacky enough that it just defies
thought until someone says it!
I'm going to try it today, with my still non running Mac512K keyboard
circuit and parts. Could be metal shavings or something that may be
loosened. Also because we fittingly just ran out of dishwasher detergent.

Of almost related interest and sorry if i'm side stepping, but why does
WD-40 ruin a circuit board ? I made the mistake of spraying some on a
board one time and it came up looking great. Carefully cleaned off any
residues. Left it a week to dry and then plugged it in, it fried itself.

WD-40 is a solvent with some kind of oils. Solvent evaporates and
leaves the oils around that could be conductive enough to short
something out.

&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WD-40 &gt;

WD-40 is commonly used on electric switchgear without problems. Whether it does any good other than lubrication of moving parts is not clear.

Greg's note is pretty much the whole story about washing. He's right that the boards are washed in a dishwasher-like process as they are made. Modern surface mount fluxes are a bit acidic as are the leaks from aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Hot water is best for removing the acids but it can leave its own residues. Distilled water and deionized water are sometimes used for final rinses. Dry alcohol, ethanol or isopropanol, can be used to dry up remaining water on a washed board but rubbing alcohol is wet and won't work. Waiting a day or so probably does as well. Rosin solder flux used for repair is best cleaned with alcohol. Water doesn't cut it.

The entire board is heated to well over the boiling point of water for the soldering process. Some parts may be added after the soldering operation and might contain plastics that are not made for solder temperatures. That's the reason for keeping away from a dry cycle on a washing machine.

Oil does not conduct electricity... You could put the entire board in
oil (motor oil, vegetable oil, transformer oil, take your pick... I
wouldn't use vegetable oil for anything long term though, it tends to
smell after a while) and run the board totally submerged

&gt;&gt;WD-40 is a solvent with some kind of oils.&lt;&lt;

WD-40 is neither a solvent nor is it a lubricant.  It was formulated to remove
water - WD = Water Displacement.  40 = the 40th attempt to come up with
something that would do this.

WD-40 dries into a gunk that is hard to dissolve, remove, what have you.
Granted, it isn't conductive, but it is sticky gunk at the end of its drying cycle.

Another good reason to use alcohol (Ethanol or 90%+ IPA) is it
doesn't tend to oxidize stuff.  If you wash it, even briefly, in
water it can get trapped inside all sorts of parts and sit for some
time, rusting things away.  It needs to be heated to drive out the
water.  And even then it's iffy.

My daughter recently dropped her cell phone in a toilet.  When I took
it apart there was corrosion all over the place.  I actually got it
back to a semi-working condition.  Unfortunately, not a useable
condition.  But I did flush it out with IPA which I'm pretty sure
helped bring it back from dead to semi-working.  If I had gotten it
right away I might have saved it.

I have washed literally hundreds of logic boards, cards, keyboards,
processors, power supply's, ram etc.. I wash them in the sink with a very
mild detergent then rinse well. I remove all the socketed chips on cards and
boards. Electronics will dry quick if you put them outdoors in the sun even
in cool weather if the sun is out.

I too have washed 100's of logic boards, PSUs, even floppy drives,
DAT, 8mm mechanisms... basically, everything I get in, I wash.

I use the laundry room tub with a hose attached to faucet, and hot
water.   I spray a little Simple Green on, say a motherboard, then I
use a fat paint brush to go over part to loosen up dirt, then rinse
with hose.  I put my thumb over hose to get a strong jet of water.
When the board is steaming warm and rinsed, I carefully shake all the
water off it (you have to have a feel for how to properly hold the
board so that when you shake it down, you don't flex it)... then lay
the board down on a towel... flipping it over in about 6 hours.. and
let it dry a good 24hr.

WD40 is highly NOT recommended..as any oil residue will only collect
dirt.   I'd sooner use Pledge than WD-40.

Alchohol is fine when the part is small and you need it quick, but
otherwise, just isn't ideal for part cleaning because you can't spray
it, it's not hot, and it's not cheap.

I use this method on everything.. however, with drive mechanisms,
one has to take a lot more care..   not spraying water into motors,
for example.   Cleaning off the old lube first... Relubing the mechs
correctly afterwards.. etc.

I agree that &quot;electronics will dry quick&quot; when you put them in the sun
on a sunny warm day, especially if its a windy day too.  But the fact
remains that it will not be &quot;in seconds&quot; as it would if you were to
use Ethanol.  Nor will your board suffer from bird droppings or
urination habits of canines or sudden rainstorms by being outdoors.

No matter how you slice it, Ethanol is faster and easier (assuming you
have a bottle of it, like I do).  The only reason why you would want
to put your board in water, then apply soap, then scrub, then rinse,
then repeat for places you forgot, then rinse, then dry in the sun, is
simply if you do not have a bottle of Ethanol or have no means to buy
it.  Seriously, Ethanol is easy and effective.  I know because we use
it at work every single day on all our electronics devices.  We would
never put our electronics in a washing machine or sink simply because
the drying time is too long, and the fact is that Ethanol cleans the
board with less scrubbing effort too.  A soft bristle toothbrush and
Ethanol works wonders on a dirty circuit board!

I don't say this to hurt the feelings of others nor pooh-pooh their
ideas of washing machine or sink cleaning in water.  I just mention
this to reinforce the fact that, Ethanol would be easier and will dry
in &quot;seconds.&quot;  You the board-washers must therefore determine what
course of action is best for you.  I really couldn't care what your
ultimate choice is, as I make no money off your purchases of Ethanol
or Dish washing liquid!  :-)  Just offering my experience.

Not sure. WD-40 does leave a residue, so perhaps
there was a *bridge* of liquid in places you didn't
clean off. I wouldn't spray any solvents on a mobo,
but radio shack used to, maybe still does, sell an
oxide cleaner in a can. Years ago a mobo that I had
(Tandy 2000) was acting flaky. I took it apart, pulled
all the socketed chips out (THOUGH LEAVING THEM NEXT
TO THE SOCKETS FROM WHICH THEY CAME) and sprayed it
all down. Worked like a charm.
As far as washing a mobo...why? If there was crud all
over it, I could see. Water and soap won't hurt it, I
even tossed a k/b in a basin full of hot water soap
and about a quart of ammonia (one of the_best solvents
around, though it takes time to do it's work), left it
for a few hours, rinsed, dried, and my keys were no
longer sticking. Usually it's a good idea to rattle
the keys while it's been soaking for a while to
dislodge any crud.

I'm curious: is it safe to use ammonia in conjunction
with plastics?  I've never really thought about it
before and am wondering if anyone on the list has had
any, um, unpleasant experiences when doing so.

Somehow, ammonia and keyboards don't strike me as a
particularly happy combination, but I can't say I've
ever tried it myself. [shrugs]

Couldn't you just yank off the key caps and wash them
separately?  I mean, if you're going to take the time
and trouble to clean a keyboard, why not do it
thoroughly?

You can even shortcut this a bit by putting the key
caps (*just* the key caps, thanks) into a lingerie bag
and running them through the dishwasher.  Granted,
this assumes that your particular key plastics can
withstand Very Hot Water and that may not be a given
with some of today's keyboards.

Also, some keyboards do have keys that are easy to
break in removing them (or difficult to replace once
they *have* been removed).  That being the case, you
may want to take a look around and see if there's a
&quot;care and feeding&quot; guide for your particular keyboard
that might tell you which keys to look out for:
