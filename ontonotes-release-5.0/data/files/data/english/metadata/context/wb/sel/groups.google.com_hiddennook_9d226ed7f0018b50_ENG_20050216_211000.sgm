Looks like two evil empires are about to forge an alliance. Sorta reminds you of the Lord of the Rings (Two Towers) when that  evil wizard  and  the burning eye  guy unite for the destruction of middle earth (you can tell I'm not a fan). Anyways, it appears that Syria and Iran are uniting for a "common front."

"We are ready to help Syria on all grounds to confront threats," Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Aref said in Tehran after meeting Syrian Prime Minister Naji al-Otari.

Otari told reporters: "This meeting, which takes place at this sensitive time, is important, especially because Syria and Iran face several challenges and it is necessary to build a common front."
Although Syria maintains that this is not an  anti-US stance , one has to wonder what else it could be. More below.

The simple fact is that after al-Hariri assassination (which Syria is suspected of since al-Hariri often spoke against them) has  many united Lebanese citizens in anger  against Syria even as they  deny any involvement  with the killing.

Syria has gotten themselves into some deep "doo doo" and if they think aligning themselves with Iran is a good thing, they better think again. Iran is already considered a  sponsor of terror  as it already supports terrorists groups like Hezbollah. If Syria wants to avoid the fate of Iraq they should consider pulling out of Lebanon immediately and call off their alliance (the latter of which probably won't happen but the former might under the  right persuasive methods ).

But alas it looks like the war drums are beating. Perhaps  Europe can help us out  and save the day? Then again perhaps not. Here is a picture for your enjoyment. Selah!
