Hello all,

Does anyone know where can I find the download for Ruby::DBI?  I tried
Ruby Forge, but there download only has a Ruby script inside, which
doesn't seem to do anything by itself.  The download at sourceforge has
the setup scripts, but it's an old version of Ruby::DBI.

Is there an alternate download link?  Thx for any info.

I successfully downloaded Ruby::DBI late last night from RubyForge [
http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-dbi/ ]. Strangely, though, I had to use
IE; Firefox messed up the download every time. Only after downloading with
IE was I able to decompress the .tar.gz file using the latest version of
7zip. I haven't tried downloading it on my Mac.

I encountered the same problem with Iceweasel (Debian Firefox fork)
last night. I've never encountered that problem before with any IW/FF
downloads from other sites, so there must be something different about
the rubyforge site. In my case, on Linux, I just use wget to download
anything needed, and it always works.  The problem I got was a partial
download - proper signature in the ...tgz file, but unable to unpack.
Same results on several different files.
