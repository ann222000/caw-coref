Yes, I confess. I don't know much about rotorcrafts. Especially
regarding gyrocopters my knowledge is even more limited.

However, on the net I just stumbled over UFO HeliThruster. Rumors are
that it is rather stable. The manufacturer not only sells kits but also
(FAA-?) certified planes.

If I would buy such a certified HeliThruster, fit it with the necessary
instruments, and give it an N-registration, would I be allowed to fly it
IFR given that I had the necessary pilot certificates? Would I be
allowed to fly it outside US?

Thank you for sharing your knowledge!

With the certified probably not. With the EX-AB sure, if you can get the DAR
to write the limitations correctly.

If you do this let us know. We are always looking for a deal on good used
avionics and salvage is usually a pretty good place to look.

I did a little looking and there doesn't seem to be an FAA certified version

&gt;UFO HeliThruster
">

Apparently this auto-gyro is incapable of recovering from negative G
forces.  It is unclear what method is used to prevent encountering
meteorologically generated negative G force in the case of turbulence
for instance.

http://www.ufo-helithruster.com/safety_ufo_helithruster_gyrocopter.html
First PPO &quot;Power Push Over&quot;, by far the most dangerous of the
three scenarios discussed here. What happens here is the gyro is
deliberately forced nose down creating &quot;Negative G&quot;. Negative G is
almost always non recoverable. Gyros are NOT designed to do this
maneuver. PPO is a flight maneuver (deliberate) at the top of a
climb or a nose-down dive from level flight.

Further, an “innocent” POWER ON can bring about PPO! Innocent in
that it should be a safe thing to do, that is, putting power on.
If the design of the gyro has some fundamentals wrong with it, or
a combination of them; high profile C of G, poor stability,
insufficient tail profile, then when power is applied vigorously
the propeller in such a craft can push the &quot;top&quot; of the Gyro
forward while the &quot;bottom&quot; lags (drags) behind, thus inducing PPO.
Technically what has happened in PPO is that the ROTOR has (in
effect) been uncoupled from the aircraft. Therefore, if you unload
the rotor (by making a zero-g maneuver) the rotor drag almost
vanishes and the thrust of the engine will make the aircraft
nose-down.

Power Push Over are done by people who are stupid, maybe to
impress a crowd they will dive at high speed, pull out at the
bottom which loads up the G forces (the rotor revs will
automatically increase), they do a spectacular zoom upwards and
when they reach the position when they stop climbing, we are in
zero-g, for a second there is no incoming air to turn the blades,
even worse the airflow is reversed, and this has a dramatic effect
on stopping rotor revs. With decreased rotor revs a pilot pushes
the stick forward, but it is too late; it is impossible to recover
lost revs.

This sounds scary stuff and it is. We hope you aren't stupid
enough to see if PPO is unrecoverable. But let's put this in
perspective, when you fly an airplane you know you can't land it
up side down, so you don't do it; with gyros you can't fly in
zero-g so you don't do it.

On the helmet issue, fighter pilots wear helmets and in the event of a crash

ejecting and the helmet plays a big role in protecting the pilot in that

I have to ask, what's your life worth to you?  If a helmet will increase my
chances of living through a given situation by a couple of percentage
points, I don't have a problem wearing one!

As far as gyrocopters are concern, I agree, they're not an ideal IFR
platform.  However, neither are helicopters when you get right down to it
but they fly IFR all the time.  Making an aircraft IFR certified, at least
as I understand it, is more a matter of installed equipment (gauges, radios,
auto pilots?) than the aircraft itself.

The issues that Gyros have with negative G's make them less IFR capable than

In in most cases, in the experimental-HB arena the only difference in a IFR

Can a helmet save your life? sure. Will a helmet save your life? depends on
the circumstances. Davey Allison (NASCAR driver) probably would have survied
his crash, if the reports are to be believed. Right before I got out we lost
a Lt. during a ground run on a Blackhawk, cause of death? head trauma. Had
he followed procedures the accident wouldn't have happened. Had he worn a
helmet he'd have survived. Altough, I'm not sure I'd have been able to live
with the guilt in having killed the crewchief as well.
The point? sometimes helmet head is better than the alternative.

I came across an abandoned autogyro in the Oklahoma panhandle in a farmer's
field alongside his other abandoned trucks and tractors. It was a two-place
tandem fully enclosed fiberglass cockpit with what I believe was a 260 HP
engine. I think it was built by Aerospace Industries if I remember right,
and it carried an N-number registration. I'm pretty sure it would cruise
above 100 mph because it had a pretty small rotor diameter.

I used to regret I didn't try to talk the guy into letting me haul it out of
his field for him ;-)

Is this claim a Mollerism?

http://www.cartercopters.com/
I have heard that two-bladed, teetering rotor systems have a
reputation for something called &quot;mast bumping&quot; in low-g flight.
What is mast bumping, and why is the CarterCopter not susceptible
to this problem?

Mast bumping is caused in helicopters by a lack of control of the
aircraft due to the rotor not producing much lift or negative
lift. During a zero-g maneuver, when the rotor is unloaded, it
does not create any lift force, so it does not have any force to
apply to the helicopter to control it. In this situation, if the
pilot moves the cyclic to try and control the aircraft, the rotor
will still tilt, but since it is producing no net lift, it will
not have a reaction on the rest of the aircraft. If the pilot
inputs more control because he does not feel the aircraft
responding, he makes the rotor tilt even more, until it hits the
mast. The tail rotor can aggravate this problem. Because it is
still producing a force, it pushes the aircraft to the side, and
if it's not directly on the centerline, causes the aircraft to
roll as well. The pilot feeling this movement will try to counter
it with the stick, causing the problem outlined above, with the
tail rotor pushing the fuselage in the opposite direction of the
rotor.

In the CarterCopter, because of the dual control system (airplane
as well as autogyro), the pilot always has control of the
aircraft, as long as he has sufficient airspeed. During a zero-g
maneuver, with the rotor unloaded and producing no lift, the
elevators and ailerons are still effective. When the pilot moves
the stick, the ailerons or elevator will control the fuselage,
keeping it in approximately the same relative position compared to
the rotor, so mast bumping is not a problem.

My take is that in the case of an engine failure, the gyro driver has the
&quot;autorotate&quot; maneuver as his emergency landing option.  The chance of a
survivable but hard landing is a real possibility.  A helmet would possibly
help that hard landing be survivable.

On the other hand, a fixed wing emergency landing is likely to be relatively
smooth, (no helmet needed) or so hard that a helmet would not likely help
much.

That's my guess, anyway.

True, but I've never seen a car driver wearing a helmet either, except for
those in race cars.  From what I've read, a significant number of deaths in
auto accidents are caused by head injuries so how many of those could have
been saved if they'd been wearing a helmet?   We can argue this one till
hell freezes over.  It's easy to &quot;what if&quot; ourselves smooth into a corner.
Suffice to say, if the person wants to wear a helmet, regardless of what
their driving/riding/flying, more power to them!

The gyro guys would argue it this way.

Engine failure in the gyro:

You glide down in an autorotation and land.  Unlike helicopters, the gyro
pilot doesn't have to do anything except lower the nose to maintain
airspeed.  Fixed wing pilots should be able to relate to this.  The gyros
rotor is already in an autorotative state so the pilot doesn't have to do
anything extra (like lower the collective) to initiate this mode.  At the
appropriate point, the pilot initiates a flare that slows the aircrafts
descent rate and forward airspeed and touches down at a ground speed of
something less than 10 to 15 mph.  With a bit of a headwind, it's not
uncommon for the landing speed to be less than 5 mph and if the pilot is
skilled, a 0 mph touchdown is quite common.

Engine failure in a fixed wing:

Like the gyro pilot, the airplane pilot most lower the nose to maintain
airspeed and setup their best glide speed.  At the appropriate point, the
pilot initiates a flare to lower the aircrafts descent rate and forward
airspeed to be followed by a touch down at (depending on the aircraft) a
ground speed of anywhere from 55 to 100 mph.

Hmmm, let's see, would I rather come to the ground at 10 mph or 55+ mph?
That's a tuff one!  If the pilot is properly trained and current in his/her
skills, both aircraft can be landed safely in the event of an engine
failure.  Don't assume that the gyro is automatically going to be a hard
landing and the airplane is automatically going to be a smooth one.  It's
just not that simple.

FWIW!
Fly Safe,

I take from the tone that you are an autogyro guy. :-)

I know and understand how an autogyro handles an engine failure.  It is a
smooth landing, and slow, _if_ the pilot does everything right, and if
sufficient altitude and forward speed exist at the time of the failure.

If the pilot misjudges the flare, bump.  If the engine craps at a low
altitude, and there is not enough time to trade altitude for airspeed and
rotor speed, bump.  Helmets help bumps.

If a fixed wing has good altitude and speed, he has a chance to get a smooth
landing, if there is suitable room for a landing.  No need for helmet,
perhaps.  Not enough room, probably, a helmet won't help.

If there is not sufficient altitude and airspeed, and there could be a
stall-spin, also, there will probably be little left that a helmet could
help.

If anything, I'm coming down on the side of a gyro accident being (possibly)
more survivable, and a helmet would definitely help, when it comes right
down to the last seconds.

Lastly, I know these are all probably's.  No solid rule holds for everything
in life.

It just my gut feeling that a helmet is likely to do you more good in an
autogyro than a fixed wing.  Not in an enclosed cockpit fixed wing?
Probably going to want a helmet, for one of those, too.  That also reminds
me of another reason so many autogyro drivers wear helmets.  The majority of
autogyros probably are open cockpit, too.

And, of course, there is this early autogiro:

http://www.aviation-history.com/airmen/earhart-Autogiro.htm
Pitcairn PCA-2 Autogiro
Amelia Earhart’s second Autogiro crash is known from a single
source, a letter39 to author Susan Butler from Helen Collins
MacElwee, sister of Amelia’s New York, Philadelphia and Washington
Airway Corporation (NYPWA) colleague Paul Collins. Paul Collins
and his sister Helen witnessed the second accident. After a
&quot;rather erratic&quot; Autogiro flight she made after taking off from
the airfield in Camden, New Jersey, she &quot;finally landed on a
fence. Amelia stepped out frustrated and furious, and announced,
&quot;I’ll never get in one of those machines again. I couldn’t handle
it at all.&quot; Earhart’s third accident in an Autogiro occurred
during her subsequent Beech-Nut tour while at the Michigan State
Fair in Detroit, Michigan on September 12, 1931. Attempting a slow
landing in front of the grandstand, she failed to level off in
time and dropped twenty feet to the ground. She wrote her mother:
&quot;My giro spill was a freak accident. The landing gear gave way
from a defect and I ground-looped only. The rotors were smashed as
usual with giros, but there wasn’t even a jar.&quot;

Hi Jim,

First, sorry if I came across with a &quot;tone!&quot;  The post I responded to
&quot;sounded&quot; (maybe not intentionally) like there was a significant bias
against gyros that &quot;seemed&quot; at the time to be all too familiar.

For the record, I'm not an autogyro guy.  I have done a LOT of research into
them back in the early to mid '90's because I was seriously interested in
them at that time.  I never got to the point where I was willing to invest
in them for a number of reasons.  Back then, there seemed to be significant
differences of opinion on what was safe and what wasn't with regards to gyro
design, especially pusher style gyros, and I was around when a number of &quot;so
called&quot; experienced pilots bit the dust.  One of them just did something
stupid and paid the ultimate price.  The reasons for a couple of other
fatalities were never solidly identified but there was plenty of assumptions
and accusations flying around, leading so some pretty ugly arguments, and it
ultimately left me with a bad taste in my mouth so I backed off.

These days, I still look into them from time to time and it seems that there
is much more of a consensus concerning what's appropriate and what's not
with regards to the aircrafts design, balance, and other setup issues.  I
firmly believe that the autogyro is as safe as any aircraft out there
provided the aircraft is properly assembled and maintained, AND, &quot;&quot;the pilot
has proper training!!&quot;&quot;  You said basically the same thing in your response
to me and I agree with you 100%.

For me at this point, I still have an interest in the autogyro, as I do in
all rotorcraft, but my &quot;bug&quot; to own and fly one had fallen back in the
shadows of my list of things to do in life.  Right now, I've simply got
other things that I need/want to spend my money on!  ;-)

All the best,
Steve R.

As a past gyro pilot from the days when instruction simply wasn't possible
and a licensed &quot;Stuck Wing&quot; pilot as well as helo rated, I chose to wear a
helmet.  I only  needed it in the gyro to attenuate the noisy engine.  I
never wore a helmet in the &quot;Stuck Wing&quot; simply because I didn't have one.
However when we encountered the rotor off the Sierra wave one day I could
have used the helmet to keep my head from beating on the canopy of a T-34.
I chose to wear the helmet in a helicopter because in a crash and even with
zero forward speed, the blades can contact something outside and start
flinging shrapnel about.  Also the chief instructor of the test pilot school
has said he doesn't feel too safe in a helicopter where the pilot is not
helmeted.  His example was a bird came thru the windscreen and the helmet
with visor saved the pilot from serious injury and the passengers from a
sh--ty ride with an unconscious pilot.  Also a widely experienced bush pilot
of my acquaintenance requires his pilots working for him in the &quot; Stuck
Wings&quot; to wear helmet, Nomex suits and gloves.  This highly experienced
pilot has a bunch of stories that supply good reasons for insisting on these
safety items.

&gt;&gt;&gt; With the certified probably not. With the EX-AB sure, if you can get the

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you do this let us know. We are always looking for a deal on good

&gt;&gt; LOL.  I was wondering how you'd bring

&gt; You might also want to ask yourself why
