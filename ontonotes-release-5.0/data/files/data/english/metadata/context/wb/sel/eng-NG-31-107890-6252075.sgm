I have a 1930s Zenith Chairside with several bands and am wondering
what the best antenna arrangement would be.

A major complication is that I am an urban cliffdweller - live in an
apartment, so I can't hang anything outside.  I do have large windows.

My basic question is whether a dipole is likely to work better than a
longer antenna with the other side grounded.

If it has a single antenna terminal screw, the longer the wire, the
better. Run it around the room, over the window moulding, ets. Ken

Use a Noodle- longest piece of flexible wire you can fit behind the
furniture or conceal along a molding or baseboard.

OR I can detail contruction of Stealth antennas of 30 gauge magnet wire it
you have access to the roof. Years ago a friend had an antenna across 9th
Avenue in Manhattan done this way. One ham I've heard of regularly
constructs 1500 ft. Beverage antennas across an Interstate for contests
(don't try this at home).

PS- AC operated radios rarely benefit from discrete grounds, being grounded
through the neutral of the powerline. Besides, a good clean ground is the
shortest thickest wire possible to a long copper coated stake or stakes- not
a viable option for you anyway likely.

Having grown up in an apartment, I can give you some hints.  We used to
take old coils which had fine wire in them and go up on the roof of the
apartment and unwind the coil slowly.  Since it was very thin wire, no one
saw it.  Then when it passed by our window on the first floor, we would pull
it in.  Up top we would attach the wire to anything convenient and we were
off and running and no one saw it.  Illegal?  Yes, but invisible too.  Do
such antennas work?  You would be amazed what 65 feet of wire can do on all
frequencies despite the lack of precision cutting of lengths.  And we used
the steam pipes as a ground too.

City apartments have steam heat.  Use those pipes.  The sure as heck are
NOT plastic!!!

But also be careful of old radios running on AC.  One side is always hot,
and if you turn it off the hot side reverses too.  I've done quite a job on
radios like that with a ground...hehehe.  I've also gotten hurt.

Others have covered the ground well, but to summarize and simplify a
couple of points:

Antennas do not care about gauge. So concern yourself with that only to
the extent that strength is required. Similarly with insulation. Unless
actually shielded, a vinyl-insulated wire is no worse than a bare wire
which is no worse or better than magnet wire (varnished).

I jokingly follow what I call the 'left hand rule of mazes' when I set
up concealed antennas at home. We have a 117 year old house with
3-piece baseboards. So I can always skoonch the wire along the base
invisibly with a dull putty knife, also make it past, under or around
door moldings and so forth. If you have (as we do) three bedrooms and
five closets on our second floor (eschew wet locations for antennas as
a overly cautious safety choice), that is A LOT of perimeter. And the
third floor has two bedrooms and three closets, the ground floor even
more perimeter. So, start at a given point and keep turning 'left'
until you get back to your starting point. I used 24 ga enameled wire
on the second floor, something like 150' of it. From the antenna, I can
use a bit of insulated wire and either sand-and-solder a bit of a lead
to the concealed wire or just an alligator clip rubbed hard to grab
through the enamel.

If you have stretched carpet, it is easy to get a wire behind the
tackless and treat it similarly. As a cliff-dweller you already have
the elevation.

If you use _ANY_ sort of external or roof-mounted antenna, be sure to
install the proper lightning arrester and knife-switch to disconnect
the antenna when not in use. For the same reasons one does not run
antenna through wet locations.... overly cautious safety choice.

We also do have radiators, I use new-work ground clamps as needed to
get good grounds when required. The system is grounded at the boiler
and with a separate ground both to the rod and to the water service
(local code for gas-fired appliances). Just be careful if your have
similar systems that have been modernized. We have installed Runtal
radiators in place of some of the honking-big cast-iron units and as I
went from black iron to copper, I installed dielectric unions against
electrolysis. So those radiators and associated supply piping are not
good grounds.

Some stations come in better using an antenna designed following the
"right hand rule of mazes".

I know 2-piece and 1-piece baseboards, what exactly does a 3-piece
baseboard look like?  Are there 2-piece baseboards that have the same
look as 3-piece baseboards?  I have a vague feeling that I have seen
3-piece baseboards that were essentially the same as 2-piece baseboards,
except the main piece was made of two separate pieces.

With some mediaeval mazes, putting your right hand on the maze will
return you to the entrance. So, I guess radios requiring loop antennas
will follow the right-hand rule.

I guess my question boils down to this, I get the impression that in the
old days the main baseboard was a piece of wood with a rectangular cross
section and to this was added a decorative cap, and a piece of quarter
round at the base.  More modern implementations of the same look often
seem to have the decorative "cap" cut as part of the main piece of
baseboard, giving a "2-piece" baseboard with the look of a "3-piece"
baseboard.  Am I totally or just mildly confused about this?

That is generally correct. However in true "3-piece" baseboard, the cap
protrudes well beyond the rectangular section and makes the toe
necessary to prevent straight-legged furniture from bunging the cap.
With the modern 2-piece base, the rectangular section is the limiting
dimension, the cap carving does not protrude. Also modern base is
usually 1" (3/4 finished) stock and so the profile is much thinner
overall. Our baseboard is a full 1-3/4" thick with 5/4 (1" net) base
and 1" (3/4 net) toe molding. Most modern systems net out at 1-1/4"
overall.

I have to chime in here about the old baseboards. Back in the days when
there were real carpenters and houses built with pride before everything
was caulked to make up for shoddy work the base was a three piece
system. The reason was you cannot make a 1" thick board tight to a
plaster wall. The base cap was thin and pliable enough to conform to the
wall and the shoe molding(not quarter round) took care of the gap where
the floor met the base. It had nothing to do with chairs but was the
result of good craftsmanship which is hard to find these days even in a
$500,000 house.

Nowadays, you're lucky if a "baseboard" consists of a black or grey
rubber strip that's glued where the wall meets the floor.

My mom's flat in a vintage late-1940s housing project has METAL
baseboards.

It's essentially a steel strip that is embedded into the masonry walls
(the walls in the apartment consist of concrete over metal mesh lath
for fire-proofing).  Years ago, these used to be painted black by the
Housing Authority, but now everyone just slaps the same flat color
paint from floor to ceiling.

I tend to think that an antenna in an apartment building, however
cleverly constructed, is going to offer disappointing performance in a
way that was not an issue 25 or so years ago. A modern dwelling has a
computer (maybe more than one), DVD player (ditto), cable or satellite
box, and other gadgets and gizmos that have high-frequency oscillators
and use switching power supplies that generate objectionable
interference on the shortwave bands.

It is fairly easy to control this situation in a single-family home, it
is impossible in an apartment building.

Before I spent any time putting wires under baseboards, I would do the
more basic test of whether reception is even possible among the RF
interference generated by all the other tenants' electronic activities.
It may very well be that the receiver is overwhelmed by the noise.

for all the reasons Scott mentioned it could be that one of those loop
style antennas might be better than the long wire... at least you can
turn them to reduce some of the objectionable noises.

There's your antenna!  That is, if it's not grounded.

I find the telephone idea the most interesting -- in spite of the fact that
it's hardest to read.  It appears you set the telephone on a metal plate,
and connect the plate to the radio.  Interesting.

I recall my dad telling me that, a long time ago, he wanted to improve
reception on a table radio he had.  So he connected the antenna wire to the
telephone.  Radio reception was fantastic, but after a few days he noticed
he wasn't getting any phone calls.  When a friend told him he was trying to
get through, he called the phone company -- forgetting about the antenna.  A
technician stopped in, saw the radio connection, and told him that was the
problem.  He then said -- "If you want good radio reception, use THIS wire,
not that one."

Actually I'd be afraid to try any of them, as often the extra wires are used
elsewhere.  Plus, even with a capacitor, your radio could get a nice zap
when the telephone rings -- something like 90 volts, 25 Hz.  There's also no
telling what could be disrupted in terms of broadband internet or other
telephone add-ons.

Still, if you know for a fact that it's an unused wire, the telephone
connection through a cap might be a workable idea.

&gt;&gt;I have a 1930s Zenith Chairside with several bands and am wondering
&gt;&gt; what the best antenna arrangement would be.

Remember those little "rocket radios" with slug tuning, a crystal detector,
and a hi-Z ceramic earpiece? These were commonly connected to the finger
stop on a dial telephone.
