There's no such thing as a &quot;consciousness meter,&quot; so how would we ever
know if rocks, or plants, or other animals tingle with the spark of
spirit? Philosopher de Quincey tells a story of one student who could
not accept the possibility that rocks may be nonconscious. He points
out that science aims to tell us about the actual world, while
philosophy explores possible worlds.......

The great philosopher Jesus proclaimed:

If you shut up their mouths, the stones would cry out.

Sure stones are conscious.

What happens when you bust them up then?

They become the previous rock's children.

Well, in a way there is a &quot;consciousness meter&quot;.  Or at least a way
for humans to
observe degrees of consciousness.  We do it all the time.  Doctors
make judgements not only of whether patients are conscious but how
conscious they are particularly anaesthetists.  If consciousness were
not an obsevable phenomonon there wouldn't be so much discussion of
it.

One might argue, with much inductive support, that any arrangement of
unit activities sufficiently emulating animal brain unit activities,
will be as conscious as those animals, lest those animals couldn't
possibly be conscious. That is if consciousness is the same as
&quot;activities of one of these brains.&quot;

Functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what
makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on
its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the
role it plays, in the system of which it is a part. This doctrine is
rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in
Hobbes's conception of the mind as a &quot;calculating machine&quot;, but it has
become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last
third of the 20th century. Though the term 'functionalism' is used to
designate a variety of positions in a variety of other disciplines,
including psychology, sociology, economics, and architecture, this
entry focuses exclusively on functionalism as a philosophical thesis
about the nature of mental states.

Sir Frederick wrote, probably as rhetorical questions, but what the
heck:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Do rocks experience qualia such as
&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;? Do rocks experience
&gt; quale such as &quot;red&quot;?
">

A  capacity to detect--signified by repulsive, attractive, additive, and
detractive responses between properties or entities--seems a primary
essential to any definition of consciousness, but cannot solely
constitute biological or psychological meanings of it (if such must
include qualia or etc).

Rocks don't fall through a table because the negative charge of their
electrons detect the negative charge of the electrons in the table, and
they resultingly obey a principle of being repelled by each other. The
solidness of metaphysical &quot;stuff&quot; like classical matter, as some
Enlightenment philosophers realized, would require an explanation itself
as a force that resists penetration, and such repulsive forces
(including attractive ones) seem irreducibly left as rules that are
simply obeyed by natural order, rather than being a solid &quot;substance&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Do rocks have models of their situation,

&gt; Do rocks &quot;self&quot;?

All metempirical questions about inner states of matter, where both yes
or no answers are meaningless unless they are useful in some context.
Currently, it seems quite practical not to waste time with such notions,
so that &quot;no&quot; is warranted. A thousand years from now, however, I
wouldn't want to anger a nanotechnological-based &quot;pet rock&quot; with that
opinion (especially if it had tucked-away teeth and legs).

This question shows a  mis-understanding consciousness. Consciousness
is what we do with our senses and our experiences.
A thing (even a human) born with no senses has no consciousness.
Just what would a rock be conscious of?
What would a glass of water be aware of?

How do you define a 'sense organ'? Or 'processing information'?  Rocks
are not somehow isolated from the rest of the universe, and when the
environment changes, that information may be translated into a change
within the rock. After all, geologists delve into the memories of
rocks like psychologists do with humans.

Well a sense organ is something like a eye, ear, tongue, nose or skin, which
takes in information from the external world with the intention of forming a
mental picture of its immediate surroundings. For example, the eye takes in
rays of light and uses that information to form a picture of what is visible
nearby. The retina converts it into electrical signals which pass to the
rear brain, where (somehow) the internal mental image is formed. (Of course,
this is the part that is still a mystery!)

Now a rock or stone does not have anything of this nature in its &quot;anatomy&quot;.
I suppose you could say: when the weather gets hot, the rock responds to
this by heating up. The rock's internal molecules get hotter. But I think
this is stretching the comparison a bit. The rock is not really measureing
the temperature of its surroundings but only its internal temperature. And
information about temperature is not really being sent anywhere. It never
goes further than a given molecule. A coherent picutre of the rocks
surroundings is not really formed. The molecules of the rock do not react
dynamically in any way to this &quot;temperature information&quot; to make even the
most basic logical deductions.

Furthermore we know that rocks are not living organisms. They have not
evolved to fit in with their environment. The reason people have
consciousness is because knowledge of one's external surroundings is a huge
advantage in survival.

To give another example: Most people have colour vision, due to cones in the
retina. Thus, then can distinguish between red and blue, from which they
form the abstract concepts of &quot;redness&quot; and &quot;blueness&quot;. Any dog is
colour-blind, due to not possessing cones in his retina. Thus, he can not be
aware of a distinction between &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; in his environment, and
certainly cannot form concepts of &quot;redness&quot; and &quot;blueness&quot;.

Now if a dog has no understanding of the red/blue distinction, how can a
simple rock?

In my view, fundamental (primary) and universal perceptive means have
nothing to do with the five senses of humans. Humans do have access to
primary perceptive means in addition to the the five physical senses.
These various primary means are referred to as ESP or Extra Sensory
Perception. People who are particularly sensitive to ESP are called
&quot;psychics&quot;.

It seems to me that humans once placed high value on ESP and
probably used such primary perception for survival needs. For
example, Australian Aborigines would gather in groups for their
&quot;dream time&quot; where water sources were sought via primary
perception. The next morning the tribe would go trotting off
100 miles to a agreed upon location. Once human

In my view, there is nothing whatsoever that's not
conscious and capable of primary perception. At the
level of a rock, there is a rock consciousness gestalt.
I've read that some people can communicate with such
gestalts. It would be very difficult though to establish
that particular ability scientifically, I would think.

&gt; &gt; There's no such thing as a &quot;consciousness meter,&quot; so how would we ever
&gt; &gt; know if rocks, or plants, or other animals tingle with the spark of
&gt; &gt; spirit?

Rocks can certainly cry out if you chisel messages into them.

I think you highlight a problem with language Ed. There are many ways that
the word 'consciousness' is used, and the medical use of the word is one way
that is clearly an observable phenomenon, but it isn't the use that is at
issue here. The word is being used here to say that there's a subjective
perspective upon a world that is entirely private -- I don't have access to
anybody else's subjective perspective, and they don't have access to mine.
That being the case, 'consciousness' in this sense is certainly *not* an
observable phenomenon. Indeed, it is only a conviction, rather than an
observation, that other people have 'consciousness' at all. Additionally,
it is only a conviction that there is anything that *doesn't* have it.

&gt; In my view, fundamental (primary) and universal perceptive means have

&gt; &quot;psychics&quot;.

&gt; It seems to me that humans once placed high value on ESP and
&gt; probably used such primary perception for survival needs. For
&gt; example, Australian Aborigines would gather in groups for their
&gt; &quot;dream time&quot; where water sources were sought via primary

Supposing for a moment that ESP is real, it is a form of
thought-transference of distant events into the mind. In the example you
give, the Aborigines are able to detect a source of water 100 miles away,
and the knowledge about it enters their mind. Therefore, it must be
registered somewhere each Aborigine's brain, so that it can be remembered
later. Memories are perhaps laid down in the brain in the form of engrams or
memory traces.

Now, a rock does not have a brain or similar organ, so even if it could
detect a source of water 100 miles away, where would this information be
place in its structure? Where would the memories be laid down?

The problem of other minds will especially become irksome as roboticists
engineer more complex versions of these robots that mimic human facial
and body expressions. I recollect one philosopher who was astonished at
the way some scientists/techs were referring to their creations as if
they actually did have feelings just because of the external activity of
them (behaviorism isn't dead after all?). Which probably points out why
the private language argument doesn't really slay the OM/solipsism
problem as a few Anglo-American philosophers believe, since &quot;smart&quot;
zombie androids would have public languge, too.

is just a physical organ that allows us to connect with the Absolute...

But of course we DO have access to others subjective perspective, I
have a pretty good idea of what my wife's subjective perspective is on
most things.

A hypothetical phenomenon that is, in principal, undetectable, runs
the risk of being seen as a chimera.  The only reason philosophers
believe in consciousness is that they are convinced that they have it
even if no one else does.  The question is how to establish that they
are not mistaken in this belief.  In various forms this has all been
debated here but I, for one, am skeptical of things that are claimed
to be &quot;real&quot; but which, by their very nature, are completely
undetectable.  In terms of proof, the soul and private consciousness
are on a par.

As in the case of my wife, consciousness that engenders detectable
behaviour is a different thing altogether, which, I suppose, is why
philosophers fenced off the aspect of consciousness that is called
&quot;private&quot;.

My greatest concern is that this illness may someday spread from that
small minority to populations at large. For instance, the other day a
colleague of mine described a dream he had experienced the night
before that was filled with images and sounds so bizarre that they
could not have corresponded to anything in the actual environment of
his bedroom. Not desiring to be rude, I pretended that I was familiar
with the meaningless word *dream* and the fantastic notion of his
brain causing a private virtual reality of phenomena that did not have
a *live* connection or integration with exo-cranial, public
circumstances. While it may not be as dangerous as the Bird Flu in
terms of potential body count, I still hope there are eliminativists
or strong-externalists or direct realists or somebody hard at work

To communicate timeless experiences, I would suggest using the present

stretch a language beyond its ordinary usage to deal with new experiences.

Sure, but if the listener has no similar experience he/she can't
relate or understand ... unless somehow his/her psyche comes
through with its knowledge, resulting in a intuitive &quot;aha&quot;. That
route requires openness ... a temporary disabling of the critical
faculties.

Now, OTOH, I've had many experiences of &quot;Aha, now I get it&quot; when
reading ancient Hindu texts and other mystical sources, ... but only
after studying the metaphysical/mystical/spiritual ideas written in

Well, in order to truly understand consciousness, we would have to
understand exactly how the mind and brain interact with one another. You
have the idea that the mind permeates the brain. I understand what you mean.
That metaphor conjures up certain intuitive images. But I think you need to
be more precise, and be more specific about what is actually going on and
how. Otherwise, you have not completely understood consciousness, and the
whole mind/brain problem.

Another way of looking at the situation is to suggest that consciousness is
an emergent phenomenon of the brain. Once the brain reaches a certain level
of complexity, of interconnectedness, or once it starts doing a certain
physical process, then consciousness emerges out of it. But this description
is also incomplete We need to say exactly what is happening and how!

You moved from not understanding a written text to suddenly understanding it

get it and think, &quot;Oh! So that's what it means!&quot;

I obviously _do_ think there are limitations to human knowledge. If
I'm right, and there is nothing whatsover that is without
consciousness of its own kind ... then I cannot imagine any way
that it can be understood except in observational and behavioural

human consciousness/mind.

That is not my understanding. The subjects studied had only a brain
stem as I recall. In any event, brain cell tissue around the inner
edge of the skull disconnected from the stem would be useless
debris.

What's amazing too is that the subjects apparently developed normal
visual and auditory capabilities without all the extensive brain
machinery that's involved with such functions in normal brains. Yet,
if a normal person suffers damage to certain of these areas, he/she
will lose all or part of the functionality. So it seems infants who
lack certain brain areas right from the beginning may learn to adapt
and do ok without them. This raises a question in my mind. Why is
it then that normal persons who suffer certain  brain traumas
can never seem to adapt? Why does the mind become so dependent
on the normal brain functionality?

How can consciousness magically emerge out of non-consciousness
entities? That sounds completely absurd, like the old notion of
spontaneous generation. Each of our cells have a tiny amount of
consciousness. You get a lot of cells together and link them up and you
get a lot more consciousness. No need to invoke magic, science and
simple logic will do.

I haven't thought this through but I agree if &quot;consciousness&quot; includes
all of a persons experiences.  However if &quot;consciousness&quot; is a process
carried out in the brain or elsewhere then there could be two people
with the identical process but different experiences and/or sense
data.  The sense data would always be different, of course, since no
one senses the entire common world, just the parts near them.

Each person is unique but the differences may not be such as to
preclude a common process, especially if the process of consciousness
is carried out in the brain which appears to be able to accommodate
quite a bit of internal &quot;noise&quot;.  I guess the question is whether

A perspective or POV usually involves structure, and those relations
can be communicated via language of one sort or another. But if one
can concern cognitive properties that exhibit no structure within
themselves, then there would be a problem in communicating such to
cognitive systems (either human novelties or ETs) that lack those
phenomenal elements.

AFAIK, no one has succeeded yet in delivering through language an
experience of &quot;what red or green or blue is&quot; to a person suffering
their whole life from achromatopsia; or an experience of &quot;what pain
is&quot; to a person suffering their whole life from CIPA. An artificial or
&quot;possible world&quot; scenario like the &quot;Mary's Room&quot; argument is almost
unnecessary when these natural or real-life examples having been

I've only recently began to fully appreciate how interaction actually
requires pluralism or individuation (so much for the classic knock
against dualisms). By its very nature, a monism would be devoid of
features and inter-relations, which is not what we find empirically.
Hegel's seemingly useless, sequential alternating between a uniform
&quot;nothing&quot; state and a multiplicity of states could have use after all
in resolving the conflict between universal unity and individuation.

Then we return to my previous point that the word 'consciousness' has many
variant uses, and that your use of the word above may be a perfectly valid
use. I wouldn't want to discourage your use of the word, just as I wouldn't
want to discourage the anesthetist's use of the word, but we must take care
in conversation not to confuse these variant uses. I'm using the word,
as indicated, to allude to the experiential gestalt that is assumed to
accompany all other people (and probably all other mammals, and possibly
all other animals). Going back to my initial point, it is nothing more than
a conviction that some specific kind of object (e.g. a water molecule) has
no associated experiential gestalt, though if it does have one then the data
entailed by that gestalt would likely not be as rich as those entailed by,
e.g. a cell, and going up another level, an organism. I believe this use to
be consistent with the OP's use when he asks &quot;Are Rocks Conscious?&quot;

&quot;Thingness&quot; in terms of epistemology or &quot;thingness&quot; in terms of
ontology? Since we'd have to begin by examining how we apprehend
objects or their defining properties / borders in experience, anyway,
I'll venture into the former for now and save any metaphysical
explorations of what &quot;thingness&quot; might be in materialism, objective
idealism, and etc for later.

I tend a bit toward Wilfred Sellars' &quot;Myth of the Given&quot; (and etc) to
the extent that we must conceptually categorize objects just to
discuss them as propositional knowledge at all; and if those
recognition processes are dependent upon language, then they probably
would be theory-laden or cultural dependent as anti-foundational
philosophers of the 20th century suggested. IOW, even empirical
phenomena would then be the product of inference rather than being
&quot;directly given&quot;.

But I'd disagree with them that culturally acquired judgements are
soley responsible for abstracting &quot;thingness&quot; from the general unity
of experience. Other animals, for instance, don't possess our complex
language skills and IMO their intentionality depends upon innate
feelings and emotionally-tagged memory patterns in place of linguistic
conceptual templates.

Whereas human intentionality and the value assigned to objects in the
course of its roving seem superficially driven by language (the
conscious recognition and meaning of a &quot;tree phenomenon&quot; is my
thinking privately the very words: &quot;That is a maple tree growing in
the middle of the park&quot;), I nevertheless feel that there is a more
primitive, animal undercurrent of memory connections and emotions
beneath that which are also fueling focus, identification, and value.
More a case of stored &quot;phenomena&quot; being conjuncted to live phenomena
at that sub-level. In fact, the lingusitic thoughts themselves would
be experienced as acoustic sensations providing meaning for a visual
phenomenon like the tree (tactile for somebody like Helen Keller).

Back to what I started with before differing with it. Below is Thomas
Vinci's way of summarizing  certain points of Wilfrid Sellars'; but
beware of possible misrepresentation, as his goal was to criticize the
&quot;Myth of the Given&quot; in the course of that paper:

1. All knowledge of interest to foundationalists is propositional
knowledge.

2. All propositional knowledge is an act of classificatory cognition.

3. All classificatory cognition involves &quot;learning, concept formation,
even the use of symbols&quot;.

4. All knowledge of interest to foundationalists involves &quot;learning,

5. Knowledge of subject-predicate propositions is an act of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My web page gives a few examples in support of the thesis that
&gt; everything is a form of primal conscious energy. Concerning the
&gt; human brain, I point to a British study of hydraencephalepics.
&gt; Emergentists will have to explain how many people born without
&gt; brains have normal and even high intelligence ... and function well
&gt; in society. I suppose they might argue that such brainless people
&gt; aren't conscious even though one, at least, earned a mathematics
&gt; degree with honors :)

&gt; You're right, of course, that brain-mind duality is merely a concept
&gt; and a thesis which lacks &quot;how does it work&quot; explanations. Personally,
&gt; I've been more intrigued by the question of how the time illusion
&gt; is created in our physical reality. That question seems to me to
&gt; have a possible answer and explanation. However, in my view,
&gt; explaining consciousness itself is tantamount to explaining the
&gt; mind of God. It ain't going to happen :)
">

You suggest that time is an illusion, which is possible, but perhaps time is
a real thing, a part of objective reality. In relativity, time is a
dimension, and is part of the space/time continuum, a four-dimensional
structure. Exactly why we perceive an arrow of time remains something of a
mystery, I guess. But there are certain laws of physics, including the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, which are asymmetrical with respect to time.
The 2nd Law says that entropy never decreases as you move forward through
time, so in this case, time has a definite direction. (A lot of the other
laws would still hold true, if you effectively ran them backwards, if you
replaced t with -t in the equations.)

Along these lines, I was impressed by the tendency of the human
brain to confabulate (fabricate) in cases of brain trauma as discussed
in the video presentations here:

In a extreme case example, a woman was in denial of one side of
her body. She denied ownership of her left hand, for example.
When asked about the ring on the finger of her left hand, she
insisted that someone must have stolen her wedding ring.

Such extreme cases of obvious false beliefs and absolute denial
of contrary evidence are actually scary. One wonders about denial
of facts and confabulations produced in healthy brains since it
seems to be a characteristic of the brain to have a attititude
of &quot;Don't bother me with facts, my mind is made up&quot; :)

If I haven't misunderstood you, I'm inclined towards a similar view. The
distinction we make between perception and conception is a conceived
distinction that gives the misleading appearance of admitting of either one
in the absence of the other. I'm comfortable with the idea that for most
species of animal it is perception that is the dominant driver of behavior,
and that for our species conception plays a greater role, but I'm not
comfortable with the idea that perception and conception are as separable
as our thinking might lead us to believe. I'd be interested in any further
comments you may wish to offer.

Yes, there must certainly be similarities between human POVs that
would make them &quot;weakly identitical&quot;, otherwise they couldn't be
categorized as &quot;human&quot; to begin with (distinguishable from the POVs of
lions, eagles, lizards, etc).

Yet with each person having a different personal life-history, genetic
code, sometimes different culture, and existing at a different spot on
Earth at any given moment--it would seem extremely difficult to make a
case for strong or perfectly identical instances (even the epigenetics
of identical twins differ as they age). Still, physicist Max Tegmark
once argued in a Scientific American article that if the universe is
infinite, then it will start duplicating our local region at some
point quadrillions of light-years from here. That would include a
doppelganger for each of us with exactly the same thoughts (although
this might not be synchronous, because of relativity; i.e., my double
might have the same introspective experience I'm having now in the
past or future from my standpoint, due to curvature arising over great
distances).

If by that you mean that the two couldn't be separated without the
consequence of experience no longer &quot;existing&quot;, then there is an
historical precedent for that.

Part of the inspiration for Sellars' Myth of the Given can probably be
traced to Immanuel Kant back in late 1700s, who succinctly wrote:
&quot;Concepts without intuitions are empty, intuitions without concepts
are blind.&quot; (A51=B75). So in that sense, the two are co-dependent.

By &quot;intuitions&quot; he meant percepts of some kind, which would be better
regarded today as unconscious &quot;information&quot;, since otherwise we might
mistakenly regard Kant's &quot;intuitions&quot; to already be recognizable
phenomena before their synthesis with categorical templates.
Experience was not irreducible in Kant's philosophy of mind;
experience was the product of the merger of concepts and sensory
information.

In the Epistemology of Perception, here is how Daniel O'Brien
introduces empiricist foundationalism, its non-inferential &quot;Given&quot;,
and the challenge to it by Wilfrid Sellars and neo-pragmatists like
Richard Rorty back in the 20th century:

---- For empiricists, these foundations consist in your beliefs about
your own experience. Your beliefs are basic and non-basic. Your basic
beliefs comprise such beliefs as that you are now seeing a red shape
in your visual field, let us say, and that you are aware of a pungent
smell. [But] in order to justify your non-basic belief that Thierry
Henry is the best striker in Europe, you must be able to infer it from
other beliefs, say that he has scored the most goals.

The traditional foundationalist claim, however, is that this sort of
inferential justification is not required for your basic beliefs.
There may not actually be a red object in the world because you may be
hallucinating, but, nevertheless, you cannot be wrong about the fact
that you now believe that you am seeing something red. Justification
for such beliefs is provided by experiential states that are not
themselves beliefs, that is, by your immediate apprehension of the
content of your sensory, perceptual experience, or what is sometimes
termed, &quot;the Given&quot;.

It is, then, your experience of seeing red that justifies your belief
that you are seeing red. Such experience is non-conceptual. It is,
though, the raw material which you then go on to have conceptual
thoughts about. This conception of the relation between knowledge and
experience has had a distinguished history. It was advocated by the
British empiricists--Locke, Berkeley and Hume--and by the important
modern adherents C. I. Lewis (1946) and R. Chisholm (1989). However,
this conception of how your perceptual beliefs are justified has been
widely attacked, and the next two sections address the most
influential arguments against traditional foundationalism.

Sellars (1956) provides an extended critique of the notion of the
Given. There are two parts to Sellars' argument: first, he claims that
knowledge is part of the &quot;logical space of reasons;&quot; and second, he
provides an alternative account of &quot;looks talk,&quot; or an alternative
reading of such claims as &quot;that looks red to me,&quot; claims that
traditionally have been seen as infallible and as foundations for our
perceptual knowledge. According to Sellars, no cognitive states are
non-inferentially justified. For him:

The essential part is that in characterising an episode or a state as
that of knowing, we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of
justifying and being able to justify what one says.&quot; (Sellars, 1956,
p. 76)

Whether we are talking about perceptual or non-perceptual knowledge,
we must be able to offer reasons for why we take such claims to be
true. To even claim appropriately that I have knowledge that I now
seem to be seeing a red shape, I must be able to articulate such
reasons as, &quot;since my eyes are working fine, and the light is good, I
am right in thinking that I am having a certain sensory experience.&quot;
As Rorty (1979, chapter 4) argues, justification is essentially a
linguistic or &quot;conversational&quot; notion; it must consist in the reasoned
recognition of why a particular belief is likely to be true or why one
is rightly said to be having a certain experience. If such an account
of justification is correct, then the notion of non-inferentially
justified basic beliefs is untenable and non-conceptual perceptual
experience cannot provide the justification for our perceptual
beliefs. ----
