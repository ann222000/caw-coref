Didn't the image boffins at our national television and radio
services have a busy summer?

You can't move these days without finding the frightening image of
Close Up presenter Mark Sainsbury's moustache in your face; or his try-
hard intonation blaring out of the small screen telling us what a
remarkable bunch of people he works with. Someone should tell the
agency you can overplay sincerity.

Then there's this new National Radio thing, which also seems to
require the collusion of its editorial staff.

Fortunately, good journalists are sceptical. They have well-developed
flannel detectors. They know when they are being invited to conspire
in the grooming of their audiences.

So it was a relief to discover that at least one presenter at National
Radio - as it used to be called - possessed the independence and sense
of fun to take the mickey out of the broadcaster's brand-new
campaign.

And it was depressingly predictable that Kim Hill, by a tall head and
shoulders the most able radio journalist around, should be dressed
down as a result.

For those who gaily pay their taxes but who do not partake of the
dividend, those who are not regular listeners to our national
broadcasting service - a beacon of clarity and intelligence amid the
drivelling sound and fury of the airwaves - here's a brief recap.

Radio New Zealand decided to indulge in a rebranding exercise. As the
summer programming drew to a close and normal service was due to
resume there were coy allusions to imminent changes.

What we got were largely unaltered programme schedules and formats, no
discernible addition to the investigative or presenting firepower, but
the bright wrapping paper of new names, new logos, new slogans.
National Radio would become known as Radio New Zealand National, and
the Concert Programme as Radio New Zealand Concert.

Most audible amid the project was the new slogan accompanying the
recording of iconic New Zealand sounds: "sounds like us". The sounds
chosen to represent "us" were clips of the most wholesome, anodyne
kind: the Trentham races, the Picton ferry, the morning bird call, and
so on.

Whatever its intentions, the campaign sounded contrived. It cried out
for an explanation, or failing that a little deflation. In the absence
of the former it fell to Hill, at the end of the first week on her
Saturday morning show, to offer an oblique commentary on this ungainly
upstart.

This she did by employing a few unscheduled archetypal Kiwi sounds: a
chainsaw, sheep baaing, a non-starting lawnmower.

And we regular listeners to National Radio sniggered and hooted
conspiratorially with Hill and the rest of the kids at the back of the
class - a small and ultimately harmless pinprick of protest against
the powers-that-be who deign to patronise their audiences by spending
our money on telling us, in a highly selective manner, what or who we
sound like.

Radio New Zealand chief executive Peter Cavanagh subsequently told a
Sunday paper that there had been a "conversation with Kim" and that
the stunt had been "unhelpful" - apparently on the grounds that it
confused some listeners.

Most listeners are probably confused as to why no doubt large dollops
of cash have been spent on a cosmetic exercise when there are never
the resources to extend or invest in editorial services. And why Hill
should be rapped over the knuckles for turning a satirical penlight on
the campaign.

The role of journalists as watchdogs on their own organisations has
long been delicate, not to say problematic. Qualities such as honesty,
transparency, intelligence, independence, incisiveness and integrity
are trumpeted by media to persuade audiences of the superiority of
their "product".

When those qualities are then trained on the host they are abruptly
greeted by the iron fist of intolerance, or worse.

Hill is highly respected precisely because she possesses all these
attributes. And they are indeed the qualities that listeners ascribe
to the programmes she is associated with.

Management intervention and the resultant publicity, including the
suggestion that Hill had effectively now been nobbled, has to be
counter-productive.

Evidently more concerned about the successful deployment of the new
"brand" than in defending robust editorial independence, at a stroke
Cavanagh has demonstrated that the marketing-led corporatism now in
ascendancy in the private media sector also holds sway in our State-
owned broadcasters.

That may be the way of the world, but nobody, least of all a fearless
iconic broadcaster, should be diminished for pointing it out

Mr Cavanagh retains his position at National Radio because it is not
within my power to dismiss him. I seethe now each time I hear one of
these promos. And don't get me started on Mr Sainsbury's open pores,
visible on the back on a bus heading into the tunnel off the basin
here in Wellington the other day. Life size times ten. I don't think I
slept at all that night. Perhaps that's the unknown cause of the
traffic shambles in recent times?
