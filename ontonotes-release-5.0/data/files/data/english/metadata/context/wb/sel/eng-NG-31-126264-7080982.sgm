For the first time in the Bay Area, Don Tapscott --
one of the world's leading business strategists --
shares insights from his new best selling book
(co-author Anthony Williams) Wikinonics: How Mass
Collaboration Changes Everything.

The eLearning Forum, in co-sponsorship with Cisco
Systems, is pleased to invite you to a conversation
with Don Tapscott over lunch at Cisco Systems campus
on Tuesday, February 27th. This event promises to be a
stimulating discovery of the power of social
networking in a business context, with boundless
learning and knowledge sharing implications for all
organizations and those who help them to compete. For

Initial Reader Comments

"Wiknomics captures and explains the essential nature
of the next generation of the Internet -- how
collaboration and communication technologies are
democratizing the creation of value. An insightful and
engaging book." John Chambers, President and CEO Cisco
Systems

"I love this book. How counter-intuitive that
openness, peering, sharing, and acting globally would
become key to corporate competitiveness, growth and
profit? Mass collaboration is the most disruptive
development in business in a long time. Consider
Wikinomics your survival kit."  Ross Mayfield, CEO,
Socialtext

"Wikinomics heralds the biggest change in
collaboration to date. Thanks to the Internet, masses
of people outside the boundaries of traditional
hierarchies can innovate to produce content, goods and
services. In order to understand the opportunities
this presents for companies, read this book."  Eric
Schmidt, CEO Google
