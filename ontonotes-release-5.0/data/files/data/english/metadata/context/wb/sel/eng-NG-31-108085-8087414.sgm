Hi I am interested in rockets that can propel bicycles and skates to
relatively fast speeds.

I'm not planning to do such stunts but I want to apply them somewhere
else.

Can anyone tell me what kind of rocket did they use in JackAss 2 to
propel the bicycles up the ramp?
Is that an HTP rocket?

Do you guys know any website which can give me more information on
Hydrogen Peroxide (HTP) rockets?
Manufacturers that make these rockets available to the public market?

HTP (High Test Peroxide) rockets and HTP itself is not something
someone with little to no experience with high power rockets should be
working with.  HTP will decompose very energetically very quickly with
only a small amount of contaminate.  Also, there are only 2 real
methods of obtaining HTP, distilling it yourself (not recommended
unless you want to end your life early) or purchasing it.  Most places
that will sell HTP (H2O2 greater than 75% concentration) have a
minimum order of about 2000 pounds or so (some more, some less) and
will not sell to individuals, only companies.

If you're looking to accelerate an object (be it a rocket or a bike)
start small and work your way up.  You'll be surprised how difficult
it is(and dangerous for something like a bike)  They don't call it
rocket science for nothing.

I want an HTP rocket to help give some boost to my car for quarter-
mile drag racing.
The car will still have its small gasoline engine in stock form and
the HTP rockets will assist this internal combustion engine in
speeding up.

I'm not sure about the minimum here for Hydrogen Peroxide but I many
chemicals here in the Philippines are fairly easy to obtain.

Can anyone help me obtain more information on Hydrogen Peroxide
Rockets and how to make them or where to have those made?

I think it's really cool that drag racing is popular in the Philippines.

What track do you race at?

I would suggest you look at using nitrous oxide(NOS for most people in
the car industry) injection into the gasoline engine rather than HTP
rockets.  HTP rockets are not an easy or cheap method of going fast
and are very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

Call around to some industrial supply places and ask for 90% hydrogen
peroxide.  See what kind of response you get.  I doubt you'll be able
to buy it (I think you can't even buy normal solid rocket motors, but
I could be wrong)

Side bonus is they might enjoy installing the igniter..

Or use the tank of nitrous to drive a large hybrid. At least that can be
shut off early, should the need arise.

nah! drag racing isn't really that popular here because not many
people have the money and therefore can't afford expenses for such
sport.

We have a few drag racing strips here in places such as the Manila
Harbour Center, Batangas Racing Circuit and in a few AirBases.  Most
of the cars used for racing are Honda Civics.

We own a pharmaceutical company and we know a few chemical suppliers
who can possibly supply us with hydrogen peroxide or if they don't
have it then maybe they know someone who can help me obtain this
chemical.

The kind of HTP rocket I want to mount onto my drag car is the small
kind used in JackAss2.  not enough thrust to propel the car on its own
BUT would probably give the car a boost when working with the gasoline
engine.  I guess if it is safe enough for a bicycle, skates or a sled
then it would be of less danger to a driver with a farther distance
from the rocket.

rocket could possibly be mounted on the rear (inside the trunk) or on
the sides.  Mounts are welded onto the chassis.

I can't help you with the JackAss2 thing.  I would argue that it is

Spewing large amounts of steam out the back would however make for
great theatrics.

I have often thought that small APCP motors could be useful in
professional drag racing.  First, they could be an anti &quot;moon shot&quot;
safety feature.  Second they could provide needed down force moving
off the line at slow speed.  Dragsters have lots of HP and Torque
available but they can't put all of it to the wheels at the start or
they will just smoke the tires.  The tires thrust is limited by their
down force, or &quot;weight&quot;; let's say trust four times the down force. So
an extra kN of rocket down thrust could be an extra 4 kN of tire
thrust off the line.  As speed builds up, aerodynamic down force
builds up to the point that the tires can handle the full engine
torque.   At even faster speeds, tire trust diminishes by engine RPM
and HP limits.

But for a front wheel drive Honda Civic, just cut the weight to the
bone, add the safety equipment, use good tires and a strong engine.
The steam is just for theatrics.

actually that's one of the reasons I want a rocket motor assisting the
IC engine.
rocket thrust pushes through the air
while tires need a lot of traction/friction to overcome inertia.

thanks for mentioning &quot;Pelthead&quot;
I hope he can help me here.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actually that's one of the reasons I want a rocket motor assisting the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rocket thrust pushes through the air
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; while tires need a lot of traction/friction to overcome inertia.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for mentioning &quot;Pelthead&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actually that's one of the reasons I want a rocket motor
assisting the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; IC engine.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rocket thrust pushes through the air
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; while tires need a lot of traction/friction to overcome inertia.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for mentioning &quot;Pelthead&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope he can help me here.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Is &quot;Outhouses&quot; a person?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Most
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the cars used for racing are Honda Civics.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The kind of HTP rocket I want to mount onto my drag car is
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;small
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;kind used in JackAss2.  not enough thrust to propel the car
on its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;own
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;BUT would probably give the car a boost when working with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gasoline
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;engine.  I guess if it is safe enough for a bicycle, skates
or a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sled
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;then it would be of less danger to a driver with a farther
distance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from the rocket.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rocket could possibly be mounted on the rear (inside the
trunk) or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sides.  Mounts are welded onto the chassis.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't help you with the JackAss2 thing.  I would argue that
it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NOT save enough for bicycle, skates or a sled, or even a Honda
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Civic.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spewing large amounts of steam out the back would however make
for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great theatrics.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have often thought that small APCP motors could be useful in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; professional drag racing.  First, they could be an anti &quot;moon
shot&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; safety feature.  Second they could provide needed down force
moving
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the line at slow speed.  Dragsters have lots of HP and
Torque
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available but they can't put all of it to the wheels at the
start or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they will just smoke the tires.  The tires thrust is limited
by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;their
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down force, or &quot;weight&quot;; let's say trust four times the down
force.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an extra kN of rocket down thrust could be an extra 4 kN of
tire
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thrust off the line.  As speed builds up, aerodynamic down
force
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; builds up to the point that the tires can handle the full
engine
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; torque.   At even faster speeds, tire trust diminishes by
engine RPM
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and HP limits.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But for a front wheel drive Honda Civic, just cut the weight
to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bone, add the safety equipment, use good tires and a strong
engine.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The steam is just for theatrics.

Don't need to.  You caught me in a PC moment.  Don't worry it never
lasts more than a minute.
