I used &quot;spar varnish&quot;. Its a varnish designed for outside used, and is very
hard. It cannot be buffed out to a shine, the final coat must be sprayed. I
brushed about 8 coats on it, sanding between every coat and sprayed the last
two coats. I would have had a better finish if I had a spray booth to work
with. It turned out real well. but I can see the mistakes!!

The kid at Menards tried to sell me Thompson's deck stuff, I was trying to
tell him I needed it to shine.

Linseed oil ad paint thinner will give you a low maintenance finish that can
be renewed without much extra work

I suggest you thin the first coat of spar varnish, 50/50 with paint thinner.
It will soak into the wood deeper. The biggest killer of any clear finish is
ultraviolet rays and wood expansion/contraction. You can't do much about the
sun, so minimize the wood movement. Specify rift sawn or quarter sawn for
your oak. The movement of these cuts of wood moves less than flat sawn. The
clear finish fails when the wood moves, cracks the finish, then lets water
in. White oak is better than red oak. The tannin in oak doesn't do well with
water. It will stain black with contact with steel. Make sure the contact
with the inside of the bed has a good coat of paint on it. You might
consider some of the rain forrest alternatives for house decks. Ipe is one
of the wood that looks and is colored close to mahogany. This stuff is
incredibly hard and stable. A bit nontraditional, but it will last
forever!!!!

If you want a real high gloss, wet sand the final coat with 600 then 1200.
Then use something like 3M Finese It and a power buffer to bring out the
high shine. You will have to wait a couple of weeks after the final coat to
do this buffing though. Spar varnish stays somewhat flexible over it's life
to try and move with the wood.

You might also look into wood boat finish. I think they use something called
Dek Olje from Europe. It is supposed to have better chemistry than ordinary
spar varnish, but more hazardous as well.

Regards, Rich

I used WestSystem epoxy. The mix I used is highly UV resistant, tough as
nails, and will buff to a &quot;brightwork&quot; finish.
