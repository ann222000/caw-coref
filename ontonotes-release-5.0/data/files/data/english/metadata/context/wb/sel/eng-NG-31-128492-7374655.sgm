Facing jail, 'dying millionairess' who cheated her lovers out of
£100,000

Emma Golightly was a wealthy businesswoman
To the men she seduced, Emma Golightly was a wealthy businesswoman who
liked nothing more than to shower her lovers with top-of-the-range cars
and exotic holidays.

When soon afterwards she told them she was suffering from terminal
cancer, they invariably agreed to marry her.

One man, company director Chris Williams, walked down the aisle with
the 22-year-old weeks after she told him she 'didn't want to die
without being a bride'.

The truth, however, was that Golightly had no illness of the sort.
Neither was she the millionairess she claimed to be.

All the gifts the men had been receiving - as well as many she had
indulged in herself - had been paid for with their own credit cards.

The fantasist and serial bride was facing jail after admitting conning
at least three men out of more than £100,000. She asked for 60
offences of deception into consideration.

Golightly, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, used lonely hearts columns to
meet wealthy men and plunder their credit cards.

She even ripped off her own mother and grandmother to fund a lavish
lifestyle.

Her deceit was uncovered after her victims were confronted with huge
bills and called police.

Golightly had been due to be sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court this
week but the case was adjourned until January 30 after the sudden death
of her 19-year-old brother from a suspected heart attack. Her victims
spoke of their ordeals.

The husband

The heartfelt plea from his 'dying' girlfriend was something company
director Chris Williams could not resist and two days before Christmas
2004, the couple tied the knot at Gateshead Register Office at the end
of a whirlwind seven month affair.

She lied about her age on the wedding certificate, claiming she was 23
when she was 20, and a solicitor's daughter.

But it was the cancer ruse that was the cruellest of a string of lies
Golightly told the new husband she met via a lonely hearts newspaper
advert.

She told him they had been given a £500 wedding gift from her father
but in fact she had taken it from Mr Williams's bank account behind his
back.

Golightly insisted she would foot the £8,600 bill for their week-long
luxury honeymoon in Jamaica, which she put on his credit cards without
his knowledge - as was the £200 train tickets to get the couple to
Heathrow.

When later confronted by her new husband she admitted her deceit and
promised to pay him back but the £12,000 cheque she gave him later
bounced.

When she insisted on buying expensive Land Rover 4x4s for her husband
and mother three months after their marriage Golightly said she could
afford to pay for the vehicles out of savings and an inheritance.

The couple visited the car showroom and plumped for a £42,000 Land
Rover Discovery for Mr Williams,33, and he agreed to put down a £1,000
deposit.

Golightly brazenly told sales staff the balance would be paid by
electronic transfer and asked for a second £13,000 vehicle to be kept
in the showroom until Mothering Sunday as a surprise for her parent.

Once she got her hand on both cars the electronic transfers never
happened and Golightly's cheques invariably bounced.

In April 2005 Mr Williams ordered his wife out of his home. 'It was a
bad time in my life and I'd rather not talk about it,' he said.

The Bridegroom

Undaunted, Golightly turned her attentions on to a broadcasting
executive from Heaton, once again callously playing the cancer card.

Despite legally still being Mrs Williams, she even arranged to 'marry'
her unsuspecting boyfriend - who she met on the internet - at
Newcastle's Copthorne Hotel in October 2005, a month later.

She was calling herself Chelsea Taylor this time and his friends were
already trying to ring alarm bells.

One said:' She told him she only had six months to live. He said he
would rather have that short time with her than not at all and so they
were bringing the wedding forward.'

Golightly claimed she was part-owner of a Gateshead club and running
her own successful wedding dress company but, unknown to her boyfriend,
it was his credit card she was using to pay for their big day.

After the happy couple posed on the banks of the River Tyne it soon
became obvious that things were not going to plan. The chauffeur
refused to leave until he had been paid and the registrar failed to
appear.

One guest said:'My friend was stressed beyond belief and just wanted to
marry the woman he was in love with and for her to be happy.

'To everyone's relief, one of the guests, who was a lay preacher,
offered to do a "blessing".' Golightly's 'cancer' drugs were later
tested and turned out to be antihistamine tablets and an
antidepressant.

Her 'husband-to-be' threw her out when he realised the extent of her
lies - and called the police when credit cards bills began to arrive.

The business partner

A third victim was duped into believing he was part-owner of a
Newcastle bar with Golightly, who he met on the internet .

Half was in his name, Golightly told the man she had bombarded with
gifts, before confiding that she was suffering from cancer which, if
terminal, meant the whole business was his.

The couple arranged a romantic trip together in Egypt which she said
she had paid for but when they turned up at Newcastle Airport there
were no tickets - and no holiday.

Within a short time the man realised he had been hoodwinked , and his
credit cards plundered.

The date

Another Tyneside man had a date with Golightly through a website called
Dating Direct but decided she was as 'nutty as a fruitcake' and never
saw her again.

A 'Chelsea' on the website describes herself as a 28 year old, divorced
'light blonde attractive' designer with a Masters degree and a wide
range of interests - but posts no photograph.

Her date said:' When we met she wasn't what I expected but she
certainly had the gift of the gab. She told me about her work as a
leading oncologist. She talked about her great house and car, her
horses. She had great imagination, she was never stumped for an answer
or lost for words.'
