<P>It appears another memo has popped up that squashes the left's
screaming and crying about the "downing street" memo: WASHINGTON, June
12 - A memorandum written by Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet office
in late July 2002 explicitly states that the Bush administration had
made "no political decisions" to invade Iraq, but that American military
planning for the possibility was advanced. The memo also said American
planning, in the eyes of Mr. Blair's aides, was "virtually silent" on
the problems of a postwar occupation. "A postwar occupation of Iraq
could lead to a protracted and costly nation-building exercise," warned
the memorandum, prepared July 21 for a meeting with Mr. Blair a few days
later. It also appeared to take as a given the presence of illicit
weapons in Iraq - an assumption that later proved almost entirely wrong
- and warned that merely removing Saddam Hussein from power would not
guarantee that those weapons could be secured. It's actually quite
humorous how silly the left can be. They think they have a smoking gun
with a memo from Britian. They are all screaming "he planned it all
along!" But then why would he go to the UN twice? Why would he give
Saddam the chance to flee and prevent the war? Why not just invade
without doing either if his mindset was only on this: (via The Captain )
Two days later, a separate analysis was presented to the same group of
people by "C" in the Downing Street Memo , indicating nothing about
sources or what level of officials with whom this MI-6 agent spoke to
reach the conclusions: C reported on his recent talks in Washington.
There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen
as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action,
justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence
and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience
with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the
Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the
aftermath after military action. And yet, in the end, despite C's
analysis of the attitude at the NSC, Bush did go through the "UN route"
-- twice. Both times, despite C's report to the British cabinet of a
lack of enthusiasm for the task, the American government made detailed
presentations on the Iraqi regime's record as well as the intelligence
on hand, most of which predated the Bush administration, especially the
humint which stopped with the 1998 suspension of weapons inspections. In
fact, just about everything in C's analysis was proven incorrect by
later events. The DSM isn't the minutes of a meeting between C and
American officials; it is the minutes of a British cabinet meeting where
he presented his analysis, which turned out to be thoroughly incorrect,
and which conflicted with other intelligence analysis. By the way, The
Captain is calling this new memo the Emily Litella Memo after that
famous character Gilda Radner did on SNL many years back....I love it.
The moonbats won't listen to this and are already crying "but this is
just a memo to prepare for a meeting, not minutes from a meeting". We
have all learned that they listen to nothing that doesn't support their
schizophrenic conspiracies. We could tell them that regime change has
been the policy of the US since 1998: SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS
REGARDING UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD IRAQ. It should be the policy of
the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by
Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a
democratic government to replace that regime." but that wouldn't matter
to them since their mindset is only on one thing: get Bush. They will
not be successful, the lunatic left has been exposed for quite some time
now and they are only making things worse for themselves. Man these
idiots can be so damn funny. Check out JustOneMinute for more. Below is
the full text of the new memo : PERSONAL SECRET UK EYES ONLY IRAQ:
CONDITIONS FOR MILITARY ACTION (A Note by Officials) Summary Ministers
are invited to: (1) Note the latest position on US military planning and
timescales for possible action. (2) Agree that the objective of any
military action should be a stable and law-abiding Iraq, within present
borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer posing
a threat to its neighbours or international security, and abiding by its
international obligations on WMD. (3) Agree to engage the US on the need
to set military plans within a realistic political strategy, which
includes identifying the succession to Saddam Hussein and creating the
conditions necessary to justify government military action, which might
include an ultimatum for the return of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq.
This should include a call from the Prime Minister to President Bush
ahead of the briefing of US military plans to the President on 4 August.
(4) Note the potentially long lead times involved in equipping UK Armed
Forces to undertake operations in the Iraqi theatre and agree that the
MOD should bring forward proposals for the procurement of Urgent
Operational Requirements under cover of the lessons learned from
Afghanistan and the outcome of SR2002. (5) Agree to the establishment of
an ad hoc group of officials under Cabinet Office Chairmanship to
consider the development of an information campaign to be agreed with
the US. Introduction 1. The US Government's military planning for action
against Iraq is proceeding apace. But, as yet, it lacks a political
framework. In particular, little thought has been given to creating the
political conditions for military action, or the aftermath and how to
shape it. 2. When the Prime Minister discussed Iraq with President Bush
at Crawford in April he said that the UK would support military action
to bring about regime change, provided that certain conditions were met:
efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion, the
Israel-Palestine Crisis was quiescent, and the options for action to
eliminate Iraq's WMD through the UN weapons inspectors had been
exhausted. 3. We need now to reinforce this message and to encourage the
US Government to place its military planning within a political
framework, partly to forestall the risk that military action is
precipitated in an unplanned way by, for example, an incident in the No
Fly Zones. This is particularly important for the UK because it is
necessary to create the conditions in which we could legally support
military action. Otherwise we face the real danger that the US will
commit themselves to a course of action which we would find very
difficult to support. 4. In order to fulfil the conditions set out by
the Prime Minister for UK support for military action against Iraq,
certain preparations need to be made, and other considerations taken
into account. This note sets them out in a form which can be adapted for
use with the US Government. Depending on US intentions, a decision in
principle may be needed soon on whether and in what form the UK takes
part in military action. The Goal 5. Our objective should be a stable
and law-abiding Iraq, within present borders, co-operating with the
international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or
to international security, and abiding by its international obligations
on WMD. It seems unlikely that this could be achieved while the current
Iraqi regime remains in power. US military planning unambiguously takes
as its objective the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime, followed by
elimination if Iraqi WMD. It is however, by no means certain, in the
view of UK officials, that one would necessarily follow from the other.
Even if regime change is a necessary condition for controlling Iraqi
WMD, it is certainly not a sufficient one. US Military Planning 6.
Although no political decisions have been taken, US military planners
have drafted options for the US Government to undertake an invasion of
Iraq. In a 'Running Start', military action could begin as early as
November of this year, with no overt military build-up. Air strikes and
support for opposition groups in Iraq would lead initially to
small-scale land operations, with further land forces deploying
sequentially, ultimately overwhelming Iraqi forces and leading to the
collapse of the Iraqi regime. A 'Generated Start' would involve a longer
build-up before any military action were taken, as early as January
2003. US military plans include no specifics on the strategic context
either before or after the campaign. Currently the preference appears to
be for the 'Running Start'. CDS will be ready to brief Ministers in more
detail. 7. US plans assume, as a minimum, the use of British bases in
Cyprus and Diego Garcia. This means that legal base issues would arise
virtually whatever option Ministers choose with regard to UK
participation. The Viability of the Plans 8. The Chiefs of Staff have
discussed the viability of US military plans. Their initial view is that
there are a number of questions which would have to be answered before
they could assess whether the plans are sound. Notably these include the
realism of the 'Running Start', the extent to which the plans are proof
against Iraqi counter-attack using chemical or biological weapons and
the robustness of US assumptions about the bases and about Iraqi
(un)willingness to fight. UK Military Contribution 9. The UK's ability
to contribute forces depends on the details of the US military planning
and the time available to prepare and deploy them. The MOD is examining
how the UK might contribute to US-led action. The options range from
deployment of a Division (ie Gulf War sized contribution plus naval and
air forces) to making available bases. It is already clear that the UK
could not generate a Division in time for an operation in January 2003,
unless publicly visible decisions were taken very soon. Maritime and air
forces could be deployed in time, provided adequate basing arrangements
could be made. The lead times involved in preparing for UK military
involvement include the procurement of Urgent Operational Requirements,
for which there is no financial provision. The Conditions Necessary for
Military Action 10. Aside from the existence of a viable military plan
we consider the following conditions necessary for military action and
UK participation: justification/legal base; an international coalition;
a quiescent Israel/Palestine; a positive risk/benefit assessment; and
the preparation of domestic opinion. Justification 11. US views of
international law vary from that of the UK and the international
community. Regime change per se is not a proper basis for military
action under international law. But regime change could result from
action that is otherwise lawful. We would regard the use of force
against Iraq, or any other state, as lawful if exercised in the right of
individual or collective self-defence, if carried out to avert an
overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe, or authorised by the UN Security
Council. A detailed consideration of the legal issues, prepared earlier
this year, is at Annex A. The legal position would depend on the precise
circumstances at the time. Legal bases for an invasion of Iraq are in
principle conceivable in both the first two instances but would be
difficult to establish because of, for example, the tests of immediacy
and proportionality. Further legal advice would be needed on this point.
12. This leaves the route under the UNSC resolutions on weapons
inspectors. Kofi Annan has held three rounds of meetings with Iraq in an
attempt to persuade them to admit the UN weapons inspectors. These have
made no substantive progress; the Iraqis are deliberately obfuscating.
Annan has downgraded the dialogue but more pointless talks are possible.
We need to persuade the UN and the international community that this
situation cannot be allowed to continue ad infinitum. We need to set a
deadline, leading to an ultimatum. It would be preferable to obtain
backing of a UNSCR for any ultimatum and early work would be necessary
to explore with Kofi Annan and the Russians, in particular, the scope
for achieving this. 13. In practice, facing pressure of military action,
Saddam is likely to admit weapons inspectors as a means of forestalling
it. But once admitted, he would not allow them to operate freely.
UNMOVIC (the successor to UNSCOM) will take at least six months after
entering Iraq to establish the monitoring and verification system under
Resolution 1284 necessary to assess whether Iraq is meeting its
obligations. Hence, even if UN inspectors gained access today, by
January 2003 they would at best only just be completing setting up. It
is possible that they will encounter Iraqi obstruction during this
period, but this more likely when they are fully operational. 14. It is
just possible that an ultimatum could be cast in terms which Saddam
would reject (because he is unwilling to accept unfettered access) and
which would not be regarded as unreasonable by the international
community. However, failing that (or an Iraqi attack) we would be most
unlikely to achieve a legal base for military action by January 2003. An
International Coalition 15. An international coalition is necessary to
provide a military platform and desirable for political purposes. 16. US
military planning assumes that the US would be allowed to use bases in
Kuwait (air and ground forces), Jordan, in the Gulf (air and naval
forces) and UK territory (Diego Garcia and our bases in Cyprus). The
plans assume that Saudi Arabia would withhold co-operation except
granting military over-flights. On the assumption that military action
would involve operations in the Kurdish area in the North of Iraq, the
use of bases in Turkey would also be necessary. 17. In the absence of UN
authorisation, there will be problems in securing the support of NATO
and EU partners. Australia would be likely to participate on the same
basis as the UK. France might be prepared to take part if she saw
military action as inevitable. Russia and China, seeking to improve
their US relations, might set aside their misgivings if sufficient
attention were paid to their legal and economic concerns. Probably the
best we could expect from the region would be neutrality. The US is
likely to restrain Israel from taking part in military action. In
practice, much of the international community would find it difficult to
stand in the way of the determined course of the US hegemon. However,
the greater the international support, the greater the prospects of
success. A Quiescent Israel-Palestine 18. The Israeli re-occupation of
the West Bank has dampened Palestinian violence for the time being but
is unsustainable in the long-term and stoking more trouble for the
future. The Bush speech was at best a half step forward. We are using
the Palestinian reform agenda to make progress, including a resumption
of political negotiations. The Americans are talking of a ministerial
conference in November or later. Real progress towards a viable
Palestinian state is the best way to undercut Palestinian extremists and
reduce Arab antipathy to military action against Saddam Hussein.
However, another upsurge of Palestinian/Israeli violence is highly
likely. The co-incidence of such an upsurge with the preparations for
military action against Iraq cannot be ruled out. Indeed Saddam would
use continuing violence in the Occupied Territories to bolster popular
Arab support for his regime. Benefits/Risks 19. Even with a legal base
and a viable military plan, we would still need to ensure that the
benefits of action outweigh the risks. In particular, we need to be sure
that the outcome of the military action would match our objective as set
out in paragraph 5 above. A post-war occupation of Iraq could lead to a
protracted and costly nation-building exercise. As already made clear,
the US military plans are virtually silent on this point. Washington
could look to us to share a disproportionate share of the burden.
Further work is required to define more precisely the means by which the
desired endstate would be created, in particular what form of Government
might replace Saddam Hussein's regime and the timescale within which it
would be possible to identify a successor. We must also consider in
greater detail the impact of military action on other UK interests in
the region. Domestic Opinion 20. Time will be required to prepare public
opinion in the UK that it is necessary to take military action against
Saddam Hussein. There would also need to be a substantial effort to
secure the support of Parliament. An information campaign will be needed
which has to be closely related to an overseas information campaign
designed to influence Saddam Hussein, the Islamic World and the wider
international community. This will need to give full coverage to the
threat posed by Saddam Hussein, including his WMD, and the legal
justification for action. Timescales 21. Although the US military could
act against Iraq as soon as November, we judge that a military campaign
is unlikely to start until January 2003, if only because of the time it
will take to reach consensus in Washington. That said, we judge that for
climactic reasons, military action would need to start by January 2003,
unless action were deferred until the following autumn. 22. As this
paper makes clear, even this timescale would present problems. This
means that: (a) We need to influence US consideration of the military
plans before President Bush is briefed on 4 August, through contacts
betweens the Prime Minister and the President and at other levels;</P>
