Hi all,

I'm looking for any tips or information on feeding cats with different
nutritional requirements.

I've got a 14 year-old Siamese who grazes throughout the day on Senior's
High Fibre food. In a few weeks time there will be two new Devon Rex
kittens. I'm sure these little ones are going to be gluttons and they'll
also need special kitten food. Separating them is not an option as the
older cat grazes throughout the day.

The older Siamese's partner has recently passed, but he wore a device on his
collar that controlled the catdoor for outside. Is there a similar device
that operates motorized cover's on dishes so only the appropriate dish will
open during feedings, or can someone suggest something a little less
technical?

Thanks for anyone's help.
