Hi,
Could anyone provide any suggestions on refurbishing bakelite. I have a
telephone that I would like to shine up. Any suggestions would be
greatly appreciated. This is the first time I have visited this
newsgroup so please accept my apology if I have incorrectly posted this
request here.
Thanks
Nathan

Nathan - I asked a radio collector friend of mine and he suggested a product
called 'Novus.' It is a mild abrasive polish specifically designed to
polish various plastics and comes in two grades, fine &amp; rough. He has used
it on Bakelite radio cases and tells me that radio collector friends of his
have used it on Bakelite telephone parts. All he uses is the fine and he
reports that it does not damage the surface [knowing what an anal nut he his
[no disrespect - all us collectors are], I have to believe he would not risk
damage to his &quot;beauties.&quot;

Anyway it is available at Antique Electronic Supply In Tempe, Arizona - and
I imagine over the net somewhere.

Good luck,
Lazlo

PS - If Ashley makes a suggestion, politely accept it and then ignore it.
Beware!

"/> Hi Nathan, This past weekend, at Brimfield, I saw some bakelite buckets with
handles. Wacky! Cool! But scratched. The woman selling them said
that you can refurbish bakelite by buffing it with a buffer. I do not have a
buffer (electric one) and I was not sure she was correct, although she carried
a ton of bakelite. But if it could be done so easily why hadn't she done it
already? Anyway, I didn't buy the buckets but now I kind of wish I had.
I mean, come on......how often do they come along?
See ya! Fayette

Another way to shine bakelite/catalin is to use auto compound

Jeez! It was a [bad] joke [expected only to be noticed by the regulars]
referencing the scrubbing bubbles and, SINCERELY, not meant to be a slam -
just a joke.

If anything, your comments, advice and help have been only an asset to the
group. NO ONE [except maybe someone reading that one post {which, by the
way, is many weeks old!}] would ever think less.

Your biggest fan,
Lazlo

Dear Lazlo,

Thank you for clearing that up. I had hoped you were referring to my big
mistake some months past. However, for people new to this newsgroup, they
wouldn't know about that and as you are one of the most respected members of
this group, would start to think all my advice wasn't worth the paper it is
written on. &lt;big g&gt;.

Most Sincerely,

Ashley

As mentioned by someone else, auto supply places sell materials good for
cleaning up plastics. I bought a CZ surplus pistol with grips that
resemble bakelite, one panel has a lot of the reinforcement threads
exposed on the surface and looked hideous so I sought out a way to make
it less iratating to look at. Specific products I used were
1. (Eagle 1 One) Ultra Fine SCRATCH REMOVER &amp; Polishing Compound.
2. (Black Magic) Trim &amp; Tire Shine. (Super Thick Silicone,no water)
Improvement in appearance justified the expense &amp; effort for my use.
Design of the grip, fit of grip to my hand, and non competitive range
only use of this gun does not result in a compromise of utility for
appearance. It's been maybe 18 months, grips still look good. The
silicone finish may partialy fill/darken pits that a wax finish would
highlight.

Ashley is most obviously a keen observer of the human condition [as well as
a respected raconteur in her own right] with razor sharp insight into the
value of one's contributions. Whilst I have been with you only these scant
few weeks [coming at the end of the Great Migration], it has been my
pleasure to make the occasional modest contribution. These contributions
have been seen, and analyzed, by Ashley and commended for the true value
they represent. This has garnered me the unilateral plaudit as &quot;one the
most respected members of this group&quot; - an honorarium which I am proud to
accept.

Yours in gracious humility,
Lazlo the beard

Anyhoo, here's something I tried at a friend's house on a bakelite piece
(I think it was a radio). There was a square spot that wasn't shiny and
he said there had been a gummed label on the item when he bought it. He
had managed to get the label off, but in the process the shine had left
as well. I said, &quot;Let me show you a trick&quot;; I rubbed the tip of one
finger across my forehead (which was a little sweaty), then rubbed the
spot with that finger. A little rubbing and the dull spot was gone! It
just floored my friend!
