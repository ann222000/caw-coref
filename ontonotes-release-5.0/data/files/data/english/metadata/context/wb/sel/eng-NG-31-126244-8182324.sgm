Exchange-Traded Funds
Before You Drive That Hot ETF...
They're spiffy and alluring, but an owner's manual is essential for novices
By ELEANOR LAISE

(See Corrections &amp; Amplifications item below.)

What you don't understand about exchange-traded funds could hurt you.

Think of it like a typical suburban minivan driver put behind the wheel of a
Formula One race car. Small investors trading their steady-Eddie mutual
funds for souped-up exchange-traded funds are in a similar situation. They
understand the vehicle's basic operation, but they may not be able to use it
to its full potential, and they could be tempted into reckless moves.

Many small investors already understand that ETFs are much like
index-tracking mutual funds yet trade on an exchange like a stock, and that
they generally charge much lower expenses than conventional mutual funds.

But there is much more to know about these relatively new funds, which, like
race cars, contain complex machinery in a sleek, simple package.

To start with, the expense advantages aren't always as great as they appear
at first glance. Beyond the brokerage-firm commission to buy ETF shares,
there are more-complicated trading costs. In addition, while ETFs are
similar to index mutual funds, they follow a wide assortment of complex
benchmarks that can mean very different risks and rewards for investors.

Since many of these funds are brand new, they aren't truly road-tested. The
back-tested performance data used to sell these products are sort of like
those car commercials where vehicles are put through their paces by a
professional driver on a closed track.

As the ETF industry booms, with assets now totaling about $480 billion in
500 offerings, it is becoming crucial for small investors to understand
these funds' inner workings. Here follows an owner's manual for ETF
investors, drawing on freshly crunched data and new research by Morgan
Stanley and Morningstar Inc., among others.

No. 1. ETFs are cheap -- but aren't always the cheapest investment option.

The expense ratio, which represents the percentage of fund assets deducted
each year to cover management fees and other costs, takes a bite out of
investors' returns. The ETFs with the lowest costs are often those tracking
broad, well-known U.S. stock-market indexes. Vanguard Group Inc.'s Vanguard
Total Stock Market ETF, for instance, charges a 0.07% annual expense
ratio -- or $7 for every $10,000 invested.

But many ETFs aren't rock-bottom cheap. In fact, so many new ETFs have hit
the market recently with higher fees that the average expense ratio for a
U.S. stock ETF has jumped 21% just over the past three months -- to 0.52% of
assets, up from 0.43%, according to Morgan Stanley.

Amvescap PLC's PowerShares Capital Management unit, one fast-growing ETF
provider, charges 0.60% for most of its industry-focused ETFs, including
PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio, PowerShares Dynamic Energy Sector
Portfolio and PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio. XShares Group LLC's
HealthShares lineup of health-care and biotechnology ETFs costs 0.75%. At
the higher end, charging 0.95%, are some leveraged ETFs and those that make
bearish bets against stocks, including ProShare Advisors LLC's Ultra S&amp;P 500
ProShares and Short S&amp;P500 ProShares.

The ProShare ETFs, many of which aim to deliver double an index's
performance on a daily basis, are more expensive because they &quot;require a
specialized level of knowledge and skills to run,&quot; says Michael Sapir,
chairman and chief executive of ProShare Advisors. He adds that the ETFs are
cheaper than comparable mutual funds. Jeff Feldman, chairman of XShares
Group, says the HealthShares ETFs, which are composed largely of smaller
companies, are &quot;more difficult to put together,&quot; and the funds' relatively
small size means that their asset-based expenses will be higher.

To be sure, all these ETFs are still cheap compared with the 1.42% levied by
the average diversified U.S. stock mutual fund. But more than 600 no-load
U.S. stock mutual funds sold to small investors offer at least one share
class charging 0.95% or less, according to a search by Morningstar of its
database of roughly 3,280 U.S. stock mutual funds. Some are index funds, as
those tend to be the least expensive funds in the mutual-fund world, but
hundreds of funds run by stock pickers also made the cut.

Among these: Vanguard Windsor, which charges 0.36% a year and delivered an
average annual 11.4% return in the five years ended May 29, beating the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index by more than two percentage points.

No. 2. ETFs have layers of complex trading costs.

A big appeal of ETFs is that they can be traded throughout the day on a
stock exchange, just like a stock and unlike a mutual fund, which is
typically priced just once a day, when markets close at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
The brokerage commission that investors typically pay to buy or sell an ETF
is fairly straightforward. Sometimes, it can be less than $10 a trade.

Murkier is the bid-ask spread. An investor buys an ETF at the &quot;ask&quot; price
and ultimately sells at the &quot;bid&quot; price, incurring a cost equal to the
difference between the two prices. So an investor wants as small a spread as
possible. Think of it as another trading cost, like a brokerage commission.

In general, funds that hold heavily traded stocks and track well-known
indexes tend to have narrower bid-ask spreads. ETFs focused on less heavily
traded market segments or that track more-exotic indexes often have larger
spreads.

Among U.S. stock ETFs, for example, the fund with the biggest spread in the
six months ended April 30 was First Trust Portfolios LP's First Trust DB
Strategic Value Index, according to XTF Global Asset Management, which
tracks, rates and builds portfolios of ETFs. That fund, which tracks the
obscure Deutsche Bank CROCI US+ Index, a benchmark composed of large-cap
U.S. stocks, had an average spread of 0.64% of its share price, or roughly
16 cents, based on the fund's recent $25 share price. That means that, on
top of the fund's 0.65% expense ratio and the brokerage commission paid to
buy and sell, an investor trading the fund at typical market prices over
that period may have sacrificed an additional 0.64% of his or her investment
to trading costs.

According to First Trust's own data, the ETF's spread over a more recent
period -- the year to date -- has averaged just over 7 cents, says First
Trust Senior Vice President Dan Waldron. &quot;There are no liquidity issues with
this basket of securities,&quot; he says.

In contrast, State Street Global Advisors' S&amp;P 500-tracking Standard &amp;
Poor's Depositary Receipts, or SPDR, had an average bid-ask spread over the
six-month period amounting to less than 0.01% of its share price, according
to XTF.

Investors can visit XTF's free Web site xtf.com to learn more about bid-ask
spreads. The site shows an average bid/ask ratio for each ETF, reflecting
the bid-ask spread as a fraction of the ETF's price over the past six
months, and ranks each ETF's bid/ask ratio against other funds in its
category.

No. 3. The variety of ETFs on the market means investors have plenty of
choice -- and plenty of room for confusion.

Two ETFs that appear nearly identical on the surface may pursue quite
different strategies, meaning different returns and risks for investors.
While the same may be said of conventional mutual funds, &quot;there has been
more experimentation&quot; in the ETF market lately, says Sonya Morris, a
Morningstar analyst.

A big positive for ETFs is that, unlike mutual funds, they generally publish
their holdings each day, so investors have the ability to determine exactly
what's inside their fund. That is why a lot of financial planners, trying to
allocate clients' money precisely across various asset classes, like them.
Mutual funds, by contrast, are required to disclose their holdings only four
times a year.

Consider that Barclays Global Investors' iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index
ETF gained 83% last year, while PowerShares Golden Dragon Halter USX China
Portfolio ETF gained 55%. A big reason for the performance difference: The
iShares ETF tracks an index of 25 Chinese companies that trade on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange, and roughly 40% of its assets are in financial stocks.
The PowerShares ETF tracks an index of U.S.-listed companies that get most
of their sales from China; only about 5% of its assets are in the financial
sector.

ETFs tracking the biggest U.S. stocks also show great variety. Take the
iShares S&amp;P 500 Index ETF, which returned 13.6% a year on average in the
three years ended May 23, and Rydex Investments' Rydex S&amp;P Equal Weight ETF,
which returned 16.9% a year on average over that period.

The performance gap springs from the different weighting schemes employed by
the two ETFs. The iShares fund tracks the traditional S&amp;P 500, in which
stocks' weightings are determined by their market valuation, while the Rydex
fund weights all of the S&amp;P 500 stocks equally.

Many other ETFs use an approach known as fundamental indexing, meaning
stocks are weighted on the basis of such measures as dividends or revenue.
That strategy often gives funds a &quot;value&quot; tilt, meaning they favor shares
deemed inexpensive on the basis of such things as price/earnings ratios. For
the past seven years in the U.S., value stocks outperformed &quot;growth&quot;
stocks -- those of companies with rapidly expanding earnings -- giving
value-tilted indexes an edge.

No. 4. An index-tracking fund doesn't always track its index well.

To run a portfolio that delivers the exact same return as an index requires
skill, starting with the decision of how closely a fund's holdings should
reflect its benchmark.

Some funds buy exactly the same stocks and maintain the same weightings as
the underlying index. Matthew Hougan, editor of IndexUniverse.com, an
index-industry Web site, noted in a recent report that such funds may have
higher trading costs but lower tracking error, after fees. Other funds buy
only a portion of the index's stocks in order to lower trading costs, but
this raises the risk of tracking error, Mr. Hougan wrote.

ETF tracking error is on the rise. Among U.S. major-market ETFs, the average
tracking error in 2006 was 0.29 percentage point, up from 0.18 percentage
point the year before, according to Morgan Stanley.

One reason: ETFs have become increasingly specialized. Narrower funds
sometimes can't mirror their indexes precisely or they would run afoul of
Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring funds to stay
diversified. Those rules say a fund must invest no more than 25% of assets
in a single holding and no more than half of assets in holdings with
weightings of 5% or more.

In the Dow Jones U.S. Telecommunications Index, for example, AT&amp;T Inc. has a
roughly 50% weighting. But because of the SEC's requirements, AT&amp;T shares
represent only about 20% of Barclays's iShares Dow Jones U.S.
Telecommunications Sector Index ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones index. The
iShares ETF's tracking error was roughly 4.5 percentage points last year,
according to Morgan Stanley.

&quot;Not even close,&quot; Mr. Hougan says.

&quot;The fund manager is going to do his best to have a limited amount of
tracking error,&quot; but given the diversification requirements, &quot;4% is the best
you can do,&quot; says Christine Hudacko, spokeswoman for Barclays.

In its study of major ETF providers' tracking error for 2006, Morgan Stanley
found a link between fees and a fund's ability to track its index. Vanguard
ETFs, which had the lowest average fees, had the lowest average tracking
error, 0.28 percentage point. In one of the best showings, Vanguard
Small-Cap Growth ETF deviated from its index by just 0.01 percentage point,
according to Morgan Stanley.

PowerShares ETFs, which had the highest average fees, also had the highest
average tracking error: 0.71 percentage point.

The PowerShares ETFs have higher tracking error largely because they often
invest in stocks that are difficult to trade and are rebalanced frequently,
not because they have higher fees, says Managing Director John Southard.

Some exchange-traded vehicles have a unique structure that cuts investors'
risk of tracking error. Barclays last year launched exchange-traded notes,
which are designed to give investors the return of benchmarks such as the
MSCI India Total Return Index, minus fees. But investors in these vehicles
take on some credit risk -- albeit very slight -- as the notes are debt
issued by Barclays Bank PLC.

No. 5. Many ETFs lack genuine performance histories.

While ETFs generally offer up long-term index track records, these figures
often are hypothetical, &quot;back-tested&quot; performance rather than true market
returns. A fund's strong back-tested record &quot;is no guarantee it will perform
well in the real world,&quot; Morningstar's Ms. Morris says.

The strong back-tests for some indexes tracked by fundamentally weighted
ETFs like WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend, for example, reflect the strength of
value stocks over the past seven years, Morgan Stanley found in its recent
research. But the S&amp;P 500 topped those value-oriented indexes in the late
1990s when growth stocks led the market -- and soon could lead again, if
many financial advisers are correct that the reign of value stocks has
neared its end.

While WisdomTree's dividend-weighted ETFs &quot;will lag if the market gets
speculative,&quot; the market has consistently awarded a premium to value stocks
over time, and dividend-paying stocks help to reduce the volatility of a
portfolio, says WisdomTree Investments Inc. president Bruce Lavine.

Another caveat on back-tested results: They don't factor in trading costs,
which include commissions paid to buy or sell stocks, as well as &quot;market
impact,&quot; which refers to the way a fund may move a stock's price by
attempting to buy or sell it.

&quot;I don't think you can question back-tested results enough,&quot; Mr. Hougan
says.

No. 6. Some ETFs may be fit for hedge funds and other high rollers, but not
for small investors.

While many financial advisers and investment professionals admire ETFs for
their low costs and broad diversification, a number of newly launched ETFs
don't quite fit that description.

&quot;There's a lot of junk coming out, truthfully,&quot; says Jeff Buetow, chief
investment officer at XTF. &quot;Many of these things are not well diversified,
and they're charging silly fees.&quot;

A slew of narrowly focused ETFs have been launched in recent months. Many
financial advisers feel such funds are a gamble, not a long-term investment.

Fund companies also have a habit of launching ETFs in go-go market segments
that may deliver eye-popping results in the short term but fizzle over the
long haul. &quot;ETFs can be very alluring to performance-chasers, and a lot of
the new rollouts have been in hot market areas,&quot; Ms. Morris says. &quot;That
panders to investors' worst instincts.&quot;

Narrow ETFs can make sense as a small part of a diversified portfolio.
Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group recommends that clients
devote a small slice of their cash allocation to Rydex's CurrencyShares Euro
Trust. The fund offers &quot;a very cheap way&quot; for small investors to access the
currency market, which has traditionally been the domain of professional
investors, says David Darst, chief investment strategist for the Global
Wealth Management Group.

The rapid growth of the ETF industry also means that &quot;a lot of people think
we're in a bubble phase,&quot; says Mr. Hougan, the IndexUniverse.com editor.
&quot;Some of these funds may not stick, and you don't want to be caught holding
a fund that has to be liquidated.&quot; If a fund shuts down, investors may face
a tax bill and be forced to pay additional commissions in order to shift to
new holdings.
