My experience with &quot;clay&quot; pipes such as these is the commemorative type.
The one I am most familiar with is actually a Henry Clay [surely made as a
play-on-words] pipe, made in 1844 as a presidential election item for [Whig]
Clay's unsuccessful run against democrat James Polk. They turn up fairly
frequently at political ephemera shows and run in the US$200 range.

I believe [no true knowledge] that they were made in the British isles and,
in addition to use at home, were exported to the US. I was told a story
[myth, legend or fact] that ultra long stem versions were used in taverns
where you would purchase a bowlful, smoke it and return it to the barkeep
who would break off the just used piece of stem and make it ready for
another client.

I did a little snooping on the web and found a book of Clay Tobacco Pipes,
by Eric G. Ayto for about nine bucks:
http://dialin.evenlink.com/~amistad/images/clay.jpg

I also found a commemorative English pipe for $65 for the Great Exposition
of 1851 and the Crystal Palace. &quot;London&quot; on one side of the stem and the
maker's name &quot;W.T.Blake&quot; impressed on the other side.
http://dialin.evenlink.com/~amistad/images/clay2.jpg

Plain ones here tend to sell for a few dollars. Fancy decorated or
commemorative types range from $50 to $300 or so. IMHO.

A great plagiarized reference [thanks to Pete Sinacore]:
&quot;The use of tobacco came about - after the discovery of the New World - in
England. By the late 1500's, tobacco was being used in England and
throughout Europe by both men and women. By 1600, there were 3400 pipe
manufacturers in England, and pipe makers guild was incorporated. The Dutch
followed suit in 1697, the Danish in 1655, and the Swiss in 1697. A few
pipes were made in the state of Virginia and Jamaica in the late 17th
century, but it wasn't until the end of the 18th century that the U.S.
manufactured clay pipes on a massive scale.

&quot;The first clay pipes had very small bowls due to the high cost of tobacco.
The bowls increased in size and changed shape after the English started to
cultivate tobacco and subsequently decrease its price. Therefore, you can
usually estimate the age of these early clay pipes by the size and shape of
the bowls. Measuring the diameter of the stem bore can also date them, but
this method usually requires a larger amount of material for comparison.
The best way of dating 17th century pipes is by measuring the diameter,
width, height, angle and size of the bowl and stem. This is really a very
reliable method of dating early pipes. Of course, some of these early pipes
were marked with maker's or owner's marks, making dating and identification
much easier.

&quot;It isn't uncommon to find such early pipes with stems measuring a foot or
more in length. This extra length came in handy on house pipes that were
used by guests. [FR note: maybe not a myth after all] After each patron
enjoyed his smoke, he would break off a very small section of the stem for
sanitary reasons and leave it for the next guest. The late 16th and early
17th century pipes are very difficult to obtain, as they are usually not
allowed to be taken out of Holland, England or any other country of origin.
They are also extremely rare and very difficult to excavate in the U.S.

&quot;The pipes manufactured in the 18th century were mostly from London or
Bristol, England, and were brought to the U.S. by immigrants. These
specimens can usually be dated by the style and shape of the bowls, as they
followed a general typology throughout the century. But the things that
make it possible to date these pipes very close to the actual time of
manufacture are the numerous maker's marks used throughout, the 1700s. One
of the most common is the R.T. mark, and although there are numerous makers
who used this mark, it has most often been attributed to Robert Tippet of
Bristol, and dates circa 1660-1720. There are many variants of the R.T.
pipes at least 12 different types.

&quot;Clay pipes being so fragile, had a very short life span, and therefore can
be dated within plus or minus 10 years of manufacture, those with markings
on them maybe more accurately judged perhaps within a plus or minus a five
year span, and those with full names, within a year or two. This 18th
century era pipe is more easily dug in this country, but a great many
variants of the type are still rare.

&quot;19th century pipes were made with larger bowls because of lower tobacco
prices, and almost all of them had markings of some sort. But the main
difference from the preceding century is the abundance of decorated pipes,
with designs such as flowers, trees, birds, symbols, basket-weave or coat of
arms. But the most interesting were those with the bowls shaped like heads,
or those which were used in political campaigns, such as the &quot;Buck-Cannon,&quot;
a pipe bowl with a horned stag on one side and a cannon on the other. Of
course this was a play on the name of President Buchanan. There were
literally thousands of different decorative variants, which in-creased in
number in the second half of the 19th century.

&quot;Many of these pipes were manufactured in very large quantities, making
collecting them much easier. And although there are so many pipes in this
time period, they are very attractive: it is the most colorful century for
the artistry of pipe making.

&quot;A very interesting pipe is the &quot;Double Indian&quot; Masonic, circa 1770-1790.
It is a 32nd degree Masonic emblem and was dug at Foley Square in
Manhattan.&quot;

P.S. If it WAS done, wouldn't most of the pipes from that period have major

As a matter of fact, yes, the stems of these &quot;tavern&quot; pipes are found in
various lengths, having obviously been broken off. Sanitation, while no
where near as paramount as in our germ paranoid society of today was,
nonetheless, not completely ignored.

I remember clay pipes in the early 60`s as a kid we used to blow soap
bubbles from them, as my dad did before me, they have been produced in GB
for a long time, probably just after Sir Walter Raleigh sobered up, &quot; and
curse Sir Walter Raleigh he was such a stupid get &quot; any way yes, and yes !!

Okay, okay, I've been not chiming in for long enough. When I first
saw Ronnie's post, it reminded me of the clay pipes I used to buy on
10th Street in Allentown, Pa., when I was about 12 years old. I just
thought they were neat, and the tobacconist sold them for a dime
apiece, as I recall. They weren't fancy, but they did have long
stems. I was a year or so away from my first encounter with evil and
wonderful weeds, so I just had them as ... well, *stuff.* Also, I
remember using at least one of them to dip into soap suds and blow
giant bubbles.
