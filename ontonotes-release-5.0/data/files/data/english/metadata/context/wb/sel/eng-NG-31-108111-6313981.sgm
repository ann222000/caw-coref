Do any airlines allow you to purchase a seat for your dog if your dog is
too big to fit under the seat?  I was thinking how nice it would be to put
a travel harness on Roxy and hook her to the seatbelt.  I'm guessing none
do, but figured I'd ask anyway.  My only other option is driving for 10
hours since I won't fly her in the cargo hold.

It'd be nice to sit next to someone knowing they aren't going to hog the
armrest.

In my flying experience, I don't believe any airline will allow you to
do that :( I hate putting my dog in the  cargo hold as well but at
times I have to do it.

Why not?  I've flown my dogs often and the airport crew have
almost always been beyond helpful and the dogs have always come
out of the cargo hold in one piece (mentally and physically).  I
can tell stories where the crew has gone above and beyond their
job descriptions.

Statistically there's probably less risk than driving but it
still doesn't feel right.  I can't get anywhere without
changing planes at least once, anyway, and when Slick flew
in he made an earlier connection than the one he was booked
on and arrived in Elmira early.  The airport staff chewed me
out for not being there when he arrived and I certainly wish
I'd known so I could be there, but if he's got to wait
around in a crate better in the little airport in Elmira
than in Detroit.

I have a meeting in Chicago this summer and I'm thinking of
driving out, partly because I hate to fly but mostly because
I'm thinking of going up to Wisconsin afterwards to do some
camping and to visit the kennel Slick came from to see
who's for sale.  But, on the other hand, no more new dogs
until we get some races under our belt and see how those go.

Anyway, I used to fly about 80,000 miles/year and saw a lot
of stuff I didn't like, like crates sitting unattended on a
hot tarmac, and would just as soon not fly a dog.  It's not
that I won't, but that I have a strong preference not to.

I'm pretty anal about flying my dogs, but WestJet has been
fantastic.  They bring the dogs out at the last minute and
park them under the wing.  I've had ticket booth people
volunteer to go with the dogs and supervise the luggage
handlers (this was in Toronto where the handlers aren't
WestJet employees).

Since WestJet flies only 737s and puts the dogs in the forward
hold, I always book a window seat in rows 7 to 11 so I can
watch the luggage ramp.  Plus, I'm always the last one on the
plane so I can watch my dog being loaded.

I used to take only direct flights, but since I found out
where to sit, I don't mind a stopover.  I've never had to
change planes, though.

That said, this year the AAC Nationals are in southern Ontario
and, instead of flying, Team Alberta is renting a bus,
removing half the seats for dog crates, and hiring 2 drivers
to drive us straight through (30 plus hours each way).  This
gives us transportation and secure benching at the nationals.

Most of the time, my luggage flies on the same plane I do, and I have no
complaints about the way it is handled.  I'm worried about the
exceptions.  For example, this last trip flying from Calgary to Toronto,
going through customs in Toronto, then continuing from Toronto to Logan,
my checked wheelie didn't make it from Calgary to Toronto.  As it
happened, it was no big deal.  The baggage clerk in Toronto made the
necessary phone calls and put the necessary stamp on my boarding pass so
I could go through customs without it.  They delivered it to my front
porch the next day.  Truth be told, it was more convenient than lugging
it through the airport, onto a bus, then into a taxi.  I wish all my
luggage were delivered to my home the following day.

BUT, there was no explanation for what went wrong!  If that "bag" had
been my dog, I'd have been a basket case.  I'd have had to stay in
Toronto until my dog was delivered, missed my connecting flight,
probably would have been taken in by airport security for questioning
for going crazy and becoming obnoxious.  It's great when the crew goes
out of their way to make sure everything goes well.  I believe you when
you say they do, but I'd have to say the crew went out of their way to
make sure everything went well when they lost my bag too.  Mistakes happen.

I realize my example is for an international flight where things must be
different, but I'm extremely reluctant to fly with a dog in the cargo
hold and haven't since Genny was a pup.  (Around 1982 was the last time
I flew a dog like that).  Cubbe was in a boarding kennel for 3 weeks at
$20/day this last trip.  Maybe that wasn't optimum, but I never worried
about her the whole time I was gone.  (And they gave her a good report
card when I got back.)

Did you watch that bag being loaded onto the plane?  Did you ask

where you could watch the luggage ramp?  Heh, probably not, but

Great idea!  I've never flown a dog, but have to admit that I'd be
hesitant to.  Like someone else said, the odds may even be worse to
drive, but I like to feel a bit more in control of our own destinies

not that this is the case for you, but does anyone know what they do with

I fly pretty frequently.  Not as much as I used to, but still more than the
average person.  Virtually every flight I take has a stop and a change of
planes.  There have been plenty of times when my first leg has been delayed
and I have run from one gate to the next only to watch my next flight take
off without me.  Or it was gone before I even landed.  That usually means
several hours or more of waiting before I can be put on another flight.  My
luggage has been misdirected more than a few times, so I don't trust the
system to get my dog to the right place at the right time.  I've just seen
too many animal carriers sit unattended at the baggage pick up areas.  The
only way I will put my dog on a flight in the cargo hold will be if I move
to a country I can't reach by car, but that's not likely to happen.

I'd gladly pay full fare for a seat for Roxy.  Or if they'd let me fly in
the cargo hold with my dog, that would also work.  I guess neither are
options.

Not likely!  I think there are a lot of people who would pay full fare
for their dog to ride in the cabin though.  There IS a solution.  Get
a toy breed and you can carry-on.  But then you'd have a toy breed. No
"add water and watch it grow" once you get to your destination.
Nothing against toy breeds BTW, but if you want something larger,
you're out of luck.

I'm starting to get a beautiful picture.  The seats of the plane are
removed except for a few for the people.  For take-off, all people are
seated with their seatbelts securely fastened.  All dogs are safely
crated and the crates buckled in as necessary.  After that, the bets are
off.  Dogs are uncrated, and the plane becomes an off-leash dog park.
Now for THAT, I'd pay extra.

Before I had children I used to think, "will someone please shut that
child UP!"  Now crying babies pull on my heart strings and I always
think, "that poor little thing!"  So I don't mind babies.  But when
someone's poorly behaved brat is kicking my seat, I don't hesitate to
have a talk with the child, nicely of course.  The parents usually die of
humiliation.  Added bonus, since the idiots clearly didn't teach their
children airplane etiquette.

I often wonder about how the toy breeds in the cabin effect people with
allergies.  Maybe with their typical frequent grooming it isn't much of a
problem.  With as many sick people that fly, having sick dogs on board
with mine sounds like a nightmare I don't want to deal with.

I got 6 inches worth of screwed (no, not THAT way).

Annie would have been *perfect* for bringing on the cabin, if she were
just a few inches shorter.

Once or twice a week, I take out the carry on sized Sherpa I have for
the cats, and teach her to hop in and make herself "Little". She still
fits, and can certainly scrunch herself up into a teeny ball that takes
up only one corner of it, but she could NOT stand up if she needed to.

Comes from having a dog that's part Daddy Long Legs, I guess.

And I'm Uber bummed that Amtrak doesn't allow dogs in ANY capacity,
whether in a carrier or not. What's up with that? I go to Rhode Island
at least twice a year, and I figured I'd at least be able to take her
there since she's only 14 pounds.

I was on a flight with a toddler who was having ear trouble.  I know from
experience that if you can get them to suck on something, it helps.
After watching the parents try everything and not wanting to interfere, I
finally went up and offered a sucker that I had in my purse, telling them
that if the child sucked on it, her ears would pop and she'd be much
happier.  The parents looked at me disdainfully and said, "We don't allow
our children to have sugar."  They let the child scream itself to sleep.
I'm sure that little bit of sugar would have caused far more harm to
their child than being in pain did.  Never mind the obligation to fellow
passengers.

If the parents are really trying, I feel sorry for them.  If they are
letting their kid kick seats or just yelling at the crying baby or
whatever, I want to smack them.  I, too, talk to the kids directly, just
turning around and asking them not to kick the seat because it kicks me
in the back.  They usually haven't made that connection.  I haven't come
across any evil kids on planes yet, just bored, uncomfortable, ignorant

Wow, that's awful for that child!  For future reference, another thing
that works for very young children and babies is to cup your hand over
their ears, try to form a seal and pull it away quickly.  I've taught
that trick to a few parents.  It's not always successful.  The flight
attendants can also wet washcloths with warm water for the same purpose.
It works a little better.  Nothing is better than sucking, though.  It's
really painful for the little ones.  When they are a little older you can
teach them to "plug their nose and blow it."  Works like a charm.  Or
give them some gum.

I always blame the parents for the bad behavior of their children, unless
the child has an obvious disability.  Then I just let it slide
completely.  My kids have flown tons and they know better than to
interfere with the the comfort of other passengers and have since they
were little.  Some adults on planes don't even know that, though... I get
especially annoyed wtih people who pull on your seat every time they
stand up or sit down.

I really don't enjoy flying anymore.  I miss the days of half empty
planes.

Dogs are treated as luggage in every way, with the exception of how they
are physically moved from carts to the cargo hold.  It's not baloney at
all.  As I mentioned, I've seen dogs sitting unattended in their carriers
at the baggage claim area.  Too many risks IMO.

If I thought of my dog as baggage, I wouldn't be concerned about flying
with her.  If that's what you are implying, you're completely off base.
The unfortunate reality is that animals in carriers that fly in cargo
holds *are* treated as baggage in virtually every way on US carriers.
Airline personnel are not responsible to care for your animal if there is
a mixup, and mixups do happen.

Ah, now I see the problem.  You must have missed where I said "I fly
pretty frequently.  Not as much as I used to, but still more than the
average person.  Virtually every flight I take has a stop and a change of
planes."  I should have also qualified that with, "the only flights I
take that are direct are to Chicago, Atlanta or Baltimore, places where I
only go for business and wouldn't take my dog."

Any guidelines you read about flying with your pet in a cargo hold
recommend direct, non-stop flights.  Not an option for me to the places I
would want to take my dog, and the basis for my stated concerns.
Obviously your experience is different, and that's terrific, but as I
also said, not everyone has the option of flying direct.  If they can,
your advice is excellent.

That's enough, in my experience.  I've had crap dumped on me
by toddlers in the next seat on several occasions.  I
remember one particularly awful duo.  *Very* well dressed
(madras and khaki, in this day and age), about 8 and 10.
They were throwing stuff at the birds inside the Pittsburgh
terminal and their parents thought it was funny.  That very
likely doesn't mean that they're going to grow up to be
serial killers (Republicans, probably) but it was wrong.
Then in Ithaca they were climbing all over the luggage belt
while it was running.  They were a couple of badly-raised,
pain-in-the-ass kids who annoyed an awful lot of people in a
short period of time.

for ED kids in Boston. Some kind soul had donated a beach house to our
institution so for two weeks every summer we got to take the kids there.
We went there in a school bus, and one time one of the workers brought
her very sweet Samoyed with her. Well, it was summer, it was HOT, and we
had all the windows open but everyone was sweating anyway. And the Sammy
was blowing coat. When we arrived at the Cape house, we were all covered
in white dog hair.

My early childhood memories of living on Lake Michigan involve a lot

Now might be a good time to tell you about Spike, the Min-Pin from the dog
park ( http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/spanaval/Dogs/Spike3.jpg - That's
him at 3 months).  While his female owner buys him outfits and dresses him
up for winter, she refuses to coddle him.  If she brings him, he usually
bops around and minds his own business.  The moment the male owner shows up,
he starts shivering.  He then promptly gets picked up and stuffed inside the
human's jacket.

I don't know how, but he has managed to sucker most of the men who are
regulars (but only a couple of the women) into picking him up.

First off, my dogs, while not toys, say that there is no such thing as too
much time holding them.  Unless the dog needs to go do something else more
important, like patrol the yard to hold off invading moles and squirrels or
supervise food preparation in another room.  (Best is if a second human goes
into the kitchen with them to hold them up at sufficient height to better
supervise.  Two birds with one stone.)  Or unless your lap is too hot for
them to tolerate.  (Clearly your fault.)

I don't think I've ever seen an uncropped Min-Pin.  Is that what the ears
always look like?  I might have to consider a Min-Pin.

Those ears are almost as good as the ones on that petfinder dog that was
linked here a couple of weeks ago - the one named Yoda, was in Virginia I
think.  I sent that picture to a relative in western Maryland - just
taunting them.

One of these days I'm going to get a picture of Spenser on the dog walk at
agility class.  He has no dog walk problems and he doesn't seem to
universalize (is that a word?) this to other dog walks BUT he hates the
class dog walk.  He crosses it at about a quarter of his usual speed and
puts his ears (cropped) out straight on each side.  As levelers or for
balance I suspect.  Gotta get a picture before the equipment gets replaced
(which is to be soon).

My son suffered from a series of ear infections that began almost at
birth and plagued him until he got tubes at the age of 6 months.
Cupping his ears with my hands gave him relief when nothing else was
working.  I always knew when I'd gotten it just right because the
sobbing would stop.  Rather than popping the ears, though, I just tried
to maintain steady suction or pressure (his preference varied), and
warmth until he fell asleep, usually in minutes due to exhaustion from
crying.

Leaning over and then holding very still for sometimes several minutes
at a time is hard on the back and arms but it really worked amazingly
well with no scary potential side effects.  And although he was way
pre-verbal he still could tell me his ears hurt by grabbing my hands and
placing them over his ears.

The last of the ear infections faded into an unhappy memory about a
decade ago but he'll still put my hands over his ears when he's sick or
hurt.  He learned to cup-and-pop his own ears on airplane flights when
yawning, sucking hard candy and/or drinking a hot beverage don't seem to
be doing the trick, and also uses the same technique to help relieve ear
pain caused by swimming deep without equalizing.

That's funny.  I very rarely see cropped ones.

Seems to be the norm around here.  The ears look disproportionately large in
that picture, BTW.  His head grew a bit to catch up with the giant ears.

&gt;&gt;Hey now! Your puny little disclaimer later on does NOTHING to mitigate
&gt;&gt;this OUTRAGEOUS statement. I am shocked, simply shocked.

&gt; Actually, I envision that someday, I may choose to only have a toy
&gt; breed, so I CAN travel with them by plane, with them snug under the
&gt; seat.  I'm a sucker for little dogs though - I know that I would spend
&gt; way too much time holding them, than would be prudent.

Snuggling with the little dogs is most excellent. Neither of my other two
like to snuggle as much, although both do it more now that Max is leading
the way.

I think I might be a pom person in my later years (after the unthinkable
occurs). They're hardy, but walking them is like walking a feather. A
little less... athletic, shall we say? than walking the bigger dogs can
be at times.
