September 24, 2007

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
To say that the US anti-war movement is impotent (see below) is
to give it the benefit of the doubt.  In fact, it may be
government-controlled--either directly via infiltrators or indirectly
via foundation grants.
This is why it's so refreshing to find Ted Glick and others
forming a fusion movement called No War, No Warming.  Their actions in
DC October 21-23 deserve our utmost support, so please go to
&lt;nowarnowarming.org&gt; and check them out.
In particular, we should all get behind their National
Intervention October 22 wherein they seek through nonviolent civil
disobedience to &quot;Take Over Capitol Hill&quot;.
Let's hope that they in turn will welcome &quot;9/11 Was An Inside
Job&quot; as a major theme in their presentations during these three days.
How otherwise will they be able to explain to folks opposed to war
how the US has been able to get away with its vicious illegal
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq?

Yours for solution energies,

Keith Lampe, Ro-Non-So-Te,

9/11 - blowback inadequate; free-fall speed beats experts - Paul

9/11 Explains the
Impotence of the Anti-War Movement

By Paul Craig Roberts
09/14/07

http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18391.htm

The anti-war movement has proven impotent to stop the war in Iraq
despite the fact that the war was initiated on the basis of lies and
deception. The anti-war movement stands helpless to prevent President
Bush from attacking Iran or any other country that he might demonize
for harboring a future 9/11 threat.

September 11 enabled Bush to take America to war and to keep America
at war even though the governments explanation of the events of
September 11 is mired in controversy and disbelieved by a large
percentage of the population.

Although the news medias investigative arm has withered, other
entities and individuals continue to struggle with unanswered
questions. In the six years since 9/11, numerous distinguished
scientists, engineers, architects, intelligence officers, pilots,
military officers, air traffic controllers, and foreign dignitaries
have raised serious and unanswered questions about the official story
line.

Recognition of the inadequacy of the official account of the collapse
of the twin towers is widespread in the scientific and technical
community. One of the most glaring failures in the official account is
the lack of an explanation of the near free-fall speed at which the
buildings failed once the process began. Some scientists and engineers
have attempted to bolster the official account with explanations of
how this might happen in the absence of explosives used in controlled
demolitions.

One recent example is the work of Cambridge University engineer, Dr.
Keith Seffen, published in the Journal of Engineering Mechanics and
reported by the BBC on September 11, 2007. Dr. Seffen constructed a
mathematical model that concludes that once initiation of failure had
begun, progressive collapse of the structures would be rapid.

Another example is the work of retired government scientist Dr. Manuel
Garcia, commissioned by CounterPunch to fill the gaping void in the
official report. Garcia concludes, as does Seffen, that explosives are
not necessary to explain the near free-fall speed at which the WTC
buildings collapsed.

Seffen and Garcia each offer a speculative hypothesis about what could
have happened. Their accounts are not definitive explanations based on
evidence of what did happen. Thus, Seffen and Garcia bring us to the
crux of the matter: To understand the buildings failures, we must
rely on theoretical speculative models, because the forensic evidence
was not examined. Their explanations thus have no more validity than a
speculative hypothesis that explains the failure of the buildings as a
result of explosives.

To rationally choose between the hypotheses, we would need to see how
well each fits with the evidence, but most of the evidence was quickly
dispersed and destroyed by federal authorities. Most of the evidence
that remains consists largely of human testimony: the hundred
witnesses who were inside the two towers and who report hearing and
experiencing explosions and the televised statement of Larry
Silverstein, the leaseholder of the WTC properties, who clearly said
that the decision was made  to pull  WTC 7.

Today, six years after 9/11, money, ideologies, accumulated
resentments, and political careers are all allied with the official
story line on 9/11. Anyone on a Republican mailing list or a
conservative activist list, such as Young Americans for Freedom, knows
that fundraising appeals seldom fail to evoke the 9/11 attack on
America. The 9/11 attacks gave neoconservatives their  new Pearl
Harbor  that enabled them to implement their hegemonic agenda in the
Middle East. The 9/11 attacks gave Americans boiling with accumulated
frustrations a foe upon whom to vent their rage. Politicians, even
Democrats, could show that they stood tall for America. George W. Bush
has invested two presidential terms in  fighting terror  by invading
countries in the Middle East.

September 11 doubters are a threat to the legitimacy of these massive
material and emotional interests. That is why they are shouted down as
conspiracy theorists.  But if the governments story has to be
improved by outside experts in order to be plausible, then it is not
irrational or kooky to doubt the official explanation.

Elements of the American left-wing are also frustrated by 9/11
doubters. CounterPunch, for example, views 9/11 as blowback from an
immoral US foreign policy and as retribution for Americas past sins
in the Middle East. Manuel Garcia shares this viewpoint. In the
September 12, 2007, CounterPunch, Garcia writes that  rationalists and
realists  are people who see 9/11  as blowback from decades of inhuman
US foreign policy. Viewing 9/11 as a government conspiracy lets US
foreign policy off the hook.

This is a legitimate point of view. But it has a downside. September
11 was the excuse for committing yet more inhuman deeds by initiating
open-ended wars on both Muslims and US civil liberties. Defending the
governments account, instead of pressing the government for
accountability, was liberating for the Bush administration.

Even in the official account, the story is one of massive failures:
the failures of US intelligence services, the failures of airport
security, the failures to intercept the hijacked airliners, the
failures to preserve evidence. If a common front had taken the Bush
administration to task both for failing to prevent the 9/11 attacks
and for an explanation of 9/11 so inadequate that its plausibility
depends on outside experts, Bush could not have so easily shifted the
blame to Afghanistan and Iraq. Most 9/11 doubters do not insist on the
US governments complicity in the deed. Failure to protect, or
incompetence, is a sufficient charge to deter an administration from
war by turning it against itself with demands for accountability.

But no one was held accountable for 9/11 except Muslim countries. This
is the reason the anti-war movement is impotent.

Mystery surrounds deaths of Minot airmen 22 Sep 2007 Six members of
the US Air Force who were involved in the Minot AFB incident, have
died mysteriously, an anti-Bush activist group [Citizens for
Legitimate Government] says. The incident happened when a B-52 bomber
was &quot;mistakenly&quot; loaded with six nuclear warheads and flown for more
than three hours across several states, prompting an Air Force
investigation and the firing of one commander.

Iran's Ahmadinejad: No Attack on Israel 24 Sep 2007 Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Monday that Iran would not launch an attack
on Israel or any other country, and he does not believe the U.S. is
preparing for war against Iran. ''Iran will not attack any country,''
Ahmadinejad told The Associated Press. Iran has always maintained a
defensive policy, not an offensive one, he said, and has ''never
sought to expand its territory [unlike Dictator Bush].&quot;

Iranian Leader Denies Bomb, War Reports --Ahmadinejad Arrives In New
York 23 Sep 2007 Iran's president denies Tehran is building an atomic
bomb and says it's not on a path to war with the U.S. In an interview

Blackwater: Hired Guns, Above the Law

by Jeremy Scahill

Global Research, September 22, 2007

The Nation - 2007-09-21

See Video, which follows text.

Editor's Note: This is an edited transcript of the prepared testimony
of Jeremy Scahill before the Senate Democratic Policy Committee,
September 21, 2007.

My name is Jeremy Scahill. I am an investigative reporter for The
Nation magazine and the author of the book Blackwater: The Rise of the
World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army. I have spent the better part of
the past several years researching the phenomenon of privatized
warfare and the increasing involvement of the private sector in the
support and waging of US wars. During the course of my investigations,
I have interviewed scores of sources, filed many Freedom of
Information Act requests, obtained government contracts and private
company documents of firms operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and
elsewhere. When asked, I have attempted to share the results of my
investigations, including documents obtained through FOIA and other
processes, with members of Congress and other journalists.

I would like to thank this committee for the opportunity to be here
today and for taking on this very serious issue. Over the past six
days, we have all been following very closely the developments out of
Baghdad in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of as many as 20 Iraqis
by operatives working for the private military company Blackwater USA.
The Iraqi government is alleging that among the dead are a small child
and her parents and the prime minister has labeled Blackwater's
conduct as &quot;criminal&quot; and spoke of &quot;the killing of our citizens in
cold blood.&quot; While details remain murky and subject to conflicting
versions of what exactly happened, this situation cuts much deeper
than this horrifying incident. The stakes are very high for the Bush
administration because the company involved, Blackwater USA, is not
just any company. It is the premiere firm protecting senior State
Department officials in Iraq, including Ambassador Ryan Crocker. This
company has been active in Iraq since the early days of the occupation
when it was awarded an initial $27 million no-bid contract to guard
Ambassador Paul Bremer. During its time in Iraq, Blackwater has
regularly engaged in firefights and other deadly incidents. About 30
of its operatives have been killed in Iraq and these deaths are not
included in the official American death toll.

While the company's operatives are indeed soldiers of fortune, their
salaries are paid through hundreds of millions of dollars in US
taxpayer funds allocated to Blackwater. What they do in Iraq is done
in the name of the American people and yet there has been no effective
oversight of Blackwater's activities and actions. And there has been
absolutely no prosecution of its forces for any crimes committed
against Iraqis. If indeed Iraqi civilians were killed by Blackwater
USA last Sunday, as appears to be the case, culpability for these
actions does not only lie with the individuals who committed the
killings or with Blackwater as a company, but also with the entity
that hired them and allowed them to operate heavily-armed inside
Iraq--in this case, the US State Department.

While the headlines of the past week have been focused on the fatal
shootings last Sunday, this was by no means an isolated incident. Nor
is this is simply about a rogue company or rogue operators. This is
about a system of unaccountable and out of control private forces that
have turned Iraq into a wild west from the very beginning of the
occupation, often with the stamp of legitimacy of the US government.

What happened Sunday is part of a deadly pattern, not just of
Blackwater USA's conduct, but of the army of mercenaries that have
descended on Iraq over the past four years. They have acted like
cowboys, running Iraqis off the road, firing indiscriminately at
vehicles and, in some cases, private forces have appeared on tape
seemingly using Iraqis for target practice. They have shown little
regard for Iraqi lives and have fueled the violence in that country,
not just against the people of Iraq but also against the official
soldiers of the United States military in the form of blowback and
revenge attacks stemming from contractor misconduct. These private
forces have operated in a climate where impunity and immunity have
gone hand in hand.

Active duty soldiers who commit crimes or acts of misconduct are
prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the court
martial system. There have been scores of prosecutions of soldiers--
some 64 courts martial on murder-related charges in Iraq alone. That
has not been the case with these private forces. Despite many
reports--some from US military commanders--of private contractors
firing indiscriminately at Iraqis and vehicles and killing civilians,
not a single armed contractor has been charged with any crime. They
have not been prosecuted under US civilian law; US military law and
the Bush administration banned the Iraqi government from prosecuting
them in Iraqi courts beginning with the passage of Coalition
Provisional Authority Order 17 in 2004. The message this sends to the
Iraqi people is that these hired guns are above any law.

US contractors in Iraq reportedly have their own motto: &quot;What happens
here today, stays here today.&quot; That should be chilling to everyone who
believes in transparency and accountability of US operations and
taxpayer funded activities-- not to mention the human rights of the
Iraqis who have fallen victim to these incidents and have been robbed
of any semblance of justice.

The Iraqi government says it has evidence of seven deadly incidents
involving Blackwater. It is essential that the Congress request
information on these incidents from the Iraqi authorities. What we do
know is that in just the past nine months, Blackwater forces have been
involved with several fatal actions. Last Christmas Eve, as Katy
mentioned, an off-duty Blackwater contractor allegedly killed a
bodyguard for the Iraqi Vice President. Blackwater whisked that
individual out of the country. Iraqi officials labeled the killing a
&quot;murder&quot; and have questioned privately as to why there has apparently
been no consequences for that individual. Blackwater says it fired the
individual and is cooperating with the US Justice Department. To my
knowledge no charges have yet been brought in that case.

This past May, Blackwater operatives engaged in a gun battle in
Baghdad, lasting an hour, that drew in both US military and Iraqi
forces, in which at least four Iraqis are said to have died. The very
next day in almost the same neighborhood, the company's operatives
reportedly shot and killed an Iraqi driver near the Interior Ministry.
In the ensuing chaos, the Blackwater guards reportedly refused to give
their names or details of the incident to Iraqi officials, sparking a
tense standoff between American and Iraqi forces, both of which were
armed with assault rifles.

The actions of this one company, perhaps more than any other private
actor in the occupation, have consistently resulted in escalated
tension and more death and destruction in Iraq--from the siege of
Fallujah, sparked by the ambush of its men there in March of 2004, to
Blackwater forces shooting at Iraqis in Najaf with one Blackwater
operative filmed on tape saying it was like a &quot;turkey shoot&quot; to the
deadly events of the past week.

Colonel Thomas Hammes, the US military official once overseeing the
creation of a new Iraqi military, has described driving around Iraq
with Iraqis and encountering Blackwater operatives. &quot;[They] were
running me off the road. We were threatened and intimidated,&quot; Hammes
said. But, he added, &quot;they were doing their job, exactly what they
were paid to do in the way they were paid to do it, and they were
making enemies on every single pass out of town.&quot; Hammes concluded the
contractors were &quot; hurting our counterinsurgency effort.&quot;

Brigadier General Karl Horst, deputy commander of the 3rd Infantry
Division said of private security contractors, &quot;These guys run loose
in this country and do stupid stuff. There's no authority over them,
so you can't come down on them hard when they escalate force.... They
shoot people, and someone else has to deal with the aftermath. It
happens all over the place.&quot; Horst tracked contractor conduct for a
two month period in Baghdad and documented at least a dozen shootings
of Iraqi civilians by contractors, resulting in six Iraqi deaths and
the wounding of three others. That is just one General in one area of
Iraq in just 60 days.

The conduct of these private forces sends a clear message to the
Iraqi people: American lives are worth infinitely more than theirs,
even if their only crime is driving their vehicle in the wrong place
at the wrong time. One could say that Blackwater has been very
successful at fulfilling its mission--to keep alive senior US
officials. But at what price?

It is long past due for the actions of Blackwater USA and the other
private military firms operating in Iraq--actions carried out in the
names of the American people and with US tax dollars--to be carefully
and thoroughly investigated by the US Congress. For the Iraqi people,
this is a matter of life, and far too often, death. In the bigger
picture, this body should seriously question whether the linking of
corporate profits to war making is in the best interests of this
nation and the world. I would humbly submit that the chairs of
relevant committees in both the House and Senate use their power of
subpoena to compel the heads of the major war contracting companies
operating on the US payroll in Iraq to appear publicly before the
American people and answer for the actions of their forces. I am
prepared to answer any questions.

Subject: Blogs Team Up to Help Environment on Blog Action Day

Blogs Team Up to Help Environment  for One Day
By Adrienne So

If a march on Washington is an effective form of political protest,
how about a rally that takes place online? And what if the rally is
organized by professionals instead of grassroots activists -- does
that undercut its legitimacy as a form of political action? We'll find
out on Oct. 15.

That is Blog Action Day, organized by Sydney-based blogger Collis
Ta'eed, a day during which more than 5,000 bloggers worldwide have
agreed to blog about a single topic: the environment. Signers-on to
the Blog Action Day plan include such high-profile sites as Lifehacker
and GigaOM.

&quot;We chose the environment because it's pretty adaptable,&quot; said Ta'eed.
&quot;Next year we'll try tackling something a little more pressing, maybe
not so popular.&quot;

As it turns out, Blog Action Day is less about a particular issue than
it is about the blogosphere flexing its muscles, with professional
help. Ta'eed is the general manager of Eden Creative Communities, a
startup that hosts websites aimed at the artistic demographic. Ta'eed
and cofounder Leo Baubata also contribute to blogs that provide
resources for freelancers and tips on how to build steady readership,
raising the question: How will Blog Action Day benefit Eden and its
family of sites?

Although Eden is a for-profit company, its website is selling Blog
Action Day as a not-for-profit initiative. And affiliations may matter
less than the fact that a deserving issue is receiving some
much-needed attention. &quot;A bunch of voices talking about the same thing
at the same time gets more people's attention than the usual cacophony
of posts,&quot; said Gina Trapani of Lifehacker, a participant. Of course,
if it brings those sites extra attention and a little traffic, so much
the better.

Many of the participating blogs will offer practical advice, like Dumb
Little Man, which posts financial tips, and LifeClever, which focuses
on design. Some, despite their intentions to participate, are
skeptical about Blog Action Day's chances to effect change. &quot;How do
you measure effectiveness?&quot; asked LifeClever's Chanpory Rith. &quot;Does it
fail if it doesn't get on Digg?&quot;

But as Trapani noted, bloggers invest a lot of time in building their
platform, so why not use that power for good? &quot;It's the least we can
do for a worthy cause,&quot; said Reddit's Alexis Ohanian, who will change
the Reddit mascot in honor of the day (Disclosure: Reddit is owned by
Conde Nast, Wired News' parent company.) And if Blog Action Day is
less about the environment than it is about uniting thousands of
bloggers, there is huge potential to expand. &quot;Next year it could be
global poverty,&quot; said Ta'eed. &quot;Or whaling!&quot;

(2) 2,000-year-old Sumerian cities torn apart and plundered: It is the
death of history, by Robert Fisk
From: Paul de Burgh-Day &lt;pdebu ... @bigpond.com&gt;

It
Is the Death of History
Special investigation by Robert Fisk
Published: 17 September 2007

2,000-year-old Sumerian cities torn apart and plundered by robbers.
The very walls of the mighty Ur of the Chaldees cracking under the
strain of massive troop movements, the privatisation of looting as
landlords buy up the remaining sites of ancient Mesopotamia to strip
them of their artefacts and wealth. The near total destruction of
Iraq's historic past  the very cradle of human civilisation  has
emerged as one of the most shameful symbols of our disastrous occupation.

Evidence amassed by archaeologists shows that even those Iraqis who
trained as archaeological workers in Saddam Hussein's regime are now
using their knowledge to join the looters in digging through the
ancient cities, destroying thousands of priceless jars, bottles and
other artefacts in their search for gold and other treasures.

In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, armies of looters moved in on
the desert cities of southern Iraq and at least 13 Iraqi museums were
plundered. Today, almost every archaeological site in southern Iraq is
under the control of looters.

In a long and devastating appraisal to be published in December,
Lebanese archaeologist Joanne Farchakh says that armies of looters
have not spared &quot;one metre of these Sumerian capitals that have been
buried under the sand for thousands of years.

&quot;They systematically destroyed the remains of this civilisation in
their tireless search for sellable artefacts: ancient cities, covering
an estimated surface area of 20 square kilometres, which  if properly
excavated  could have provided extensive new information concerning
the development of the human race.

&quot;Humankind is losing its past for a cuneiform tablet or a sculpture or
piece of jewellery that the dealer buys and pays for in cash in a
country devastated by war. Humankind is losing its history for the
pleasure of private collectors living safely in their luxurious houses
and ordering specific objects for their collection.&quot;

Ms Farchakh, who helped with the original investigation into stolen
treasures from the Baghdad Archaeological Museum in the immediate
aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, says Iraq may soon end up with no
history.

&quot;There are 10,000 archaeological sites in the country. In the
Nassariyah area alone, there are about 840 Sumerian sites; they have
all been systematically looted. Even when Alexander the Great
destroyed a city, he would always build another. But now the robbers
are destroying everything because they are going down to bedrock.
What's new is that the looters are becoming more and more organised
with, apparently, lots of money.

&quot;Quite apart from this, military operations are damaging these sites
forever. There's been a US base in Ur for five years and the walls are
cracking because of the weight of military vehicles. It's like putting
an archaeological site under a continuous earthquake.&quot;

Of all the ancient cities of present-day Iraq, Ur is regarded as the
most important in the history of man-kind. Mentioned in the Old
Testament  and believed by many to be the home of the Prophet Abraham
it also features in the works of Arab historians and geographers
where its name is Qamirnah, The City of the Moon.

Founded in about 4,000 BC, its Sumerian people established the
principles of irrigation, developed agriculture and metal-working.
Fifteen hundred years later  in what has become known as &quot;the age of
the deluge&quot;  Ur produced some of the first examples of writing, seal
inscriptions and construction. In neighbouring Larsa, baked clay
bricks were used as money orders  the world's first cheques  the
depth of finger indentations in the clay marking the amount of money
to be transferred. The royal tombs of Ur contained jewellery, daggers,
gold, azurite cylindrical seals and sometimes the remains of slaves.

US officers have repeatedly said a large American base built at
Babylon was to protect the site but Iraqi archaeologist Zainab
Bah-rani, a professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia
University, says this &quot;beggars belief&quot;. In an analysis of the city,
she says: &quot;The damage done to Babylon is both extensive and
irreparable, and even if US forces had wanted to protect it, placing
guards round the site would have been far more sensible than
bulldozing it and setting up the largest coalition military
headquarters in the region.&quot;

Air strikes in 2003 left historical monuments undamaged, but Professor
Bahrani, says: &quot;The occupation has resulted in a tremendous
destruction of history well beyond the museums and libraries looted
and destroyed at the fall of Baghdad. At least seven historical sites
have been used in this way by US and coalition forces since April
2003, one of them being the historical heart of Samarra, where the
Askari shrine built by Nasr al Din Shah was bombed in 2006.&quot;

The use of heritage sites as military bases is a breach of the Hague
Convention and Protocol of 1954 (chapter 1, article 5) which covers
periods of occupation; although the US did not ratify the Convention,
Italy, Poland, Australia and Holland, all of whom sent forces to Iraq,
are contracting parties.

Ms Farchakh notes that as religious parties gain influence in all the
Iraqi pro-vinces, archaeological sites are also falling under their
control. She tells of Abdulamir Hamdani, the director of antiquities
for Di Qar province in the south who desperately  but vainly  tried
to prevent the destruction of the buried cities during the occupation.
Dr Hamdani himself wrote that he can do little to prevent &quot;the
disaster we are all witnessing and observing&quot;.

In 2006, he says: &quot;We recruited 200 police officers because we were
trying to stop the looting by patrolling the sites as often as
possible. Our equipment was not enough for this mission because we
only had eight cars, some guns and other weapons and a few radio
transmitters for the entire province where 800 archaeological sites
have been inventoried.

&quot;Of course, this is not enough but we were trying to establish some
order until money restrictions within the government meant that we
could no longer pay for the fuel to patrol the sites. So we ended up
in our offices trying to fight the looting, but that was also before
the religious parties took over southern Iraq.&quot;

Last year, Dr Hamdani's antiquities department received notice from
the local authorities, approving the creation of mud-brick factories
in areas surrounding Sumerian archaeological sites. But it quickly
became apparent that the factory owners intended to buy the land from
the Iraqi government because it covered several Sumerian capitals and
other archaeological sites. The new landlord would &quot;dig&quot; the
archaeological site, dissolve the &quot;old mud brick&quot; to form the new one
for the market and sell the unearthed finds to antiquity traders.

Dr Hamdani bravely refused to sign the dossier. Ms Farchakh says: &quot;His
rejection had rapid consequences. The religious parties controlling
Nassariyah sent the police to see him with orders to jail him on
corruption charges. He was imprisoned for three months, awaiting
trial. The State Board of Antiquities and Heritage defended him during
his trial, as did his powerful tribe. He was released and regained his
position. The mud-brick factories are 'frozen projects', but reports
have surfaced of a similar strategy being employed in other cities and
in nearby archaeological sites such as the Aqarakouf Ziggarat near
Baghdad. For how long can Iraqi archaeologists maintain order? This is
a question only Iraqi politicians affiliated to the different
religious parties can answer, since they approve these projects.&quot;

Police efforts to break the power of the looters, now with a
well-organised support structure helped by tribal leaders, have proved
lethal. In 2005, the Iraqi customs arrested  with the help of Western
troops  several antiquities dealers in the town of Al Fajr, near
Nasseriyah. They seized hundreds of artefacts and decided to take them
to the museum in Baghdad. It was a fatal mistake.

The convoy was stopped a few miles from Baghdad, eight of the customs
agents were murdered, and their bodies burnt and left to rot in the
desert. The artefacts disappeared. &quot;It was a clear message from the
antiquities dealers to the world,&quot; Ms Farchakh says.

The legions of antiquities looters work within a smooth mass-smuggling
organisation. Trucks, cars, planes and boats take Iraq's historical
plunder to Europe, the US, to the United Arab Emirates and to Japan.
The archaeologists say an ever-growing number of internet websites
offer Mesopotamian artefacts, objects anywhere up to 7,000 years old.

The farmers of southern Iraq are now professional looters, knowing how
to outline the walls of buried buildings and able to break directly
into rooms and tombs. The archaeologists' report says: &quot;They have been
trained in how to rob the world of its past and they have been making
significant profit from it. They know the value of each object and it
is difficult to see why they would stop looting.&quot;

After the 1991 Gulf War, archaeologists hired the previous looters as
workers and promised them government salaries. This system worked as
long as the archaeologists remained on the sites, but it was one of
the main reasons for the later destruction; people now knew how to
excavate and what they could find.

Ms Farchakh adds: &quot;The longer Iraq finds itself in a state of war, the
more the cradle of civilisation is threatened. It may not even last
for our grandchildren to learn from.&quot;

A land with fields of ancient pottery

By Joanne Farchakh, archaeologist

Iraq's rural societies are very different to our own. Their concept of
ancient civilisations and heritage does not match the standards set by
our own scholars. History is limited to the stories and glories of
your direct ancestors and your tribe. So for them, the &quot;cradle of
civilisation&quot; is nothing more than desert land with &quot;fields&quot; of
pottery that they have the right to take advantage of because, after
all, they are the lords of the land and, as a result, the owners of
its possessions. In the same way, if they had been able, these people
would not have hesitated to take control of the oil fields, because
this is &quot;their land&quot;. Because life in the desert is hard and because
they have been &quot;forgotten&quot; by all the governments, their &quot;revenge&quot; for
this reality is to monitor, and take, every single money-making
opportunity. A cylinder seal, a sculpture or a cuneiform tablet earns
$50 (#25) and that's half the monthly salary of an average government
employee in Iraq. The looters have been told by the traders that if an
object is worth anything at all, it must have an inscription on it. In
Iraq, the farmers consider their &quot;looting&quot; activities to be part of a
normal working day.

(6) How private armies became a $120bn global industry

Making a killing: how private armies became a $120bn global industry

by Daniel Howden and Leonard Doyle in Washington

Published: 21 September 2007

In Nigeria, corporate commandos exchange fire with local rebels
attacking an oil platform. In Afghanistan, private bodyguards help to
foil yet another assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai. In
Colombia, a contracted pilot comes under fire from guerrillas while
spraying coca fields with pesticides. On the border between Iraq and
Iran, privately owned Apache helicopters deliver US special forces to
a covert operation.

This is a snapshot of a working day in the burgeoning world of private
military companies, arguably the fastest-growing industry in the
global economy. The sector is now worth up to $120bn annually with
operations in at least 50 countries, according to Peter Singer, a
security analyst with the Brookings Institution in Washington.

&quot;The rate of growth in the security industry has been phenomenal,&quot;
says Deborah Avant, a professor of political science at UCLA. The
single largest spur to this boom is the conflict in Iraq.

The workings of this industry have come under intense scrutiny this
week in the angry aftermath of the killing of Iraqi civilians by the
US-owned Blackwater corporation in Baghdad. The Iraqi government has
demanded the North Carolina-based company is withdrawn. But with
Blackwater responsible for the protection of hundreds of senior US and
Iraqi officials, from the US ambassador to visiting congressional
delegations, there is certainty in diplomatic and military circles
that this will not happen.

The origins of these shadow armies trace back to the early 1990s and
the end of the Cold War, Bob Ayers, a security expert with Chatham
House in London, explains: &quot;In the good old days of the Cold War there
were two superpowers who kept a lid on everything in their respective
parts of the world.&quot;

He likens the collapse of the Soviet Union to &quot;taking the lid off a
pressure cooker&quot;. What we have seen since, he says, is the rise of
international dissident groups, ultranationalists and multiple threats
to global security.

The new era also saw a significant reduction in the size of the
standing armies, at the same time as a rise in global insecurity which
increased both the availability of military expertise and the demand
for it. It was a business opportunity that could not be ignored.

Now the mercenary trade comes with its own business jargon. Guns for
hire come under the umbrella term of privatised military firms, with
their own acronym PMFs. The industry itself has done everything it can
to shed the &quot;mercenary&quot; tag and most companies avoid the term
&quot;military&quot; in preference for &quot;security&quot;. &quot;The term mercenary is not
accurate,&quot; says Mr Ayers, who argues that military personnel in
defensive roles should be distinguished from soldiers of fortune.

There is nothing new about soldiers for hire, the private companies
simply represent the trade in a new form. &quot;Organised as business
entities and structured along corporate lines, they mark the corporate
evolution of the mercenary trade,&quot; according to Mr Singer, who was
among the first to plot the worldwide explosion in the use of private
military firms.

In many ways it mirrors broader trends in the world economy as
countries switch from manufacturing to services and outsource
functions once thought to be the preserve of the state. Iraq has
become a testing ground for this burgeoning industry, creating
staggering financial opportunities and equally immense ethical dilemmas.

None of the estimated 48,000 private military operatives in Iraq has
been convicted of a crime and no one knows how many Iraqis have been
killed by private military forces, because the US does not keep records.

According to some estimates, more than 800 private military employees
have been killed in the war so far, and as many as 3,300 wounded.
These numbers are greater than the losses suffered by any single US
army division and larger than the casualties suffered by the rest of
the coalition put together.

A high-ranking US military commander in Iraq said: &quot;These guys run
loose in this country and do stupid stuff. There's no authority over
them, so you can't come down on them hard when they escalate force.
They shoot people.&quot;

In Abu Ghraib, all of the translators and up to half of the
interrogators were reportedly private contractors.

Private soldiers are involved in all stages of war, from training and
war-gaming before the invasion to delivering supplies. Camp Doha in
Kuwait, the launch-pad for the invasion, was built by private contractors.

It is not just the military that has turned to the private sector,
humanitarian agencies are dependent on PMFs in almost every war zone
from Bosnia to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Which raises the next
market the industry would like to see opened: peacekeeping. And the
lobbying has already begun. ####

(7) Fears of Dollar Collapse as Saudis Take Fright

Fears of Dollar Collapse as Saudis Take Fright

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

The Telegraph, UK, Thursday 20 September 2007

www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/09/19/bcnsaudi11...

Ben Bernanke has placed the dollar in a dangerous situation, say analysts

&quot;This is a very dangerous situation for the dollar,&quot; said Hans
Redeker, currency chief at BNP Paribas.

&quot;Saudi Arabia has $800bn (#400bn) in their future generation fund, and
the entire region has $3,500bn under management. They face an
inflationary threat and do not want to import an interest rate policy
set for the recessionary conditions in the United States,&quot; he said.

The Saudi central bank said today that it would take &quot;appropriate
measures&quot; to halt huge capital inflows into the country, but analysts
say this policy is unsustainable and will inevitably lead to the
collapse of the dollar peg.

As a close ally of the US, Riyadh has so far tried to stick to the
peg, but the link is now destabilising its own economy.

The Fed's dramatic half point cut to 4.75pc yesterday has already
caused a plunge in the world dollar index to a fifteen year low,
touching with weakest level ever against the mighty euro at just under
$1.40.

There is now a growing danger that global investors will start to shun
the US bond markets. The latest US government data on foreign holdings
released this week show a collapse in purchases of US bonds from $97bn
to just $19bn in July, with outright net sales of US Treasuries.

The danger is that this could now accelerate as the yield gap between
the United States and the rest of the world narrows rapidly, leaving
America starved of foreign capital flows needed to cover its current
account deficit - expected to reach $850bn this year, or 6.5pc of GDP.

Mr Redeker said foreign investors have been gradually pulling out of
the long-term US debt markets, leaving the dollar dependent on
short-term funding. Foreigners have funded 25pc to 30pc of America's
credit and short-term paper markets over the last two years.

&quot;They were willing to provide the money when rates were paying nicely,
but why bear the risk in these dramatically changed circumstances? We
think that a fall in dollar to $1.50 against the euro is not out of
the question at all by the first quarter of 2008,&quot; he said.

&quot;This is nothing like the situation in 1998 when the crisis was in
Asia, but the US was booming. This time the US itself is the problem,&quot;
he said.

Mr Redeker said the biggest danger for the dollar is that falling US
rates will at some point trigger a reversal yen &quot;carry trade&quot;, causing
massive flows from the US back to Japan.

Jim Rogers, the commodity king and former partner of George Soros,
said the Federal Reserve was playing with fire by cutting rates so
aggressively at a time when the dollar was already under pressure.

The risk is that flight from US bonds could push up the long-term
yields that form the base price of credit for most mortgages, the
driving the property market into even deeper crisis.

&quot;If Ben Bernanke starts running those printing presses even faster
than he's already doing, we are going to have a serious recession. The
dollar's going to collapse, the bond market's going to collapse.
There's going to be a lot of problems,&quot; he said.

The Federal Reserve, however, clearly calculates the risk of a sudden
downturn is now so great that the it outweighs dangers of a dollar slide.

Former Fed chief Alan Greenspan said this week that house prices may
fall by &quot;double digits&quot; as the subprime crisis bites harder, prompting
households to cut back sharply on spending.

For Saudi Arabia, the dollar peg has clearly become a liability.
Inflation has risen to 4pc and the M3 broad money supply is surging at
22pc.

The pressures are even worse in other parts of the Gulf. The United
Arab Emirates now faces inflation of 9.3pc, a 20-year high. In Qatar
it has reached 13pc.

Kuwait became the first of the oil sheikhdoms to break its dollar peg
in May, a move that has begun to rein in rampant money supply growth.

Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan: No Coincidence

by Prof. Ira Chernus

Global Research, September 23, 2007

NATO bombs killed at least 45 civilians in Afghanistan the other day.
If you get your news from the front pages of the U.S. mainstream
media, you wouldn't know it. The New York Times did run news from
Afghanistan on its front page the next day  a rather ghoulish piece
about Muslims refusing to give Taliban suicide bombers a religious
burial, because suicide bombing is morally reprehensible. And so it is.

But what about pushing a button in an airplane to drop bombs that fall
on people's homes? Not so reprehensible, apparently. The Times buried
its report on the slaughter in Helmand province back on an inside
page, as did the Washington Post. The LA Times relegated to a &quot;World
in Brief&quot; notice.

If you take the time to read those back-page articles, they all tell
you that NATO faces a dilemma: not a moral dilemma  when Westerners
kill Afghans, the moral issue does not seem to arise  but a strategic
dilemma. On the one hand, &quot;our boys&quot; have to kill Taliban. That's a
given. On the other hand, if we kill too many civilians in the
process, we'll alienate the locals and send them over to the Taliban
side. All the mainstream reports agree that the string of recent
bombings, killing sizeable numbers of civilians, is already creating a
growing problem for NATO's effort to win hearts and minds.

So what's a poor NATO commander to do? American General Dan McNeill,
who took control of all NATO forces in Afghanistan this spring, seems
to have an answer: Bombs away, and let hearts and minds fall where
they may. The spike in civilian deaths from NATO bombs is no
coincidence. It reflects a major change in strategy, which has gone
totally unreported in the American media.

The British public knows about it. Journalists Jason Burke and Robert
Fox think it's a story the Brits need to know, because it could well
put the lives of British  as well as American  NATO troops in
greater danger. And it will put British  as well as American  tax
dollars to work paying for more bombs that kill more innocent civilians.

Senior British officers told these journalists that Gen. McNeill, with
too few troops on the ground to hold off the Taliban offensive, plans
to rely on massive aerial bombing to do the job. &quot;Bomber McNeill,&quot; the
Brits call him bitterly, because they know that his heavy-handed
strategy will be counter-productive in the long run. &quot;Every civilian
dead means five new Taliban,&quot; a British officer recently returned from
southern Afghanistan told Jason Burke. &quot;This could lose the entire
south of the country to the Taliban, alienating them permanently from
the Karzai government and its international supporters,&quot; Robert Fox
adds. &quot;In that case, the future of Hamid Karzai and his nemesis in
Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, looks dim.&quot;

The British are unhappy because they are losing too  losing control
of the Afghan war effort. Before McNeill took command of NATO forces,
they were headed by a British General, David Richards. He focused more
on economic reconstruction and building good relations with the Afghan
people. But the Americans and Karzai criticized him for being too
soft. Now they've got the tough guy they want in charge.

The British saw it coming long ago. Back in December, Robert Fox
reported that Karzai had removed Gen. Richards' local protigi in
Helmand, provincial governor Mohammed Daud. British intelligence
officers and military commanders &quot;blamed pressure from the CIA.  The
Americans knew Daud was a main British ally, yet they deliberately
undermined him and told Karzai to sack him.&quot; Gen. Richards had also
come in for American criticism as &quot;too political,&quot; Fox added. &quot;The
American supreme commander of NATO, General Jim Jones, has let it be
known, according to sources, that General Richards `would have been
sacked if he had been an American officer.'&quot;

Now he's been sacked. So now our tax dollars, and the Brits', will be
used not to win hearts and minds, but to drop bombs that destroy
hearts and minds and lives.

In the U.S., the mainstream media agree that it's all the fault of
those evil Taliban, who attack NATO forces then scurry for cover
inside local villages. The Taliban actually want to get more civilians
kill, we are told, because it helps turn the locals against NATO and
its puppet government in Kabul. It may be true. There is plenty about
the Taliban that is reprehensible. It would be tragic if they returned
to power.

But &quot;Bomber McNeill&quot; would be the first to tell you that, when you are
at war, you use whatever tactics work best. The Taliban are guerilla
fighters. Of course they live and hide among the people. Do we expect
them to fight only in open fields, far away from villages, where NATO
bombers can pick them off effortlessly?

If we want to keep the Taliban out of power, Gen. Richards' &quot;soft&quot;
strategy is the only one that has a chance. Richards and his
supporters say that his strategy was working, that the Taliban made
few real gains last year. Perhaps the Americans, who call the shots,
are afraid of appearing (or feeling) too &quot;soft.&quot; Perhaps they are
impatient.

Or perhaps something else is going on, too. This week Robert Fox
reported that, in addition to stepped up bombing, &quot;there is also to be
a US-led campaign of indiscriminate aerial spraying of poppy fields,
triggered by the UN report that last year's poppy yield was 60 per
cent higher than the year before..&quot; But back in December, when
Mohammed Daud was sacked, he wrote: &quot;Governor Daud was appointed to
replace a man the British accused of involvement in opium trafficking
Mr. Daud, who had survived several Taliban assassination attempts,
was seen as a key player in Britain's anti-drugs campaign in Helmand.&quot;
Will the poppy spraying really be &quot;indiscriminate&quot;? The CIA's
notorious record in poppy-growing regions should make us wonder.

Helmand is Afghanistan's richest opium-producing province. Opium is at
the heart of its economy, and its tangled politics. To get just a
taste of how tangled, check out this long analysis by &quot;Zmarial,&quot; a
resident of Helmand  not necessarily a very objective observer, but
an insider who knows how many different interests are playing against,
and with, each other in the province.

Though Daud was supposedly a key player in the British anti-drug
campaign, this writer notes, &quot;poppy production hit a record level in
2006 while Daud was governor of the province and enjoyed the full
support of Britain.&quot; What's more, he cites one source claiming that
&quot;260 million dollars have been exchanged as bribery between locals and
governmental officials. This is the figure which is tracked, but the
untracked amount is unclear. The survey shows 58% of people who are
anti-government are so because of domestic corruption.&quot; All that money
goes mainly to cover up and protect the opium trade. Can we really
believe that the CIA, so determined to take control from the British
in Helmand, is uninvolved?

It's unlikely that even the best journalist can see the whole picture
in Helmand, much less in all of Afghanistan. It's way too complex. But
NATO bombardiers thousands of feet above the ground certainly don't
know anything about the reality of the towns and villages  and human
lives  they are destroying. They are just following &quot;Bomber
McNeill's&quot; simplistic &quot;good guys&quot; versus &quot;bad guys&quot; script, which the
British find so typically American  with good reason. It's the only
story we are told in our mainstream media.

If we ever have journalists who tell the story in a more complex
realistic way, we'll see that it's the same old story: the more we
take sides in a civil war, the more harm we do, especially when we
rely on massive aerial bombing as our main weapon. A heavy-handed U.S.
intervention in the 1980s helped to create the Taliban. Now another
heavy-handed intervention seems likely to help bring them back to
power  and kill countless civilians along the way. All that (and
perhaps opium too) paid for with our tax dollars.

And as the Afghans bury their dead, the whole story is buried in the
back pages of our newspapers, as if the people our tax dollars killed
just didn't matter very much. While we denounce the immorality of the
