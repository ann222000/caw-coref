Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

A month after Dr. Robert C. Atkins' death, his much-ridiculed diet has
received its most powerful scientific support yet: Two studies in one
of medicine's most distinguished journals show it really does help
people lose weight faster without raising their cholesterol.

The research, in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, found
that people on the high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate Atkins
diet lose twice as much weight over six months as those on the
standard low-fat diet recommended by most major health organizations.

However, one of the studies found that the Atkins dieters regain much
of the weight by the end of one year.

Atkins, who died April 17 at age 72 after falling and hitting his head
on an icy sidewalk, lived to see several shorter studies that found,
to researchers' great surprise, that his diet is effective and healthy
in the short run.

Although those reports have been presented at medical conferences,
none until now has been published in a top-tier journal. And one of
the studies in the journal lasted a year, making it the longest one
yet.

``For the last 20 years that I've been helping people lose weight,
I've been trashing the Atkins diet -- without any real data to rely
on,'' said Dr. Michael Hamilton, an obesity researcher who was not
part of either study. ``Now we have some data to give us some
guidance.''

Now, he said, he would neither trash it nor endorse it. ``I'm going to
say I don't know. The evidence isn't in,'' he said.

One study ran six months and was conducted by the Veterans Affairs
Department; the yearlong study was led by Gary D. Foster, who runs the
weight-loss program at the University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine.

Atkins' diet books have sold 15 million copies since the first one was
published in 1972. From the start, doctors branded the Atkins diet
foolish and dangerous, warning that the large amounts of beef and fat
would lead to sky-high cholesterol levels.

In both studies, the Atkins dieters generally had better levels of
``good'' cholesterol and triglycerides, or fats in the blood. There
was no difference in ``bad'' cholesterol or blood pressure.

Dr. Frederick F. Samaha of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, who led the VA study, said both studies indicate that people
do lose more weight on Atkins, ``but the difference is not great.''

The 132 men and women in the VA study started out weighing an average
of 286 pounds. After six months, those on the Atkins diet had lost an
average of 12.8 pounds, those on the low-fat diet 4.2.

The other study involved 63 participants who weighed an average of 217
pounds at the start. After six months, the Atkins group lost 15.4
pounds, the group on the standard diet 7.

But at the end of a year, the Atkins dieters had regained about a
third of the weight. Their net loss averaged 9.7 pounds. The low-fat
dieters had regained about one-fifth of the weight, for a net loss of
5.5 pounds.

The year-end difference was not big enough to tell whether it was
caused by the diets, Foster said.

About 40 percent of the patients dropped out of each study. And while
supporters of the Atkins diet say it is easier to stick with, people
on the Atkins regimen were just as likely to drop out as people on the
standard diets.

The important finding, Foster said, is that the Atkins diet appears to
be a healthy short-term way to lose weight. Nobody has studied it long
enough to tell whether it is a healthy way to maintain that loss, he
said.

Collette Heimowitz, director of education and research at Atkins
Health and Medical Information Services, said people there were not
surprised by the weight loss and improved cholesterol.

``But I'm thrilled that serious researchers are taking a hard look at
the program, so that health care professionals and physicians would
find comfort in offering Atkins as an alternative to the
one-size-fits-all hypothesis of low-fat, low-calorie,'' she said.

The studies did not convince Kathleen Zelman, a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association.

``There's never been any denying that low-carbohydrate, high-protein
diets such as Atkins do, absolutely, cause weight loss,'' she said.
``But do they hold up over time and can you stay on them over time?''

From Foster's study, it does not look like it, she said.

Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

sentences from the report in today's NY Times:

&quot;The studies, in The New England Journal of Medecine, showed that although
the low-carbohydrate diets were, at best, just marginally more effective for
weight loss, they were associated with lower triglycerides.........&quot;

&quot;The others were given copies of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and told to
follow it..........The dieters lost 16 pounds after a year. That was
greater than the 8-pound loss among the low-fat dieters, but still not a
significant amount, given that the subjects started out weighing an average
of 216 pounds.&quot;

I should have thought that losing twice as much could hardly be called
&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

the best way to lose weight and live a healthy life is moderation in
one's diet and regular excercise. Its really very simple. You have to
burn more calories than you consume in order to lose weight; its simple
physics. What's not simple is finding the mental discipline to maintain
a healthy lifestyle that includes regular and frequent physical activity
and minimizes the consumption of high fat and high carb foods.

The greater majority of medical schools do NOT teach physicians nutrition,
so this study also proves that's a mistake. I can't see how your doctor
thinks (s)he can keep his patients healthy when (s)he doesn't understand
their nutritional needs. Isn't nutrition basic to health?

"/> There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
involves restricting fats and eating more carbs. The food pyramid says
that 60% of your diet should be carbs.

These new studies show that a low-carb, high-fat, high-protein diet is
not only conducive to better weight management, but that it may be
better for the heart.

These studies show that the conventional wisdom in nutrition could be
as wrong as it could be.

We have to re-examine what is a properly &quot;balanced diet&quot;.

This is the beginning of a major paradigm shift in nutrition. Those
who have been attacking Adkins have some serious explaining to do.

&gt;&gt; Depends on a lot of things really. If it were 0.1% and 0.2% that's still
&gt;&gt; double, but would you say that's significant ?

&gt;&gt; In this case it's 7.4% and 3.7% of body weight lost roughly.
&gt;&gt; Tim.

&gt; It depends, I agree, but i said it in the context of the 16 and 8 pound
&gt; losses, which are not inconsiderable. However I find that my information
&gt; may be wrong; I took the numbers from the NY Times, but two other papers,
&gt; USA Today and our local one give the starting group weight as 288 and 286
&gt; respectively. Dunno who to believe these days! Anyway, the point I was
&gt; making is that not just weight loss clinics with some vested interest but
&gt; also doctors and supposedly neutral reporters are having a very hard time
&gt; accepting the conclusions of these studies which is a comment more on how
&gt; difficult it is to change embedded opinions than on the Atkins diet, which
&gt; like most diets presumably works for some and not for others.

"/> You make an excellent point about how many people are against the Atkins
diet becaue the &quot;low fat&quot; mantra is permenently embedded in their minds.
It's hard to blame them, though, because we all have been exposed to the
fat-is-bad dogma from so many apparently reliable sources for so many years.
It's almost as if many people *want* the Atkins diet to be proven
ineffective or unhealthy and they have a difficult time accepting evidence
that it is both effective and healthy. Maybe it's also resentment over years
of oatmeal and skim milk breakfasts when they could have had bacon and eggs

&gt;&gt; Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet
&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;&gt; A month after Dr. Robert C. Atkins' death, his much-ridiculed diet has
&gt;&gt; received its most powerful scientific support yet: Two studies in one
&gt;&gt; of medicine's most distinguished journals show it really does help
&gt;&gt; people lose weight faster without raising their cholesterol.

&gt; This does not fit the conventional wisdom and the way it has been reported
&gt; as well as the reactions of some docs are interesting. Here are two
&gt; sentences from the report in today's NY Times:

&gt;&quot;The studies, in The New England Journal of Medecine, showed that although
&gt; the low-carbohydrate diets were, at best, just marginally more effective for
&gt; weight loss, they were associated with lower triglycerides.........&quot;

&gt;&quot;The others were given copies of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and told to
&gt; follow it..........The dieters lost 16 pounds after a year. That was
&gt; greater than the 8-pound loss among the low-fat dieters, but still not a
&gt; significant amount, given that the subjects started out weighing an average
&gt; of 216 pounds.&quot;

&gt; I should have thought that losing twice as much could hardly be called
&gt;&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

"/> It is always entertaining to count the buts, howevers and althoughs
that are used in these studies.

The reality is that these &quot;doctors&quot; are actually doing real science
now and are not finding what they have been asserting for over a
hundred years.

Dietary fat is not the enemy. (Refined) Dietary carbs are not our
friends. Macro-nutrient ratio is as important a factor as overall
calories consumed. The human body is not a static and closed system
with a simple calorie-in/calorie-out weight management equation. There
is a little bit more to weight management than calories.

Simple and common-sensical enough concepts.

Now if the idiots who have kept us in the dark for all these years
would look at and accept this obvious and real evidence, we can get on
with real scientific progress.

"/> Heehee! It's interesting that reducing carbs was the conventional way to
lose weight when I was a youngster, which is a *very* long time ago. Later
came the demonisation of fat and protein and the beatification of carbs.
The wheel keeps turning. My belief is that folks should find the diet and
exercise program, (or lack thereof), that suits them individually and ignore
the changing fashions. And if someone is comfortable being fat, really so
what? Unless of course it's someone i'm sitting next to on a plane.

&gt; Everyone is looking for a gimick; a quick fix to lose weight. I agree,

&gt; one's diet and regular excercise. Its really very simple. You have to
&gt; burn more calories than you consume in order to lose weight; its simple
&gt; physics. What's not simple is finding the mental discipline to maintain
&gt; a healthy lifestyle that includes regular and frequent physical activity
&gt; and minimizes the consumption of high fat and high carb foods.

into the same group. THAT is the problem these studies had. And an awful

face value, and the original studies were forgotten to have clumped together
sat- &amp; trans- fats.

And a god-awful lot of that &quot;good evidence&quot; also has weight loss evident,
but still proposes that it was the reduction of eating sat-fat that caused
the
positive changes.

4 years ago I started thinking it would take about 10 more years for the

track,
maybe even a tad faster. Which is nice.

&gt;&gt; now and are not finding what they have been asserting for over a
&gt;&gt; hundred years.

&gt;&gt; Dietary fat is not the enemy. (Refined) Dietary carbs are not our
&gt;&gt; friends. Macro-nutrient ratio is as important a factor as overall
&gt;&gt; calories consumed. The human body is not a static and closed system
&gt;&gt; with a simple calorie-in/calorie-out weight management equation. There
&gt;&gt; is a little bit more to weight management than calories.

&gt;&gt; Simple and common-sensical enough concepts.

&gt;&gt; Now if the idiots who have kept us in the dark for all these years
&gt;&gt; would look at and accept this obvious and real evidence, we can get on
&gt;&gt; with real scientific progress.

&gt; I agree with you except that it is most certainly not &quot;Simple and
&gt; common-sensical.&quot; It is not simple because understanding how and why Atkins
&gt; works requires some understanding of metabolism and biochemistry, something
&gt; that is not exactly widespread in the population. And it is, if anything,
&gt; against common sense which would seem to tell us &quot;eat fat, get fat&quot; and &quot;a
&gt; calorie is a calorie no matter where it comes from.&quot; This is yet another in
&gt; a long line of examples showing that &quot;common sense&quot; is often wrong.

&gt; Peter G. Aitken

"/> The &quot;dietary fat - body fat&quot; terminology is very unfortunate. It may
be partially responsible for people refusing to consider fat as
anything but the source of weight/fat gain.

Most nutrition or bio-chemistry textbooks state in the first chapter
that carbohydrates are converted to fat. Yet in later chapters they
get into the calorie bulls**t and the lesson learned in chapter one is
completely lost.

As far as low-carb being against common sense. If you look at the huge
amounts of sugars and refined carbs that are being eaten such as
cereals, sodas, potato chips, french fries, pizza dough, bread,
crackers, etc., and then you look at the food pyramid that advocates
60% carbs, and then you see how Americans are getting fatter and
fatter and fatter, you really have to see how carbs are the primary
problem.

These studies are saying something important. Hopefully, the
intelligentsia of the nutritional sciences will follow the scent to
its conclusion. I suspect most will try to simply rationalize it away.

It's gotta be damned hard to say that they've been so wrong for so
long. But that is their problem. The longer they hold out the stupider
they will look in the end.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet
&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;&gt;&gt; A month after Dr. Robert C. Atkins' death, his much-ridiculed diet has
&gt;&gt;&gt; received its most powerful scientific support yet: Two studies in one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of medicine's most distinguished journals show it really does help
&gt;&gt;&gt; people lose weight faster without raising their cholesterol.

&gt;&gt; This does not fit the conventional wisdom and the way it has been reported
&gt;&gt; as well as the reactions of some docs are interesting. Here are two
&gt;&gt; sentences from the report in today's NY Times:

&gt;&gt;&quot;The studies, in The New England Journal of Medecine, showed that although
&gt;&gt; the low-carbohydrate diets were, at best, just marginally more effective for
&gt;&gt; weight loss, they were associated with lower triglycerides.........&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;The others were given copies of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and told to
&gt;&gt; follow it..........The dieters lost 16 pounds after a year. That was
&gt;&gt; greater than the 8-pound loss among the low-fat dieters, but still not a
&gt;&gt; significant amount, given that the subjects started out weighing an average
&gt;&gt; of 216 pounds.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I should have thought that losing twice as much could hardly be called
&gt;&gt;&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

&gt; What also was not reported is that these are not the first studies that
&gt; have shown such results. There have already been about half a dozen
&gt; with remarkably consistent results - more weight loss, improved blood
&gt; lipid profile, and improved blood glucose levels. Its really hard to
&gt; reconcile these results with the standard low-fat dogma that saturated fat
&gt; will increase your chances of a heart attack.

"/> There has also been studies suggesting that fully one third of those
dying of heart disease never suffered from high levels of cholesterol
in the blood. Cholesterol having supposedly been linked to high-fat
diets.

And more than 90% of them had high levels of Homocysteine which is
linked to low levels of some B vitamins. A diet with little fresh
vegetables and too much overly processed foods lead to low levels of B
vitamins.

This may explain why a high-fat diet may not necessarily lead to
increase in heart disease as was predicted by every anti-Atkins
nutritionist and doctor.

Well, they appear to be wrong.....again.

&gt; You make an excellent point about how many people are against the Atkins
&gt; diet becaue the &quot;low fat&quot; mantra is permenently embedded in their minds.
&gt; It's hard to blame them, though, because we all have been exposed to the
&gt; fat-is-bad dogma from so many apparently reliable sources for so many years.
&gt; It's almost as if many people *want* the Atkins diet to be proven
&gt; ineffective or unhealthy and they have a difficult time accepting evidence
&gt; that it is both effective and healthy. Maybe it's also resentment over years
&gt; of oatmeal and skim milk breakfasts when they could have had bacon and eggs
&gt;&lt;g&gt;!

"/> Yeah, they could have had stilted their cholesterol, nitrates, and
omega fatty acid imbalances even further. However, I could see one
argument in favor of an Atkins diet here: Low carb intake means
essentially eliminating one route for cholesterol biosynthesis.

The trend today would advocate the mantra &quot;*bad* fat is bad&quot; (and I
think the upcoming revised USDA food pyramid poses this). So, along
those lines, I wonder what the Atkins diet says about the fat ratio
among saturated, mono-unsaturated, and poly-unsaturated fats.

&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
&gt;&gt; the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
&gt;&gt; minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

&gt;&gt; John Gaughan
&gt;&gt; j ... @johngaughan.net

&gt; There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

&gt; For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
&gt; involves restricting fats and eating more carbs.

"/> Untrue. The &quot;saturated fat/heart disease&quot; theory has only been
around since the 1950's. Prior to that, heart disease was generally
thought to be caused by an infection. Now, with the discovery of the
strong link between C-Reactive Proteins (a sign of infection) and
heart disease and what appears to be the impending demise of the
saturated fat/cholesterol link, it appears that the old theory may
be right after all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The food pyramid says
&gt; that 60% of your diet should be carbs.

&gt; These new studies show that a low-carb, high-fat, high-protein diet is
&gt; not only conducive to better weight management, but that it may be
&gt; better for the heart.

&gt; These studies show that the conventional wisdom in nutrition could be
&gt; as wrong as it could be.

&gt; We have to re-examine what is a properly &quot;balanced diet&quot;.

&gt; This is the beginning of a major paradigm shift in nutrition. Those
&gt; who have been attacking Adkins have some serious explaining to do.

For me, there's a more important aspect to this whole ongoing diet debate than
the business about what diet is healthiest. That's the psychological part about
why some people need diets in the first place.

Say you have 2 women. They're the same age and height and socio-economic
background. They work in the same place. One has been battling her weight
since she was a teenager. We'll call her Miss Plump. The other has never had
much of a weight problem. She eats pretty much what she feels like and stays
thin. We'll call her Miss Lucky. They go out to eat together and both order
the special which consists of a chef's salad, a bowl of minestrone and ice tea.
This isn't a diet meal or anything. It is a good one. The salad is good and
fresh. The soup is perfectly seasoned and piping hot. It isn't necessarily a
low-fat meal since there's butter on the garlic bread with the soup, and there's
cheese in the chef's salad plus dressing. Neither is it a high-protein meal
with all those vegetables though there is a little meat in the salad.

Miss Plump eats the meal because it fits on her calorie counting diet with the
right number of fat points. Miss Lucky eats it because she loves good hot soup
and garlic bread and never makes a salad that tasty at home. Miss Plump eats
the meal and feels deprived. She'd rather have had a cheeseburger and
milkshake, but she's virtuously sticking to her diet. Miss Lucky loves the
restaurant and is thinking she'd like to go back. Miss Plump is hungry again at
3:00p hours before time to leave work. She tries to muster up the willpower to
resist the vending machines near the office, but by 4:00p she gives up and buys
herself a chocolate bar followed by a Dove bar. Miss Lucky is so stuffed from
that great lunch that she has no desire for candy or anything else. She rarely
eats chocolate except for 3 days out of the month at which point she eats it
with no guilt and no ill effect.

For Miss Plump, eating is all about willpower. For Miss Lucky, eating is all
about joy. What explains the difference? Miss Lucky isn't necessarily a more
disciplined person. In fact, in every other aspect of their lives, Miss Plump
is more disciplined. She's more likely to be on time; she does a better job;
she gets assignments done on time; she keeps to budget. Miss Lucky is far more
lackadaisical. She's frequently late and disorganized, terrible about getting
exercise and flossing her teeth.

I'll drive the point home. I'm more like Miss Lucky when it comes to food. I
eat what I like mostly. I do remind myself to eat more vegetables, but that's
about it. I'm not overweight, and my numbers on cholesterol and blood pressure
are well within normal. If you offer me one piece of cheesecake, I'll eat it
and love it and ask for the recipe. If you offer me seconds right away, I'll
turn it down, not because I'm exhibiting admirable willpower, but because at
that moment the cheesecake looks awful to me. I don't want it. The thought of
eating it nauseates me. Why? Why do I get queasy at the thought of stuffing
myself like that when Miss Plump limits herself to one thin slice and then wants
more?

The answer seems to have something to do with cultural attitudes towards food,
something to do with early childhood training, something to do with metabolism
and weight set points and a history of dieting, but none of that really answers
it for me. Nor do all these studies about Atkins and Dean Ornish and
macrobiotics and carbohydrates and calories. Why does Miss Plump even need a
diet?

&gt; I am no expert, but isn't a balanced diet, one where fats, protein, and
&gt; carbs are consumed in balance, wherein, we eat the amount of those
&gt; components that we need. For example, someone who runs a few minutes per
&gt; day on a regular basis will need more carbs than proteins, so it makes
&gt; sense to me, that someone who is sedentary needs more proteins and fats
&gt; than carbs. As we all know, no all fats are created equal.

"/>  The term &quot;balanced diet&quot; originated from the USDA's previous
diet recommendations - the &quot;Four Food Groups&quot; - meat, fruit and vegetables,
dairy, bread and grains. A &quot;balanced&quot; diet was one where you had a roughly
equal amount from each group. The Four Food Groups went out the window
with the introduction of the infamous Food Pyramid in 1982.
Today, the term &quot;balanced&quot; diet is a completely subjective term that
is almost completely meaningless, depending entirely on what the
speaker's beliefs on proper nutrition are. When someone says you should
eat a &quot;balanced&quot; diet, what they are really saying is that you should
eat a nutritious diet - based on what they believe proper nutrition is.

A comment, sort of, that may partly answer the question above: Myself,
I was obese and still technically am, but I'm now 1.5 pounds away from severely
overweight (at least according to the definitions I'm relying on). People
invariably ask what diet I'm on, and I try to explain that I'm not on a diet,
but I have changed my behavior. Simply put, I'm still eating what I like,
though probably a lot more balanced, but I watch my portion sizes and watch my
total calories consumed. That is the most significant change I made, and
probably the second most significant change, I think, is including whole grains
(oatmeal, brown rice, whole-grain rye bread, wholemeal cornbread....) with every
meal, which seem to keep me from feeling hungry.

My non-expert opinion is that &quot;Miss Plump&quot; doesn't necessarily need the
diet, but the diet gives her the structure she needs to change her behavior and
limit calories. For me, the structure is a food diary and I chart my weight,
which keeps me aware of what I'm eating. I know the worst thing I could do is
stop thinking about what I'm eating and start again eating whenever the mood
strikes me.

Like many other's, I tend to eat for reasons other than because I'm
hungry. That's the behavior I've had to change. I think that's the difference
between &quot;Miss Plump&quot; and &quot;Miss Thin,&quot; though I could be wrong, and certainly
there are exceptions.

Well, as a clinical RD the area of weight loss is of special interest to me.
I deal with the Mr and Miss Plump all of the time. Our society is far too
judgmental of weight. While I do not approve of obesity, wt loss has many
aspects having to do with genetics, lifestyle, enviroment and wanting to
lose weight. Having been a Miss Plump I understand the frustration of
seeing Miss Skinny eat anything and not gain weight and Miss plump can't
pass by a dessert table without gainign weight. I teach my clients about an
overall healthy diet and lifestyle. None of the popular diets are advocated
in my office. I also encourage skinny people to not be ugly or judgemental
to overweight people. This does not encourae them to lose weight, it just
makes them feel bad about themselves.

Congrats on being a Miss Skinny, you are very lucky Lia.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is always entertaining to count the buts, howevers and althoughs
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are used in these studies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reality is that these &quot;doctors&quot; are actually doing real science
&gt;&gt;&gt; now and are not finding what they have been asserting for over a
&gt;&gt;&gt; hundred years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dietary fat is not the enemy. (Refined) Dietary carbs are not our
&gt;&gt;&gt; friends. Macro-nutrient ratio is as important a factor as overall
&gt;&gt;&gt; calories consumed. The human body is not a static and closed system
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a simple calorie-in/calorie-out weight management equation. There
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a little bit more to weight management than calories.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Simple and common-sensical enough concepts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now if the idiots who have kept us in the dark for all these years
&gt;&gt;&gt; would look at and accept this obvious and real evidence, we can get on
&gt;&gt;&gt; with real scientific progress.

&gt;&gt; I agree with you except that it is most certainly not &quot;Simple and
&gt;&gt; common-sensical.&quot; It is not simple because understanding how and why Atkins
&gt;&gt; works requires some understanding of metabolism and biochemistry, something
&gt;&gt; that is not exactly widespread in the population. And it is, if anything,
&gt;&gt; against common sense which would seem to tell us &quot;eat fat, get fat&quot; and &quot;a
&gt;&gt; calorie is a calorie no matter where it comes from.&quot; This is yet another in
&gt;&gt; a long line of examples showing that &quot;common sense&quot; is often wrong.

&gt;&gt; Peter G. Aitken

&gt;The &quot;dietary fat - body fat&quot; terminology is very unfortunate. It may
&gt;be partially responsible for people refusing to consider fat as
&gt;anything but the source of weight/fat gain.

"/> Any calories eaten in excess to needs, causes fat gain. I thought this
was common knowledge. Fat just has more than twice as many calories as
anything else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Most nutrition or bio-chemistry textbooks state in the first chapter
&gt;that carbohydrates are converted to fat.

"/> Everything is if eaten in excess. What's new?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Yet in later chapters they
&gt;get into the calorie bulls**t and the lesson learned in chapter one is
&gt;completely lost.

"/> The lesson, or your misreading? Name the book where the first chapter
states that ALL carbs are converted to fat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As far as low-carb being against common sense. If you look at the huge
&gt;amounts of sugars and refined carbs that are being eaten such as
&gt;cereals, sodas, potato chips, french fries, pizza dough, bread,
&gt;crackers, etc., and then you look at the food pyramid that advocates
&gt;60% carbs, and then you see how Americans are getting fatter and
&gt;fatter and fatter, you really have to see how carbs are the primary
&gt;problem.

"/> How much fat is in the foods you mention, and how much extra fat are
Americans eating, but that doesn't address your misapprehension that
ALL excess calories don't put on fat storage.
Americans are eating more and doing less. End of story.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;These studies are saying something important.

"/> I thought they were saying pretty much nothing new.
Are you reading them with the same glasses that you read that text
book with?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Hopefully, the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A month after Dr. Robert C. Atkins' death, his much-ridiculed diet has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; received its most powerful scientific support yet: Two studies in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of medicine's most distinguished journals show it really does help
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people lose weight faster without raising their cholesterol.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This does not fit the conventional wisdom and the way it has been reported
&gt;&gt;&gt; as well as the reactions of some docs are interesting. Here are two
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences from the report in today's NY Times:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The studies, in The New England Journal of Medecine, showed that although
&gt;&gt;&gt; the low-carbohydrate diets were, at best, just marginally more effective for
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight loss, they were associated with lower triglycerides.........&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The others were given copies of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and told to
&gt;&gt;&gt; follow it..........The dieters lost 16 pounds after a year. That was
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater than the 8-pound loss among the low-fat dieters, but still not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant amount, given that the subjects started out weighing an average
&gt;&gt;&gt; of 216 pounds.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I should have thought that losing twice as much could hardly be called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

&gt;&gt; What also was not reported is that these are not the first studies that
&gt;&gt; have shown such results. There have already been about half a dozen
&gt;&gt; with remarkably consistent results - more weight loss, improved blood
&gt;&gt; lipid profile, and improved blood glucose levels. Its really hard to
&gt;&gt; reconcile these results with the standard low-fat dogma that saturated fat
&gt;&gt; will increase your chances of a heart attack.

&gt;There has also been studies suggesting that fully one third of those
&gt;dying of heart disease never suffered from high levels of cholesterol
&gt;in the blood. Cholesterol having supposedly been linked to high-fat
&gt;diets.

"/> No, obesity, usually. Caused by too many calories, dontcha know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And more than 90% of them had high levels of Homocysteine which is
&gt;linked to low levels of some B vitamins.
&gt;A diet with little fresh
&gt;vegetables and too much overly processed foods lead to low levels of B
&gt;vitamins.

"/> I'm sure you are right. Hence the blanket public health measures to
fortify bread and beer with thiamine, and so on, and the advice to
take a multivitamin &quot;just in case&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This may explain why a high-fat diet may not necessarily lead to
&gt;increase in heart disease as was predicted by every anti-Atkins
&gt;nutritionist and doctor.

"/> It's not the fat so much as the obesity, and fat having two and a half
times the calories as anything else, is the first empty calorie to
eliminate. Of course this does not give the often taken licence to pig
out on everything else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Well, they appear to be wrong.....again.

"/> No, you are STILL wrong. Where's the evidence?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
&gt;&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

&gt;&gt;&gt; John Gaughan
&gt;&gt;&gt; j ... @johngaughan.net

&gt;&gt; There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

&gt;&gt; For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
&gt;&gt; involves restricting fats and eating more carbs.

&gt;Untrue. The &quot;saturated fat/heart disease&quot; theory has only been
&gt;around since the 1950's. Prior to that, heart disease was generally
&gt;thought to be caused by an infection. Now, with the discovery of the
&gt;strong link between C-Reactive Proteins (a sign of infection) and
&gt;heart disease and what appears to be the impending demise of the
&gt;saturated fat/cholesterol link, it appears that the old theory may
&gt;be right after all.

"/> That's fascinating, isn't it.

Care to guess what the mantra will be in another 50 years? :)

&gt;For me, there's a more important aspect to this whole ongoing diet debate than
&gt;the business about what diet is healthiest. That's the psychological part about
&gt;why some people need diets in the first place.

"/> That's the hard bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Say you have 2 women. They're the same age and height and socio-economic
&gt;background. They work in the same place. One has been battling her weight
&gt;since she was a teenager. We'll call her Miss Plump. The other has never had
&gt;much of a weight problem. She eats pretty much what she feels like and stays
&gt;thin. We'll call her Miss Lucky. They go out to eat together and both order
&gt;the special which consists of a chef's salad, a bowl of minestrone and ice tea.
&gt;This isn't a diet meal or anything. It is a good one. The salad is good and
&gt;fresh. The soup is perfectly seasoned and piping hot. It isn't necessarily a
&gt;low-fat meal since there's butter on the garlic bread with the soup, and there's
&gt;cheese in the chef's salad plus dressing. Neither is it a high-protein meal
&gt;with all those vegetables though there is a little meat in the salad.

&gt;Miss Plump eats the meal because it fits on her calorie counting diet with the
&gt;right number of fat points.

"/> What are &quot;fat points&quot;? Calories?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Miss Lucky eats it because she loves good hot soup
&gt;and garlic bread and never makes a salad that tasty at home. Miss Plump eats
&gt;the meal and feels deprived.

"/> There's the nub of the problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;She'd rather have had a cheeseburger and
&gt;milkshake, but she's virtuously sticking to her diet. Miss Lucky loves the
&gt;restaurant and is thinking she'd like to go back. Miss Plump is hungry again at
&gt;3:00p hours before time to leave work. She tries to muster up the willpower to
&gt;resist the vending machines near the office, but by 4:00p she gives up and buys
&gt;herself a chocolate bar followed by a Dove bar. Miss Lucky is so stuffed from
&gt;that great lunch that she has no desire for candy or anything else. She rarely
&gt;eats chocolate except for 3 days out of the month at which point she eats it
&gt;with no guilt and no ill effect.

&gt;For Miss Plump, eating is all about willpower. For Miss Lucky, eating is all
&gt;about joy. What explains the difference? Miss Lucky isn't necessarily a more
&gt;disciplined person. In fact, in every other aspect of their lives, Miss Plump
&gt;is more disciplined. She's more likely to be on time; she does a better job;
&gt;she gets assignments done on time; she keeps to budget. Miss Lucky is far more
&gt;lackadaisical. She's frequently late and disorganized, terrible about getting
&gt;exercise and flossing her teeth.

"/> Miss plump has a psychological problem of unknown aetiology (to me).
Maybe she has the genes to always crave food for survival, of food was
used as a comfort when she was a baby. I have a female relative ~30
who was apparently fat as a teenager, but is skinny as a rake now and
is constantly eating anything she can get her hands on. She sleeps in
between eating. I have suggested &quot;tape worm&quot; :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'll drive the point home. I'm more like Miss Lucky when it comes to food. I
&gt;eat what I like mostly. I do remind myself to eat more vegetables, but that's
&gt;about it. I'm not overweight, and my numbers on cholesterol and blood pressure
&gt;are well within normal. If you offer me one piece of cheesecake, I'll eat it
&gt;and love it and ask for the recipe. If you offer me seconds right away, I'll
&gt;turn it down, not because I'm exhibiting admirable willpower, but because at
&gt;that moment the cheesecake looks awful to me. I don't want it. The thought of
&gt;eating it nauseates me. Why? Why do I get queasy at the thought of stuffing
&gt;myself like that when Miss Plump limits herself to one thin slice and then wants
&gt;more?

"/> Many possible factors. Genetics, plumpness, psychology...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The answer seems to have something to do with cultural attitudes towards food,
&gt;something to do with early childhood training, something to do with metabolism
&gt;and weight set points and a history of dieting, but none of that really answers
&gt;it for me. Nor do all these studies about Atkins and Dean Ornish and
&gt;macrobiotics and carbohydrates and calories. Why does Miss Plump even need a
&gt;diet?

"/> That's the problem with multifactorial disabilities. You can't just

&gt;fat is burned for energy or is deposited in your arteries and on your waist.

fat is burned for energy or is deposited in your arteries and on your

&gt;&gt;&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

&gt;What also was not reported is that these are not the first studies that
&gt;have shown such results. There have already been about half a dozen
&gt;with remarkably consistent results - more weight loss, improved blood
&gt;lipid profile, and improved blood glucose levels. Its really hard to
&gt;reconcile these results with the standard low-fat dogma that saturated fat
&gt;will increase your chances of a heart attack.

"/> And the long term consequences of high fat diets?

Weight loss by any means will vastly improve metabolism when the
weight is lost. If you are still obese, you will still have problems.
A carb restricted diet needs the first 20 lbs of water loss subtracted
before the weight loss can be regarded as truely fat loss.

&gt;&gt; It depends, I agree, but i said it in the context of the 16 and 8 pound

&gt;&gt; making is that not just weight loss clinics with some vested interest but
&gt;&gt; also doctors and supposedly neutral reporters are having a very hard time
&gt;&gt; accepting the conclusions of these studies which is a comment more on how
&gt;&gt; difficult it is to change embedded opinions than on the Atkins diet, which
&gt;&gt; like most diets presumably works for some and not for others.

&gt;It's hard to blame them, though, because we all have been exposed to the
&gt;fat-is-bad dogma from so many apparently reliable sources for so many years.
&gt;It's almost as if many people *want* the Atkins diet to be proven

When I wrote &quot;fat points,&quot; I was thinking of how many diets use gimmicks to
help/hinder the dieter to remember what and how much to eat. They'll say
something along the lines of &quot;eat 2 glasses of milk or substitute 1 cheese card
off the blue diet sheet every other day before switching to the maintenance plan
which allows 1 slice of bread OR cereal to make up your total breakfast points
for Wednesdays.&quot; You get the idea.

I agree that the differences between the fictional Misses Plump and Lucky are
psychological, unknown and many. I'd like to take the conversation in a
different direction. Why is the national discussion all about low-fat,
high-carb, Atkins, Ornish and calories when troubles with weight always seem to
boil down the psychological differences or genetic ones? Isn't that where the
research should be?

As for top posting, I rarely scroll through a screen's worth of quoted text in
order to get to the new stuff on the bottom. Top posting or bottom posting
makes little difference. Trimming the previous discussion is what's important.

&gt; My non-expert opinion is that &quot;Miss Plump&quot; doesn't necessarily need the

&gt; which keeps me aware of what I'm eating. I know the worst thing I could do is

recipies, while almost anybody can broil a delicious steak and other
high-fat foods. My brother (MD) believes that the studies are wrong
when they say that people on Atkins-like diets consumed as many
calories as those on low-fat diets since people are more likely to
cheat on the latter. In other words, decreases in blood chloesterol
and fats were due to eating less. Also my shrink says that people
often eat more foul-tasting food because they can't satisfy their
cravings for flavor with them.

The medical establishment has long scorned Atkins because he just
hasn't acted like an honest scientist. He's lied about his
credentials, calling himself a cardiologist when in reality he has no
legitimate board certification in that specialty and was never a
cardiological resident. He hasn't published a single paper in a
recognized scientific journal, and he hasn't done a single clinical
study of his diet, always claiming that there wasn't enough money,
despite well over $100 million in revenue from his books and other
products.

The medical establishment has also long known that a high fat diet
won't cause most people to keel over and die because most people in
the U.S. and northern Europe consume an Atkins-like 40% of their
calories from fat. They've also been critical of extremely low fat
diets, such as Nathan Pritikins, citing the lack of clear advantages
for the average person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is, what exactly is a &quot;healthy, balanced diet&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; A healthy balanced diet supplies all the needed nutrients with a minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt; of fat and carbs.

&gt;&gt;According to these and a couple of other studies, it appears that a
&gt;&gt;low-carb, high-fat, high-protein diet is closer to a balanced diet
&gt;&gt;than a low-fat, high-carb diet.

&gt; Neither are &quot;balanced&quot;. A varied, wholefood diet with something from
&gt; all the food groups is the only balanced diet.

"/> A balance diet is not necessarily a diet that contains all the foods
available to us. Just because we have a huge variety of foods in a
given diet does not automatically make it balanced.

A balanced diet is a diet that contains the right amounts of the foods
(read macro-nutrients) the body *needs*.

If the body does not need grains, it doesn't. Including grains in the
diet, whole or not, may add variety, but it doesn't necessarily help
the &quot;balance&quot;.

A balanced diet will contain the right amount of protein for the
bodies needs. It will also contain the right amount of fat and carbs
for optimum nutrition. Therefore, by definition, it is not &quot;low&quot; or
&quot;High&quot; in any one area.

It just may be low-carb in relation to the generally accepted
recomendations. Or high in proteins and/or fat. Again, only in
relation to the recomendations of the food pyramid. It is all
relative.

As an aside, it should also provide adequate vitamins and minerals,
and if not, we should be aware of it and supplement as necessary.

&gt;&gt; There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

&gt;&gt; For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
&gt;&gt; involves restricting fats and eating more carbs.

&gt; Untrue. The &quot;saturated fat/heart disease&quot; theory has only been
&gt; around since the 1950's. Prior to that, heart disease was generally
&gt; thought to be caused by an infection. Now, with the discovery of the
&gt; strong link between C-Reactive Proteins (a sign of infection) and
&gt; heart disease and what appears to be the impending demise of the
&gt; saturated fat/cholesterol link, it appears that the old theory may
&gt; be right after all.

"/> In around the 1890's, a certain William Banting propounded a low-carb
approach for weight loss. The nutritional &quot;experts&quot; at the time nearly
lynched him. Do a google search on it. Interesting reading.

as I said &quot;over a hundred years&quot; .....

"/>  You're welcome for the answer, but I'm not a success story, yet. I've
gained and lost weight before, and losing it is the easy part. The hard part is
keeping it off. And as most seem to be aware, &quot;diets&quot; ultimately fail (the
dieter puts the weight back on) because the dieter ultimately can't or won't
stay on the diet forever.

To address the question in your later post, I don't know why media
reports and discussions such as these here always focus on the composition of a
&quot;diet&quot; and often do not even touch on any of the other factors of a weight loss
process, such as psychological/behavioral issues. But you could pick anything
else, politics, the economy, take your pick, and also ask yourself why the
debates are always so shallow. It seems to be the same old rule about lowest
common denominators and that sort of thing.

In my opinion, people who are seriously overweight because they simply
eat too much need to be told that no diet is going to solve their problem. I
think in some ways we are similar to the alchoholic who will always be an
alchoholic and every day must fight the urge to take a drink. That's the way I
feel about the way I can go off the deep end when it comes to food.

only dopaminergic drugs (cocaine) can have much more powerful signals
to run the code.

The author of the second study noted that the atkins diet at 6 months

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A month after Dr. Robert C. Atkins' death, his much-ridiculed diet
has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; received its most powerful scientific support yet: Two studies in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of medicine's most distinguished journals show it really does help
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people lose weight faster without raising their cholesterol.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This does not fit the conventional wisdom and the way it has been
reported
&gt;&gt;&gt; as well as the reactions of some docs are interesting. Here are two
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences from the report in today's NY Times:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The studies, in The New England Journal of Medecine, showed that
although
&gt;&gt;&gt; the low-carbohydrate diets were, at best, just marginally more
effective for
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight loss, they were associated with lower triglycerides.........&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The others were given copies of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution and
told to
&gt;&gt;&gt; follow it..........The dieters lost 16 pounds after a year. That was
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater than the 8-pound loss among the low-fat dieters, but still not
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant amount, given that the subjects started out weighing an
average
&gt;&gt;&gt; of 216 pounds.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I should have thought that losing twice as much could hardly be called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;marginally more effective&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot;.

&gt;&gt;What is remarkable and particularly newsworthy is the triglycerides
&gt;&gt;finding. Nearly every nutritionist and their grandmother was swearing
&gt;&gt;that cholersterol and triglycerides would fly through the roof.

&gt; From losing weight? Where?

&gt;&gt;In
&gt;&gt;fact, the blood work of Atkins participants were better than their
&gt;&gt;low-fat adherents.

&gt; And they were still overweight? And the differences in blood levels
&gt; was significant?

&gt;&gt;These studies were initiated to bury the Atkins diet once and for all.
&gt;&gt; As it stands now, the opposite has occurred.

&gt; Really? I thought they told us nothing new.

"/> No, the studies tell us you are wrong.......right? MooShe.
Right??

&gt;and it works. It's not a starvation diet like Atkins (which is a

&gt;lifestyle change, but not a difficult one. At least not for me.

&gt;&gt; Any calories eaten in excess to needs, causes fat gain. I thought this

&gt;&gt;&gt;Most nutrition or bio-chemistry textbooks state in the first chapter

&gt;&gt; Everything is if eaten in excess. What's new?

&gt;Carbs in particular. Not so much proteins and fats. They *are*

"/> And what happens differently to their calories?
You seem to attribute different properties to calories dependant on

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet in later chapters they

&gt;&gt; states that ALL carbs are converted to fat.

&gt;Not all.

"/> Well you *said* all.
Of course it is possible to convert carb to fat. You can convert
protein to fat. It is how the body stores much of its excess calorie
intake.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But they are more *easily* converted to fat.

"/> Than what? Fat? You are joking, No?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Again, fats
&gt;carbs and proteins are metabolized in different ways.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as low-carb being against common sense. If you look at the huge
&gt;&gt;&gt;amounts of sugars and refined carbs that are being eaten such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;cereals, sodas, potato chips, french fries, pizza dough, bread,
&gt;&gt;&gt;crackers, etc., and then you look at the food pyramid that advocates
&gt;&gt;&gt;60% carbs, and then you see how Americans are getting fatter and
&gt;&gt;&gt;fatter and fatter, you really have to see how carbs are the primary
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem.

&gt;&gt; How much fat is in the foods you mention, and how much extra fat are
&gt;&gt; Americans eating, but that doesn't address your misapprehension that
&gt;&gt; ALL excess calories don't put on fat storage.
&gt;&gt; Americans are eating more and doing less. End of story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
&gt;&gt;&gt; involves restricting fats and eating more carbs.

&gt;&gt; Untrue. The &quot;saturated fat/heart disease&quot; theory has only been
&gt;&gt; around since the 1950's. Prior to that, heart disease was generally
&gt;&gt; thought to be caused by an infection. Now, with the discovery of the
&gt;&gt; strong link between C-Reactive Proteins (a sign of infection) and
&gt;&gt; heart disease and what appears to be the impending demise of the
&gt;&gt; saturated fat/cholesterol link, it appears that the old theory may
&gt;&gt; be right after all.

&gt;In around the 1890's, a certain William Banting propounded a low-carb
&gt;approach for weight loss. The nutritional &quot;experts&quot; at the time nearly
&gt;lynched him. Do a google search on it. Interesting reading.

&gt;as I said &quot;over a hundred years&quot; .....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is, what exactly is a &quot;healthy, balanced diet&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A healthy balanced diet supplies all the needed nutrients with a minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of fat and carbs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;According to these and a couple of other studies, it appears that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;low-carb, high-fat, high-protein diet is closer to a balanced diet
&gt;&gt;&gt;than a low-fat, high-carb diet.

&gt;&gt; Neither are &quot;balanced&quot;. A varied, wholefood diet with something from
&gt;&gt; all the food groups is the only balanced diet.

&gt;A balance diet is not necessarily a diet that contains all the foods
&gt;available to us. Just because we have a huge variety of foods in a
&gt;given diet does not automatically make it balanced.

"/> Is a calorie a calorie no matter where it comes from?
Remember, the quantification of calories in food stuffs was very
tenuously done. These numbers were essentially, in many cases, guessed
at. A flame was put to the food and a number of calculations were
performed on the results. Mathematical factors were guessed at and
applied to make it all work. Not all fats are exactly 9 kcal, not all
carbs are exactly 4 kcal and not all proteins are exactly 4 kcal. The
researchers who quantified the caloric values of food gave many
caveats about the usefulness of their numbers and the methodologies
used to calculate them.

Also is a calorie a calorie regardless of the state of the human body?
What happens to the calorie when the body is in a state of great
hunger vs moderate hunger? Physical activity vs no physical activity?
High levels of insulin from a high carb diet vs moderate levels of
insulin from a restricted carb diet?

Is a calorie of fat metabolized the exact same way as a calorie of
carbohydrate and/or a calorie of protein? The textbooks say and
emphatic &quot;NO&quot;. These are three different substances and the body deals
with each in different ways metabolically.

How the hell can you then even consider a statement such as what you
just made:

"/> Plus the human body is NOT A CLOSED SYSTEM. The law of thermodynamics

The body is not a simple engine where ALL energy-in is ALL converted
to ALL energy-out. Some of the nutrition-in is used for energy, some
is used for re-building tissue, some simply goes thru and out the
rectum, some is stored as fat.

The nutrition itself affects how much is used for energy, how much is
stored and how much goes for re-building tissue. Hormonal response to
the diet can maximize fat storage where calories-in are restricted. It
can also minimize fat storage when calories-in is relatively high.

This isn't some magical mystical concept or a &quot;magic bullet&quot;. It is
real. And more importantly it has been proven to work. All you have to
do is read the studies. Try it.

You have made conclusions that the recent studies have not. There
are NO long term studies that find that the Atkins diet is a healthy
diet. There are also concerns that the results may be skewed by
reporting by the participants. Given the small weight loss achieved
and the regained weight I would conclude that both types of diets
are failures. Outside of a situation where the participants have
no choice of intake, such as a fat farm, all studies that rely on the
free will of the participants will include psychological aspects and
will not be strict physiological studies. A prison would be a good
place to do a concise study where intake, absorption, and exercise
could be monitored. (The new lab assistant gets to run the poop in
calorimeter.) Results derived from weigh-ins and &quot;No doctor I didn't
cheat&quot; forms must be questioned.

There are many studies that associate various disease and maladies
with a high fat diet. An obese person that looses 5% weight and
remains obese may only slightly decrease their chance of heart
disease and replace it with a greater chance of colon cancer or
other disease. Most of the risk that many fear may be a result
of this diet would not show up in a short term study.

The Atkins diet by no means has be vindicated of all concern. For
the most part the advocates of this diet are financially dependent
on its acceptance. The Atkins diet may have use as a way of reducing
weight in persons that lack the self control to simply reduce intake
and increase exercise, this UNDER CLINICAL SUPERVISION. I do not
completely rule out that some modification to Akins might be a long
term diet that has acceptable levels of risk for some people. I
very much doubt that it will ever be accepted as a healthy diet for
any and all persons that wish to maintain a lower BMI without actually
exercising and controlling their intake. rms

effective weight-loss methods based on that.

Meanwhile, protein intake beyond that necessary for tissue-rebuilding
needs is used for other purposes - down to energy or energy stored as fat
or heat.

I remember an older argument from the pro-Atkins crowd that protein
calories are inefficiently converted to other calorie forms such as fat.
Only thing is, the loss becomes heat and that reduces the body's need to
specifically expend calories for body temperature maintenance purposes.
And the body does economize in a weight loss situation. And the guy at an
old job who talked most loudly about carbs being more fattening than
protein did not take an ounce off his spare tire after he went on a
lower carb diet.

&gt;&gt;Hey I noticed that too. A couple of years ago Atkins was a quack with
&gt;&gt;a dangerous diet that doesn't work.

&gt;&gt;Now, it works, it isn't dangerous, and he may not be a quack after
&gt;&gt;all.

&gt;&gt;Pretty soon, the mainstream will say that this is what they were
&gt;&gt;saying all along.

&gt; It may not work, it might be dangerous, and he might have been a

Do the nutritional scientists know *anything*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; are NO long term studies that find that the Atkins diet is a healthy
&gt; diet.

"/> Who's fault is that? One hundred years of writing off low-carb without
any studies.

There are also concerns that the results may be skewed by

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; reporting by the participants. Given the small weight loss achieved
&gt; and the regained weight I would conclude that both types of diets
&gt; are failures. Outside of a situation where the participants have
&gt; no choice of intake, such as a fat farm, all studies that rely on the
&gt; free will of the participants will include psychological aspects and
&gt; will not be strict physiological studies. A prison would be a good
&gt; place to do a concise study where intake, absorption, and exercise
&gt; could be monitored. (The new lab assistant gets to run the poop in
&gt; calorimeter.) Results derived from weigh-ins and &quot;No doctor I didn't
&gt; cheat&quot; forms must be questioned.

"/> Why has no large-scale, long-term, properly controlled studies been
done? Why is the medical and research community completely
close-minded on an area of science that hasn't been properly
researched? Why do we not know this stuff?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; other disease. Most of the risk that many fear may be a result
&gt; of this diet would not show up in a short term study.

"/> Bulls**t.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Atkins diet by no means has be vindicated of all concern.

"/> Of course not. Only a handfull of studies have been done to
specifically look at low-carb vs high-carb. Oddly enough though, all
of the few studies have shown consistent findings.

For

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the most part the advocates of this diet are financially dependent
&gt; on its acceptance.

"/> Yeah? So was Drs. Kellogg and Graham.

The Atkins diet may have use as a way of reducing

deprivation. By ensuring that the enough food is eaten in a properly
balanced way as to cause satiation. restricting carbs also minimizes
the insulin spikes that triggers the body to convert all available
nutrients (carbs) to fat.

The low-carb diet is significantly easier to adhere to than LCBs under
clinical supervision or not. But it doesn't surprise me that many or
possibly most americans who are used to huge amounts of carbs in their
diets would need some hand-holding to get out of the atrocious eating
habits they have developed over a lifetime.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; any and all persons that wish to maintain a lower BMI without actually
&gt; exercising and controlling their intake. rms

"/> Well, of course not. You've blindly accepted what the NIH, the AMA and
other such organizations have propounded for a hundred years. How
could you not accept their word? They have thousands of studies to
back their positions on diet and nutrition, right? Oh, hang on, they
haven't studied low-carb, have they? But they must know something
about it right? A hunch, and inkling, an opinion or two, right? No
studies to speak of, but the have big diplomas on their walls, right?

Oh, yeah, and the food pyramid. They have the food pyramid. They must
know something. Americans have never been fatter. They must know their
stuff in spite of the complete failure of their recomendations.

95%+ of those who try to lose weight on a low-calorie diet fails. Yet,
the theory is right, right? It their own fault that they can't starve
themselves thin, right?

Face it, the nutritionists and doctors are completely at a loss as to
what actually constitutes a proper diet.

If Adkins did anything, he finally got researchers to actually do some
real research for a frikkin' change. For that he should get a Nobel
prize.

&gt; Untrue. They teach a great deal of nutrition, but since they don't
&gt; teach cooking, doctors prescribe a lot of bad tasting, Betty Crocker

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; when they say that people on Atkins-like diets consumed as many

I've done the math with myself, my better half and several other

It is actually possible to consume more calories on a low-carb diet
and lose weight while one previously ate less calories on a low-fat
diet and failed to lose weight.

That cheating bullshit is just that, bullshit.

Decreases in blood cholesterol and fats result when you cut back on
sugars and other refined carbs. This is scientifically proven.

Also my shrink says that people

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet and exercise are an amazing combination. Of course, if you sit on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the couch eating potato chips after losing 15 lbs from the diet you will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regain the weight. If you switch to a healthy, balanced diet and get 30
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes of exercise in each day, you will keep the weight off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is, what exactly is a &quot;healthy, balanced diet&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A healthy balanced diet supplies all the needed nutrients with a minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of fat and carbs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to these and a couple of other studies, it appears that a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;low-carb, high-fat, high-protein diet is closer to a balanced diet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than a low-fat, high-carb diet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neither are &quot;balanced&quot;. A varied, wholefood diet with something from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the food groups is the only balanced diet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A balance diet is not necessarily a diet that contains all the foods
&gt;&gt;&gt;available to us. Just because we have a huge variety of foods in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;given diet does not automatically make it balanced.

&gt;&gt; It does when you remember I said &quot;wholefoods&quot;.
&gt;&gt; A little of every wholefood you can get hold of.

&gt;No it doesn't. If you are getting the optimum amount of carbs. Adding
&gt;more carbs will make it less balanced (ie. too many carbs).

"/> I don't follow. Eating what I said gives you an optimum amount of
every nutrient. Where are these extra carbs coming from?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;A balanced diet is a diet that contains the right amounts of the foods
&gt;&gt;&gt;(read macro-nutrients) the body *needs*.

&gt;&gt; Energy (eucaloric), amino acids (50 g) micronutrients (minute amount
&gt;&gt; of many molecules found easily in a varied wholefood diet), fibre
&gt;&gt; (plenty in varied wholefood diet), and water (ad libitum).

&gt;&gt;&gt;If the body does not need grains, it doesn't.

&gt;&gt; But rather silly to avoid in a varied wholefood diet.
&gt;&gt; They contain many excellent nutrients.

&gt;I said &quot;if&quot;. I could have said &quot;If the body does not need cocoa
&gt;butter&quot;. I was using it as an example.

"/> But I was asking why you would consider the body didn't need grains.
They are an excellent source of carb, protein fat, fibre and many
micronutrients. Your comment is akin to saying &quot;If the body doesn't
need vegetable foods, it doesn't&quot; True, but makes life very awkward
for yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Including grains in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;diet, whole or not, may add variety, but it doesn't necessarily help
&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;balance&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Well I disagree. There is plenty of fibre, micronutrients, energy and
&gt;&gt; amino acids. Why on earth avoid this excellent food source?

&gt;&gt;&gt;A balanced diet will contain the right amount of protein for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;bodies needs.

&gt;&gt; More accurately amino acids, but yes it gets these from proteins.
&gt;&gt; About 50 g AAs is the amount needed. (Including essential AAs)

&gt;&gt;&gt;It will also contain the right amount of fat and carbs
&gt;&gt;&gt;for optimum nutrition.

&gt;&gt; Please expand? Are you talking energy here?

&gt;No. Tissue-rebuilding, body-function needs and energy.

"/> Energy is needed for tissue building and many body functions. Fats and
carbs only contribute energy towards tissue rebuilding/replacement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, by definition, it is not &quot;low&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;High&quot; in any one area.

&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. To get what I listed above, a varied wholefood
&gt;&gt; diet is the easiest way. I'm sure you could do it in other ways.

&gt;No. A random varied wholefood diet could be completely un-balanced.

"/> Go to your local supermarket and make a list. I tried it, and you
can't go wrong. What unbalanced diet did you have in mind?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If
&gt;you are not getting the right (optimum) amount of either fats, protein
&gt;or carbs, it doesn't matter how varied or how wholefood your nutrition
&gt;is. It is still un-balanced.

"/> But you won't be deficient in anything if you eat a varied, wholefood
diet. I'd be interested to know what you have in mind here as
unbalanced. Perhaps a thought exercise?
Start at the fruit/veg section and grab a bit of each that is cheap.
Then chooses some meat and poultry and fish, some eggs, maybe some
wholegrain bread, rolled oats, and then maybe some canned beans and
other veges, some nuts...

&gt;&gt;&gt;It just may be low-carb in relation to the generally accepted

&gt;&gt; 30% for the sedentary extreme.

"/> Saying what? Heavy laborers should eat more than sedentary types to be
eucaloric?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Or high in proteins and/or fat.

&gt;&gt; The fat in a varied wholefood diet is perfectly adequate (no packaged
&gt;&gt; fat). Protein needs are best limited to the bodies requirements for

&gt;I don't think that we can fuck around and restrict fats too much.

"/> Very diffficult to do this, Terry, considering that something regarded
as carby as rolled oats has around 20% of its calories as fat. Eggs,

&gt;&gt; Trouble is, many folks take a restriction of one foodstuff as the

&gt;&gt;&gt;As an aside, it should also provide adequate vitamins and minerals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and if not, we should be aware of it and supplement as necessary.

&gt;&gt; Of course, the varied, wholefood diet has no deficiencies in this

&gt;You have made conclusions that the recent studies have not. There

&gt;and the regained weight I would conclude that both types of diets
&gt;are failures. Outside of a situation where the participants have
&gt;no choice of intake, such as a fat farm, all studies that rely on the
&gt;free will of the participants will include psychological aspects and
&gt;will not be strict physiological studies. A prison would be a good

&gt;could be monitored. (The new lab assistant gets to run the poop in
&gt;calorimeter.) Results derived from weigh-ins and &quot;No doctor I didn't
&gt;cheat&quot; forms must be questioned.

&gt;There are many studies that associate various disease and maladies
&gt;with a high fat diet. An obese person that looses 5% weight and
&gt;remains obese may only slightly decrease their chance of heart
&gt;disease and replace it with a greater chance of colon cancer or
&gt;other disease. Most of the risk that many fear may be a result
&gt;of this diet would not show up in a short term study.

&gt;The Atkins diet by no means has be vindicated of all concern. For
&gt;the most part the advocates of this diet are financially dependent
&gt;on its acceptance. The Atkins diet may have use as a way of reducing
&gt;weight in persons that lack the self control to simply reduce intake
&gt;and increase exercise, this UNDER CLINICAL SUPERVISION. I do not
&gt;completely rule out that some modification to Akins might be a long
&gt;term diet that has acceptable levels of risk for some people. I
&gt;very much doubt that it will ever be accepted as a healthy diet for
&gt;any and all persons that wish to maintain a lower BMI without actually
&gt;exercising and controlling their intake. rms

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please expand? Are you talking energy here?

&gt;&gt;No. Tissue-rebuilding, body-function needs and energy.

&gt; Energy is needed for tissue building and many body functions. Fats and
&gt; carbs only contribute energy towards tissue rebuilding/replacement.

"/> We need proteins for re-building muscles, fats for the nervous system,
etc. Not just for the energy to do the re-building.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, by definition, it is not &quot;low&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;High&quot; in any one area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. To get what I listed above, a varied wholefood
&gt;&gt;&gt; diet is the easiest way. I'm sure you could do it in other ways.

&gt;&gt;No. A random varied wholefood diet could be completely un-balanced.

&gt; Go to your local supermarket and make a list. I tried it, and you
&gt; can't go wrong. What unbalanced diet did you have in mind?

"/> The optimum amount of fats, protein and carbs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If
&gt;&gt;you are not getting the right (optimum) amount of either fats, protein
&gt;&gt;or carbs, it doesn't matter how varied or how wholefood your nutrition
&gt;&gt;is. It is still un-balanced.

&gt; But you won't be deficient in anything if you eat a varied, wholefood
&gt; diet. I'd be interested to know what you have in mind here as
&gt; unbalanced. Perhaps a thought exercise?
&gt; Start at the fruit/veg section and grab a bit of each that is cheap.
&gt; Then chooses some meat and poultry and fish, some eggs, maybe some
&gt; wholegrain bread, rolled oats, and then maybe some canned beans and
&gt; other veges, some nuts...

"/> You can't just throw together a random assortment of foods, whole or
otherwise, and expect to always get the optimum amounts of fats,
proteins and carbs.

You have to determine what the optimum amounts are and then ensure
that your meals reflect the amounts that you are aiming for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It just may be low-carb in relation to the generally accepted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recomendations.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's only low carb if you don't eat enough carb for your daily energy
&gt;&gt;&gt; expenditure. Sixty percent (of calories) for heavy labourers down to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 30% for the sedentary extreme.

&gt;&gt;Exactly. That is what I've been saying all along.

&gt; Saying what? Heavy laborers should eat more than sedentary types to be
&gt; eucaloric?

"/> Only elite athletes and heavy labourers need 60% carbs. Sedentary
people can only handle around 30% carbs. And yes, the physically
active should eat more food overall.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or high in proteins and/or fat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The fat in a varied wholefood diet is perfectly adequate (no packaged
&gt;&gt;&gt; fat). Protein needs are best limited to the bodies requirements for
&gt;&gt;&gt; several reasons (cost, and kidneys being amongst them)

&gt;&gt;I don't think that we can fuck around and restrict fats too much.

&gt; Very diffficult to do this, Terry, considering that something regarded
&gt; as carby as rolled oats has around 20% of its calories as fat. Eggs,
&gt; meat, nuts, all have plenty of fat. I would go so far as to restrict
&gt; the fat from meat and dairy so that more calorie diffuse foods can be
&gt; consumed to fill your calorie allotment

"/> I would, and do, only concern myself with ensuring that a good portion
of my fat intake is non-saturated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It
&gt;&gt;actually attenuates the insulin spike when we eat too much refined

&gt; Sorry? Is this correct? I don't believe refined anything comes into a
&gt; wholefood diet. (There are some exceptions, but striving toward
&gt; wholefoods is the aim)

"/> I agree with this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Our system needs fat for many body functions.

&gt; No it doesn't sorry. A tiny amount of linoleic asid, and thats it. Fat
&gt; is burnt (energy) or stored.

"/> I am not talking about the minimum required essential fatty acids. I
am talking about the fat needed for optimum health. What amounts of
fats are ideal for proper function of the brain, gastric functions,
the health of the skin and hair, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Also our nervous
&gt;&gt;system and the brain, needs adequate fat for proper function.

&gt; All of which can be made perfectly adequately by a well-nourished
&gt; body. The brain needs lots of the simplest most refined carb --
&gt; glucose. Drop this below 4 mEq/liter in the blood stream and you will
&gt; know all about it.

"/> Is it possible that we are over-nourishing our bodies with an excess
of carbohydrates? An emphatic yes.

Coca-Cola, cereals, Sunny Dee, pastas, potato chips, french fries,
super-sized meals, bread, bagels, donuts, candy, sugar-frosted
choco-bombs breakfast cereals, popcorn, etc., etc.,
etc..................................

Is there any chance at all that americans are under nourished when it
comes to carbs? Not bloody likely.

Americans have never, ever consumed more carbs, and they have never
ever been fatter, or sufferred more from diabetes and other obesity
related diseases.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, only in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relation to the recomendations of the food pyramid. It is all

&gt;&gt;&gt; The food pyramid states it pretty well from what I've seen of it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Trouble is, many folks take a restriction of one foodstuff as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; green light to overdo others. Human nature, I'm afraid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As an aside, it should also provide adequate vitamins and minerals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and if not, we should be aware of it and supplement as necessary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, the varied, wholefood diet has no deficiencies in this
&gt;&gt;&gt; regard.

&gt;&gt;Well, it is better in this respect than highly refined grains.

&gt; Far better than ALL refined foods.

&gt;&gt; There is the crux of the matter. &quot;Balanced diet&quot;.

&gt;&gt; For over a hundred years we have been told that a balanced diet
&gt;&gt; involves restricting fats and eating more carbs.

&gt; Untrue. The &quot;saturated fat/heart disease&quot; theory has only been
&gt; around since the 1950's. Prior to that, heart disease was generally
&gt; thought to be caused by an infection. Now, with the discovery of the
&gt; strong link between C-Reactive Proteins (a sign of infection) and
&gt; heart disease and what appears to be the impending demise of the
&gt; saturated fat/cholesterol link, it appears that the old theory may
&gt; be right after all.

"/> I wasn't talking about the sat/fat = heart disease theory.

When William Banting suggested a low-carb diet in the late 1800's the
main argument against it revolved around the dietary fat = body fat
theory.

Regarding heart disease, some studies point to high levels of blood
Homocysteine levels as a reliable precursor or indicator of heart
disease. Blood Homocysteine levels increase in the absence of several
vitamins, most notably the B vitamins and folic acid. Low levels of
these particular and other vitamins have been seen in people with
diets high in processed and refined foods (notably refined carbs), and
low in fresh produce and less-processed foods. Also note that this
diet sounds an awful lot like the typical western diet, high in
refined carbs and processed foods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A balance diet is not necessarily a diet that contains all the foods
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;available to us. Just because we have a huge variety of foods in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;given diet does not automatically make it balanced.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It does when you remember I said &quot;wholefoods&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A little of every wholefood you can get hold of.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No it doesn't. If you are getting the optimum amount of carbs. Adding
&gt;&gt;&gt;more carbs will make it less balanced (ie. too many carbs).

&gt;&gt; I don't follow. Eating what I said gives you an optimum amount of
&gt;&gt; every nutrient. Where are these extra carbs coming from?

&gt;How do you know:
&gt;1) What are the actual optimum amount of a) fats, b)carbs and c)
&gt;protein

"/> Around 0.8 g complete protein per kg body weight. A bit more won't
hurt. Sufficient carb for your daily energy requirements over and
above the calories supplied by the fats in the wholefoods, and any
excess protein to the requirements. The fat/carb ratio is not all that
fussy, so long as you try to reduce fatty wholefoods where possible.
(Skim dairy and trimmed meat eg)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and
&gt;2) That picking up a random amount a variety of &quot;wholefoods&quot; adds up
&gt;to
&gt;anything near what you consider optimum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;At some point you actually have to quantify what you are talking

&gt;&gt; But I was asking why you would consider the body didn't need grains.
&gt;&gt; They are an excellent source of carb, protein fat, fibre and many
&gt;&gt; micronutrients. Your comment is akin to saying &quot;If the body doesn't
&gt;&gt; need vegetable foods, it doesn't&quot; True, but makes life very awkward
&gt;&gt; for yourself.

&gt;I didn't want to get into this argument but, I believe that we eat way
&gt;more grains than are necerssary for good health. Especially the
&gt;refined kind.

"/> Probably correct in some cases, but I am advocating avoiding refined
grains, and eating a little of everything eucalorically.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Grains do not provide us any nutrition that we can't easily get
&gt;esewhere.

"/> Well this can be said of any food, so what. The advantage of including
grains, fruit, vegetables, meat dairy nuts and so on is to make sure
you get every molecule you need, and to avoid getting too much of
anything that might harm you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;We cannot easily digest most grains, so we have to refined
&gt;them, defeating the entire concept of wholefoods.

"/> No we don't. Wholegrain breads with wholemeal flours and other seeds
is fine. Rolled oats with barley flakes. Brown rice pud. It goes on
and on. Sweet corn as a vegetable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Just my opinion.

"/> Fair enough, but I find it strange to avoid grains unless you have a
medical problem like coeliac.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Including grains in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;diet, whole or not, may add variety, but it doesn't necessarily help
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;balance&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I disagree. There is plenty of fibre, micronutrients, energy and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amino acids. Why on earth avoid this excellent food source?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A balanced diet will contain the right amount of protein for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bodies needs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More accurately amino acids, but yes it gets these from proteins.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; About 50 g AAs is the amount needed. (Including essential AAs)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It will also contain the right amount of fat and carbs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for optimum nutrition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please expand? Are you talking energy here?

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. Tissue-rebuilding, body-function needs and energy.

&gt;&gt; Energy is needed for tissue building and many body functions. Fats and
&gt;&gt; carbs only contribute energy towards tissue rebuilding/replacement.
&gt;We need proteins for re-building muscles,

"/> Yes, around 50g per day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;fats for the nervous system,

"/> Nope. What were you thinking of?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;etc. Not just for the energy to do the re-building.

"/> In the vast main. The only essential FA is a tiy bit of linoleic acid.
Omnipresent in wholefoods, so you can just about forget about it.
Varied whole foods can easily give you too much fat if you are not
careful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You are suggesting that all nutrition is broken down to a pure energy
&gt;state.

"/> No. Proteins laid down are effectively storing 4 calories per gram.
Fat is storing 9 calories per gram of fat.
Otherwise, that not excreted is used for various energy uses that end
up as heat anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, by definition, it is not &quot;low&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;High&quot; in any one area.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. To get what I listed above, a varied wholefood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diet is the easiest way. I'm sure you could do it in other ways.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. A random varied wholefood diet could be completely un-balanced.

&gt;&gt; Go to your local supermarket and make a list. I tried it, and you
&gt;&gt; can't go wrong. What unbalanced diet did you have in mind?

&gt;The optimum amount of fats, protein and carbs.

"/> Yep, see above. Get your protein (no prob with this regimen) and then
eat eucalorically, and it all falls into place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;If
&gt;&gt;&gt;you are not getting the right (optimum) amount of either fats, protein
&gt;&gt;&gt;or carbs, it doesn't matter how varied or how wholefood your nutrition
&gt;&gt;&gt;is. It is still un-balanced.

&gt;&gt; But you won't be deficient in anything if you eat a varied, wholefood
&gt;&gt; diet. I'd be interested to know what you have in mind here as
&gt;&gt; unbalanced. Perhaps a thought exercise?
&gt;&gt; Start at the fruit/veg section and grab a bit of each that is cheap.
&gt;&gt; Then chooses some meat and poultry and fish, some eggs, maybe some
&gt;&gt; wholegrain bread, rolled oats, and then maybe some canned beans and
&gt;&gt; other veges, some nuts...

&gt;You can't just throw together a random assortment of foods, whole or
&gt;otherwise, and expect to always get the optimum amounts of fats,
&gt;proteins and carbs.

"/> Why not? Give me an example of not doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You have to determine what the optimum amounts are and then ensure
&gt;that your meals reflect the amounts that you are aiming for.

"/> See above. It ain't brain surgery :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It just may be low-carb in relation to the generally accepted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recomendations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's only low carb if you don't eat enough carb for your daily energy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expenditure. Sixty percent (of calories) for heavy labourers down to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 30% for the sedentary extreme.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly. That is what I've been saying all along.

&gt;&gt; Saying what? Heavy laborers should eat more than sedentary types to be
&gt;&gt; eucaloric?

&gt;Only elite athletes and heavy labourers need 60% carbs.

"/> That's what I said.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Sedentary
&gt;people can only handle around 30% carbs.

"/> Coz if they ate 60% of their calories as carb, they would be severely
protein deficient on a eucaloric diet. Simple arithmetic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And yes, the physically
&gt;active should eat more food overall.

"/> Ayup. That's that damned eucaloricity :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or high in proteins and/or fat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fat in a varied wholefood diet is perfectly adequate (no packaged
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fat). Protein needs are best limited to the bodies requirements for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; several reasons (cost, and kidneys being amongst them)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think that we can fuck around and restrict fats too much.

&gt;&gt; Very diffficult to do this, Terry, considering that something regarded
&gt;&gt; as carby as rolled oats has around 20% of its calories as fat. Eggs,
&gt;&gt; meat, nuts, all have plenty of fat. I would go so far as to restrict
&gt;&gt; the fat from meat and dairy so that more calorie-diffuse foods can be
&gt;&gt; consumed to fill your calorie allotment
&gt;I would, and do, only concern myself with ensuring that a good portion
&gt;of my fat intake is non-saturated.

"/> I don't worry except I drink a small amount od skim mil (in tea and on
my rolled oats) and select fat trimmed meats.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;It
&gt;&gt;&gt;actually attenuates the insulin spike when we eat too much refined
&gt;&gt;&gt;carbs.

&gt;&gt; Sorry? Is this correct? I don't believe refined anything comes into a
&gt;&gt; wholefood diet. (There are some exceptions, but striving toward
&gt;&gt; wholefoods is the aim)
&gt;I agree with this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Our system needs fat for many body functions.

&gt;&gt; No it doesn't sorry. A tiny amount of linoleic acid, and that's it. Fat
&gt;&gt; is burnt (energy) or stored.
&gt;I am not talking about the minimum required essential fatty acids. I
&gt;am talking about the fat needed for optimum health.

"/> And you will get all you could ever dream of needing in a varied,
wholefood diet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What amounts of
&gt;fats are ideal for proper function of the brain, gastric functions,
&gt;the health of the skin and hair, etc.

"/> None, actually. We can make our own perfectly well, except for a few
milligrams of linoleic acid every so often.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also our nervous
&gt;&gt;&gt;system and the brain, needs adequate fat for proper function.

&gt;&gt; All of which can be made perfectly adequately by a well-nourished
&gt;&gt; body. The brain needs lots of the simplest most refined carb --
&gt;&gt; glucose. Drop this below 4 mEq/liter in the blood stream and you will
&gt;&gt; know all about it.
&gt;Is it possible that we are over-nourishing our bodies with an excess

&gt;I`ve been following this thread closely as I`ve benefitted greatly by going low carb.
&gt;I`ve practically gone insane looking for all of my lipid test sheets that documented
&gt;how my going low carb brought me back to a normal, healthy condition. (tested every 3
&gt;months for 1.5 years, then every 6 months for 2 years) But they`re hopelessly lost in a
&gt;sea of boxes from a move a couple of years ago. So all I can do is just state for the
&gt;record that upon being diagnosed a type II diabetic (my cholesterol was over
&gt;1000....yes, 1000) I was given the basic 1500 calorie food pyramid by my Dr. and little
&gt;changed. My blood sugar levels hovered between 175-250 on average and it wasn`t until I
&gt;discovered the diabetes news groups, then the low-carb news groups did everything fall
&gt;into place. I dumped the food pyramid and followed the Atkins diet (with a fair amount
&gt;of exercise of course) then gradually introduced some carbs back into my diet and
&gt;things have been great since.
&gt;It`s been over a year since I last had a lipid panel done but my last one had my
&gt;cholesterol/triglycerides in the normal range and my BG now averages 100.
&gt;Anyway, here`s a good article about the rebuilding of the food pyramid.

helps. Strict control of carbohydrate will be essential at your stage
to control BGs without drugs. Good luck.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone honestly believe that fat consumption has gone down?
&gt;&gt;&gt; With all the talk of fast food nation, and the pre-packaged meals that
&gt;&gt;&gt; are high in fat and sugar and sodium that most people in America are
&gt;&gt;&gt; eating, you really think fat consumption has gone down? Based on the

&gt;&gt;Super-sized meals have huge jugs of soda and huge amounts of french

&gt; A 500 ml coke will have about 50 g sugar, or about 200 calories.

&gt; The fries are loaded with fat.

&gt;&gt;Pasta is touted as a perfect low fat meal (with the right sauce of
&gt;&gt;course)

&gt; By whom? Pasta usually comes with fatty sauces IME. Spag Bol eg.

&gt;&gt;Rice cakes were the rage not too long ago for low-fat dieters.

&gt; Again, by whom? I've never heard of a rice cake. What are the numbers?
&gt; Calories, carb and anything else.

&gt;&gt;Have a good look at all the low-fat snacks available in the carb aisle
&gt;&gt;in the grocery stores.

&gt; In ours, about 10% of the total available. Some &quot;lite&quot; snacks are
&gt; light in colour, salt, flavour, sugar and occasionally fat.

&gt;&gt;Never in history have americans eaten more sugar.

&gt; True, but the fat has increased too, although somewhat less than carb.

&gt; NB, the calories have risen more than anything else. And they do less.
