Vote buying has become fact of life

Thai Rath editorial _ Vote buying is so deep-rooted in Thai society
that it will take a cultural revolution to eliminate it.

A lot of people must have been shocked by a recent survey conducted by
Assumption University in which about two-thirds of respondents said
they would sell their votes in exchange for cash or benefits, and most
would not report poll fraud to election officials.

Of 3,700 respondents in 14 provinces surveyed between Oct 15-20,
almost 65% said they would accept cash or other benefits offered in
exchange for their votes in the forthcoming general election. Only
about one-third of the respondents said they would reject such offers.

The greater majority, or 83%, said they would not tell election
officials about vote buying if they were aware of it. About 66%
believed vote buying would be rampant in the Dec 23 general election.

decline. The Surayud government has launched a national campaign
against vote buying, but many critics are not enthusiastic about it.

The fact is that money politics has taken root in our country. In
addition to vote buying, popular politicians may also be &quot;bought&quot; by
big parties which offer them large sums of money to join them. Even
small parties may also be bought through merger deals.

Admittedly, various actions taken to reform the political system have
failed. A good constitution is not a cure-all solution. A cultural
revolution must be initiated to make people more protective of their
rights and freedom and see the evil of vote buying.

This is deeply disturbing news. Really, if most Thais think vote
buying is acceptable, then all these people do not deserve the right
to vote. They are simply not ready for democracy, which means that
candidates in an election for governmental posts are chosen on the
basis of who will be the best to serve the people they are suposed to
govern. Under these circumstances government by a benevolent dictator
would be better for the country. When the criterion becvomes who pays
the most for votes then the right to vote is a charade, and the people
become a plaything of those who can afford to pay the most at election
time, while taking it all back with 1000's percent of interest through
corruption when they get into power. Wehave seen it during the last
gew years when TRT was in power. Corruption begets more corruption.

look at my
what do you think?

look at th through the bouts of military interventions/subversions/royal implied
accents
for the past 100? years th is better in the hands of the dictators like toxin et
al than the military juntas-- look at the thai pharmaceutical organisation. Who
ran and runs it? It is once called the thai armed forced pharmaceutical
organisation-- got the hint?

here, k gb, you miss the crux of the people's need.
to them politics decides whether they are going to have the next bowl of rice.
yes, there have/had been revolts/reformations/speakers throats but when the guns
were/are firing, initially some foolhardy amoks raised their dead comrades aloft
the statue of freedom. When more of their brothers dropped dead, self
preservation is the name of the game. vide the revolts during titikachon,
indonesian &quot;hidup rakyat&quot;, malayan &quot;may 13&quot; and now mymar's saffron revolts.
These will die off as in the tieanmen massacre. In asia, power speaks from the
barrel of the gun-- ironically a legacy left by the colonials and horned further
today with human rights/democracy/humanism/bullshits all thrown into the
dialectics. Most of asia is in the throes of the bolshevik revolutions/french
revolutions/nazism--- Time is the essence, not rhetoric, revolts, .... which is
made harder nowadays with the west causing more confusions/false sense of
security/help. Did the greatest democracy usa help in all these &quot;fights for
democracy&quot;?

yes, at least a good part of the hardcore poors benefited--- never mind the
morality of the robbing peter to pay paul fiasco--- in this case, do you expect
squareface toxin to dig into his own pockets? The central point is, the poorest
poors benefited.
Can we hope the next government in december, better squareface to help the
poorest poors/violent thai south/democratic capitalism?
