I was just wondering if mixing yellow and blue really makes green.

For instance, if you mix yellow and blue paint and did a spectral
analysis, would there be two spikes at yellow and blue or one at
green?

Depends what you mean by "makes".

Spectral analysis will show spikes at yellow and blue.  Your eye will
see green.

Mixing the computer monitor phosphors of red, blue and green goes
toward white (additive).
Mixing paints of different colours goes toward black (subtractive).

If you shine red light on a green surface (say a laser pointer), what
colour do you see?

Do it and find out, because no matter what anyone tells you, that's
the only way you'll be sure.
Remember Michelson and Morley, they did not succeed in measuring
the velocity of light through the aether as Michelson set out to do.

Everyone knew what would happen, except it didn't.

You could try it and see! I would recommend doing a spectral analysis
of the blue paint and the yellow paint first, though, the results
might surprise you. Be careful to use a decent broad-spread light
source when doing reflectivity experiments; I have a towel that
appears green under fluorescent light, but brown in daylight. It's a
huge subject, and one that you will find fascinating.

Yellow mixed with Blue gives Light and Cool Star!

There are basically 2 kinds of color mixing:
With light sources:

With pigments:
