For those unaware of what the High Line in NYC looks like, there is an
article (mostly current photos) on nyc-architecture.com.  Apparently
this line was once considered the lifeline of NYC, bringing in most of
the food and merchandise.  According to an old NYCentral ad extolling
the High Line which is reproduced in the article, 39% of US import trade
is handled within 20 miles.  The line also shows a NYCentral diesel
engine - a Fairbanks Morse cab unit.  I must admit I have never actually
seen the line myself, even though it is within a couple blocks of two of
my favorite places in NYC (the Chocolate Bar and Bruxelles restaurant).

And I should also mention that oldnyc.com has many photos from street
level, and lists many of the buildings and companies served by the High
Line.  Apparently the last freight delivery was three carloads of frozen
turkeys.

Thanks you for the post.  Obviously it is necessary to reestablish freight
service to NYC if the goal of reducing traffic is to be met.  However, right
now the fashion is to blame private cars and ignore the freight issue.
Today such service would serve not to export goods, but to distribute
essentials including food.

Yes, and this is the kind of thing which needs to be reestablished.

That is for sure.  And the idea that NYC does not need freight service to
lower congestion is silly.  So is the idea that NYC must have subways.  The
transit officials are worried if they raise fares raidership will fall. Why?
Because people shift to the so-called dollar cabs and surface transportation

fare would not matter.  But it does.

George!

Please explain to the world how having tens of thousands of &quot;so-called
dollar cabs&quot; to handle the hundreds of thousands of rush hour transit
users is going to reduce congestion?????? Not to mention the fact that
these are illegal....

You really do live in some sort of dream world, don't you?

The subways are what made &quot;New York City&quot; possible, and still perform
the vital function they were designed for; to bring working people from
the three boroughs into Manhattan, especially the main business
districts of Wall Street, and Mid-Town. NEVER in the history of New
York, city or otherwise has freight train service figured in any large
scale way. The only exception to this was the High-Line/11th Avenue ROW,
and even then we are talking about a totally different era in time.

You keep blabbering on about &quot;returning&quot; freight trains to Manhattan, ok
just WHERE are you going to run those trains, and WHAT RR is going to
run them? The High-Line sat dormant for almost over 20 years, if CSX
could have found away to make money off the thing, even sending one
train a day down, it would have.

When trains ran down the Far West Side/Chelsea, the area was mostly
industrial, and low end housing. NYC still had very active piers and
there were scores of factories, warehouses, and the like from Canal
Street to 42nd Street. But guess what? They are all for the most part
GONE, and not coming BACK. Factories, warehouses and such all but a few
have been converted into high end housing. The piers have become a park,
and now so has the High-Line.

So what is YOUR solution? Chuck people out of their homes, reactivated a
train line that not one single RR in the world has expressed the most
vague interest in using, and then what? You still do not have any sort
of large scale market/distribution points. Fulton Fish and other markets
have all been kicked up to Hunts Point, and the owners of property in
the area are NOT interested in owning/building warehouses. Add to this
the residents of the former warehouses/factories that the High-Line
passed through/over/by would have PLENTY to say about trains running
through/past their buildings. The lawsuits alone would keep scores of
New York City lawyers in billable hours for generations.

Freight that comes into Manhattan is NOT interested in trekking all the
way over to the Far West Side, picking up whatever, then battling
traffic to get where they have to go. The only &quot;freight&quot; over there is
really the UPS depot, and IIRC they may be moving or have moved up to
the Bronx.

Do you have any idea what taxes are on commercial buildings in NYC,
especially Manhattan? Why would any shipper wish to pay the costs of
using NYC, when they can load in NJ and have items trucked straight to
their destination for much cheaper. Your way adds all sorts of costs
including time and petrol.

In short your idea is just plain WRONG and never going to happen. Stick
a fork in it, it is DONE.

I don't have to explain anything, just to point out that the authorities

&quot;The City&quot; has nothing to do with setting bus and subway fares, that
comes from the MTA. Well, NYC used to provide some funds, but that has
been cut back to nearly nothing over the years, same goes for NYS. Sixty
percent of New York City Transit's funds come from fare box recovery.

As fare as raising fares worrying the MTA/NYC it is not that it will
drive persons into &quot;dollar cabs&quot; or any other sort of cab, but that they
will drive their own cars into Manhattan. There is also the fact when
you raise fares you also raise the cost of workers, which means
businesses must pay employees more to off set the cost of daily
commuting. As these costs rise, businesses begin to look elsewhere for a
cheaper labour force, or at least a place where they can save some money
in terms of real estate, and other costs, like NJ or Conn.

George, I respect your postings here, but this will never happen.

The primary reason it can never happen is because the entire &quot;freight
infrastructure&quot; has been obliterated, and the land where the necessary freight
yards once stood (you can't have freight service withOUT freight yards in
which to sort out the traffic) is now occupied by buildings which are not
going to be torn down to rebuild such freight infrastructure.

The &quot;west side&quot; freight service of the New York Central system was supported
by two yards, one around 72nd street on the Hudson, and the other further down
in the 30's. I can still remember when the tracks were there, the loading
docks for the old NYC car floats - you could see these when Amtrak first
opened up The Empire Connection to Penn Station in 1991 (the Empire Connection
is in fact the old NYC West Side freight line, reconstructed).

I believe Donald Trump bought the 72nd street property and is building a
number of residential towers on it. Thus, that land is &quot;removed from railroad
use&quot; forever - as has been the _other_ once-busy freight railroad properties
in Manhattan.

When I first started working as an engineman at Oak Point yard in the South
Bronx, there was only one remaining &quot;local&quot; that still serviced the West Side
- &quot;OP-5&quot;, based out of Oak Point, mostly delivering carloads of newsprint, and
it was soon gone. I never had the opportunity to actually work the West Side
in freight, only have been down there on the passenger trains (and not for
quite a while now).

The other &quot;freight yards of New York&quot; are disappearing, as well.

As late as the mid-80's, Conrail was assembling RoadRailer trains for service
between New York and Buffalo at the old &quot;Highbridge Yard&quot; along the Harlem
River just north of Yankee Stadium. That is gone, replaced by a Metro-North
passenger storage and servicing yard. There will never be freight in
Highbridge again.

The Harlem River yard of the New Haven Railroad is disappearing under
construction. Where tracks once were is now occupied by The New York Post
printing plant, one of the &quot;emergency power stations&quot; of Con Edison, and there
is new construction going up immediately east of the Triborough Bridge. The
only freight customers in Harlem River are the Post (which gets carloads of
newsprint), and garbage (loaded at the north end of the yard). Actually, there
are almost no tracks _left_ in Harlem River, other than the Oak Point Link
connecting to the Hudson Line (at CP 8) and the tracks servicing the customers above.

Oak Point is the last freight yard in New York (outside of whatever facilities
the New York &amp; Atlantic might have on Long Island Rail Road territory, and
they certainly aren't substantial), and even it has &quot;shrunk&quot; to a fraction of
its former size. A portion of the yard was used for a landfill in the 80s.
Other parts are now occupied by warehouses. The only significant chunk of the
yard that remains is &quot;One Yard&quot;, parallel to the Amtrak Hell Gate main line,
and even that is not large when compared to the yards of New Jersey.

I've worked all around the NYC area since the end of the 70s, and during that
time the freight business has shriveled compared to what it was when I hired
out (and even then, the business was nothing compared to the 50s or even early
60s. There is very little left. Hold up both hands - there are probably as
many &quot;end customers&quot; in the Bronx left, as you have fingers.

The freight business, and the railroad yards that once supported such
business, are gone.
I saw it go with my own eyes, over more than a quarter of a century.
It isn't coming back.

- John

&gt;&gt; &gt;not run by the city.  If city-supplied transit were totally
&gt;essential, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;fare would not matter.  But it does.

&gt;&quot;The City&quot; has nothing to do with setting bus and subway fares, that
&gt;comes from the MTA. Well, NYC used to provide some funds, but that has
&gt;been cut back to nearly nothing over the years, same goes for NYS. Sixty
&gt;percent of New York City Transit's funds come from fare box recovery.

&gt;As fare as raising fares worrying the MTA/NYC it is not that it will
&gt;drive persons into &quot;dollar cabs&quot; or any other sort of cab, but that they
&gt;will drive their own cars into Manhattan. There is also the fact when
&gt;you raise fares you also raise the cost of workers, which means
&gt;businesses must pay employees more to off set the cost of daily
&gt;commuting. As these costs rise, businesses begin to look elsewhere for a
&gt;cheaper labour force, or at least a place where they can save some money
&gt;in terms of real estate, and other costs, like NJ or Conn.

Please don't try to confuse George with logic or facts. I found out
that he just goes off on a tangent somewhere when you try that and
then will refuse to acknowledge the original topic.
I don't remember who originally gave this sage advice: &quot;Don't try to
argue with an idiot. He'll drag you down to his level and defeat you
with experience&quot;  (it may have been Mark Twain...??) but it definitely
holds true in dealing with George. Or Jack May, for that matter..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; freight service to NYC if the goal of reducing traffic is to be
&gt; &gt; met.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However, right now the fashion is to blame private cars and ignore

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; People are gullible and susceptible to media influence.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That is for sure.  And the idea that NYC does not need freight service
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; lower congestion is silly.  So is the idea that NYC must have subways.
&gt; &gt; The

&gt; So were other cities too.  Many cities exist without such systems.  So?- Hide quoted text -

Manhattan without subways. Impossible.  And explain to me what cities

Come on George, tell me.

And you are a sociology professor????  It must be hilarious to sit in

Let's see, when I was young, the fare on the NY subway was a nickel.  Not
sure what it is now, but I am sure they have raised the fares
substantially since then.   So by your reasoning, ridership on the NY
subway system has fallen since the 1930s.  With all the fare increases
since the 1930s, I guess hardly anybody rides the subways any more.

I wonder why they are building that new subway along 2nd Ave.?

5,000,000 a day, Merritt.  1.5 billion a year.  Those numbers are too
high for Georgie Boy to understand.

But he feels that you could eliminate the subways and Manhattan would
be very able to handle the millions of private cars.

&gt;The subways are what made &quot;New York City&quot; possible, and still perform

&gt;districts of Wall Street, and Mid-Town. NEVER in the history of New
&gt;York, city or otherwise has freight train service figured in any large
&gt;scale way. The only exception to this was the High-Line/11th Avenue ROW,
&gt;and even then we are talking about a totally different era in time.

&gt;You keep blabbering on about &quot;returning&quot; freight trains to Manhattan, ok

&gt;run them? The High-Line sat dormant for almost over 20 years, if CSX
&gt;could have found away to make money off the thing, even sending one
&gt;train a day down, it would have.

&gt;When trains ran down the Far West Side/Chelsea, the area was mostly
&gt;industrial, and low end housing. NYC still had very active piers and
&gt;there were scores of factories, warehouses, and the like from Canal
&gt;Street to 42nd Street. But guess what? They are all for the most part
&gt;GONE, and not coming BACK. Factories, warehouses and such all but a few
&gt;have been converted into high end housing. The piers have become a park,
&gt;and now so has the High-Line.

However, the Hign Line could be a good rapid transit line be it light
rail, subway or extension of the Long Island Railroad.  Running some
Metro-North Hudson line trains also MIGHT POSSIBLY be worth while. The
trains could be quiet enough so that they would be an asset.  I am
skeptical that it would be worth the cost but it could be worth while.

Clark, it has been studied and it is way too far west to be
worthwhile.

Of course there is limited amounts of money available and there are
many more desparate needs like the 2nd ave subway and the 7 extension.

No matter how yuo slice it, there are far better ways to spend the
bucks.

Oh dear.   You have such problems.  The obvious solution, then, is to

&gt; George, I respect your postings here, but this will never happen.

&gt; The primary reason it can never happen is because the entire &quot;freight
&gt; infrastructure&quot; has been obliterated, and the land where the necessary
&gt; freight
&gt; yards once stood (you can't have freight service withOUT freight yards in
&gt; which to sort out the traffic) is now occupied by buildings which are not
&gt; going to be torn down to rebuild such freight infrastructure.

&gt; The &quot;west side&quot; freight service of the New York Central system was
&gt; supported
&gt; by two yards, one around 72nd street on the Hudson, and the other further
&gt; down
&gt; in the 30's. I can still remember when the tracks were there, the loading
&gt; docks for the old NYC car floats - you could see these when Amtrak first
&gt; opened up The Empire Connection to Penn Station in 1991 (the Empire
&gt; Connection
&gt; is in fact the old NYC West Side freight line, reconstructed).

&gt; I believe Donald Trump bought the 72nd street property and is building a
&gt; number of residential towers on it. Thus, that land is &quot;removed from
&gt; railroad
&gt; use&quot; forever - as has been the _other_ once-busy freight railroad
&gt; properties
&gt; in Manhattan.

&gt; When I first started working as an engineman at Oak Point yard in the
&gt; South
&gt; Bronx, there was only one remaining &quot;local&quot; that still serviced the West
&gt; Side
&gt; - &quot;OP-5&quot;, based out of Oak Point, mostly delivering carloads of newsprint,
&gt; and
&gt; it was soon gone. I never had the opportunity to actually work the West
&gt; Side
&gt; in freight, only have been down there on the passenger trains (and not for
&gt; quite a while now).

&gt; The other &quot;freight yards of New York&quot; are disappearing, as well.

&gt; As late as the mid-80's, Conrail was assembling RoadRailer trains for
&gt; service
&gt; between New York and Buffalo at the old &quot;Highbridge Yard&quot; along the Harlem
&gt; River just north of Yankee Stadium. That is gone, replaced by a
&gt; Metro-North
&gt; passenger storage and servicing yard. There will never be freight in
&gt; Highbridge again.

&gt; The Harlem River yard of the New Haven Railroad is disappearing under
&gt; construction. Where tracks once were is now occupied by The New York Post
&gt; printing plant, one of the &quot;emergency power stations&quot; of Con Edison, and
&gt; there
&gt; is new construction going up immediately east of the Triborough Bridge.
&gt; The
&gt; only freight customers in Harlem River are the Post (which gets carloads
&gt; of
&gt; newsprint), and garbage (loaded at the north end of the yard). Actually,
&gt; there
&gt; are almost no tracks _left_ in Harlem River, other than the Oak Point Link
&gt; connecting to the Hudson Line (at CP 8) and the tracks servicing the
&gt; customers above.

&gt; Oak Point is the last freight yard in New York (outside of whatever
&gt; facilities
&gt; the New York &amp; Atlantic might have on Long Island Rail Road territory, and
&gt; they certainly aren't substantial), and even it has &quot;shrunk&quot; to a fraction
&gt; of
&gt; its former size. A portion of the yard was used for a landfill in the 80s.
&gt; Other parts are now occupied by warehouses. The only significant chunk of
&gt; the
&gt; yard that remains is &quot;One Yard&quot;, parallel to the Amtrak Hell Gate main
&gt; line,
&gt; and even that is not large when compared to the yards of New Jersey.

&gt; I've worked all around the NYC area since the end of the 70s, and during
&gt; that
&gt; time the freight business has shriveled compared to what it was when I
&gt; hired
&gt; out (and even then, the business was nothing compared to the 50s or even

Thanks for the information John.  It is too bad that the city has
allowed and even encouraged the abandonment of goods coming into the city by
rail.

I used to listen to the freight trains roll by Brooklyn College and
even went over to watch.  But the 4 tracks shrank to only 1 in good shape
even by the time I left the city.  Is there any business on that line
anymore?  They used to have lines of coal trucks picking up coal from that
line and delivering coal to the businesses in Flatbush.  Is that all gone

&gt; &gt; George, I respect your postings here, but this will never happen.

&gt; &gt; The primary reason it can never happen is because the entire

yards in
&gt; &gt; which to sort out the traffic) is now occupied by buildings which
are not
&gt; &gt; going to be torn down to rebuild such freight infrastructure.

&gt; &gt; The &quot;west side&quot; freight service of the New York Central system was
&gt; &gt; supported
&gt; &gt; by two yards, one around 72nd street on the Hudson, and the other
further
&gt; &gt; down
&gt; &gt; in the 30's. I can still remember when the tracks were there, the

Yes, there is rail freight in Brooklyn, Queens (and the rest of Long

Whether you admit it or not, it is a given that somehow 100% of the costs
are paid by someone.  That is the definition of &quot;cost.&quot;  You get nothing

The New York City Board of Education was the largest buyer of anthracite
coal in the US until quite recently.  As recently as 10 years ago a
public school near me was still burning coal.  There was a bond issue a
few years ago to replace coal fired boilers with gas fired boilers.  I
don't know if the work is complete yet.

Nah.. I consider Charlotte to be at best a medium sized city, and it is the
largest in the Carolinas. The state does have an amazing number of high end
college grads as well... (Ever hear of the Research Triangle up George's way)
I work in a pool of 1000 high end geeks in a cubical farm here in Charlotte.
True, there are the opposite in large numbers as well in the countryside
further west.  (Anyone need a pig farm?  We got a bunch of them...)

I've lived in Cleveland, Chicago, and spent time in other &quot;large&quot; areas.
Frankly, I prefer the smaller towns.  I spent more than a decade in Chicago, a
year in Cleveland  (I would add one month to that, but it wasn't all THAT
bad...)   In *all* the cities I used the rail systems to get around.  I was
too young to drive in Chicago, so I used rail to get downtown for movies,
shopping and the like.  It was safe and effective back then.  I wouldn't let a
9 year old do that now, however.  I used the Cleveland Rapid to get to
downtown periodically while in college at Case.  I'd still do that if I were
there, living on Murray Hill Drive.  However, I *wouldn't* be living there at
this point.  (I value safety much more highly now... Being between the Hough
and Little Italy didn't leave you in the best area of Cleveland...)

That said, a smaller town (population wise) that is spread out over more than
200 square miles doesn't make a very transit friendly area.   High density
cities like NY, and lower density areas like Chicago and Cleveland can do
transit simply because of the concentrations of jobs and people along the
lines.  There just isn't anywhere that matches that in the Carolinas.

The bus system wastes enough money.  Rail will be the big dig forever here.
(After all, Parsons did both the Boston big dig, and the charlotte mud
dig...err.. excuse me.. South Corridor light rail..  And the city seems to
think that $60 million per year will be required to subsidize that line
alone...)

I will probably end up selling this house, and moving further south again,
this time to South Carolina.  I can't afford the $8,000 or more that they are
going to dump on each of the taxpayers in the city to build their 8 billion
(their current costs.. may go to 15 or 20 billion) light rail system.

&gt; Nah.. I consider Charlotte to be at best a medium sized city, and it is
&gt; the
&gt; largest in the Carolinas. The state does have an amazing number of high
&gt; end
&gt; college grads as well... (Ever hear of the Research Triangle up George's
&gt; way)
&gt; I work in a pool of 1000 high end geeks in a cubical farm here in
&gt; Charlotte.
&gt; True, there are the opposite in large numbers as well in the countryside
&gt; further west.  (Anyone need a pig farm?  We got a bunch of them...)

&gt; I've lived in Cleveland, Chicago, and spent time in other &quot;large&quot; areas.
&gt; Frankly, I prefer the smaller towns.  I spent more than a decade in
&gt; Chicago, a
&gt; year in Cleveland  (I would add one month to that, but it wasn't all THAT
&gt; bad...)   In *all* the cities I used the rail systems to get around.  I
&gt; was
&gt; too young to drive in Chicago, so I used rail to get downtown for movies,
&gt; shopping and the like.  It was safe and effective back then.  I wouldn't
&gt; let a
&gt; 9 year old do that now, however.  I used the Cleveland Rapid to get to
&gt; downtown periodically while in college at Case.  I'd still do that if I
&gt; were
&gt; there, living on Murray Hill Drive.  However, I *wouldn't* be living there
&gt; at
&gt; this point.  (I value safety much more highly now... Being between the
&gt; Hough
&gt; and Little Italy didn't leave you in the best area of Cleveland...)

&gt; That said, a smaller town (population wise) that is spread out over more
&gt; than
&gt; 200 square miles doesn't make a very transit friendly area.   High density
&gt; cities like NY, and lower density areas like Chicago and Cleveland can do
&gt; transit simply because of the concentrations of jobs and people along the
&gt; lines.  There just isn't anywhere that matches that in the Carolinas.

&gt; The bus system wastes enough money.  Rail will be the big dig forever
&gt; here.
&gt; (After all, Parsons did both the Boston big dig, and the charlotte mud
&gt; dig...err.. excuse me.. South Corridor light rail..  And the city seems to
&gt; think that $60 million per year will be required to subsidize that line
&gt; alone...)

&gt; I will probably end up selling this house, and moving further south again,
&gt; this time to South Carolina.  I can't afford the $8,000 or more that they
&gt; are
&gt; going to dump on each of the taxpayers in the city to build their 8
&gt; billion
&gt; (their current costs.. may go to 15 or 20 billion) light rail system.
">

But will the ballot proposition to withdraw the sales tax for transit pass?
If so, the officials are promising to fire police, firefighters and teachers
to pay for the rail system anyway.

George-

Passenger vehicles represent the vast majority of all vehicles on the
road during peak travel times, and removing freight wouldn't
measurably affect congestion. Engineers generally figure that they can

&quot;the fashion&quot; right now, it's just how things have always been. (And
even the trucks on the road during peak congestion times are mostly
making local deliveries, and are not potential candidates for rail

The flipside is that, when designing _pavement_ capacity, you can
ignore passenger cars; if a pavement is built strong enough to support
a reasonable number of truck loads, it could probably survive an
infinite number of passenger car loads without sustaining damage. So
it's not that there aren't good reasons to remove trucks from the
roads, it's just that reducing urban congestion isn't one of them.

Are you talking about New York City specifically here?  With main
interstates now running 40% heavy trucks, I don't see how you can ignore
them, unless of course you do, and then problems develop later.  (Consider
I-81 for an example).  And yes, a legally-loaded truck causes 9,000 times
more damage to a road than a passenger car, but so far that has not been an
issue raised here.

Umm, I believe this whole thing was about Manhattan getting hammered
by trucks and commercial vehicles.  Thanks for your insight, but
general road design principles have nothing to do with Manhattan
getting hammered by the above.

You have to get through traffic out of Manhattan.  And the way you do
that is make it financially so unattractive to those vehicles that
they use other options, like a toll free Verrazano.   $1000 toll for
through 18 wheelers going through Manhattan.

Then IMHO trucks and commecial traffic that use Manhattan's streets
and curb space should pay for it.
18 wheelers $1000, 8-10 wheelers $500, 4 wheel commercial vehicles
$100.

Private vehicles that enter Manhattan are part of the problem.  There
are other options like transit.  If they so choose to enter in a
private vehicle, A $50 toll is not that much.

Like the parking fines in NYC, you have to make the people that would
do this think hard about their choice.

I wasn't talking about New York City specifically. I haven't heard
that &quot;main interstates are now running 40% heavy trucks&quot;, but even if
that were true it wouldn't make them important contributors to urban
congestion. The reasons are that:

a.) Truck traffic, especially long haul trucks, are a 24-hour
operation, whereas passenger vehicles are out in force for less than
half of the day and peak in two shorter &quot;drive-time&quot; periods.

b.) The mix changes significantly in urban areas, where commuter
traffic plays a much bigger role. Sure, when I drive through central
Illinois at night there are as many trucks as cars - but when I hit
Indianapolis many more cars join the fun, and drive the percentage of
trucks way down.

For a New York specific example, see the stats for the GWB at

http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch6en/conc6en/georgewashington...

Not only does this mention that trucks represent about 8% of all
bridge traffic (23,000 trucks out of 300,000 vehicles), it also shows
that traffic is highly peaked during popular commuting hours and, to a
lesser extent, during the midday hours. The most congested periods can
therefore be assumed to have a significantly lower percent truck
traffic than the 8% daily average. Of these trucks, many are traveling
between New Jersey to New England, while others are accessing
Manhattan itself.

Why the discrepancy between trucks and cars? It can't be justified on
the basis of preventing congestion. Even if you compare a 53' trailer
with full sleeper cab to a Honda Insight or a Mini Cooper, the truck
takes up perhaps 5 times as much space as the car - why should it pay
20 times as much? For that matter, why should a 4 wheel commercial
vehicle pay more than a private passenger auto?

Trucks already use the Verrazano to avoid tolls into/through Manhattan.
Same reason they use Canal Street to the tunnels going Westbound.

Add to this trucks and commercial veichals that use Second Avenue
because to reach the East River crossings,since they are banned on the
FDR.

In short there are all sorts of routes trucks take to avoid tolls, but
also to avoid areas where they cannot go without having to spend hours
and lots of petrol going out of their way.

Now, to Manhattan residents this may seem bothersome, but there has to
be a  balance since until someone produces a better way, much of the
goods in the NYC/metro and indeed Northeast are trucked.

And you would see more of those &quot;free&quot; parking stickers in windows than
one already sees, both real and fake. Many people talk a good game about
limiting traffic into Manhattan, until it pertains to them and theirs .
Suddenly they NEED to drive into town and park right in front, if not
near where ever they are going. Why a LE officer from Albany, should be
allowed to park &quot;free&quot; in NYC is anyone's guess, but they like hundreds
of others can and do. Until NYC cracks down on issuance/use of such
cards, it is going to be very hard to convince the general public to
give up their cars.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The flipside is that, when designing _pavement_ capacity, you can
&gt;&gt; &gt; ignore passenger cars; if a pavement is built strong enough to
&gt; support
&gt;&gt; &gt; a reasonable number of truck loads, it could probably survive an
&gt;&gt; &gt; infinite number of passenger car loads without sustaining damage. So
&gt;&gt; &gt; it's not that there aren't good reasons to remove trucks from the
&gt;&gt; &gt; roads, it's just that reducing urban congestion isn't one of them.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Dan

&gt;&gt; Umm, I believe this whole thing was about Manhattan getting hammered
&gt;&gt; by trucks and commercial vehicles.  Thanks for your insight, but
&gt;&gt; general road design principles have nothing to do with Manhattan
&gt;&gt; getting hammered by the above.

&gt;&gt; You have to get through traffic out of Manhattan.  And the way you do
&gt;&gt; that is make it financially so unattractive to those vehicles that
&gt;&gt; they use other options, like a toll free Verrazano.   $1000 toll for
&gt;&gt; through 18 wheelers going through Manhattan.

&gt; Trucks already use the Verrazano to avoid tolls into/through Manhattan.
&gt; Same reason they use Canal Street to the tunnels going Westbound.

&gt; Add to this trucks and commercial veichals that use Second Avenue
&gt; because to reach the East River crossings,since they are banned on the
&gt; FDR.

&gt; In short there are all sorts of routes trucks take to avoid tolls, but
&gt; also to avoid areas where they cannot go without having to spend hours
&gt; and lots of petrol going out of their way.

&gt; Now, to Manhattan residents this may seem bothersome, but there has to
&gt; be a  balance since until someone produces a better way, much of the
&gt; goods in the NYC/metro and indeed Northeast are trucked.

&gt;&gt; Then IMHO trucks and commecial traffic that use Manhattan's streets
&gt;&gt; and curb space should pay for it.
&gt;&gt; 18 wheelers $1000, 8-10 wheelers $500, 4 wheel commercial vehicles
&gt;&gt; $100.

&gt;&gt; Private vehicles that enter Manhattan are part of the problem.  There
&gt;&gt; are other options like transit.  If they so choose to enter in a
&gt;&gt; private vehicle, A $50 toll is not that much.

&gt;&gt; Like the parking fines in NYC, you have to make the people that would
&gt;&gt; do this think hard about their choice.

&gt;&gt; Randy

&gt; And you would see more of those &quot;free&quot; parking stickers in windows than
&gt; one already sees, both real and fake. Many people talk a good game about
&gt; limiting traffic into Manhattan, until it pertains to them and theirs .
&gt; Suddenly they NEED to drive into town and park right in front, if not
&gt; near where ever they are going. Why a LE officer from Albany, should be
&gt; allowed to park &quot;free&quot; in NYC is anyone's guess, but they like hundreds
&gt; of others can and do. Until NYC cracks down on issuance/use of such
&gt; cards, it is going to be very hard to convince the general public to
&gt; give up their cars.

No, it will just charge a high fee for entering the city.

&gt; &gt; Why the discrepancy between trucks and cars? It can't be justified on
&gt; &gt; the basis of preventing congestion. Even if you compare a 53' trailer
&gt; &gt; with full sleeper cab to a Honda Insight or a Mini Cooper, the truck
&gt; &gt; takes up perhaps 5 times as much space as the car - why should it pay
&gt; &gt; 20 times as much? For that matter, why should a 4 wheel commercial
&gt; &gt; vehicle pay more than a private passenger auto?

&gt; &gt; Dan

&gt; Like the telephone company used to say, it charges what the line is worth to
&gt; you, not what it costs to provide the service.
">

In the case of a private business attempting to maximize its profit,
that makes perfect sense. In the case of a government entity
attempting to reduce congestion by changing driver behavior, it
doesn't. The charge structure in this case should be based on what
provides the most efficient congestion relief.

Oh, really George.  Where did you come up with that?????

Another crapola statement from the sociology professor that knows
nothing.

The Georgie Boy shredding machine is running at high speed, high revs
for anyone that is interested.

You know all the income levels of everone that rides the NYC subways,
NJ Transit, you know it all, huh Georgie Boy.

Higher then average incomes, huh Georgie Boy, yeah sure, Georgie Boy.

Everyone that rides the NEC on NJ Transit to their jobs in Newark or
with the state in Trenton, has higher then average incomes, huh
Georgie Boy.

I just reek with respect for you Georgie Boy, actually you reek
Georgie Boy..

Georgie Boy, you are so scared as to what is going to happen in the
new Congress coming in in 2009.  Well I will tell you Georgie Boy,
just to increase your fear.

Rail subsidies WILL increase, Amtrak subsidies WILL increase.  Are you
scared yet Georgie Boy???  Now go crying home to mumsy,  Georgie Boy,
or your bosom buddy Buffoon Kozel and you can both have a good cry.

I love this so very much, thanks for posting,  Georgie Boy.

Georgie Boy is too ignorant to be jealous.  He has no comprehension of
who uses rail.   He has no idea of anything anywhere other then his
Reason Foundation provided info and subsidies that pontificate that no
one uses rail.

He is a sociology professor that knows nothing except what he is told
by his subsidisers.

Georgie Boy reeks but it is not with intelligence, as he continues to
prove.

But I hope he continues posting his unbelieveable crapola, as it is so
enjoyable to keep the high revving super efficient Georgie Boy and
Jackie Baby shredding machine in peak operation.

We can well afford to get separate models, one for each, as they are
equally deserving of super shredding, and just think, opportunities
for TWO shredding machine operators.

I want to reserve one just for me.  I am so greedy.

&gt; I wasn't talking about New York City specifically. I haven't heard
&gt; that &quot;main interstates are now running 40% heavy trucks&quot;, but even if
&gt; that were true it wouldn't make them important contributors to urban
&gt; congestion. The reasons are that:

&gt; a.) Truck traffic, especially long haul trucks, are a 24-hour
&gt; operation, whereas passenger vehicles are out in force for less than
&gt; half of the day and peak in two shorter &quot;drive-time&quot; periods.

&gt; b.) The mix changes significantly in urban areas, where commuter
&gt; traffic plays a much bigger role. Sure, when I drive through central
&gt; Illinois at night there are as many trucks as cars - but when I hit
&gt; Indianapolis many more cars join the fun, and drive the percentage of
&gt; trucks way down.
">

Not to mention that truckers, being paid by the mile and not by the hour, do
everything they can to avoid urban congestion.  Here, you'll see virtually
no long-haul trucks on the road during peak traffic hours, but they floor
the roads during off-peak hours, particularly between 10pm and 4am.  My bet
is that the 40% claim is only for rural interstates, not areas which are
congested with commuter traffic.
