The Grand Canyon Skywalk is in the news again, with a claimed March
28th opening date:

[in part]

"The tribe expects the Skywalk to boost tourism at a more modest development
already in place: a smattering of sites 120 miles east of Las Vegas offering
experiences that can't be found at the park, including an Old West Main
Street and cowboy show, an Indian village, horseback riding, wagon rides and
Humvee tours.

In addition, the Hualapai operate airplane and helicopter tours that fly
visitors into the canyon on low-level routes, which are forbidden at the
national park. After landing beside the river, visitors can embark on guided
pontoon boat and raft rides - day tours not offered in the park. The tribe's
master plan calls for the construction of a cable car to ferry visitors from
the canyon rim to the river.

There, the tribe is also seeking to expand tourism. The Grand Canyon
National Park's Colorado River management plan, finalized in December,
allows the tribe to take 600 passengers on motorized pontoon boats each day,
far fewer than the 1,800 daily allotment the Hualapai requested.

Beattie of Grand Canyon Resort Corp. said the boating restrictions would
prevent the tribe from expanding river operations, now the tribe's most
popular tourist attraction. Although it flows through the reservation, the
river is under federal control.

Some members of the tribe are uncomfortable with the development. Joe
Powskey, a Hualapai guide who takes tourists through a newly built Indian
village adjacent to the Skywalk construction site, said that although growth
was necessary to give the tribe an economic base, tribal leaders needed to
be careful not to overdo it.

"Our priority is not to overdevelop," Powskey said. "We want to kind of keep
it pristine here."

Powskey said he was aggrieved to see visitors step down from buses and toss
cigarette butts around the rim. "We ask people not to smoke. They do. We
tell them not to throw cigarettes around; the bones of our ancestors are
buried here."

Others in the tribe have been critical of what they say is the development's
lack of sustainability, pointing out that water used here is trucked in over
miles of unpaved, rutted roads, and that there is no sewer, trash, telephone
or electrical service. The airport, which is expanding, operates on diesel
generators. The park, in contrast, has a busy complex of hotels, shops and
restaurants, most clustered on the South Rim of the Canyon, several miles
upstream from the reservation. The park does not draw water from the river,
but from an aging pipeline.

Tribal officials admit it will be difficult to operate a full-service resort
without upgrading infrastructure and finding a local source of water.
Hualapai officials said last week that they were considering taking water
from the Colorado River.

Pumping water up nearly a vertical mile from the river to the rim of the
canyon could be fraught with financial and legal challenges. Joseph Feller,
who teaches water law at Arizona State University, says no tribe has ever
taken water from the Colorado without first negotiating with the federal
government.

The tribe's YellowHawk said: "We're looking at pumping water out of the
river; that may be our best bet." She added that the tribe was attempting to
negotiate with the Department of the Interior. Attorneys with the department
solicitor's office confirmed that the tribe had made initial overtures
regarding water rights on the Colorado."

I thought the most interesting part was the idea of building a cable
car from the rim to the river. Hopefully they'll have the road to the site
paved by then. lol
