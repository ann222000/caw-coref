1. WWE Cruiserweight title: Hornswoggle def. Short Stack Simpson in
3:40 with the tadpole (frog) splash.

After the match, Smackdown assistant GM Vicki Guerrero came out and
said that Hornswoggle has to grant Jamie Noble a rematch for the title
within 30 days or face forfeiture. Fit Finlay came out and said that
Noble didn't deserve a shot. Mrs. Guerrero then turned around and made
a rematch between Finlay &amp; Noble for later.

UWA Commissioner Rick Steamboat announced that WWE US Champion Montel
V. Porter has been placed on medical suspension due to Wolfe-Parkinson-
White Syndrome, and has been removed from the #1 contender's
tournament. However, John Cena, Porter's scheduled opponent, and Ken
Kennedy, who would've gotten byes into the semis, will now face new
opponents.

2. #1 contender's tournament, quarterfinals: Samoa Joe def.
Christopher Daniels in 14:10 with the Muscle Buster. Senshi &amp; Elix
Skipper didn't come out with Daniels as they had the next match.
Daniels missed with the Angel's Wings and the Best Moonsault Ever.
After the latter misfire, Joe hit the Muscle Buster to end it.

3. Triple X (Senshi &amp; Skipper) def. Serotonin (Raven &amp; Havok) in 3:30
when Havok was pinned after the Warrior's Way. Protracted squash.

4. &quot;Showtime&quot; Eric Young def. Robert Roode in 6:45 with an inside
cradle after blocking the Payoff (Perfectplex).

Ken Kennedy is out, and cuts a promo on Steamboat, complaining that
the commish supposedly didn't keep his word. Well.......

5. #1 contender's tournament, quarterfinals: CM Punk def. Ken Kennedy
in 11:05 with Go To Sleep. Kennedy stalled at first, unhappy that he
lost the bye he was given last week, but then he took advantage when
Punk missed a crossbody off the middle rope. He got heat on Punk, but
then gave back the advantage when he missed the Kenton Bomb. The Pepsi
Plunge set up the GTS, and Punk now moves on to the semi-finals.

6. #1 contender's tournament, quarterfinals: AJ Hunter def. Brent
Albright in 9:30 via submission after double jeopardy (spinebuster-
sharpshooter). AJ faces Samoa Joe in the semis.

7. #1 contender's match for the women's title---winner faces UWA
Women's champ Nattie Neidhart next week: Beth Phoenix def. Michelle
McCool and Gail Kim in 11:10 of a triple threat single fall match,
pinning McCool after Down in Flames (modified Michinoku Driver).

WWE Champion John Cena hooks up with his cousin, &quot;Trademarc&quot;, who's
now in TNA running with Kurt Angle. Cena's not down with that, and
points out the history he's had with Angle in the past. &quot;He's a user
and an abuser, worse than anyone we ever ran across back in the day&quot;,
Cena says. &quot;I don't know how much he paid you to be his lap dog down
in Orlando, when you had it made in the shade at home.&quot;

Trademarc says that after their CD bombed 2 years ago, WWE didn't want
anything to do with him and tried to make Cena into one of their
&quot;Stepford Children&quot;. He got a call from Angle, and yeah, he got a
sweet offer on top of that, and the rest is history. There's a pause,
and then AJ appears, with a disheveled Angle. &quot;You should pay more
attention to the company you keep, 'Marc&quot;, he growls, &quot;'specially
since this geek lost his mind a long time ago and needs to be
surrounded by enablers and drones to make him happy. I thought you
were better than that.&quot;

Turns out Angle was hoping to ambush Cena and take his spot in the
tournament. AJ sniffed it out and promptly thrashed Angle yet again.

8. WWE World tag team titles: Lance Cade &amp; Trevor Murdoch def. the
Highlanders in 4:10 with Cade pinning Rory after the hi-lo.

9. #1 contender's tournament, quarterfinals: Ring of Honor champion
Takeshi Morishima upset John Cena in 11:34 with a modified backdrop
driver. Morishima now faces CM Punk in the semi-finals. Cena took the
challenge on head-on, and had Morishima beaten at one point after an
FU, but Morishima landed close enough to the ropes to force a break.

Now, kidz, take a guess who will be in the finals.
