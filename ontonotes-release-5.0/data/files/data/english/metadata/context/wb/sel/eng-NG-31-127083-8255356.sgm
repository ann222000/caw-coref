Sarah &amp; Steve!  Have a great time.  I hope you get to take some pix
and share them with us when you get back.  I am sure that having a
smober vacation will rock and definitely you'll have more time to
enjoy it as it won't be wasted smoking.

What?  The weekends at the lake aren't enough for you?  Those are
short and I miss you just for those few days.  Well, if you must then
have a great time.  Remember, don't drink and drive because you might
spill your drink.

Well, got our first American speeding ticket, guess we are collecting
those this trip!  :)  All is well, and thought I'd drop a line, as the
hotel has internet and a computer.  I am missing AS3 already.  You
guys are my new addiction and I couldn't have a better one!  Love

Although you might think so, those speed limit signs are not
&quot;suggestions&quot;.  They do have some give to them, but it's pretty much
up to the cop as to how much give he's gonna give ya.  Sarah, I'm
rather disappointed in you that you couldn't talk your way out of it.

wouldn't do :o)
Plenty of scope there &lt;BG&gt;
Try and pop in when you can, will be thinking of you.
We go off on our 'hols' on Saturday for 2 weeks, but I doubt I'll be

Many, many years ago, George Bernard Shaw was attending a cocktail party.

A fellow who considered himself something of a wag and an authority on
language accosted Shaw and said: &quot;Mr. Shaw, are you aware that there is only
*one* word in the English language that is spelled with an S-U and is
pronounced as though it were S-H? That word, sir, is 'sugar'.&quot; Then he
folded his arms and stood there smirking.

Shaw smiled politely, nodded and said : &quot;Sure.&quot;
