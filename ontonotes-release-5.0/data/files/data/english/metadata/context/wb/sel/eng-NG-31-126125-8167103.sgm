Tell me if I missed something.

Still the Dalek said his Home Planet was dead.

IT has been dead since Remembrance of the Daleks!

Also, the Kaleds started off like humans until Davros
mutated and mulitated them.

And where is Davros these days?

The Dalek-human hybrid, do they not look like jageroth?

Some thoughts.

As you said &quot;Still the Dalek said his Home Planet was dead&quot;... yes, it
still is.  Unless it's undead.  You never know.

Dalek Sec must be a grass-roots conservative, much like yourself, and
wants to return to the days of old-fashioned morals and apple pie.

I thought these were fairly sensible questions from someone who
normally just riles everyone with banality.

Commendation for attempting to promote discussion, Doctor!

My knowledge of classic Who is patchy as I have never re-watched them
since I was a nipper, but I get the feeling that there are a lot of
continuity gaffs concerning the beginnings and demises of Gallifrey
and Skaro. Perhaps the new series should have been called &quot;Who Begins&quot;
and just dispensed with history?

That said, a good Davros story would be welcomed.

Oddly enough it's a good point, Illuminatists falling on their own sword is amusing.
I imagine this parisian thing conflicts with the Aracnos a bit.

Really if they are from Manhattan what's with the clean language?
It explains the puzzling Hoover file.  Also the Hoover Vacume cleaner company.
