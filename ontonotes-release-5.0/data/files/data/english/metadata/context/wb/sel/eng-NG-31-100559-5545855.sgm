Just to follow up. I ordered some crankshaft bearings (.020") from
German Auto Parts ( www.germanparts.com ).

They seemed to be the only place showing they had these bearings in
stock, and their price was about $45 cheaper than the dealer, so I
ordered and paid for them.

After a few days I inquired as to the status of the order. After 5 days
I was finally e-mailed saying the products was back-ordered.

So, if you know your part-number and they have it in stock, they appear
to be well-priced.

If you need a reliable company that communicates well and keeps you
informed of your purchase, German Auto Parts is NOT that company. I am
very disappointed with this company and hope to pass this along to
anyone who is trying to do repairs in a timely fashion.

They don't want you to call them to inquire, everything is done by
e-mail - slowly.

FCP Groton has continued to be very good at communicating. VLV world
has been good, I haven't had any problems with an order, other than
they didn't include a packing list with my shipment - but it was all
there.

I'll be ordering from IPD soon and we'll see how that goes.

Lots of experience ordering from IPD and FCP Groton. Â They're both pretty good.
The folks at Oregon are a little friendlier on the phone/
