&quot;The Resurrection&quot; by Ogden Kraut
Chapter 11

THREE DEGREES OF GLORY

It has been said that the most enlightening revelation ever given to
mankind may be Section 76 in the Doctrine and Covenants (compilation of
&quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot; revelations written by the Prophet Joseph Smith). This
revelation explains and clarifies more about man's eternal destiny than any
other recorded revelation. It could easily put an end to the strange and
confusing precepts of men concerning heaven and hell.

Information in this chapter is divided into the following four categories:
(1) General, (2) Telestial, (3) Terrestrial, and (4) Celestial.

General

Joseph Smith: (TPJS, p. 311)

&quot;But,&quot; says one, &quot;I believe in one universal heaven and hell, where all go,
and are all alike, and equally miserable or equally happy.&quot;
What! where all are huddled together--the honorable, virtuous, and
murderers, and whoremongers, when it is written that they shall be judged
according to the deeds done in the body? But St. Paul informs us of three
glories and three heavens. He knew a man that was caught up to the third
heavens. Now, if the doctrine of the sectarian world, that there is but one
heaven, is true, Paul, what do you tell that lie for, and say there are
three? Jesus said unto His disciples, &quot;In my Father's house are many
mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place
for you, and I will come and receive you to myself, that where I am ye may
be also.&quot;
* * * * *

[133] Brigham Young: (JD 8:154)

The sectarian world, as we call them, is a professed church of God without
the Priesthood. Sectarians have not the Priesthood; but all of them who live
according to the best light and intelligence they can obtain through
faithfulness to what they believe, as taught unto them, will receive a
kingdom and glory that will far transcend all their expectations,
imaginations, or visions in their most excited moments, whether in their
falling-down power, jumping power, or squawling power. All they have ever
desired or anticipated they will receive, and far more; but they cannot
dwell with the Father and Son, unless they go through these ordeals that are
ordained for the Church of the First born. The ordinances of the house of
God are expressly for the Church of the First born.
* * * * *

Brigham Young: (JD 8:152-153)

I will read a portion of the vision Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon had
concerning various kingdoms that God has prepared for his subjects: (See
Sec. 92:7 Doc. and Cov., the then current edition--1860. Now Sec.
76:96-113.)
I do not know that I have any particular desire to dwell upon this any more
than any other subject of the Gospel, although, this subject, in the
abstract, occupies more of my affection, adoration, and heartfelt gratitude
to our Father and God than any other that has ever been revealed to my
knowledge, from the days of Adam to the present. * * *
I can truly say that, in my estimation, no other revelation so glorious was
ever given. You may read the character of the Deity as portrayed in all that
has ever been revealed, until you come to this vision, in relation to his
justice, his judgment, his power, his life, his glory, his excellence, his
goodness, his mercy, and the fullness of every gift, of every trait, of
every principle inherent in the character of the Supreme Being, and it is
not equal in [134] magnitude, in my reflections, to that which God revealed
to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in the vision from which I have read.
We are far advanced in the things of the kingdom of God. To say nothing
about any other principle or doctrine that has ever been revealed, the
transcending glory, excellency, wisdom, goodness, virtue, and power that God
has revealed in this vision far outweigh all the Christian tenets,
doctrines, and systems they have drawn from the Bible. No cistern, to use a
figure, hewn by man, can hold water; and every human doctrine and principle,
professing to point the way of salvation, fades away. The doctrine God has
revealed here is more precious to me, and is worth more than all the
doctrines of Christendom.
* * * * *

Brigham Young: (JD 17:159)

I expect one thing will be true that Joseph said when living. A gentleman
came to see him and asked him a great many questions, and among the rest he
said: &quot;I suppose you calculate that you are just right, and that you
&quot;Mormons&quot; are all going to be saved and everybody else will be damned.&quot; Said
Joseph, &quot;Sir, I will tell you this one thing, all the rest of the world will
be damned, and I expect that most of the &quot;Mormons&quot; will be unless they do
better than they have done.&quot; The man did not stop for an explanation. What
Joseph meant by being damned was that people will go into the spirit world
without the Priesthood, and consequently they are under the power of Satan,
and will have to be redeemed, or else they will be forever under his power.
That is all there is about that.
* * * * *

John Taylor: (JD 26:133, 1883)

We are told that if we cannot abide the law of the celestial kingdom we
cannot inherit a celestial glory. Is [135] not that doctrine? Yes. &quot;But,&quot;
says one, &quot;are not we all going into the celestial kingdom?&quot; I think not,
unless we turn round and mend our ways very materially. It is only those who
can abide a celestial glory and obey a celestial law that will be prepared
to enter a celestial kingdom. &quot;Well,&quot; says another, &quot;are the others going to
be burned up?&quot; No. &quot;Do you expect everybody to walk according to this higher
law?&quot; No, I do not. And do I expect those that do not are going into the
celestial kingdom? No, I do not. &quot;Well, where will they go?&quot; If they are
tolerably good men and do not do anything very bad, they will get into a
terrestrial kingdom, and if there are some that cannot abide a terrestrial
law, they may get into the telestial kingdom, or otherwise, as the case may
be.
* * * * *

Parley P. Pratt: (Key to Theology, pp. 143-144)

The final state of man, though varying in almost infinite gradations and
rewards, adapted to his qualifications and deserts, and meted out in the
scale of exact justice and mercy, may be conceived or expressed under three
grand heads or principal spheres, viz.:
First. The Telestial, or least heaven, typified by the stars of the
firmament.
Secondly. The Terrestrial, or intermediate heaven, typified by the moon.
Thirdly. The Celestial, or third heaven, of which the sun of the firmament
is typical.
The qualifications which fit and prepare intelligences for these different
spheres or rewards are an all important consideration, and well worthy of
the sincere attention of all people.
These several kingdoms or degrees, and their comparative happiness, and
what characters are candidates for each degree, are revealed in a most
concise, clear, lucid and beautiful manner, in one of the visions of our
great Prophet and founder.
* * * * *

[136] Joseph Fielding Smith: (Doctrines of Salvation 2:287-288)

Elder Orson Pratt many years ago in writing of the resurrection and the
kind of bodies which would be raised in these kingdoms said:
&quot;In every species of animals and plants, there are many resemblances in the
general outlines and many specific differences characterizing the
individuals of each species. So in the resurrection. There will be several
classes of resurrected bodies; some celestial, some terrestrial, some
telestial, and some sons of perdition. Each of these classes will differ
from the others by prominent and marked distinctions; yet, in each,
considered by itself there will be found many resemblances as well as
distinctions.&quot; * * *
Some of the functions in the celestial body will not appear in the
terrestrial body, neither in the telestial body, and the power of
procreation will be removed. I take it that men and women will, in these
kingdoms, be just what the so-called Christian world expects us all to
be--neither man nor woman, merely immortal beings having received the
resurrection.
* * * * *

Joseph Fielding Smith: (Doctrine and Covenants 138:58-59, &quot;Vision of
Redemption of the Dead&quot;)

The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances
of the house of God, and after they have paid the penalty of their
transgressions, and are washed clean, shall receive a reward according to
their works, for they are heirs of salvation.
* * * * *

[137] Telestial Kingdom

Times and Seasons: (p. 84)

These are they that deny not the spirit of God,
But are thrust down to hell, with the devil, for sins,
As hypocrites, liars, whoremongers, and thieves,
And stay 'till the last resurrection begins.

Doctrine and Covenants 76:81-90, 98-112:

And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that of the
lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs from that of the glory of the
moon in the firmament. These are they who received not the gospel of Christ,
neither the testimony of Jesus. These are they who deny not the Holy Ghost.
These are they who are thrust down to hell. These are they who shall not be
redeemed from the devil until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even
Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work.
These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of
the Holy Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial; And the
terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial. And also the
telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to
minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them;
for they shall be heirs of salvation.
And thus we saw, in the heavenly vision,

&gt; RE: Your question:

&gt;  What Happens to People Who Never Hear the Gospel ? Do They Burn in
&gt; Hell ?

&gt;  Answer:  &quot;Not necessarily.&quot;
">

Necessarily, is the claim of your missing messiah that those the do not
follow him and proclaim him board would never enter onto heaven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Is King David in Hell? Is his son, King Solomon?

&gt;   Answer:  No! Neither is in hell.

Nice try at misdirection, according to the Hebrew Bible, they are in sheol.
That was the common fate for everybody that died prior to the Babylonian
vacation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Is Joshua in hell?  Is Jeremiah? Is Noah?  Is Jonah?
&gt;   Is Ruth? Is Esther?
">

You don't know, Jeremiah, probably, remain for never having heard of heaven
or hell, remained in sheol.  Of course, to find that out would require you
to have knowledge about the Hebrew Bible.  Instead of the Greek Testament,
then you can speak from a base of knowledge instead of making special
pleading in demanding special exceptions, that the Hebrew Bible does not
support.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   No. They're all in heaven.
">

No, they are not.  For you claim so means it's your private interpolation,
which is pretty much everybody knows is anything except scriptural.
But nobody expects much better from you, for a biblical scholar ™ you are
not, even though you pretend to be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   NONE of them lived long enough (or even in the right century) to
&gt; have heard Jesus preach the gospel, or to have heard any of the
&gt; apostles.
">

But they heard of yahwee and followed his word.  Something you will never
understand is that your missing messiah does not triumph the God of the
Judea.  For a Judean, there was only one god and its not yours.  You don't
get to make the rules for god.  Even though you pretend, you can.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  So there MUST be some middle ground to &quot;You MUST have heard the
&gt; gospel preached by Christ.
">

There is no middle ground and for you to pretend that there is, is for you
to demand an exception to the Word of god.  You lack the authority, you
lack a lot, but the authority.  You certainly do lack.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   The answer is right there in the Bible.  You just have to look.
">

And twist, and redefine, and redefine, in redefining, and redefined, etc..
Nowhere is such a concept forwarded in the only true scripture, the Hebrew
Bible.  You do not understand enough basic history or societal dynamics
before you can even begin to understand why this is so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  And you don' t need the Book of Mormon or the NWT in order to find
&gt; that answer.
">

No, all you need is the Hebrew Bible, according to it, we realize that
there is no messiah, and therefore, the Greek Testament is null and void.
To anybody is a serious student of first century Judea.  However, your
fantasy world requires such a missing event.  And you are welcome to it.

Which John W., the great wannabe Johnny?  Or the one that pretends to be a
scholar ™.  Even though he has not a clue as to what they actually do or
how they do it.  You may as well, pretend to be a scholar or a xian.  It
makes no difference in the long run.

I noticed your vanity would not permit you to do the right thing and remove
text.  You cannot reply to, or will not reply to.  I lack that vanity, and
I will do so now.

walksalone who has to wonder, is it that Johnny finds trolls irresistible,
or is it he finds chance to pretend to be a defender of the faith
irresistible.  Either way he's comical.

More scholarship™ from Johnny, or at least he thinks so.

You are mixing apples and oranges. The 1st Chapter tells the order of
creation.the 2nd does not. After God gave us the order of Creation in
chapter
1, He went
on to make other points. Chapter 2 and beyond.

Middle Ground = &quot;Jesus is not required for salvation&quot;.

So this is where your &quot;faith&quot; has taken you to - you reject Jesus Christ as

You're wrong. The Gospel was preached to the ancients starting all the way
from Adam as if the sacrifice of Jesus Christ had already occurred. They
looked forward to the day of Jesus just like we look back at it.

22 And thus it was that they became denoted by the term prophet, for the
testimony of the Son of God was given by the Spirit of the living God, his
birth among the children of men being yet many years in the future.
23 And these things were also known unto Adam, yea even the plan of
salvation was taught and revealed through the agency of the Holy Priesthood,
which is after the Order of the Son of God, and through the administration
of angels or messengers from time to time from the presence of the Gods.
24 And thus Adam's transgression in the Garden of Eden was forgiven upon
baptism for the remission of sins in the name of the Father and the Son and
Holy Ghost.
25 And he was born of God and through the plan of salvation voted upon from
before the foundation of the world, he did overcome the fall and had his
calling and election made sure and being filled with years did exhort his
children that they too might partake of Eternal Life by entering into that
path which is straight and narrow.

&gt;&gt;he
&gt;&gt;said: &quot;I suppose you calculate that you are just right, and that you
&gt;&gt;&quot;Mormons&quot; are all going to be saved and everybody else will be damned.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Said
&gt;&gt;Joseph, &quot;Sir, I will tell you this one thing, all the rest of the world
&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;be damned, and I expect that most of the &quot;Mormons&quot; will be unless they do
&gt;&gt;better than they have done.&quot; The man did not stop for an explanation. What
&gt;&gt;Joseph meant by being damned was that people will go into the spirit world
&gt;&gt;without the Priesthood, and consequently they are under the power of
&gt;&gt;Satan,
&gt;&gt;and will have to be redeemed, or else they will be forever under his
&gt;&gt;power.
&gt;&gt;That is all there is about that.
&gt;&gt;                                  * * * * *

&gt;&gt;John Taylor: (JD 26:133, 1883)

&gt;&gt; We are told that if we cannot abide the law of the celestial kingdom we
&gt;&gt;cannot inherit a celestial glory. Is [135] not that doctrine? Yes. &quot;But,&quot;
&gt;&gt;says one, &quot;are not we all going into the celestial kingdom?&quot; I think not,
&gt;&gt;unless we turn round and mend our ways very materially. It is only those
&gt;&gt;who
&gt;&gt;can abide a celestial glory and obey a celestial law that will be prepared
&gt;&gt;to enter a celestial kingdom. &quot;Well,&quot; says another, &quot;are the others going
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;be burned up?&quot; No. &quot;Do you expect everybody to walk according to this
&gt;&gt;higher
&gt;&gt;law?&quot; No, I do not. And do I expect those that do not are going into the
&gt;&gt;celestial kingdom? No, I do not. &quot;Well, where will they go?&quot; If they are
&gt;&gt;tolerably good men and do not do anything very bad, they will get into a
&gt;&gt;terrestrial kingdom, and if there are some that cannot abide a terrestrial
&gt;&gt;law, they may get into the telestial kingdom, or otherwise, as the case
&gt;&gt;may
&gt;&gt;be.
&gt;&gt;                                  * * * * *

&gt;&gt;Parley P. Pratt: (Key to Theology, pp. 143-144)

&gt;&gt; The final state of man, though varying in almost infinite gradations and
&gt;&gt;rewards, adapted to his qualifications and deserts, and meted out in the
&gt;&gt;scale of exact justice and mercy, may be conceived or expressed under
&gt;&gt;three
&gt;&gt;grand heads or principal spheres, viz.:
&gt;&gt; First. The Telestial, or least heaven, typified by the stars of the
&gt;&gt;firmament.
&gt;&gt; Secondly. The Terrestrial, or intermediate heaven, typified by the moon.
&gt;&gt; Thirdly. The Celestial, or third heaven, of which the sun of the
&gt;&gt; firmament
&gt;&gt;is typical.
&gt;&gt; The qualifications which fit and prepare intelligences for these
&gt;&gt; different
&gt;&gt;spheres or rewards are an all important consideration, and well worthy of
&gt;&gt;the sincere attention of all people.
&gt;&gt; These several kingdoms or degrees, and their comparative happiness, and
&gt;&gt;what characters are candidates for each degree, are revealed in a most
&gt;&gt;concise, clear, lucid and beautiful manner, in one of the visions of our
&gt;&gt;great Prophet and founder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The Resurrection&quot; by Ogden Kraut
&gt;&gt;&gt;Chapter 11

&gt;&gt; RE: Your question:

&gt;&gt; What Happens to People Who Never Hear the Gospel ? Do They Burn in
&gt;&gt; Hell ?

&gt;&gt; Answer:  &quot;Not necessarily.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Is King David in Hell? Is his son, King Solomon?

&gt;&gt;  Answer:  No! Neither is in hell.

&gt; How do you know this?

&gt; Acts 13:36
&gt; &quot;For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God,
&gt; fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:&quot;

&gt;&gt; Is Joshua in hell?  Is Jeremiah? Is Noah?  Is Jonah?
&gt;&gt;  Is Ruth? Is Esther?

&gt;&gt;  No. They're all in heaven.

&gt; How do you know this?
&gt; Do you have a way to see in to heaven and enumerate all who are there ?
&gt; Are you just projecting your wishes?
&gt; Or is there some actual doctrine to support the assertion?

&gt;&gt; &gt;  NONE of them lived long enough (or even in the right century) to
&gt;&gt; have heard Jesus preach the gospel, or to have heard any of the
&gt;&gt; apostles.

&gt;&gt; So there MUST be some middle ground to &quot;You MUST have heard the
&gt;&gt; gospel preached by Christ.

&gt; Middle Ground = &quot;Jesus is not required for salvation&quot;.

&gt; So this is where your &quot;faith&quot; has taken you to - you reject Jesus Christ
&gt; as LORD and Savior and allow for an unspecified &quot;middle ground&quot; that, for
&gt; all you know may be Islam, Mormanism, Humanism or any other random
&gt; religious teaching.

&gt;&gt;  The answer is right there in the Bible.  You just have to look.

&gt;&gt; And you don' t need the Book of Mormon or the NWT in order to find
&gt;&gt; that answer.

&gt; Then why do you reject the Bible that you just recommended and make up a
&gt; fictious &quot;Middle Ground&quot;?
">

God chooses and always has.

He will make happen whatever even if He uses the stars and rocks.

Who said I doubt?   You said without reservation that King David and King
Solomon are both in heaven.

In terms of YOUR position with God its a matter of faith, but to claim to
know who is in heaven requires something OBJECTIVE outside of your faith.
IOW,  you can't have faith for other people.   We have Scripture
specifically stating that David followed after God's heart.  We have the
bulk of the Psalms where David speaks prophetically and lovingly about the
things of our LORD.     We have evidence of David's faith AND of David's
Works, AND we know that he knew the gospel and firmly believed in the coming
Messiah.

You could have stated that without even cracking open your Bible - but to
say &quot;its in there&quot; says nothing because you don't have a track record of
convincing Biblical knowledge.

Also, with a wave of a hand you discount a millennia old debate on Solomon's
final disposition.  There is evidence that he died reprobate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  As I said, the answer to the question is there.
">

Yes, I know that you said that.   Apparently you are of the generation that
is void of knowledge and fashions your reality based on fantasy, wishes,
dreams, feelings and conjecture.    It is one thing to make a claim, it is
another to substantiate the claim.   You are quite capable of the prior but
lack dearly in the latter.
