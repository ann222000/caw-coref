War Has Made Baghdad Pre-Industrial

War is pushing Baghdad out of the 21st century and back to a bygone age
of ferrymen, midwives, donkey drivers and shepherds.

Books had always been Shalan Abdul Ritha's life. &quot;There's a famous
saying,&quot; he says: 'The Egyptians write. The Lebanese print. And the
Iraqis read.&quot; He used to sell hundreds of volumes each week at Baghdad's
fabled Mutanabi Street bookmarket. Then the war began, and the dapper
old men who were his most dependable customers no longer visited his
shop. Sales dwindled to only a few dozen books a week. Still, Ritha kept
the place open until March 5, when a massive suicide car bomb demolished
the market, killing at least 20 people.

Now, with his former livelihood in ashes and his college degree in
Arabic languages all but useless, he makes ends meet the same way his
father did nearly half a century ago—as a boatman on the Tigris River.
The boat itself is the very one that his father operated when Ritha was
just a baby. Now it's Ritha who ferries passengers back and forth across
the river, past the ruins of bridges that used to be heavy with traffic.
Corpses drift with the current, many of them bound and blindfolded, and
the sight of them horrifies the 43-year-old book lover. But every time
insurgents blow up another bridge, his ferry business gets busier.

While security is returning to some areas of Baghdad, modern
conveniences aren't necessarily following. The Iraqi capital is no
longer the place described in the old guidebooks, a metropolis of
casinos, culture and Western-run hotel chains, although vestiges of that
city can still be  found.

Instead, unceasing violence has thrust Baghdad back to a more primitive
era, forcing its people to take up pre-industrial occupations and
rediscover almost forgotten technologies. The collapse of municipal
water services has revived the profession of well-digging, especially in
the Green Zone, where foreign diplomats are reluctant to give up their
flush toilets and showers.

Donkey and horse carts are increasingly common on the capital's streets;
the animals are cheaper than trucks and less likely to be held up in
searches for hidden explosives. (A few years ago, after insurgents
launched a rocket attack on the Palestine Hotel from a donkey cart, U.S.
military investigators were able to follow the singed and ornery critter
home, where they detained its owner.)

On the lawns of mansions whose former owners are dead or in exile,
shepherds now pasture flocks of sheep and goats, a sight that might be
idyllic if not for the inescapable din of a city at war.

Homemakers in particular are relearning bygone skills.

One of the most visible signs is the return of the old-fashioned outdoor
bread oven, the tanoor. Before the war, many Baghdad families bought
their daily bread from commercial bakeries. Now they're looking for ways
to economize—and to avoid unnecessary trips along city streets that can
turn into a battlefield without warning.

Abu Ali, a 37-year-old cab driver, recently bought his pregnant wife a
tanoor. (He asked not to be identified more specifically for safety's
sake.) These days he worries about his wife leaving the house to buy
bread: &quot;Not long ago, armed men came by one of the neighborhood
bakeries, pulled a guy out of the queue, asked for his name and shot him
then and there,&quot; the cab driver says. Besides, his gas-fired home tanoor
makes bread cheaper than store-bought. In a pinch his wife can even use
firewood, which he scavenges from vacant lots or dumpsters he passes
while driving his taxi.

Midwives are another basic necessity now back from oblivion.

The 1980s and '90s were lean times for their profession, thanks to the
rise of medical facilities in Baghdad. &quot;Hospitals were everywhere, and
pregnant women were keen to give birth in hospitals for fear of the lack
of sanitary conditions [at home],&quot; recalls a 58-year-old midwife who for
safety asks to be identified only as Umm Ahmad—&quot;mother of Ahmad.&quot; She
was trained by her grandmothers and delivered her first patient's baby
in 1970.

These days, however, not even maternity wards are reliably safe from
insurgents and death squads. &quot;My job is flourishing again, after being
forgotten for many long years,&quot; says Umm Ahmad. Before the 2003 invasion
she was delivering only one or two babies a week. Now she gets one a
day, and sometimes more.

The at-home birthing business is so hot that amateurs are crowding in.

Back in the Saddam era, midwives were required to have licenses from the
Ministry of Health, and many of them had nursing-school diplomas. &quot;We
would give them lectures once a week, train them and give them gloves,
scissors and other medical equipment,&quot; says Dr. Eman Atra, an
obstetrician who worked with midwives before the war. &quot;We would not
issue a birth certificate for [deliveries by] nonregistered midwives.&quot;

But now, she says, the profession is effectively unregulated: &quot;I cannot
control an unregistered midwife or refuse to issue a birth certificate
for the kids she helps deliver. I fear she might send someone to kill
me.&quot; (Maternity wards are far from empty even now, partly because so
many expectant mothers are choosing to have Caesarian sections. It's one
way to cut the risk of going into labor at night, when curfews and
trigger-happy security personnel can make the streets even more
dangerous than usual.)

The time warp is especially noticeable in the Green Zone.

More than 10,000 Iraqi civilians live there among the high-priced shops
that cater to American tastes and incomes, and it's troublesome and
dangerous for the inhabitants to venture out into the city's unprotected
&quot;Red Zone&quot; to buy fresh meat, local bread and other basics of Iraqi
cooking. Vehicles and their occupants are subject to rigorous searches
at checkpoints, and bombers often target the entryways, causing gridlock
and lockdowns that stretch for hours.

Rather than face the risk and inconvenience, many Iraqis and foreign
contractors do their food shopping from a middle-aged couple who live
with their four children in a hut made of salvaged packing crates, not
far from the heavily fortified U.S. and British embassies.

Naish Hussein Ali is a shepherd, and his wife, Um Zina, bakes more than
400 loaves of bread a day, selling them for about 8 cents apiece. &quot;I
can't lie, business is better now than before the war,&quot; says Umm Zina,
who rises long before dawn every morning to fire up her tanoor.

Her brother's family keeps a big flock of sheep, often letting them
graze not far from Saddam Hussein's famous Crossed Swords Monument.
Stragglers sometimes trot onto the road dangerously close to fast-moving
oil tankers and military Humvees.

Although the clan herded sheep during Saddam's time, they didn't usually
pasture their animals where the Green Zone now stands. Even then it was
a heavily secured neighborhood frequented by government VIPs.

The family's sheep and goats are valuable commodities today; one large
fat-tailed sheep can fetch $300. &quot;Our customers are half Iraqis and half
foreign security contractors—mostly Nepalis who like to make goat
curry,&quot; says Umm Zina's nephew Saddam Khudhier Abbas, 28. He grins
proudly at his mixed flock of sheep and scrawny goats in a parking lot
where he has brought them to show. They scratch their backsides against
an armored BMW, perfectly at home in the new Baghdad.
