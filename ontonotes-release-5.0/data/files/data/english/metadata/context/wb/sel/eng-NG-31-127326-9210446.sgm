In Navlist 3926, under threadname &quot;Ted Gerrard's book&quot;, Mike Daly wrore-

&quot;Halley's method can only be as accurate as his lunar position knowledge.
No one published tables at that time (as Maskelyne did after 1767).
There was the raw data that was coming out of Flamsteed's observations
and other observers that may have been accumulating data.  Newton and
Halley published Flamsteed's data without his permission in 1712 but
what Halley used in the 1699 timeframe I don't know offhand.&quot;

=====================================

This note is for anyone interested in Halley's methods.

I attach scans of Halley's paper &quot;A proposed method for finding the
longitude at sea ...&quot;, which appeared in Philosophical Transactions (of the
Royal Society), vol 37 (1731) pages 185-195, for anyone who wishes to read
Halley in the original. Sorry about the awkwardness of the 2-page-at-a-time
layout, but it's the best I could do. It should allow you to print it out
and reassemble.

Most of the paper is a rewrite of Halley's supplement to Streete's
&quot;Astronomia Carolina&quot; or Caroline Tables, of 1710, with only unimportant
bits omitted.

Halley writes rather clearly, and, for his era, can even spell well. One
puzzle for readers of his paper may be his use of &quot;extra syzygias&quot;. Syzygy
(lovely word!) means simply alignment, and the Earth-Moon-Sun syzygies are
when the three line up, either at full Moon or new Moon. So Latin &quot;extra
syzygias&quot; means away from those syzygies, at dates nearer the Moon's
quarters. You might also need to know that the English league is three
nautical miles. And you might like to know that the &quot;domestick
circumstances&quot; that distracted him, were that his father had been murdered!

Halley knew more about the Moon's motion than any of his contemporaries. He
devoted much of his life to observing and predicting it. He didn't need to
rely on the published tables of others, though he gathered what he could. He
had been making his own regular observations of the Moon's position with
respect to the stars, from his home observatory in Islington, London, from
1682 to 84. We don't know what his new bride thought about that...

He tells us that he set up the same astronomical sextant that he had used
earlier in his survey of the southern stars from St. Helena. Alan Cook,
Halley's best biographer, (&quot;Edmond Halley; charting the heavens and the
seas&quot;, 1998) tells us that its radius was 5 feet 6 inches, quoting from
Halley's catalogue of Southern stars (1679), and Phil. Trans.vol. 12, no.
141 (1678), 1032-4 (neither of which I've read).

An astronomer's sextant was nothing like a navigator's sextant, of course;
they shared the same name because each had an arc of one-sixth of a circle.
It was intended for measuring the angle between two objects in the sky, just
as in a lunar distance, but often of the angle between two stars, to a
maximum of 60 degrees. It had no mirrors, but two separate telescopes, one
to view each object. Early sextants could swing their frame about on a
ball-joint, and then needed a pair of observers, one to align each
telescope, but Halley's probably had an equatorial mounting, and then one
observer could use it on his own. Cook includes a sketch, supposed to be of
Halley's sextant, made by De L'isle, which to my mind is somewhat suspect,
showing its possible use in measuring altitudes and zenith distances rather
than for angular separations.

His observations for those early years, November 1682 to December 1684, are
recorded in that supplement to the Caroline Tables of 1710. Mostly, they are
of Moon-to-star distances, noted to the nearest 10 sec of arc (sometimes to
5, when it's 15&quot; or 45&quot;). Sometimes just one observation, but more often two
or three repeats, all noted. There are many occultations and appulses noted
as well.

Anyway, the question arises; how did Halley predict Moon positions? There
were indeed tables published of the Moon, contrary to Mike Daly's claim
above, but these were nothing like as precise and detailed as Maskelyne
derived from Mayer in 1767. They dated back to Ptolemy! Intended for
astrologers, rather than astronomers. Halley was aware that the
simple-minded predictions available in his time were highly inaccurate. To
put them right needed an understanding of the dynamics, and Halley was
prepared to leave all that to Newton, whom he was sponsoring. Halley's
approach was a simple, empirical one that's rather easy to understand. He
reasoned as follows-

There are two important cycles in the Moon's motion. One refers to changes
in the plane of its orbit round the Earth; that plane is tilted in space at
about 5 degrees to the ecliptic (the path of the Sun through the stars). The
direction of that tilt changes greatly, from one year to the next, until
after 18 years or so, it's moved round in a complete circle and is tilting
just the way it started. The Greeks, and even the Babylonians before them,
were fully aware of that 18-year cycle.

The other is in the way the Moon's elliptical orbit changes. It comes
closest to Earth (perigee) once a month as it crosses the long-axis of that
orbit. But that long-axis doesn't stay put in space; it's direction shifts a
bit, each month, so that in only 9 years or so, perigee is back to the same
direction in space. After 18 years, it would have rotated twice.

It had been long known that after about 18 years (known as the Saros cycle),
eclipses tended to recur.

Halley worked out that after an interval of 18 years 11 days (which was an
exact number of months), the phase of the Moon would be the same, the
time-of-year would be nearly the same (within 11 days), the tilt of the
orbit and the direction of perigee would all be back where they were before.
So whatever those corrections to the simple predictions were (whether or not
they were understood) they would be almost exactly the same 18 years 11 days
later.

So as long as the Moon position had been carefully measured, 18 years and 11
days before, Halley could work out what the necessary corrections (they were
called &quot;equations&quot;) were, and make predictions accordingly, without needing
to understand all that dynamics. There were snags, of course. Those repeat
periods were not exactly 2 to 1. And there were other influences at work,
with a different timescale; particularly the resonance between the giant
planets Jupiter and Saturn.

Halley was 65 when he took over at Greenwich as Astronomer-Royal, which had
been stripped bare of its instruments by Flamsteed's widow, so he had
nothing to observe with until a year later. Nevertheless, he confidently set
up to observe a full 18-year cycle of the Moon's motions, and completed it
before his death in 1742, at 85! His paper, attached, was an interim halfway
report, after the first 9 years, when one perigee cycle had been completed.

What is of particular interest to us is the use of Moon predictions in
obtaining longitudes for Halley's two Atlantic voyages. He is rather
reticent about that matter in his Journal, usually stating only the date,
the star used for appulse, and the resulting longitude.

On his first voyage, telescope lunars (not lunar distances)  were observed
between 15 February and  12 June 1699, and after a spell in London London,
on his second voyage, between 5 December 1699 and 30 July 1700. The crucial
period, 18 years and 11 days before then, would be from early February 1681
to mid July 1682, and for that period, Halley would need Moon observations,
to make predictions for those later lunars. That was before the start of his
recorded Islington observations, in November 1682. So was Halley
systematically observing Moon positions, with respect to the stars, in that
earlier period? We don't know, but it looks a bit doubtful.

At the relevant time, Halley was travelling in Europe, with his friend
Robert Nelson. At the start of the period in question, Halley was in Paris,
with Cassini, observing the comet of that year (not Halley's) amongst other
matters. In mid- May, they were  travelling South, toward Rome; Halley
measuring latitudes as they went with an 18-inch quadrant. Did he carry a
telescope as well; all he would need, with the portable quadrant, for
observing Moon appulses and occultations? We know little about what he did
in Rome.

By 15 Jan 1682 he was back in Paris, and by 24 Jan he had returned, via
Holland, to London. With all that travel, it was not a good time for making
systematic observations of the Moon. So the question remains open; what were
Halley's Moon predictions, used to determine longitudes for his Atlantic
voyages, based on? Any ideas?

Thanks for that George. I cannot offer any insight  on how Halley obtained
the position of the moon for his Atlantic voyages, but your piece was
fascinating reading.

Regarding Halley's calculational method for determining the Moon's true
position... In fact, he didn't need one as long as he had a diligent
astronomer back home willing to measure the Moon's position as frequently as
possible. For mapping and surveying, where the position determined by
observations can wait to be calculated when we get home (as opposed to live
navigation where we want the position on the spot), we don't need any lunar
theory at all. Imagine an alternate history where the reflecting sextant or
a similar instrument was invented 2500 years ago. If some king or emperor
with money to burn had decreed it necessary, astronomers could have been
sent to the far corners of the known world. They could have determined
longitudes as accurately as any late 18th century lunarian. A team of
astronomers in the imperial capital would measure lunar distances every hour
of every night, and travelling observers would measure the same distances
whenever they could in distant lands. Then, upon returning home, with some
clearing calculations (which would have been possible given the state of
mathematics though definitely challenging) those observations made in
distant lands could have been compared with the reference observations made
at home and as easily as that the world would have been mapped --to an
accuracy as good as world maps in 1800 (in the real world). Of course they
would need to understand lunar parallax (Hipparchus probably did) and they
would have needed a basic refraction table (which would have been discovered
almost immediately after the invention of the double-reflecting sextant). Of
course, an accurate map like that is nearly useless economically unless you
have a 'live' navigation method to go along with it.

That is indeed perfectly true (though not for navigation, as Frank
recognises). Than was the basis on which Cassini and the French surveyors
collaborated to remap the Kingdom of France, using mostly Jupiter satellite
events. It was how James obtained a good longitude for James Bay (off Hudson
Bay) as early as 1631, by timing a Moon eclipse. After his return, he could
compare it with the same event seen in England, which he had arranged for
his friend, the astronomer Gellibrand, to observe if the London sky was
clear (it was). It called for a cooperative astronomer back home.
Unfortunately, Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal at the time of Halley's
voyages, was not made in that mould. His Moon observations at Greenwich were
only sporadic, rather that systematic, and he kept them close to his chest
for as long as he could possibly could; to the despair of Newton, who
desparately needed them to inform his calculations.

However, Halley was not working his longitudes retrospectively, though
that's all he would need to make his chart of variation when back home. He
was actually using those longitudes, on the spot, in real-time, to direct
his navigation, so Frank's suggestion did not apply. The very first lunar
appulse that he records, for 15 Feb (Julian) 1699 appears in his journal as
follows (from ed. Thrower, &quot;The three voyages of Edmond Halley ...&quot;, Hakluyt
Society, 1981, page 98 &amp; footnote 5)

&quot;This morning I observed the Moon apply to a starr in fascia sagittari ii
boreali and conclude myself 160 leagues more westerly than our account [i.e.
his DR position], and but 50 leagues to the East of Fernando Loronha&quot;. And
indeed, he arrived in Fernando Noronha on the 17th, so Halley's longitude
wasn't far out. And remember, it wasn't done by measuring lunar distance,
but by simply looking with a telescope, five or six feet long, at the Moon's
precise position with respect to that star, as they closely passed. And this
was 68 years before the first Nautical Almanac appeared, with its lunar
distances.

If course, there was much guesswork in such navigation, as charted coasts
and islands had great errors in their mapping, and Halley was able to report
to the Royal Society on his return that Brazil had been charted a degree out
in its longitude.

In my view, Halley has never been given due credit, as the first mariner to
measure longitudes at sea, on a proper scientific basis.

and for some reason he pointed to an anonymous contemporary review of
Halley's Southern-stars catalogue. I don't understand its relevance, but am
grateful for that mention, as I had not seen it before.

==================

But we need to examine Daly's words, that he complains have been misquoted
or convoluted; I'm not certain which. These were-
&quot;No one published tables at that time (as Maskelyne did after 1767).&quot; and
then went on to refer to &quot;raw data&quot;.from Flamsteed and others

Well, now he is playing with words. Lunar position tables WERE available at
the relevant date, particularly in the French &quot;Connaissance du Temps&quot;,
giving lunar ecliptic longitude and latitude for each day, with respectable
accuracy. Similar tables had been printed, with varying levels of
inaccuracy, right back to the beginning of printing, Regiomontanus in 1474.

If he had meant &quot;No one published LUNAR DISTANCE tables at that time&quot;, he
should have said that. But he was discussing Halley's lunar POSITION
knowledge. As Halley took no interest in observing lunar distances at sea,
and required only lunar positions, then only lunar positions were relevant
in the context; not lunar distances. And those lunar positions WERE
available at the time from other sources, if with somewhat less precision
than were Maskelyne's. Are those what Daly appears now to dismiss as &quot;raw
data&quot;?

If Mike Daly doesn't make his meaning clear, he will get misunderstood.

Of course they are raw data.  Halley did not go into his friendly,

Mike,

You appear to have missed the point of both George and Frank Reed's
post that Halley did not need a model; it could be done empirically
knowing that the moon was back in the same spot after 18 years x days
later, based upon data collected beforehand.

I am still having some difficulty in understanding what Mike Daly is telling
us..

I had pointed to predictions of the Moon's position, and particularly to the
&quot;Connaissance du Temps&quot;, available in Halley's time, and asked-

| &gt; Are those what Daly appears now to dismiss as &quot;raw data&quot;?

And he has replied-

Well, that's exactly what he could do, back in 1698. He could buy a copy of
Connaissance du Temps, for 1699, at Stationers' Hall, in London, which would
provide him with the position of the Moon in the sky, in ecliptic latitude
and longitude. I've little doubt that he did. I don't have a copy available
to tell me whether it would supply occultations or not (they are rather
local phenomena, which would have applied to Paris, not to mid-Atlantic, in
any case). But Halley required close appulses, not occultations, as I have
explained before. He was perfectly capable of deducing those from
predictions of the Moon coordinates and his own detailed knowledge of star
positions around the ecliptic. He had been doing that, routinely, for years.

But Mike Daly seems to be insisting that only information on past positions
of the Moon was available in Halley's time, and not predictions into the
future (I have tried to discover some alternative meaning, without success,
in his words quoted above, in case I'm accused once again of  &quot;misquoting or
convoluting&quot; his meaning). If that is what he is claiming, it's nonsense.
These, in &quot;Connaissance&quot; and elsewhere, were predictions, not history. It's
perfectly true, as I've said before, that those lunar predictions in 1699
were not up to the precision of Mayer's, in Maskelyne's 1767 almanac. They
wouldn't have qualified for the longitude prize. There's little doubt that
Halley, from his own observations, could do better. But Daly is telling us
(isn't he?) that no such predictions existed.

If, as it seems, he is describing those predictions in &quot;Connaissance&quot; as
&quot;raw data&quot;, that's simply abuse of language. Astronomer's real &quot;raw data&quot; of
Moon observations had been collected for many years, sifted and assessed,
fitted to the best model they could think of, and then that model was run to
produce future predictions for coming years. At least, that's how we would
describe their process in modern terms. &quot;Raw data&quot;?

Halley's proposal was to bypass much of that process by examining data from
one Saros cycle previous, if that detailed data had been available. It had
some strengths, and some weaknesses, as I have discussed. It was superseded
by better mathematicians than was Halley; Clairaut and then Mayer, who had
Newton's understanding of the dynamics to build on.

It's a minor distinction, but you wrote that there were NO ephemerides, or
at least that's what you appeared to be saying. George pointed out that
there WERE ephemerides which were not as good as the later N.A. but still of
some limited use for determining approximate longitudes. The existence of
further raw data is of some interest but probably not for Halley's
observations c.1700 (he had not yet accumulated enough data to make any
difference by that date).

I gotta qualify this a little, Fred.

First, George's description of Halley's attempt to determine a set of
empirical tables for the Moon's motion is distinct from what I was saying.
Halley had a specific theoretical hypothesis: that the Moon's position was
primarily subject to the same periodicity that was known from eclipses
(arising from the slow precession of the Moon's orbital plane and its point
of perigee). This theory, really more of a hope than anything else, led
Halley to make painstaking measurements over several decades. In the end, it
didn't work --the Moon's motion is simply more complicated than that. Since
Halley had not accumulated sufficient data (by his standards) by c.1700, I
don't know if he used any of this data for the observations that were at the
center of this discussion, but he may have.

Next, the method I was describing does not depend on any theory of the
Moon's motion at all. Just to make it more clear, let's consider an
imaginary historical scenario. Picture a small comet swinging past the Earth
in 1750. At perigee, a little tidal disruption causes some strong outgassing
which just happens to be aligned forward, in the direction of the comet's
velocity vector. Like a retro-rocket, this jet slows the comet and drops it
into a nearly circular orbit 50,000 miles away from the Earth (let's assume
it ends up in a nearly polar orbit --passing nearly over the Earth's N/S
poles-- so that the Moon's gravity does not kick it out of the system too
quickly). Astronomers of this alternate history marvel at the Earth's tiny
&quot;new moon&quot; and within weeks they realize that they have a tremendous
opportunity to map the Earth. They can observe the position of the
point-like nucleus of the comet-moon relative to bright stars from various
points and thus determine absolute time (GMT) and from that and observations
for local time, they will get fairly exact longitudes. Because the comet is
close to the Earth, it zips across the sky more rapidly than the Moon
resulting in very good longitude measurements. But there's a catch: as low
as it is, the gravitational motion is complicated enough that it is very
difficult to be sure but even worse, the comet continues to fire out jets of
gas and dust. Like random rocket firings from a spacecraft with a drunk
pilot, this outgassing makes the comet speed up, slow down, and in general
change its motion unpredictably. Even today, we would not be able to produce
preditive ephemerides for a sputtering comet like this. So those geographes
in that alternate history cannot hope to determine longitudes from
observations on the spot. Instead, they rely on reference observations by
observers at known locations back home. Each night astronomers in London and
Paris and other cities with good observatories would measure as exactly as
possible the position of the comet-moon relative to the stars. Then by
comparing those observations with measurements made by the travelling
astronomers after their return, they would end up with a detailed and
accurate reference map for future explorations, under the assumption that
some other method for measuring longitude became available later. And in all
of this NO predictive, theoretical model of the comet-moon's motion would be
required! Alas, for our alternate history astronomers, the orbit of the
comet-moon slowly became more eccentric until it eventually intersected the
surface of the Earth, by a tragic coincidence splashing down in the shallow
Atlantic just off western Europe and destroying all of western civilization.
Darn!

I suspected this was going somewhere silly with the invocation of an
alternate history. :)
