According to Douglas Jehl of the New York Times, , in a January, 2003
conversation with Tony Blair, George W. Bush said that he "wanted to go
beyond Iraq in dealing with WMD proliferation, mentioning in particular
Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea and Pakistan."

What is odd about this list is that Pakistan is a US ally and rolling
back its nuclear program would be impossible unless India gave up its,
as well (unlikely); Saudi Arabia is not known to have any "weapons of
mass destruction ; " and Iran's capability in that area is presently
very limited (no nukes, maybe some old mustard gas from the 1980s, and
unproved allegations of some experimentation with biological weapons).

How to explain Bush's strange agenda? Well, when someone doesn't read
the newspapers and doesn't know anything about the wider world, and just
accepts whatever close aides tell him, then he might easily believe 10
impossible things before breakfast. The real question is who his aides
are really working for, who wants Bush to believe these dangerous
fantasies.
