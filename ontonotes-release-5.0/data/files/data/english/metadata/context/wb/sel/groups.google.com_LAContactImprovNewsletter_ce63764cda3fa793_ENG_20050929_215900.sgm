Hi Movers!

Shel Wagner-Rasch, Sarah Leddy and Carmela Hermann are happy to announce the
initiation of an East Side Contact Improvisation Jam! As some of you know,
the summer contact series with organized by Sarah and taught by Shel was much
fun and as a result, we feel inspired to take the next step toward building a
Contact Improvisation community here on the East Side.

We are currently looking for several folks to become founders of the jam
with us. A founder is someone who can not only share weight during the jam,
but share the financial weight of renting the space. Our goal is to have
at least five founders to commit to the first
month (October). This would make it
possible for each of us to contribute ten dollars per jam (or less if there are
more than five). All money would go directly to renting the space. This is a
great opportunity to nurture your own movement practice, as well as nurturing
the dance community on the East Side!

Our space is:
Mission Street Yoga (1017 Mission St. South Pasadena, CA 91030

Our time is:
Thursdays from 4-6pm

If you are interested in joining us, either as a founder or as a drop-in
participant, please contact Sarah Leddy. (323) 350 2509;
&lt;&gt;sarah_le ... @hotmail.com or
&lt;mailto:s ... @shelwagnerrasch.com&gt;s ... @shelwagnerrasch.com
(Please contact us even if the time or place are a problem for you√ñ we want
to hear from you so we can make this work for as many people as possible!)

Yours,
Shel, Sarah and Carmela

Contact Improvisation (CI) is a dance form in which two or more people are
giving and supporting each other's weight. As the name suggests, the
movement experience is not pre-set, but improvised. It's incredibly fun,
challenging and self-illuminating.

Contact Improvisation requires no previous dance experience, only an
interest in exploring movement with other people. Students will learn to
safely fall, fly, ride, float, push and yield. With practice, students
learn to move with greater freedom as they begin to pay greater attention to
their inner impulses (to how the body wants to move).

CI is playful, respectful, fun, challenging, thoughtful, sensitive, curious,
awareness-building and insightful! It is considered a sport and an art
form, and, at its best, it builds communities in a safe and creative way.
