This is another very perplexing case of a little girl suddenly is taken
from her bed while she's sleeping. For four months the media had us
thinking  that some stranger entered the room while the parents weren't
present (in this case dining with others, leaving the 3 children alone)
BUT in a strange twist of evidence, the PARENTS are now the suspects! It
has been made public that the parents, who are both doctors in England,
sedated the children, so they would sleep, and they could go out for the
evening....WHY would a parent do such a thing?!  Also....the rented car
had body fluids in the trunk...a lot of hair, blood, etc., so now what
the heck is this all about?!

Do you find this all a bit suspicious and think that the mother and
father could actually have killed her (accidentally, or otherwise) while
they were on a &quot;family vacation&quot; in Portugal?

This is similar to the Jon Bonet Ramsey case, when she was murdered on
Christmas Day in her home, only THAT time, there WAS a body,
but....still that case was never solved either, and the parents were
under suspicion of her death also. I doubt if it will ever be proved
now...the mother died from cancer, and not sure about the father? Maybe
he's dead by now too?

As a parent and a grandparent, I absolutely can NOT fathom HOW in the
world a parent could ever murder their own child, but...unfortunately,
it happens way too much!

What do you think might have happened to Madeleine? Do you feel the
parents could be guilty of a crime?

P.S. My hubby always calls me Agatha Christy, cause I've always been

TV, and like reading about different cases.

&quot;Could&quot; be? Yes.
It's a tough call. Being tempered in American culture, where parents do
harm their kids way too often, I can't rule out the parents as suspects.
That said, I think the Portugese police are completely incompetent.
Three months to interrogate the parents!? Unreal. They should have been
fully interrogated the night that kid disappeared.
Right now, as before, I lean toward suspecting someone in the area they
were staying at. Either another guest that noticed them with the kids or
someone who works in the immediate vicinity. I think it's very possible
that they will find her and that it will be in close proximity to the
apartment they had rented. I don't think they will find her alive.

Certainly they could have. Why they would is a total mystery to me.
But the longer I live the more I see just how crazy this world has
become.

No, John Ramsey is alive and well. Last I heard he was &quot;friendly&quot; with
the mom of the girl who is missing from Aruba - the name is escaping

Yes - they are certainly under suspicion. You have to really wonder
how they could feel &quot;comfortable&quot; leaving their children in the room
alone while they went out to eat, drink and be merry. I'd be a nervous
wreck myself. Even if they aren't guilty and this is a horrible case
of misjustice and false accusations, their lives will never be the
same. It makes me sick to see how children are treated in this world.
As many good people are out there there are far too many evil ones
preying on the innocents.

I'd 'like' to think the parents are innocent - and still do.

Unlike the Ramsey's who I believe &quot;lawyered up&quot; fairly quickly, most
likely because they had rason to, the McCann's didn't lawyer up,
stayed in Portugal for weeks looking for 'Maddy', got celebs involved,
and even met with the Pope - these don't seem like the actions of
guilty people IMO.

The drama around reports of &quot;big&quot; evidence seems to be just that,
drama - which I believe is based mostly on leaked info, 'questionable'
leaked info at that.

I heard a report stating that the DNA evidense is something like
80%-88% conclusive to belong to Maddy.  Huh?!  80% to 88%?  WTH does
that even mean?  DNA is either conclusive or it's not.  I also heard a
report stating that determining the status of the found hair is a very
simple procedure that shouldn't take more than 2min under a microscope
to determin whether the hair did indeed come from a deceased person or
not - until the evidence is made public, I'll give the parents the
benefit of doubt.  The trace body fluids could have come from luggage
or belongings which the McCanns had placed in the rental car trunk,
the hair could have come from the same place or something as simple as
a shared hair brush.

I agree about the parents f*cking up badly on this - I can't imagine
ever having done something so irresponsible to my own child, even now
at 11yo, I'd never leave him alone in an empty house, apartment, or
hotel suite, not for fear of him being kidnapped, but for fear of him
simply having an accident or something, not to mention a child waking
to find no one else around - that could freak the hell out of them,
nevermind the 'Home Alone' movie bologna.

In this case, either the Portugal Popo has some really damning
hardcore evidence on the McCann's, or they've hit a wall, have zero,
and are grabbing at straws.

DNA testing is accurate, but not absolute. There is always the
possibility that the results of the test could match the results of
someone else's test, even if that possibility is extremely remote.

Most likely, they are using the DNA of the parents to determine whether
the DNA found could be the child's.

Well, I AM a Brit and it is certainly not common to leave kids home alone in
England although, apparently, many parents while on vacation feel it's OK as
long as you check on them frequently.  As a Brit, I personally wouldn't do
any such thing, and I know nobody else who does it either, but maybe while
on vacation the rules change.  It's BS, IMO and a cop-out for bad parenting.
I'd put money on the parents having knowledge of or doing the deed.

&gt;It's a tough call. Being tempered in

&gt; completely incompetent. Three months

&gt; They should have been fully
&gt; interrogated the night that kid

&gt; lean toward suspecting someone in the
&gt; area they were staying at. Either
&gt; another guest that noticed them with the
&gt; kids or someone who works in the
&gt; immediate vicinity. I think it's very
&gt; possible that they will find her and that it
&gt; will be in close proximity to the
&gt; apartment they had rented. I don't think
&gt; they will find her alive.

The shoddyness of the Portuguese Police Dept. has been questioned in
this investigation...I just can't figure out WHY it took almost 4 months
for them to get going on this case, and really &quot;dig&quot; into it, but look
HOW slack the police there were when Natalie Holloway disappeared on the
school  outing...it was almost as if they wanted to cover it up, or
close their eyes, and pretend it never happened, so weren't very
cooperative it seems?!

I don't think little Madeleine will be found alive either, after all
this time, and is too bad they can't come up with her body, as that
makes it nearly impossible  to determine what the cause of death was,
and WHEN, as they didn't rent a car for 3 weeks, I believe it was? after
the little girl's disappearance......very strange indeed???

After Susan Smith's actions, after she secured her two little sons in

Thanks for you input, actually glad to hear it - plus; in addition to
leaving such small children alone, they were left alone in a foreign

&gt; Christmas Day in her home, only THAT time, there WAS a body,
&gt; but....still that case was never solved either, and the parents were
&gt; under suspicion of her death also. I doubt if it will ever be proved
&gt; now...the mother died from cancer, and not sure about the father? Maybe
&gt; he's dead by now too?

&gt; As a parent and a grandparent, I absolutely can NOT fathom HOW in the
&gt; world a parent could ever murder their own child, but...unfortunately,
&gt; it happens way too much!

&gt; What do you think might have happened to Madeleine? Do you feel the
&gt; parents could be guilty of a crime?

&gt; Judy
&gt; P.S. My hubby always calls me Agatha Christy, cause I've always been
&gt; interested in detective work!  I always watch all those type of shows on
&gt; TV, and like reading about different cases.
">

Because Patsy Ramsey;
- She stated to have gone to bed the night of Dec. 25, but was wearing
the same clothing the following day.  Perhaps not a big deal to some,
but I don't think most women, especially well-to-do former beauty
queens, would do something like that; but again, could just be sloppy/
lazy?
- A report based on investigator's comments stated that Patsy's side
of the bed was also not slept in that evening.
- Patsy stated that she had personsally tucked JB into bed that
evening and that the little girl never got back up, but forensics
showed the contents of JB's stomach proved otherwise.
- Denying that she never visited such areas while wearing it; fibres
of the sweater that Patsy was wearing the evening prior to JB's death
and the day the body was discovered were found in key areas of the
crime scene; the blanket used to wrap JB's body, the sticky-side of
the duct tape over JB's mouth, and in the knots of the chord used to
strangle JB.
- Both Ramsey's failed an initial polygraph test given by a
polygraphist their own attorny hired, after having turned down a first
polygraph test which would have required drug/blood testing.  Drug
testing is required on more thorough polygraph tests because drugs
affect senses responses given by the testee.  This first test was
ruled &quot;inconclusive&quot; (they simply faield and the polygrapher gave up)
The Ramsey's then took a second polygraph test, again of their own
choosing, and Patsy &quot;failed&quot; again - rather than accept the &quot;failure&quot;,
the polygrapher in this instance modified his testing procedures which
allowed her to pass.
- The Ramseys lawyered-up quickly, hired a PR firm, PI's, then not
only praxcticaly hid from law enforcemrnt/reporters, but even moved to
Atlanta.  Not exactly hanging around to keep an eye on the
investigation, and more like hiding.  I know everyone addresses the
same event differently, but if my child were to go mising, I sure the
hell would do everything on the planet to 'cooperate' with the
investigation, elliminate myself as a suspect, and letting LE get on
with the case.

I'm sure there are more &quot;inconsistencies&quot; re:Patsy's complete
'innocence' in this.

The whole thing stunk, and stills does, to high heaven..
- A ransom note &quot;rough draft&quot;?!
- The specificity of the moneys in the ransom note?
- While low, experts reviewing the original ransom note stated a
probability of Patsy having written it.
- Bound and Duct-Taped tiny 6yo, when there was &quot;no&quot; duct tape to be
found by incvestigaors anywhere in the entire house?
- Strangled with chord, also nowhere to be found on the Ramsey
property?
- Stun Gun marks on a little 6yo?
- Evidence of prior sexual abuse of JB.
- 33 visits to a pediatrician with &quot;yeast infections&quot; for a 6yo in the
two years prior two her death.
- There is no viable evidence of an intruder/break-in, other than a
small open window in the basement (which John admitted to have broken
and conveniently initially failed to report to LE) also had no outside
evidence of entry.
- and on it goes....

&gt; August for their Christmas gigs, I occasionally get some confused
&gt; looking teachers wandering into my room asking why we're singing
&gt; carols.  It is a little strange, but well.....so is music!

Ha ha - yep, I'm singing as I'm passing out all those decorations that
apparently Costco is pushing already!!!!
I had my practice CD blasting in my player when I got home last night
and of course, as it is still warm around here, had my windows open
and I was singing along pretty loudly. Imagine what my neighbors are
thinking - LOL. No wonder they're always just a wee bit stand-

You know what I'm thinking Judy? BOUNTY GALS. Do you watch that new

lead gal, &quot;Jag&quot; is a real tough babe. It makes me laugh, tho. They are
out chasing bad guys around but all the while they're wearing skin

&gt; The Ramsey's then took a second polygraph test, again of their own

Yeah - but I try to avoid much of that psychological &quot;this is why they

strangulation JB was strangled from behind.  Well no shit Sherlock, I
wonder how many people are strangled with a chord from the front?!
DUH..
Fact is, no one knows what the hell goes through a murderer's screwed
up mind, and many of these &quot;professional&quot; psychoanalysts wouldn't know
a killer if he walked right up and jammed a knife in'em.

&gt;I'm not saying I think that's what

I think it was on the news about the possibility of the mother (why her
and not the father, I don't really know?!) sedating the children, so
they could leave them alone and go out for the evening, and that
Madeleine was given too much....and died, so then both parents were
involved in the coverup of her death, but haven't heard anything further
on that?

Same here, Callen...I will never understand HOW a parent could kill one
of their own children?! In so many cases it's the FATHER that gets rid
of the wife AND his children, and either flees, or kills himself, and
that makes me shake my head in bewilderment too!? If he's THAT angry at
her, for whatever reason, I can actually *see* how he could kill her in
a crime of passion, but then to look at his son, or daughter (or both)
and kill them too, is just beyond anything I can fathom ever!??!

My neighbors understand.  My license plate holder says it all:
&quot;Caution: Singer on Board.&quot;  :)  It helps to have one neighbor who is
a fine classical musician and teaches clarinet out of his home and
another neighbor whose son is a local band teacher.  One year, my
Madrigals, after finishing a gig, dropped on by my house and did an
impromptu caroling party for the neighborhood.  Gotta love those kids.

Recap -
1.  'CY', after staging that he is a Brit, &quot;conveniently&quot; leaves out
the fact that Brits just MAY drug their kids before heading out on a
wine binger for the evening, and has YET to deny it!!
2.  On cross examination, Sanna notes CY's misuse of a *common*
British term!!
3.  'CY' responds by explaining that he's been in the U.S. now for
13yrs, without &quot;convenient&quot; mention of his ever having lived in
PORTUGAL!!!

While the evidence is SO crystal clear, let's give 'CY' the chance to
better explain himself with a final question;  'CY', have you ever
driven a car?

&gt; Gee, Dave......you really know a lot about the Ramsey case!  Things I
&gt; haven't even heard, and it was such a headshaking case from the
&gt; beginning. I knew about some of these things, but you really have the

&gt; How about you come to work with Fille and I at our &quot;firm&quot;...we could use

Did you hear where Portuguese LE just issued a subpoena for;
- the daily diary Kate McCann kept while on vacation.
- Maddie's pink little stuffed animal, Cuddle Cat, which Kate has kept
in her possession since
Maddie's disappearance.
- Gerry McCann's laptop computer from which he blogged.

Way to keep an eye on that evidence Portugal!
Can you say, &quot;Fishing expedition&quot;?

Heh .. but really, there is just SO much crap that goes on out there -
it seems the whole world is going to hell in a hand-basket.  Perhaps
it's just those with children that get to me, but along with the
recent Maddie McCann story and the also mentioned Ramsey - you hear
reports like this one about a 6yo little girl in Texas who was
sexually assaulted and hanged;
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070912/ap_on_re_us/girl_dead_2
Just WTF?  'This' is to what man has come?  In times of relative
prosperity, freedoms, and the ability to make the most of ourselves
and for our families, we have absolutely sick fckrs like that running
around?  It boggles the mind - and reminds me to hit the firing range.

I hear you on that one, dave.  I bawled when I read that about the
little Corsicana girl.  I hope they find the monster who did that.  My
family used to drive through Corsicana on our way to Austin several
times a year and I always loved stopping at the Collins Street Bakery
there.

&gt; 1.  'CY', after staging that he is a Brit, &quot;conveniently&quot; leaves out
&gt; the fact that Brits just MAY drug their kids before heading out on a

CY is in fact NOT a he, and not only do Brits *not* routinely drug their
children, they also *do not* routinely murder (or commit manslaughter on)
their children and then try to cover it up with a story about leaving said
kids in a hotel room, alone in a foreign country while they go out on a wine
binger.  CY is officially denying that this has ever taken place by herself
or any other Brit personally known to her.

Yes, once again, 'daveparks' is right on the money.  CY has never in fact
lived in, or even visted Portugal, thus CY's assumption that the &quot;rules of
the Brits&quot; must therefore not apply while on HOLIDAY in another country.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

CY has in fact driven a car, and on both sides of the road.  Although I do
hasten to add NOT at the same time.

Why is CY talking in the third person?

I don't kno what they call that in the UK where you &quot;claim&quot; to be from
