I know, most of you either don't care or figured there was going to be
no omake challenge, but since I'm running it now, I think I'll be
releasing my omake challenges later in the year to try and build up
some antici...

...pation for the next set of challenges.

Those entering the omake challenges, standard team picking rules apply,
no one on the banned list, etc., however, this time, I'll give you the
challenge in advance.

This time, you must pick 3 female characters from anime and/or manga to
help out with who you're facing.  Someone has released Happosai from
Ranma 1/2, Roshi from Dragonball/Z/GT, and Jiraiya from Naruto, that's
right Team Pervy Sages. ;)

They're running amok in whatever city you're in, and you must deal with
it, as the FBI, CIA, et. al. are busy with the real criminals.

I'm in, with Team Lovely But Dangerous: Yomiko Readman (end of ROD the

of Card Captor Sakura).  Blade's fanfic-writing challenge starts on
Thursday, so I'll aim to have this finished by Wednesday.

Ok, Team Bubba for this one is Morisato Megumi from OMG, Cheung Michelle
from R.O.D. TV, and Kokonoe Rin from Kodomo no Jikan.  Morisato is a skilled
mechanic, so will study the targets and build suitable cage traps for each,
while Cheung will decide if pull or push is the better approach to getting
the targets to enter same.  If pull, she'll be the bait; if push, Kokonoe
will crank up her aggressive approach until the target willingly flees right
into the cage

Not a problem.  At least not from where I sit, and I believe I'm the

(I must be insane to take on both at the same time, but... hey, why

And I just realized that picking Chisame from the current Negima manga
gives me the perfect intro for the Challenge.  Those who've read chapter
191 should know exactly what I'm talking about when I mention she'll
need to go shopping as soon as she arrives...

There's a mild spoiler for Negima chapter 191 in this,. but it sort-of
drives the first part of the story.

And if I'd had more time to write it, I wouldn't have been quite so
anti-Mary-Sue as an insert character.  Sorry about that...

======================================================================

It was a quiet afternoon, on a day like most others... until the
Challenge summoning device switched itself on.  'That's odd,' I
thought, then I realized that there hadn't yet been an Omake Challenge
this year.

First to appear was Yomiko, with her nose buried in a copy of a book I
didn't recognize.  She looked up, smiled and nodded at me, and went
back to reading.

Next was Sakura, who was wearing her school uniform and rollerblades.
&quot;Hello, Rob-san,&quot; she said with a smile.

&quot;Hello, Sakura-chan.  It's good to see you again.&quot;

Finally, Chisame appeared, laying on the floor and acting as if she
was fighting for her life ... and naked from the waist up.  Her skirt
was the worse for wear, too.  &quot;Help!  Get this thing --  Oh, thank the
gods.  Eek!&quot;  That last was when she realized I could see her body.
She crossed her hands over her breasts (and I had to remind myself
that she's only 14 years old - girls that age should *not* be that
well-endowed) and blushed.

I turned around.  Quickly.  &quot;Hello, Chisame-san.  Would it be awkward
to say it's good to see you again?&quot;

&quot;Why would it be awkward?&quot; asked Sakura.

Oh, dear.  &quot;Yomiko-san, you're a teacher.  Please explain to
Sakura-chan why both Chisame-san and I are uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;Why can't you do that, Rob-san?&quot;

&quot;Because I need to go to my bedroom closet right now.  Blue plaid is
going to clash horridly with those striped stockings, Chisame-san, but
it's the only shirt I have that's thick enough to fully cover your
chest...&quot;

A few minutes later, I passed the shirt to Sakura, who took it to
Chisame.  Once Chisame was fully dressed, I re-joined the ladies.
&quot;I'm not upset that you saw my body, Rob-san.  It's better than what
was happening to me before I was brought here.&quot;  She smiled.

Wow, but she's stacked... er, cute... when she smiles.  She's *cute*
when she smiles.  No, she's *14* when she smiles.  Damn it.  Why'd she
have to be a non-moe girl from a harem-comedy-lookalike world?
&quot;Thanks.  I think.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any idea why we're here this time?&quot; asked Yomiko as she
closed the book she had brought with her and picked up my copy of
Pratchett's &quot;The Last Hero&quot;.

&quot;Not yet, no.  I'll take a radio with us while we go shopping.&quot;

&quot;Shopping?  For what?&quot; asked Chisame.

&quot;Clothes.  For you.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Right.&quot;

But when we got to the mall, we discovered what the Challenge was.
Rather, we discovered a side-effect of the Challenge - all the women's
clothing stores were sold out of undergarments.  Chisame asked the
clerks why there'd been a run on bras and panties, and learned that
a group of three men had been stealing women's undergarments.  More
exactly, the shortest of the three men had been stealing them ...
right out from under their wearers' clothes.

I asked her to get descriptions of the men while she bought a blouse
or two, so she went back to the stores to ask while Sakura and I
waited in the food court.  Yomiko was in the mall's bookstore, running
my credit card balance up.

Just as Sakura and I each finished off ice-cream cones, I spotted
Chisame walking back to us.  Then I looked up, while I wondered
whether to ask whether the jiggle while she walked annoyed her.
(She's only 14, I reminded myself.  Again.  Hindbrain, *don't* get me
into that kind of trouble.)

&quot;One of the girls my age said that they looked like they were really
good cosplayers, for old guys.  What did she mean by that?&quot;

&quot;There's an anime convention in town this weekend, Chisame-san.  She
probably thought they were getting ready for that.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  That *would* explain why she also complemented me on how much I
look like one of the Negima schoolgirls.&quot;  Chisame had changed into a
top that closely resembled her shool uniform blouse while she was in
the store.  No bra, though...  No.  Bad thoughts.  Don't go there.  It
doesn't matter how old she looks - she's 14.  &quot;She said they looked
like Happosai, Roshi, and Jiraiya.  I recognize the name 'Jiraiya'
from the Naruto anime; he's a pervert martial arts teacher, I think.
Do the other two names mean anything to you?&quot;

I sighed.  &quot;Both of them are also pervert martial artists.  We're
going back home - I need to do some Internet research.  Help me drag
Yomiko out of the bookstore, please.&quot;  (I lucked out - she'd only
bought $500 worth of books when we got to her.)

Once we were home and Chisame was running her laptop off my line
current, she ran a search on the local news websites for anything that
matched the supposed culprits' usual activities while I did some
Wikipedia research.  (I'd never use that site for anything serious,
but pop-culture references like the ones I needed were its specialty.)
We pooled our findings after a quarter-hour.

&quot;This is what they're like?&quot; asked Yomiko.

&quot;The dossiers understate their martial arts abilities.  It's going to
be nearly impossible to take them on in a pitched battle, the way we
did that giant robot earlier this year.&quot;

Sakura held up the Fight Card.  &quot;Would this help?&quot;

&quot;It might, if you combined the Power Card with it.  But I think that
even using both cards together would only put you on par with Jiraiya
or Roshi on a bad day.  Maybe.  I think you could probably use all of
your attack cards and still not match Happosai's fighting abilities.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Then how do we beat him?&quot;

&quot;Let me think about that.&quot;  I turned to Chisame.  &quot;What have you got?&quot;

&quot;From the pattern of their activities, it looks like they're heading
somewhate east of the city center.  Does that help at all?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh, God ... they're headed to the part of town with all the
nightclubs.  On Hallowe'en.&quot;

&quot;Hallowe'en?&quot; asked Chisame and Sakura.

&quot;In this part of the world, it's the night when it's acceptable to
dress up as a fictional character, go out and have fun.  They're going
to blend in with the crowds until they show off their abilities.&quot;
Then I realized what I was saying.  &quot;And so will you...&quot;

A half-hour later, I was stuck in traffic downtown.  Chisame stayed at
my home, running support for us over the Internet and guiding us in
roughly the right direction by tapping into the various CCTV feeds
available online.  (She wasn't a front-line fighter, and I didn't need
the distractions my hormones were still throwing at me.  Once again, I
reminded myself that she's 14 years old.)  Yomiko was in the passenger
seat, and Sakura shared the back seat with a large suitcase filled
with old newspapers.

Sakura spotted Jiraiya at the same time that I found a parking spot.
By the time I had parked and paid, he was gone... but we heard more
than a few screams of indignation from the direction he was headed.
&quot;Let's go.&quot;

As Sakura released her staff, Yomiko put a few layers of paper under
my clothes.  ('Always nice to have some armour,' I thought as it
became as hard as rock.  'Just in case.')  We took off in the
direction of the screams.

&quot;There they are!&quot; yelled Sakura as she pointed at the trio of martial
arts masters.  They heard her and scattered.

&quot;Wouldn't they have been more powerful togther than alone?&quot; asked
Yomiko.

&quot;Each of them is powerful enough already,&quot; I replied.  &quot;Both of you,
be on your guar--oof!&quot;  I fell forward, the wind knocked from my
lungs.

&quot;You hurt Rob-san!&quot; cried Sakura.

&quot;Well, he seems to know about us.  I can't have him helping you, can
I?&quot;  I think that was Roshi's voice, maybe.

As I regained my wits, I saw Yomiko keeping Roshi's (I was right)
attention by throwing business cards at him.  Sakura was saying
something I couldn't quite make out through the ringing in my ears,
but I heard the ending words: &quot;Jump! Sword!&quot;

&quot;Don't kill him!&quot; I yelled as Sakura's staff gained an edge.

She just leapt over me and Yomiko, landing directly in front of Roshi.
The staff-turned-blade sliced down; he casually raised both hands to
capture the weapon; and the sword went right through them and him.

&quot;Oh my God...&quot; I said in shock... then was shocked again to see Roshi
was apparently unharmed.  The onlookers realized the same thing and
applauded; they must have thought we were street performers of some
sort.

&quot;I didn't hurt him, Rob-san,&quot; said Sakura as her staff returned to
normal.  &quot;He's just out cold.&quot;

Out cold?  From a direct sword blow?  Then I remembered the episode

Police can't deal with 'em, FBI, CIA, and the rest are dealing with a
really big potential threat, and if they stop to deal with the pervs,
something bad (like 9-11 bad) will happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm in, with Team Lovely But Dangerous: Yomiko Readman (end of ROD the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV), Chisame Hasegawa (current Negima manga), and Sakura Kinomoto (end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Card Captor Sakura).  Blade's fanfic-writing challenge starts on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thursday, so I'll aim to have this finished by Wednesday.

&gt; And I made it with a few hours to spare...  (Yay!)

And I'll say this upfront, you passed.  I've already read it, and will
now MST3K it...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's a mild spoiler for Negima chapter 191 in this,. but it sort-of
&gt; drives the first part of the story.

&gt; And if I'd had more time to write it, I wouldn't have been quite so
&gt; anti-Mary-Sue as an insert character.  Sorry about that...

Sorry about being an anti-Mary-Sue?  What is the world coming to?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ======================================================================

&gt; It was a quiet afternoon, on a day like most others... until the
&gt; Challenge summoning device switched itself on.  'That's odd,' I
&gt; thought, then I realized that there hadn't yet been an Omake Challenge
&gt; this year.

&gt; First to appear was Yomiko, with her nose buried in a copy of a book I
&gt; didn't recognize.  She looked up, smiled and nodded at me, and went
&gt; back to reading.

&gt; Next was Sakura, who was wearing her school uniform and rollerblades.
&gt; &quot;Hello, Rob-san,&quot; she said with a smile.

&gt; &quot;Hello, Sakura-chan.  It's good to see you again.&quot;

&gt; Finally, Chisame appeared, laying on the floor and acting as if she
&gt; was fighting for her life ... and naked from the waist up.  Her skirt
&gt; was the worse for wear, too.  &quot;Help!  Get this thing --  Oh, thank the
&gt; gods.  Eek!&quot;  That last was when she realized I could see her body.
&gt; She crossed her hands over her breasts (and I had to remind myself
&gt; that she's only 14 years old - girls that age should *not* be that
&gt; well-endowed) and blushed.

*hums to get his voice in tune*
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I turned around.  Quickly.  &quot;Hello, Chisame-san.  Would it be awkward
&gt; to say it's good to see you again?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Why would it be awkward?&quot; asked Sakura.
">

Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees and the flowers and the
trees and the moon up above...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, dear.  &quot;Yomiko-san, you're a teacher.  Please explain to
&gt; Sakura-chan why both Chisame-san and I are uncomfortable.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Why can't you do that, Rob-san?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Because I need to go to my bedroom closet right now.  Blue plaid is
&gt; going to clash horridly with those striped stockings, Chisame-san, but
&gt; it's the only shirt I have that's thick enough to fully cover your
&gt; chest...&quot;

&gt; A few minutes later, I passed the shirt to Sakura, who took it to
&gt; Chisame.  Once Chisame was fully dressed, I re-joined the ladies.
&gt; &quot;I'm not upset that you saw my body, Rob-san.  It's better than what
&gt; was happening to me before I was brought here.&quot;  She smiled.

&gt; Wow, but she's stacked... er, cute... when she smiles.  She's *cute*

&gt; have to be a non-moe girl from a harem-comedy-lookalike world?
&gt; &quot;Thanks.  I think.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Do you have any idea why we're here this time?&quot; asked Yomiko as she
&gt; closed the book she had brought with her and picked up my copy of
&gt; Pratchett's &quot;The Last Hero&quot;.

&gt; &quot;Not yet, no.  I'll take a radio with us while we go shopping.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Shopping?  For what?&quot; asked Chisame.

&gt; &quot;Clothes.  For you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh.  Right.&quot;

&gt; But when we got to the mall, we discovered what the Challenge was.
&gt; Rather, we discovered a side-effect of the Challenge - all the women's
&gt; clothing stores were sold out of undergarments.  Chisame asked the
&gt; clerks why there'd been a run on bras and panties, and learned that
&gt; a group of three men had been stealing women's undergarments.  More
&gt; exactly, the shortest of the three men had been stealing them ...
&gt; right out from under their wearers' clothes.

What a haul!  What a haul!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I asked her to get descriptions of the men while she bought a blouse
&gt; or two, so she went back to the stores to ask while Sakura and I
&gt; waited in the food court.  Yomiko was in the mall's bookstore, running
&gt; my credit card balance up.

&gt; Just as Sakura and I each finished off ice-cream cones, I spotted
&gt; Chisame walking back to us.  Then I looked up, while I wondered
&gt; whether to ask whether the jiggle while she walked annoyed her.
&gt; (She's only 14, I reminded myself.  Again.  Hindbrain, *don't* get me
&gt; into that kind of trouble.)

&gt; &quot;One of the girls my age said that they looked like they were really
&gt; good cosplayers, for old guys.  What did she mean by that?&quot;

&gt; &quot;There's an anime convention in town this weekend, Chisame-san.  She
&gt; probably thought they were getting ready for that.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh.  That *would* explain why she also complemented me on how much I
&gt; look like one of the Negima schoolgirls.&quot;  Chisame had changed into a
&gt; top that closely resembled her shool uniform blouse while she was in
&gt; the store.  No bra, though...  No.  Bad thoughts.  Don't go there.  It
&gt; doesn't matter how old she looks - she's 14.

Young girl, get out of my mind, my love for you is way out of line...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;She said they looked like Happosai, Roshi, and Jiraiya.  I recognize
&gt; the name 'Jiraiya'
&gt; from the Naruto anime; he's a pervert martial arts teacher, I think.
&gt; Do the other two names mean anything to you?&quot;

&gt; I sighed.  &quot;Both of them are also pervert martial artists.  We're
&gt; going back home - I need to do some Internet research.  Help me drag
&gt; Yomiko out of the bookstore, please.&quot;  (I lucked out - she'd only
&gt; bought $500 worth of books when we got to her.)

Well, that's because nothing in Canada compares to Jinbocho...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once we were home and Chisame was running her laptop off my line
&gt; current, she ran a search on the local news websites for anything that
&gt; matched the supposed culprits' usual activities while I did some
&gt; Wikipedia research.  (I'd never use that site for anything serious,
&gt; but pop-culture references like the ones I needed were its specialty.)
&gt; We pooled our findings after a quarter-hour.

&gt; &quot;This is what they're like?&quot; asked Yomiko.

&gt; &quot;The dossiers understate their martial arts abilities.  It's going to
&gt; be nearly impossible to take them on in a pitched battle, the way we
&gt; did that giant robot earlier this year.&quot;

&gt; Sakura held up the Fight Card.  &quot;Would this help?&quot;

&gt; &quot;It might, if you combined the Power Card with it.  But I think that
&gt; even using both cards together would only put you on par with Jiraiya
&gt; or Roshi on a bad day.  Maybe.  I think you could probably use all of
&gt; your attack cards and still not match Happosai's fighting abilities.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh.  Then how do we beat him?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Let me think about that.&quot;  I turned to Chisame.  &quot;What have you got?&quot;

&gt; &quot;From the pattern of their activities, it looks like they're heading
&gt; somewhate east of the city center.  Does that help at all?&quot; she asked.

&gt; &quot;Oh, God ... they're headed to the part of town with all the
&gt; nightclubs.  On Hallowe'en.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Hallowe'en?&quot; asked Chisame and Sakura.

&gt; &quot;In this part of the world, it's the night when it's acceptable to
&gt; dress up as a fictional character, go out and have fun.  They're going
&gt; to blend in with the crowds until they show off their abilities.&quot;
&gt; Then I realized what I was saying.  &quot;And so will you...&quot;

&gt; A half-hour later, I was stuck in traffic downtown.  Chisame stayed at
&gt; my home, running support for us over the Internet and guiding us in
&gt; roughly the right direction by tapping into the various CCTV feeds
&gt; available online.  (She wasn't a front-line fighter, and I didn't need
&gt; the distractions my hormones were still throwing at me.  Once again, I
&gt; reminded myself that she's 14 years old.)  Yomiko was in the passenger
&gt; seat, and Sakura shared the back seat with a large suitcase filled
&gt; with old newspapers.

&gt; Sakura spotted Jiraiya at the same time that I found a parking spot.
&gt; By the time I had parked and paid, he was gone... but we heard more
&gt; than a few screams of indignation from the direction he was headed.
&gt; &quot;Let's go.&quot;

&gt; As Sakura released her staff, Yomiko put a few layers of paper under
&gt; my clothes.  ('Always nice to have some armour,' I thought as it
&gt; became as hard as rock.  'Just in case.')  We took off in the
&gt; direction of the screams.

&gt; &quot;There they are!&quot; yelled Sakura as she pointed at the trio of martial
&gt; arts masters.  They heard her and scattered.

&gt; &quot;Wouldn't they have been more powerful togther than alone?&quot; asked
&gt; Yomiko.
">

Yomiko, don't give the opposition an idea...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;Each of them is powerful enough already,&quot; I replied.  &quot;Both of you,
&gt; be on your guar--oof!&quot;  I fell forward, the wind knocked from my
&gt; lungs.

Seemed you needed to follow your own advice...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;You hurt Rob-san!&quot; cried Sakura.

&gt; &quot;Well, he seems to know about us.  I can't have him helping you, can
&gt; I?&quot;  I think that was Roshi's voice, maybe.

&gt; As I regained my wits, I saw Yomiko keeping Roshi's (I was right)
&gt; attention by throwing business cards at him.  Sakura was saying
&gt; something I couldn't quite make out through the ringing in my ears,
&gt; but I heard the ending words: &quot;Jump! Sword!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Don't kill him!&quot; I yelled as Sakura's staff gained an edge.

&gt; She just leapt over me and Yomiko, landing directly in front of Roshi.
&gt; The staff-turned-blade sliced down; he casually raised both hands to
&gt; capture the weapon; and the sword went right through them and him.

&gt; &quot;Oh my God...&quot; I said in shock... then was shocked again to see Roshi
&gt; was apparently unharmed.  The onlookers realized the same thing and
&gt; applauded; they must have thought we were street performers of some

Oh, fine.

For the Team Returning Champions, they send in the alternates of
Jinzou Ningen 18, Ohi-Ma-Sho Kayura, and Locke will transform to his
Eliza (female) form.

For Team Technomagic, I only need to replace one character, as two
(Bulma Briefs and Honey-chan) are definitely female already, so
substituting for the Fullmetal Alchemist is... Izumi Curtis, scariest
housewife in the universe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no one on the banned list, etc., however, this time, I'll give you the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; challenge in advance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This time, you must pick 3 female characters from anime and/or manga to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help out with who you're facing.  Someone has released Happosai from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ranma 1/2, Roshi from Dragonball/Z/GT, and Jiraiya from Naruto, that's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right Team Pervy Sages. ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They're running amok in whatever city you're in, and you must deal with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, as the FBI, CIA, et. al. are busy with the real criminals.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pinoko, Fullmetal Alchemist

&gt; &gt; &gt; laurie (What?)

&gt; &gt; *Googles the choices*

&gt; &gt; So... not going the bait route...

&gt; Nope, going the &quot;date a girl your own age&quot; route

&gt; ;-)

Would that be... mental age, yes?  ^_^

*snort...giggle... BWAAAAAHAHAHA!*

Sorry, just seeing the words &quot;Shinji Ikari&quot; and &quot;overconfidence&quot; in
the same paragraph....

And damn straight. Unless you HAVE another DBZ character, you can't
match him power for power.

BUT he has other... weaknesses that one can play on. Confidence may
be one, though I'd just go for ego and echhi in general.

Well, here's an attempt:

Substitution has been made.  It's in the story below..

==========

I knew I should've read the instruction manual for that damn thing.

It's Halloween, and, with the entire San Francisco Police Department
busy murdering the city's Halloween party, I decided to dust off the
old Zap-I-Tron 2000 and make sure it's working for the New Year's
Challenges in two months.

Being in a decidedly interesting mood, I decided to hit the &quot;Test&quot;
switch and get the three leggiest anime characters I could think of at
the moment:

-- Azumanga Daioh's Sakaki
-- Full Metal Panic's Kaname Chidori
-- and Sailor Moon

So, I hit &quot;Send&quot;, only expecting pictures of the three.

So, to my surprise, I see two leggy (but VERY confused) students in
front of me, and a klaxon on the Zap-I-Tron.

Kaname:  &quot;Where the Hell is this??!?!?  And WHO are YOU??&quot;

Sakaki:  &quot;I'm not sure where we are either, but I guess we were
brought here by this guy...&quot;

At that point, I was still looking at the machine.  I pulled out the
instruction manual, went to &quot;Error Messages&quot;, and found the error
number -- 01.

I read out loud:  &quot;Error 01:  You may, at no time, summon any being
the makers of the Zap-I-Tron 200 declare omniscient or otherwise able
to defeat any situation without effort.  This includes:..&quot;

And I read down the list:  &quot;Great Will of the Macrocosm...  Fakir...  Aw
damn.  No Sailor Moon...&quot;

I was so thinking of her while thinking of the AnimeMyu performance at
a local anime convention end of next week.

I was then brought back to the present by a whack over the head with a
near-lethal paper fan.

&quot;OW!!&quot;

Kaname:  &quot;Don't 'OW!!' ME!!  What are WE doing HERE???&quot;

Sakaki:  &quot;Cool down...  Everything is going to be...   EEEEUGH!!!&quot;

At that point, I began to cringe.  A small bald man had immediately
decided to grab Sakaki's buttocks for a nice, hard squeeze.

What neither he nor I counted on was Sakaki's reaction to someone whom
I quickly researched as Happosai from Ranma ½ -- my trusty laptop
computer was helping out here:

A loud whistle, followed by &quot;SIC HIM!!!&quot;

Just then, I heard meows.  TONS of them.  Sakaki had &quot;summoned&quot; every
cat within about a one-mile radius.

I then joked:  &quot;Well, he may have wanted some pussy -- and now he's
really going to get it!!&quot;

Sakaki smiled at her handiwork.  Yes, Happosai was a martial arts
master, but was no match for repeatedly getting clawed to the ground
by a bunch of cats.

That is, until two things happened.  He countered the entire mess of
them away, much to Sakaki's fear...

... and Kaname felt a draft around her skirt.

I immediately went back to the laptop, and went &quot;OH SHIT!!  Now it's
WORSE!!&quot;

Kaname:  &quot;Yeah, it's a pervert that just licked me down _there_!!!&quot;

Jiraiya howled in glee - he knew none of us, not even with Kaname's
techniques as a Whispered, could deal with him alone, much less him
and Happosai, who was chasing Sakaki.

Kaname:  &quot;Enough of this!!&quot;

And she ran for the machine.  First, I thought she was going to smash
it.

She did something worse...

I yelled:  &quot;You know how to use that thing??&quot;

Kaname roared:  &quot;I'm a Whispered...  Let's see...  Female limitation...
Figures...&quot;

&quot;Melissa Mao...  Gear:  Arm Slave&quot;

I yelled:  &quot;HEY!!  That's right out of the Sousuke Sagara School of
Overkill.  You'll blow up half of San Francisco!!&quot;

Kaname:  &quot;Like I care.&quot;

And at that point, in front of me was a ten-story Arm Slave.

Mao:  &quot;Three hostiles sighted.&quot;

I dropped to the ground.  &quot;There's three of them...&quot;

Mao first found Happosai.  He had cornered Sakaki and was undressing
her with his eyes -- and preparing to do so with a lot more.

He noticed the Arm Slave, but his initial technique didn't stop him
from literally going several miles through the air -- last known
location, somewhere over Sausalito.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From my research, that might buy us 15 minutes.
">

The Arm Slave noticed Jiraiya coming behind it for a good look at the
woman riding it.  He wanted to ride her...

Of course, then Jiraiya was thrown into the air and smacked into the
bay, where he skipped over the water until he was somewhere near AT&amp;T
Park.

That probably would buy us 5 minutes.

And then the third small pervert showed up right in the window of the
Arm Slave.

He was licking the Arm Slave's window as if he wanted to lick the
woman inside.

At that point, forget anything else.  The bullets started to fly.

===================

Ten minutes later, and only because I actually had found (in the place
where I hid the Zap-I-Tron myself for New Years') the second machine
used to summon the three (whom I would later find out as Team Pervy
Sages) and de-summoned them, sending them back to their own domains
before Mao leveled San Francisco with a hail of Arm Slave fire.
Sakaki needed every cat she could find to deal with Jiraiya and his
battle field.  Kaname was watching as Happosai was returning.

I was about to slump into a bench by the Ferry Building -- one of the
few left, that is -- until Kaname broadsided me, paint-brushing me
with her paper fan.

Kaname:  &quot;You...  pervert...  I...  am....  Going.... To....&quot;

Mao:  &quot;Stop.  He might've wanted to drool at us, but, unlike these
three, he doesn't have the power to assault us and he knows it.&quot;

&quot;Whomever you are, can you get us back home?  They're going to notice
the Arm Slave is gone real soon...&quot;

Well, since it was technically a test run for later, I could de-summon
them like I did the Pervy Sages.

With few words, I got rid of those two.  Good luck to them back on the
Tuatha de Denaan.

I then turned to Sakaki.

I said:  &quot;So I guess it's over.  Sorry bout that.&quot;

Sakaki smiled:  &quot;I needed that.  The vet school I'm at right now is
teaching me to be more in tune with cats.  I guess it's working.&quot;

&quot;But I do have to go home...&quot;

So I prepared to de-summon.

I then said:  &quot;One more thing:  If you see Tomo, tell her to clear her
calendar for the New Year's holiday -- I may need her.&quot;

Sakaki:  &quot;Will do...&quot;

And then she disappeared -- at which point I smashed the other
machine.  Who summoned them anyway???

Ok, here goes, Team Bubba's effort, part 1 of 2

Whoever it was just did not understand or appreciate that it was
Saturday morning.  “All right, already!” I finally hollered, giving up
trying to sleep any further.  Putting on old sweatpants and a questionable
shirt, I stomped to the front door and yanked it open.

“Nice try, ‘Charlie’, a husky voice came from behind me.  “I don’t
do doors, remember?”

“Oh, cra – “

“Watch it, buster.  I’m not actually coming in.  I just need to
return this summoner to you.  Thank you so much for reminding Belldandy
about it last year.  She looked around the place, found it, forced me to
give it to Skuld to fix and insisted I get it returned to you as soon as
possible.  You’re going to need it.”

“Thanks, Urd-san,” I sighed, turning to face the television.
The goddess’ image was on the screen, looking stunningly beautiful, and not
the least bit happy.  Until she got a good look, raised a camera, and
stunned me with a flash.  “That ought to have some blackmail value,” she
snickered.  “Just remember to leave me alone from now on, and you’ll never
hear another word about it.”

“I promise,” I said.

“Then here’s your gizmo,” she told me.  She tossed it through,
about cracking one of my ribs.  “And I meant it about leaving me alone.  You
ever summon me again, I will do something I never wish to, things that will
make my mother proud.  I’ve never wished my mother on anyone before, but for
you I’ll make an exception.”  The television went black.

I looked the summoner over carefully.  Now that I had it back,
maybe I wouldn’t do as poorly in this year’s challenge as I had last year’s.
Wincing at the memory, it occurred to me I better test it, just in case.
Belldandy had been aware of the matter and the one who assigned Skuld to
repair it, but still.  It had to be a meaningful test, though.  I considered
a few minutes, then set it to bring someone from the distant past, someone
long lost, whereabouts unknown following an unfortunate and absolutely
undeserved demotion.  I summoned Sailor Pluto.

She wasn’t in a good mood either, or maybe still, I decided
after recovering consciousness.  The summoner was still there and intact,
though, probably because she had used it to send herself back.  It was
beeping now, however, that annoying crisis message alert noise.  The morning
was getting better and better.  I pushed the button to acknowledge.

“About time,” a grumpy voice declared.  “Well, now that you have
your device back, Special Agent Bubba, you are going to have to do something
about a problem that just hit your home town of Houston.  And it’s going to
have to be you.  The FBI, Texas DPS, Texas Rangers, and a few other groups
have looked at it and passed.  It’s not sexy enough to help them tap any
more of that Homeland Security money.  In the case of your local agencies,
not important enough to pry any of same out of the hands of your Port
Authority folks.”

“Ok, ok, just give me details,” I said, heading to get myself
some aspirin.

“The problem started with one too many published reports
pointing out that Houston is the sex business capital of your country, with
more adult entertainment businesses in total number and per capita than any
other,” the voice declared.  “With that saturation, the news came to the
attention of three notorious pervs, each of whom decided to come check out
the situation for themselves.  The names are Happosai, Muten Roshi, and
Jiraiya.  You have sufficient resources to research them.  Do so, figure out
where they are likely to be found, pick a team – all women recommended –
secure them and get them returned to where they belong.  Once you have,
actions will be taken on this end to block them from visiting there again –
hopefully.  That is all.”

Right.  I cranked up the computer, pulled up Wikipedia in one
tab, Google in another, and spent an hour clicking link after link and
making notes.  Happosai, lingerie thief, soft spot for children, easily
distracted by lingerie and pretty women. Roshi, likes young women, young
women in exercise shows.  Jiraiya, voyeur, mistrusts any interested woman,
enjoys sake, author of Icha Icha novels.   Ok, a few common threads, some
unique aspects of each to work with.  All the targets were martial artists,
so mechanics and magic were preferable approaches.  Team needs to be women.
Need someone who can build traps or devices quickly.  Need someone young,
seems innocent, yet knowledgeable enough not to be shocked into being unable
to function in a crisis.   Need an adult, preferably attractive, take charge
type, hopefully knowing some ‘magic’.  Mechanic – no.  Not Skuld.  I’ve had
enough of goddesses for one day.  But, from that - .

Five minutes more thought, and I had it.  I summoned Morisato
Megumi, Cheung Michelle, and Kokonoe Rin.  The three looked at each other,
then turned to me, frowning.

“Who I am is not important,” I said quickly.  “I need your help.
I have three perverts, all martial art masters, running loose in my town
here, and I need your help capturing them so I can send them back to where
they should be.  After which I’ll send you home.”  I introduced them to each
other, then bowed to Cheung.  “I chose you because you’re an excellent field
boss,” I told her.  “And a papermaster, which will be helpful for the traps
I have in mind.”

I turned to Morisato.  “You have advanced mechanical skills, and
can build anything described quickly from materials at hand, from what I’ve
heard.  You will probably be the most essential member of the team.”  She
blushed, looking happier.

I turned to Kokonoe.  “I apologize for bringing you into such a
situation, and assure you I will not, in any way, allow you to come to harm.
I read about you, what little I could find here in the U.S., and after the
things you’ve gone through and done, you can probably handle exposure to
these three as well or better than most adult women.  I will not compel you,
though.  The only thing I can offer you is that the experience may help you
deal with the people and the situations you have a bit better.”

“Never mind that,” she snorted.  “What do you want me to do to
them?  Tease?  Taunt?  Just don’t take forever about this.  I want to be
back at home with Aoki.”

“Right,” I sighed.  “Cheung-san, let us talk tactics.  Here’s
the info I have on our targets, and the approach I suggest for each.”  She
read them over, made some notes, discussed things with Morisato, tried to
engage Kokonoe – who mostly gave everyone but me a cold shoulder – then
decided we were ready.

Team Bubba, 2 of 2

I grabbed a ream of printer paper on the way out.  Cheung quickly
fashioned four flying ‘birds’ for us to ride, apologizing for not being as
good at them as her sister Maggie and urging us to be very cautious while on
them.  We flew to a mall, obtained a few other supplies, found a dump pile
where Morisato quickly put together several contraptions I had sketched out
for her and loaded them up, then went to a high tower to pinpoint the
approximate whereabouts of our targets.  Jiraiya was in the midtown area,
not far from Rice.  Happosai was around Hermann Park and the Medical Center.
Roshi was somewhere in the Memorial Park vicinity.  All in the southwest
part of town, not too far from me.  Jiraiya, being a writer, probably wanted
to be around people to spy on who would be interesting to listen to as well
as look at; Happosai was probably seeing if he could add nurse or doctor
items to his collection; while Roshi was probably enjoying watching the use
of the jogging trails.  Whatever.  I suggested Roshi first.  Cheung agreed
and directed the flying things in that direction, while I sat back with my
arms holding the summoning device tight, eyes closed, glad it wasn’t raining
for once.

We quickly spotted him and set up nearby.  Once ready, Cheung,
Morisato, and I hid nearby while Kokonoe approached Roshi.  “Hey mister,”
she called to him once she got close.  “Can you show me where the nearest
restroom is?  Quickly?”

“Hmm?  Eh?  Oh, certainly, my dear,” he responded immediately.
“Follow me.”  He led her to one we knew already was close by.  Next to the
woman’s side of it we had set up a framework Morisato had thrown together,
concealed by Cheung’s paper artistry to look like a small theater facility.
A sign had been placed near the entrance that read ‘Tsundere Girls Gone Wild
Private Test Screening, Invitation only.”  Roshi’s eyes lit up and he
wandered on in.   We watched, maintaining silence, while the master became
engrossed in the show, sitting on a comfortable ‘chair’, food and drink
nearby.  He soon fell asleep, smiling.  Cheung sealed the entrance, attached
paper wings to the cage, had it lift off the ground.  I set up the
transporter to a wild field, put in the coordinates I had been given, then
the thing flew through, landing gently on the other side on his private
island before the paper spell disbursed.  He wouldn’t be too put out when he
woke up, though, I felt sure.  He had at least 8 more hours on that DVD to
watch.  It was his problem if he couldn’t find a region free player.

With a little trouble we gathered Kokonoe and headed to the
Hermann Park area.  To my relief Happosai was in the vicinity of the zoo.
It would have been difficult to find him in the Medical Center itself.  We
set up the second of the traps Morisato had built, Cheung papered the walls
with a couple of Victoria’s Secret and Fredericks catalogs we had picked up
at the mall, then we tried to figure out how to draw his attention to it.
Michelle finally decided she would be the best for the job, gathered some
empty boxes, put some rocks and other things in them to provide some weight,
and began carrying them two at a time from one of the parking areas to
inside the trap.  I was waiting there, at a special spot she had set up,
took them from her and brought them back around to the back for her to
‘carry in’ once again.  By her third trip Happosai had noticed her, and on
her fourth trip he offered to help.  I exited the trap when I heard him come
in with her, sealing the ‘door’ I had used quietly.  She came out herself a
few minutes later, alone.  “Done and ready,” she smiled.  “I’ll have to
remember this Klein bottle trick.”

“So he’s wandering the halls, looking at pictures and oblivious
to everything else?” I asked.  She nodded.  “Ok, let me get into position.”
I set up the transporter and set it against the side of the Klein bottle
trap.  It only had one side on the inside, so it was probable after one pass
all the way around Happosai would be transported back and be Ranma’s problem
again.  The transporter registered it done, we checked the trap and he was
no longer in there, so we moved on to the last target.

Jiraiya had found his way into the Rice Village shopping region.
There was a used bookstore there, right across from a residential
neighborhood, and he was sitting outside a coffee shop right next to it.
Cheung looked the situation over, then suggested a change of plans.  We went
across the street and found a vacant lot just half a block away.  While I
and Kokonoe kept watch that we weren’t being watched, Morisato and Cheung
designed and constructed a house with half of what was left of that ream of
paper I had brought along.  Kokonoe was no longer needed, so I sent her on
back, then set up the summoner and transporter, placed it to cover the door,
and hid in a prepared place next to it.  Morisato took position in an attic
view port she had set up so she could let me know when they were almost
about to enter, and Cheung went back to the bookstore.  She entered the
bookstore and bought a number of items that caught her attention – I had
limited her to thirty bucks of local money so she wouldn’t be forever  -
making sure she had a large armful when she left there.  She used a few more
sheets she had with her to create and insert a few replicas of Jiraiya’s
books in the stack, then went to the coffee shop next door to buy something
to snack on.  While doing that, she stopped next to Jiraiya, looked at him
closely, and asked ‘Aren’t you - ?”

“I doubt it,” he said discouragingly.

“You are!”  she said, pulling one of his ‘books’ out.  “May I
have an autograph?  I have three others also.”

“You’ve read my work?” he asked, as we had hoped.  This was the
weak point of the plan.  If his surprise at being spotted and known didn’t
overwhelm him, he might remember it wasn’t his country and his works weren’t
available here.  Authors, especially obscure ones, tended to react with
brain overload when confronted by a fan, however, thankfully, and he was no
exception.

“Only one so far, but I’ll soon correct that,” she smiled at
him, managing to get all his volumes pulled out, then handing him a pen I
had given her.  “I apologize for intruding on you, and thank you so much.”

“No problem, and you’re most welcome,” he told her graciously as
he opened each and signed the title pages.  “There you go.”

“Thank you so much, and I wish I had time to remain and talk,
but I’ve got to get back, the wash is going,” she said, bowing and picking
up her load.

“May I help you with that?”

“Oh, no, no need, I’m only a block from home.  Thank you again.”
She walked away, not looking back.  As we expected, he couldn’t resist, but
waited until she was fifty feet away, stood up, and followed.  After she
crossed the light at Kirby and was back in the residential area, she opened
one of her books and began reading, paying no attention to anything else,
including the volume she dropped right before turning in at the walk leading
up to the construct’s door.  Once there, she struggled with it, finally
swung it inward, and entered, leaving it open behind her.  Outside, Jiraiya
came on up, picked up the volume, looked at it a minute, then came up the
walk, stood outside the door and called “Ms Michelle!”

As arranged, she didn’t respond.  He spotted a ‘table’ just
inside the door, but not close enough to reach from outside, so stepped in
to set the book on top of it.  Soon as he did, away he went back to the Leaf
Village, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

The three of us stepped back outside, Cheung dismantled the
‘house’ and presented me with the mostly organized ream.  I checked my
wallet, found us a cab to take us back to my dwelling, and sent the two
ladies home.  I checked to make sure Control was satisfied with the job, and
went back to bed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Team Bubba,

&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt; Excellent work, nice avoidance of conflict, and ...

&gt;&gt; You pass.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to retrieve something you
&gt;&gt; sent...  can't have technologies crossing over, causes... unforseeable
&gt;&gt; consequences.

&gt;&gt; *fires up the master device to retrieve the DVD Team Bubba sent to the
&gt;&gt; DBZverse*

&gt; Heh.  With as many of those DVD's as they press, he'll have no trouble
&gt; getting a replacement.  Probably be cheaper to buy your own copy than
&gt; run the electric bill up fetching that one.

Actually, a during the challenge 2 years ago, I went into the DBZverse
three times, they don't have DVD players.  During my trips, I got
familiar with some of their technology, and while they do have
something similar to VHS, it has zero degredation over years of
use/abuse.  I during my second trip, I watched a video that Goku had
pulled out of storage, and saw his marriage to ChiChi.    Time has
definitely been kind to her.

Back to the point... while some knowledge of this universe isn't
dangerous, our technology is.  All it takes is one item dropped off in
an alien civilization to do serious cultural damage.  (points to the
Star Trek episode with the gangsters)
