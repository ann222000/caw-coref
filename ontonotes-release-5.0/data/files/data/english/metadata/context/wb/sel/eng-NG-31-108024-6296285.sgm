We are currently in the process of having a masonry heater built.  We are
including the bread oven option.  I have decided that I want to learn how
to make sourdough bread in this oven.  I don't have much baking experience
though I have recently made a few batches of bread with baker's yeast in an
electric (convection) oven. They were edible.

I notice the FAQ had an article on Dan Wing's _The Bread Builders_ that
seems like a book I should be getting because it looks like it deals
specifically with sourdough baked in masonry ovens.  However, the review
says that it does not include recipes.  I suspect this means that I need to
supplement it with at least one other resource.  I think that I need a
book/web site that will be compatable enough with Dan Wing's advice so as
not to confuse me, suitable for a novice and supportive of my goal to bake
in my masonry oven. What do you suggest?  Thanks.

Howdy,

I'd suggest that you get the Wing book, and bake the bread
for which he provides a recipe (yes, there is one).

Keep baking that one bread (and keep a detailed log of such
variables as times and temps) until you have a sense of
mastery of the subtleties of its production.

Then, reach out for "recipes."

All the best,

I was a novice to masonry ovens - working ones, that is. I had baked
'normal' bread for more than forty years. I'd flirted with sourdough several
times over those years but none of the starters from any recipe book was as
good or long-lived as the one in that book so I regarded myself as a novice.

I suggest that you buy the book and read it. And then read it again. And
again. And try what's suggested in there. You should have a better
understanding of the processes of building the oven and making the starter
and making the bread. It's an inspiration.

There are those (among them me!) who say that just because something's in
print doesn't make it so. I agree. But there are exceptions.

By the same token just because something's on the net doesn't make it so.

Get the book, read it more than once because you might not take everything
in at the first go.

Then think.

Then wonder.

Then take the plunge. And enjoy!

Something I was not aware of until recently was the distinction between
a live fire Neapolitan Pizza oven and a traditional masonry oven.  In a
traditional dome shaped Pizza oven with a live fire the refractory
material is relatively thin and so heats up fast and can go to very high
temperatures (1000 F) as might be used in Neapolitan pizza.  In a
masonry oven the brick mass is enormous and so it takes a very long time
to heat and cannot reach super high temperatures because the sheer mass
of the brick is enormous relative to the heat source, but once the mass
is heated can maintain a relatively steady temperature for a very long
time.

Practically for somebody who does not bake much  having a short preheat
time may be advantageous and the Neapolitan design may be an advantage
because you like only want a few bakes out of a single firing.  In a
commercial bread baking environment, steady heat is what they want and
the masonry oven may be superior.

Since the oven looks like an add on to your heater what I am saying is
moot but if you are designing solely to bake bread you might want to
consider the Neapolitan design because it offers short preheat times and
the ability to both bake bread and reach ultra high temperatures for
very short bake (less than 1 minute pizza).

This is discussed at length at the forums of www.fornobravo.com (they
market kits for italian style pizza ovens but their forums cover a lot
of pertinent information).

That depends on what you call a very long time. I don't think a couple of
hours or so is a long time.

If you want to cook pizzas in my oven it's easy, you just leave a fire in
the oven, the pizza is cooked in minutes.

We did this for the first public cooking of our oven last year. Several
family members came round, from a four year old through teenagers, 20s and
their parents. I had dough and toppings ready, they built their own pizzas,
cooked them in minutes and ate them on the spot. It was raining but we
erected a canvas canopy over the eaters. It was a great success.

Yes, that is the kind we're getting.  The main purpose of the oven is
to heat the house (well, actually, the main purpose is to provide
something to sit around :-), and the bread oven is built in, but is
not the main purpose of the heater.

Since the heater is already in the finishing stages of being built, we
can't incorporate any suggestions about how to design it. Jayne does
want to learn how to actually use it, though.  But what you wrote

hi jan and vic,

you seem to be worried that you will need special recipes to bake in
your new oven. In reality baking and baking recipes (and grains for
bread) evolved alongside the hearth oven so modern recipes and baking
tips typically merely try to your new oven. For instance many recipes
require modern oven to be turned down part way through baking which
duplicates the falling temperature of a traditional oven (which
improves depth of crust and allows for the inside to get baked whilst
the crust doesn't get actually burnt). The main benefits of your oven
should be that you get good heat into sole of loaf from contact with
hearth and 'radiation' heat from oven walls which is very rare in a
modern oven.

the main question is to learn to manage the heat of your oven, which
Dan Wing's book does cover in depth, its not like turning a switch. As
mentioned by Roland http://www.fornobravo.com/pizza_oven_management/manage.html
is good short piece on oven management.

What concerns me a bit is that you seem to give the impression you
hope to bake bread in your oven simply by virtue of it bing next to
your fire. Without seeing pic or plans of you oven its hard to tell
how hot it might get just from its postion, maybe you will be able to
do slow pot roasts without any extra fire but its really unlikely you
will get up to bread baking temperature let alone for pizza. I have
seen several old farmhouse bread ovens in West of England and in Spain
that are in the wall inside the (big) fireplace but couldn't learn for
certain how they were used. Obviously one has a big pre-heat advantage
in this scheme but I have to assume the typical baking use is to
temporarily put some of fire into the oven till its up to right
temperature.

Which brings me to the mail from Roland re possible advantage of a
more thin walled oven for occasional baking. I think he is missing the
point that pizzas are baked with a least part of fire still in the
oven, as people remarked, baked very quickly, in mine http://www.myplot.org/oven/
typically one and half to two minutes. Usually a fire still inside
oven for bread baking would scorch crust long before inside was baked.
Curiously I just saw a Spanish baker's oven that was being used with
fire still inside but I think this was simply due to its vast size and
the comparatively small quantity of small loaves that the baker was
baking at a time (about four) http://www.myplot.org/oven/gallery.php?project=15&amp;prefix=chel
and in addtion he had to turn every loaf. Anyway without fire left
inside to bake you need retained heat to bake, and for that you need a
more or less thick oven wall. My adobe/cob oven's walls are about  14"
thick (and its outside), takes about 3 hours to get to baking
temperature from stone cold. If I baked every day it would take much
less time as its often still 200F/100C inside the next day. Maybe I
could of got away with a thinner oven wall but the design I used is
pretty tried and tested both from http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Own-Earth-Oven/dp/0967984602
and historically. Incidentally I have seen an originally coal/wood
fired oven in use behind Harrods, London, now fired with a giant
movable gas flame thrower (see Wing page 206), which has 22 courses of
brick in its oven walls and needed to be let out for two weeks before
repairs could be done inside.

Finally, as http://www.fornobravo.com and Dan Wing and Alan Scott book
on page 201 mentions you can either learn to use your oven by trial
and error and work out some kind of test for reaching baking
temperature such as flour thrown on hearth (how long foes it take to
smke?) or feel on your hand etc - or you can install some 'modern'
means of accurately measuring oven temperature. Unfortuately a normal
domestic oven thermometer is almost irrelevant, even the inside oven
wall temperature is comparatively little use, you really want to
measure the deep heat of your oven wall to check when you have enough
retained heat stored in it. Fortunately the functionality has improved
and cost come down  of infa red hand held temperature readers since
Wing/Scott book was written ($200 then). The model I now have I got on
ebay.co.uk cost me £27and is best of both worlds in this field since
it is both infa-red reader and takes link to thermo-couple 'K-type'
probes RayTemp 8
http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/RayTemp-8-Infrared-Thermometer_W0QQitemZ2600873...
have to say the despatch guy at the supplier company (they seem to
sell the model on ebay.co.uk fairly regularly) was really really nice
and friendly and since we were still in correspondence about which
type and length of probe I needed when he despatched he sent me three
different ones just in case at no extra cost (list price approx. £30
each)! And all of which I use http://www.myplot.org/oven/gallery.php?project=9&amp;prefix=tech
If you really want to measure the inside oven wall temperature you
will need to go over 2000 F (this infa red reader in itself only goes
up to approx 1000F) so you would need something like this 'high
temperature probe' at http://www.eti-ltd.co.uk/general_purpose_thermocouple.htm
(made up to right length for your oven wall so tip is just at or below
inside surface). However I find that probe such as 'penetration probe'
at same URL going up to 500F and measuring in middle of oven wall is
by far the most significant reading. Seems like you have probably
already built your heater/oven but ideally these probes should be
built in during construction, however I am sure you could drill out
with wall bit and then back fill with cement or whatever with probe
inserted.

good luck, post a pic of oven and baking results if you can.

Mine has about the same thickness but of brick and stone, it takes

I should have added mine takes 3 hours firing (with fire gradually
moving back to rear of oven from oven door) then half hour with embers
spread out, then half hour with fire out and door shut to even out
heat before swab and bread in - so much the same as yours

the "one mississippi, two mississippi" tactic at
http://www.fornobravo.com/pizza_oven_management/manage.html I have
found to be more or less true, at least for pizza

the sentence on same page

"the entire cooking dome will have turned clear, and the cooking
surface has reached the desired 750F for cooking pizza."

i.e. at a certain specified oven interior wall temperature what had
been previously soot covered will lose that soot cover is as accurate
as any digital thermometer if not more so. Usally I find I need I hour
burn after that point in order to get required heat stored in the oven
wall for bread baking. But all of these time things are obviously
variables (for instance if one has insulation around oven, when did
you last bake etc)

nonetheless, at least for anybody who likes to try baking as 'guest'
in more than one oven, as I do, I think an infa red thermometer and/or
themo-couple probe/reader is very useful. Viz my trails on a
reconstructed rural oven from the 1930's in Catalonia, Spain
http://www.myplot.org/oven/gallery.php?page=3&amp;ctrl=45&amp;project=14&amp;pref...
including using my earlier Raytek handheld IR reader (the model
mentioned in Wing/Scott). At this oven
http://www.myplot.org/oven/gallery.php?project=10&amp;prefix=ot&amp;proj=One%...
with help of probes etc I managed to bake more or less sucessfully
first time pizzas and then two loads of bread whereas its builder
hadn't managed a successfull bake since its building two years
previously (has to be said its construction is less than optimal with
very uneven wall depth - but hey they have a belching dragon oven
mouth)

If you do use a thermometer its good to keep a graph type record that
can end up looking something like this http://www.myplot.org/oven/images/tech/tech11.jpg
If anyone interested pdf of template for this at http://www.myplot.org/oven/oven_plot.pdf

Yes. And I agree with the sentence on the above page: It's often a good idea
to make some extra dough, and plan on cooking a few flat bread appetizers
before the serious cooking begins, just to get the feel for how your oven is
cooking. That's what I did at first and wouldn't rule out doing in the

I just want you to think about this:

Baking a few loaves at a time in a masonry oven
gives you a huge carbon footprint.

So you can tell me if I am wrong about that.

"So what??!" you say.  "So I'm already driving to the
supermarket every week in my SUV for five pounds
of flour, and I'm off to Bangkok in a jet to meet some
young girls."

Actually, intermittent use of any cooker which has a huge
heat capacity is uneconomic and environment-unfriendly
for a number of reasons.

The time has come for some one to design a bread oven
that can be rapidly heated and make 2, or just a few,
loaves.  Geothermal would be good.  Solar, too.

Resistance-heated might be a stop-gap solution, notwithstanding
transmission costs and carbon effluents at the source.

On the other hand, if you are baking, or cooking, a lot a retained heat
wood fired oven is the most energy efficient way to go.  You can start
with some pizzas when the oven is really hot, do two or three batches of
bread while it just hot, then roast some meat, and use the remainder of
the heat to cook some beans (or pumpernickel) overnight, or just to dry
out wood for your next bake.

You can also use a propane burner to heat the retained heat oven, which
will reduce soot and ash,  but probably not change the carbon footprint.

trailer full of scrap wood picked up on streets of London in an oven
made from London clay subsoil and pavement laying sand + bit of straw

It will change the carbon footprint. Propane, NG, etc. were
sequestered (in underground reservoirs) before they were released by
us. Therefore not a part of the atmospheric equation. Once burned,
well... the exhaust is water + greenhouse gas.

Wood, on the other hand, is neutral. It took exactly the same carbon
from the atmosphere as it will release when burned, or if never
burned, what it will release when it decomposes on the ground.

Depends. The turbine will run the entire house assuming everything is
electric. So if you figure your total energy bill... hot water,
kitchen, lights, heat, etc... No doubt it is still expensive... but
you typically sell surplus back into the grid. The trick is to predict
NG costs. That is about to go up, probably around $12 - $14/therm.

The turbine should last 25 years.

Wood, on the hoof, is vegetation, growing and supporting leaves,
performing photosynthesis, fixing carbon, removing "greenhouse
gas".  Doing much other environmental and ecological good, as well.

Wood does not necessarily decompose on the ground.  If it
did, none of it would have made its way to peat, coal,
petroleum, and natural gas.

Well it all depends on whose ox is being gored :&gt;)

10,000 years ago almost all of Minnesota was covered with a glacier.
There has been considerable warming since the peak of the last ice age
here in God's Country.  However, as I sit looking out at the current
blizzard and hope that somebody in the neighborhood has a new snowblower
that they need to try out on my sidewalks, I realize that the warming
has not progressed far enough for the North country.  Assuming it to be
true that CO2 assists in the warming, all this excessive fixation on
carbon footprints is troubling.  If too many cut back on carbon
oxidation, it will place a large burden on us warming enthusiasts to
make up the difference.  It is already hard to find enough tires to burn
for the Midsummer warming festival.

It would be nice if it would warm up fast enough so that I could replace
my crabapple tree with a peach tree.  However, the main benefit would be
that there would be a longer season to bake sourdough bread in an
outdoor oven.  Nobody is outside in the blizzard baking bread today here
in Minnesota.

Got to go throw another log on the fire.

I just want you to think about this:

Baking a few loaves at a time in a masonry oven
gives you a huge carbon footprint.

Not using wood. It's sustainable (often prunings, we've grown it
ourselves or acquired it from friends' gardens) and it would use more power
to dispose of it in other ways. The oven itself was built using mostly
reclaimed materials, only the mortar was new. I can bake a month's bread
(not just 'a few loaves') with one firing of that oven, it would take a lot
of electricity to do that in the kitchen oven.

So you can tell me if I am wrong about that.

You're wrong.

"So what??!" you say.  "So I'm already driving to the
supermarket every week in my SUV for five pounds
of flour, and I'm off to Bangkok in a jet to meet some
young girls."

You might be doing that, we use feet, bikes or a scooter and never,
ever, fly. Don't shop at supermarkets either, we buy locally grown and
(water)milled flour. We don't have an SUV, the car is only used for long
journeys, such as to the Scottish Highlands last weekend when we were unting
with hawks. All the rabbits are now skinned, gutted, jointed and in the
freezer, we're having the pheasant today. Our annual mileage is rarely more
than 3,000 (we keep a log). Other meat is reared by a daughter on her
organic, low input, rare breed Welsh farm.

Actually, intermittent use of any cooker which has a huge
heat capacity is uneconomic and environment-unfriendly
for a number of reasons.

Not when the heat is used progressively, to cook things which need
less heat after the bread has baked. This is what was done in the past in
Britain. It doesn't take much organisation.

The time has come for some one to design a bread oven
that can be rapidly heated and make 2, or just a few,
loaves.  Geothermal would be good.  Solar, too.

That is already possible and in use.

We think very carefully about ALL the energy we use, whether for
heating, power or lighting. We sweep floors rather than use a vacuum
cleaner, we light the table with beeswax (i.e. sustainable) candles. Only
spot lighting is used when we need personal illumination, using LEDs or
other low wattage lighting and we tend to go to bed early in the dark
months. Our central heating is rarely on, the house is well insulated and
the thermostat set to 10 C. We wear more clothes rather than turn on the
heating. We have solar water heating with a pv pump. We have our own hens
for eggs and grow most of our own vegetables.

What do you do?

aside from apparently lumping together buring fossil fuels and
releasing sequestered CO2 with buring wood in terms of release of
C02,  you also seem to be lumping together the release of green house
gases with creation of smoke/soot particles etc.

There is much evidence now that more let us say 'traditional'
pollution, creation of burn particles in the upper atmosphere by jet
flights for instance, may actually be giving an affect of 'global
dimming', reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the planet surface
and this is actually masking the full affect of 'global warming' in
much the same way that one paints one greenhouse with whitewash at
height of summer.

Sunlight reaching the planet surface is recorded as having fallensince
1950s by 22% over Israel, 10% over USA and  30% over some parts of ex
USSR

I am  not suggesting we should all burn wood and make more smoke in
order to counter-act global warming, more observing that a bit of
smoke doesn't do much harm, and perhaps more importantly observing
that if we suddenly stopped making so much visual spectrum pollution
for any reason, such as a break in the supply of fossil fuels, we may
suddenly find that global warming is already much worse than realised

You are wrong in our case, at any rate. Our masonry oven is part of the
heating system for the house and is burning wood anyhow. Using the heat to
bake as well as to heat is more efficient. The wood comes from dead trees
on the property which would create just as much carbon if left to
decompose.

I'm trying to learn two new skills at once - baking with sourdough and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In reality baking and baking recipes (and grains for
&gt; bread) evolved alongside the hearth oven so modern recipes and baking

&gt; duplicates the falling temperature of a traditional oven (which
&gt; improves depth of crust and allows for the inside to get baked whilst
&gt; the crust doesn't get actually burnt). The main benefits of your oven
&gt; should be that you get good heat into sole of loaf from contact with
&gt; hearth and 'radiation' heat from oven walls which is very rare in a
&gt; modern oven.

&gt; the main question is to learn to manage the heat of your oven, which

It looks a bit like the one here:

It is the same arrangement of firebox and oven although the facing is
different and the shape is not quite the same.  The documentation that came
with it claims that it can bake bread and pizza.

&gt; Finally, as http://www.fornobravo.com and Dan Wing and Alan Scott book
&gt; on page 201 mentions you can either learn to use your oven by trial
&gt; and error and work out some kind of test for reaching baking
&gt; temperature such as flour thrown on hearth (how long foes it take to
&gt; smke?) or feel on your hand etc - or you can install some 'modern'
&gt; means of accurately measuring oven temperature. Unfortuately a normal
&gt; domestic oven thermometer is almost irrelevant, even the inside oven
&gt; wall temperature is comparatively little use, you really want to
&gt; measure the deep heat of your oven wall to check when you have enough
&gt; retained heat stored in it. Fortunately the functionality has improved
&gt; and cost come down  of infa red hand held temperature readers since
&gt; Wing/Scott book was written ($200 then). The model I now have I got on

&gt; probes RayTemp 8

&gt; have to say the despatch guy at the supplier company (they seem to

&gt; and friendly and since we were still in correspondence about which

I'm leaning towards an infrared thermometer, at the moment.  I'll see how I

&gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt; can you give some details Mary? you throw a pile of flour down and

">

My earliest memories of home bread baking was in the early 1940s when my
mother did it, she made a lot of dough in a large pancheon. She cut cubes of
lard and arranged them rough the edge of the flour so that they'd gradually
be kneaded in. The pancheon was covered with a towel and left in front of
the inadequate coal fire for the dough to rise.

Her oven was an old gas one and the gas pressure varied according to
consumer demands. Things were very different then! When coal was more easily
come by she sometimes used the oven in the range, that was heated by the
fire coals and the bread was far superior. She used the flour method in that
oven too.

Because of the regulator not being reliable she used the flour system, I
assumed that everyone did! I was delighted to find references to it in other
books, including The Bread Builders - my bible :-)  I can't do better than
repeat what's in there on  p 197 (although I'm sure the Mississippi method
referred to by someone else will be more than adequate).

"The most common way (to judge the temperature of the oven)  is to throw a
handful of flour into the oven then watch the results. How long it takes to
turn tan, brown and black varies with the temperature of the hearth. For
loaf bread the flour should be quite brown at 15 seconds. If it starts to
burn right away, you either have to wait a while or mop the hearth again,
lightly, a couple of times."

At some stage I'm sure there WILL be soot on the oven walls but once the
fire is lit I don't look inside except to stoke. When I judge that the fire
has burned for long enough I look inside but by that time any soot has
burned away :-) There is a bit of darkening of the stonework above the door,

According to the instructions, we don't bake bread until the fire has gone
out.  There is supposed to be enough retained heat in the oven for baking
then (which I find easy to believe considering how well it heats the
house.) It is supposed to be too hot for bread while the fire is still
going.

You get low heat by waiting for it.  The fire is lit only twice a day and
burns itself out in a couple of hours.  The oven is hottest while there are
still glowing embers in the firebox (Well, it is hotter while there are
full flames, but you can't bake anything then.) The oven gets gradually
cooler over time and you put in the food when the oven reaches the right
temperature for it.

As I understand it, we don't regulate the temperature. We bake when the
oven is ready for it.  We plan the meals largely based on what the garden

have to say I would find this rather awkward to work with I think.
Since many sourdough recipes (or rather methods) require one to start
making up dough between one day and three days in advance and the
final point at which bread is put in oven being fairly critical in its
process of rising (the time slot when a loaf is neither under-proofed
or over-proofed from its final make up is probably about half an hour
maximum) - most of us either switch our modern oven or light our oven
fire at the dictates of the dough - which you won't be a liberty to do
(assuming your priority is heating your house)

the answers for you I think will be various. Infa red thermometer is a
nice gadget, but as I wrote before simply reading exterior and
interior heat of your oven in this way isn't always that helpful
(exterior obviously tends to reflect the ambient heat rather than just
the internal retained heat). In your case the interior surface heat
may be more useful than typically since effectively it will only be
retained heat. If you have to choose (ie you can't get the model I
mentioned that does both probe and infa red) then I might go for the
probe type themometer, these can be very cheap as they are produced
for car mechanics also. Either way I would strongly suggest you
initally do graphs of the falling temperature of your oven to work out
typical times for when it will be at whatever temperature (and for how
long)

The second tactic (aside from rather long term pre-planning) in order
to get your dough to dance to the rythm of your daily firings is to
make or find already existing in your house what professional bakers
call 'proofing cabinet' and 'retarder'. A proofer will speed up dough
development, a retarder will do the opposite. Classic domestic ready
made proofer would be dough in a tupperware in an 'airing cabinet' if
you have such a thing (sadly few do nowadays - there's nothing like
putting on fresh clothes from an air cabinet on a cold morning) - if
you don't have in your case I am sure you can make a cabinet at some
appropriate distance from your fire ensemble - but the result must be
an even all round heat and dough sealed in soemthing so as not to dry
out. A fridge can do the job of retarding if a bit harshly

I wasn't meaning that the initial mix time determines the end time,
however much later that might be, to within a half hour time slot,
since the main proof (including retarding if one goes in for that) is
surely more flexible. (Personally I don't bother with knock down proof
after main proof since I think that is a stage necessitated by rough
handling and extra dough added or subtracted to make exact dough
weight by professional bakers). What I was referring to is the moment
when the final proof dough (made up into loaves) is risen to its near
but not quite maximum and is therefore ready to go in the oven. If you
get it under you won't get the maximum size loaf you could, if you get
over you won't get much oven spring. Usual test I have read of and
more or less use is that a dimple poked in the dough with finger
should take no more than 15 seconds to substantially disapear. Left a
lot too long your loaf will probably deflate as you slash it, left
much too long (particualarly if it is anyway a wet dough or largely
rye dough) you'll just get a splayed shapeless thing like a cow pat.

In my case at this time of year, since I don't heat my home much, and
don't use any proofing box or cabinet, final  proof is between 2 and 2
and quarter hours and the antiquated gas oven for winter baking takes
one and half hours to get up to baking temperature ... In a warmer
house I would suppose the critical slot for loading oven was even
tighter. However with a lot stiffer doughs than mine (currently 74%
hydration for white) mayeb things aren't so critical.

I think I would find it harder but not impossible to live with an oven
whose baking time was not determined by myself as the baker, as Jayne
is I think suggesting will be the case for her but, its kind of so
novel a suggestion of a fire/oven setup compared to the traditional,
who knows (yet)? If the rate at which her oven's temperature falls is
very slow maybe there is quite a wide time window within which too
bake. It also occurs to me that maybe all my stuff about IR/probe
thermometers my be unecessary for her, since if her oven's inside
temperature is purely retained heat maybe a bog standard oven
themometer would be all she needs.

&gt; http://www.stovemaster.com/html_en/construction_sequence.html also

&gt; do you mind me asking where you are? The company seems largely russian

Alex, who runs the company, is a Russian immigrant to Canada.  He is our
neighbour here in Ontario, an hour or so north of Toronto. He clearly draws
on traditional Russian design.  Although ours is not for sleeping on, it
does have a heated bench to sit on.  I'm wondering if that can be adapted
for use as a proofer.

It is.  It burns very short and hot which reduces particulate and then
continues to heat because of its large thermal mass.

&gt;&gt; According to the instructions, we don't bake bread until the fire has gone
&gt;&gt; out.  There is supposed to be enough retained heat in the oven for baking
&gt;&gt; then (which I find easy to believe considering how well it heats the
&gt;&gt; house.) It is supposed to be too hot for bread while the fire is still
&gt;&gt; going.

&gt; have to say I would find this rather awkward to work with I think.
&gt; Since many sourdough recipes (or rather methods) require one to start
&gt; making up dough between one day and three days in advance and the
&gt; final point at which bread is put in oven being fairly critical in its
&gt; process of rising (the time slot when a loaf is neither under-proofed
&gt; or over-proofed from its final make up is probably about half an hour
&gt; maximum) - most of us either switch our modern oven or light our oven
&gt; fire at the dictates of the dough - which you won't be a liberty to do
&gt; (assuming your priority is heating your house)
">

Supposedly the times that the oven reaches certain temperatures is
consistent and predictable.  For example, it might always be bread
temperature 5 hours after firing.  So, if the dough's timing is predictable
too, it should be possible to coordinate them to occur at the same time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the answers for you I think will be various. Infa red thermometer is a
&gt; nice gadget, but as I wrote before simply reading exterior and
&gt; interior heat of your oven in this way isn't always that helpful
&gt; (exterior obviously tends to reflect the ambient heat rather than just
&gt; the internal retained heat). In your case the interior surface heat
&gt; may be more useful than typically since effectively it will only be
&gt; retained heat. If you have to choose (ie you can't get the model I
&gt; mentioned that does both probe and infa red) then I might go for the
&gt; probe type themometer, these can be very cheap as they are produced
&gt; for car mechanics also. Either way I would strongly suggest you
&gt; initally do graphs of the falling temperature of your oven to work out
&gt; typical times for when it will be at whatever temperature (and for how
&gt; long)
">

Yes, we certainly intend to figure out and keep written record of our
temperature times.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The second tactic (aside from rather long term pre-planning) in order
&gt; to get your dough to dance to the rythm of your daily firings is to
&gt; make or find already existing in your house what professional bakers
&gt; call 'proofing cabinet' and 'retarder'. A proofer will speed up dough
&gt; development, a retarder will do the opposite. Classic domestic ready
&gt; made proofer would be dough in a tupperware in an 'airing cabinet' if
&gt; you have such a thing (sadly few do nowadays - there's nothing like
&gt; putting on fresh clothes from an air cabinet on a cold morning) - if
&gt; you don't have in your case I am sure you can make a cabinet at some
&gt; appropriate distance from your fire ensemble - but the result must be
&gt; an even all round heat and dough sealed in soemthing so as not to dry
&gt; out. A fridge can do the job of retarding if a bit harshly
">

I read the recent post about somebody's homemade proofer.  It sounded
fairly easy to make, although it would be nicer to figure out a way to
incorporate the heater's warming bench.

&gt;&gt;You get low heat by waiting for it.  The fire is lit only twice a day and
&gt;&gt;burns itself out in a couple of hours.

&gt; If it's your main house heating, isn't it a bit constraining to have
&gt; to actually light the thing up twice a day - or do you in fact just
&gt; add more wood to the embers when you need to fire it again?

It is easier to light it twice a day than to constantly feed a conventional
fire.

Seems to me that would be simple... just invert a box or bus tub over
the dough placed on the warming bench... I'd still use clear or
translucent plastic for the ease of viewing but I suspect the proofing
times would be reliable and easy to coordinate with your oven.

I would experiment with different bread shapes and oven temperature.
You might find that you can bake a load of batards at a higher
temperature than boules. If so... you can sequence your loads by
shape.

I think you are going to have a lot of fun with this...

if you bake at regular intervals (preferrably often), keep your
sourdough culture fresh and well fed, don't tend towards experimenting
with or tweaking your recipe then yes, your total proofing time should
be pretty predicatble. However if you like fairly cold proofing (and
retarding) and like to tweak/experiment (like me I guess) you may find
main proof time (basically dough should double in size) is up to one
or two hours out from anticipated. I guess I get stricter and less
experimental with myself (and the dough) when I am going to use my
wood-fired oven than when I turn a knob.

It all depends on the results you are trying to achieve, the style of
bread you are making, and the conditions of your bakery.  In short, it's
a tool, like any other.

"Sourdough" is not a style of bread, unless you qualify it, as in "San
Francisco Sourdough French Bread."  Unqualified, sourdough is just a
riser and can be used to make any bread.

So, if you want a rustic bread with big holes, a single rise will help
you.  Each time you knock down the dough and reform it, the crumb tends
to become more uniform.  So, if you are trying for a pullman loaf, you
might be well advised to knock it down an additional time or two.

Also, at higher altitudes, it can help to get bread under control to let
it have an extra rise or two.

Most professional bakers handle their dough gently.  At least the
artisan bakers.
