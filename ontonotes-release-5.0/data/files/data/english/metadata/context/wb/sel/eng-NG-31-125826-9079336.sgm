A cyclist is facing jail after he ploughed into a man on a pavement at
25mph killing him.

Peter Messen, 28, hit Tesco storeman Gary Green, 41, as he loaded his
car to go on holiday to Venice with his girlfriend.

At Truro crown court yesterday Messen admitted causing bodily harm by
wanton or furious cycling in March last year. It carries a maximum two
years in jail.

At an inquest earlier this year witnesses told how Messen was riding
down a hill &quot;like a bat out of hell&quot; on his mountain bike. And seconds
before Messen mounted the pavement shopper Don Lowe shouted at him:
&quot;You are going to kill someone.&quot;

This guy is obviously guilty of nothing more than an honest mistake, just
the same as the rest of us. The idea of jailing him is abhorrent. Don't you
agree Doug?

Unless this is the same case, cyclist causing deaths may be more common
than the likes of Duhg admit. Someone in one of the rec.driving/cars
newsgroups mentioned recently that a friend had been killed by a
pavement cyclist. And when Duhg's mad chum Hansen claimed that he had no
knowledge of cyclists harming any person I found many references on the
web.

I have a suspicion that these incidents are under-reported or never
reported.

It can't possibly have happened. The &quot;newspaper&quot; must be imagining it.

Why do I say that?

Obviously, it's because we have been assured time and again that no
cyclist can possibly harm another road user and that they should all
be canonised forthwith. And each given a hundred quid a week out of
the poorbox to add to the considerably higher incomes they apparently
all have.

PS: Why wasn't he charged with manslaughter?

If you look at the figures you will find out that about one person is
killed by a cyclist every two years.  That compares with ten people
killed be drivers every day.

No idea.  But the sentence won't be a £100 fine and loss of saddle for
6 months, which would be what a motorist might expect for killing
someone while driving on the pavement.

I wondered that. I hope that it was at least considered.

One of the problems here, though, is that cyclists are being sent mixed
messages in a variety of ways. A lot of cycle lanes are now on
pavements. I must confess that these routes make me slightly uneasy and
I tend to stick to a very low speed when using them. Secondly, I wish I
had a fiver for everytime that I have seen a copper or a police support
officer riding a bike on the pavement, often in busy shopping areas.
I've even seen the pretend coppers riding at night, head to foot in
black, with no lights on!

Also, some junctions make it almost impossible for cyclists to safely
comply with the law. A good example is the junction between the Trans
Peninine trail and Tiviot Way in Stockport. You come off the trail and
meet a set of lights that take you over this busy road and allow you to
cut through a Tesco car park into Stockport. There is a cycle lane
marked right up to the stop line. It is for bikes. It is where bikes
should be and where I would like to be. Trouble is, bikes don't activate
the lights to change, so you could sit there complying with the law
until the bloody cows come home. The end result is that you have to
crash the lights or cross using the pedestrian crossing.

Still no excuse for doing a lethal speed on a pavement. I personally
think that a charge at least equal to causing death by dangerous driving
should be used against cyclists in such circumstances.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;A cyclist is facing jail after he ploughed into a man on a pavement at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;25mph killing him.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Peter Messen, 28, hit Tesco storeman Gary Green, 41, as he loaded his
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;car to go on holiday to Venice with his girlfriend.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;At Truro crown court yesterday Messen admitted causing bodily harm by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;wanton or furious cycling in March last year. It carries a maximum two
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;years in jail.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;At an inquest earlier this year witnesses told how Messen was riding
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;down a hill &quot;like a bat out of hell&quot; on his mountain bike. And seconds
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;before Messen mounted the pavement shopper Don Lowe shouted at him:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;You are going to kill someone.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Advertisement
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Click here to find out more!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Victim Gary of Stenalees, Cornwall, died from head injuries four days
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;later. Messen will be sentenced in November.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Comments please, especially  from Doug

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Peter

&gt; &gt;&gt;It can't possibly have happened. The &quot;newspaper&quot; must be imagining it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Why do I say that?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Obviously, it's because we have been assured time and again that no
&gt; &gt;&gt;cyclist can possibly harm another road user and that they should all
&gt; &gt;&gt;be canonised forthwith. And each given a hundred quid a week out of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the poorbox to add to the considerably higher incomes they apparently
&gt; &gt;&gt;all have.

&gt; &gt; Funny I have never seen such an attitude posted anywhere. Perhaps you
&gt; &gt; would like to show me a link to a post or two.

&gt; &gt;&gt;PS: Why wasn't he charged with manslaughter?

&gt; &gt; Why did he get such an absurdly low sentence?

&gt; What sentence is that?

&gt; The story reports that he will be sentenced in November.- Hide quoted text -

Sorry - misread it.

I was referring to the bit about the maximum of two years in  jail.

I don't think you have grasped the subtleties of Doug's thesis (not a
criticism of you - it is immensely complex).  My limited understanding
of it is that because, under anti-terrorism law, certain categories of
acts such as intimidation, threat/use of violence etc, can (if the
right conditions are satisfied) constitute acts of terrorism.  Ergo,
all instances of threat/use of violence (e.g. road rage) and
intimidation (tailgating) are acts of terrorism.  It has been pointed
out to Doug that other factors need to be present in order for it to
be terrorism e.g. the act in question needs to be done in furtherance
of a political cause.  No problem says Doug - the cause is &quot;wanting to
get somewhere faster&quot; (in the case of tailgating).

Impeccable logic, I think you'll find.

I don't think anyone would disagree with you. It's more or less the same

As a side note - we, as cyclists, really need a serious crack-down on
people cycling on the pavement. It's unnecessary and unsafe. Passing
through Dumfries before dawn on Monday morning I passed ten people on

It's more profound than that. Brian makes up his mind to dislike anyone
cleverer than he is. This accounts for around 98% of the British
population, indeed around 98% of the global population. He has also
decided that anything which is published which does not meet his narrow,
prejudiced view of the world can be ignored. If that publication is
referred to by someone smarter than him, such as you, then he refuses to
read it. This creates as sort of self-reinforcing spiral of ignorance.

Still at least as he has posted in the past he has associates who are
&quot;sex trade workers&quot; and publicans, so he can glory in the fact that
there are still people around who will listen to him.

Totally agree with you here. I see people cycling on the pavement
frequently even when the road is deserted (e.g. 11pm at night) which
puzzles me as I thought people cycled on the pavement for fear of
traffic.

Even some of the road cyclists don't seem to bother with lights at
night which again puzzles me as you can pick up a reasonable set of
lights suitable for urban riding at night for about £10. All you have
to do is fit them and switch them on.

&quot;terrorist&quot; - someone who engages in terrorism

&quot;terrorism&quot; - only general characteristic generally agreed upon is that
terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence

Whilst no-one can deny that this cyclist inflicted violence on another
person, and there is no excuse for that, have you considered that the
definition fits almost every motorised vehicle user much better than it fits
any cyclist?  Which group inflicts more violence on others, cyclists or
drivers? and which therefore, more deserves the appelation &quot;terrorist&quot;?

Have you written similar threads in response to drivers who have killed
pedestrians on the pavement, or just to this one?

Final question: what's it like being a hypocrite?

Well it's a message lost on many. I was out in Southampton yesterday and

Maybe it's because of the cyclists' fear of traffic?

It's a standard speedophile excuse to claim that late at night, the
streets are empty, so of course it's toadally unfair to ticket anyone
for speeding -- stealth tax and all that.

So naturally, it's reasonable for potential victims to be extra-cautious
on empty roads, late at night, when SafeSpeed morons are driving at
speeds &quot;appropriate to conditions&quot;, as judged by their moronic selves.

Whoosh!

Make no mistake: the comparison with terrorism (and not originally in
respect of cycling - far from it!) was made by someone else (and
before this thread was started) - certainly not be me.

Go back to sleep. There's nothing to see here. Move along (and that
applies to the others who have posted from the hip).

&gt; drivers? and which therefore, more deserves the appelation &quot;terrorist&quot;?

&gt; Have you written similar threads in response to drivers who have killed
&gt; pedestrians on the pavement, or just to this one?

&gt; Final question: what's it like being a hypocrite?

Is it not amazing how some people miss the point by a mile (or more).
I suggest that you check this group posts for motorist terrorist, the
results you get may help you to see the reason for my post.
Until then just lurk, unless you are Doug in disguise.

By the way I, have I messed Dougs comments?

Are you suggesting that using a hand held torch is somehow wrong or that you
