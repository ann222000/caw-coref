The Sierra Nevada Mountain Range serves as a beautiful backdrop to a spectacular region known for its natural beauty and year round activities.

Lake Tahoe is 22 miles long and 12 miles wide. Lake Tahoe has 72 miles of shoreline, making it the largest alpine lake in North America. The sun shines for three quarters of the year and the water in the lake is so pure that it is 99.7 percent clear! The 72 mile drive along the shores of Lake Tahoe is spectacular. It is listed as one of the most beautiful drives in the USA. In the winter months, the Lake Tahoe region becomes the largest concentration of ski resorts in North America. There are 19 ski resorts including terrain to challenge at all levels, and other winter pursuits such as sledding and snowmobiling.

Yosemite has become one of the ‘must sees’ for visitors to California. The rarefied mountain atmosphere of California’s Western Sierra is enhanced by the stunning scenic vistas of this truly unique part of the world. Yosemite is famous for its granite monoliths such as El Capitan, spectacular waterfalls and vast wilderness. Its scenic features include alpine wilderness, giant sequoia tree groves and the Yosemite Valley itself. The discovery of one tiny gold nugget set off the great California Gold Rush of 1849. You can still pan for gold. Experience what it was like to travel in the old days on a paddle steamer cruise, a steam train, or a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Discover quaint museums, tour a mine, explore caverns, taste your way through farm trails, or try white water rafting on some of the best rivers in the west.

The Squaw Valley is one of the top ski resorts in North America, and is world renowned. Squaw Valley resort hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1960. There is a large choice of activities to do here, including skiing and snowboarding.

The Napa Valley is less than one hour’s drive north of San Francisco. The rolling hills and sun drenched valleys of Northern California’s wine country have welcomed visitors since before the Gold Rush. The Napa Valley produces some of the finest wines enjoyed world over. Even if it did not, it would still be considered the jewel in the crown of North California. Kissed with bay fog at the valley’s southern tip which borders the San Pablo Bay and continuing 30 miles north to the base of Mt St Helena, the valley ranges from 1 to 5 miles wide, and is protected by low mountains on the east and west. It is surrounded with acre after acre of world renowned vineyards!
