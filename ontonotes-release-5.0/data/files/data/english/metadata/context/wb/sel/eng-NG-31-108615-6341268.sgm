If someone started flying over the air around a city, and no one could
detect them.  Let's say they kept flying around the sun, where no one
was looking.  Then lets say they started seeding the air with oil, and
chemicals.  So that the chemicals were to persist in the environment,
and freely contain themselves in the air.  Then they would just need
to drop a bomb hot enough to spark the chemical fire and ignite the
air.  I've read that once air gets hots enough it turns to plasma
anyway, and you can actually start chemical fires in the air using
nuclear physics.

What would you call a bomb like that?

Huge Gas Line Explosion Knocks Out Power to 30,000 People in Texas

Monday , March 12, 2007

ADVERTISEMENT

About 30,000 people reportedly lost power Monday after a massive gas
line explosion in Parker County, Texas.

Flames have engulfed 10 pieces of equipment and several cars. Early
reports say the flames could be seen from miles away. The flames
appeared to be fed from a gas line.

Bob Hopkins, the public information officer for the Weatherford,
Texas, Fire Department, told FOX News shortly after 4 p.m. that the
explosion took place after a high-pressure line operated by Chevron
ruptured.

"We can tell at this point the men were working on the line, it's
apparent by the backhoes around it, but we don't know what caused it,"
Hopkins said, adding that officials are not yet sure if there are any
injuries resulting from the blast.

Parker County authorities rushed to the scene, as flames rolled
several hundred feet into the air from a line in a rural area north of
Weatherford.

The area where the fire is raging is located about 30 miles west of
Fort Worth.

xxein:  It was once a great concern in the 1930's and 40's when the
nuclear bomb was being being contemplated and devoloped.  The science
of the day didn't know how a chain reaction might envelope unforseen
reactions that would permeate our atmosphere.

That was then.  We have certainly changed our atmosphere in the
intervening years and have the same initial confidence as when we
first performed this nuclear act.  There is no certainty that our
present polluted atmosphere will give the same results to larger
nuclear reactions.

Maybe if we tested it in the southern ozone hole region, we will find
out.

We don't know any (or 'that') much more about that scenario than we
did at nuclear bomb contemplation in the first place.  Would it difuse
the ozone to reform in a short or long reformation time?  Would it
eliminate it through some sort of adiabatic process?  Would it be more
suceptible to chain reaction?

If anyone knows the certain answers to these questions, speak up.

Gamma radiation makes ozone in great quantity.  I had to scrub
the air in my gamma sterilizer to keep ozone concentrations low
enough for a person to enter a short period of time after the
source was lowered.

No.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No.  Nothing affects the halflife of ozone except temperature,
moisture, catalysts, and target compounds (carbon double bonds
and H2S are its favorite meal).  Deflagration of ozone
(spontaneous decompostion back to oxygen) cannot be forced to
occur at a concentration of less than 10 wt% (100 - 1000 times
what is found in the tropopause).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sunlight makes more, as long as oxygen is present, and moisture
isn't.  Much of it disappears overnight, and yet we are still
here.
