As Salaamu Alaikoum,

Arrogance, Imân and Jannah
Shaykhu-l-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah
(d. 728 AH / 1328 CE)

Translated by Yahya Adel Ibrahîm

Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullah) was asked:

Regarding his statement,

“The one who possesses an iota of Kibr in his (spiritual) heart (intention, consciousness) shall not enter al-Jannah”

Is this hadîth specific only to the believers (Mu‘minîn) or (is it specific only to the) unbelievers (Kufâr)? If we were to say that it is specific for the Believers then (is not) our statement trivial considering (the fact that) the believers shall enter al-Jannah (Paradise) due to their Imân . If, on the other hand, we were to say that the hadîth is specific for the unbelievers then what is the relevance of the statement (since it is already known that the unbelievers shall not gain admission to al-Jannah)?

He (rahimahullah) answered: (Another) authentically reported wording of (this particular version of the) Hadîth is,

“The one who possesses half of mustard seed of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Jannah; and the one who possesses half of a mustard seed of Imân shall not enter the (Eternal) Fire.” [1]

Kibr that openly opposes and negates Imân results in the banishment of its possessor from entering al-Jannah as is found in His (Allâh, the Most High) statement:

“And your Lord said: "Invoke Me, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islâmic Monotheism)] (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn (Yastakbirûn – Have Kibr) My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!" Ghâfir 40:60

This is the Kibr of Iblîs (the Devil), Pharaoh and all the others who possessed Kibr that invalidated Imân . This is also the Kibr that the Jews possess and those whom Allâh has described to us by saying:

“Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some, you disbelieved and some, you killed.” Al-Baqarah 2: 87

Al-Kibr, in its entirety, openly opposes the essentials of al-Imân. As such he who has an iota of Kibr in his heart shall not act upon that which Allâh has prescribed, nor shall he abstain from that which Allâh has prohibited. Instead his Kibr shall result in his disavowal and rejection of the Haqq (Truth) and instill in him contempt of others. This, precisely, is the explanatory definition of al-Kibr provide by an-Nabi as is found in the complete version of the initial Hadîth

“The one who possesses an iota of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Jannah.”

He was (then asked), “[But] O Messenger of Allâh ! A man likes to have fine clothing and footwear. Is this included in Kibr?” He responded,

“No. Allâh is Beauty and loves Beauty. Kibr is the rejection of Truth (Battrul-Haqq) and condescension of others (wâ ‘ghâmttun-Nâs).”[2]

The statement Battarul-Haqq denotes distain and rejection of the Truth, while wâ ghâmttun-nâs implies contempt and condescension of others from amongst mankind.

Therefore the one who possesses half of a mustard seed of it (Kibr) rejects the Truth that he was ordered to accept and act upon. At the same time, the Kibr instills in him a sense of condescension that inculcates in the individual an oppressive demeanor producing transgression over the rights of others.

The one who neglects his obligations (due to his rejection of them) and is oppressive to others from amongst the creation is not to be amongst the people of Jannah (while in this state), or deserving of it. On the contrary, such an individual is to be counted amongst the people who are threatened with punishment (Ahlul Wâ‘îd)!

His statement, “The one who possesses an iota of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Jannah,” implies that the individual is not from its (Jannah) people and is not deserving of it. But if he repents, or he possesses Hasânât (righteous deeds) that expiate his sins, or Allâh has given him Ibtillâh (trials and tests) in the form of calamities that have expunged his sins, or similar things; then for that individual the recompense of Kibr – which originally was a barrier for him to enter Jannah – is eliminated and he gains admission (to the Jannah). Similarly Allâh, due to Divine Grace, may forgive the individual (the sin of) Kibr.[3] None shall gain admission (to Paradise) while possessing an iota of Kibr. As a result, those (scholars) discussing this Hadîth, and other Hadîth that have a similar theme, have stated:

“Unconditional admission (to the Jannah) – that is not in conjunction with punishment (for the sin of Kibr) – is what is being negated in this Hadîth; not the admission to Jannah that is granted to those who enter the Fire (to be purified and cleansed) and then are allowed admission to Paradise thereafter. (On the other hand) if a Hadîth explicitly declares that a particular person is in Jannah or that a particular person is from the People of Jannah, it would then be understood that he would enter the Jannah and not enter the fire (beforehand).”

After this clarification we come to understand the true meaning of these narrations as being that the one who possesses an iota of Kibr in his heart is not from the people of Paradise (up to that point) and shall not gain admission into it without punishment (for his sin). Surely he deserves punishment – due to the enormity of the sin – similar to those who perform the Major (Kabâ’ir) sins. Allâh may punish him in the Fire as long as He wishes, but none from amongst the people of Tawhîd shall remain in the Fire eternally.

This is to be the way we understand all the Hadîth that have a similar meaning. This understanding is to be used when seeking the meaning of his statement:

“The one who severs the ties of the womb shall not enter Jannah. [4]

Or,

“You shall not enter Jannah until you believe. And you shall not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something that if you do you shall (truly) love each other? Spread the greetings of Salâm amongst yourselves.”

This is the understanding that we are to have when pondering over the Hadîth that contain Wâ‘îd – Threat of Punishment. In this way we understand that the hadîth is general and can be attributed to both the Kufâr (unbelievers) and Muslims.

If one was to say, “All the Muslims enter Jannah due to their Islâm.” The response is that not all Muslims enter Jannah without punishment. Surely the people who have been Threatened (with punishment in the Hereafter due to their sins) shall enter into the Fire to remain in it for the period that Allâh so wills even though they are not Kufâr. The individual who has some Imân coinciding with major sins may enter into the Fire and exit from it as a result of the Shafâ‘ah (Intercession – permission from Allâh to intercede) of an-Nabi or by other reported means as he has articulated. He said:

“My Shafâ‘ah is for (shall benefit) the people of the Majors Sins (who did not commit Shirk) from amongst my Ummah.”[5]

And he said as is reported in the Sahîh:

“I shall bring out of the Fire the one who possesses half of a mustard seed of Imân .”[6]

In this way we understand what is in store for those whom Allâh has threatened with punishment – the murderer, fornicator/adulterer, the one who consumes intoxicants, and the one who misappropriates the wealth of the orphans, the one who witnesses falsehood and others who perform the deeds of the people of major sins. They – even if they are not unbelievers – are not deserving of the Jannah that they are promised (as Muslims) without first being (cleansed and purged through) punishment.

The Madh-hab (way and belief) of Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamâ‘ah is that the Fûsâq (deviant sinners) from amongst the general body of Muslims are not going to be eternally punished in the Fire as has been stated by al-Khawârij [7] and al-Mu‘tazilâh. [8]They are not complete in their religion (Dîn), Imân and obedience to Allâh[9]] They have Hasanât wa Sayyi’ât (good and bad deeds) that necessitate a measure of punishment and reward. This is a concise dissertation regarding the issue.

This particular hadîth can be found in the book on page 85 – Hadîth number 56. Sh. Abi ‘Abdir-Rahmân Muqbil bin Hâdî reports that the Hadîth is collected by at-Tirmithi (Vol. 4, Pg. 45) on the authority of Anas and Jâbir. He then states: “And this Hadîth is Hasan Sahîh Gharîb (Good and Authentic yet Scarce in this mode). The Hadîth is reported by Ibn Khuzaymah (Pg. 270), Ibn Hibban as is in the Mawrid (Pg. 640), and al-Hâkim (Vol. 1, Pg. 69) said – This Hadîth is Authentic and meets the requirements set by Bukhari and Muslim even though they did not narrate it.” Later on the Shaykh rahimâhullah says, “al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr said in his Tafsîr (Vol. 1, Page 487) that its chain of Narration is Sahîh and meets the requirements set by Bukhari and Muslim.” The Shaykh then takes us step by step through the Chain of narration and proves convincingly that the hadîth does not meet the requirements of Bukhari and Muslim due to the presence of Mu‘âmar reporting from Thâbit. For further detailed analysis turn to Pg. 85-88. In Shaykh al-Albâni’s Sahîh al-Jâmi‘ he declares the Hadîth Sahîh on the authority of Jâbir, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, Ka‘b bin ‘Ajrah and Anas.

[8] Translator: Al-Mu‘tazila deem the one who does not agree with their understanding of Tawhîd (7 false principles) is deemed a Mushrik. They believe that the sinners who are Muslim shall be in a place between Jannah and the Fire. There beliefs are built on false logical deductions that led them to negate many of the Names and Attributes of Allâh. They were the deviant group who opposed Imam Ahlis-Sunnah Ahmed Ibn Hanbal by falsely claiming that the Qur’ân is created and not the Speech of Allâh.

[9] Translator: The Murji’ah believe that sins, major or minor, do not effect faith and that Imân neither increases nor decreases. They claim that actions are not part of faith and that people do not vary in faith.

Forgiveness: The Mark of a Believer

by Shaykhu-l-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah
(d. 728 AH / 1328 CE)

With the Name of Allâh, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. Indeed Allâh - to whom belongs all praise - has bestowed upon me immense grace, great favours and generous blessings which necessitates immense gratitude, being firm upon obedience to Him, and becoming accustomed to having beautiful patience in that which He ordered. Indeed, a servant is ordered to have sabr (patience) in times of ease more so than in times of hardship. Allâh - the Most High - said:

"But if we let man taste the good favours after poverty and harm has touched him, he is sure to boastfully say: Harm has departed from me. Indeed he is exultant, boastful and ungrateful to Allâh, Except those who show patience and do deeds of righteousness and obedience to Allâh, for them will be forgiveness and a great reward." [Sûrah Hûd 11:10-11].

And you all know that Allâh - the Most Perfect - has blessed this affair [2] with such blessings which contain the means to aid His Religion, raise high His Word, aid His Army, and grant honour to His Awliyâ (pious and righteous servants). It is also the cause for strengthening Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamâ'ah and causing humiliation to the people of innovations and sectarianism. Likewise, it is also the cause for affirming that which has been affirmed by yourselves from the Sunnah (regarding the truth of this matter), and a cause for increasing this by opening up the avenues of guidance, victory and proofs: such that the truth becomes known to the people, who none but Allâh can enumerate. It is also a cause for the masses to begin to accept the way of the Sunnah and the Jamâ'ah; as well as countless other favours. All of this must therefore be accompanied by immense gratitude to Allâh, as well as having patience - even ii this patience is in times of ease.

And you all know that from the great principles which sum up the Religion is: Uniting the hearts, unifying the word, and reconcilination between each other, as Allâh - the Most High - said:

"So fear and obey Allâh, and reconcile the matters of differences between yourselves." [Sûrah al-Anfâl 8:10].

"And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allâh and do not split-up." [Sûrah آl-'lmrân 3:103].

"And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear proofs came to them. For those there will be a severe punishment." [Sûrah آl-'lmrân 3:105].

And other examples like this from the texts (of Revelation), which order us with the Jamâ'ah (unity upon the way of the Companions) and coming together, and prohibit splitting and differing. And the people who most exemplify this principle are Ahlul-Jamâ'ah (the people of the Jamâ'ah); just as the people who most exemplify leaving it are the people of sectarianism.

And that which sums up the Sunnah is: Obedience to the Messenger. This is why the Prophet sallAllâhu 'alayhi wa sallam said:

"Indeed Allâh is pleased with three things: That you worship Allâh alone without associating any partner along with Him; that you holdfast all together to the Rope of Allâh and not to become split-up; and that you give sincere advice to whomsoever Allâh put in charge of your affairs." [3]

And in the Sunan collections from the hadîth of Zayd ibn Thâbit and Ibn Mas'ûd - who were both great fuqahâ (Scholars of deep understanding) - who relate that the Prophet sallAllâhu 'alayhi wa sallam said:

"May Allâh enliven whosoever hears my words, memorises them and then conveys them to others. Many a carrier of knowledge does not understand it, and many a carrier of knowledge conveys it to one who has better understanding. There are three things which the heart of a Believer has no malice about: Sincerity for Allâh in one's action; sincere advice to those in authority and clinging to the Jamâ'ah." [4]

And his saying: " has no malice " means not having any contempt for them. So the heart of a Muslim does not hate these characteristics. On the contrary, it loves them and is pleased with them.

So the first thing which I shall begin with regarding this principle is what is connected to myself. So you all know - may Allâh be pleased with you all - that I do not desire any harm at all - inwardly or outwardly - for anyone from the general masses of the Muslims, let alone our colleagues and companions. Nor do I harbour any ill-feeling towards anyone of them, nor do I blame them for anything at all. Rather, to me they are deserving of nobility, love, honour and respect, over and over - each in accordance with their level. And a person cannot be except (one of three types): Someone who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; and is correct, or one who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; but errs, or a sinful person. As for the first, then he is rewarded and thanked. The second is rewarded for his ijtihâd (striving to ascertain the truth), and is forgiven and excused for his error. As for the third, then may Allâh forgive us, and him, and all the Believers.

So we should not try to dwell upon the words of those who opposed this fundamental; by saying that so and so is deficient, or so and so did not act, or so and so was the cause of harm to the Shaykh, or was the reason why all this occurred, or so and so used to speak about the plots of so and so; and other such similar statements which contain criticism of some of our colleagues and brothers. For indeed do not allow them to harm the brothers and colleagues in this manner, and there is no might, nor any power except with Allâh. [5] Rather, the likes of this criticism actually returns to the one who said it in the first place, unless he has good deeds by which Allâh will forgive him - if He wills - and indeed Allâh does forgive that which has preceded. And you also all know about the harsh treatment that was given to some of the brothers in Damascus, and that which occurs even now in Egypt. This - in reality - is not due to a deficiency or shortcoming in the brothers, nor has it occurred because we have changed our views and hate them. Rather, such people, after receiving such harsh treatment increase in the status, love and respect that we have for them. For indeed the likes of these trials are beneficial to the Believers, because Allâh corrects and improves them due to it. Since the Believer to another Believer is like each of a pair of hands, each washes the other. However, it sometimes happens that dirt cannot be removed except with a certain amount of roughness, but that brings about cleanliness and softness, for which that roughness is praised ... You (also) all know that much of what has occurred in this matter were lies, false accusations, false suspicions, and the following of false desires, the likes of which cannot be described. So all those lies and false accusations that were directed against me, are actually a source of goodness and blessing for me. Allâh - the Most High - said:

"Indeed those who brought forward the lie are a small group amongst you. However, do not think that it is an evil for you. rather, it is good for you. And every person amongst them will be paid the sin of what they earned. And as for the one who took on the leading role in this, his will be a severe punishment." [Sûrah an-Nûr 24:11].

So through such trials, Allâh manifests the light of truth and its clear proofs, which repel the falsehood and lies. So I do not desire to take revenge upon any of those who lied against me, or oppressed me, or showed enmity and hatred towards me. For indeed I forgive every Muslim, and I love only the good for them, and I desire for every Muslim the good that I desire for myself As for those who lied and did wrong, then I have excused and forgiven them. However, whatever is connected to violating the Rights of Allâh in this affair, then they should seek tawbah (repentance). So if they turn to Allâh in repentance, then Allâh will turn to them in forgiveness, otherwise the Judgement of Allâh will apply to them. So if a person were to be thanked for his evil actions, then I thank all those who were the cause for this (trial) to happen to me - for it entails all the good of this world and the Hereafter. However, Allâh is thanked for His good blessings and favours by which no affair happens to a Believer, except that there is good for him in it. And the people of good intentions are thanked for their intentions, and the people of good actions are thanked for their actions. And as for those who did evil - then we ask Allâh that He turns to them in forgiveness. And you all know that this is from my nature and character.

Likewise, you all know that Abu Bakr as-Siddîq radiAllâhu 'anhu, concerning the matter of al-lfq (the Lie against 'آishah, his daughter, and wife of the Prophet sallAllâhu 'alayhi wa sallam), about which Allâh revealed some Verses of the Qur'ân, so he swore that he would not give any more charity to Mistâh ibn Athâthah; because Mistâh was one of those who participated in the Lie. So Allâh revealed:

"And let not those amongst you who have been blessed with grace and wealth swear not to give any help or support to their relatives, or to the poor and needy, or to those who migrated in the path of Allâh. Rather, let them pardon and be forgiving. Do you not love that Allâh should forgive you? And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." [Sûrah an-Nûr 24:22].

So when this Verse was revealed, Abu Bakr radiAllâhu 'anhu said: "Rather, by Allâh! I love that Allâh should forgive me." So he continued to give to Mistâh the aid and charity that he used to give before. [6]

So with forgiveness and kind treatment towards one another, and doing Jihâd (fighting and striving) in Allâh's Path, then it is a must that:

"Allâh will bring a people whom He will love, and they will love Him; soft, humble and gentle with the Believers, stern towards the unbelievers, fighting in the path of Allâh, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allâh which He bestows upon whosoever He Wills. And Allâh suffices for the needs of His creation, the All-Knower. Indeed your Walî (protector and guardian) is Allâh, His Messenger, and the Believers; those who offer the Prayer correctly, and give Zakâh, and who bow down in obedience to Allâh. And whosoever takes Allâh, and His Messenger, and the Believers as protectors and guardians, then it is the party of Allâh who will be victorious." [Sûrah al-Mâ'idah 5:53-55].

1. Majmû' Fatâwâ (28/50-57), slightly abridged.

2. The affair being referred to is the first of Ibn Taymiyyah's unjust imprisonment - a period of one and a half years, in the year 705H - which occurred due to some lies and false accusations against him.

3. Related by Muslim (3/1340) and Ahmad (2/367).

4. Sahîh: Related by Ahmad (4/80) and Ibn Mâjah (no.230). It was authenticated by al-Albânî in as-Sahîhah (no.404).

5. This is in reference to some of their colleagues and brothers in Damascus, who weakened during this ordeal, and did not remain firm upon the correct methodology. So Ibn Taymiyyah is prohibiting any of his students and collegues from harming them in any way, and makes an excuse for them, and explains that he bears no ill-feeling or hatred in his heart towards any of them. Rather, he makes it clear that he has respect for them, and loves them for the sake of Allâh.

Al-Istighfâr (Seeking Forgiveness)
by Shaykhu-l-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah
(d. 728 AH / 1328 CE)
The Messenger of Allâh, sallAllâhu `alaihi wa sallam, said:
"The master of invocations for forgiveness is that the servant says:
'Allâhumma 'anta rabbî, lâ 'ilâha 'illâ 'anta, khalaqtanî, wa 'anâ `abduka, wa 'anâ `alâ `ahdika wa wa`dika mastata`tu, 'a`outhu bika min sharri ma sana`tu, 'abû'u laka bini`matika 'alayya, wa 'abû'u bithambî, faghfirlî fa'innahu lâ yaghfiru 'aththunûba 'illâ 'anta.

O' my 'ilâh You are my Lord, there is no 'ilâh but You. You created me, and I am your bondservant, and I will stick to my covenant and promise [of faith and sincere obedience] to You, as to my ability. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done, I acknowledge, to You, your bounties upon me, and I acknowledge, to You, my sin. Thus forgive me, for none forgives sins except You.

Whoever says this as he enters upon evening, then, dies that night, he would enter Paradise; and if one says this as he enters upon morning, then, dies that day, he would enter Paradise". [Al-Bukhâri]

The servant is always in the blessings of Allâh, which necessitate thankfulness, and in sinfulness, which requires seeking forgiveness. Both of these matters are required and essential for the servant at all times, as the servant does not cease to alternate between Allâh's (various) favors and blessings, and does not cease to be in need of repentance and seeking forgiveness.

This is why the Master of the Children of Adam, and the Leader of the Pious, Muhammad, sallAllâhu `alaihi wa sallam sought forgiveness in all circumstances. He said in an authentic hadîth reported by al-Bukhâri:

"O people, repent to your Lord, for verily I seek forgiveness from Allâh and repent to him more than seventy times in a day."

It is reported in Sahîh Muslim that he said:

"I seek forgiveness one hundred times in a day." [Muslim]

`Abdullah ibn `Umar said: We counted in a single sitting the Messenger of Allâh, sallAllâhu `alaihi wa sallam, saying one hundred times:

"Rabbi-ghfir-lî wa tub `alayya innaka anta-t-tawwabu-l-ghafûr." [My Lord, forgive me and accept my repentance, verily you are Acceptor of Repentance, Oft-Forgiving.] [Ahmad, Abu Dawûd, Ibn Mâjah]

This is why seeking forgiveness was legislated at the end of actions. Allâh the Exalted said:

"Those who seek forgiveness before dawn (at late night)." [آl `Imrân (3):17]

Some of them said: "Give life to your nights by performing Prayer, and when the time of late night comes, concern yourself with seeking forgiveness."

It is related in the Sahîh that the Prophet, sallAllâhu `alaihi wa sallam, when he finished his Prayer, he would seek forgiveness three times and say:

"Allâhumma 'antas-salamu, wa minkas-salâmu, tabârakta yâ thaljalâli wal 'ikrâmi." [O' my 'ilâh You are 'As-Salâm [One free from flaws], and from You comes Salâm [peace, or safety], blessed are Thee O' haver of glory and kindness.] [Muslim]

Allâh says:

"And seek forgiveness of Allâh. Indeed, Allâh is Forgiving and Merciful." [al-Muzammil (73):20]

(Even) After the Prophet conveyed the Message, fought in the path of Allâh with true jihad, and performed what Allâh ordered more than anyone else, Allâh commanded his Prophet (to perform istighfar), as He the Exalted said:

"When the victory of Allâh has come and the conquest, and you see the people entering into the religion of Allâh in multitudes, then exalt [Him] with praise of your Lord and ask forgiveness of Him. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance." [An-Nasr (110):1-3]

This is why the Dîn is established with Tawhîd and Istighfâr, as Allâh the Exalted said:

"Alif Lâm Ra. [This is] a Book whose verses are perfected an then presented in detail from [one who is] Wise and Acquainted. [Through a messenger, saying], "Do not worship except Allâh. Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings," and [saying], "Seek forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him, [and] He will let you enjoy a good provision." [Hûd(11):1-3]

And Allâh says:

"So take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness."[Fussilat (41):6].

And He says:

"So know [O Muhammad], that there is no deity except Allâh and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women." [Muhammad (47):19]

This is why it was it came in a narration: "The Shaytân said: People are destroyed with sins, and they destroy me with 'Lâ ilaha ill Allâh' and seeking forgiveness." [Reported by Ibn Abi Asim and Abu Ya`la, but its chain is a fabrication].

Yûnus, `alayhis salâm, said:

"There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers." [al-Anbiyâ' (21):87]

The Prophet, sallAllâhu `alaihi wa sallam, when he would ride his mount, he would praise Allâh, then say Allâhu Akbar three times, then say:

"Lâ 'ilâha 'illa 'anta subhânaka, thalamtu nafsî, faghfirlî."
[I testify that there is no 'ilah except You, Glorified are You, I have transgressed upon myself, so forgive me] [Abu Dawûd and at-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahîh]

Expiation of a gathering with which the gathering is completed is (the supplication):

"Subhânaka 'allâhumma wa bihamdika, 'ash-hadu 'an lâ 'ilâha 'illa 'anta, 'astaghfiruka wa 'atûbu 'ilayka."
[Glorified are You O' my 'ilâh and I am in Your praise, I testify that there is no 'ilah except You, I ask Your forgiveness and repent unto You.] [Abu Dawûd and At-Tirmidhî, who said it is hasansahîh]

[Majmu' al-Fatawâ 10/88-90]

Contemplation
by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Sâlih al-'Uthaymîn

(d. 1421 AH / n/a CE)

Translated by Abu Rumaysah

From 'Sharh Riyaadh as-Saaliheen' of Ibn Uthaymeen

Chapter of Contemplation [Muraaqaba]
Allaah says,

"Who sees you when you stand up (for prayer), and your movements along with those who fall prostrate." [Qur’an 26:218-219]
"He is with you wheresoever you may be." [Qur’an 57:4]

"Truly nothing is hidden from Allaah, in the earth or in the heavens." [Qur’an 3:5]

"Indeed your Lord is Ever-Watchful (over them)" [Qur’an 89:14]

"Allaah knows the fraud of the eyes and all that the breasts conceal." [Qur’an 40:19]

The verses concerning this are many and well known.

After mentioning the chapter concerning Truthfulness and the verses and ahadeeth pertaining to it, the author follows this up with the chapter concerning Contemplation. There are two aspects to contemplation:

1. That you contemplate Allaah, Azza wa Jall

2. That you know that Allaah is watching you as He says,

"And Allaah is Ever a Watcher (Raqeebaa) over all things."

As for your contemplating Allaah then this is that you know that Allaah, the Exalted, Knows your every saying, action, or belief, as He said,

"And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful – Who sees you when you stand up (for prayer) and your movements along with those who fall prostrate." [Qur’an 26:216-218]

"Who sees you as you stand" meaning at night, when the person stands in a place in seclusion from others such that no one would see him, but Allaah, Subhaanahu wa Ta’aalaa, sees Him even if he be in the darkest and most intense of darknesses.

"And your movements along with those who prostrate" meaning: and you move along with all those who prostrate to Allaah in this hour, for indeed Allaah sees a person when he stands and prostrates. Standing and prostrating have been (specifically) mention because standing in prayer is better than prostration with respect to the remembrance of Allaah, and prostration is better with respect to its appearance and condition. As for the standing being better than the prostration with respect to remembrance then this is because the legislated remembrance in the state of standing is the recitation of the Qur’aan and the Qur’aan is the noblest of speech. As for the prostration being better than the standing with respect to its appearance and condition then this is because the person in the state of prostration is closest to His Lord, Azza wa Jall, as is established from the Prophet (saws) when he said:

"The closest a person is to His Lord is when he is in prostration." [Muslim]

This is why we have been commanded to increase our supplications while in prostration.

Also from your contemplating Allaah is that you know that Allaah hears every single thing that you say as He said

"or do they think that We Hear not their secrets and private discourse? (Indeed We do) and Our Messengers are by them, to record." [Qur’an 43:80]

And along with this, that you know that every good or evil thing that you say, be it openly or secretly then it is written – for or against you. Allaah, the Blessed and Exalted says

"not a word does he utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)" [Qur’an 50:18]

Know this, and beware! Beware that their emit from your tongue a saying which will count against you on the Day of Judgement. Make sure that your tongue is continuously articulating the truth or that it remains silent as the Messenger of Allaah (saws) said

"whosoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day then let him speak only good or remain silent." [Bukhaari]

(Also from your contemplating Allaah) is that you do so with regards to your secrets and what is in your heart. Look to what is in your heart! Associating partners with Allaah, showing off, deviations, jealousy, hatred and dislike displayed towards the Muslims, love of the disbelievers and other such things that Allaah is not Pleased with. Supervise and be attentive to your heart for Allaah has said

"indeed We created man, and We know what his own self whispers to him." [Qur’an 50:16]

So contemplate Allaah in these three places, in your actions, your saying and your heart so that your contemplation may be complete. This is why, when the Prophet (saws) was asked about Ihsaan, he replied

"that you worship Allaah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then indeed He sees you."

Worship Allaah as if you see Him and witness Him with the eye, and if you do not see Him then go to the next station below this: then indeed He sees you.

So the first station is to worship Him out of hope and desire. The next is to worship Him out of fear and awe this is why he said, "and if you do not see Him, then indeed He sees you."

So it is necessary for the person to contemplate His Lord and that he know that Allaah is watching over you. Anything that you say or do or keep secret, Allaah, Exalted is He, Knows it. The author has mentioned a number of verses that prove this and began with the verse that we have already mentioned

"and put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful – Who sees you when you stand up (for prayer) and your movements along with those who fall prostrate." [Qur’an 26:216-218]

Mu’aadh bin Jabal reported from the Messenger of Allaah(SAW) that he said

"Fear Allaah wheresoever you may be, and follow up an evil deed with a good one, it will efface it (the evil deed). And deal with mankind with good manners." Reported by at-Tirmidhee and he said that it was a Hasan hadeeth.
[al-Haakim reports it in al-Mustadrak and states that it meets the conditions of Bukhaaree and Muslim. Adh-Dhahabee agreed.]

This hadeeth is one of the Forty Ahaadeeth of the author, may Allaah have mercy upon him, and in it is that the Prophet (saws) gave three great and important pieces of advice:

The First: He said, "have taqwaa of Allaah wheresoever you may be." Taqwaa means to stay away from the forbidden matters and to enact the obligatory matters – this is taqwaa! That you enact what Allaah has commanded you, sincerely for Allaah and in compliance to the Messenger of Allaah (saws), and that you leave what Allaah has forbidden due to His prohibiting it and to steer clear of it.

For example that you establish the greatest obligation that Allaah has imposed upon you after the testimony of faith – the prayer, and you establish it completely - fulfilling all of its conditions and pillars and obligations, fulfilling all of these perfectly. So whosoever leaves off any of these conditions, pillars or obligations then he has not feared Allaah (to the best of his ability), rather he has been deficient in this to the extent of what he left out.

In Zakaah, the taqwaa of Allaah lies in your calculating all of your property on which the zakaah is due, and your giving the zakaah as a means of purifying yourself without any miserliness or tightfistedness, or delay. And whosoever does not do this than he has not feared Allaah.

In fasting, the taqwaa of Allaah lies in your establishing the fast as you have been commanded, distancing yourself from idle speech, obscene words and mannerisms, boisterous behaviour, backbiting and spreading tales and other such things that would make the fast deficient and remove the spirit of fasting. The true meaning of fasting is to fast from that which Allaah, Azza wa Jall, has made forbidden.

The same applies to all of the obligations that are used to establish obedience to Allaah, and compliance to His command, sincerely for Him and in following His Messenger. Likewise all the forbidden actions are to be left in compliance to His prohibition.

The Second: "and follow up an evil deed with a good one, it will efface it (the evil deed)." Meaning that when you perform an evil action then follow it up with a good action for the good action effaces the evil. And from the good actions to be performed after the evil is that you repent to Allaah for this evil action, for indeed repentance is from the most noble and excellent of the good actions as Allaah has said

"indeed Allaah Loves those who repent and those who purify themselves." [Qur’an 2:222]

And He said

"and repent to Allaah all of you, O believers so that you may be successful." [Qur’an 24:31]

Similarly righteous actions expiate the evil actions as the Prophet (saws) said

"The five daily prayers and one Jumu’ah to the next Jumu’ah, and one Ramadaan to the next Ramadaan, is an expiation for what lies between them as long as one refrains from the major sins." [Muslim]

and he said

"one Umrah to the next is an expiation for what is between them." [Bukhaari]

Therefore the good actions efface the evil.

The Third: "and deal with mankind with good manners." The first two pieces of advice were those related to relationship with the Creator, the third relates to relationship of the creation to the creation. This being to deal with mankind with the best manners such that you will be praised and not blamed. This by having a cheerful complexion, being truthful in speech, speaking to others nicely and other such good manners.

There are a large number of texts concerning the excellence of having good manners to the extent that the Messenger (saws) said

"The most complete believer with respect to faith is the one with the best manners."

And he informed us that the most deserving of mankind to him (saws) and the closest to him in ranking on the Day of Judgement would be those with the best manners.

So noble manners, along with their being a way to beautify gatherings and the person who possesses them being beloved to the people, contain a huge reward which will bestowed upon the person on the Day of Judgement.

So preserve these three pieces of advice from the Prophet (saws) and Allaah is the Grantor of Success.

Mercy

by Shaykh Abû Bakr Jâbir al-Jaza'iry

The Muslim is merciful, for mercy is one of the traits of a Muslim, since it is the source of a pure soul and spirit. By being kind, doing righteous deeds, staying away from evil, and shunning corruption, the Muslim's soul abides in purity and his spirit remains in goodness. Since this is the case, then mercy would never separate from his heart at all. It is for this reason that the Muslim loves mercy, he spreads and encourages it and calls others to it, believing in Allah's saying:

“Then he became one of those who believed and recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and (also) recommended one another to pity and compassion. They are those on the Right Hand (i.e. the dwellers of Paradise).” (90:17-18 )

And acting according to His Messenger's saying:

"Allah is only merciful with those who show mercy to others." (Al-Bukhari)

And:

"Be merciful to those in the earth, so the One above the heavens will be merciful to you." (At-Tabarani and Al-Hakim with a Sahih chain)

And being guided by his saying:

"He who does not show mercy to others, will not be shown mercy." (Al-Bukhari)

And:

"Mercy is only removed from the miserable." (Abu Dawud and At-Tirmithi)

The Muslim actualizes the saying of the Prophet (SAW).

"The believers in their mutual love, mercy and sympathy are just like one body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body responds to it with sleeplessness and fevers." (Muslim)

Since the reality of mercy is a kindness of the heart and a compassion of the soul that leads to being forgiving and beneficent, it does not merely exist as internal kindness without external results. Rather the heart's mercy is the essence of external results whose physical reality is visible. Among the external effects of mercy are: pardoning those who slip, forgiving those who are mistaken, helping those in trouble, assisting the weak, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, tending to the sick, and consoling the grieved. All of these, as well as many other things are among the effects of mercy. The following are some real cases of examples of mercy:

1. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "We went with Allah's Messenger (SAW) to the blacksmith Abu Saif, and he was the husband of the wet nurse of Ibrahim (the son of the Prophet (SAW). Allah's Messenger (SAW) took Ibrahim and kissed him and smelled him. Later we went to Abu Saifs house and at that time Ibrahim was in his last breaths, and the eyes of Allah's Messenger (SAW), started shedding tears. 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said, 'O Allah's Messenger even you are weeping!' He said:

"O ibn 'Awf, this is mercy," Then he wept more and said:

"The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, and we will not say except what pleases our Lord, O Ibrahim! Indeed we are grieved by your separation."

Allah's Messenger (SAW) visited his younger child at the house of his wet nurse. He kissed him and smelled him. Then he returned to visit him out of compassion and kindness while he was sick and in his last breath. Then he wept, his eyes shedding tears of sorrow and grief. This behavior is an example of the manifestation of the mercy in one's heart.

Al-Bukhari reported that Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"A person was walking on his way when he became extremely thirsty. He (suddenly) found a well, he got down into it to drink from it. Upon leaving it, he saw a panting dog eating dirt for its moisture. The man thought to himself: 'This dog is extremely thirsty as I was,' So he descended into the well, filled up his leather sock with water, and holding it in his mouth, climbed up and quenched the thirst of the dog. Allah held his action in high esteem and forgave him"

The Companions asked: "Shall we be rewarded for showing kindness to the animals too?" He (SAW) said:

"A reward is given in connection for every moist liver (living creature)."

This man descended into the well, filled his leather sock with water and holding it in his teeth, climbed up, and quenched the thirst of the dog. This was done out of his affection, kindness and compassion, otherwise, he would have not undertaken such an act.

To the contrary of the above, there is a Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari that Abu Hurairah narrated from the Prophet (SAW) who said:

"A woman was punished in Hell because of a cat, which she imprisoned until it died. It was said to her, "You did not give it to eat or to drink when it was imprisoned, nor did you release it so that it might eat the vermin of the earth.")

The behavior of this woman was a manifestation of a heart enveloped by evil, devoid of mercy, and mercy is not removed but from the miserable.

Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Qatadah said that Allah's Messenger (SAW); said:

"When I enter the prayer I intend to prolong it. Then I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten it knowing the difficulty his mother will have with him crying."

The Prophet (SAW) considered the mother whose infant was crying along with the long recitation he had intended on reciting. This is another manifestation of the heart's mercy that Allah has ordered upon His servants.

2. It is reported that while Zayn Al-'Abidin 'Ali bin Al-Husayn was going to the Masjid, someone verbally abused him. His servants followed the man to beat him and punish him. However, he prevented them out of mercy for the man. He said, "O so-and-so! I am more than what you have said.

What you do not know about me is more than what you do know. If you want to know more, I will tell you." Upon hearing this, the man felt ashamed and shy. Then, Zayn Al-'Abidin took off his own cloak and gave it to him in addition to granting him a thousand dirhams.

This is an example of pardoning, and such benevolence would not occur except as a manifestation of the mercy in the heart of the grandson of Allah's Messenger (SAW).

The Most Merciful shows Mercy to those who have Mercy on Others
by Muhammad Musa Nasr

Translated by Isma'îl alarcon

The Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) once kissed Al-Hasan Ibn `Alee (i.e. his grandson) while Al-Aqra' Ibn Haabis was in his presence. So Al-Aqra' said to him: " You kiss your children. I swear by Allaah, I have ten children and I never kissed any one of them!" So the Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said: "He who doesn't show mercy (to others) will not be shown mercy (by Allaah)." Verily, mercy - in our religion - encompasses this world and the hereafter, as well as mankind, animals, birds, and the surrounding habitats.
Allaah says:

"And My mercy encompasses every thing."

Allaah has described Himself with mercy and He has also described His prophets and righteous servants with it. Allaah says:

"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) and those who are with him are severe against the disbelievers and merciful to one another."

Allaah has made his sending forth of the Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) as a mercy to all of creation, as He says:

"And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a mercy to the worlds."

The word "worlds" (`aalameen) is general and thus includes the world of the humans, the world of the jinn, the world of the animals and the world of the birds, as well as the nations found on land and the nations found on sea.

And indeed Allaah has commanded that mercy be applied to every thing and in every action. So even when you slaughter you sacrificial animal, you show mercy to it by saying Bismillaah and by sharpening your sword (so that it will be a quick and painless death). The Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said:

"Verily Allaah has prescribed Ihsaan (goodness) for everything. So when you slaughter, then slaughter in a good manner, and when you kill (in war), then kill in a good manner. And let each of you sharpen his blade and let him spare the animal he slaughters from suffering."

And Allaah indeed forgave one prostitute from the Jews who showed mercy to a dog that was dying from thirst. She filled her shoe with water and then taking hold of the dog's mouth, she gave it the water to drink. So Allaah was thankful to her for what she did and forgave her sins.

And once our Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) saw one of his Companions grab the baby of a lark, and it began screeching over the heads of the Companions. So he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said: "Who bereaved this (lark) of her child? Return her children back to her!"

The more weak and poor a human being is, the more required we are of showing mercy to him. And being gentle with him is what is most incumbent. This is why our Lord has forbidden us from oppressing the orphan. Allaah says: "Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression. And do not repel the beggar."

The Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said:

"The person that looks after and supports the widow and the needy one is like the mujaahid (one who makes Jihaad) in the Cause of Allaah."

And he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) would rub the head of the orphan and say:

"I and the guardian of an orphan will be like this in Paradise - and he SAWS gestured with his index and middle finger."

Indeed he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) commanded us to take care of the children and the women and the elders. Thus, in his last words to his Companions and his nation, he said:

"The prayer and what your right hands possess." "Take good care of the women (i.e. wives)."

And he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said:

"The best of you is the best to his wives. And I am the best amongst you with my wives."

Mercy is something innate, which Allaah has placed into the hearts of (all) His creatures, even the lions - the most dangerous of them - for they are merciful to their children. Yet Allaah is more merciful to His creation than a mother is to her child. That is why on the day that He created mercy, He created one hundred parts to it. And He left ninety-nine parts with Him, by which He will show mercy to His servants on the Day of Judgement, and sent down one single part of mercy to earth, which humans and animals share amongst themselves.

The Messenger of Allaah (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) has condemned the person that is void of any mercy and who doesn't attain a large amount of it. This is why he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) condemned the one who breaks family ties. He (sala Allahu `alihi was- Salaam) said:

"Kinship is connected to the Throne (`Arsh). It says: `Whoever severs me, then break (away from) him. And whoever maintains me, then keep connected to him."

And in one narration:

"Verily, the kinship will be connected to the Throne of the Most Merciful on the Day of Judgement. It will say: `This is the place for the one who sought refuge in You from the severing (of family ties).' So Allaah will say to it: `Will it please you that I connect those who maintained you and that I cut off those who severed you?' And it will say: `I will be pleased (with that), my Lord.'"

And he (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) condemned the oppressive leaders who do not show mercy to their people, by saying:

"The worst leaders are the cruel oppressive ones (al-hutamah)."

And Allaah has named Himself Ar-Rahmaan and Ar-Raheem, so he is the Most Merciful of this world and the Hereafter (i.e. Ar-Rahmaan) and the bestower and giver of mercy (i.e. Raheem). This is why He has commanded it in every place and in every situation. The Muslim begins his action by saying Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem so that Allaah can bless him in his action. So every action that is void of mercy, then there is no blessing in it, nor any good. And the servants of Allaah showing mercy towards one another is a cause for Allaah sending His mercy down on them.

The Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) said:

"The Most Merciful shows mercy to those who have mercy on others. Show mercy to those on earth, and the One above the heaven will show mercy to you."

O Allaah, have mercy on us above the earth and below the earth and on the Day when our deeds will be presented to us. And cause us to be merciful to one another just as the Companions of Your Prophet (sala Allahu `alihi was-Salaam) were. And have mercy on our dead ones and put those who have mercy from amongst Your servants in charge over us O Rahmaan O Raheem!

Gratitude in the Qur’ân

by Imâm Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah

Allâh tells us:

“Then remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and do not reject Me” (al-Baqarah 2:152).

And He has told us that only those who are grateful to Him truly worship Him:

“... and be grateful to Allâh, if it is Him you worship” (al-Baqarah 2:172)

Allâh has mentioned gratitude alongside îmân, and has made it clear that He gains nothing from punishing His people if they give thanks to Him and believe in Him:

“What can Allâh gain by your punishment, if you are grateful and you believe?...” (an-Nisâ’ 4:147)

In other words: if you carry out the duties for which you were created, namely gratitude and îmân, why should Allâh punish you?

Allâh has divided people into two categories, the people of gratitude (shukr) and the people of ingratitude (kufr). The thing most disliked by Him is kufr and the people of kufr, the thing most liked by Him is gratitude and the people of gratitude:

“We showed him (i.e. man) the way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his will).”(al-Insân 76:3)

According to the Qur’ân, the Prophet Sulaymân (AS) said:

“... This is by the grace of my Lord! - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is free of all needs, Supreme in honour!” (an-Naml 27: 40)

And Allâh said:

“And remember! your Lord caused to be declared (publicly): ‘If you are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you; but if you show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed’” (Ibrâhîm 14:7).

“If you reject (Allâh), truly Allâh has no need of you; but He likes not ingratitude from His slaves: if you are grateful, He is pleased with you...” (az-Zumar 39:7).

There are many âyât in the Qur’ân where Allâh makes a contrast between gratitude (shukr) and ingratitude (kufr). For example:

“Muhammad is no more than a Messenger: many were the Messengers that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will you then turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, but Allâh (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude” (Āl ‘Imrân 3:144).

The rewards of gratitude
The reward of gratitude is unlimited:

“ ...If you are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you...” (Ibrâhîm 14:7)

In contrast, other rewards and divine favours are conditional upon His will, for example, relief from poverty:

“... but if you fear poverty, soon will Allâh enrich you, if He wills...” (at-Tawbah 9:28)

answering prayers:

“Nay – on Him would you call, and if it be His Will, He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him...” (al-An‘âm 6:41).

rizq (sustenance, provision):

“... He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases” (ash-Shura 42:19).

forgiveness:

“... He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills…” (al-Fath 48:14).

Divine mercy:

“Again will Allâh, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will...” (at-Tawbah 9:27).

But Allâh has made the reward for gratitude free from any conditions, as in:

“... And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve Us with) gratitude” (Āl ‘Imrân 3:145).

“But Allâh will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude” (Āl ‘Imrân 3:144).

Iblîs and gratitude
When the enemy of Allâh realized the virtue of gratitude, he made his main aim to keep people away from it:

“‘Then will I assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: nor will You find, in most of them, gratitude (for Your mercies).’” (al-Ā‘râf 7:17)

Allâh has described the people of gratitude as being very few:

“... But few of My slaves are grateful!” (Sabâ’ 43:13).

Gratitude and ‘ibâdah
Allâh explained in the Qur’ân that the only people who truly worship Him are those who give thanks (gratitude) to Him, so those who are not among the people of gratitude are not among the people of ‘ibâdah:

“... and be grateful to Allâh, if it is Him you worship” (al-Baqarah 2:172)

He instructed His slave Mûsâ (AS) to accept what He had be­stowed upon him with gratitude:

“...O Mûsâ! I have chosen you above (other) men, by the mission I (have given you) and the words I (have spoken to you): take then the (revelation) which I give you, and be of those who give thanks.” (al-Ā‘râf 7:144)

Allâh has told us that His pleasure may be attained through gratitude:

“... If you are grateful, He is pleased with you...” (az-Zumar 39:7).

Allâh praised Ibrâhîm (AS) for being grateful for His favours:

“Ibrâhîm was indeed a model. Devoutly obedient to Allâh, (and) true in faith, and he joined not gods with Allah. He showed his gratitude for the favours of Allâh, Who chose him, and guided him to a straight way.” (an‑Nahl 16:120‑121)

Allâh mentioned that gratitude is the purpose of creation:

“It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when you knew nothing; and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affection: that you may give thanks (to Allâh).” (an-Nahl, 16:78)

“Allâh had helped you at Badr, when you were a contempt­ible little force; then fear Allâh; thus may you show your gratitude.” (Āl ‘Imrân 3:123).

As well as being the purpose of creation, gratitude was also the purpose of sending the Prophet (SAAS):

“Then remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and do not reject Me.” (al‑Baqarah 2:152).

Kindness and Generosity

by Shaykh Abû Bakr Jâbir al-Jaza'iry

Kindness and Generosity Generosity is a characteristic of the Muslim, and kindness is his disposition. The Muslim should not be miserly and stingy, for these are two reprehensible traits whose presence spoils the soul and darkens the heart. The Muslim's faith and righteous deeds purify and radiate his heart, so being stingy and miserly negates the purity of the soul, and the light of the heart. So a Muslim is not miserly or stingy. Stinginess is a disease of the heart that no human being is safe from except for the Muslim, with his faith and righteous deeds, like Zakah and prayer, by which Allah will protect him from the evil of this disease, preparing him for success in this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Almighty says:
"Verily man was created very impatient; irritable (discontented) when evil touches him. And stingy when good touches him. Except those who are devoted to prayers. Those who remain constant in their prayers; and those in whose wealth there is a recognized right. For the beggar who asks, and for the unlucky who has lost his property and wealth (and his means of living has been straitened) ." (70:19-25)

Allah the Almighty says:

"Take alms from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them ." (9:103)

Allah the Almighty says:

"And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successful." (59:9)

Since noble characteristics are acquired through different types of exercise and training, so the Muslim works to develop virtuous traits according to what the wise Shari'ah encourages and warns against. Nurturing generosity in his soul will keep his heart on the right track. Allah the Almighty says:

"And spend (in charity) of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you, and he says: 'My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while (i.e. return to the worldly life), then I should give Zakah of my wealth, and be among the righteous.' " (63:10)

Allah the Almighty says:

"As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him. And testifies to the Best. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (bliss or goodness). But he who is a greedy miser, and thinks himself self-sufficient. And belies to the Best. We will make smooth for him the path for evil. And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)? "(92:5-11).

Allah the Almighty says:

"And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah? And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth."(57:10)

Allah the Almighty says:

"And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged." (2:272)

Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"Verily Allah is Generous and loves generosity. He loves noble character and He hates disgraceful behavior." (Recorded by At-Tabarani, Al-Bayhaqi, and A!-Hakim. Az-Zayn Al-'Iraqi said its chain is Sahih, see Al-Ihya' 3:239)

Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"There should be no envy except it the case of two: A man whom Allah gives wealth, so he is able to spend it on the truth, and a man whom Allah gives wisdom so he judges and teaches with it. "(Related by al-Bukhari)

Allah's Messenger (SAW), said:

"Which of you loves the wealth of his heir more than his own wealth" The Companions said: "O Allah's Messenger! There is none of us but loves his own wealth more." He (SAW) said: "His wealth is that which he has sent forward, but that which he retains, belongs to his heir" (Al-Bukhari)

Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"Protect yourself from Hell-fire even with a piece of a date." (Al-Bukhari)

Allah's Messenger (SAW); said:

"There is no day that dawns upon the servants but two angels descend during it. One of them says, 'O Allah! Give to the person who gives (in charity)'; while the other one says, 'O Allah'. Destroy the one who withholds (charity, etc.)." (Al-Bukhari)

Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"Beware of stinginess! It was being stingy that destroyed those before you. It incited them to shed blood and make lawful what was prohibited for them." (Muslim)

Allah's Messenger (SAW) slaughtered a sheep and distributed major portions of its meat. Then he asked: "Is there anything left?" 'A'ishah replied, "Nothing, except the shank." Thereupon he (SAW) said: "All of it is left except the shank." Allah's Messenger (SAW); said:

"If a person gives in charity the value of even a date out of his honest earnings - Allah accepts only that which is pure - Allah accepts it with His Right Hand and fosters it for him, as one of you fosters the colt, till it becomes like a mountain." (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

Manifestations of Generosity
1. A person giving charity should not render it vain by reminders of his generosity or by injury.
2. The giver should be cheerful when asked and when giving.

3. He should spend without being stingy nor irresponsible.

4. Whether giving an abundance from his riches, or a small amount of one's meager means, one should give with complete satisfaction, a cheerful face and nice speech.

Examples of Generosity
1.It is narrated that Mu'awiyah sent 180,000 dirhams to 'A'ishah. She started distributing it among the people, while in the evening she told her female-servant to bring her food to break her fast. She (servant) brought her bread and olive oil. She said to her ('A'ishah): "Had you allocated one dirham out of the amount that you gave in charity today, we could have bought meat for our breakfast." She replied: "If you had reminded me, I would have done it."
2. It is narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amir purchased a house from Khalid bin 'Uqbah bin Mu'it in the market of Makkah for 70,000 dirhams. At night, he heard weeping from the household of Khalid. When he inquired about that, he learned that they were crying because of their house. He called his servant and instructed him to convey to them the message that both the house that they sold and the dirhams that he paid were theirs.

3. It is narrated that Imam Ash-Shafi'i became ill and rested in his deathbed. He had decreed by will that so-and-so should bathe his body. When he died, they called the person instructed to bathe him. When he arrived he demanded some record of Imam Ash-Shafi'i. Upon going through its contents, he found that Imam Ash-Shafi'i had a debt of 70,000 dirhams. The man decided that he himself would repay it on his behalf He said, "This is what Imam Ash-Shafi'i meant by assigning me to bathe him in his will.'”Then he left.

4. It is narrated that when Allah's Messenger (SAW) prepared for the battle against the Romans, the Muslims were facing hardships and difficulties in terms of finance and arms for war. Even the army of the Prophet (SAW) became known as "The Army of Difficulty." Thereupon, 'Uthman bin 'Affan began donating 10,000 dinars, 300 camels, including their saddles and saddle blankets, and 50 horses. From this charity, half of the army was fully equipped.

Reliance upon Allah

by Shaykh Abû Bakr Jâbir al-Jaza'iry

A Muslim does not see reliance upon Allah in his deeds as merely a necessity, rather he sees it as a religious obligation, being among the elements of the Islamic creed, since Allah the Almighty has ordered it, saying:
"And put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed." (5:23).

Allah says:

"And in Allah therefore let the believers put their trust."(64:13).

Therefore, reliance upon Allah is part of the creed of the believer in Allah the Almighty. Since the Muslim worships Allah while relying upon Him, totally submitting before Him, then he does not understand reliance as those opponents to the Muslim creed do who are ignorant about Islam. Those who treat Tawwakul as merely a statement for the tongue, giving it no place in the heart, a verbal statement without understanding its reasoning, or pondering over it, or its causes. So they abandon deeds, being satisfied and pleased with ease and comfort, under the pretext that this is the symbol of relying upon Allah. Supposedly, they think that this satisfaction is proper based on the Decree of Allah. Never! This is not the way to define and determine reliance upon Allah.

However, a Muslim understands that the reliance which is part of his faith and creed is obedience to Allah, seeking the use of all of the necessary means required for every deed and action he undertakes. He is not greedy, expecting results without using the means. Rather he should apply all causes and means in order to attain success and a response from Allah, for Allah is Capable over all things.

But for the Muslim, reliance is doing and hoping, along with tranquility of the heart and soul, with the firm belief that what Allah wills is, and what He does not will, is not, and that Allah does not neglect to reward for good deeds.

A Muslim believes Allah's law works throughout existence. He prepares the means necessary for his deeds, then he endeavors to fulfill them perfectly. He never believes that the means are itself adequate to meet his requirements and to fulfill his tasks. He does not give more consideration to the means than to the order of Allah, since it is obligatory for him to behave obediently in all cases of commands and prohibitions. As for the success of his deed and the appearance of the fruitful result of what he desired, this depends on the will and Decree of Allah. He alone is Able to do all things, whatever He wills will be and whatever He has not willed will not be. Many people attempt to do deeds but do not have success nor the opportunity to enjoy its fruitful results. Many people sow and plant, without the opportunity to enjoy eating from their harvest.

The Muslim views the means knowing that to depend solely on them is disbelief and polytheism, so he is innocent of this. He also knows that to abandon and neglect the means required to fulfill his tasks, while he is able to employ them, is a form wickedness and sin that is prohibited from which he must seek forgiveness from Allah.

The Muslim has based his view of using the means and causes for the fulfillment of his task upon the spirit of Islam and the teachings of the Prophet (SAW). As for the Messenger of Allah (SAW), personally he waged many wars. However, he never entered an engagement without preparing the proper equipment and utilizing the other means necessary for war. He would select the place and time of the engagement. For example, he would not begin a battle while in the heat until after the weather began to become cooler. In the evening when the weather was more moderate, he would arrange the troops for battle. After the preparations for battle were completed, he would raise his hands to pray to Allah:

"O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Disperser of the clouds, Defeater of the Confederates, rout our enemy and help us overpower them." (Agreed upon)

He (SAW) would use both the material and spiritual means together. Then he would put his trust in Allah for success. He would attach winning and victory to the Will of Allah and His Decree. This is one example.

Another example is when Allah's Messenger (SAW) delayed his journey of migration (Hij'rah) from Makkah to Al-Madinah, until the Divine Revelation from Allah was received. On the other hand, most of his Companions had already left for Al-Madinah unaccompanied by the Prophet (SAW). Eventually, he received the Divine Permission from Allah to begin his journey. Moreover, during his waiting period for Revelation, the Prophet (SAW) was well prepared for the long journey of Hijrah. The following are the preparations and arrangements he made:

1. The presence of an intimate friend to accompany him to the land of emigration (Al-Madinah). This close friend was Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.

2. Preparation of food and water required for the long journey. Asma', the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, prepared this provision. She did not find anything to tie them with. Therefore, she tore her waistband into two for the purpose. Hence, her nickname became "Dhat-un-Nitaqayn" (The female with the two bands).

3. Arranging a good riding camel to be used for the long adventurous journey.

4. Employment of an expert guide familiar with the geographical maps and routes to Al-Madinah.

5. The Prophet (SAW) ordered 'Ali bin Abi Talib to sleep in his bed on the night of Hijrah. This was to give the enemies who were lying in wait at his doorstep to kill him, the impression that the Prophet (SAW) was still in bed while he had already left with his close friend and companion Abu Bakr As-Siddiq on their way to Al-Madinah. They were constantlyspying on him.

6. The Prophet (SAW) and his companion Abu Bakr hid in the cave near Makkah staying there relaxed and sheltered from the pagan aggressors. By Allah's protection the Prophet (SAW) and Abu Bakr were not found by the pagans although they tracked them to the cave to kill them.

7. Abu Bakr shivered for fear for the Prophet (SAW), when he saw the feet of the pagans above them at the mouth of the cave. Abu Bakr said: "O Messenger of Allah! If one of them were to look down below his feet, he would detect us."

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"O Abu Bakr! What do you think of the two with whom Allah is the third?"

The pagans saw only a cobweb covering the entrance of the cave and a pigeon laying on her egg. They could not believe that anyone could get through without disturbing either. Therefore, they went away.

The above incident is an excellent example of the mysteries of the faith, and the ultimate reliance upon Allah. The Prophet (SAW) never neglected or misused the means for any matter, while he did not blindly depend on them.

As for self-confidence, a Muslim should not understand it as the disobedient and sinners do. Those who think that it means cutting oneself completely off from Allah, and that the servant is the creator of his own deeds, the one who determines his own achievement and profit, and that Allah has nothing to do with that affair.

A Muslim who sees the obligation of self-confidence in all endeavors and deeds understands by this that he is not to display any dependence upon other than Allah. Even though he is able to do such deeds by himself, he still puts his trust in Allah alone. If he faces any suffering or hindrance in fulfilling his task, then he immediately seeks Allah's help, not depending on any besides Him, since that would mean that his heart depended upon other than Allah which is neither desirable nor acceptable to the Muslim.

In this way the Muslim enters among the righteous, and passes upon the paths of the true believers. When one of them is finished riding his mount, he descends from it himself, he does not use the assistance of someone to help him with it. Allah's Messenger (SAW) would have the Muslims pledge to establish the prayer, give Zakah, and to not ask anyone to fulfill their need besides Allah.

Since the Muslim lives according to the creed of relying upon Allah as well as depending upon oneself, then such belief and trust in Allah must be nourished and supported by the following enlightening verses and prophetic Hadiths.

Allah the Almighty says:

"And put your trust in the Ever Living One Who dies not." (25:58).

Allah the Almighty says:

"And they said: 'Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs." (3:173).

Allah the Almighty says:

"Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)." (3:159).

Allah's Messenger (SAW) said:

"If all of you were to rely upon Allah in the manner He deserves from you, then He would certainly grant you provision as He provides it to the birds who depart hungry in the morning, and return with a full belly at dusk" (At-Tirmithi who said it is Hasan)

Upon leaving his house, Allah's Messenger (SAW) used to say:

Bismillaahi tawakkaltu 'alaallaah, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah.
"In the Name of Allah; I trust in Allah; there is no might and no power but in Allah.) (At-Tirmithi)

When Allah's Messenger (SAW) foretold of the seventy thousand people who shall enter Paradise without a reckoning, he described their qualities:

"They are those who do not seek 'Ruqyah' (incantations), practice cauterization, nor follow omens, but they put their trust in their Lord (Allah)."(Agreed upon)
