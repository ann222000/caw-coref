My summary of MDT:
http://physicsmathforums.com

D4 is expanding relative to D1-3 in a spherically symmetric manner.
The expansion is in units of the Planck length L, at speed c.
Every 3D point is always expanding into a 4D sphere with radius L.

A photon is energy caught on the surface of this quantized expansion.
The expansion of D4 occurs at speed c, so photons have speed c.
A photon is quantized momenergy orthogonal to D1-3, rotated into D4.
A photon stays frozen at one point in D4 from emission to absorption.

Expansion of D4 gives rise to nonlocality and quantum entanglement.
Two events separated in D1-3 can be simultaneous in D4.

Time emerges from D4 expanding at speed c relative to D1-3.
Time is not D4 but it inherits properties of D4.
The flow of time is tied to the emission and propagation of photons.
In clocks, the emission and propagation of photons measure time.

A photon propagates as a spherical wavefront, surfing D4.
D4 appears as a spherical wavefront as it expands through D1-3.
Measurement localizes the photon's momenergy.
This takes it out of D4 and traps it in D1-3 as a localized particle.
The entire spherical wavefront of the photon is a simultaneity
surface.

An electron continually emits and reabsorbs photons.
Its dance with photons causes its wave properties.
Photons increase the probability that its momenergy will be in D4.

Whenever a body moves it rotates into D4.
So its length appears contracted in D1-3.

The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions. Moving Dimensions Theory accounts for the aetherless
aether.

This simple postulate offers a physical model underlying and
unifiying:

RELATIVITY:

1) length contraction
2) time dilation
3) the equivalence of mass and energy
4) the constant velocity of light
5) the independence of the speed of light from the velocity of the
source

QUANTUMN MECHANICS
1) action at a distance
2) wave-particle duality
3) interference phenomena
4) EPR paradox

THERMODYNAMICS
1) Time's arrow
2) Entropy

STRING THEORY'S MANY DIMENSIONS / KALUZA/KLEIN THEORY
1) a fourth expanding dimension can be interepreted as many
dimensions, each time it expands

THE UNITY OF THE DUALITIES
1) wave/particle duality
2) time/space duality
3) energy/mass duality
4) E/B duality

GENERAL RELATIVITY
1) Gravitational redshift
2) Gravity waves
3) Gravitation attraction

THE SPACE-TIME BACKGROUND
1) quantum foam
2) the smearing of space and time at small distances
3) Hawking's imaginary time

PARADOXES
1) MDT explains away Godel's Block Universe
2) MDT unfreezes time
3) Resolves Zeno's Paradox

ONE GETS ALL OF THIS FROM A SIMPLE POSTULATE:

The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions in a sphereically symmetric manner, in units of the Planck
length, at the rate of c.

This means that every point in three dimnesional space is always
expanding into a fourth dimensional sphere with a radius of the plank
length. A photon is matter caught on the surface of this quantized
expansion, and thus energy is quantized. The expansion of the fourth
dimension occurs at the rate of c, and thus the velocity of all
photons is c.

Check out the t-shirt with a simple proof of MDT:

http://www.cafepress.com/autumnrangers.72464949

"The only way to stay stationary in the fourth dimension is to move at
the speed of light through the three spatial dimensions. Ergo the
fourth dimension is expanding at the rate of c relative to the three
spatial dimenions."

How sad it is that when truth stares modern physicists in the face,
they must close their eyes so as to get a postdoc or raise more funds
for String Theory.

Moving Dimensions Theory is in complete agreement with all
experimental tests and phenomena associated with special and general
relativity. MDT is in complete agreement with all physical phenomena
as predicted by quantum mechanics and demonstrated in extensive
experiments. The genius and novelty of MDT is that it presents a
common physical model which shows that phenomena from both relativity
and quantum mechanics derive from the same fundamental physical
reality.

Nowhere does String Theory nor Loop Quantum Gravity account for
quantum entanglement nor relativistic time dilation. MDT shows these
derive from the same underlying physical reality. Nowhere does ST nor
LQG account for wave-particle duality nor relativistic length
contraction. MDT shows these derive from the same underlying physical
reality. Nowhere does ST nor LQG account for the constant speed of
light, nor the independence of the speed of light on the velocity of
the source, nor entropy, nor time's arrow. MDT shows these derive from
the same underlying physical reality. Nowhere does String Theory nor
Loop Quantum Gravity resolve the paradox of Godel's Block Universe
which troubled Eisntein. MDT resolves this paradox.

Simply put, MDT replaces the contemporary none-theories with a
physical theory, complete with a simple postulate that unifies
formerly disparate phenomena within a simple context.

THE GENERAL POSTULATE
OF DYNAMIC DIMENSIONS THEORY
The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions.

If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.
-Albert Einstein

But after thirty years of the absurdity of String Theory, millions of
dollars from the NSF, and billions of complementary dollars from tax
and tuition and endowments spent on killing physics and indie
physicists, perhaps it's time for something that makes sense-for a
physical theory that actually accounts for a deeper reality from
which
both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, from which time, entanglement,
gravity, entropy, interference, the constant speed of light,
relativistic time dilation, length contraction, and the equivalence
of
mass and energy emerge. It's time for Moving Dimensions Theory-MDT.
-The Physicist with No Name

I know what you're thinking. Did he say there were thirty-six
dimensions or only thirty-five? Well to tell you the truth in all
this
excitement I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .45
Revolver-the most powerful hand gun in the world and would blow your
head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question--Do I feel
lucky? Well, do ya punk!? -Clint Eastwood

I'm interested in the fact that the less secure a man is, the more
likely he is to have extreme prejudice. -Clint Eastwood

Go ahead. Make my day. -Clint Eastwood

MDT IN BRIEF
Without further adieu, allow me to present the beauty and elegance of
MDT by showing both its simplicity and far-reaching ability to
account
for and answer fundamental questions. All of the below will be
elaborated on throughout the book.

Questions Addressed by MDT:

Why does light have a maximum, constant speed independent of the
source? The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three
spatial dimensions. A photon is momenergy that exists orthogonal to
the three spatial dimensions. It is carried along by the expanding
fourth dimension. So no matter how fast the source is moving when the
photon is emitted, the photon travels at the rate with which the
fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions. Thus c is always independent of the movement of the
source.

Why are light and energy quantized? The fourth dimension is expanding
in a quantized manner relative to the three spatial dimensions. Light
and energy are matter rotated completely into the fourth expanding
dimension, and as it expands in a quantized manner, light and energy
are thus quantized.

Why is the velocity of light constant in all frames? Time is an
emergent phenomena that arises because the fourth dimension is
expanding relative to the three spatial dimensions. The flow of time
is inextricably wed to the emission and propagation of photons. In
all
biological, mechanical, and electronic clocks, the emission and
propagation of photons is what determines time. The velocity of light
is always measured with respect to time, which is inextricably linked
to the velocity of light. This tautology ensures that the velocity of
light, measured relative to the velocity of light, will always be the
same.

How can photons display both wave and particle properties? The
fundamental photon propagates as a spherical wave-front, surfing the
fourth expanding dimension. This is because the fourth expanding
dimension appears as a spherical wavefront as it expands through the
three spatial dimensions. The act of measurement localizes the
photon's momenergy, taking it out of the expanding fourth dimension
and trapping it in the three stationary spatial dimensions, and it
appears as a localized particle, trapped by electrons as it blackens
a
grain on a photographic plate.

How can matter display both wave and particle properties? The
fundamental electron is abuzz with photons. Photons are continually
being emitted into the fourth expanding dimension and reabsorbed by
the electron. The continual dance with these photons gives the
electron its wave properties. Nothing moves without photons which up
the net probability that the combine momenergy will be in the
expanding fourth dimension. The more photons one adds to an object,
the greater the chance it has of existing in the expanding fourth
dimension, and thus it moves.

Why are there non-local effects in quantum mechanics? The fourth
dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial dimensions. That
means that what begins as a point in the fourth dimension is a sphere
with a 186,000 mile radius one second later. So it is that the entire
spherical wavefront of the photon exists in the exact same place in
time. Hence the non-locality observed in double slit experiments, the
EPR effect, and quantum entanglement. Take two interacting spin ½
photons and let them propagate at the speed of c in opposite
directions. They are yet at the exact same place in time! And too,
they are yet in the exact same place of the fourth expanding
dimension.

Why does time stop at the speed of light?
Time depends on the emission and propagation of photons. If no
photons
are emitted, time does not occur. This holds true whether the clock
is
an unwinding copper spring, a biological system such as a heart, or
an
oscillating quartz crystal. No photom emission=no time! As an object
approaches the speed of light, its ability to emit photons without
reabsorbing them diminishes. An object traveling at the speed of
light
cannot emit a photon.

How come a photon does not age?
A photon represents momenergy rotated entirely into the fourth
expanding dimension. A photon stays the exact same place in the
fourth
dimension, no matter how far it travels. A photon stays the exact
same
place in time, no matter how far it travels. Again, time is not the
fourth dimension, but in inherits properties of the fourth dimension.

Why are inertial mass and gravitational mass the same thing?

Why do moving bodies exhibit length contraction?
Movement is always accompanied by a shortening in length. This is
because the only way for a body to move is for it to undergo a
rotation into the forth dimension, which is expanding relative to the
three spatial dimensions. The more energy an electron has, the more
photons it possesses, and the higher probability it exists in the
expanding fourth dimension. Hence its length appears contracted as
perceived from the three spatial dimensions.

Why are mass and energy equivalent?
The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions. That means that a baseball sitting on a lab table
stationary in our three-dimensional inertial reference frame, is yet
moving at a fantastic velocity relative to the fourth dimension.
Hence
every seemingly stationary mass has a vast energy, as given by E=mc2.
In a nuclear reaction matter is rotated into the expanding fourth
dimension, appearing as high-enegry photons (gamma rays) propagating
at the same velocity of the fourth expanding dimension-c.

Why does time's arrow point in the direction it points in? The fourth
dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial dimensions.
Hence
every photon naturally expands in a spherically symmetric manner.
Hence every electron, or piece of matter that interacts with photons,
is naturally carried outward from a central point in a spherically
symmetric manner. Hence the particles in a drop of dye in a swimming
pool dissipate in a spherically symmetric manner, and are never
reunited. Hence time's arrow and entropy.

Why do photons appear as spherically-symmetric wavefronts traveling
at
a velocity c? The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three
spatial dimensions at the velocity c. Hence photons, which are tiny
packets of momenergy rotated entirely into the fourth dimension,
appear as spherically-symmetric wavefronts propagating at the
velocity
c.

Why is there a minus sign in the following metric?
x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2=s^2
The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions at the velocity c. Hence the only way to stay still in the
space-time continuum, and to achieve a 0 interval, is to move with
the
velocity of light.

What deeper reality underlies Einstein's postulates of relativity?
The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial
dimensions at the velocity c. This single postulate assures that the
speed of light is constant for all observers and that the laws of
physics are the same in all inertial frames.

What deeper reality underlies Newton's laws?
Newton's laws are an approximation of relativity and quantum
mechanics, and as MDT underlies QM &amp; relativity, it underlies
Newton's
laws.

Why is an increase in velocity always accompanied by a decrease in
length as measured by an external observer? All increases in velocity
are accompanied by rotations into the fourth dimension. All particles
can be represented by momenergy 4-vectors. The greater the momenrgy
component in the expanding fourth dimension, the greater the velocity
and speed of the particle. Rest mass is the invariant here. It never
changes. It prefers the three spatial dimensions. In order for it to
move, one must gain energy in the form of photons. These photons
prefer the fourth expanding dimension. The more photons one adds, the
greater the component of the momenergy 4-vector that appears in the
fourth expanding dimension, the more energy the particle has, the
shorter it appears, and the faster it moves.

How MDT Is Aiding Fellow Physicists

"The conclusions from Bell's theorem are philosophically startling;
either one must totally abandon the realistic philosophy of most
working scientists or dramatically revise our concept of space-time."
-
Abner Shimony and John Clauser

Moving Dimensions Theory provides this new concept of space-time. The
vast ambitions of most tenure-track physicists, including string
theorists and LQG hypers, causes them to focus on irrelevant, minute
questions, and thus, though funded by millions for over thirty years,
have not yet been able to string the bow. Deeper, true physicists,
such as Abner Shimony and John Clauser are alert to the fact that
physics need news ideas.
The expanding fourth dimension gives rise to non-local phenomena and
quantum entanglement, as the expanding fourth dimension means that
two
events separated in the three spatial dimensions can yet appear to be
at the exact same place in the fourth dimension. MDT thus provides
the
new concept of space-time.

"For me, then, this is the real problem with quantum theory: the
apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation and
fundamental relativity. It may be that a real synthesis of quantum
and
relativity theories requires not just technical developments but
radical conceptual renewal." -John Bell

"Entanglement is not one but rather the characteristic trait of
quantum mechanics." -Erwin Schrodinger
