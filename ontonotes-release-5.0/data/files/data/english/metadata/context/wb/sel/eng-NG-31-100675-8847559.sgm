To those aspiring stand up comedians, I blogged about how stand up
comedy is so hard. It'd be cool if you read my blog and left a
comment..

Even if standup comedy is hard, I'm sick of hearing comics talk
about it, like it's some kind of badge for doing something tough.  How
about trying to fight your way out of a circle of men armed with
clubs, isn't that tough enough?  Ok, so standup is tough, so what?
Wha'dya, want a medal or something?

was what they guy just did?)

Yeah man, stop with the stand up and stick with the blog.  It's all
about being heard.  Nobody is listening so why wait in line?

Couldn't handle it.  I've been on stage many times.  I have very
good stage presence, and that's a fact.  But just going over 10
minutes seemed a chore to me.  And doing the same act twice in the
same week bothered me, let alone doing it twice in the same night.
I'm not putting down standup comics, labrat, so let's not get
defensive.  I'm admitting I could never take the grind.  But mainly I
don't care for the act.  No matter how good it is, it's still an act.
More power to those who can hone their act to the point where it looks
natural to the casual fan.  Sure, standup is difficult.  So are a lot
of things.  Even taking a decent shit is difficult sometimes.  I'm not
kidding, labrat - I used to do my act and wouldn't want to do it again
for a week or more, even though the people thought it was funny.  It
just seemed too much of an act to me.  So in that regard I suppose
standup is difficult, like a stage actor reading the same lines every
night for years, but altering them slightly each time for personal
satisfaction.  I love humor and also watching good standups, many of
whom are totally unknown.  But many of the known comics who are highly
respected and talked about don't make me laugh at all, not even
close.  So why should I care if what they do is &quot;hard&quot;?  They're doing
it in the hopes of landing a sitcom or movie so they won't have to do
it anymore.  It's kind of disgusting.  Good luck in your career
though.

Actually, I was referring to burger flippers that work 60 hours a
week...

I do an act in a wheelchair.  I come out in a wheelchair and do 45
minutes of self debasing cripple jokes.  People laugh cause it is ok
to laugh WITH a cripple.   Then when I am done I stand up and walk
off.  Usually to boos.

You should do the same thing, but make fun of heterosexuals, then blow
a guy at the end of the act...
