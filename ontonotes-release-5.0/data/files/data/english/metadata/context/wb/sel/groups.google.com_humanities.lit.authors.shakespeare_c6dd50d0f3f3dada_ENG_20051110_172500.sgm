King Henry VI, Part ii Act 1, Scene 1

GLOUCESTER: [Reads] 'Imprimis, it is agreed between the
French king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of
Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that
the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
daughter unto Reignier King of *NAPLES*, Sicilia and
Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the
thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
and delivered to the king her father'--

Act 5, Scene 1

YORK: O blood-besotted Neapolitan,
Outcast of *NAPLES*, England's bloody scourge!
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those
That for my surety will refuse the boys!
------------------------------------------------------
King Henry VI, Part iii Act 1, Scene 4

YORK: To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of *NAPLES*,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.

Act 2, Scene 2

RICHARD: Iron of *NAPLES* hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,--
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
------------------------------------------------------
King Henry VI, Part i Act 5, Scene 3

MARGARET: Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
The King of *NAPLES*, whosoe'er thou art.

SUFFOLK: For though her father be the King of *NAPLES*,
Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
And our nobility will scorn the match.

Act 5, Scene 4

JOAN LA PUCELLE: 'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke
I named, But Reignier, king of *NAPLES*, that prevail'd.

Act 5, Scene 5

SUFFOLK: Yes, lord, her father is a king,
The King of *NAPLES* and Jerusalem;
------------------------------------------------------
The Tempest Act 1, Scene 2

PROSPERO: So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of *NAPLES*
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his *CORONET* to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

PROSPERO: Now the condition.
The King of *NAPLES*, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;

ARIEL: Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for *NAPLES*,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO: What wert thou, if the King of *NAPLES* heard thee?

FERDINAND A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of *NAPLES*. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am *NAPLES*,
Who with mine eyes, nEVER since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

FERDINAND O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth,
I'll make you The queen of *NAPLES*.

Act 2, Scene 1

ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had nEVER
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of *NAPLES* and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

SEBASTIAN: We have lost your son,
I fear, for EVER: Milan and *NAPLES* have
More *WIDOWS* in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.

ANTONIO: Who's the next heir of *NAPLES*?

ANTONIO: She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from *NAPLES*
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.

SEBASTIAN: What stuff is this! how say you?
'TIS TRUE, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of *NAPLES*; 'twixt which regions
There is some space.

ANTONIO: A space whose EVERy cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to *NAPLES*? Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule *NAPLES*
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?

SEBASTIAN: Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by *NAPLES*. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.

Act 2, Scene 2

STEPHANO: This is some monster of the *ISLE* with four legs,
who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to *NAPLES* with him, he's a
present for any emperor that EVER trod on neat's leather.

Act 3, Scene 3

GONZALO: If in *NAPLES*
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders--
For, certes, these are people of the island--
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.

Act 5, Scene 1

ALONSO: A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in *NAPLES*,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

GONZALO: Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
Should become kings of *NAPLES*? O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
In a poor *ISLE* and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.

PROSPERO: Sir, I invite your highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away; the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this *ISLE*: and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship and so to *NAPLES*,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
EVERy third thought shall be my grave.

Epilogue, Scene 1

PROSPERO: Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
And what strength I have's mine own,
Which is most faint: now, 'TIS TRUE,
I must be here confined by you,
Or sent to *NAPLES*. Let me not,
Since I have my dukedom got
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
In this bare island by your spell;
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands:
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. Now I want
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
Let your indulgence set me free.

&lt;&lt;The definitive transformation of the *islet of ISCHIA* Minor into
a fortress with the Castle belongs to the end of 15th century and it
was done by the King AL(ph)ONSO of Aragona,
after he conquered *NAPLES*,.

AL(ph)ONSO of Aragona made also build the entrance tunnel to the
town &amp; the wood bridge which joined it to the island of *ISCHIA*
On the entrance of the bridge a small village of fishermen rouse,
called Borgo di Celsa because of
the *MULBERRY TREES* growing there.&gt;&gt;

PANTHINO:

With other gentlemen of good esteem,
Are journeying to salute the emperor
And to commend their sERVicE to HIS WILL.

&lt;&lt;Vittoria Colonna, the Castle of *ISCHIA* and the culture of courts.
After the premature loss of her husband, Vittoria divided her time
between her palace in Rome and the beloved castle on the island
of *ISCHIA* , surrounding herself with scholars and artists;
her literary début, her encounter with Pietro Bembo
and the first steps of the religious journey that will
profoundly affect her later life date from this period.

'Vittoria Colonna and Mary Magdalen' (Barbara Agosti) deals with
Vittoria's wish to collect images of Mary Magdalen and with the
paintings of this subject she requested from Titian &amp; Michelangelo.
Michelangelo eventually executed a cartoon for a Noli Me Tangere&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Castello Aragonese is easily the most impressive historical
monument in *ISCHIA*. It stands on a volcanic rock connected to the
island by a bridge built in 1438 by Alfonso of Aragon. The Castle,
overlooking the vast horizon of the sea, was originally built as a
castrum in 474 BC by Gerone of Siracusa and, after a long period of
abandonment, reached its golden period during the fourteenth century.
Under the Aragonese dynasty, it became a political, cultural and
spiritual centre of notable interest. The Renaissance court of the
noble poet Vittoria Colonna, saw the peak of the castle's splendour.
Her court raised the Castello to heights of unheard glory: it breathed
new life into the place; the arts and sciences flourished as never
before under these skies - even Michelangelo was enticed here
- but the decline had already begun in the 15th century
and continued for more than 100 years.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The definitive transformation of the islet of *ISCHIA* Minor into a
fortress with the Castle belongs to the end of 15th century and it was
done by the King AL(ph)ONSO of Aragona, after he conquered Naples.
*ISCHIA* enjoyed the Aragonese party since from the Sicilian Vespers
and lived periods of variable fortune during the wars against the
Angenvins. For that reason AL(ph)ONSO chose *ISCHIA* as preferential
residence (except the main quarter in Naples) also for his Renaissance
Court: during the whole Aragonese reign the Castle of *ISCHIA* lived in
splendour as an aggregation point for noblemen, artists and poets.
Inside the town walls they were built several noble palaces and
churches.

AL(ph)ONSO of Aragona made also build the entrance tunnel to the town
and the wood bridge which joined it to the island of *ISCHIA*. On the
entrance of the bridge a small village of fishermen rouse, called
Borgo di Celsa because of the *MULBERRY TREES* growing there. During
the 18th century the noble families living in the fortress left their
palaces inside the Castle and came down to the village, building new
houses along the main streets going inland, so the old and simple
seafaring village grew up to becoming a small town. Also the small
medieval chapels were transformed into elegant baroque churches. Among
them we cite the Church of the Augustinians, which became the new
cathedral when the Bishop left the previous one inside the Castle.

Inside the old town walls you can visit: the former Cathedral of the
Assumption built in the 13th century, where they celebrated in 1509
the magnificient marriage between Ferrante of Aragona and Vittoria
Colonna; inside its crypt there are some frescos of Giotto's scholars.
The convent of Santa Chiara's nuns belonging to the 16th century, with
the cloister and the cemetery. The Church of St.Peters built in the
16th century, with its characteristic hexagonal plan. The Church of
the Immaculate Conception of the 18th century, with its imposing dome
which overhangs the Castle and its panoramic balconies. The Church of
Our Lady of Graces of the 16th century. And finally the panoramic
terrace with olive trees facing the South and looking at the easterly
side of the island.

In the cove sheltered by the bridge there are the remains of ancient
settlement by the Romans, who called the island Aenaria, from Latin
aenum, which means bronze, with reference to the metallurgical
activities introduced by the Greeks. Despite of the plenty of thermal
waters, the island of *ISCHIA* was not interested by the construction
of Roman maritime villas, so numerous in the rest of Gulf of Naples,
because in the classic age there were many earthquakes and eruptions
which made *ISCHIA* a place not safe and caused also the decline of the
Greek colony. To that reason it seems also it had to be referred the
choice of the emperor Augustus, who transfered the property of *ISCHIA*
to the city of Naples in exchange for the smaller and poorer island of
Capri, transformed into personal residence for himself and his heir
Tiberius.

Going on southwards, in the same bay we find the Scogli di Santa'Anna
(St.Anna's Rocks) so called because on the coast nearby there is the
Church of Sant'Anna, much loved and venerated as protectress of
parturients. For her festivity in July the sailors and the fishermen
once formed a procession of boats decorated and lightened, coming from
the village and going to the rocks, where they went ashore with all
the necessaries for the banquet with barbecue fish and white wine of
the island. Over the St.Anna's Rocks it looks also the Torre del
Guevara (Guevara's Tower), a fortified residence by a Spanish noble
family, also called Michelangelo's Tower, because by tradition the
sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti lived here during his stay.&gt;&gt;

SAINT ANNE-Mother of the Blessed Virgin Feast: July 26

&lt;&lt;Of St. Anne we have no certain knowledge. She is not mentioned in
the New Testament, and we must depend on apocryphal literature,
chiefly the Protoevangelium of James, which dates back only to the
second century. In this document we are told that Anne, wife of
Joachim, was advanced in years and that her prayers for a child had
not been answered. Once as she prayed beneath a laurel tree near her
home in Galilee, an angel appeared and said to her, &quot;Anne, the Lord
hath heard thy prayer and thou shalt conceive and bring forth, and thy
seed shall be spoken of in all the world.&quot; Anne replied, &quot;As the Lord
my God liveth, if I beget either male or female, I will bring it as a
gift to the Lord my God; and it shall minister to Him in holy things
all the days of its life &quot; And thus Anne became the mother of the
Blessed Virgin Mary.

The devotion of St. Anne was known in the East in the fifth century,
but it was not diffused in the West until the thirteenth. A shrine at
Douai, in northern France, was one of the early centers of the
devotion. In 1382 her feast was extended to the whole Western Church,
and she became very popular, especially in France. Her two most famous
shrines are at St. Anne d'Auray in Brittany and at St. Anne-de Beaupre
in the province of Quebec. She is patroness of housewives, women in
labor, cabinet-makers, and miners. Her emblem is a door. St. Anne has
been frequently represented in art, and the lovely face depicted by
Leonardo da Vinci comes first to mind in this connection. The name
Anne derives from the Hebrew Hannah, meaning &quot;grace.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&gt;From &quot;Southern Italy &amp; Sicily&quot; By Karl Baedeker Leipzig: 1928

"/>

*ISCHIA*, the Pithecussa of the Greeks, the Aenaria of the Romans, and
the Iscla of the 9th cent., the largest island near Naples. The entire
island may be regarded as the debris of a submarine volcano, the
centre part of whose crater was near Fontana. In consequence of an
eruption of Monte Epmeo the island was deserted about 470 B.C. by the
Syracusan garrison left on the island by Hiero, and a similar eruption
in the 8th cent. B.C. probably caused the Chalcidians, after a brief
sojourn at *ISCHIA*, to remove to Cumae. Eruptions took place also in
300 and 92 B.C., and in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cent. Of our era.
According to the ancient poets the giant Typhoeus, transfixed by the
thunderbolt of Jupiter, lay buried beneath this mountain, like
Enceladus under Etna, periodically groaning and causing fearful
eruptions of fire. The last eruption took place in 1302, when a stream
of lava descended to the sea on the N.D., near the town of *ISCHIA*.

After the fall of Rome *ISCHIA* suffered many attacks and devastations
at the hands of the different lords of Italy, especially the Saracens
in 813 and 847, the Pisans in 1135, and the emperors Henry VI. And
Frederick II. It revolted with Sicily against the Anjou dynasty, but
it was again subdued by Naples in 1299, and was thenceforward
permanently united with it. The Marchese di Pescara, the celebrated
general, was born in 1490 at the castle of *ISCHIA*, which was
afterwards gallantly defended by his sister Constance against Louis
XII. Of France. In 1525 Pescara's widow, Vittoria Colonna, celebrated
alike for her talent and beauty, the poetical friend of Michelangelo,
retired to *ISCHIA* to mourn her husband's loss. So, too, did
Maria of Aragon in 1548, widow of the Marchese del Vasto.

The castle, now in a half-ruined condition, was built
by AL(ph)ONSO I Of Aragon about 1450, and was afterwards
the residence of Vittoria Colonna .
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vittoria Colonna (1492-1547), From Wikipedia

&lt;&lt;Vittoria Colonna, marchioness of Pescara, Italian poet, daughter
of Fabrizio Colonna, grand constable of the kingdom of Naples,
and of Anna da Montefeltro, was born at Marino, a fief
of the Colonna family in the Alban Hills near Rome.

Betrothed when four years old at the instance of Ferdinand, king of
Naples, to Fernando de Avalos, son of the marquis of Pescara, she
received the highest education and gave early proof of a love of
letters. Her hand was sought by many suitors, including the dukes
of Savoy and Braganza, but at nineteen, by her own ardent desire,
she was married to de Avalos on the island of *ISCHIA*.

There the couple resided until 1511, when her husband offered his
sword to the League against the French. He was taken prisoner at the
battle of Ravenna (1512) and conveyed to France. During the months of
detention and the long years of campaigning which followed, Vittoria
and Ferrante corresponded in the most passionate terms both in prose
and verse. They saw each other but seldom, for Ferrante was one of
the most active and brilliant captains of Charles V; but Vittoria's
influence was sufficient to keep him from joining the projected league
against the emperor after the battle of Pavia (1525), and to make him
refuse the crown of Naples offered to him as the price of his treason.

In the month of November of the same year he died of his wounds at
Milan. Vittoria, who was hastening to tend him, received the news of
his death at Viterbo; she halted and turned off to Rome, and after a
brief stay departed for *ISCHIA*, where she remained for several years.
She refused several suitors, and began to produce those Rime
spirituali which form so distinct a feature in her works. In 1529
she returned to Rome, and spent the next few years between that city,
Orvieto, *ISCHIA* and other places. In 1537 we find her at Ferrara,
where she made many friends and helped to establish a Capuchin
monastery at the instance of the reforming monk Bernardino Ochino,
who afterwards became a Protestant.

In 1539 she was back in Rome, where, besides winning the esteem of
Cardinals Reginald Pole and Contarini, she became the object of a
passionate friendship on the part of Michelangelo, then in his
sixty-fourth year. The great artist addressed some of his finest
sonnets to her, made drawings for her, and spent long hours in her
society. Her removal to Orvieto and Viterbo in 1541, on the occasion
of her brother Ascanio Colonna's revolt against Paul III, produced no
change in their relations, and they continued to visit and correspond
as before. She returned to Rome in 1544, staying as usual at the
convent of San Silvestro, and died there on February 25 1547.

Cardinal Bembo, Luigi Alamanni and Baldassare Castiglione were among
her literary friends. She was also on intimate terms with many of the
Italian Protestants, such as Pietro Camesecchi, Juan de Valdés and
Ochino, but she died before the church crisis in Italy became acute,
and, although she was an advocate of religious reform, there is no
reason to believe that she herself became a Protestant.

Her life was a beautiful one, and goes far to counteract the
impression of the universal corruption of the Italian Renaissance
conveyed by such careers as those of the Borgia. Her amatory and
elegiac poems, which are the fruits of a sympathetic and dainty
imitative gift rather than of any strong original talent, were printed
at Parma in 1538; a third edition, containing sixteen of her Rime
Spirituali, in which religious themes are treated in Italian, was
published at Florence soon afterwards; and a fourth, including a still
larger proportion of the pious element, was issued at Venice in 1544.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;'Vittoria Colonna e Michelangelo' (Vittoria Romani) is dedicated to
the intense friendship that developed between the poetess and the
artist, resulting in masterpieces such as the Boston Pietà and Christ
and the Woman from Samaria. In this section two studies from the
Louvre introduce the visitor to the British Museum drawing of the
Crucifixion, the genesis and development of which is documented in
several letters exchanged between Michelangelo and Vittoria.
This work belongs to one of the most tormented phases of the
artist's life, when the comfort he took in Vittoria's friendship
would be abruptly cut short by her death, leaving him, in the
words of Michelangelo's biographer Ascanio Condivi,
'stunned and almost senseless' for a long time.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------­------------------------------­---

&lt;&lt;It was shortly after his appointment as architect of St. Peter's
that, in 1547, the romantic and beautiful friendship of Michelangelo
and Vittoria Colonna was brought to an end by her death, which
left Michelangelo &quot; dazed as one bereft of sense.'&gt;&gt;
