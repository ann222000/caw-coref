Well, I said at the beginning of the month that I would try
triple-posting on three different silent movie forums (or fora, if you
prefer) to see if there was an alternative to an alt.movies.silent
overrun with 400-post exchanges of repetitive crap, MI5 paranoia
postings, and that mooiee shit.

As it turns out, a rather abortive experiment as my enthusiasm quickly
waned for either of the alternatives to alt.movies.silent.  You might
call this an unfair test since I didn't stick with it, but the reasons
for not sticking with it are themselves revealing.

The one I found too frustrating to use, and I won't disagree if someone
like Frederica says I didn't give it a fair shake, was the Yahoo Groups
one here:

http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/silentfilms/

My messages were so mangled in formatting, despite the use of the
preview function, that I would be very surprised if anyone could get
through them all.  Consequently, I don't think either of the things I
posted was ever responded to.  Of course, it was also content than many
folks would have already seen here-- and I had already seen nearly
everything there at AMS as well.  So the inconveniences of Yahoo's
Web-circa-1997 approach to fostering a discussion were not in any way
made up for by cool content I hadn't already read, and I found it
impossible to convince myself to spend the time to following the same
discussions in a much less usable format.

The other one I tried to get involved with using was Golden Silents:

http://goldensilents.proboards46.com/index.cgi?

I think there are some real positive points about it.  It's people who
are fairly new to the form in many cases, lack that weariness with the
tenth Pandora's Box discussion many of us here have, exude positive
interest, and are generally friendly and welcoming-- and I can't
complain about the pleasant and interested responses I got.

At the same time... as Richard Roberts, I think, observed more
generally about moderated boards, they tend to revolve around the
proprietor and involve a certain amount of fawning.  I don't think this
is intentional here (and I've seen some boards, in the food realm for
instance, where it clearly was) but there's a definite sense there that
there's only one conversation going on, among people who've known each
other a long time.  Lacking the desire to submit short, chatty
comments, I just couldn't work up the urge to stick with it, crash the
party day after day, and eventually become a regular.  The anonymous,
nobody-owns-it nature of AMS turned out to matter more to my sense of
how I wanted to post than I quite realized.

*  *  *

So here we are, back at AMS.  The mooiee and the MI5 nutcases are still
at work; and it's Day 476 of AMS Held Hostage, the pissing match over
Chaplin misleadingly labeled with Harold Lloyd's name.  Gee, it's good
to be home!  No, not really.  It's still a bummer that the group seems
moribund in many ways and caught up in cycles of dysfunction like that.
Maybe a few folks are trying harder, but basically not much has
changed.  Is there a future for quality silent film posting here?  Is
there any chance of new blood being attracted by what we offer, or are
they finding our ground as infertile as I found the alternatives?  Hard
to see that we're any closer to answering, or solving, these quandaries.

Be patient, Mike.  I expect that we will continue to hear about MI5 for
a while, until someone calls the men in the white coats on the poor
fellow.   But as for the moo-ee morons,  classes begin tomorrow and I
expect we'll be clear of them until Easter.

Be it ever so dysfunctional Mike, there's no place like home here
at A. M. S. where many do check in from time to time even if they don't
always post or comment.  It's here that I have found many to mentor me
as well as discovering unknown facts.  This is a subject that I feel
very passionately about in a world that couldn't care less about any
film more than twenty years old, let alone a "Non-Sound" film as James
Roots recent posting aptly calls the films discussed here.
I'm going out a limb, assuming that I'm not the focus of your
frustration, or perhaps it's partly the lack of interest in items that
you may have posted lately.  Never assume that no responses mean that
no one is reading.  You may have noticed my enthusiasm for "La Terre"
that recently was on TCM.  Although there were only a total of four
different authors commenting on this (including me), I did receive some
other positive response via e-mail.  We all have different likes, and I
love a well told story.  Bruce Calvert's informational posting are
always welcome and sometimes a complete surprise to me about something
that's happening in my area.
Silent film fans are indeed a strange mix of people.  I know of
only two in my area that communicate sporadically with me concerning
"Silents," one has become a friend of both my wife and myself, while
the other has declined my many invitations to do something jointly.
I'm pretty sure that we actually sat near each other once in Ann Arbor
watching Hitchcock's "Blackmail" but like the old "Evangeline," we have
never met in spite of years of infrequent correspondence.
Those obnoxious postings and saturation of unwanted postings from
time to time is the price we pay for a public forum.  The secret is to
skip through them and not let them bother you because they are
everywhere.  Right now, that's all that exists at the Hitchcock site.

Me, I can't wait to see what's on the 140 minute Elmo Lincoln video
that I just ordered?

Still, it's going to have to wait until February when I return from
Hawaii,

Yep, and until the Chaplinassholes figure out that they obviously care
more about themselves (something they are definitely alone on ) than
actually propagating any knowledge or wisdom about silent films and
stop their destructive (and extremely boring) backbiting crap and
return to the alt.movies.chaplin group where they belong and can be
ignored, they will continue to do damage to this group.

Or could we all chip in and buy them lives?

I doubt it, they'd still keep coming here to play out their petty quarrels.

I read the Yahoo silents group for a long while, ages ago, but it
had nearly as many pedantic blowhards as a.m.s., and fewer people who
were knowledgeable enough to learn anything from. Golden Silents is for
people who are still wondering the name of that guy with the glasses
who tried climbing that big building, but at least it's friendlier than
the other forums.

A.m.s. is still the place to be. The occasional nutjob like the
MI5 guy doesn't bother me, and I bet we'd be rid of the "mooiee" people
if we e-mailed them each time their posts appear, asking them not to
cross-post to the silents group.

What's killing this newsgroup is the gasbag factor. Certain
people's inclination to harangue, declaim and debate has nearly
destroyed the sense of community that this group once had. Newbies and
knowledgeable people alike have drifted away. It's driven *me* away
(for the most part), and a number of former contributors I know.

Unless a moderated version of a.m.s. appears, the only solution is
for everyone to completely ignore the gasbags. Otherwise, we can put
this newsgroup in the ground right now. Its grave has already been dug.

In your desire to stay out of the "pissing matches" I think you are
misreading what turns these threads bad.  I posted a long and thoughtful
piece about Harold Lloyd, which led to an extended, civil and fruitful
discussion of Lloyd's work.  Tom Moran's first contribution to this
thread was a gratuitous personal insult aimed at myself and George
Shelps, who wasn't even in the thread, questioning our motives for
liking Harold Lloyd.  Connie and David took the occasion to attack some
of my earlier expressed opinions about Chaplin, in order to get the
subject back to the Great One.

The Chaplinistas will do anything to suppress, degrade or divert
discourse which tends to praise one of Chaplin's rivals or criticize
Chaplin.

I think it's important to call them to account for this, because I think
silence on the subject tends to discourage more sensitive posters from
engaging in the conversation here.  Moran knows that many people don't
care to be insulted in a public forum and his willingness to engage in
personal insult is his rather pathetic way of having an influence here
beyond the influence he could have as a result of thoughtful and civil
contributions to the group.

By the same token, anyone who wants to post an unconventional negative
view of Chaplin's work, or even to compare it unfavorably to the work of
one of his rivals, knows he or she will be immediately assailed by three
or four mean-spirited people willing to question not just their views
but their motives and their intelligence, and to engage in personal
insult as a last (or in the case of Moran a first) resort.

As long as the group tolerates this behavior, either by silence or by
lumping the Chaplinistas and their critics in the same category, the
conversation here will be less than it could and should be.

Things seem to be looking up.  The latest page of this group on Google
Groups shows all relevant posts, I believe.  And they say the group is
back to being "high activity" where it had said "medium activity" one
time I checked recently.  Keep it up.  If we see a topic that is spam
or that we don't care for, we can always post our own.

I'm not discussing the gasbag factor -- by which I assume you mean
extended discussions that don't interest you.  There are plenty of
subjects discussed here that don't interest me and plenty of opinions
that I find less than illuminating . . . but that's always going to be
the case with a public newsgroup.  In fact, it's a sign of health,
showing that the group welcomes, or at least tolerates, diverse
contributors with differing perspectives on a particular subject.  The
only alternative is a group that is the preserve of a narrow clique
which only wants to talk with like-minded people -- and for that, a
moderated group is the best solution.

What I'm talking about is the mode of discourse, whether it's civil or
not, open-minded ot not, welcoming of unconventional views or not.  It's
easy enough to skip threads that don't interest you, but I rarely do,
because I like coming in contact with perspectives on silent film that
differ from my own.  I don't resent any posts except the deliberately
rude ones and I think all opinions are worthy of a hearing

I was there today, it says the Chaplin group has "Low Activity" I suppose
the Chaplinistas have driven everyone away, and have expanded their area of

Not being a Chaplinista I can't say, but I think this reeks of
hyperbole.

There is no doubt whatever that Shelps praises Harold Lloyd and Walter
Lundin as a means of attacking Chaplin and Rollie Totheroth with the
express purpose of getting David Totheroh's goat.

I don't know what's more pathetic -- the fact that Shelps invariably
does it, or the fact that it invariably works.

Now I'm hurt (he says, pouting).

You're full of crap, Lloyd.  The fact is that you don't like the fact
that I actually call you on your bullshit.  I can understand that this

Demonstrably untrue, at least in my case.  A quick glance at my posting
record on Chaplin will show that I hold him in somewhat less than hero
worship -- just Google my e-mail address and the words "chump" and

False in both instances.

After looking at the Lloyd
Collection, I don't know how you can't
conclude that Walter Lundin was a superb
DP and Rollie was not.

And I always placed Chaplin at the
zenith (despite the slumgullion nature
of some of his adherents), but the
Lloyd Collection tilted me slightly
to Lloyd.

You are a Chaplinista, and a gasbag as well.And you and your good
friends  and fellow gasbags Shelps, Totheroh, and Fonvielle have
hyperbolized youselves and any group you infest into oblivion.

Do any of you really think any of us care, or your opinions mean
anything to us?

You obviously don't care about anyone's opinions but your own.You
obviously care nothing about what happens to this newsgroup. You
obviously don't care about preserving silent film, Chaplin, or any of
the things you gasbag endlessly about here. You merely like the sound
of your own voice, and enjoy abusing your friends Shelps, Totheroh, and
Fonvielle. And the rest of us find it extremely boring.

Do you see any masses of posters here rushing to your defense?

Simply put, you'll just have to get a newsreader that isn't Google.
Something that allows you to killfile.  AMS/Usenet isn't going to
change, you'll have to change to adapt to Usenet.  Complaining that you
don't like what certain people post isn't going to do any good.  They're
not going to stop posting and no ISP will punish a user for "breaking

Probably a good idea.  I still feel somewhat responsible for Gaza and
his stupid "mooie" posts; I'd mentioned AMS on rampf a while back, and
long story short, Gaza thought crossposting his tripe here would be a
splendid idea.
Gaza won't go away, he's been on the movie groups pulling this crap
for years.  But those who follow up to him might be dissuaded by emails
asking them to stop crossposting.

I actually enjoy reading the posts of all of the Quarrelsome
Quintet ... on other subjects.  Each of them is intelligent,
educated, erudite, and shows considerable effort to think
things through.

It's just unfortunate that they love baiting each other,
none of them is capable of resisting said bait, and every
one of them absolutely, positively, unequivocally MUST
have the last word.

If they would each just make a reasonable attempt to
exercise some self-discipline -- just enough to pick
only live bait and not dead worms, and just enough to
gracefully allow others to have the last word -- then
we could all appreciate their contributions to this
forum much more easily.

BTW, thanks to Mike for his efforts to explore the
alternative universes out there.

Lloyd, you don't help matters by always responding to such
posts yourself.

If you would just let some of them go by, it would take a lot
of the momentum out of the squabbling.

The moment you responded to Tom's insult about sitting through
the credits, he posted back in an obvious attempt to escalate
it and turn it into another 476-post catfight.

Do you imagine the rest of us can't identify a gratuitous
personal insult when we read one?  You don't need to point
it out to us and thereby give Tom opportunity to post another.
Give us some credit, we know crap when we see it.

It takes two to fight.

Actually, Stacia, my concern is less how I can deal with it-- I can
ignore it easily enough and do-- than with the fact that the group is,
presently, so off-putting to newbies.  There are two ways one could
theoretically do something about that-- one, reduce the amount of crap,
which in practice proves very difficult (though I do have hope that
someday Lloyd, at least, will realize the benefits of having made your
point and walking away), and two, increase the proportion of good
posts, which we could do.  I think there's some small movement in that
direction, at least-- I admired the effort to get some discussion on La
Terre going, and someday I'll watch it and contribute (insert
embarassment icon here).

I hope you don't mind if I object here.

This last part is incorrect factually.  You claim that "none of them is
capable of resisting said bait" when the fact is that I have no
responded to a post of George Shelps for a very long time now (probably
a couple of years), in spite of all his attempts to bait me into doing
so.

So there.  Nyah. :-Þ

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> [...] and every one of them absolutely, positively, unequivocally MUST

Here you may not be on the most factual of grounds either.  There are
several threads recently on which I have not had the last word.

And when you think about it your contention makes no sense logically,
since if every one of the five of us had to have the last word, no
thread would ever end (think Zeno's Paradox).

As I've said, it's been a very long time since I've responded to the
noxious Mr. Shelps, so I would think I have led the way in this
respect.

I don't get bothered by the MI5 things, nor the 'moovie' posts,
or are 'what the best movie you've [sexual inference] too.

I have a news reader [I live in a Unix world for the most part]
where one keystroke will put all of a certain subject into a KILL
file.  For postings that come from a particular address I do have
to edit a file.  When the AMS list of unread messages came up this
morning I saw that it processed about 15 statements for
cancellation.  Perhaps looking for a better news-reader would
solve your problems.

I have found usenet to be about the best way to get news - having
used it from about 1985 when a great deal of the transport was
from government and/or univeristy sites and therefore there was
NO commercial advertising at all - and daily posts to the entire
net were under 50MB/day as opposed to the 600GB/day currently [and
that's probably outdated since that figure is several months old].

Perhaps others could suggest a better news reader for you, but
with proper filtering and perhaps a better newsreader, you'll find
the usenet news to be one of the best organized places for
information exchange.  The messages come to you - if you have
things set up properly - and you don't have to go chasing after
message boards all over the place. [I gave up running a BBS/board
back in 1985 as they started gonig downhill then, and have seemed
to have progressively gotten worse.

Maybe I'm an anachronism is the highly graphics persumably pretty
posting world, but I'm more concerned about content than how pretty
a posting looks.

There is a lot of crap and spam here, but also informative, worthwhile

I use Google, which lacks a killfile, but it's pretty easy to see what

I believe (unless we're talking about different posts) that this is
inaccurate, since I did not respond to Lloyd's response until just now
-- *after* you posted this post.

And I rather doubt that it will end up being a 476-post thread.

Although you never know...

Here's the problem.  Obviously, no one can stop a character like Tom
from posting his heckling and insulting comments on a public newsgroup,
and responding to them does give him the attention he craves.  But if
personal insults in a public forum are passed over in silence, it sends
a message that the group as a whole tolerates, perhaps even approves,
such behavior, and this discourages some people, especially, new
readers, from posting here.  It also encourages otherwise civil
contributors to use the same tactics.

Many people will accept personal abuse in a public group if they think
that the majority of posters disapprove of it but not if they think it's
acceptable behavior by the group as a whole.  I've seen groups ruined by
a few abusive posters whose behavior was tolerated in silence by the
majority.  Productive contributions by newbies dried up, new abusive
contributors were attracted to the group, and the civil veterans
gradually deserted the conversation.

Believe me, I could care less about having the last word in one of
Moran's exercises in grade-school insult -- I attack them for the
benefit of new readers and lurkers here who wonder if his behavior
reflects the mores of the group.  Perhaps it does, in which case I'll
give up on the group, but I'm not convinced of it as yet.

Moi aussi.  I did see the Russian version, EARTH, and hated

but not having seen the latter, I can't.

If anyone else wants to continue posting on this topic, they
are welcome to it.

But Lloyd and Tom, I said all I have to say about it, and
your responses have done nothing to change my opinions, so
I will not post further on it.  If you or anyone else wants
to know what I think of it, just refer back to my earlier
postings.

There, that was easy, wasn't it?

Michael,
I usually don't respond to your posts because I'm more into the factual
details of films, performers, and screenings.  My own critical thoughts are
rarely as spot-on or eloquent as your film criticisms anyway.  Your posts
are usually among the best things to read on this newsgroup.

The problem with a.m.s. is that it can be sometimes hard to separate the
meaningful messages from the pedantic ones.  If you can say to yourself that
you will just read the interesting topics and not every message posted here,
then you don't have to stress about not reading them all.

As long as our knowledgable regulars like Mike S., Bob Birchard, Richard
Roberts, Frederica, Donna Hill, Jim Reid, James Niebar, Jim Roots, Rodney
Sauer, Ken Winkor, Ed Hulse, Matt Barry, Eric Grayson, Eric Stott, William
Ferry, Annette Lloyd, Chris Snowden, Jessica Rosner, Dennis Doros and the
many others whom I've negleted to mention (apologizing in advance to those
I've left out) continue to ask and answer questions and critique films, then
this newsgroup won't die.

For example, Moran once flat-out
called me a draft dodger.  Not one
peep from the assembled throng here,
except Ed Hulse.

Lloyd, you ought to realize that Moran
is tolerated as an "id" figure in this
group, an entertaining "monster from
the id."

I understand, but I guess I consider myself a perpetual newbie, and
from this vantage point things don't seem quite so severe.
First off, people who are familiar with Usenet are going to know that
every group -- yes, *every* group -- has its trolls and pissing matches.
I doubt that will put anyone off, in and of itself.
Secondly, any newbies who arrive will be scared pantsless by all the
knowledgeable people here.  When I started posting I was blithely
unaware of who I was corresponding with, until I rented some silents and
started seeing names of people who posted here in the credits (music,
restoration, etc.)  Being completely unaware of the contributions most
people on AMS made to the world of silent films was the *only* reason I
survived!  Plenty of people from other movie groups have come here, only
to run away in fear after they make a silly mistake and get chewed out
by a Famous Author. ;) To me, I'd say fear of looking stupid is more of
a concern to newbies than any pissing matches.

I agree that more good posts is a good idea.  However, it doesn't
always work.  The trolls have taken over rampf lately and I tried
posting more content to the group, but it went almost completely
ignored.  People like the drama of a flame war more than they want to
talk about movies.
I think AMS is different, though, and to me, it's still the best and
most on-topic group I go to.  That's because plenty of people like you
care about AMS.

No, it doesn't.  Anyone familiar with Usenet will realize that someone
who makes personal attacks constantly and gets no followups is simply
killfiled.

The only time I've seen this happen in my 13-plus years on Usenet is
on rec.food.cooking, where a racist, sexist little cretin named
"Sheldon" is embraced by most regulars.  However, plenty of people speak
out against him, have him killfiled, etc.  The group continues to
function as a high-volume forum that's almost always on-topic.  Despite
the unhinged rants of one dysfunctional poster, the group is just fine.

But how are newcomers to the group supposed to deduce this?  They'll
read his personal insults, and the general acquiescence that greets
them, and think this forum is not a suitable place in which to converse
civilly about the subject of silent film.

Do you really think it's necessary to refer to someone whose posts don't
interest you as a gasbag, even if that's what you privately think?
There are bound to be many well-intentioned posts on a public forum like
this which don't interest everybody.  Why be rude about it?
