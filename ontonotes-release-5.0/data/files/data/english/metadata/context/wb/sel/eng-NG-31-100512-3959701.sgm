Can anyone tell me about the MP3 player in the Special Edition?  Does it
read burned CD's well?

I don't have any idea, but I sure the hell wouldn't buy a car because
it comes with a mp3 player. Honestly if you want the best stereo just
buy one, anyhow, stock stereos normally suck.

You want something good, buy a PIONEER DEH-P8600MP. It's $800, and you
can buy it on ebay for $319, just go to
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=39752&amp;item=578...

Item number: 5786530092

Thats what I have, and its the best. Buy it, and get a amp, and box and
your all set. It will beat any stock stereo.

spoiler for another $100 I'll be happy.

I have it and it plays MP3's on CD-R just fine.  One minor complaint is when
a song title has too many characters, the excess gets cut off.  I'd prefer
if it would scroll the entire title, but it certainly wasn't a deal-breaker.

yeah, like the other guy said it does not scroll text, and it does not have
an RCA output.

But it has played everything I've burned without issuses.

Even the after market MP3 players don't show the entire title of a
track. This is just something they haven't been able to change, but I
am sure they will in a year or so.

They change everything else.
