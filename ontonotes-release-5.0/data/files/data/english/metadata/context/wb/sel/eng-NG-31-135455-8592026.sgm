Real problem with debian user is not spam, but that posts don' t get
posted.

Every since around late June 2007, posts don't make it to
debian user list.   It used to work.

I've tried 5 email accounts and over 15 posts and I've only found
one way to post a question, an answer or reply to debian user list.

Even posts from my email account at a reputable, large ISP that I pay
$30 a month for won't post.

And it took me 2 months to find a very complicated and unusual
way to post here.  So I've found a way to post but there are probably
thousands of people who can't post to debian user at all.

My posts were about mouse not working after etch upgrade and
other upgrade problems, so why flag is as spam??

Asking to let the post through by emailing to list master doesn't
work
either!

The spam filter is set way, way too high.

The funny thing is that people are not aware since
the people who can't post, can't complain about it
on the list.  You guys need to be aware of this posting
problem.

I finally gave up and went to ubuntu forums to post and get help.

If posts don't get through, and my upgrade to etch caused
things to be broken for 2 or 3 months is just unacceptable
if there is no help to get things fixed.

Probably the only way to fix this is the way ubuntu forums work
in that spam posts can be deleted from the forum by flagging.

Unfortunately, most of the debian experts seem to read
this email list and not the web based forums for debian that I have
found.

In general, I'm thankful for the volunteers who run the list,
but if you can't post, it's worthless and we should kill this list.

By the way, if you want to get rid of spam, read the debian
user email list with gmail
and all the spam goes to a junk folder.

Can you please check if you are subscribed to
whitel ... @lists.debian.org?

The other thing that would help the listmasters is, if you could pass
the message-id to the listmasters, so we could check what actually
happens to your post. We then can try to improve our filters.

Sorry for your problems,

Martin

Not so.  I use Gmail and I have been seeing quite a bit of spam in the
last few days.

http://lists.debian.org/whitelist/

BTW, It is a pretty standard practice. But then I have been a member of
Debian lists for a long time.

I've never heard of it before either, even though I've been here on and
off for years.  On the other hand, I've never seen a problem posting, or
been aware that there was a problem.

As far as I am concerned, this is the best list around.

Never had a problem posting either and my setup is far from typical.
I've gone from a DynDNS setup ages ago on dialup, hosting my own server on
DSL, leasing two machines (one in a spam block, no less, never make that
mistake again) and now have taken to leasing a Xen VM for my mail/web needs.
The only time I've ever had a problem with the list was when it was spewing
spam at me and my server refused enough for me to be unsubscribed.

On the other hand I'm sure there are a few readers of the list over the
years who probably had hoped I would have posting problems.  ;)

This is from my home server on ADSL too -- I do get blocked by a small
minority of recipients' ISPs, but happily not by d-u.
