I'm getting my cat a cat.

The cat is being adopted from a local shelter, where they tell me he's been
staying for about two years.  They've been calling the cat &quot;Bahama,&quot; but I
don't like it, and if feasible, I'm going to call him &quot;Bob.&quot;

How feasible do you think it will be?  Cats have the reputation of not
responding when called, but my current cat knows what I call her, and if I
say her name, at least her ears twitch.

Do any of you have experience with changing a cat's shelter name after
adopting it?

I've done foster care for cats. When our rescue group takes in a
stray, we don't know it's name. The rescue group assigns a new name.
Sometimes we take one into foster care and don't feel the name fits,
so we call it something different while it's in care. When it gets
adopted it's probably called something else yet. Add to that the
number of nicknames all along the way.

They all seem to come when it's dinner time.

I think that if a cat is going to respond, it's usually responding on
the basis of your tone of voice and whether it hears the can opener.  I
constantly mutate my pets' nicknames; Serena becomes Reenie-bean,
Reenalda, Reenie-cat, Reenie-bot, Fatty-cat, or just Poosy-gato.  If she
hears the can opener she's there in a heartbeat.

I have tried to associate &quot;Here, kittykittykitty&quot; with the can opener
and food sounds, and that has actually kind of worked.  They both come
pretty readily to &quot;Here, kittykittykitty&quot;.  That means that if I have to
round them up quickly it's a little easier.

Estron,

No advice but, in my teens a friend had a cat that was called something but
they &quot;free-fed&quot; it and after awhile it got so fat they changed it's name to
&quot;Puddles&quot; 'cause whenever it laid down, it's fat spread around it like a
puddle!

Don't think it actually responded to any name.

They shouldn't have been allowed to have kids, let alone, pets!!! :(

We adopted a cat that was six months old.  Her name in the foster home
was Hannah, and it was way too goody-goody for her.  So we changed it
to Katy.  She's used to it now, and acknowledges it.  She doesn't come
when called no matter what you call her, so from that point of view it
doesn't matter.  But she knows it's her name.

I think it's likely your cat knows your voice, especially when you use the
&quot;communicating with or about ME&quot; tone to which she will pay especial
attention. We've adopted several strays over the years, a couple of which
just followed us home in the street, and they didn't have a problem
responding when called. The odds don't favour us having hit on their &quot;real&quot;
names by accident.
Besides, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES (I tell you)

I had a cat who didn't have a name that stuck for the first five years
of his life. But once his name stuck, he came to it religiously.

The current crop, neither are particularly concerned with coming when
called. No, I take it all back. I just called Puff (&quot;Nuffers!&quot;) and
she wandered over, then I called Buster, who was out of sight in the
other room, and he zoomed in.

So call your new cat what fits, and eventually he or she will figure
out what the heck you are talking about.

Of the four cats I have now, one seems to recognize when I'm checking
that she hasn't left the patio.  That's Raven, and she comes on her
name -- at least for a couple of voice tones.

Donald, Mr Beans, and Marie don't seem to care what I call them as

wanted to do something like &quot;Volcom&quot; (why name a cat after a clothing
brand?), so he's had name changes, but doesn't care.  Marie is often

There's a horse at the boarding stable called &quot;Stussy.&quot;  Quite a
departure from his barn-mates, who have sensible horse names like
Ruby, Two-Bits, Cody, Mikey, and Dakota.  He is a rather flashy red-
and-white paint, though, so perhaps he should have a fancy name.

Our orange terror, PJ, knows that's his name.  He won't come when
called unless you have a treat (and he can't be fooled...the voice
gives it away), but he knows he's PJ, Peejness, Peejocity, or
kittykittykitty.  Of course, the horse also answers to kittykittykitty
because it's easy to call across a pasture, but she isn't quite as
tuned-in and comes roaring across the hillside for the mere hope of a
treat in the pocket.

The dog is Sparkle.  I didn't name her.  She was trained to it in
prison, though, so we didn't change it.  We usually call her dogbear.  I

Cat[-2] was called &quot;Flash&quot;, since she zipped around the house.  Later I
found that was the name of Sheriff Coaltrain's dog on &quot;Dukes of
Hazzard&quot;.  Oh well.  She was an adopted stray, and IIRC never responded
to her name.

Cat[-1] was called &quot;Catherine&quot;, or &quot;Cat&quot; for short.  (Yes, that was
planned.)  I forget what she was called at the shelter, but it wasn't
that.  She came when called.  Maybe she also would have responded
favorably to any other word with the same vowel sound...

The current cat is deaf, so she responds equally poorly to any name.

I very much concur with everything everyone has said in this thread
and/or is about to say. It is that kind of thread.

Just to reinforce, you can call your cat anything you please as long as
your feed him/her and otherwise attend to your domestic duties. All the
cats I have known have responded much better to something like
puss-puss-puss, or even pssss pssss pssss than any name anyone has hung
on them. I think it's the S sound. The cat's name is about you, not
about the cat.

My experience is that cats don't know their names.  They know lots of
words for &quot;food&quot;, but that's it.

The ex-Catpins, Aldrin and Sophia (who don't have custody of me) have
never shown any knowledge of the differences in their names.  Call
one, they both come (for values of &quot;come&quot; that include &quot;run to the
fridge&quot;).  Same when I had two cats before - neither Paddy nor Nelson
ever learned their separate names, and Paddy was the most intelligent
cat I've ever known.

I made a point of studying this with Aldrin and Sophia, and have never
seen either of them respond to their names without equal response from
the other.

From when we first got them, I always used &quot;come on&quot; as an indication
that they were about to be fed.  They soon picked up on that.  This
led to a funny incident:

A friend was visiting, and it was time to feed the cats.  They were
both lying on chairs in the same room, and I started talking to them,
using their names to attract their attention.  Both were staring at me
as I said something like &quot;and if you want to eat, you'd better come on
into the kitchen&quot;.  Both leapt off their chairs and ran into the
kitchen.

My friend was amazed at their understanding of the English language.

Buster, oddly enough, seems to stick with &quot;Buster&quot; in various tones.
Cream Puff, on the other hand, is Puff, PuffEnuff, Puffers,
PufferPurrPaw, SchnoodlyKitten, Little Miss Puff'n' Stuff, FluffEnuff,
Little Puffers Full of Fluff, and so on. Once a friend called her
&quot;Creamy&quot; and we were all a little weirded out.

Also, neither of them respond to treats. When they respond to their

We trapped a feral cat many years ago and took it in to be wormed,
deflead, and neutered, with no intention of keeping him. So we told
the Veterinary office just to call it &quot;black cat&quot;, as we didn't want
to keep it. We ended up not being able to get rid of it, so we kept
it and named it &quot;Deacon&quot; [black with a white collar]. It seemed to
answer to &quot;Deacon&quot; just fine.

We seldom do that to a pet name, although there have been
exceptions.  Polka.dat [named after a computer file], for instance,
gradually metamorphosed into Poker Chip. And I am just as likely
to call our gray cat &quot;Grouchy&quot; instead of &quot;Smokey&quot;. She answers

happened to be close to me:

I don't mangle names much.  My first cat &quot;Fluffy&quot; in my childhood was
never anything else.  I( don't remember if the name was mine or she
was named by the litter owner.   The cat I had in the eighties &quot;Misty&quot;
came with that name from a co-worker.  I never called her anything
else.  (The fountain that was installed near her food dish was a
&quot;Mistyfier&quot; to me and a &quot;Misty Mister&quot; to the guy who installed it for
me.)

Wendy's cats were &quot;Larry&quot; (her siblings were &quot;Curly&quot; and &quot;Moe&quot;) and
&quot;Lucky&quot; (rescued as a newborn from INSIDE a barn wall by dismantling
the wall), and I never called them anything else.

My current cat (Birthday gift in 1991) came with the name &quot;C.J.&quot; from
the shelter.  She's &quot;Seege&quot; when she's being cute or &quot;CJ&quot; when she's
been bad, but no further variations.

So, no.  Not everyone does that.

Lie down on the floor nearby, ideally where you can make eye contact
and do the Slow Blinking Thing with him, turning your head away most

But don't push it, it will just freak him out some more. Freaked-out
cats, especially in new places, always hide under the bed or in the

Yes, you're right - don't push it.

When Marianne and I adopted Fox, our first cat together, Fox was
extremely nervous and hid under the bed.  So I lay down on the floor
near the bed, not too near, turned my back on her and napped for brief
periods.  It wasn't very comfortable, so I kept waking up.  I'd look
over at her under the bed, catch her eye, slow-blink, then close my
eyes and turn away with the stretching and quiet moaning stuff that
cats do.

Later that day, Fox was running around the house after me, purring.
Wouldn't leave me alone.  It was really cute.

sound of Bob scratching at his litter box.  The first time I roused up, and
saw in the dim light a flash of black-and-white cat scurrying back to the
closet.  The second time I tried to keep still, and the cycling of the AC
sent him running back.

Eventually I got the message: He's freaked out, but he's functional.  He
won't huddle, er, catatonic in the closet or start urinating and defecating
in there.

&gt; That's the way to earn Bob's trust.

Hell, that would earn MY trust!

Sounds good.  He'll come out eventually.

When we first got the Catpins, Sophia, always the more nervous of the
two, installed herself behind the freezer and didn't come out for
several days except to eat and use the litter tray.  I could just
reach her in there, and could see her, and from time to time I'd go
and say 'hello' - talk to her, stroke her, etc.  She'd purr, and
obviously enjoy the contact, but she wouldn't come out.

The cute thing is that Aldrin, the bolder one, would join his sister
behind the freezer, even though he was quite OK with being out and
about with the humans.  It was as if he were just keeping her company.

Scallion, one of the cats currently living here, disappeared behind
the boiler when I first let him out.  I left him alone, and later in
the day he reappeared to ask me if I needed any help with the chicken
I was cooking (oddly enough, just as the smell of it cooking began to
permeate the kitchen).  I've been his bestest friend ever since.

&gt;&gt;Besides, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES (I tell you)

&gt;Yes, but T.S. Eliot made it clear (was he the insane one, or was that Ezra
&gt;Pound?)  that those names are not within the realm of humans to bestow.
">

Oh, and I was told that he was called Simba.  It didn't take long to
realise that it wasn't right, and within a few weeks his real name
came to me.

My latest feline guest proved more of a problem, taking several months
to reveal his name, but I think Thackray has the right name now.
Diego definitely wasn't right.

It'd freak _me_ out. Especially the eye thing.

Bill &quot;and I wouldn't know how to take the stretching thing&quot;

When we brought our (now sadly deceased) black-and-white cat, Duchess,
home for the first time, we installed her carrier in the bathroom
along with her litter box, food and water.  The bathroom was a safe
and easily-cleanable place for her, and the (cat-friendly) dog could
be blocked out with a bungee cord around the door handle...the kitten
could go in and out if she wanted, and hear/see/smell the usual
household goings-on, but the dog couldn't get in to scare her.  Since
she was in the bathroom, we were able to pet and hold and talk to her
a lot, so she was fine with us, but anytime she saw the dog she ran
into her carrier and hissed a fit.

That lasted three days.  On the evening of the third day, she walked
out of the bathroom with her tail in the air, condescended to being
lovingly bathed by the dog, and owned the house for the next ten
years.

The orange terror, on the other hand, stayed in the bathroom just a
day and a half before emerging at top speed, beating up the (same)
dog, and getting repeatedly stuck about five feet up on the curtains.
He's calmed down only a little since then, but he's only three...we
still have hope.
