Dell Inspiron 6400 - creating new partition

I have a brand new Inspiron 6400.
I want to Ghost the NTFS partition.
To do this I want to Split this NTFS partition into 2. I want the new
partition to be Primary.
Problem is all 4 Primary partitions appear to be already used with
this laptop when it's brand new.
Partition Magic says there are 5 Primary partitions (obviously a
misinterpretation) and one Logical (there is an extended patition).
Acronis says there are 3 Primary partitions.
Paragon says says there are 4 Primary partitions and an Extended & a
Logic partition.
FDISK says there are only 4 partitions in total.
Ranish Partition Manager says there are 5 Primary partitions & an
Extended & Logical Partition.

I'm confused.
What's the easiest way for me to be able to Ghost the NTFS partition.

Any help would be much apprectiated.
