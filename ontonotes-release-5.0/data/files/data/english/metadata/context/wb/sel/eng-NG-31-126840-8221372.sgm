Nearly two weeks ago, in the midst of claiming executive privilege on
documents relating to the U.S. Attorney purge, the Bush White House
also told Congress that lawmakers would not be permitted to see
documents relating to former political director Sara Taylor’s work on
the matter. It was obviously disappointing (though not unexpected),
especially given the Bush gang’s rhetoric about their willingness to
cooperate.

But at least Taylor agreed to honor a subpoena and will testify to the
Senate Judiciary Committee about what she knows of the scandal, right?
Wrong. Her appearance, which was scheduled for Wednesday, is now off —
Taylor’s lawyer doesn’t think the White House is wiling to let her
talk the committee.

From the letter Taylor’s attorney delivered to Senate Judiciary
Chairman Pat Leahy:

Ms. Taylor expects to receive a letter from [White House Counsel
Fred] Fielding on behalf of the President directing her not to comply
with the Senate’s subpoena. These contrary directions undoubtedly
create a monumental clash between the executive and legislative
branches of government. This clash may ultimately be resolved by the
judicial branch. […]

Absent the direction from the White House, Ms. Taylor would
testify without hesitation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She
has participated in no wrongdoing. She will assert no personal
privileges.

[Taylor] faces two untenable choices. She can follow the
President’s direction and face the possibility of a contempt sanction
by the Senate, with enforcement through the criminal courts, an action
that regardless of the outcome, will follow her for life. Or, she can
attempt to work out an accommodation with the Senate, which will put
her at odds with the President, a person whom she admires and for whom
she has worked tirelessly for years.

Chairman Leahy responded, “The White House continues to try to have it
both ways — to block Congress from talking with witnesses and
accessing documents and other evidence while saying nothing improper
occurred.”

If I didn’t know better, I might get the impression that the White
House has something to hide.

Secret earmarks aren't something that would damn Bush, so you pay no
attention to the corruption.

But here is an explanation... earmarks are the means by which Congress
steers money to their friends and relatives.  It is graft and
corruption in many cases.  It comes to tens of billions per year.
Those open-government, transparent, anti-corruption Democrats -- you
remember, the ones who said they would clean up Congress if given a
majority -- decided that it was really too much trouble to make
earmark provisions public, so the disinfectant of sunlight could help
reduce the occurrence of graft and corruption.  I think that is just
as bad as anything the White House has tried to keep secret, and for
damn sure it is something that ought to matter in the next election.
Kick out porkmeisters like Trent Lott, Ted Stevens, John Murtha, David
Obey, and others.  That might send a message.

The sad thing is that everybody knows what they're hiding. It was a
blatant attempt to install U.S. Attorneys that would prosecute
opposition candidates right before the elections. All they're doing
now is playing games with the law, trying to get off on a
technicality. They're not actually hiding anything from anyone. Their
detractors expect this kind of criminal behavior from them and their
supporters condone it.

Even sadder, the Democrats won't do a damn thing about it even if they
do prove their case. Remember, impeachment is &quot;off the table&quot;. It's
all just showbiz for the 2008 elections.

Yep. Bush is much more valuable to them as a punching bag if they keep

Whatever the American Research Group's expertise is, it doesn't

updates about once a second in Firefox 2.0.0.4.  I can't even scroll
down, since every refresh pulls me back to the top.  I hope these guys
are better pollsters than they are communicators.

Pollster.com has a nice writeup on the ARG results which I can
actually read in Firefox.  Executive summary, not terribly surprising,
not a huge swell of &quot;impeach now&quot; sentiment, and ARG gets higher
pro-impeachment numbers than all other polls.

http://www.pollster.com/blogs/arg_and_others_on_impeachment.php

&quot;One might also ask if the ARG survey results are typical of responses
in other polls. There the answer is no, the ARG results show more

I see your problem. You missed the fact that there's an inference

one now. Sorry, but that isn't necessarily the case, and therefore
can't be introduced as a &quot;fact&quot;. As a matter of fact, I think the
matter of the discrepancy was only introduced to cast aspersions on
the results of the ARG poll, a bit of sly propaganda, which you of
course lapped right up. If the point of the piece was to show there
was no groundswell for impeachment, why not just compare the two ARG
numbers and be done with it?

As far as the two ARG polls go, I see an upward trend between  42 -
45%, don't you? In the Rasmussen poll I see and upward trend between
32 - 39% as well. That averages out to 42% of the public in favor of
impeachment, trending upward. These are real numbers, not Republican
talking points, and they look serious.

And that is the huge, glaring fact that you are overlooking. No amount
of turd-polishing extrapolation changes the fact that your boy is in
deep trouble.

Feel free to supply us with some real data. You know, facts. I've
introduced two different sets of numbers indicating an increase in
public sentiment in favor of impeachment. So far you have introduced
no new facts to the debate at all. All this other tripe proves

&gt;&gt;I see. Pervasive corruption in the legislative branch is unacceptable,

I believe no such thing. I said there was a large discrepancy in 06. I
didn't make a judgement as to which poll was correct. The Rasmussen
results indicate a 7% increase and seem to fall in the middle of the
ARG and the Time/Newsweek results. Without any new Time/Newsweek data
you can't assert that there isn't an increase in public sentiment for
impeachment. Not when I have new numbers that plainly show there is.

&gt;&gt; You, OTOH, appear to believe that ARG was way on the high side in 06,

&gt; I believe no such thing. I said there was a large discrepancy in 06. I
&gt; didn't make a judgement as to which poll was correct. The Rasmussen

&gt;&gt; If Mr. Bush is in deep trouble, imagine how much trouble Ms. Pelosi

&gt; And they should be. They caved on the war they were given a mandate to

Camille sez...

&quot;While I would love to have Congress nail Dick Cheney to the wall (like one
of his flea-bitten hunting trophies), I just don't see convincing evidence
of an impeachable offense by either him or George Bush. There's an
accumulation of gross improprieties, yes, but none of them thus far in my
view would necessarily lead to conviction and ousting from office. Whether
Democrats like it or not, Bush is a duly elected president and has
considerable latitude (including pardons) in that role.

Beyond that, I think the impeachment scenario is a distracting fantasy that
could end up losing the Democrats the next election. The public will not
look favorably on Congress (already rock bottom in the polls) tying itself
up in knots with endless investigations and show trials. Democrats should be
focusing their energies on devising a winning campaign strategy for 2008.
Obsessing on the past, particularly via the maddeningly quibbling
trivialities that an army of lawyers would bring to this project, is a dead
end.&quot;

Hey Fred! New poll numbers in. These are from the *very* conservative
magazine, Human Events. They're polling 39% in favor of impeachment as
well, With 42% of independent voters in favor. Looks like those ARG
and Rasmussen numbers aren't so wildly inaccurate. How does that
&quot;entirely reasonable inference&quot; without any new data look now?

Of course they echo your (probably true) assertion that impeachment
would be a bad political move for the Democrats (presently) but,
unlike you, they are not denying the &quot;astounding public sentiment
expressed in this poll&quot;. Republicans in the know aren't whistling past
the graveyard when it comes to how much this sentiment damages their
chances in 08.

http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=20610

Special Report: Bush-Cheney Impeachment Might Be Idle Talk, But
Numbers Show True Trouble

Anti-war Congressman John Murtha of Pennsylvania is prominent among
some Democrats in his use of the &quot;I&quot; word -- impeachment -- about
President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Murtha made
his comments on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and elsewhere.

Few serious observers think things will ever get to actual
impeachment. And yet the American public seems more open to the
concept than many imagine, according to a new national poll. The
implications of this public sentiment could be huge for the 2008
presidential elections.

Our InsiderAdvantage/Majority Opinion poll asked this:

&quot;Would you favor or oppose the impeachment by Congress of President
George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney?&quot;

Favor: 39%

Oppose:55 %

Undecided/Don't Know: 6%

The survey of 621 registered voters has been weighted for age, race,
gender and political affiliation. The poll has a margin of error of
plus or minus 4%.

About four out of 10 Americans favor impeaching the president and vice
president. But the biggest news from this survey is not the overall
results, but the opinions of independent voters, who usually decide
presidential elections.

Forty-two% of independents want Bush and Cheney impeached. These
aren't just voters who disapprove of the White House. Instead, they're
for initiating a process that could remove them from office.

To help put these startling numbers into perspective, I turned to the
man most identified with the impeachment of Bill Clinton in the 1990s,
former Congressman Bob Barr.

Recall that Barr initiated the Clinton impeachment process by filing
what's called an &quot;Inquiry of Impeachment.&quot; That's a resolution that
precedes an actual &quot;Bill of Impeachment.&quot; In the case of Clinton, it
was filed long before anybody had heard of Monica Lewinsky.

Analyzing the InsiderAdvantage polling numbers, Barr said, &quot;This
indicates the surprising depth of dissatisfaction with Bush.

&quot;I'm not sure we -- [the leaders behind Clinton's impeachment] -- ever
really had hard polling numbers in favor of impeachment that were this
high when we were in the midst of the process. Perhaps, but I don't
recall it.&quot;

Those few in the Democrat-controlled House who are advocating
impeachment are on the fringe of political thought -- at least for
now. That's probably justifiable. Their reasons for impeachment look
specious.

Yet one can't help but recall that Barr sounded like a lone voice in
the wilderness when he first targeted Clinton. And one of his
&quot;charges&quot; against President Clinton was the catchall accusation of
&quot;violation of oath of office.&quot;

It's not beyond consideration that what now seems silly political
grandstanding could get much more serious, especially if the Iraq war
continues to go badly, current scandals surrounding the attorney
general or White House political adviser Karl Rove get worse, or new
White House scandals emerge.

Be all that as it may, the main significance of this public opinion
survey isn't its potential predictive value regarding the careers of
Bush and Cheney. Rather, the poll tells us that the Republican team
readying to assume the party's mantle when the presidential campaign
kicks off in earnest in the summer of 2008 might be facing
insurmountable odds.

Independent voters are the critical demographic in key swing states
such as Florida and Ohio. We track this segment of voters carefully
throughout presidential contests, and we know it well. Having no true
party alliance, independents can drift into either side's camp and
thereby elect the president.

The fact that such a large percentage of these voters are willing to
support something as drastic as the impeachment of the president and
vice president tells me that the depth of the irritation with the
president over his handling of the war, and over his political tin ear
when (not) listening to the public's rising discontent, is becoming a
powerful political force in itself.

Having been close to former Speaker Newt Gingrich when his Republican-
majority House of Representatives pushed for the impeachment of a
president, I can vouch that pursuit of impeachment can be tricky
enough to backfire on those who initiate it.

That's why I don't expect current Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California to allow the nascent impeachment movement to grow much
larger.

Nevertheless, the astounding public sentiment expressed in this poll
illustrates just how far Bush and Cheney may have set their party
back.

Whatever you say, Fred. Tell you what. I'll grant you your point. You
&quot;win&quot;. How about you grant me this one:

With three different polls averaging to 41% of Americans in favor of
impeachment, it might be reasonable to say that it is by no means a
&quot;fringe&quot; idea among the voting public.

Agree?

The talking heads and politicians may chuckle at the hoi polloi now,
but come election time the tables tend to get turned. There are lots
of Democrats in that 41% who are angry at their own party leaders for
throwing away the impeachment option, and won't forget at the polls.
This is the broader point I'm tying to make. So when you say the
Democrats are &quot;smarter&quot; than me about impeachment I must point out
that they're &quot;smarter&quot; than a pretty significant percentage of the
electorate as well - enough of a percentage to send their asses
packing. Common sense might dictate that they at least consider not
taking the option of impeachment off the table entirely.

&gt; Bush-haters to present their claims in a courtroom setting rather than
&gt; the liberal echo-chamber.  Another would be that failure to convict
&gt; after impeachment would mean the almost certain destruction of the
&gt; Democratic Party as we know it today.  The nutter Left would have to
&gt; be publicly and violently ejected from the Democratic party if there
&gt; is no conviction.
">

Now there you go with all that nutter talk again. ;)

I say let the chips fall where they may. As far as the destruction of
the Democratic party goes, I couldn't care less. I'm trying to be an
advocate for the Constitution, and from what I've seen of this
administration I think the claims against it damn well ought to be
brought up in a courtroom setting, televised for the American people.
You seem pretty certain there wouldn't be a conviction. I think that's
a precarious position, considering the course of the ongoing
investigations, with Republican support for Bush in Congress melting
away due to an angry constituency. So we have a difference of opinion
here. That doesn't make either one of us nutjobs.

&gt; &gt;I don't know whether they will or not, but they should *never* have
&gt; &gt;given Bush carte blanche by saying &quot;impeachment is off the table&quot;. The
&gt; &gt;guy just ordered a private citizen to ignore a congressional subpoena!

&gt; That private citizen had acted as a confidante to the Chief Executive.
&gt; There is some reason here for Mr. Bush's actions.  It will be up to
&gt; the Courts to decide who wins this power struggle.

Let's assume for a moment that his reason is entirely altruistic
(*snicker*) and he has done this in an effort to get the Courts to set
a precedent, expanding Executive power in furtherance of the precious
&quot;unitary executive&quot; theory. If he wins, the Executive will of course
*always* have this power. What is your opinion on this issue? Would
you feel comfortable with, for example, a president Hillary Clinton
possessing the power to swat down congressional subpoenas?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;Impeachment is the Constitution's only recourse against an
&gt; &gt;overreaching Executive. The Democrats took an oath to defend the
&gt; &gt;Constitution, not the Democratic party. For them to declare part of
&gt; &gt;the Constitution null and void to facilitate some sort of political
&gt; &gt;strategy seems to me to violate that oath.

&gt; I think you are ignoring &quot;elections&quot; as another answer to overreaching
&gt; Executives.

Elections get rid of the person once his term is over, but they don't
check the overreach, which is precisely why the founders provided for
impeachment. An impeachment prevents dangerous precedents from being
set and tells future Executives that there are lines they cannot
cross. Surely you can see the difference. It's not necessarily about
getting rid of the person, but about making sure that the balance of
power among our branches of government is preserved.

Ummm, I don't think you have to be quite that suspicious.  There is
one important reason that is perfectly rational.  A President can't
get decent advice if the advisor will 1) have to testify about the
advice publicly and 2) defend herself against politically motivated
attacks on the advice.  The advisor will be conflicted: do I tell the
truth, however awkward, or do I take the safe course?  I think it is
perfectly reasonable that a President, or a Member of Congress, be
allowed a circle of inviolable advisors who can speak their minds
without fear of prosecution on political grounds.

How about legal grounds? Wouldn't you hope these advisors would feel
conflicted about recommending illegal activities to the President, or
are those perfectly reasonable too? Should the advisors be
&quot;inviolable&quot; if they are breaking the law? Doesn't Congress need to
find out if laws are being broken as part of its oversight
responsibility under the Constitution? I can understand executive
privilege being claimed on particular topics brought up during
questioning, but a blanket claim of executive privilege just to keep a
particular person from testifying? Come on!

The logic of your argument sounds *very* familiar, BTW. Oh yeah, I
remember! It was a Supreme Court case - U.S. v Nixon - the Watergate
tapes case. Here's how the Court expressed your argument:

&quot;The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his
conversations and correspondence ... has all the values to which we
accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those
values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in
candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential
decision-making. A President and those who assist him must be free to
explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making
decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express
except privately. These are the considerations justifying a
presumptive privilege for Presidential communications. The privilege
is fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted
in the separation of powers under the Constitution.&quot;

But ...

&quot;[W]hen the privilege depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated
claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations,
a confrontation with other values arises. Absent a claim of need to
protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets,
we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very
important interest in confidentiality of Presidential communications
is significantly diminished by production of such material for in
camera inspection....&quot;

We all know how the court decided.

How about we add one more possible reason for this confrontation? A
stalling tactic by Fred Fielding, designed to run out the clock just a
little more. He probably knows this one isn't going to fly, but it
will waste a few more weeks.

No, but you have a chicken and egg situation here if you can't tell

In a slightly different context, your argument would be &quot;shouldn't the
