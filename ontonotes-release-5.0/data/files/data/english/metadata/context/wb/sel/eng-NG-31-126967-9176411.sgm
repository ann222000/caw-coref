Sometime after the version of firmware that I'm currently running
(20070131) SiliconDust has apparently added a lock to the HDHomeRun
to prevent the loading of firmware older than the current version.
Can anyone who has been following the versions tell me the latest
version I can load without being locked in?  SiliconDust won't say.
This lock makes it impossible to back out an upgrade if there are
application compatibility problems.

Why would they do something that idiotic?  Are the DRM police after them?  I
read a piece in today's NYT that said:

&quot;Jesper Johansson--a former senior program manager for security policy at
Microsoft who moved to Amazon in September last year--wrote in his blog on
Monday that he may drop Windows Media Center for LinuxMCE, a free
open-source add-on to the Kubuntu desktop operating system, because problems
caused by Microsoft's digital-rights management (DRM) software have proven
so difficult to fix.&quot;

http://www.nytimes.com/cnet/CNET_2100-1016_3-6210131.html

I'm detecting a slow and steady burn from customers about all the DRM crap
that they paid for (not Hollywood) and that inhibits their use of digitial
media under the supposition that if you want to do anything but what they
tell you, you're a crook.

Maybe if you ask some tech writers like the guys at CNET why HDHomeRun is
&quot;locking&quot; their firmware the HDHR folks will &quot;back out&quot; of their recent
policy change.   It's worth a shot.

I don't know.  They have now responded with two different explanations
(one about different &quot;factory calibration&quot; and another about a new
firmware format that has the property that if you were to be able to
downgrade to the previous version it could &quot;damage&quot; the hardware).  They
also said that there are two classes and it's just that you can't downgrade
between classes.  But that doesn't seem to agree with a message from a user
who couldn't downgrade from a beta to the previous real release, both
well into the second &quot;class.&quot;  The user is unable to make recordings longer
than 38-40 minutes.

|Are the DRM police after them?

I asked that and they said no.  They have been adding various phone-home
&quot;features&quot; which are supposed to be off unless explicitly turned on, but
one user reported that the device was hitting his firewall with outgoing
requests 300(?) times per day even though he had never enabled it to phone
home.  The firmware also got a lot bigger recently with no obvious significant
increase in user-visible functionality.

I find it hard to believe that they do not understand the debugging 101
rule that says that if a change breaks something the first thing you test
is undoing the change.  They claim that all firmware releases are completely
backwards-compatible so you never need to back out an upgrade, but this was
certainly not true in the past.  I think they must have a really good (for
them) reason for doing this and I'm concerned that it will turn out to be
a bad reason for users (beyond the debugging issue).

I was never really comfortable with the encrypted firmware (preventing a
quick &quot;strings&quot; from showing the latest command changes) but I understood
they want to protect their intellectual property from reverse engineering.
Taking that in combination with this new change, though, I must regretfully
withdraw my recommendation of the product...

Two different explanations?  They're beginning to sound like Phil Spector's
attorneys offering any possible theory of the crime other than he killed the
victim.  The &quot;damage the hardware&quot; theory sounds just like the BS Apple is
spreading about hacks to the I-phone rendering the phones useless after they
issue a SW upgrade.  AP reported that as gospel without even bothering to
talk to a single person who actually did the hacking.  AP obviously means
&quot;Apple Propagandists&quot; and not Associated Press.  The only time I've heard of
firmware changes damaging hardware was in PCs, where a firmware change
prevented CPU cooling fans from operating at the proper speed.  I'm sure it
happens, but it sounds like BS in a device like the HDHomeRun.

I'm amazed at how quickly HW and SW makers have assumed everyone has an
Internet connection and will gleefully let both talk to whomever they
choose.  When I worked in a classified lab, hooking a PC to the internet,
even for a FW bump, would invalidate the unit's security and it would have
to be completely recertified under the assumption that once it's connected
to the WWW, all bets are off in terms of data security.  What do the &quot;home
phone&quot; features do for the end user?  Or is this just more of nosey
manufacturers wanting to know everything about their customers, even if
those customers don't want to participate knowingly in their data collection
efforts?

I suspect you're entirely correct.  I would suspect they've added something
to prevent recording of material broadcast with the &quot;no copy&quot; flag set, but
they're not a recording device, per se, although it's obvious that HDHR
owners will likely be recording programs as VCR owners have been doing for
decades.  Hollywood always hated that idea, even though it turned out to be
immensely profitable for them in the long run.

Perhaps someone figured out how to break their encryption so they've moved
to a stronger protection algorithm.  I think that would explain the sudden
code growth and maybe even the lack of backwards compatibility.  I guess
they never heard the old saying &quot;for every tall wall, someone's building a
taller ladder, somewhere.&quot;   Too bad.  I sounded like a nice device.  I just
got a hi-rez LCD TV only to discover that nearly every HDTV signal I get on
my Comcast connection is 720, not 1080, so I've got black bars everywhere!

I'm beginning to wonder if the real effect of the forced marched to digital
TV won't really be the end of network TV as we know it.  Despite all the MTV
tricks broadcasters are using like screen crawls to attract younger viewers,
the average age of TV watchers is much, much older than the advertisers
would like.  Some studies are showing that all the screen clutter not only
doesn't attract younger viewers, but it actually causes their largest
demographic, the 24+ year old viewers, to go to Netflix or just read a book.
Someday, probably when it's too late, they'll realize that older people have
the most disposable income to spend.  Another reason people are leaving TV
(the Emmys got the lowest ratings ever) is the paucity of good programs on
these days.  Hi-rez garbage is still garbage.  If a show's any good, it will
make it to DVD eventually.  Then I can watch it without the ever-growing
number of commercials.

I'm going to forward this thread to someone at CNet.  Maybe *they* can
elicit the truth from SiliconDust in the face of potential bad publicity.
It sounds an awful like they're embedded some sort of spyware in the new
code.  I just can't imagine to what end other than pissing off enough loyal
customers like you to drive them out of business because no one will refer
friends to them any more.

At least Nick has promised to help you should their promise of the new FW

How very nice of them.  It's those kind of replies that give tech support a
bad name.  That almost implies that they're being nice to you and could
demand you stop using the unit if you didn't upgrade.  Worse yet, their

That's pretty much the way it is with PC BIOS firmware.  I've never known
any PC BIOS's creators to engage in downgrade lockouts, though.  There's
something happening here, as the Buffalo Springfield used to sing, and what
it is, ain't exactly clear.  And as you noted before, it probably isn't good
for the end user.  SD's answers left more questions than not as to what
exactly happened with the lockout other than the vague threat of damaging
your unit in some unspecified way.

I suppose that's a fairly legitimate reason for it to want to phone home
fairly often.  The state of HD broadcasts around here is pretty &quot;iffy&quot; so
I'd imagine anyone making HDTV hardware would want to know as much about the
environment as they could.  But from what you describe, it doesn't sound
like it's as voluntary a process as it should be.

As if there's anything I've seen yet worth recording. (-:  I would think
they'd have a better chance of evading draconian DRM concerns because
there's no recording device built into their box, but I suppose that
realistically, lots of people will record stuff.  I read an article in the
NYT about the second life many TV shows are getting via Netflix and DVD.
Apparently scripted shows fare much better in the second life market because
once you know who won &quot;Survivor&quot; or &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; the thrill on seeing
re-runs diminishes.  On the other hand, I can watch L&amp;O episodes three or
four times and not remember who done it.  Senility, mostly, but it does
cause me to rent the disks from Netflix.  I never realized how many
commercials we're bombarded with until I began watching TV via Netflix.  The

aren't any commercials to cut to.

No yet, anyway.  They may be planning to include DRM, though.  I know a

It may be the case that, due to the firmware image becoming larger, that
the old firmware format was insufficient for anticipated future firware.
So perhaps what they have done is inserted a new firmware loader in the
last release under the old format, and committed to using the new format
thereafter.

The above is just a plausible guess.  In this case you could also detect
if that scenario might be the case.  If they require this firmware version
to be a step taken to upgrade beyond it from versions before it, that could
very well be the case.

They don't require that, so any of the new, larger, can't-be-backed-out
images must be loadable by the original loader.  I suppose all the newer
images could be part of a transitional process and include a new loader,
especially if the loader provides necessary services to the image beyond
loading it (i.e., it's more a BIOS than just a loader).  Of course, if
they had just explained this it would be a lot easier to believe.

Yes, unfortunately, based on past experience I suspect the nature of his
help would be to admonish me to use the &quot;supported&quot; software rather than
my own.  Back when I first bought the HDHRs and had not yet written any
software for them I was testing with the supplied Windows GUI configuration
tool (no source supplied, of course).  It is a .NET 2.0 application and
I had installed it (along with the .NET 2.0 framework) on Windows/98SE
(which is indeed supported by .NET 2.0).  It mostly worked but could
not launch the VideoLAN Client.  I asked them how they were trying to
spawn the VLC executable.  Rather than answer the question in a useful
way he first told me that my computer would be too slow to display the
video (in spite of the fact that I had initially pointed out that if I
started VLC manually it worked fine to display the video).  Then when I
told him that the machine was a 2.8GHz P4 he said I shouldn't be running
Windows/98SE on such a machine and should immediately upgrade to XP which
would be fully compatible with anything I might want to run.  When I pointed
out that XP would not run any of the VxDs I load on 98SE and that in any
case I did not want to upgrade, the conversation ended.

Analysis of the Windows GUI configuration tool revealed that they were using
the UNICODE version of the CreateProcess call and were not including the
necessary thunk layer to work on non-UNICODE operating systems.  I was able
to patch it well enough for my initial test purposes...

| &quot;You are welcome to continue using the firmware already in the unit.&quot;
|
| How very nice of them.

Yes, that gave me a warm fuzzy feeling.  It's good to know I'm allowed
to use the hardware I bought.

| It's those kind of replies that give tech support a
| bad name.  That almost implies that they're being nice to you and could
| demand you stop using the unit if you didn't upgrade.  Worse yet, their
| &quot;phone home&quot; plan could contain elements of MS's Genuine Windows anti-piracy
| bushwa where they can knock out your machine remotely if they suspect you of
| criminal malfeasance.

I have the default gateway on the HDHRs set to a machine that does not
exist, but if they are clever I suppose they could snoop on other traffic
and find a way to the Internet.

| My favorite part of the thread?  &quot;Wow; what other product do we own where we
| get direct answers from the actual Designers/Developers within an hour of
| posting!!! Thanks guys, good to know!!!&quot;

Yeah, at first I thought he was a shill considering that the initial non-answer
took 4 days and was (I suspect) finally prompted by my inserting the question
in a few other threads...

| The answers to your questions happened to be some of the most INdirect I've
| ever seen.

So it goes...

| What are the odds that they'd confess they had a visit from the DRM law
| dogs?

Well, I'd expect that if they were really on our side (as they sort of
implied in the past) and there was no explicit gag order they would make
the information public to gain support.

| &gt; The primary use of the HDHR is as a tuner for various recording software,
| &gt; so yes, I'd say it is likely that owners will be recording programs. :)
|
| As if there's anything I've seen yet worth recording. (-:  I would think
| they'd have a better chance of evading draconian DRM concerns because
| there's no recording device built into their box,

I don't think so.  The broadcast flag proposals have always been about
preventing receivers from producing an unencrypted representation of
the &quot;protected&quot; material that they receive (even though the material
is broadcast in the clear).  The conventional channels of concern are
Firewire (for stand-alone set top boxes) and the PC bus itself (for
tuner cards).  Ethernet is just another transport medium.  Making the
recording devices secure is an afterthought to enable the selective
recording of some material once the recording device has established
that it will not let the material out of the DRM cage.  Receivers
with integrated recording devices are far less of a concern since they
do not need to expose the digital video outside the box.

&gt;It may be the case that, due to the firmware image becoming larger, that
&gt;the old firmware format was insufficient for anticipated future firware.
&gt;So perhaps what they have done is inserted a new firmware loader in the
&gt;last release under the old format, and committed to using the new format
&gt;thereafter.

Are you insane?  Think about some plausable numbers:  24K loader;  1000K
firmware.  Do you think you're going to slim down the loader enough to
make it worth the trouble?  Squeeze down the loader 25% and you've only
made 0.8% more available for firmware.

no
fucking
way.

I was considering buying one of these units. This thread has me thinking
otherwise now.
