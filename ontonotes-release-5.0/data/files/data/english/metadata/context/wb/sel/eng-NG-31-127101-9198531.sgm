--continuation of msg to Skeptic:

The key thing to do is assemble a brain trust, i.e., put together a
list of the the best doctors in the world that you have access to.
Then have them evaluate your condition thoroughly and give their
opinions.

You have to map out a strategy before you rush into battle!  You are
the commander-in-chief of this war.

I have a blog  where there are several good articles for you to read.
&quot;Straight Talk for the Newly Diagnosed&quot; is Johns Hopkins' advice to
newly diagnosed patients on how to go about seeking treatment.  Right
on point, even though you may not want to hear it. (See
prostatecancerblog.net.)

Shopping for a PC doctor is an arduous process.  You need to get
opinions from top doctors in a number of specialties in order to get a
balanced picture.  They'll probably contradict each other.  Then
you'll have to sort it all out somehow.

The best resource I've found is Castle Connolly's book, &quot;America's Top
Doctors for Cancer.&quot;  It should be available in your local library.
You should also read the article on my blog called, &quot;How to Find a
Good Doctor&quot; (*and hospital*).

Finally, I just discovered a great site called

: *expertmapper.com*.

They list top specialists in various diseases, including PC, by best
&quot;city, institution and persons&quot; (doctors).  And they cover the whole
of *planet earth.*  The results are based solely on professionally
published works, so it may be limited, but it looks really good from
what I saw (and great for browsing.)   Might give you some ideas for
&quot;prosta-tourism.&quot;

And btw, if you have anxiety, as you probably do if you're here, head
to Pittsburgh.

The lesser approach I took included
* consulting with 6-8 regional oncologists,
* picking one based on reputation, gut, credentials, knowledge, and
willingness to spend any amount of time with me, then
* doing the job and getting off the pot.

Why regional? Because between treatment and follow-up consultations,
we've now driven back and forth at least a dozen times to visit the same
uro surg onc who treated me and I remain a regular topic of discussion
by a large and broad board of oncologists of all specialties. After
three years with negligible PSA my uro/ surg/ onc/ professor/ researcher
still encourages me to e-mail him often, responds within hours, goes way
beyond the call of duty to take care of my medical and administrative
needs, appears genuinely glad to see me, paves my way within hours into
other specialists as needed, has never rushed me even when our meetings
hit two hours (our initial introduction was a phone call from him to my
home that lasted an hour), continually offers me the latest and greatest
tests available, knows many leading PC specialists and researchers
first-hand, and is a fount of knowledge on the latest world-wide PC
research.

Did I pick the absolute best surgeon in the U.S.? Don't know, but I
picked one helluva doctor for the long haul, and have no reason to doubt
his surgical expertise.

All the posts here and responses (thank you) naturally assume I want
to pursue the route that will give me the best chances for permanent
&quot;cure&quot; of pca, i.e. assemble the best team, investigate the best
regional and outside regional doctors, consider trad RP or robotic,
hormone therapy with radiation followup.....what I haven't made clear
is quality of life issues.
I am ready to die tomorrow if I had to.  What I am not ready to do is
embark on some permanent changes to my body (and mind) that I may very
well live to regret! (as contradictory and ironic as that sounds).
I epxect to undergo a RP, either robotic if possible or traditonal
open, but I really expect to cut off treatment after that.
I already suffer from depression and some other minor issues, yet my
only balance to that is my extremely active lifestyle and even more
active outlook on life, as well as running a business and travelling.
I am willing to put those on hold for the time it takes to recover
from the dreaded RP, but after that....i'm done (at least that's how I
feel now).
I cannot endure SE from HT, ext. rad., and endless anxiety attacks
over miniscule psa risings.....the treatment will surely put me over
the edge...and they always say attitude is important.
Anyway, sorry to unload my negativity, but I plan to take one step at
a time....maybe even one step only.
Still learning and trying to filter this all in.....

Hi Skeptic,

I hear where you are coming from, and I understand what you are saying.
Everyone of us has to make decisions about what is important for us
concerning treatments and side effects.  For some of us length of years is
not as important as it is to others, and we look at quality of those years
instead.  It is totally a personal decision, taking into
consideration one's own wants and needs from life.  So what's good and
suitable for one person, emotionally, is not necessarily what's good and
suitable for another.  That's why I try not to give advice, but to share my
experience.

I had an RP over 5 years ago---margins not clear---but with so-far good
results.  Though I had the RP with the idea I could follow it up with
radiation if needed, I have now ruled that out.  If my disease reoccurs, I
will not opt for radiation.  The reason for that is that I already have
proctitis.  You, with your IBS, know how that can impact your life.  I would
not want to risk having that made worse than it is.  If I were
bowel-incontinent, I don't think I would want to go on living---I certainly
wouldnt have much enthusiasm for it.  About HT, I don't know.  Right now, I
feel I would also rule that out, except if my disease became very
aggressive.  And even then, I don't know if I would.

We should educate ourselves thoroughly about this disease and its
treatments.  After that, decisions about what we will or will not do in
light of it are totally ours, and, except perhaps for loved ones who are
also intimately impacted by them, above criticism.

Best wishes for a successful treatment and consequent happy years.

Claude

I surely hope you read some of my posts on exactly these concerns from
Dec '04 through at least '05. While I don't fear PSAs or surgery like
you do, and am not as ready to die as you claim to be (you sound like my
Mormon friends in that respect), the rest rings true, especially your
&quot;extremely active lifestyle and even more active outlook on life&quot;. A few
sight bites from my posts include:
1. QOL has become a major topic of discussion here and in the research
and the literature.
2. Renowned oncologists have implored, in the literature and from the
dais, their peers to pay much more attention to QOL, have said ADT is
virtually guaranteed to dramatically impact active lifestyles, and have
even quit their ADT cold turkey due to its SEs, choosing instead to face
their terminal PC head on and &quot;bare naked&quot; (my words, not theirs).
3. Quit obsessing over having surgery ... either kind. Try to think of
it instead as your expensive but necessary ticket to a longer and
healthier life. [My surg onc says that even if my PC returns, I
shouldn't feel any major physical impacts from it for nearly a decade.
Hell ... who can complain about close to 75 years of vigorous, high-QOL,
life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness? Geronimo!] Even RRP is just a
nuisance, one you'll almost forget, especially considering your fit
body, within six weeks. You may not want to fly off to Katmandu within a
month, but the office will be a welcome change 2-3 weeks after an RRP,
sooner with LRP. Choose based on surgical efficacy, not convenience or
fear. I could bend down and pick up a sock from the floor before I left
the hospital and felt almost ready to play football at a month; my
surgeon forbade both (I had a more invasive surgery than you because I
had two unrelated cancers removed at once).
4. I thanked my surgeon recently for three long, great seasons of
windsurfing I would never have had if he had been adamant that I undergo
post-op ADT just in case I wasn't cured (I changed his mind with the
medical and personal analyses I posted here). He regards my written
&quot;It's not how many breaths we take; it's how often our breath is taken
away. Windsurfing takes my breath away many times a day&quot; as a vivid
reminder that not all patients think alike. [I had my ass whupped by
50-60 mph winds in 12-foot waves just last Monday, but at least I didn't
get tired just from watching it on the evening news.]
5. If our PC is not cured, our end will be pure hell regardless of what
we do to ourselves in the meantime, and ADT's statistically expected
postponement is arguably pretty dang small -- often downright miniscule
if measured in alert, cognizant, useful waking hours -- compared to
years of vigorous QOL.
6. It seems that for every new benefit touted for ADT, intermittent or
permanent, another facet of its dark side emerges in the literature. I
still have zero regrets about refusing Just-In-Case ADT after my so-far
successful surgery for my Gleason 8, SVI, negative-margin PC three years
ago.
7. I'll certainly consider SRT when my PSA hits the magic 0.6,
especially if &quot;they&quot; can find a target in my PC bed and/or &quot;rule out&quot;
distant mets, but ADT is way further off on my calender or my
consciousness. Fortunately, many companies are very heavily researching
new ways to pinpoint mets ever earlier.

No apologies necessary.  I cannot put myself in your cranium and would not,
therefore, question your thoughts.

I will, however, put myself up as an example of one who has experienced many
of the adverse effects of having cancer and of cancer treatments and still
enjoyed most of my fully viable life for the last 7 years since my
diagnosis.  And, when it comes to physical being, I'm no different from you,
likely.  I was, when diagnosed, a typical, overweight, under exercised,
probabem eating American.

While I appreciate the vote of confidence, I could name at the very
least a dozen guys and gals here who make me look like a piker in the
research department. Even at my peak, when I was actively making choices
affecting the rest of my life, I was barely up to par; as long as my PSA
remains low, so will my research efforts. They're a means to my end, not
an obsession.

As for my treatment program ... it's so highly personal, like many PC
treatment choices, that I can't conscientiously recommend my protocol to
another man. It's MINE, not necessarily the next guy's. OTOH, if the
next guy verifies my facts, reads my rationale, relates to my opinions,
has criteria similar to mine, and thus makes choices like mine ... I'm
not likely to try to dissuade him.

ON THE OTHER HAND ... to the chagrin of many, I am more willing than
most to frankly discuss certain major PC treatment topics which had been
glossed over here until I ramped up their prominence pursuant to my
decisions three years ago. Maybe the primary bar I set pretty high is
persistence, for better or worse.

Dear Skeptic,

Ted said to tell you that external beam rad is painless.  And I wanted
to apologize if I came across like a cheerleader.  I just meant to
suggest to you should explore *all* the options before you decide what
to do, or *not to do*.  I am pro-choice.  I think the last taboo in
these groups is talking about a man's decision to *forego*
treatment.   It's seen as cowardice.

And the American way is to always to be doing something.  And doing it
cheerfully.  Seems like we have every right in this country except the
&quot;pursuit of unhappiness!&quot;  In Japan, being morose is considered a
virtue, but here, in NYC, when I you say to a clerk, &quot;May I please
have my change?, you're told, &quot;Not until you smile.&quot;

The biggest &quot;attitude guilt trip&quot; I ever got was a few years ago, when
I happened to be walking near Macy's.  I passed a young man,
quadriplegic, who was sitting in a wheelchair. panhandling.  All
sunshiny. I must have been having a bad day, because he called out to
me: &quot;Smile, you have a pretty face.&quot;

Now trust me, that's being positive.

I read an obit about Joe Nuxhall a few days ago and thought: &quot;If only
he'd bequeathed me his attitude.&quot;

As far as you specific concerns: you should be able to resume all of
your present activities after RP or RT.  My husband had both, and he
still works out 4 times a week at the gym.  I would have been very
happy if it all ended there.

And you don't have to apologize for being  negative.  If you were not
feeling bad in this situation, you'd be abnormal.  But things can go
from black to gray, maybe even white -- don't assume the worst.  After
my husb was diagnosed with a recurrence in late Jan., I felt only
shock and dread.  Thought I was going to fall apart.  But the  anxiety
went away completely after we chose a treatment for him,and I felt
assured that he was in the hands of the best doctor and the best
hospital.   Then I let it all go.

Our problem was that we had wanted T. to be treated at MSK and MSK
only, but he didn't have the right insurance.  Took some work, but we
finally arranged it.  I remember the day T. called me to say he had
gotten his Blue Shield card. I was ecstatic. The first thought that
came into my head was, &quot;This is the happiest day of my life.&quot;
Actually, the &quot;happiest day of my life&quot; had been when he got his first
negative PSA test.

Unfortunately for me, the anxiety is making a comeback in a big way.
Waiting to hear the results of his SRT in early January.  Judgment day
yet again.  I finally steeled myself to read the thread about ADT the
other day.  I'm not a happy camper.

But you can count on getting emotional support here.  Reminds me of
something I read yesterday from the 18-year-old son of my friend,
Hughie K., who we lost recently:

&quot;I had hoped that my darling daddy would want to be buried, to give us
somewhere to visit and remember the beautiful big gentle guy he was.
He was my DAD. I trust him. I always did. He never lied to me. Oh hell
-- I LOVE him. He loved me for all my faults, I was his little boy
that he needed to look after and he was my big lovely daddy that I
hoped would always be there for and with me.

Now -- remembering the mad nights when I would come home the worse for
wear and dear Da Shuggie would be there to sort me out! His huge fists
were like Angels touches. God-sent. My Dada!  My hero - big huge
Shuggie, my Da.&quot;   [Please share this with others.]

I can only tell you that there are people here with angel fists.

Take care,

Leah

To HK: &quot;You have stown my very heart. I can die but canna part, my
bonie dearie.&quot; And hurry up and send us little Hughie James.

SCREW how &quot;it&quot; may be SEEN, Skeptic, regardless of whether &quot;it&quot; is end
stage suicide, cessation of ADT when its SEs become worse than the
alternative, or refusal of an advised treatment when it's likely to do
more harm than good. A doctor's foremost, often even *only*, criteria is
your longevity at any financial, personal, and family cost, whereas
the patient and his family may have entirely different priorities.
Running one's life according to others' opinions strikes me as cowardice
squared.

*However*, as my previous post said, do everything you can, especially
the newer meds, to defeat your clinical depression before letting it and
its resultant fear and anxiety impact your cancer treatment choices.
They're two separate medical problems.

It is an interesting study to determine what is and is not cowardice.  If
you look it up in the dictionary, you find that it is essentially the
absence of courage, valor, or bravery.  If you look those up, you end up in
an endless loop, each definition referring to the other two.

The definition of &quot;bravery&quot; is IMHO in a philosophical one.  There are
probably a thousand stabs at defining bravery.  Most deal with knowingly
risking something significant for some ultraistic outcome.  However, another
philisophical outlook tends to closely align bravery with stupidity.  If
one's risk is virtually certaint, the action might be more stupidity than
bravery.  If one's outcome is miniscule, almost any risk would border on or
surpass stupidity... or, insanity.

All of us have a host of decision criteria bombarding us that have nothing
to do with the efficacy of any particular treatment versus another; and some
of these change over time.  Using myself as an example, I watched my father
deteriorate before my eyes while on chemotherapy and decided long ago that
if I every got cancer, I would never go the chemo route.  Things changed.
First, I got cancer, changing imagination to reality.  Second, chemo for PCa
improved tremendously since 1982 and treatment for chemo side effects have
as well.  Third, my kids started popping out grandchildren.  A distant
fourth might be that I owe it to this NG to at least try it, when my time
comes, and report on it.

Was I a coward before?  I don't think so.  The risks were fairly certain and
the outcome was too.  Am I brave now?  Not really.  The risk is much less
and the results are more hedonistic than ultraistic.  So, if someone choses
treatments or non-treatments counter to my decisions, are they cowards?  I
think not.

Have we seen cowards here?  Almost certainly.  I've watched more than 800
victims come across this NG.  Some were extremely brave warriors.  Howard
Martin might be described as a very brave pacifist.  It is reasonable to
assume that a like number of cowards have communicated with us on these
pages and are still doing so today.  Some might be afraid of ADT for fear of
the unknown others try ADT, chemo, and all sorts of treatments for no other
reason than their fear of death.

I think we can identify some of the brave on this NG.  I don't believe I
have ever pegged a coward.

Would changing the word, &quot;opinions&quot; to &quot;labels&quot; or &quot;judgmental comments&quot;
make my sentence more palatable? That was my intended meaning, that we
should not abandon our values or change important decisions just because
others criticize us personally for making them. In particular, I can't
see how Skeptic's decision to forego treatment could be [legitimately]
perceived as cowardice, as Calalilly stated. My educated guess is that
it took him some serious effort and backbone to research the facts and
opinions on benefits and risks, define and discuss his own and his
family's priorities, take a deep breath, and choose. I see nothing easy,
let alone cowardly, about deciding to risk the duration of one's
remaining life in the hope of improving its quality. *Au contraire*, the
*easy* choice may be to bend over or spread 'em and accept a treatment
without research or introspection; reversing his decision just because
others call him a coward is in itself and by definition cowardly ... but
even that would be his choice, not ours.

Wow, you guys really get into all aspects of this....it's great,
actually.  No words go unnoticed...or under-analyzed do they?
Anyway, as you can see from my post title, I said &quot;rambling post,
sorry&quot;.  Part of my posts anyway, are probably just thinking out loud,
in a way and not necssarily what I will end up doing, as some of you
have pointed out (things and attitude) do change.
So I'm just asking, not &quot;proclaiming&quot;.
Basically, what I was asking, was
Will I accomplish anything substantial to improve my lifespan by just
having a RP and no further treatment?
Or is that a waste of time unless I go the full (probably recommended)
route of ADT and RT.....both of which, according to MY research, will
not be something I plan to submit to.  I am not afraid of SE's per se,
but I am afraid of what they will do to my mind....my motivation and
attitude. I'm assuming of course, that you can't just start and stop
these treatments at will...it's either a committment or.....a
postponement.
(btw, i still don't have the results of my bone scan, etc., so some of
this may be moot if things have mets away...otherwise, i'm tentatively
planning the RP in mid Jan)

In concurrence with Alan, you may be cured with RP and your worries
regarding RT and ADT will be moot.  However, it cannot be asserted that you
will improve your lifespan by just having RP and no further treatment.
You may, in fact, decrease your lifespan if you're not cured with the first
treatment and you refuse RT and/or ADT.

Again, using myself as an example, my RP was in DEC 2000.  By MAY 2002, I
had three consecutive quarterly rises in PSA with a doubling rate of little
more than two months.  Theoretically, my PSA would have been over 6000 by
Thanksgiving 2004.  Because I accepted RT in MAY 2002 and ADT1 in JULY 2003
and ADT2 in JULY 2006, my PSA is undetectable by a highly sensitive assay
and I will be celebrating several more Thanksgivings and Christmases.

Or perhaps it is I who misunderstood Skeptic's question.  I concur that RP
is almost always better than WW as far as life extension is concerned.  I
thought he had an odd notion that RP might be better than RP then RT then
ADT.  Since that never made any sense to me, you probably have it right.

Well, you might cure your cancer and die of something else much more
quickly and quietly 25 years from now. Or maybe you'll just incur a
month of downtime with little to show for it but a scar and an extra
year or five of high-quality heartbeat. Or maybe you might even wear
diapers and never see the business end of your penis again before
succumbing to now-undetectable brain mets three years from now.
Unfortunately, the outcome isn't our call; it's largely in the cards
already, with various hands (treatments) leading to various end games,
and the cards are in Al Gore's lockbox. The best key we have to Al
GORE's lockbox is on Al PARTIN's key ring, aka his tables. We read 'em,
maybe weep, play our chosen hand, and hope the odds go our way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or is that a waste of time
">

Probably not. Your high-risk PC will NOT go away by itself, any more
than mine would have; Round One, in the form of surgery or radiation, is
a no-brainer. Surgery, especially the wide-open gory version (it's no
longer very bloody), may well tell you a lot more about the remaining
cards in your deck than would some dude blindly -- very precisely but
still blindly -- frying your crotchal area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; unless I go the full (probably recommended) route of ADT and RT

Key word: &quot;recommended&quot;. Your thorough research and your priorities
trump &quot;recommendations&quot; every time. YOU, not they, are in charge, even
after you get a few shots or a few zaps. You may find that the power you
hold in this game can get you through much more hassle than you think
you can handle. Ordinary roller coasters scare the hell out of me, but I
LOVE racing dirt bikes at incredible speeds across virgin wild terrain
horses could not negotiate; the latter is infinitely more dangerous, but
is not (too) frightening because I'M IN CHARGE.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

PLAN? Me, neither. But those mice whose best-laid plans went all to hell
were also in a cancer experiment, just as you and I are. My PLAN is to
take whatever action seems to best suit my status and priorities as each
bend in this road approaches, and I can't see the next bend yet. I
rounded one bend three years ago, and am tearing down the straightaway
now in sixth gear. I'll have lots of time to evaluate the next bend when
I see it approaching, and I'm sure not going to plan for the curve
beyond that one until I get past my next one. There's NO WAY I'm going
to crank the steering wheel hard over and slam on the brakes right now,
when I can't even SEE the next curve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As long as you haven't been on ADT too long (?), you can always tell
your nurse to stick that next shot in HIS butt if you decide you're
better off without it. According to everything I've read and heard, ADT
*WILL* mess with your attitude, guaranteed. Whether that's better or
worse than the alternatives is unknown and highly personal.

RT, I'd guess that's true. ADT can always be stopped, and, as you know,
is often  intermittent -- with debate over the resulting primary and
side effects.

">

All my docs, when I start asking &quot;what-ifs&quot; about follow-on issues,
quickly shut me down, because it wastes my time and anxiety and their
time. Similarly, my present oncs told me years ago when I made my
previous treatment decision to stop spending my time researching this
stuff further, because there will be plenty of time for better-targeted
research on the latest findings when the next flag starts up the
flagpole. Example: my PSA doubled last quarter from 0.015 to 0.030, its
post-op high. Even if it kept that doubling pace up, it's still four
quarters away from decision time ... a whole windsurfing season followed
by early-winter research, mid-winter SRT, and then several more years of
windsurfing before ADT looks better than symptoms. And that's the
*worst* *LIKELY* scenario; I might still die of of a heart attack ten
years from now.

That's my plan and I'm sticking to it ... until circumstances persuade
me to change it. Whether this approach helps you is up to you; I provide
it as an example, not as advice.

I will not wander off into feelings. My (and his) probable lifespan is
not long enough to explore it, and it's not relevant anyhow.

Mike referred to *attitude*. Being &quot;messed&quot; with. He has alleged

Skeptic says exactly the opposite:
&quot; All the posts here and responses (thank you) naturally assume I want
to pursue the route that will give me the best chances for permanent
&quot;cure&quot; of pca, i.e. assemble the best team, investigate the best
regional and outside regional doctors, consider trad RP or robotic,
hormone therapy with radiation followup.....what I haven't made clear
is quality of life issues.
I am ready to die tomorrow if I had to.  What I am not ready to do is
embark on some permanent changes to my body (and mind) that I may very
well live to regret! ...
I already suffer from depression and some other minor issues, yet my
only balance to that is my extremely active lifestyle and even more
active outlook on life, as well as running a business and travelling.
I am willing to put those on hold for the time it takes to recover
from the dreaded RP, but after that....i'm done (at least that's how I
feel now).
I cannot endure SE from HT, ext. rad., and endless anxiety attacks
over miniscule psa risings.....the treatment will surely put me over
the edge&quot;

That's his call, and his history of depression and anxiety attacks is
highly likely to be exacerbated, maybe dramatically, by T deprivation.
And I can't imagine anyone claiming T deprivation could leave his very
high activity level unchanged.

I should probably interject that just recently, I lost my best friend

deteriorate while following everything his doctors &quot;made&quot; him do.  His
life was extended somewhat, no doubt, but his quality of life...and
especially of his family....was...just awful.  I admit to that
influencing my thinking about my own treatment.
It doesn't help when virtually all the research I've done is either

Well, THAT didn't last long, didn't it?

Back on topic .... Skeptic, just in case Calalilly's guesstimate
(lacking) of your research is more accurate than mine (probably
adequate), have you Googled or read books (by Jed Diamond, for example)
on male menopause, andropause, testosterone decline or deprivation or
low, etc.? While Steve may be correct (and if he is, my &quot;*will*&quot; was
inaccurate) that not *every* chemically castrated man will experience
changes in his moods/ emotions/ behavior/ attitude -- whatever one wants
to call it -- both the literature and the many discussions here
indicate that I'm not far off the mark. One of our best-informed
literature mavens here included this in his discussion of his ADT SEs:
&quot;My med onc and I have agreed that &quot;situational depression&quot; is normal.
IOW, in our situation, not to be depressed would be abnormal.&quot;

If we were discussing something statistically measurable and discrete
such as survival or time to biochemical recurrence, or if we were
discussing the whole list of ADT SEs, any absolute like &quot;will&quot; (other
than, &quot;Every ADT pt *will* experience some SEs&quot;) would be out of order.
However, in your case (as my original *will* statement specified) of
preexisting depression and anxiety attacks, I would bet my next erection
-- and I haven't had one one since surgery -- that ADT will affect your
&quot;moods/ emotions/ behavior/ attitude -- whatever one wants to call it&quot;.

theory as well.  ADT hasn't done a damned thing to MY attitude.

I should not have to tell a scientist this, but when you make an all or

His statement, therefore, was NOT true.  But your support of your answer was
correct.  Both RT and ADT can be started and stopped.  Commitment is a

&gt; I know once I do I'll never get out.
&gt; I should probably interject that just recently, I lost my best friend

&gt; especially of his family....was...just awful.  I admit to that

&gt; It doesn't help when virtually all the research I've done is either
&gt; conflicted and contradictory at best, or anecdotally confusing.
&gt; Whatever I end up doing..or not doing..I will be comfortable knowing I
&gt; made the choice myself.
">

I also consider that very important, but, as Calalilly says, valid only
if the research is fairly extensive. Do your homework to the point
you're satisfied that each incremental choice is as good as today's
technology and knowledge allow, implement it, watch your progress, add
more research when your PC so dictates, make and follow your next
choice, etc. With any luck we'll beat the damned thing into submission
until something else less manageable bites us first.

It's that, or fire every barrel up front, suffer the consequences you
can't treat, and hope it lengthens your life enough to warrant those
unintended consequences.

And even if our doctors were the best in the world, they would still
have different priorities than you and I do. My case is discussed every
quarter by a consistent team of several very experienced oncologists in
a wide gamut of specialties, but I balked at their post-surgery
treatment protocol recommendation for me. Instead, I explained my
priorities to them and concisely summarized for them all the research I
and this forum could dig up relevant to my case, then proposed my own
significantly different treatment protocol to them. Every member of the
board agreed -- and still agrees -- that my protocol was better suited
TO ME than theirs was.

I should add that my research conflicted primarily in degree, not
direction; ADT sucks and may add some time to our lives. How badly it
sucks and how much time it adds varies from source to source and person
to person, but the median estimates were unacceptable TO ME with the
numbers I had then (and still have). If I accept another treatment in
the future, it will be because my numbers have changed or some new magic
bullet has passed muster, not simply because I've changed my mind.

You asked whether any of us have gone your route. Yes. At least one of
us, plus many in the literature, has taken it a step further and
abandoned long-standing ADT because it was worse than the obvious
alternative (they had known mets).

The one thing we haven't seen you propose is trying ADT to see how you
react to it, either as an experiment or with the intent of keeping it up
if it's tolerable.

Maybe you and I define attitude differently. I said above that, in this

physical weakness,
joint disorders,
fitful sleep,
Chronic tiredness/ lack of energy,
Muscle soreness after any unusual exercise,
complete loss of libido,
hot flashes,
weight gain,
and in particular that “My mood and emotions were a big problem”.

Now consider Skeptic’s history of depression and anxiety attacks, fear
of short-term localized treatments such as RP, very high physical
activity level, and love of work and travel. Then add your comment that
your ADT SEs are worse than your RP or RT SEs,

I'll get back to IQ, for I found something pretty interesting.  But, as to
all the SEs you listed, you are 100% correct and I am honored that you
remembered.

However, none of these express my attitude.  My attitude is best stated, at
least in my understanding of the translation, in my signature:  Non
Illegitimi Carborundum.  Because of my attitude, I'm fighting the SEs as
well as the disease.  Because of that, some of my SEs are minimal.  I cannot
do much for libido or hot flashes, but I battle those I can.  And, that is
because of an attitude that I have and have kept pretty much unwavering
throughout.  Unless I have screwed up again with words and &quot;attitude&quot; is
synonymous with  &quot;mood&quot; and &quot;emotions&quot;, then you have to change the word.

However (again), you will likely find someone in the group who will disprove
your theory if you make any statement about ADT and say words like, &quot;all&quot;,
or &quot;guaranteed.&quot;  Unless you make an accurate statement like, &quot;all people on
ADT suffer from SEs.&quot;  I think that might pass muster.

Oh, and I promised a comment on IQ.  I recently (within the last year) took
several IQ tests for different reasons, one of which to inquire as to this
SE.  While I cannot remember phone numbers like I once did, or names, and I
have other foggy moments, my actual IQ is not diminished.  Strange.

I have always allowed for hyper-active life and, with Skeptic personally,
based on his self-described depression, I have been very careful to not push
him toward any treatment.  The pushiest I got was to suggest that he not
consider RT or ADT until he has a decision to make with regard to those.  I
don't know what his level is with regard to overload, but having lived with
depression for 31 years, I know that overload, or the perception thereof, is
a huge factor in whether an action is taken or the whole thing is dropped as
if no diagnosis were made in the first place.

&gt;&gt; memory problems including severe loss of word recall,

From Google &lt;dictionary attitude&gt;:
a mental position with regard to a fact or state.
a feeling or emotion toward a fact or state.
a state of mind or a feeling; mood.
a general feeling about something.
a complex mental state involving beliefs and feelings and values.

Could I have chosen a more perfect word? Maybe, but IMO this is close
enough for a subject as subjective as this one. If you have a better
(e.g., more accurate, less confusing) term (&quot;mental attitude&quot;?, mood?),
feel free to suggest it.

Yes, perhaps you are half right as to definition (not as to attitudinal
effect).  I should not have so quickly jumped on your combination of mood
and emotion.  Mood is very, very closely aligned with attitude and mine has
not dimished, nor has my attitude.  ADT plays tricks on my physical emotions
or at least the tears that manifest an overtly emotional episode.  To put it
in military terms, emotion would be closely aligned with tactical whereas
attitude would be more strategic.

But, now that I think of it, your attitude is certainly more tactical.  So,
maybe the way you look at an attitude, you may we right.  Or maybe, when it
comes to cancer, I have an attitude and maybe you do not.  I'll have to
ponder this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And wouldn't suffering affect one's mood/emotions, as it did yours?
">

If you asked, &quot;does ADT affect one's mood/emotions?&quot;, I might answer,
&quot;Emotions?  Yes.  Mood?  I think some in my family would agree, but I don't
know.  Attitude?  No.&quot;  But, I never said that &quot;suffering&quot; has affected my
mood or emotions, except possible to fortify my attitude.  I'm pissed at
this disease that might have kill by beloved grandfather, did kill my
father, will kill me, and might kill my brothers, my son, and my grandsons.

So, the thought of cutting it out and tossing it in an incinerator appealed
to me.  The thought of incinerating it with unseen lineacs (I like that
word) appealed to me.  The thought of starving the little fuckers (sorry,
ladies), and then making them unable to eat my testosterone very much
appeals to me.  The bastard keeps coming at me and you keep telling me that
I'm working too hard at keeping him down.  Well, my attitude is, don't let
the bastard wear ME down!  And, I try very hard to help all who will listen
to take up the banner to beat the bastard within their own bodies.  Is it
hard work?  Sure.  Nothing significant was ever accomplished without hard
work.  Will it win?  No!  I may lose my battle, but I will very grudgingly
give up my stake.  The more I fight it and the more I find who will fight it
with me, the more the scientists and medics will learn.  Soon (and I think
sooner because of our effort) my descendants will see the war won and the
bastard put to death!

I guess that's my definition of &quot;attitude&quot;.

Thanks, but my IQ number is not the salient point here.  The point that I

necessary affected and, more interesting to me, you can be forgetful and

I guess one thing i'm not familiar with (one thing??) is...are these
kind of therapies RT and ADT able to be &quot;tried&quot; and then stopped
immediately...and at will?  The only drugs I use are usually fast
acting, produce an effect and are optional (the anti-dep being an
exception....you shouldn't just stop it cold turkey).
A friend of mine was on ADT for 5 months prior to open RP with no ill
effects (according to him), but that was all he was prescribed.  My
uro has indicated it more as a traditional somewhat long term
tretament after RP...and that's what I wouldn't want....so could I try
it and then stop? (of course, I would be willing to suffer the
consequences if i did...that would be my choice...maybe not the best
one medically, but psychologically necessary)
(Note to Steve Jordan: could you email me if you so choose?  I'd like
to ask a few more questions about this.  I didn't see your email but I
believe mine is in my profile)

&gt; &gt; Back on topic .... Skeptic, just in case Calalilly's guesstimate
&gt; &gt; (lacking) of your research is more accurate than mine (probably
&gt; &gt; adequate),

&gt; ==== I would not recommend ADT in this case.  I would just add RT,
&gt; which can up the chances for success of RP by as much as 50%.
&gt; Adjuvant RT in particular (done immediately after RP before the PSA
&gt; begins to rise).  Skeptic would be a perfect candidate for this 1-2
&gt; punch tx,, in my opinion.  For a good summary of the added benefit of
&gt; post-RP rad, see endotext.org or my blog (Should You Add Rad to
&gt; Surg ... @prostatecancerblog.net).  I recently researched this issue for
&gt; my husband, who had salvage rad.  .
&gt; RT is relatively painless.  RP is a difficult tx.  You don't just walk
&gt; away from it and forget it.  And it most certainly causes permanent
&gt; changes to the body and /or its functioning.  It often takes months or
&gt; longer to recover continency and/or erectile function.  If you do
&gt; altogether.  And even when does by a hi-volume surgeon, as in my
&gt; husb's case.

&gt; So, either don't have the RP,, or do it right &amp; add the RT.

Yes, this was a stupid message.  Didn't intend to send the previous
one, except to myself, where it would have been laid to rest by myself
or Ted.  Dug myself in deeper!

-- I am no expert about potential surgical outcomes.

-- My purpose was to spread info about supplemental RT, which is
underused.

-- I know people who were doing triathlons 2 weeks after RP.  You hope
to be one of these.  On the other hand, there are doctors who go to
extremes to downplay RP, and surprises aren't always fun.   There are
things you can do to fortify yourself.

I think my brain was oxygen-deprived when I wrote that msg.  I had
finally gotten myself to read the thread about ADT.  Then I went to
the kitchen to get a drink  -- and fainted (twice).  Told T. I must
have eaten something bad.  So you are not the only one suffering from
anxiety, Skeptic.

I have tried to cut posting to a minimum, because I never want to hear
the dreaded words: &quot;Did you send that already?&quot;

Good luck.
