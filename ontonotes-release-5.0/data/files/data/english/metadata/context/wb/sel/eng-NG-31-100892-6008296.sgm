There will be a huge march in DC tomorrow to oppose the Iraq war and
the philosophy of the American government. I'll be carrying an upside
down American flag and depending on how strong I'm feeling may put a
black X through the field of stars. I am disgusted with the level that
the Democrats are taking the conversation to. Where is the discussion
of a mistaken US foreign policy? We propped up the Taliban and now we
are destroying them. We propped up Saddam Hussein and have destroyed
him. The pattern only begins there and extends backward through recent
time. Al Quaida are only the first in line. Perhaps this country should
address their greivances. If their greivances are valid then I am
forced to conclude that the US is a power hungry war-monger. This is
not a power struggle with a stronger nation. It is a power struggle
against humanity. This U.S. federal government is a failure.
Nationalism is failing us. Any nationalistic country is capable of this
type of failure...

How will the US dismantle its nuclear weapons? Dismantling the US is a
clear path to achieve this end. This is a path that conservatives might
also support. One might even argue that Bush is doing the ultimate act
in abusing the federal government to this point. The US does not make
wise choices. It makes greedy choices. We stab the backs of those that
we empower and American pay-offs rule the planet. I am a party to all
of this action since I pay taxes to the government and half of that
money goes to the Pentagon. I have paid for the bullets that kill
innocent Iraqis. Numerous misdeeds which I have no knowledge of are
done in my name. I refuse to accept these misdeeds even if they are
done for me or by me, no matter how indirect the path.

A march in the Capitol may be only symbollic to you. Carrying a flag or
even burning one may be only an informational message. One day this
energy that is still building via a social delay mechanism may break
the threshold and when it does where will you stand? Come to DC and
join with the conscientious; the conscious ones. While the rest are
asleep with the waves lapping at their feet you can awaken them. We do
not believe in killing. We oppose killing, but that does not relieve
the anger that we feel when our government kills with our money. This
level of indirection needs to be exposed. A brainwashed soldier pulls
the trigger. Who is guilty? You are if you payed taxes.  You are
especially guilty if you've ever worked on any pentagon funded
projects. You are if you work for a defence contractor. You are guilty
even if you are an American citizen. A sleeping mind is a brainwashed
mind. The soldier comes home and awakens with frightful images and deep
guilt for pulling the trigger. The social flux sweeps us along like a
bit of dust. To be a good dog what has one to do? There is a strong
distinction between the passive and the pacifists.

I have spoken with enough people about the anger that they feel. It
wells up and only diminishes out of exhaustion. There is a tendency for
these angry individuals to pooh-pooh the peace crowd. I know because I
am one of them. The peace crowd will heartily welcome you angry people.
Get your anger out. Do you take the red, white, or blue pill?

"... for me, truth is the sovereign principle, which includes
numerous other principles. This truth is not only truthfulness in word,
but truthfulness in thought also, and not only the relative truth of
our conception, but the Absolute Truth, the Eternal Principle, that is
God. There are innumerable definitions of God, because His
manifestations are innumerable. They overwhelm me with wonder and awe
and for a moment stun me. But I worship God as Truth only."
- M.K. Gandhi

Beyond these words I can only say that symmetry is a balance that rules
all things. Denial of symmetry will fail. Therefore the current path of
the U.S. federal government is a dead end.
Please join us in Washington, DC.

As I listen to Amy Goodman's coverage of Saturday's rally

I am reassured that the energy that I felt at this rally is a reality.
It is a strange space to feel the social tear that we are in the midst
of.

Perelman has something with his surgeries on Ricci flows.
Perhaps he can give some advice on the surgery that is about to go on
in this country. Even in its best outcome the organs of the U.S.
federal government will spill out on the table. As we are left sorting
through them the strange beast and its ugly insides require
amputations beyond standard procedure. Who can do such surgery? Surely
it will take the world's best doctors. So we will see them file in
with second and third opinions on which organs to pull first. Their
consensus will probably be that the beast must first be anesthetized
for any such investigation to take place.

That in itself poses a huge challenge. How does one convince this
monster that it must undergo surgery? If it can only see that as it
swells like a balloon it grows easier to pop... That a tear is already
underway...

Is it too late already for the ugly thing? Do doctors still have
compassion left for it? Under some circumstances such animals are best
put down and the monster knowing this may not accept anesthetic. So we
arrive at the present state, or at least my own fantastic imagery of
it.

I carried my upside down U.S. flag all day at the rally and could
easily have filled it up with signatories had I tried. As it is the
incidental acquaintences that I made form a verification of its
symbollism. People from around the US and even further (one man from
Bolivia) freely signed my flag and left their own messages on it.
Several veterans in wheelchairs even signed on. One declared that I
should not let the flag touch the ground. I explained to him that when
people sign it I put it on the ground and that it is upside down
anyways. He calmly held his position and then proceeded to sign onto
it. That's very meaningful to me.

The election of a d.p. majority to the congress has not quelled the
peace movement. If anything it has further engaged it. A few more
exposures of the monster's internals should help to understand that
like it or not things are going to change. If the proper procedures
are not taken the impact will be worldwide. Certainly those routes
which are known perils form a primary theoretical foundation which
needs to be addressed by the doctors and prevented. Operating with
this preventive assumption firmly verified would be helpful.

Perhaps a wide UN presence in the US could be helpful to monitor the
situation. I would breath a sigh of relief to see some light blue
hats. I'm scared. One more gash from an enemy and it is going to
explode.
