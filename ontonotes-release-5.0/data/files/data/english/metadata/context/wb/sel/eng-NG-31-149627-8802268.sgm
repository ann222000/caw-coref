Imam Zaman (a.s.) and Shaikh-e-Mufeed (r.a.)

If we turn the pages of history we will find numerous examples of
personalities who have enlivened Islam through their sacrifices of
life and wealth. One such personality is Abu Abdullah Muhammad Haaris
Akbari famous as Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.). Mufeed implies the one who
benefits others. He was born approximately seven years after the
commencement of Ghaibat-e-Kubra in the month of Zilqad, 336 A.H. in
the north of Baghdad.

Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) with the help of his vast knowledge passed
through various difficulties and welcomed all the obstacles that came
his way with a smile. He sipped real recognition from the ocean of
Wilayat and quenched the thirst of the followers of Wilayat. He was
attached to the infallible Imam (a.s.) and the Shias benefited
immensely from him. This man of medium height and wheatish complexion
had a ready solution for problems of a religious, ethical and social
nature. It is because of this that he had become a thorn in the eyes
of his opponents. At the age of 40 years, he shouldered the great
responsibility of defending the Shiite creed. It was an era when Greek
and Hindu philosophies were rupturing the fabric of traditional Islam.
Twisted beliefs and concocted views were finding their way into the
realm of Islam. The enemies of Allah had prepared the groundwork to
extinguish the light of truth. In such a situation, how could the one
who was given the title of 'Mufeed' by Imam Zamana (a.t.f.s.) and who
was the fifth descendant of Janabe Saeed b. Jubair (a companion of
Imam Baqir (a.s.)) sit quiet while ignorance and deviation were
raising their heads and corrupt beliefs and views were gaining
ascendancy as were the Sufis seated in their shelters (Khaneqaa)?
Expectedly, he lived up to his title 'Mufeed' and with the help of
Allah and His Proof (Hujjat) he laid low the false, corrupt beliefs
and nonsensical philosophies through his penetrative writings,
teachings and training of students for debates.

He rescued the people from deviation and invited them towards the
religion of Allah which was manifested through the teachings of Ahlul
Bait (a.s.). In this manner many deviated sects received guidance. May
be this was the reason why Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) called him 'Mufeed'
as he was a helper for Imam (a.t.f.s.) and a source of joy for people.
The above possibility is proved through various Tawqees (signed
letters) from Imam (a.t.f.s.) to Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.).

But have we ever pondered why Imam (a.t.f.s.) referred to him by the
title 'Mufeed'? Why he received so many letters from Imam (a.t.f.s.)?
Why Imam (a.t.f.s.) in his letter remembers Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.)
respectfully and calls him as his 'sincere friend'?

The answers to these questions manifest for us the remarkable
personality of Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.).

The respect of Imam (a.t.f.s.) for Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) was the result
of his memorable services for which he surrendered his entire
existence. For the satisfaction of the Imam of his time, he willingly
accepted all the difficulties so as to be enumerated among his
(a.t.f.s.) servants. He was engulfed in his love for Imam (a.t.f.s.)
in such a way that the flames of this attachment killed his desire for
the world and its allurements.

In the eyes of Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.), everything paled in significance
to Allah and His Proof (a.t.f.s.). His heart was a dwelling of the
love and remembrance of Imam (a.t.f.s.); it did not have any place for
worldly desires. He considered all his small and big works, his
behavior (ethics) and speech as the scale of love and satisfaction of
Imam Zamana (a.t.f.s.). He never desired anything other than this. All
his efforts and services were for the satisfaction of Imam of the time
and for propagating the beliefs of religion to the Shias with weak
faith. His life was based on the saying of Imam Sadiq (a.s.):

&quot;Our scholars are an obstacle for Shaitan to reach the weak and
helpless Shias. Know that whoever rises from our Shias for this is
better than a Mujahid who fights in difficult conditions against the
enemies. A Mujahid (only) protects the physical boundaries of people
but they (scholars) protect the religion.&quot;

With his untiring efforts in the path of Imam Zamana (a.t.f.s.),
Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) merits inclusion among Allah's best creatures. We
find in traditions:

'The best and most superior of all people after us are those who
enliven our affairs and invite people towards our remembrance.&quot;

This is the reason that Imam (a.t.f.s.) holds him in such high esteem
and lauds his efforts.

Imam (a.t.f.s.) in his first letter to Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) addresses
him:

'This letter is for my brother and friend Abu Abdullah Mohammed b.
Noman (Shaikh Mufeed) - May Allah keep him respected - May Allah's
Peace be on you, you have adorned yourself with our friendship through
sincerity and love and have preceded the rest in faith and belief...We
are thankful to Allah for the bounties of your existence. And pray to
Allah that He sends his mercy on our Master Hazrat Muhammad b.
Abdillah (s.a.w.a.) and his Ahlul Bait (a.s.). For helping the truth
and striving to help our friends, Allah has rewarded you and has given
us permission to correspond with you.'

'It is your responsibility that you convey our message and commands to
our Shias - May Allah give them taufeeq of His Obedience and safeguard
them in His Religion...'

In the last Tawqi, Imam (a.t.f.s.) wrote:

'Know that your actions should be such which bring you closer to us
and refrain from sins that are a cause of our dissatisfaction. O
Shaikh Mufeed! May Allah inspire you with success and guidance through
the unseen.'

(Ehtejaaj, vol. 2, pg. 597, Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 53, pg. 175)

The Tawqis which have been addressed to Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) by Imam
(a.s.) have been compiled by scholars in their books viz. Shaikh
Tabarsi (r.a.) in Ehtejaaj, Qazi Nurullah Shustari (r.a.) in
Majaalisul Momineen, Allamah Sayyed Bahrul Uloom (r.a.) in Rejaal,
Sayyed Muhammed Baqir Khunsari (r.a.) in Rauzaatul Jannaat, Allamah
Majlisi (r.a.) in Behaarul Anwaar, Allamah Muhaddisse Noori (r.a.) in
Mustadrakil Wasaail and Shaikh Abdullah Maamqaani (r.a.) in Tanqeehul
Maqaal and Mirza Muhammed Tankaabuni (r.a.) in Qasasul Ulamaa.

Mirza Muhammed Tankaabuni (r.a.) has recorded a Tawqi which is based
on a strange incident. Over here we have extracted only the relevant
portion from the incident. Marhum Tankaabuni narrates, &quot;A person from
the suburbs of Baghdad approached Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) to seek the
solution of a vexing problem. He asked, &quot;A pregnant woman has expired
but her child is alive in the womb, what do you say? Should the foetus
be removed through surgery or be buried along with the woman?'&quot;

Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) replied, &quot;Bury the mother along with the foetus.&quot;
On getting the reply, the man left for his village. On the way, a
horse rider crossed his path. He asked the man to halt and said,
'Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) has said that the foetus should be removed from
the womb through surgery and then the woman be buried alone.'&quot;

The person accepted it and acted on it.

After some time, the man came to Baghdad and narrated the incident to
Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.). Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) said, 'I did not send
anybody with this edict. It seems that the person was Imam-e-Asr
(a.t.f.s.) (who gave the edict)'. Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) says, &quot;After
this (wrong edict) I am not capable of giving edicts and undertaking
the responsibility of Marjaeyyat. After that day I closed the doors of
my house and told the people to no longer seek solutions of their
problems from me. It was not long before I received a letter from Imam
(a.t.f.s.) in which he (a.t.f.s.) wrote:

&quot;You give edicts, we will save you from mistakes and errors. We will
not desert you to commit mistakes.'&quot;

In this manner, Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.) by the order of Imam (a.t.f.s.)
shouldered the responsibility of Marjaeyyat and recommenced solving
the problems of the people.

At the end we can only beseech our beloved Imam - O son of Prophet! O
son of Zahra! We lack the spirituality of Shaikh Mufeed (r.a.). We do
not love you with the same intensity. On the contrary, we are immersed
in sins from head to toe. Help us to love you. O our Master! Help us,
look at us, to enable us toe walk on the Straight Path.
