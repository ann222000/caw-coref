There are a couple of sellers with good reputations on ebay -

http://search.ebay.co.uk/_W0QQsassZpolitepeteQQhtZ-1

I've been tempted to try to learn myself and never taken the plunge :-}

Just laughing at the negative feedback for Rikki's in the last month -

I've been told the Stagg ZM704 is OK in the cheaper range (made in
China); and the Yamaha YAS 62 is a good quality instrument (made in Japan).

Better to buy new than second hand.

Had a half hour talk with a tutor today.

Dunno about their prices for reed but for keys/studio gear I've found them
excellent in the past. In fact I have a new piano coming Tuesday from them
:-)

These look OK.  I guess one has to take the instrument on trust?

Don't buy an expensive sax if you're not sure you'll stick with it. Staggs
are OK but have higher left hand palm keys than other makes and give me
fingering problems. For a beginner I would recommend a second hand Yamaha
(e.g. the YAS275 - cheaper than the YAS-62) which is a much better
instrument and would depreciate less than a new Stagg if you don't stick
with it.

Good luck. I hope you persevere - it's one of the hardest instruments to
play to a decent standard, but well worth it.
