The Apostle Paul Was A Deceiver!

He was Satan In The Flesh! An Antichrist!

Matthew 24:4-5 states you will be deceived by people that come using
Jesus' name. Consider the parable of the sower. Jesus was warning us
then that as soon as His Gospel was preached, the enemy (Paul) would
be there to steal the truth!

Now before you throw a tantrum and wonder why I haven't been struck by
lightening straight from the throne room of God, I can prove to you
that Paul was a Fraud using his own words. Of course, if you're a
female, and you're in the ministry, you already know he was, you
probably just didn't realize it! For to be a female and in the
ministry of the Lord, you had to turn your back on Paul to follow
Jesus. Congrats! You figured it out! You refused to buy into the lie
pie Satan tried to sell you as Paul!

I'm going to make some startling points to wake your mind up into the
truth, so hear me out, then I'll go through and explain each one and
give you all the proof you need to see for yourself that what I'm
saying is indeed the truth.

Paul was Satan in the Flesh

Paul was never recognized as an apostle by the Disciples OR Jesus

Paul was never trained by the disciples, the men who walked, talked,
and broke bread with our Saviour. He received his knowledge from
&quot;revelations.&quot;

Paul's account of his Damascus Road Experience changed every time he
told it, thus the disciples knew he was lying.

Paul declared he was teaching another Gospel of which he himself was
the Father

Paul declared  he himself was the son of God

Paul issued his own commandments and laws for people to adhere to

Paul taught the exact Opposite of what Jesus and His real disciples
did.

Paul worked to destroy and undo everything Jesus and His disciples did
and were doing.

Paul was never repentant for being the greatest persecutor of
Christians at that time! He boasted about it! Over and Over!

Paul said God's law was a Curse. Jesus said it was a blessing. Who's
lying?

Paul condemned Jesus and His disciples for false teachings, he
condemned Jesus Himself for having long hair in 1 Corinthians 11:14,
something approved in Numbers 6:5 and Judges 13:5.

Jesus Said: Keep the Sabbath (Mark 2:27), circumcise male children
(Luke 2:21), Paul Said: Circumcision is not necessary (Romans 2:26)
that is going against what the Christ said in Luke 2:21.

In 1 Corinthians 15:1 Paul says that he was not giving them anything
but what &quot;he preached.&quot; He explained this even further in the second
book (or letter) to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:17). It reads -
&quot;That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were
foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.&quot; He's telling you plain and
simple he was speaking of himself and not from or of the Lord!&quot;

Paul cursed Jesus and His disciples

Paul claimed he himself was the son of God

Paul Supported and demanded Adherence to Iniquity (Discrimination),
Jesus said to not let it be found among us! Who's lying?

Jesus: When Yahshua confronts the Adversary, he defeats him by saying,
&quot;You shall live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of YHWH,
and Him alone will you serve.&quot;

Paul: When Paul is mobbed by people who wish to stone him for
preaching against the Law of YHWH, he relies on the worldly
authorities as a Roman entitled to the protection of the government
rulers who save him (Dt. 8:3, Mt.4:4, Acts 22:26, 23:27

Jesus: &quot;DO NOT CALL ANYONE ON EARTH YOUR FATHER; for ONE IS YOUR
FATHER, HE who is in heaven&quot;
(Matthew 23:9)

The devil 'PAUL' BLASPEMOUSLY BOASTED

&quot;For I BECAME YOUR FATHER&quot;
(1 Corinthians 4:15)

&quot; JESUS came to Galilee PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM &quot;
(Mark 1:14, Matt.4:23).
JESUS said &quot; THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM will be PREACHED, IN MY NAME
in all the world
(Matt.24:14).
'PAUL' CAME preaching, by his own admission, ANOTHER GOSPEL PROMOTING
LAWLESSNESS and LICENTIOUSNESS

many excerpts taken from disciplesofchrist.com

&quot;I ('PAUL') testify to the gospel of the grace of god...ANOTHER
GOSPEL...ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL &quot;
(Acts 20:24. 2 Corinthians 11:4. 1 Corinthians 10:23).

&quot;PERVERTING THE GRACE OF OUR GOD INTO LAWLESSNESS EVEN DENYING THE
ONLY LORD GOD (THE FATHER) AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST (THE FATHER'S
SON)&quot;
(Jude 4. 1 John 2:22)

'PAUL' CURSED JESUS CHRIST AND HIS APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES
&quot; If we or an angel from heaven preach ANY OTHER GOSPEL to you than
what we (Paul and his followers) have preached to you LET HIM BE A
CURSE&quot;
(Gal 1:18)
There was a distinction even back then with the disciples of Jesus and
Paul and &quot;his&quot; followers. Barnabbas and Mark both followed Paul at one
time and then left him and went back to the disciples. Barnabbas was
sent by the Apostle Peter  to travel with Paul and teach Paul the ways
and teachings of Jesus, but Paul wasn't going to play second fiddle to
anyone and  usurped the authority of Barnabbas and taught what he
wanted to teach.  How many ever knew that Paul was suppose to be
subservient to Barnabbas?

&quot;Indeed I PAUL say to you that IF ANYONE BECOME CIRCUMCISED Christ
will profit you nothing &quot; (Gal. 5:2).

too bad Paul! The circumcision was a sign of the covenant between
Israel and Yahovah and you're lie was exposed for what it was! Another
false &quot;divine revelation!&quot;

YET, despite his assertion that 'Christ will profit you nothing',
'Paul' himself, HYPOCRITICALLY &quot; took TIMOTHY and CIRCUMCISED HIM &quot;
(Acts 16:3).

Now Paul declares it's ok to eat meat sacrificed to idols

&quot; For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no
greater burden than THESE NECESSARY THINGS:
That you ABSTAIN FROM MEATS offered to idols, and from blood, and from
things strangled and from fornication...&quot;
(Acts 15:28:29)
&quot; But I (Jesus) have a few things against thee, because thou hast
there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast
a STUMBLING BLOCK before the children of Israel, TO EAT THINGS
SACRIFICED TO IDOLS &quot;
(Revelation 2:14)

&quot;a deceived person does not know he is deceived. &quot;

How can you refer this statement to Paul?

People can say anything, there is no logic to their statement, like yours
for example.  It makes no sense at all to what you are saying.  Now Stop!
Don't react, Think and Listen!  Paul was supposed to teach for the glory of
Jesus, and he did that.  If he worked for his own glory then that's a
different matter.  Remember Jesus is the Son, Not the High God, you made him
equal to God.  Jesus said, all power did not come from me but from above.
So where is your logic?  Or do you have one?

&quot;Normally a deceiver knows he is trying to deceive people.&quot;  the logic you
referred to is really made by &quot;An ignorant&quot; like yourself.

1-  The NT confirms that only Peter witnessed the crucifixion:

First of all, it is important to know that according to the New
Testament itself, all of Jesus' Disciples fled for their lives on the
night of crucifixion.  None of them witnessed Jesus' crucifixion
except for one, that is Saint Peter!  He was the lone and only
witness
of the actual crucifixion event.  Let us look at what the Bible's New
Testament says:

Matthew 26:34-35, 55-57, 69-75
34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
.......
55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
be
fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
sayest.
71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and
said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.
72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.
74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.
75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
Before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.

Now as we clearly see, Peter did witness the so-called crucifixion
event.  He was present there.  The only thing that saved him from
death is his denial that he knew Jesus.  Otherwise, he would've got
crucified that night.

Examples of third-party narrations in the &quot;Gospels&quot; of the NT:

Let us also notice the third-party narration in the &quot;Gospel of
Matthew&quot;, and in the rest of the so-called &quot;Gospels&quot; of the New
Testament.  Here are few examples:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From www.answering-christianity.com/authors_gospels.htm:
">

&quot;...And as Jesus passed forth thence, HE (Jesus) saw a man, named
Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and HE (Jesus) saith unto
HIM (Matthew), follow ME (Jesus) and HE (Matthew) arose, and followed
HIM (Jesus).  (Matthew 9:9)&quot;

&quot;And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? (From the King James
Version Bible, John 1:19)&quot;

&quot;John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
one among you, whom ye know not;  (From the King James Version Bible,
John 1:26)&quot;

&quot;For John was not yet cast into prison.  (From the King James Version
Bible, John 3:24)&quot;

etc.....

A lot more examples and proofs are available at:

Just who were the real authors of the Bible? Today's Books and
Gospels' authors of the Bible are UNKNOWN.  See the comments from the
NIV Bible itself!  Also includes detailed refutations and exposing of
Paul's lies.  See Paul's section in the article.  It also includes
proofs about the New Testament was written in the 3rd century by
Constantine and his church by their own words.  It wasn't written by
Jesus and his original Disciples.

Quotes from NIV Bible theologians, and Roman Catholic Encyclopedia
admitting that the Bible had been corrupt and the original
manuscripts
had been lost.  Also, proofs that it was Constantine and his church
who wrote the New Testament with their hands around year 300, not
Jesus and his original Disciples.

According to the NIV and KJV Bible's theologians, the gospels were
written by mysterious and unknown people, in unknown places and
unknown dates!

2-   The Apocalypse of Peter was written and spoken by Peter himself!

Unlike the Gospels of the New Testament, the Apocalypse of Peter (the
Revelations sent to Peter) was directly written and spoken by Peter
himself.  This Revelation was widely accepted and believed in by the
early Christians during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries.  Also listen
to this AUDIO file from Christian theologians.   The early Christians
clearly rejected the lies of crucifixion and trinity!

Here are the fragments of his Apocalypse.

(emphasis below are mine.  Pay close attention to the red ones.)

As the Savior was sitting in the temple in the three hundredth year
of
the covenant and the agreement of the tenth pillar, and being
satisfied with the number of the living, incorruptible Majesty, he
said to me (Peter),

&quot;Peter, blessed are those above belonging to the Father, who revealed
life to those who are from life, through me, since I reminded them,
they who are built on what is strong, that they may hear my word, and
distinguish words of unrighteousness and transgression of the law
from
righteousness, as being from the height of every word of this Pleroma
of truth, having been enlightened in good pleasure by him whom the
principalities sought. But they did not find him, nor was he
mentioned
among any generation of the prophets. He has now appeared among
these,
in him who appeared, who is the Son of Man who is exalted above the
heavens in fear of men of like essence. But you yourself, Peter,
become perfect in accordance with your name with myself, the one who
chose you, because from you I established a base for the remnant whom
I have summoned to knowledge. Therefore be strong until the imitation
of righteousness - of him who had summoned you, having summoned you
to
know him in a way which forth doing because of the rejection which
happened to him, and the sinews of his hands and his feet, and the
crowning by those of the middle region, and the body of his radiance
which they bringing hope of service because of a reward of honor - as
he was about to reprove you three times in this night&quot;.

And as he was saying these things I saw the priests and the people
running up to us with stones, as if they would kill us; and I was
afraid that we were going to die. And he said to me: &quot;Peter, I have
told you many times that they are blind ones who have no guide. If
you
want to know their blindness, put your hands before your eyes - your
robe - and say what you see.&quot;  But when I had done it, I did not see
anything. I said &quot;No one sees this way&quot; And he said to me, &quot;Do it
again.&quot; And there came in me fear with joy, for I saw a new light
greater than the light of day. Then it came down upon the Savior. And
I told him about those things which I saw. And he said to me again,
&quot;Lift up your hands and listen to what the priests and the people are
saying.&quot; And I listened to the priests as they sat with the scribes.
The multitudes were shouting with their voice. When he heard these
things from me he said to me &quot;prick up your ears and listen to the
things they are saying.&quot; And I listened again, &quot;As you sit, they are
praising you.&quot; And when I said these things , the Savior said &quot;I have
told you that these people are blind and deaf. Now then, listen to
the
things which they are telling you in a mystery, and guard them. Do
not
tell them to the sons of this age. For they shall blaspheme you in
these ages since they are ignorant of you, but they will praise you
in
knowledge - for many will accept our teaching in the beginning, and
they will turn from them again by the will of the Father by their
error, because they have done what he wanted. And he will reveal them
in his judgment, i.e the servants of the Word. But those who became
mingled with these shall become their prisoners, since they are
without perception. And they praise the men of propagation of
falsehood, those who will come after you. And they will cleave to the
name of a dead man, thinking that they will become pure. But they
will
become greatly defiled and they will fall into a name of error, and
into the hand of an evil, cunning man and a manifold dogma, and they
will be ruled without law.&quot;

&quot;For some of them will blaspheme the truth and proclaim evil
teaching,
and they will say evil things against each other. Some will be named:
those who stand in the strength of the archons, of a man and a naked
woman who is manifold and subject to much suffering. And those who
say
these things will ask about dreams. And if they say that a dream came
from a demon worthy of their error, then they shall be given
perdition
instead of incorruption - for evil cannot produce good fruit. For the
place from which each of them is produces that which is like itself;
for not every soul is of the truth, nor of immortality. For every
soul
of these ages has death assigned to it in our view, and their eternal
destruction, in which they are and from which they are. They love the
creatures of the matter which came forth with them. But the immortal
souls are not like these, O Peter. But indeed, as long as the hour is
not yet come, the immortal soul shall resemble the mortal one. But it
shall not reveal its nature, that it alone is the immortal one, and
thinks about immortality, having faith, and desiring to renounce
these
things.&quot;

&quot;For people do not gather figs from thorns or from thorn trees, if
they are wise, nor grapes from thistles. For on the one hand, that
which is always becoming is in that from which it is, being from what
is not good, which becomes destruction for it and death. But that
which comes to be in the Eternal One is in the One of the life and
the
immortality of the life which they resemble. Therefore all that which
exists not will dissolve into what exists not. For deaf and blind
ones
join only with their own kind. But others shall change from evil
words

The Qur'an canclled out Paul's teaching

Paul was an expert on the New Covenant
in Gentile's setting
as the author of the Qur'an was an expert
in the Old Covenant, circumcision, Moses
Law in Abraham's bilogical setting.
So by comparing the fruits of the two covenants
in their respective settings,
we can know whether Paul was a false

&gt; He was Satan In The Flesh! An Antichrist!

&gt; Matthew 24:4-5 states you will be deceived by people that come using
&gt; Jesus' name. Consider the parable of the sower. Jesus was warning us
&gt; then that as soon as His Gospel was preached, the enemy (Paul) would
&gt; be there to steal the truth!

&gt; Now before you throw a tantrum and wonder why I haven't been struck by
&gt; lightening straight from the throne room of God, I can prove to you
&gt; thatPaulwas a Fraud using his own words. Of course, if you're a
&gt; female, and you're in the ministry, you already know he was, you
&gt; probably just didn't realize it! For to be a female and in the
&gt; ministry of the Lord, you had to turn your back onPaulto follow
&gt; Jesus. Congrats! You figured it out! You refused to buy into the lie
&gt; pie Satan tried to sell you asPaul!

&gt; I'm going to make some startling points to wake your mind up into the
&gt; truth, so hear me out, then I'll go through and explain each one and
&gt; give you all the proof you need to see for yourself that what I'm
&gt; saying is indeed the truth.

&gt; Paulwas Satan in the Flesh

&gt; Paulwas never recognized as an apostle by the Disciples OR Jesus

&gt; Paulwas never trained by the disciples, the men who walked, talked,
&gt; and broke bread with our Saviour. He received his knowledge from
&gt; &quot;revelations.&quot;

&gt; Paul'saccount of his Damascus Road Experience changed every time he
&gt; told it, thus the disciples knew he was lying.

&gt; Pauldeclared he was teaching another Gospel of which he himself was
&gt; the Father

&gt; Pauldeclared  he himself was the son of God

&gt; Paulissued his own commandments and laws for people to adhere to

&gt; Paultaught the exact Opposite of what Jesus and His real disciples
&gt; did.

&gt; Paulworked to destroy and undo everything Jesus and His disciples did
&gt; and were doing.

&gt; Paulwas never repentant for being the greatest persecutor of
&gt; Christians at that time! He boasted about it! Over and Over!

&gt; Paulsaid God's law was a Curse. Jesus said it was a blessing. Who's
&gt; lying?

&gt; Paulcondemned Jesus and His disciples forfalseteachings, he
&gt; condemned Jesus Himself for having long hair in 1 Corinthians 11:14,
&gt; something approved in Numbers 6:5 and Judges 13:5.

&gt; Jesus Said: Keep the Sabbath (Mark 2:27), circumcise male children
&gt; (Luke 2:21),PaulSaid: Circumcision is not necessary (Romans 2:26)
&gt; that is going against what the Christ said in Luke 2:21.

&gt; In 1 Corinthians 15:1Paulsays that he was not giving them anything
&gt; but what &quot;he preached.&quot; He explained this even further in the second
&gt; book (or letter) to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:17). It reads -
&gt; &quot;That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were
&gt; foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.&quot; He's telling you plain and
&gt; simple he was speaking of himself and not from or of the Lord!&quot;

&gt; Paulcursed Jesus and His disciples

&gt; Paulclaimed he himself was the son of God

&gt; PaulSupported and demanded Adherence to Iniquity (Discrimination),
&gt; Jesus said to not let it be found among us! Who's lying?

&gt; Jesus: When Yahshua confronts the Adversary, he defeats him by saying,
&gt; &quot;You shall live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of YHWH,
&gt; and Him alone will you serve.&quot;

&gt; Paul: WhenPaulis mobbed by people who wish to stone him for
&gt; preaching against the Law of YHWH, he relies on the worldly
&gt; authorities as a Roman entitled to the protection of the government
&gt; rulers who save him (Dt. 8:3, Mt.4:4, Acts 22:26, 23:27

&gt; Jesus: &quot;DO NOT CALL ANYONE ON EARTH YOUR FATHER; for ONE IS YOUR
&gt; FATHER, HE who is in heaven&quot;
&gt; (Matthew 23:9)

&gt; The devil 'PAUL' BLASPEMOUSLY BOASTED

&gt; &quot;For I BECAME YOUR FATHER&quot;
&gt; (1 Corinthians 4:15)

&gt; &quot; JESUS came to Galilee PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM &quot;
&gt; (Mark 1:14, Matt.4:23).
&gt; JESUS said &quot; THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM will be PREACHED, IN MY NAME
&gt; in all the world
&gt; (Matt.24:14).
&gt; 'PAUL' CAME preaching, by his own admission, ANOTHER GOSPEL PROMOTING
&gt; LAWLESSNESS and LICENTIOUSNESS

&gt; many excerpts taken from disciplesofchrist.com

&gt; &quot;I ('PAUL') testify to the gospel of the grace of god...ANOTHER
&gt; GOSPEL...ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL &quot;
&gt; (Acts 20:24. 2 Corinthians 11:4. 1 Corinthians 10:23).

&gt; &quot;PERVERTING THE GRACE OF OUR GOD INTO LAWLESSNESS EVEN DENYING THE
&gt; ONLY LORD GOD (THE FATHER) AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST (THE FATHER'S
&gt; SON)&quot;
&gt; (Jude 4. 1 John 2:22)

&gt; 'PAUL' CURSED JESUS CHRIST AND HIS APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES
&gt; &quot; If we or an angel from heaven preach ANY OTHER GOSPEL to you than
&gt; what we (Pauland his followers) have preached to you LET HIM BE A
&gt; CURSE&quot;
&gt; (Gal 1:18)
&gt; There was a distinction even back then with the disciples of Jesus andPauland &quot;his&quot; followers. Barnabbas and Mark both followedPaulat one
&gt; time and then left him and went back to the disciples. Barnabbas was
&gt; sent by the Apostle Peter  to travel withPauland teachPaulthe ways
&gt; and teachings of Jesus, butPaulwasn't going to play second fiddle to
&gt; anyone and  usurped the authority of Barnabbas and taught what he
&gt; wanted to teach.  How many ever knew thatPaulwas suppose to be
&gt; subservient to Barnabbas?

&gt; &quot;Indeed IPAULsay to you that IF ANYONE BECOME CIRCUMCISED Christ
&gt; will profit you nothing &quot; (Gal. 5:2).

&gt; too badPaul! The circumcision was a sign of the covenant between
&gt; Israel and Yahovah and you're lie was exposed for what it was! Anotherfalse&quot;divine revelation!&quot;

&gt; YET, despite his assertion that 'Christ will profit you nothing',
&gt; 'Paul' himself, HYPOCRITICALLY &quot; took TIMOTHY and CIRCUMCISED HIM &quot;
&gt; (Acts 16:3).

&gt; NowPauldeclares it's ok to eat meat sacrificed to idols

&gt; &quot; For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no
&gt; greater burden than THESE NECESSARY THINGS:
&gt; That you ABSTAIN FROM MEATS offered to idols, and from blood, and from
&gt; things strangled and from fornication...&quot;
&gt; (Acts 15:28:29)
&gt; &quot; But I (Jesus) have a few things against thee, because thou hast
&gt; there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast
&gt; a STUMBLING BLOCK before the children of Israel, TO EAT THINGS
&gt; SACRIFICED TO IDOLS &quot;
&gt; (Revelation 2:14)

Which covenants? There is the covenant of the last supper and the is

The Abrahamic covenant would have applied equally to both the

Codebreaker, you are right. Thank you.

However I am using quotes from the bible and not the Quran.

There are many Christians who can differentiate between the Gospels
and the false statements of Paul.

I have earlier provided proof that the bible contradicts between the
Gospels and Paul. Jesus clearly instructed us to pray to our Father in
heaven but Paul caused confusion and teach Christians to pray to
Jesus.

Cheers

&gt; &gt; The devil 'PAUL' BLASPEMOUSLY BOASTED

&gt; &gt; &quot;For I BECAME YOUR FATHER&quot;
&gt; &gt; (1 Corinthians 4:15)

&gt; &gt; &quot; JESUS came to Galilee PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM &quot;
&gt; &gt; (Mark 1:14, Matt.4:23).
&gt; &gt; JESUS said &quot; THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM will be PREACHED, IN MY NAME
&gt; &gt; in all the world
&gt; &gt; (Matt.24:14).
&gt; &gt; 'PAUL' CAME preaching, by his own admission, ANOTHER GOSPEL PROMOTING
&gt; &gt; LAWLESSNESS and LICENTIOUSNESS

&gt; &gt; many excerpts taken from disciplesofchrist.com

&gt; &gt; &quot;I ('PAUL') testify to the gospel of the grace of god...ANOTHER
&gt; &gt; GOSPEL...ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL &quot;
&gt; &gt; (Acts 20:24. 2 Corinthians 11:4. 1 Corinthians 10:23).

&gt; &gt; &quot;PERVERTING THE GRACE OF OUR GOD INTO LAWLESSNESS EVEN DENYING THE
&gt; &gt; ONLY LORD GOD (THE FATHER) AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST (THE FATHER'S
&gt; &gt; SON)&quot;
&gt; &gt; (Jude 4. 1 John 2:22)

&gt; &gt; 'PAUL' CURSED JESUS CHRIST AND HIS APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES
&gt; &gt; &quot; If we or an angel from heaven preach ANY OTHER GOSPEL to you than
&gt; &gt; what we (Pauland his followers) have preached to you LET HIM BE A
&gt; &gt; CURSE&quot;
&gt; &gt; (Gal 1:18)
&gt; &gt; There was a distinction even back then with the disciples of Jesus andPauland &quot;his&quot; followers. Barnabbas and Mark both followedPaulat one
&gt; &gt; time and then left him and went back to the disciples. Barnabbas was
&gt; &gt; sent by the Apostle Peter  to travel withPauland teachPaulthe ways
&gt; &gt; and teachings of Jesus, butPaulwasn't going to play second fiddle to
&gt; &gt; anyone and  usurped the authority of Barnabbas and taught what he
&gt; &gt; wanted to teach.  How many ever knew thatPaulwas suppose to be
&gt; &gt; subservient to Barnabbas?

&gt; &gt; &quot;Indeed IPAULsay to you that IF ANYONE BECOME CIRCUMCISED Christ
&gt; &gt; will profit you nothing &quot; (Gal. 5:2).

&gt; &gt; too badPaul! The circumcision was a sign of the covenant between
&gt; &gt; Israel and Yahovah and you're lie was exposed for what it was! Anotherfalse&quot;divine revelation!&quot;

&gt; &gt; YET, despite his assertion that 'Christ will profit you nothing',
&gt; &gt; 'Paul' himself, HYPOCRITICALLY &quot; took TIMOTHY and CIRCUMCISED HIM &quot;
&gt; &gt; (Acts 16:3).

&gt; &gt; NowPauldeclares it's ok to eat meat sacrificed to idols

&gt; &gt; &quot; For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no
&gt; &gt; greater burden than THESE NECESSARY THINGS:
&gt; &gt; That you ABSTAIN FROM MEATS offered to idols, and from blood, and from
&gt; &gt; things strangled and from fornication...&quot;
&gt; &gt; (Acts 15:28:29)
&gt; &gt; &quot; But I (Jesus) have a few things against thee, because thou hast
&gt; &gt; there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast
&gt; &gt; a STUMBLING BLOCK before the children of Israel, TO EAT THINGS
&gt; &gt; SACRIFICED TO IDOLS &quot;

You wrote:&gt;&quot;First of all, it is important to know that according to
">

the New Testament itself, all of Jesus' Disciples fled for their lives
on the night of crucifixion. None of them witnessed Jesus' crucifixion
except for one, that is Saint Peter! He was the lone and only witness
of the actual crucifixion event. Let us look at what the Bible's New
Testament says: (and the context of your post on Aug 22, 11:50 pm is
available on this thread or is copied below this reply).

Your statement above is not true.  Peter stood in the courtyard
denying Jesus Christ while the OTHER disciple who led him there - the
ONLY disciple of Jesus Christ that the High Priest's servants and
guards knew well enough to let pass through their ranks with an
unknown companion without question - the ONLY disciple who was fully
accepted by the High Priest - the ONLY disciple of Jesus Christ that
had direct access to the High Priest - THAT disciple was inside with
the High Priest and the others during the torturous 'trial' of Jesus
Christ.

It wasn't Peter who stood at the cross who Jesus spoke to as he hung
by the nails pounded through his hands and feet - it was the one
referred to as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved' because THAT disciple
wasn't threatened by the High Priest OR the High Priest's servants OR
the High Priest's guards.  Read about it in John 19 verse 26.

The apostle Paul wrote approximately 65 descriptions of the Holy
Spirit that are consistent with the descriptions of the other NT
authors and the descriptions within the text of the Old Testament.
Paul praised God and God's Son.  The event on the way to Damascus as
recorded in Acts (which was written by or through the apostle Peter,
not Paul) is consistent with other events describing the presence of
God's Spirit on our planet earth.

The other apostles fully accepted Paul as a spiritual brother and
peer.  Who or what are you to claim more knowledge and/or scriptural
understanding and/or spiritual authority than the apostles of Yahushea
(Jesus Christ, Messiah, Son of Yahweh)?

&gt; 1-  The NT confirms that only Peter witnessed the crucifixion:

&gt; First of all, it is important to know that according to the New
&gt; Testament itself, all of Jesus' Disciples fled for their lives on the
&gt; night of crucifixion.  None of them witnessed Jesus' crucifixion
&gt; except for one, that is Saint Peter!  He was the lone and only
&gt; witness
&gt; of the actual crucifixion event.  Let us look at what the Bible's New
&gt; Testament says:

&gt; Matthew 26:34-35, 55-57, 69-75
&gt; 34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
&gt; before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
&gt; 35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not
&gt; deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
&gt; .......
&gt; 55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
&gt; against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily
&gt; with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
&gt; 56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
&gt; be
&gt; fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
&gt; 57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
&gt; high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
&gt; 69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
&gt; saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
&gt; 70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
&gt; sayest.
&gt; 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and
&gt; said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
&gt; Nazareth.
&gt; 72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
&gt; 73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
&gt; Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
&gt; thee.
&gt; 74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
&gt; And immediately the cock crew.
&gt; 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
&gt; Before
&gt; the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
&gt; bitterly.

&gt; Now as we clearly see, Peter did witness the so-called crucifixion
&gt; event.  He was present there.  The only thing that saved him from
&gt; death is his denial that he knew Jesus.  Otherwise, he would've got
&gt; crucified that night.

&gt; Examples of third-party narrations in the &quot;Gospels&quot; of the NT:

&gt; Let us also notice the third-party narration in the &quot;Gospel of
&gt; Matthew&quot;, and in the rest of the so-called &quot;Gospels&quot; of the New
&gt; Testament.  Here are few examples:

&gt; &gt;From www.answering-christianity.com/authors_gospels.htm:

&gt; &quot;...And as Jesus passed forth thence, HE (Jesus) saw a man, named
&gt; Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and HE (Jesus) saith unto
&gt; HIM (Matthew), follow ME (Jesus) and HE (Matthew) arose, and followed
&gt; HIM (Jesus).  (Matthew 9:9)&quot;

&gt; &quot;And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
&gt; Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? (From the King James
&gt; Version Bible, John 1:19)&quot;

&gt; &quot;John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
&gt; one among you, whom ye know not;  (From the King James Version Bible,
&gt; John 1:26)&quot;

&gt; &quot;For John was not yet cast into prison.  (From the King James Version
&gt; Bible, John 3:24)&quot;

&gt; etc.....

&gt; A lot more examples and proofs are available at:

&gt; Just who were the real authors of the Bible? Today's Books and
&gt; Gospels' authors of the Bible are UNKNOWN.  See the comments from the
&gt; NIV Bible itself!  Also includes detailed refutations and exposing of
&gt; Paul's lies.  See Paul's section in the article.  It also includes
&gt; proofs about the New Testament was written in the 3rd century by
&gt; Constantine and his church by their own words.  It wasn't written by
&gt; Jesus and his original Disciples.

&gt; Quotes from NIV Bible theologians, and Roman Catholic Encyclopedia
&gt; admitting that the Bible had been corrupt and the original
&gt; manuscripts
&gt; had been lost.  Also, proofs that it was Constantine and his church
&gt; who wrote the New Testament with their hands around year 300, not
&gt; Jesus and his original Disciples.

&gt; According to the NIV and KJV Bible's theologians, the gospels were
&gt; written by mysterious and unknown people, in unknown places and
&gt; unknown dates!

&gt; 2-   The Apocalypse of Peter was written and spoken by Peter himself!

&gt; Unlike the Gospels of the New Testament, the Apocalypse of Peter (the
&gt; Revelations sent to Peter) was directly written and spoken by Peter
&gt; himself.  This Revelation was widely accepted and believed in by the
&gt; early Christians during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries.  Also listen
&gt; to this AUDIO file from Christian theologians.   The early Christians
&gt; clearly rejected the lies of crucifixion and trinity!

&gt; Here are the fragments of his Apocalypse.

&gt; &gt;From http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/apoc/fgapcpt.htm:

&gt; (emphasis below are mine.  Pay close attention to the red ones.)

&gt; As the Savior was sitting in the temple in the three hundredth year
&gt; of
&gt; the covenant and the agreement of the tenth pillar, and being
&gt; satisfied with the number of the living, incorruptible Majesty, he
&gt; said to me (Peter),

&gt; &quot;Peter, blessed are those above belonging to the Father, who revealed
&gt; life to those who are from life, through me, since I reminded them,
&gt; they who are built on what is strong, that they may hear my word, and
&gt; distinguish words of unrighteousness and transgression of the law
&gt; from
&gt; righteousness, as being from the height of every word of this Pleroma
&gt; of truth, having been enlightened in good pleasure by him whom the
&gt; principalities sought. But they did not find him, nor was he
&gt; mentioned
&gt; among any generation of the prophets. He has now appeared among
&gt; these,
&gt; in him who appeared, who is the Son of Man who is exalted above the
&gt; heavens in fear of men of like essence. But you yourself, Peter,
&gt; become perfect in accordance with your name with myself, the one who
&gt; chose you, because from you I established a base for the remnant whom
&gt; I have summoned to knowledge. Therefore be strong until the imitation
&gt; of righteousness - of him who had summoned you, having summoned you
&gt; to
&gt; know him in a way which forth doing because of the rejection which
&gt; happened to him, and the sinews of his hands and his feet, and the
&gt; crowning by those of the middle region, and the body of his radiance
&gt; which they bringing hope of service because of a reward of honor - as
&gt; he was about to reprove you three times in this night&quot;.

&gt; And as he was saying these things I saw the priests and the people
&gt; running up to us with stones, as if they would kill us; and I was
&gt; afraid that we were going to die. And he said to me: &quot;Peter, I have
&gt; told you many times that they are blind ones who have no guide. If
&gt; you
&gt; want to know their blindness, put your hands before your eyes - your
&gt; robe - and say what you see.&quot;  But when I had done it, I did not see
&gt; anything. I said &quot;No one sees this way&quot; And he said to me, &quot;Do it
&gt; again.&quot; And there came in me fear with joy, for I saw a new light
&gt; greater than the light of day. Then it came down upon the Savior. And
&gt; I told him about those things which I saw. And he said to me again,
&gt; &quot;Lift up your hands and listen to what the priests and the people are
&gt; saying.&quot; And I listened to the priests as they sat with the scribes.
&gt; The multitudes were shouting with their voice. When he heard these
&gt; things from me he said to me &quot;prick up your ears and listen to the
&gt; things they are saying.&quot; And I listened again, &quot;As you sit, they are
&gt; praising you.&quot; And when I said these things , the Savior said &quot;I have
&gt; told you that these people are blind and deaf. Now then, listen to
&gt; the
&gt; things which they are telling you in a mystery, and guard them. Do
&gt; not
&gt; tell them to the sons of this age. For they shall blaspheme you in
&gt; these ages since they are ignorant of you, but they will praise you
&gt; in

Marriedpl,

Where is the Gospel according to Peter?  Is Paul around when Jesus was
&quot;cruxified&quot;?

Is what written about Gospel according to John true?

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN

John's Gospel is radically different from the three others; to such an
extent indeed that Father Roguet in his book Initiation to the Gospel
(Initiation à l'Evangile), having commented on the other three,
immediately evokes a startling image for the fourth. He calls it ,
different world'. It is indeed a unique book; different in the
arrangement and choice of subject, description and speech; different
in its style, geography, chronology; there are even differences in
theological outlook (O. Culmann). Jesus's words are therefore
differently recorded by John from the other evangelists: Father Roguet
notes on this that whereas the synoptics record Jesus's words in a
style that is &quot;striking, much nearer to the oral style&quot;, in John all
is meditation; to such an extent indeed that &quot;one sometimes wonders if
Jesus is still speaking or whether His ideas have not imperceptibly
been extended by the Evangelist's own thoughts&quot;.

Who was the author? This is a highly debated question and extremely
varying opinions have been expressed on this subject.

A. Tricot and Father Roguet belong to a camp that does not have the
slightest misgivings: John's Gospel is the work of an eyewitness, its
author is John, son of Zebedee and brother of James. Many details are
known about this apostle and are set out in works for mass
publication. Popular iconography puts him near Jesus, as in the Last
Supper prior to the Passion. Who could imagine that John's Gospel was
not the work of John the Apostle whose figure is so familiar?

The fact that the fourth Gospel was written so late is not a serious
argument against this opinion. The definitive version was probably
written around the end of the First century A.D. To situate the time
it was written at sixty years after Jesus would be in keeping with an
apostle who was very young at the time of Jesus and who lived to be
almost a hundred.

Father Kannengiesser, in his study on the Resurrection, arrives at the
conclusion that none of the New Testament authors, save Paul, can
claim to have been eyewitnesses to Jesus's Resurrection. John
nevertheless related the appearance to a number of the assembled
apostles, of which he was probably a member, in the absence of Thomas
(20,19-24), then eight days later to the full group of apostles
(20,25-29).

O. Culmann in his work The New Testament does not subscribe to this
view.

The Ecumenical Translation of the Bible states that the majority of
critics do not accept the hypothesis that the Gospel was written by
John, although this possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.
Everything points however towards the fact that the text we know today
had several authors: &quot;It is probable that the Gospel as it stands
today was put into circulation by the author's disciples who added
chapter 21 and very likely several annotations (i.e. 4,2 and perhaps
4,1; 4,44; 7,37b; 11,2; 19,35). With regard to the story of the
adulterous woman (7,53-8,11), everyone agrees that it is a fragment of
unknown origin inserted later (but nevertheless belonging to canonic
Scripture)&quot;. Passage 19,35 appears as a 'signature' of an
'eyewitness' (O. Culmann), the only explicit signature in the whole of
John's Gospel; but commentators believe that it was probably added
later.

O. Culmann thinks that latter additions are obvious in this Gospel;
such as chapter 21 which is probably the work of a &quot;disciple who may
well have made slight alterations to the main body of the Gospel&quot;.

It is not necessary to mention all the hypotheses suggested by experts
in exegesis. The remarks recorded here made by the most eminent
Christian writers on the questions of the authorship of the fourth
Gospel are sufficient to show the extent of the confusion reigning on
the subject of its authorship.

The historical value of John's stories has been contested to a great
extent. The discrepancy between them and the other three Gospels is
quite blatant. O. Culman offers an explanation for this; he sees in
John a different theological point of view from the other evangelists.
This aim &quot;directs the choice of stories from the Logia [ Words.]
recorded, as well as the way in which they are reproduced . . . Thus
the author often prolongs the lines and makes the historical Jesus say
what the Holy Spirit Itself revealed to Him&quot;. This, for the exegete in
question, is the reason for the discrepancies.

It is of course quite conceivable that John, who was writing after the
other evangelists, should have chosen certain stories suitable for
illustrating his own theories. One should not be surprised by the fact
that certain descriptions contained in the other Gospels are missing
in John. The Ecumenical Translation picks out a certain number of such
instances (page 282). Certain gaps hardly seem credible however, like
the fact that the Institution of the Eucharist is not described. It is
unthinkable that an episode so basic to Christianity, one indeed that
was to be the mainstay of its liturgy, i.e. the mass, should not be
mentioned by John, the most pre-eminently meditative evangelist. The
fact is, he limits himself, in the narrative of the supper prior to
the Passion, to simply describing the washing of the disciples' feet,
the prediction of Judas's betrayal and Peter's denial.

In contrast to this, there are stories which are unique to John and
not present in the other three. The Ecumenical Translation mentions
these (page 283). Here again, one could infer that the three authors
did not see the importance in these episodes that John saw in them. It
is difficult however not to be taken aback when one finds in John a
description of the appearance of Jesus raised from the dead to his
disciples beside the Sea of Tiberias (John 21,1-14). The description
is nothing less than the reproduction (with numerous added details) of
the miracle catch of fish which Luke (5,1-11) presents as an episode
that occurred during Jesus's life. In his description Luke alludes to
the presence of the Apostle John who, as tradition has it, was the
evangelist, Since this description in John's Gospel forms part of
chapter 21, agreed to be a later addition, one can easily imagine that
the reference to John's name in Luke could have led to its artificial
inclusion in the fourth Gospel. The necessity of transforming a
description from Jesus's life to a posthumous description in no way
prevented the evangelical text from being manipulated.

Another important point on which John's Gospel differs from the other
three is in the duration of Jesus's mission. Mark, Matthew and Luke
place it over a period of one year. John spreads it over two years. O.
Culmann notes this fact. On this subject the Ecumenical Translation
expresses the following .

&quot;The synoptics describe a long period in Galilee followed by a march
that was more or less prolonged towards Judea, and finally a brief
stay in Jerusalem. John, on the other hand, describes frequent
journeys from one area to another and mentions a long stay in Judea,
especially in Jerusalem (1,19-51; 2,13-3,36; 5,1-47; 14,20-31). He
mentions several Passover celebrations (2,13; 5,1; 6,4; 11,55) and
thus suggests a ministry that lasted more than two years&quot;.

Which one of them should one believe-Mark, Matthew, Luke or John?

SOURCES OF THE GOSPELS

The general outline that has been given here of the Gospels and which
emerges from a critical examination of the texts tends to make one
think of a literature which is &quot;disjointed, with a plan that lacks
continuity&quot; and &quot;seemingly insuperable contradictions&quot;. These are the
terms used in the judgement passed on them by the commentators of the
Ecumenical Translation of the Bible. It is important to refer to their
authority because the consequences of an appraisal of this subject are
extremely serious. It has already been seen how a few notions
concerning the religious history of the time when the Gospels were
written helped to explain certain disconcerting aspects of this
literature apparent to the thoughtful reader. It is necessary to
continue, however, and ascertain what present-day works can tell us
about the sources the Evangelists drew on when writing their texts. It
is also interesting to see whether the history of the texts once they
were established can help to explain certain aspects they present
today.

The problem of sources was approached in a very simplistic fashion at
the time of the Fathers of the Church. In the early centuries of
Christianity, the only source available was the Gospel that the
complete manuscripts provided first, i.e. Matthew's Gospel. The
problem of sources only concerned Mark and Luke because John
constituted a quite separate case. Saint Augustine held that Mark, who
appears second in the traditional order of presentation, had been
inspired by Matthew and had summarized his work. He further considered
that Luke, who comes third in the manuscripts, had used data from
both; his prologue suggests this, and has already been discussed.

The experts in exegesis at this period were as able as we are to
estimate the degree of corroboration between the texts and find a
large number of verses common to two or three synoptics. Today, the
commentators of the Ecumenical Translation of the Bible provide the
following figures:

verses common to all three synoptics -------------- 330
verses common to Mark and Matthew ------------ 178
verses common to Mark and Luke ----------------100
verses common to Matthew and Luke ------------ 230

The verses unique to each of the first three Gospels are as follows:
Matthew 330, Mark 53, and Luke 500.

arah,

You wrote in your post Aug 28, 3:24 pm &quot;The conclusion to be drawn
from the above is that when we read the Gospel, we can no longer be at
all sure that we are reading Jesus's word.&quot;

Oh yes we can!  The author of the document you reference in your post
and the men he references did not recognize the relationships or
patterns that exist within the book of John.  They discarded or
overlooked the insights of the author of John that explains the
relationships that are captured there.  Some of these men made
statements of truth that they could not know and you took their
opinions and twisted them.  If the author of the book of John is
indeed the apostle John (who it probably is), then John would have
been privy to the most intimate details and inner thoughts of Jesus
Christ.  Indeed, the book of John provides intimate details of people
that ONLY those people he wrote about could provide.

The book of John was authored by one person and validated by many.
John 21:24 states: &quot;...We know that his testimony is true.&quot;  Who are the
'We'?  Those that were named in his book.  How did they know it was
true?  They lived it - they were there.  They (the 'We') were
participants of the truth written into this wonderful book and they
witnessed to the truth of the document. The 'We' would have verified
the accuracy of what was written by the author to ensure that the
final document would present an unbiased and true accounting of his
testimony to the world.  The fact that the book of John was written
after the other gospels fully supports what I just wrote.  John lived
to be very old and his 'book' would have been in transit for many
years as it moved back and forth to and through those that lived it.
The final document would have had been a perfectly validated
document.  Each accounting would have had two people or more that
witnessed and/or participated in each of the events that is described.

John provides structured timelines and fully supports the other
gospels by explaining or filling in the gaps.  Even what is omitted
from the book of John provides information and scriptural
understanding when placed alongside the other gospels.

The book of John is an incredibly radiant light of truth that provides
God's children with, in all essence, a picture of the tree of life.

You, arah, are working very hard to discredit the writings of the New
Testament.  Your posts are placed before the world to confuse and
distract.  Nothing of what you have presented holds water because the
cisterns that you and those before you have dug are broken.  In this
thread you reject the writings of the apostle Paul and now you reject
the author of the book of John and the rest of the Gospels.  In doing
so you reject Jesus Christ.

In my post to you on this thread on Aug, 27 4:411 pm I made an
observation and asked you a question that no longer needs a reply.  I
wrote: &quot;The other apostles fully accepted Paul as a spiritual brother
and peer. Who or what are you to claim more knowledge and/or
scriptural understanding and/or spiritual authority than the apostles
of Yahushua (Jesus Christ, Messiah, Son of God, Son of Yahweh)?&quot;

You have answered the question.

The New Testament is the final chapter of the story of the tree of
life. It is the shoot that spans the river of the water of life.
Revelation 22 verses 1 and 2 state:  &quot;Then the angel showed me the
river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the
throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of
the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing
twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves
of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&quot;

It is only through Yahushua (Jesus Christ) and the Spirit that God's
children are able to access the fruit of the tree of life.  Scripture
cannot be understood by man and the record of Genesis 3 explains why.
Yahweh (God) provides us safe passage back to His holy city through
the authority and example of His Son Jesus Christ.  Only Jesus Christ
has the authority to make the guard to the east step aside so that we
may pass and eat the fruit of the tree of life.  The pages of the
bible are for the healing of His children.

And you, arah, are trying desperately to lead Yahweh's children away
from Him.

Yahushua did not come to judge the world but to save it.  It is not my
position to judge you.  All I can do is warn you and offer you life.
Our Father God created us to hold His water of life, but we can only
hold His water through the work of His Son.

Woe be unto you arah for though you are benefiting greatly from the
great blessings that Yahweh has poured out on all mankind in these end
times, if you continue on this path you will never pass the guard to
the east and you will be forever kept in the place where all of
Yahweh's blessings no longer exist.  You can choose Yahushua and
experience the life Yahweh wants you to live or continue to turn your
back to him and be forever separated from your creator.

All of us were created to make this choice.

Shalom,
Ray

&gt; been extended by the Evangelist's own thoughts&quot;.

&gt; Who was the author? This is a highly debated question and extremely
&gt; varying opinions have been expressed on this subject.

&gt; A. Tricot and Father Roguet belong to a camp that does not have the
&gt; slightest misgivings: John's Gospel is the work of an eyewitness, its
&gt; author is John, son of Zebedee and brother of James. Many details are
&gt; known about this apostle and are set out in works for mass
&gt; publication. Popular iconography puts him near Jesus, as in the Last
&gt; Supper prior to the Passion. Who could imagine that John's Gospel was
&gt; not the work of John the Apostle whose figure is so familiar?

&gt; The fact that the fourth Gospel was written so late is not a serious
&gt; argument against this opinion. The definitive version was probably
&gt; written around the end of the First century A.D. To situate the time
&gt; it was written at sixty years after Jesus would be in keeping with an
&gt; apostle who was very young at the time of Jesus and who lived to be
&gt; almost a hundred.

&gt; Father Kannengiesser, in his study on the Resurrection, arrives at the
&gt; conclusion that none of the New Testament authors, save Paul, can
&gt; claim to have been eyewitnesses to Jesus's Resurrection. John
&gt; nevertheless related the appearance to a number of the assembled
&gt; apostles, of which he was probably a member, in the absence of Thomas
&gt; (20,19-24), then eight days later to the full group of apostles
&gt; (20,25-29).

Hi R L Measures,

I'll try to answer.

My study of the book of John points to the character and spiritual
maturity of the author.  The structure of this great work and the
amount of information contained within it tells me that many people
worked on it. Someone had to initiate it and the relationships I've
found and the understanding of what I've read points to the apostle
John.

I feel that the apostle John wrote an initial draft and sent it around
the lands to the participants of his witness to verify and change or
clarify what he had remembered.  I feel the author of this book was
John but it very well could have been one, possibly two others.  Who I
think it could be isn't important.  What is important is that this
book could not have been completed in its present form by only one
person.

I think John authored it and those he either named or were with those
he named participated in what we have today.  I also think that there
was much more in his initial draft that had to be removed because of
lack of two or more witnesses.  This is an incredible and beautiful
work.  There is much more it contains than our first read.

Did I correctly address your question/statement?

Ray

&gt; Hi R L Measures,

&gt; I'll try to answer.

&gt; My study of the book of John points to the character and spiritual
&gt; maturity of the author.  The structure of this great work and the
&gt; amount of information contained within it tells me that many people
&gt; worked on it. Someone had to initiate it and the relationships I've

&gt; lack of two or more witnesses.  This is an incredible and beautiful
&gt; work.  There is much more it contains than our first read.

&gt; Did I correctly address your question/statement?
">

**  I don't know.
The core act of worship, Eucharist [thanksgiving] in Christian churches
was, according to Mark, in Chapter 14, instituted at the &quot;Last Supper&quot;
during Jewish Passover. The year was c.29. Bread and wine were allegedly
consecrated and consumed to commemorate the impending death of the Son of
man. The commemoration of this event provides the major obligation to
compel modern Christians to attend church. However, Mark did not attend
the Last Supper. One who did attend was the disciple John, who reports on
the last meal together without mentioning any reference to wine and bread
as having special properties. Neither the Gospel of Thomas, Didache: 9-10
(2nd century) or the Q Gospel mention anything about ritual consumption of
wine and bread.  Is it likely that these authors of early Christian
writings, including words attributed to one of the 12 original disciples,
would forget to mention an event that forms the core of present day
Christian dogma?
Another inconsistency involves remittance/absolution/forgiveness of sin.
In the Sermon on the Mount, the rabbi who called himself the Son of man
states that forgiveness of sin depends on forgiving the sins of others --

Matt.: 5:14 - 15.  &quot;For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you.  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your hevenly Father forgive you.&quot;

However, this evaporates the power supply of holy men. Yet at John, 20:
23--within a few hundred words of the end of the Four Gospels -- the Son
of man allegedly reverses himself 180º and the power to absolve sins is
turned over to holy men. This strange twist is not surprising when one
realizes that the book of John was exclusively in the hands of holy men
who lived with holy men for many centuries before publication.  The
opportunity and the motivation for making certain adjustments was
certainly there.

I appreciate your response. I read it yesterday and your words have
been in my thoughts since.

Your are both right and wrong - I'll explain:

Christ left no written word but even if he did would you still make
the same statement?  You would be correct if you did.  Please don't
misunderstand me - your observations are valid and what you have
expressed is good.

Some synonyms of the word 'interpret' are: take, take to mean,
construe, infer, and read between the lines.  I understand a meaning
of the word 'interpret' as a formulated guess. In our everyday lives
we interpret things hopefully to help us understand how to make the
right decisions.

Teaching an interpretation of anything isn't wrong as long as the
student is aware that their teachers interpretation is only a
formulated guess.  This means that the student should evaluate the
information of their teachers to gain an understanding of what is
right and what is not.  If we don't understand what is right then how
can we know that our teachers are right?

If there is no understanding then all that is left is confusion.

tell you.

Yes there is.  Look for consistency in what is written in scripture.
Consistency exists from the first word of Genesis to the last word of
Revelation, I have found it.

Before I found consistency in the word I first had to trust that the
offer of salvation through Jesus Christ was real.  Before I was 29 the
words of scripture were meaningless to me.  It was through a non-
denominational bible study a friend invited me to that I began
understanding.  I was not taught doctrine there but instead was
encouraged to study the word to understand it personally.  We had
group discussions where everyone shared what we understood from the
homework we had and all of us learned from each other.  This was an
interpretation friendly environment that included Christians from all
denominations and non-denominations (and people like me - non-
Christians).   I eventually understood that in order to understand
scripture I had to live it and the only example I had was what was
written about Christ.

Blind faith in what someone tells us is wrong and there is great
danger there, but faith leading to understanding always leads us to
better lives.

know.... but quite another to hear the various interpretations of the
historians who never knew Christ, yet be so clueless as to assume
those interpretations are based in fact.&quot;

There are many people trying to prove or disprove the validity of the
bible today as yesterday.  Some archeologists look to the physical
ruins of man's history to provide proof that what is written is valid.
Scientists study the far reaches of our universe and the elements
looking to prove or disprove scripture.   Other people look in
scripture and try to find points of conflict to prove that the bible
isn't valid.

How does someone know if something is true or not?  The answer is by
trying to understand it.  In the case of Christianity, it first means
trust.

I trusted and I understood a little, and when I believed I began
understanding much more.  I learned that I had to live the words in
order to understand them.  I think most Christians who trust and
believe never go any further than blindly accepting what others tell
them is true.

I have learned that the proof of scripture lays on the table of
understanding of what is being communicated to us and what is
communicated goes beyond the definitions of mans words. This is why
man cannot understand scripture on his own.  Only the Spirit opens the
meaning of scripture for our understanding.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

always be doubt.&quot;

Doubt is good when it fosters a hunger for understanding.  Jesus
Christ calls for us to understand scripture with our hearts and turn
to God and when we do, we will be healed.  To understand with our
hearts we need to pray for the instructions and guidance of the Spirit
and actively seek to live what we are learning.

Revelation 22:2 addresses the tree of life.  It says &quot;On each side of
the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit,
yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the
healing of the nations.

I've learned from my studies that trees as described in scripture have
double meanings in essentially every verse.  Trees are metaphors used
to describe or project sources or resources.  For reasons that I've
shared elsewhere in this thread, I submit that the 'tree of life' is
the bible, and the leaves of the tree' in verse 2 are the pages of
scripture and that 'the nations' describes all of God's spiritual
children.  It's an understanding I share for your evaluation.

Hi Ray,

I cannot begin to explain how much I love this.  Concerning the book
of John,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
You wrote: &gt;**  &quot;Why couldn't several scribes have authored it ?&quot;  **
">

&quot;Is The Gospel According to John written in the first person?&quot; and
then you offered this information: **  Many biblical scholars think
that several scribes interviewed a number of people who heard John
speak and wrote down what they were told by the interviewees. This
helps to explain the syntax shifts.

I will try to answer your very good questions/observations.

There are several reasons I am convinced that the book of John is
written in the first person.  One example is found in John 4 when
Jesus Christ is speaking with the woman at the well.  John wrote:
6Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey,
sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.  7When a Samaritan
woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, &quot;Will you give me a
drink?&quot; 8(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)

This verse (among others) opens windows of understanding for different
records of this and the other gospels.  Many people look at this verse
and think that all of his disciples left to buy food but this is not
true.  John didn't say that all of Jesus' disciples had left only that
some of them had left.  At least two of them remained to capture the
event and one of them would have been John.  Perhaps the other was his
brother James.  As an example you are sitting sit at a table with many
of your friends and some of them leave.  An observer could truthfully
say that your friends left the table.  Look at everything in the book
of John written in parenthesis - these are verses added for
understanding.  Some explain events that happen later, some are
included later to explain the earlier events.  Some share intimate
information that only the person John wrote of would know and this
includes Jesus, Peter, and Judas Iscariot.

Another reason is this:  I understand from my studies that John was
Jesus' closest and dearest friend.  The omission of the events at the
garden of Gethsemane in the gospel of John would have been intentional
due to confidential information Jesus shared with John while Peter and
James slept.  Note in the other gospels that Jesus found his disciples
sleeping and reflect back on what I just shared about John 4:8.  Jesus
took his three closest chosen disciples with him to the garden to
pray.  Only two would have to be sleeping for their records to be
true.  Who would have given testimony of the events in the garden if
all of them had been asleep?  John witnessed the event, and Jesus
Christ validated his testimony.

I can see where Jesus gave John instructions to carry out after Jesus
was arrested and taken away.  The disciples would be frightened and
hurting and wouldn't understand and Jesus would have made this
provision for them.  John knew and understood who and what Jesus was
and he understood what had to take place.  After the resurrection
Jesus was truly the Son of God and yet the before his crucifixion and
physical death the Son of man truly needed a friend and confidant.  I
see that out of all of the Twelve, John was the most mature and I can
see that John was this friend.

There is so much more information contained within this book that has
been hidden since it was written.  John develops the character above
all of the other disciples for a very good reason.  In fact, the
character of Peter is portrayed in all of the gospels more than the
other disciples and John finishes the picture.  It helps us understand
the rest of the story.  I'll have to address some of the other reasons
later.  There's just too much to share in one post.

About the forgiveness of sins:  Jesus breathed into them the Holy
Spirit.  When He did this they became the first of His spiritual
brothers.  It is not man who forgives sins, it is the Spirit of God
that forgives the sins.  Before the resurection only Jesus was filled
with the Spirit.  It was through the disciples true belief in Jesus
Christ and their confession to others by their acts of emulating Jesus
Christ that He took their broken cisterns that could not hold water
and made them new.  When God filled them with His living water in Acts
2, their bodies held the water and it flowed from them out into the
world.

It is important to understand that these men were given a gift beyond
any other man before or after their time.  Jesus gave them his
authority and they had the understanding of the Spirit of God.  They
were filled with the Spirit of God just as Jesus Christ was - they
raised people from physical death and healed the injured, disabled and
sick.  These men did things through the power given to them by Jesus
Christ that no other men have done before or after them.  No man has
the authority to forgive sins, but the spiritual children of God
through their indwelling of the Holy Spirit do.

I need to stop for the moment.  I will get back to the rest of your
post shortly.  I want to share insight on the bread and water.

Shalom,
Ray

&gt; 2, their bodies held the water and it flowed from them out into the
&gt; world.

&gt; It is important to understand that these men were given a gift beyond
&gt; any other man before or after their time.  Jesus gave them his
&gt; authority and they had the understanding of the Spirit of God.  They
&gt; were filled with the Spirit of God just as Jesus Christ was - they
&gt; raised people from physical death and healed the injured, disabled and
&gt; sick.  These men did things through the power given to them by Jesus
&gt; Christ that no other men have done before or after them.  No man has
&gt; the authority to forgive sins, but the spiritual children of God
&gt; through their indwelling of the Holy Spirit do.

&gt; I need to stop for the moment.  I will get back to the rest of your
&gt; post shortly.  I want to share insight on the bread and water.

&gt; Shalom,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi R L Measures,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll try to answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My study of the book of John points to the character and spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; maturity of the author.  The structure of this great work and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; amount of information contained within it tells me that many people
&gt; &gt; &gt; worked on it. Someone had to initiate it and the relationships I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; found and the understanding of what I've read points to the apostle
&gt; &gt; &gt; John.

&gt; &gt; **  Why couldn't several scribes have authored it ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that the apostle John wrote an initial draft and sent it around
&gt; &gt; &gt; the lands to the participants of his witness to verify and change or
&gt; &gt; &gt; clarify what he had remembered.  I feel the author of this book was
&gt; &gt; &gt; John but it very well could have been one, possibly two others.  Who I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think it could be isn't important.  What is important is that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; book could not have been completed in its present form by only one
&gt; &gt; &gt; person.

&gt; &gt; **   Is The Gospel According to John written in the first person ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think John authored it

&gt; &gt; **  Many biblical scholars think that several scribes interviewed a number
&gt; &gt; of people who heard John speak and wrote down what they were told by the
&gt; &gt; interviewees.  This helps to explain the syntax shifts. =20

&gt; &gt; ?and those he either named or were with those

&gt; &gt; &gt; he named participated in what we have today.  I also think that there
&gt; &gt; &gt; was much more in his initial draft that had to be removed because of
&gt; &gt; &gt; lack of two or more witnesses.  This is an incredible and beautiful
&gt; &gt; &gt; work.  There is much more it contains than our first read.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Did I correctly address your question/statement?

&gt; &gt; **  I don't know. =20
&gt; &gt;  The core act of worship, Eucharist [thanksgiving] in Christian churches
&gt; &gt; was, according to Mark, in Chapter 14, instituted at the &quot;Last Supper&quot;
&gt; &gt; during Jewish Passover. The year was c.29. Bread and wine were allegedly
&gt; &gt; consecrated and consumed to commemorate the impending death of the Son of
&gt; &gt; man. The commemoration of this event provides the major obligation to
&gt; &gt; compel modern Christians to attend church. However, Mark did not attend
&gt; &gt; the Last Supper. One who did attend was the disciple John, who reports on
&gt; &gt; the last meal together without mentioning any reference to wine and bread
&gt; &gt; as having special properties. Neither the Gospel of Thomas, Didache: 9-10
&gt; &gt; (2nd century) or the Q Gospel mention anything about ritual consumption of
&gt; &gt; wine and bread.  Is it likely that these authors of early Christian
&gt; &gt; writings, including words attributed to one of the 12 original disciples,
&gt; &gt; would forget to mention an event that forms the core of present day
&gt; &gt; Christian dogma?
&gt; &gt;   Another inconsistency involves remittance/absolution/forgiveness of sin.
&gt; &gt; In the Sermon on the Mount, the rabbi who called himself the Son of man
&gt; &gt; states that forgiveness of sin depends on forgiving the sins of others --

&gt; &gt; Matt.: 5:14 - 15.  &quot;For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
&gt; &gt; Father will also forgive you.  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
&gt; &gt; neither will your hevenly Father forgive you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; However, this evaporates the power supply of holy men. Yet at John, 20:
&gt; &gt; 23--within a few hundred words of the end of the Four Gospels -- the Son
&gt; &gt; of man allegedly reverses himself 180=BA and the power to absolve sins is
&gt; &gt; turned over to holy men. This strange twist is not surprising when one
&gt; &gt; realizes that the book of John was exclusively in the hands of holy men
&gt; &gt; who lived with holy men for many centuries before publication.  The
&gt; &gt; opportunity and the motivation for making certain adjustments was
&gt; &gt; certainly there.

&gt; David,

&gt; I appreciate your response. I read it yesterday and your words have
&gt; been in my thoughts since.

&gt; You wrote: &gt; &quot;Hogwash. Christ left no written word, and 2000 years of
&gt; twisting and turning the interpretations of spiritual writings to suit
&gt; the needs of the interpreter, leaves this quotation as a foredrawn
&gt; conclusion.&quot;

&gt; Your are both right and wrong - I'll explain:

&gt; Christ left no written word but even if he did would you still make
&gt; the same statement?
">

That would be impossible... but it would be warranted had those
writings been in a language of antiquity that passed through dozens
if not hundreds of human interpretations along the way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You would be correct if you did.  Please don't
&gt; misunderstand me - your observations are valid and what you have
&gt; expressed is good.

&gt; Some synonyms of the word 'interpret' are: take, take to mean,
&gt; construe, infer, and read between the lines.  I understand a meaning
&gt; of the word 'interpret' as a formulated guess. In our everyday lives
&gt; we interpret things hopefully to help us understand how to make the
&gt; right decisions.

&gt; Teaching an interpretation of anything isn't wrong as long as the
&gt; student is aware that their teachers interpretation is only a
&gt; formulated guess.  This means that the student should evaluate the
&gt; information of their teachers to gain an understanding of what is
&gt; right and what is not.  If we don't understand what is right then how
&gt; can we know that our teachers are right?

&gt; If there is no understanding then all that is left is confusion.
">

All of this makes wonderful sense to me.  I appreciate the comments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You wrote: &gt; &quot;There is no earthly way that anyone can be &quot;sure&quot; of
&gt; anything that is left in the holy scriptures, let alone the hear-say
&gt; known as the words of the Christ himself, hence such a great need for
&gt; 'faith' in stomaching whatever the interpreter of the day chooses to
&gt; tell you.
&gt; Yes there is.  Look for consistency in what is written in scripture.
&gt; Consistency exists from the first word of Genesis to the last word of
&gt; Revelation, I have found it.
">

Ouch.   ;-)     You were right there with me, including understanding my
reasoning for holding questions of the written word.... and suddenly you
fall back on total acceptance, no questions asked, of perfect symmetry
throughout all of the remaining books of the Bible.   I don't get it....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Before I found consistency in the word I first had to trust that the
&gt; offer of salvation through Jesus Christ was real.
">

Salvation is in your heart.  Jesus is a marvelous parable to aid in
reflecting what is in your heart, as are many of the books of the
Bible.  Some, however, are obviously a complete cacophony of
gibberish... leaving no alternatives other than supposition.  Salvation
is nothing more than the admission (or acceptance, if you will) that
the Spirit continues after it leaves the shell which walks this earth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I eventually understood that in order to understand
&gt; scripture I had to live it and the only example I had was what was
&gt; written about Christ.
">

The parts that claim God to be full of wrath, vengeance, and willingness
top dole out death on a grand scale are enough to make me disbelieve
portions of the so-called &quot;holy&quot; scriptures.  I've also noticed, that the further
forward in time we move with translations and interpretations (re-writing,
re-printing, and re-simplifying the language) of the Bible, the more evil it
seems to become.  &lt;just an observation&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Blind faith in what someone tells us is wrong and there is great

Agreed.  Faith in yourself is of prime importance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You wrote: &gt; &quot;It's one thing to listen to your heart, to be still and

&gt; historians who never knew Christ, yet be so clueless as to assume
&gt; those interpretations are based in fact.&quot;

&gt; There are many people trying to prove or disprove the validity of the
&gt; bible today as yesterday.  Some archeologists look to the physical
&gt; ruins of man's history to provide proof that what is written is valid.
&gt; Scientists study the far reaches of our universe and the elements
&gt; looking to prove or disprove scripture.   Other people look in
&gt; scripture and try to find points of conflict to prove that the bible
&gt; isn't valid.

It's a wonderfull collection of short stories and stories of people
who underwent strong spritual experiences and religious revelations.
It contains great parables to illustrate right and wrong... an intriguing
collection of works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How does someone know if something is true or not?  The answer is

Hmmm....   you sound like the typical evangelist who wants some money
for a new car.    ;-)    &quot;Trust me, and I'll show you eternity.&quot;  Not a hard

There are many steps in programming.... role play is just one of them.

Please, don't get me wrong.  I understand your point, but you're
really not altering the fact that the truth is in your heart and you
need very little prodding before it emerges to serve you.  If you
were to tell yourself at the end of every day that you must lead a
righteous life of spreading goodness and love in everything you do;
and you wake up in the morning and forgave yourself and everyone
you have encountered for everything you and they had ever done
that was less than perfect, you would become a saint in short order.
No reading required.  &lt;g&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think most Christians who trust and
&gt; believe never go any further than blindly accepting what others tell
&gt; them is true.
">

Agreed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have learned that the proof of scripture lays on the table of
&gt; understanding of what is being communicated to us and what is
&gt; communicated goes beyond the definitions of mans words. This is why
&gt; man cannot understand scripture on his own.  Only the Spirit opens the
&gt; meaning of scripture for our understanding.
">

Hmmmmmmm....    very well, though we differ there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You wrote: &gt; &quot;Sorry... but where ever man has set his hand, there must
&gt; always be doubt.&quot;

&gt; Doubt is good when it fosters a hunger for understanding.  Jesus
&gt; Christ calls for us to understand scripture with our hearts and turn
&gt; to God and when we do, we will be healed.
">

Jesus said that the written word would always be distorted, and that
one must look within their own soul to see the truth of the one Father.
(Just thought I'd remind you of that).  And since God is within us all,
one really doesn't have to look too far.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've learned from my studies that trees as described in scripture have
&gt; double meanings in essentially every verse.  Trees are metaphors used
&gt; to describe or project sources or resources.  For reasons that I've
&gt; shared elsewhere in this thread, I submit that the 'tree of life' is
&gt; the bible, and the leaves of the tree' in verse 2 are the pages of
&gt; scripture and that 'the nations' describes all of God's spiritual
&gt; children.  It's an understanding I share for your evaluation.
">

There really isn't the time...  but in my humble opinion, the 'tree' of life
is the very genetic structure of all life.  ALL life and ALL physical things,
from the moving atoms in the stone to the strand of DNA, to the molecules
of air and beyond.  Life isn't that difficult to accept, and neither is death...
and I lean a great deal toward the metaphysical, so our interpretations
are bound to be slightly different in nature.   The one thing that isn't all
that different, is that they should lead to the same ultimate understanding
that each and every human being has a part of the Holy Spirit within.

Yep, but the bible is very confusing in that respect most significantly in
English.  I think the oral tradition of the Elohim is older than that of
Yahweh especially once he adopted Israel (or did they adopt him?).

I think in a way that colp is right in that there were two different
covenants although the second was with Moses and company.  Damn, now I am
going to have to go back to the Hebrew to see who is on first.

Saul-Paul is that his purpose was to meddle the teachings of the itinerant

first response is 'clueless' and you say your name isn't Ray in a
mocking way yet you signed your response to me on Aug 29, 10:34 pm

&gt; &gt; &gt; •  My name is not Ray.  There's no perhaps about it.

&gt; &gt; OK, I rest as the 'clueless' one tonight....
&gt; •  Wow, you're up late -- or maybe that's a we're up late.  My take on
&gt; Saul-Paul is that his purpose was to meddle the teachings of the itinerant
&gt; rabbi who called himself the Son of man.  Over the years, I have observed
&gt; that a number of reprobates are guys who change the name their mom and dad
&gt; gave them. .

&gt; cheers, D. M.

I work nights, sleep early day.  Sometimes I post, others I only read, and
yet at other times I find myself to agitated to think straight enough to post.
I find that all too often I am inclined to press or judge others for their innate
and unquestioning acceptance of various interpretations of ancient sprirtual
writings, and my presence then becomes an irritation or I am misconstrued
as being less than spiritual.  Actually, I find this a very tough place to hang
out, although for some reason it's compelling for me to see the often sad
clinging to religious dogma and how deeply it controls some people. Oddly,
those most affected seem to be the ones with the least 'Christian' attitude
(by teachings that I understand) or the least spiritual in words and actions.
It's difficult not to simply drop into large number of threads and accuse
certain posters of irrationality, but I know that I don't have the time to enter
a conversation for a long enough period to substantiate my feelings, nor
would it be worth the effort to attempt to alter dozens of years of apparent
brainwashing... and I will not resort to using the Bible as a foundation for
my arguments, which in the minds of most here would disqualify my
input.
