Bought a very cheap (1 cent!) item on ebay today. The auction stated:
Shipping costs: Check item description and payment instructions or
contact seller for details.

Nothing in the description regarding shipping.

Got the invoice, $16 &quot;flat rate&quot; shipping!!!

I know, my fault for not emailing the seller I guess. FYI, this item
is an old Mallory UHF converter that I wanted only for the case. Will
become a nixie tube clock.

For the record, I had bid 9 cents.

I was prepared for $7 to maybe $9 shipping... but $16??? I did gripe a
bit as I made the payment. No response yet.

Maybe I'm just torqued because the shipping is 1600 times the closing
price... but I don't think I'm out of line. I've never charged a penny
over the actual shipping costs for an item I've sold... every bit of
packaging recycled/reused. No charge for my time, handling, tape,
nuthin'. All gratis.

In my opinion, &quot;flat rate&quot; shipping is just another way for sellers to
line their pockets with unjustified charges.

At the very least, ebay ought to require that &quot;flat rate&quot; charges be
disclosed up front.

Your thoughts?

Terry

Seems like everyone heavily pads shipping on ebay these days, but it's not
rocket science why. Ebay skims a portion of the bid price, but not the
shipping, so they sell the items dirt cheap and make the profit with the
shipping.

For me to ship from here (basically a San Francisco zip code) to the middle
of the country (random zip code 45014) costs $15.85 for a 5 lb. parcel
(seems reasonable for something like your converter) via Priority mail (I
don't ship anything but Priority) and would be $10.50 for Parcel Post, which
may never arrive.  To send the same parcel to NYC, it seems it would cost
exactly the same.

Terry,

It will probably take most of that 16 bucks to pack and ship it.   I don't
think you got ripped off.  It is just the proportions are awkward.   It has
to go parcel post (doesn't it).  I don't think it will pass as a first class
letter.

But once you receive it all will be answered.

The other day, I received a radio in a box this converter would easily
fit in, the postage was $7.xx , under $8. Now the converter might be a
little heavier... we'll see.

A guy has been sending transistor radios to me in the mail for repair .
They are in a priority box ..looks 6`` square .

First box here had 2 radios . 8$
I sent the same box with the same contents back 11$  .
Next box came , same guy 5$

Neither of us care less about the 10 bucks or whatever just interesting
how the prices are pulled out of air like that . Must be an elbow on the
scale somewhere :-)

Hi Terry,
Nice converter, are you building a 4 or 6 digit clock to go inside?

I can't believe the number of threads we have here complaining about
shipping -- usually how things get broken, this time the cost.

I don't know the size or weight of the converter box, but I can tell you
that I have a standard shipping charge here of $16 for shipping a car radio.
This is based on a cost of $14 for the actual shipment, and $2 for
materials.

Most people consider it fair, but once in awhile someone gripes about the
price.  This is usually the same person who shipped it to me in some crappy
box that was too small, with a couple blocks of styrofoam for packing.  He
doesn't take into account the fact that I had to hit the radio with an air
compressor to blow out all the styrofoam particles (who says it doesn't snow
in Florida?), and then repaired his broken volume control and bent back his
tuning shaft, all without charge.

I once had somebody pack a radio into a USPS &quot;Flat Rate&quot; box, with another
flat rate box folded up inside with the radio, and a note that said &quot;Use
this to return the radio when finished.&quot;  The box was too small and the
radio was damaged.  I made it very clear that I don't do that.

While on the subject, I laugh sometimes at the materials people use to pack
things in.  Sometimes shredded paper, which has very poor cushioning
qualities and adds a lot of weight.  I recently had somebody ship me two
radios -- individually boxed, inside a larger box, and all of it wrapped
with several layers of fabric.  Yes, they were well-packed and the radios
arrived safely, but the dang thing was so heavy that I had to weigh it --
yep!  The boxes and packing were heavier than the two radios!  It would've
been cheaper to pay the UPS Store to pack it!

what I have done in several of these cases is to send the seller their penny
via paypal, tell them to keep the item.

that usually results in them wanting to offer a better shipping rate - if
nothing else, you have the pleasure of costing them more than  you paid in
paypal fees.

Intact new rolls of one of the fluffy brands might not make bad
packing material, but would wind up more expensive than bubblewrap.

According to eBay, you can't get out of the deal because of unexpected shipping

&gt; Your thoughts?

Basic rules of *buying* on eBay:

1. Never bid more than you are willing to pay for a brown paper bag
containing only miscellaneous parts that may or may not resemble the
picture in the listing.
2. There will very nearly _ALWAYS_ be another one.
3. Always ask about shipping costs.
4. Always instruct the seller how you want it shipped. And through
eBay, not through regular e-mail - get it ON THE RECORD.
5. Pay by either USPS money order or PayPal. Both have legal remedies
in case of fraud that checks and cash do not have.

Basic rules about *selling* on eBay:

1. Be scrupulously honest in the description.
2. Brevity may be the soul of wit, but long, flowery, elaborate (but
honest) descriptions increase traffic on eBay.
3. Many pictures are better than few pictures.
4. Disclose shipping options and costs. eBay provides calculators for
that, even internationally. But restate in the description.
5. *ALWAYS* Ship Insured and with some sort of tracking or delivery
confirmation. You need to be able to prove when an item was shipped
and when it was received.
6. Never ship &quot;surface&quot; internationally. Even to Canada. Make that
clear to any buyer.

It is perfectly acceptable to have &quot;flat-rate&quot; shipping, as long as it
is right-up-front. It is perfectly acceptable to limit shipping
options, as above. And it is perfectly acceptable to have &quot;handling
charges&quot; - for example, if I ship a $50 item insured and with delivery
confirmation, that costs ~$2.00 over the calculated shipping costs via
USPS. So a $2.00 handling fee is not out of line.

I just had a buyer tell me on Sunday that a package had not arrived
(shipped 10/4). When I supplied the insurance and delivery
confirmation, the story changed in a relative instant. I would like to
think it was a genuine 'oops' - but I am glad that I followed my
general habit when dealing with unknown buyers - get confirmation.
$2.00 well spent (by the buyer as it happens).

Well, for me eBay is a way of selling off those items that are *just*
better than Free Monday material, but not quite good enough to wait
long enough for the next Kutztown. And on the buying side, a place to
bottom-fish.

Nope. For whatever reasons, air packages are handled far more gently
than ground packages. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that air
packages may get X-rayed and sniffed, but they are seldom opened.

Put another way, 100% of those packages I shipped ground to Canada
were raped and pillaged. By pure blind luck, none were damaged. 100%
of those I received by ground from Canada were similarly abused, one
was so poorly repacked that it arrived with parts missing and
irrepairable even by heroic means. Naturally the shipper blamed
Customs and rightfully so. Even though they accepted it back from
Customs, the original packing was quite complex due to the item and
the &quot;outside&quot; looked just fine although most of the inside protection
material was not replaced. Attempting to claim from Customs went
nowhere.

0% of those sent or received by air were visibly opened or damaged.

Back to the original statement.  You are obliged to complete the
transaction, period.     That doesn't say that you have to accept the
item but the &quot;transaction&quot; includes a shipping price or pick-up only
price or whatever and thats what you obligate yourself to when you hit
the BUY button.  It is presumed that you have read the details of the
auction and agreed to any shipping arrangements.

Now if the seller tacks on something unreasonable AFTER you made your
agreement then thats a different sack of snakes.

These guys that sell things like memory cards for 9.99 and charge $25
shipping are clearly skirting the ebay rules...to the extent that they
can get by with it.  But if you knowingly agree to it as a buyer then
there's not much of a legal leg to stand on.

&gt; no, that is a very misleading statement - you are obligated to pay for the item.

It's called the eBay User Agreement.  When you join eBay, you are obligated to follow
it's rules.  Each time you bid, you are told that a high bid is a binding contract,
that you must follow through with.  You are warned repeatedly on the site to check
the shipping with the seller if it isn't listed in the description before bidding, as
your bid, if high, will be entering you into a binding contract.

It's this simple:  Follow the rules you've agreed to by joining eBay and placing
bids.  Why is that so hard to understand?

If it was a matter of law, ordinance, city code etc, common law applies.

If it's part of a contractual agreement between two parties, it's
limited only by the imagination of the originating  lawyer that wrote
the thing.

Where do all these arm chair lawyers come from Jim?

contract.

But isn't that binding contract a contract to purchase the item? Where does
paying to have it shipped come in? Simply reminding the bidder to confirm
shipping costs in and of itself has nothing to do with requiring the buyer
to take posession.

Someone else suggested that taking possession of a purchased item was part
of contract law. Is it? And if so, where did it come from?

Because you haven't made any connection between buying the item and shipping
it. Where does it say this in eBay's rules?

The binding contract is for both parties to obey.  The buyer pays for the item and
shipping, the seller delivers the item to the buyer.  Obviously the shipping is
included, or eBay wouldn't be telling you over and over that it does.

Only if the seller wants to agree to letting the buyer off the hook is there a mutual
consensus to void the contract.  The buyer can't unilaterally end his obligation.

Because everywhere you try to bid, eBay reminds you to check the shipping cost, as it
is part of your total obligation.

Maybe you need a new nickname.  &quot;Brick Wall&quot; comes to mind.
