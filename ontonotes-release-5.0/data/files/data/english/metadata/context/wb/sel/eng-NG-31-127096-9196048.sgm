&gt; Yes, he is.  Poor thing.

&gt; DR

Here is one nut agreeing with another. Surely we remember the description by
Hines of Richardson? Birds of a feather.

If exposing dishonesty is the same as a hissy fit, no doubt,.more will
follow.

And there I have been wasting my time trying to find that message for which
Leticia Cluff praised Richardson for : &quot;He deserves praise for his frank and
public admissions that he was in error, and for his _displays of
graciousness_ in thanking the experts whose opinions he heeded.&quot;

Graciousness is not a word I would apply to Richardson, not after the way he
treats people. This time he had his head on the chopping block, there was no
other way to go for him.

As always with best wishes

It's a pity Leo and Peter can't put their efforts into Genealogy,
Prosopography, History and Biography, rather than just continuing to rag on
Douglas Richardson.

Leo and Peter continue to indulge themselves in a Long Hissy Fit against
Douglas Richardson.....

taf has now joined them.

Tempest in a teapot.

Douglas Richardson did the right thing -- he REVISED and EXTENDED his
REMARKS.

Anyone is entitled to do that.  Congressmen and Senators do it all the time.

If DR did indeed remove the original &quot;wrong&quot; message from Google, that's a
Good Thing too.  It won't be there to mislead someone in the future.

What do Leo, Peter and taf think happens in the publishing world when a new
edition of a book comes out?  Things are CHANGED and CORRECTED, including
factual errors.

To then stress that DR must go around and thank everyone who may have
spurred him to make some corrections is also overwrought, unreasonable and
tedious.

That can become a long battle of who shot John, who should get credit, _mea
culpas_ and all other sorts of wastes of time.

Better just to move on and do Real Genealogy without all the small-minded
back-biting that Leo, Peter and taf have become past Masters of.

&gt; He send [sic] out a message.

&gt; He is told he is wrong

&gt; He removes his original message from the Google archives

&gt; He sends his re-written message-------without saying it is a re-write,
&gt; without acknowledging he was wrong in the first place.
