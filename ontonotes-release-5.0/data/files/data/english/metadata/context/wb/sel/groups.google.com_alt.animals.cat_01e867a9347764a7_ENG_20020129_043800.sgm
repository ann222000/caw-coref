because it was summer and hot) to put them in the wire carry cage and
let the other cats roam around them. This let me have the door open
when they were not ready to go out, so the other cats could lead a more
normal life - in summer if it's warm and I'm in the front room the door
is normally open and they wander in and out as it suits them, until I
call them in for the night. Rufus however likes to live out if it's
very hot. I think he finds cooler places in and under trees than in the
house.

There is nothing more interesting to a cat than another cat. I've always
kept more than one at a time. In fact, when Madison died, Nemo (14 yr old
neutered male) seemed to be wasting away and I was afraid I would lose him
too. Then I got a new kitten and he perked right up. I kept her in a kennel
whenever I was not around to supervise but that only lasted a few days. Nemo
is thriving again. So, I am a real believer in keeping at least two cats at
a time.

I think getting a second cat is a wonderful idea!

As for male, or female...all personal preference. We have 4 males and one
female. We didn't do that deliberately, just worked out that way. Tabitha is
a bundle of love, just like the males. She can be stand-offish at times, but
she enjoys playing tag with the boys and &quot;mothering&quot; them. And wants nothing
more than a warm lap to curl up in.

Same thing with age. Our oldest cat, Wolf, is 9 years old, the youngest,
Spot, is 5 months. Wolf has been known to run and carry on with Spot as if
he were 5 months also. I would try and get a cat who has been around other
cats already.

I believe a new cat should be quarantined for a while. At least until it
gets a clean bill of health from your vet. I normally put the newbie in the
bathroom with their own litterbox, food and water dishes, a cat bed and
scratching post. No, our bathroom isn't large, we just buy small. *S* I'll
allow the cats to see and smell the new one for short periods, usually about
10-15 minutes several times the first couple days. After that, the new one
gets to come out more often for longer periods and wonder around some.
Always keeping a very close eye on things. I'll do this for about a week,
until I feel that things are going along smoothly, and know there will be no
major problems. Be sure to give the older cat a little more love and
attention during the introduction. I've had intros take less than a week,
and some that took over a month until the existing cats would come 'round to
the idea that the new one was here to stay.

Lots of luck with your decision!!

I would suggest getting a pal for your loved one, Get one that is close to
the same age and differant sex, as cats can be territorial, But if they grow
up together and get used to each other it should stop the loneliness the
first one is feeling. I do also think it is a great idea to introduce them
slowly, so that the first one does not get jealous. good luck

"/> Cats (except lions and a few examples of feral domestic cats) living
naturally usually live solitary lives after puberty - about 6 months of
age for domestic cats. We take them away from their mother and litter
mates far younger than they would leave in nature, which I believe is
why young kittens seems to benefit so much from a companion - it's
restoring some of what they have lost. Even pedigree cats are usually a
maximum of 15 weeks when they leave home, which is up to a couple of
months early really.

However cats living with us are to some degree not really growing up and
can enjoy companions throughout their lives - with mine they sometimes
take it in turns to 'play mum'.

A good supply of food helps!

"/> Vaccinations and parasite control (internal and external) are not
expensive and seem to get cheaper every year - about £25 for the full UK
set last time. However the costs mount if they need a dental - one of
mine has had one every 2-3 years of his life.

Really the problems start if a cat gets ill some way or hurts itself -
one came home with a badly broken leg many years ago but had almost
certainly slipped as his claws were not ragged. If cats are involved in
RTAs they nearly always end up with the points of the claws rubbed off.
It cost nearly £600 in 3 operations to save his leg and remove most of
the post-operative pain. The other expensive thing is if one catches
some kind of illness - cat flu or tummy trouble - and it affects the
rest. I took one to a show many years ago and he clearly picked up a
respiratory infection there which spread round all of them who were all
poorly to different degrees. I was in and out of the vets for a week
and felt like leaving my credit card there.

Keeping your cat in will greatly reduce the chances of it catching
things (though mine start behaving abominably when it's nasty weather
and they stay in - they can end up fighting so I'm at the vets getting a
bite fixed...) but it doesn't remove the risk, not does it remove the
chances of getting parasites, it just reduces them.

I have two cats myself. They are brother and sister, came to my house when
they were 2-3 months old. They keep each other companies very well. But yes,
then you get double sources on distortion in your house. You will need two
kitten litter bins, two heavy vet bills, two bowls to put their food in...
So just make sure you are ready for the responsibilities. It's like having
kids, just that they don't need to be sent to schools. CATS are lovely
companion to us too, so if you think it's worthy, then you should go ahead
getting your second cat.

&gt;&gt;Five?

&gt; Four these days.

&gt;&gt;With garden?

&gt; No garden but I live on an unmade road and they enjoy a bit of running
&gt; around out there.

What about cat dreamings?
Do anybody pretend interpreting anything of them?

&gt; Vaccinations and parasite control (internal and external) are not
&gt; expensive and seem to get cheaper every year - about £25 for the full UK
&gt; set last time. However the costs mount if they need a dental - one of
&gt; mine has had one every 2-3 years of his life.

&gt; Really the problems start if a cat gets ill some way or hurts itself -
&gt; one came home with a badly broken leg many years ago but had almost
&gt; certainly slipped as his claws were not ragged. If cats are involved in
&gt; RTAs they nearly always end up with the points of the claws rubbed off.
&gt; It cost nearly £600 in 3 operations to save his leg and remove most of
&gt; the post-operative pain. The other expensive thing is if one catches
&gt; some kind of illness - cat flu or tummy trouble - and it affects the
&gt; rest. I took one to a show many years ago and he clearly picked up a
&gt; respiratory infection there which spread round all of them who were all
&gt; poorly to different degrees. I was in and out of the vets for a week
&gt; and felt like leaving my credit card there.

&gt; Keeping your cat in will greatly reduce the chances of it catching
&gt; things (though mine start behaving abominably when it's nasty weather
&gt; and they stay in - they can end up fighting so I'm at the vets getting a
&gt; bite fixed...) but it doesn't remove the risk, not does it remove the
&gt; chances of getting parasites, it just reduces them.

"/> Ok. I have two in an apparment and they can't broke nothing.
There are only risks in opening the windows.

&gt;I have two cats myself. They are brother and sister, came to my house when
&gt;they were 2-3 months old. They keep each other companies very well. But yes,
&gt;then you get double sources on distortion in your house. You will need two
&gt;kitten litter bins, two heavy vet bills, two bowls to put their food in...
&gt;So just make sure you are ready for the responsibilities. It's like having
&gt;kids, just that they don't need to be sent to schools. CATS are lovely
&gt;companion to us too, so if you think it's worthy, then you should go ahead
&gt;getting your second cat.

"/> Mine are all happy to use the same litter tray (though I do use more
litter), and if the cost of an eating bowl is something to think about
then cats would really be far too expensive - the cost of a weeks food
is about the same as a cheap bowl.
