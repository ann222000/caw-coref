Personal Decisions Of The Heart: Clearing Out The Muck!

Did you start your day with Love or Hate? Discover how to improve
the quality of your life by asking this simple question, daily!

Will you take your emotional life into your own hands?

Weighing the cost always involves some potential discomfort,
especially if you have had your head stuck in the sand, like an
ostrich. But it will be worth the investment of time, energy and
discomfort when you can see and feel the results of the backlog (
the muck) of feelings that have been coloring your life, in
colors you don't want.

It will almost seem like magic, because the inner resistance of
fighting with yourself everyday will diminish the struggle you
have to go through just to make it through the day. And when you
make a choice it will appear to bring the desired results you
want, almost instantaneously. But first you need to know that
there are only two categories of feelings...Love and Fear. All
the negative ones, like hate, jealousy, bitterness, self-pity,
self-doubt, revenge, envy, fall into the category of fear. Joy,
peace, harmony, gentleness, kindness, humbleness, generosity, and
faith fit under the heading of love.

But did you know that fear can be of two types?

Yes, you heard correctly! There is imaginary fear and real fear.
Imaginary fear can occur from the backlog of fears buried alive
that your cells have been accumulating since conception. Real
fear comes about when your body registers some form of physical
danger to your bodily organism. The trick is to determine which
is real and which is imaginary as they both feel the same to the
body. And in either case, you will notice that the daily inner
struggle you face takes place with an invisible foe that is
always lurking beneath the surface of your rational mind, like a
tiger waiting to leap out at you and devour you. It's as if
you've fallen asleep at the wheel of your car and the car is on
automatic pilot or cruise control. The only problem is that where
is the cruise taking you?

This state can be referred to as a zombie or the walking dead.
You see but you don't see. You hear but you don't hear. You
bump into things but are barely aware of having done so unless
your body gets terribly mangled. This sleep state is a defense
mechanism that operates within you when the feelings are too
painful to feel. So you block them out, put up walls to avoid the
emotional experience and live primarily from your intellect (from
the neck up).

Often we see photos of people who unsuspectingly walk through a
field laced with live buried landmines. You never notice them as
you are walking through the field until you're hit by one of
them. If you are still intact to any degree and alive to tell the
tale, after the explosions, you may find your life going off in a
completely different direction than you had started out in.
E-motions work similarly to this landmine example.

So, how do you go through them with the limited knowledge you
have of the terrain? And how do you deal with the fear within you
that you don't know how to de-activate them to prevent them from
exploding again?

You take a road map and a safety or first aid kit with you! The
first rule of thumb is to take a trusted guide. One who has been
down the route before and who has Knowledge of the terrain along
with the confidence that you lack to navigate it. This would be
very advantageous to you.

Everyday, people like police, emergency ambulance personnel,
lifeguards and firemen and women face dangerous situations.
However, before they go into the live situations they study the
theory and practice until their training becomes second nature to
them. This way when they meet the danger head on in real life,
they react from a well formed habit of self-preservation first.
They know instinctively what to do in case they should get
injured during any rescue attempt. The same approach applies to
those of you who deliberately set out to face your fears and tame
them.

You know that your ultimate goal is to have your emotions do your
bidding rather than you doing theirs. But who are the people who
will meet the criteria you need to help you face our innermost
fears, hatreds, resentments, jealousies, and pent-up rage ( your
landmines)? It will be your faithful and trusted guide! Keep in
mind that your guide will have to be someone who can see the way
clearly from a 380 degree perspective. As well, the guide will
have to be so powerful that s/he can capture and take control of
the invisible forces of your feelingsas wll as the elements of
nature.

You will also need to believe that this individual can do so
instantly when you cry out for help. Once you have found your
rescuer you will have to get acquainted with him or her. In my
case it is Jesus, and The Holy Spirit.

Then you will need to find others who are willing to make this
trip with you to The Most Sought After Frontier - The Heart Of
The Matter - Feelings. This way you'll have another human being
to cling to when you need the comforting touch of another person
to keep you grounded in reality. In fact, if there is a group who
is willing to unlearn old habits, and thought and feeling
patterns that fit under the category of fear, it would be wise to
arrange to journey along with them as much and as much far as
possible. Between all of you, you will notice things about the
journey that by yourself you might miss.

However, if you both fall asleep on the journey at the same time
(or go into your defense mechanisms at the same time ) you will
want to find a guide who never falls asleep  So that s/he can
instantly flip the switch off the emotional turbulence that you
may get caught up in.

Of course, having a list of people that you can reach out to at a
moment's notice, by telephone, would be advisable. You will want
to make certain that they are good listeners and don't
themselves become triggered by your emotional release so that
they dip into their own &quot;stuff&quot;. They need to be skilled at
listening to you and responding in such a manner that they do not
try to stop  you or fix you up so that they can feel comfortable
emotionally themselves. In this way you can feel assured that
they will be able to help you get in touch with your own backlog
of emotions. You will then find your own answers and not theirs.

Becoming acquainted and familiar with your own defense mechanisms
will definitely be an asset. Certain behaviors, like falling
asleep when angry or fearful, overeating, starving yourself
physically, emotionally, or spiritually, overworking or using and
abusing alcohol, drugs, money, and sex, will notify you that you
are operating from your defense mechanisms. Whatever the behavior
is that cuts you off from allowing you to feel the emotions that
are going on within you, means that you are now operating from
the neck down (from your intellect)., Remember, your body is
always talking to you. But are you listening?

You will also become aware of and recognize the behaviors and
thought patterns connected to Positive Feelings of serenity,
harmony, peace, joy, gratitude, contentment and fulfillment.

Every now and then you will find yourself having a memory that
has no emotional charge to create more problems or challenges for
you. And you'll rejoice that you succeed even if it is only once
in dealing with your emotions

You will be able to learn how, when experiencing the depth of a
felling to switch it from the negative to the positive within
less than a minute. That alone will be miraculous because very
few people, if ever, come to that point before their physical
body dies.

And best of all you won't have to have the e-motions build up
and create disharmony, chaos, fear and crises in your life
because you will have learned how to help yourself become forever
free of being held hostage by your feelings!

Remember, it is a daily process which will eventually release you
to live  your life in a state of more calmness, serenity, peace,
relaxation, joy and contentment than you may have ever
experienced before. And if you had experienced such an emotional
state of well-being, you may not have known how to recapture and
hold the feeling.

So, if you are ready to do something drastically different in
your life and are willing to get the facts; then plan your
approach to The Most Sought After Frontier - The Heart of The
Matter - Feelings, you will definitely find it. You will have
discovered how to make Personal Decisions From The Heart and your
life will show it...maybe only sporadically, in the beginning,
but over time, more and more.

Are you ready to experience inner freedom? Will you break free of
being an emotional hostage? Will you clear out the muck ( the
backlog of FEELINGS)?
