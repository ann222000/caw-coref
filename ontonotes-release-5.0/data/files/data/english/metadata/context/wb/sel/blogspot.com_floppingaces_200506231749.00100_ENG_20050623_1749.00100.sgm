<P>This kind of thing just makes me sick to my stomach: (h/t Fjordman )
Faten Habash's father wept as he assured his daughter there would be no
more beatings, no more threats to her life and that she was free to
marry the man she loved, even if he was a Muslim. All he asked was that
Faten return home. Hassan Habash even gave his word to an emissary from
a Bedouin tribe traditionally brought in to mediate in matters of family
honour, a commitment regarded as sacrosanct in Palestinian society. But
the next weekend, as Faten watched a Boy Scouts parade from the balcony
of her Ramallah home, the 22-year-old Christian Palestinian was dragged
into the living room and bludgeoned to death with an iron bar. Her
father was arrested for the murder. "He gave me his word she would not
be harmed," said Ibrahim Abu Dahouq, the Bedouin mediator. "He was
crying and begging her to come home. They were even telling me that for
their daughter to leave their house as a bride would be an honour for
them. We never believed that love would lead to death in this ugly way."
... Maher Shakirat summoned three of his sisters to discuss a family
uproar after one of them, Rudaina, was thrown out by her husband for an
alleged affair. Maher listened to Rudaina's denials, and her sisters'
pleas that they were not covering up the affair. Then he forced the
three women to drink bleach before strangling Rudaina, who was eight
months pregnant. The other sisters tried to flee but Maher caught and
strangled Amani, 20. The third, Leila, escaped but was badly injured by
the bleach. Maher, a bus driver in his 30s, is in hiding but his parents
were arrested for allegedly ordering the murders and his wife was
detained as an accomplice. As he was taken into custody, Rudaina's
father, Amin, was asked why his daughters were killed. "Because they
dishonoured the family," he said. "A married woman who goes with another
man isn't good." ... Although honour killings have a long history in
Palestinian society, women's rights groups say the rise in these murders
cannot be separated from the resurgent violence of the past four years
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "Things are breaking down because
of the changing relationship between men and women. Increased numbers of
women are the main source of income while her husband sits around. That
is the kiss of death for that family," said Mrs Abu Dayyeh Shamas. "Men
feel they have lost their dignity and that they can somehow restore it
by upholding the family's honour. We've noticed recent cases are much
more violent in nature; attempts to kill, rape, incest. There is an
incredible amount of incest." Amira Abu Hanhan Qaoud murdered her
daughter, Rafayda, because she became pregnant after being raped by two
of her brothers. "My daughter fell over and broke her knee. I took her
to hospital and there the doctor told me she was pregnant. So I killed
her. It's as simple as that," said Mrs Qaoud on her doorstep in
Ramallah. Mrs Qaoud waited until the baby was born and given up for
adoption. Then she presented her 22 year-old daughter with a razor blade
and told her to slash her wrists. She refused so her mother pulled a
plastic bag over her head, sliced her wrists and beat her head with a
stick. The brothers were sentenced to 10 years for the rape. Mrs Qaoud
spent two years in prison for killing her daughter. She has purged her
home of all pictures of her older children, and declines to discuss the
killing, saying all she wants is to forget about it. Yes, you can say
that this is their culture but I give no pass for this kind of thing.
What kind of person would murder their own child for something like
this? It's disgusting and it should not be happening.</P>
