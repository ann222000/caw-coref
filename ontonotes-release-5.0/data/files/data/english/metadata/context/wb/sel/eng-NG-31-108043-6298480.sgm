Two different subjects in one topic (or is that the other way around).

Anyway, how does one achieve the following:

1. An extra domain for a Cleric. I know of the following ways:

- Bonus Domain (epic feat from ELH): one extra domain from the one
available to your deity
- Domain Draught (magic item from DMG II): basically a "potion" that
works only once, not what I'm looking for
- Divine Oracle (prestige class from CDiv): this gives one fixed
domain, not sure which, IDHTBIFOM
- Radiant Servant (prestige class from CDiv): get an extra 'Pelor'
domain, provided you have the Sun domain first; perhaps what I'm
looking for, but not sure.

Any other ways?

2. Flight for a Half-Dragon (a Medium one; a Large one gets his
'draconic wings' anyway). You can of course cast /Fly/ on him or give
him Winged Boots or Wings of Flying, but these cost him a standard
action to activate. Is there perhaps a feat, maybe in Draconomicon or
some such, to give a (Medium) Half-Dragon his wings, or a feat to make
him 'Large' or count as Large or something like that?

How exactly does this work? Is it permanent?

Contemplative from Complete Divine. IIRC, you get two more domains from
your deity's list over 10 levels.

One of the PrCs in Faith of Eberron gives NINE extra domains.

No, it works 24 hours, IIRC. 8,000 gp "potion", but it is under the
Wondrous Items section. You get the domain granted power, and the
associated spells as domain spell options. Neat idea, but not what I
need.

Hmm, guess I will have to go dig up my CDiv tonight...

I don't have the book (I've only looked through a friend's copy), but I
think there's a feat for this in Races of the Dragon.

I'd reduce the power of Bonus Domain by breaking it into two feats
(non-epic).

Extra Domain Spellcasting
You gain access to spells from another domain.
Prereq: domain spellcaster
Benefit: Choose another domain you have access to.  You can prepare
and cast spells from this domain as from your other domains.
Special: You may take this feat more than once, choosing a different
domain each time.

Extra Domain Power
You gain another domain power from another domain.
Prereq: domain spellcaster, Extra Domain Spellcasting
Benefit: Choose a domain for which you have taken Extra Domain
Spellcasting.  You can use the domain power of this domain.
Special: You may take this feat more than once, choosing a different
domain each time.

The domain spells share the domain slot at each spell level.

I'm not looking for house rules but only "official" stuff, and having
looked at the Contemplative in CDiv yesterday evening, this suffices
for me. The prereqs are easy. You take a small BAB, hp and Fort save
hit, but IMHO the bonus domain makes up for this.

Now, to give that Half-Dragon his wings...

Jeebus! does it give the granted powers, too, or just the spells?

Divine Disciple from forgotten realm players guide, its a pretty cool
PrC anyway and you end up as an outsider at the end of it (only 5
levels)
