Packers acquired RB Ryan Grant from the Giants for an undisclosed draft
pick.
His fine preseason has earned him a chance to get carries in Green Bay's
thin backfield. He could start out as the third or fourth back behind
Brandon Jackson, Vernand Morency, and possibly Noah Herron. The Packers
nabbed Vernand Morency in a simialarly-timed swap last year and he would up
playing a big role. Grant is worth a look in deep dynasty leagues.

Giants RB Ryan Grant looks likely to make the team.
The Giants will try him at David Tyree's old &quot;gunner&quot; position on special
teams. With Reuben Droughns playing some fullback, Grant could pitch in at
tailback behind Brandon Jacobs. Derrick Ward appears to be in front of him.

Former Notre Dame running back Ryan Grant has recovered from nerve damage in
his arm and is ready to compete for a roster spot.
A forgotten man in New York, Grant missed all of last season after being
injured at a nightclub in May of 2006. He'll compete for the third running
back spot behind Brandon Jacobs and Reuben Droughns.
