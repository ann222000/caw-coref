For those interested, this monograph came bundled with the latest issue
of Paleobiology:

Stanley, S. M. 2007. An analysis of the history of marine animal
diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
extinction rates.

2. Rates of extinction during mass extinctions are strongly correlated
with background extinction rates.

3. Sepkoski posited 3 faunas, termed the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and
Modern, based on their times of greatest diversity. The Cambrian fauna
never amounted to all that much, and Stanley ignores it; I will too. The
Paleozoic fauna suffered most severely from the end-Permian extinction
and never recovered its dominance. The Modern fauna, as the name
suggests, dominates modern oceans. Stanley suggests that the difference
lies in speciation/extinction rates, high for the Paleozoic fauna and
low for the Modern fauna.

4. During mass extinctions, taxa with high speciation/extinction rates
are preferentially eliminated (corollary of 1 and 2). Thus their risk of
total extinction is higher than for low speciation/extinction rate taxa.
Also, if there's variation in rate within a taxon, it will end up with a
lower average rate after the mass extinction.

5. Faunas have diversified at a constant exponential rate since the end
of the Cambrian, except for disturbances during mass extinctions. The
Paleozoic fauna, after the end-Permian, had its high-rate taxa mostly
eliminated, and has become more or less similar in rates to the Modern
fauna.

6. The apparent post-Paleozoic increase in the Modern fauna is real and
has continued at that contstant rate until the present. The pull of the
Recent can't account for it.

7. Species will continue to increase in number at an exponential rate in
the future, again excepting periods of mass extinction.

8. Sepkoski fit a logistic curve to history, i.e. with speciation
slowing down as some maximum capacity was approached. Stanley thinks the
exponential model fits history much better. And indeed it looks that way
from the figures he provides.

9. If you want to call this a trend of increasing complexity, well, it's
at least a trend of increasing numbers. Does quantity have a quality all
its own?

A caveat or two: I'm not entirely sure that all his methods are correct.
Conclusions apply directly only to taxa of well-skeletonized marine
invertebrates, i.e. the taxa that make up the bulk of the fossil record.
It's your choice whether you want to apply these lessons to
vertebrates, soft-bodied invertebrates, land animals, or plants. Offer
void where prohibited.

As far as Stanley is concerned, it doesn't exist. It's merely the
coincidental effect of a number of mass extinctions. You should see his
exponential simulation -- the fit to Sepkoski's plot is quite amazing.

Conceivably. But Sepkoski had a paper in Science once that claimed to
show that insect diversity is not a result of high speciation rates but
of low extinction rates.

No. But when you concentrate on those groups with good fossil records,
you can get a considerably better estimate *for those groups*. Whether
you want to think that generalizes to all life is up to you. You also
have to suppose here that genera are good proxies for species. And this
paper also works if lots of species are missing from the record, as long
as what we have is an unbiased sample. The less taxonomic disparity you
cover, the more likely that is.

Another way of stating this is that there are no groups which over the

No, I don't think that's a true equivalence. In fact, one of Stanley's

Hmm.  It appears to me that species that are generally less
well adapted would speciate a lot, in order to stay ahead of the
competition.  This might explain their higher overall extinction
rates both during normal times and under high stress.

Do you have a speculative model of the characteristics of high
speciation/extinction rate species that could account for
this pattern?

Really interesting summary.  Thanks a lot.

It seems quite logical that high rates of speciation should be be strongly
correlated with high rates of extinction, there might even be an
autocorrelation effect depending on the sources of data (I would suspect
there might be).  The first logical model that comes to mind is of course
that high rates of speciation suggest a more variable environment and
therefore more variable relationships between phyla and the environment,
e.g., more variation in niches prompts more speciation.  If that is the case
the rates of extinction should also correlate with niche variation because
enhanced opportunities for error (niche variation) also enhances the chances
for mass die-offs.  Of course this says nothing about the kind of niche
variation... it could be environmental in the sense of temperature,
salinity, pH and so forth or it could be predators or diseases.  Any
population bottleneck in a variable environment can predispose a species for
a disastrous collapse.  In an evolutionary sense every species is shooting
for an unknown survival target within its niche as it were and with a very
variable environment the target is moving so evolutionary misses are more
probable.

This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well

I assume this means that, while the extinction rate of the
group in question increases, the &quot;background extinction
rate&quot; (i.e., that of all the other groups) increases more?
This seems logical if my analysis of 1) is correct, since
more well-adapted groups should, on average, be less
well-adapted to changed conditions than the group which
wasn't as well-adapted to existing conditions before the
&quot;event&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt;&gt;&gt;compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of

&gt;&gt;&gt;necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt;&gt;&gt;correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt;&gt;&gt;extinction rates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Rates of extinction during mass extinctions are strongly correlated
&gt;&gt;&gt;with background extinction rates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Sepkoski posited 3 faunas, termed the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;Modern, based on their times of greatest diversity. The Cambrian fauna
&gt;&gt;&gt;never amounted to all that much, and Stanley ignores it; I will too. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;Paleozoic fauna suffered most severely from the end-Permian extinction
&gt;&gt;&gt;and never recovered its dominance. The Modern fauna, as the name
&gt;&gt;&gt;suggests, dominates modern oceans. Stanley suggests that the difference
&gt;&gt;&gt;lies in speciation/extinction rates, high for the Paleozoic fauna and
&gt;&gt;&gt;low for the Modern fauna.

&gt;&gt;&gt;4. During mass extinctions, taxa with high speciation/extinction rates
&gt;&gt;&gt;are preferentially eliminated (corollary of 1 and 2). Thus their risk of
&gt;&gt;&gt;total extinction is higher than for low speciation/extinction rate taxa.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, if there's variation in rate within a taxon, it will end up with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;lower average rate after the mass extinction.

&gt;&gt;Hmm.  It appears to me that species that are generally less
&gt;&gt;well adapted would speciate a lot, in order to stay ahead of the
&gt;&gt;competition.  This might explain their higher overall extinction
&gt;&gt;rates both during normal times and under high stress.
">

This is not a well-reasoned position, as it assumes that speciation is
some kind of adaptive response to poor adaptation. Instead, adaptation
is an adaptive response to poor adaptation. Species don't speciate &quot;in
order to&quot; do anything. It's just something that happens to them,
generally because of geographic isolation.

There are several such models. The one I think of right now is
Jablonski's distinction between species with planktonic and brooded
larvae. Stanley mentions this, generalized to high/low rates of
dispersal; also patchy distributions and small populations vs.
continuous, large populations; broad vs. narrow habitat preference; and
advanced sterotypic behavior vs. flexible behavior. In each case, the
former is expected to have high speciation/extinction rates and the
latter to have low rates.

&gt;&gt;Really interesting summary.  Thanks a lot.

&gt; It seems quite logical that high rates of speciation should be be strongly
&gt; correlated with high rates of extinction, there might even be an
&gt; autocorrelation effect depending on the sources of data (I would suspect
&gt; there might be).  The first logical model that comes to mind is of course
&gt; that high rates of speciation suggest a more variable environment and
&gt; therefore more variable relationships between phyla and the environment,
&gt; e.g., more variation in niches prompts more speciation.  If that is the case
&gt; the rates of extinction should also correlate with niche variation because
&gt; enhanced opportunities for error (niche variation) also enhances the chances
&gt; for mass die-offs.  Of course this says nothing about the kind of niche
&gt; variation... it could be environmental in the sense of temperature,
&gt; salinity, pH and so forth or it could be predators or diseases.  Any
&gt; population bottleneck in a variable environment can predispose a species for
&gt; a disastrous collapse.  In an evolutionary sense every species is shooting
&gt; for an unknown survival target within its niche as it were and with a very
&gt; variable environment the target is moving so evolutionary misses are more
&gt; probable.

And this is another potential factor, rather similar but not necessarily
identical to broad/narrow environmental tolerances.

Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;2. Rates of extinction during mass extinctions are strongly correlated
&gt;&gt;with background extinction rates.

&gt; I assume this means that, while the extinction rate of the
&gt; group in question increases, the &quot;background extinction
&gt; rate&quot; (i.e., that of all the other groups) increases more?
">

No. &quot;Background extinction rate&quot; is the rate of extinction during
&quot;normal&quot; times, i.e. at times other than during mass extinctions. What
he's saying is that the rate of extinction of a group during mass
extinctions is correlated with its rate of extinction during normal
times. More or less, the extinction rate for everyone increases by a
factor of [many]. So if group x has a normal rate of 1 (arbitrary units)
and group y has a normal rate of 3, and let's say many equals 12 here,
then during a mass extinction group x has a rate of 12 and group y has a
rate of 36.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This seems logical if my analysis of 1) is correct, since
&gt; more well-adapted groups should, on average, be less
&gt; well-adapted to changed conditions than the group which

&gt; &quot;event&quot;.
">

I don't think your 1) is correct, and I don't think that follows even if
it's correct. A group that was not well adapted would either adapt
(within each species) or go extinct. There can be no such thing as a
poorly adapted group over any very long time-span. Something must
happen, and quickly in evolutionary time. Now, many of the factors
suggested to result in increased speciation/extinction (see response to
someone or other just recently) operate partly by making it more likely
that environmental change will render a species poorly adapted to its
new environment. But it will then either quickly become adapted or
become extinct. Nor is is intuitively obvious that whatever
selective/extinction-causing forces operate during mass extinctions must
be similar to those operating during normal times.

I got the impression from reading your summary that most/all
groups that tended to speciate quickly gradually went extinct
and were essentially eliminated at the end of the Permian.  (Did

would link the earlier high speciation rates with the

I am not really satisfied with any of these as an explanation
for the general extinction of rapidly speciating groups.
Breaking them out my preliminary objections are as follows:

(1)
high rates of dispersal                     high speciation rate
low  rates of dispersal                     low rate

(2)
patchy distributions and small populations  high speciation rate
vs. continuous, large populations           low rate

(3)
broad habitat preference                    high speciation rate
narrow habitat preference                   low rate

(4)
sterotypic behavior                         high speciation rate
flexible behavior                           low rate

(1) high dispersal rates are beneficial because, among other
things, it allows rapid expansion into newly available
niches and would be particularly beneficial during most
imaginable extinction events, since it would allow the
species to find the few survivable habits.

(2) If diversity is increasing exponentially aren't small
dispersed populations what we must have now?  If so this
cannot be the key element leading to generalized
extinctions.

(3) Narrow habitat preferences sounds like &quot;specialists&quot;.
It seems to me that generalists are at least as likely to
survive an extinction event as specialists are.

(4) Insects (including beetles!!) have stereotypic behavior so
that cannot be the key factor that lead to generalized
extinction.

Throwing a couple new darts at this problem, I would like to
suggest two alternative explanations that could link &quot;High
speciation rates&quot; with the long-term general extinction of
groups with that characteristic:

A) Could it just be a more stable genome vs a less stable one?
Animals with less stable genomes would tend to speciate more
but a mutation rate that was too high could be devastating when
the population became tiny under stress.

B) Could it be that the species that survive today are able to
incorporate more diversity within a single genome?  That is
they can reproduce with partners that are more genetically
dissimilar.  The ability to tolerate/incorporate more genetic
diversity within a species would decrease speciation because
the members could live in a territory that included several
niches.  At the same time greater diversity would make the
species more adaptive during periods of high stress.

Obviously, intolerance of or incompatibility with genetic
variation would lead to more rapid speciation and a smaller
range of behaviors within each species.  Small isolated
populations combined with limited variability within each
seems like a recipe for extinction.

If I understand correctly, he is suggesting that modern species
do not (necessarily) have a better set of strategies involving
lower speciation rates, rather the environment has
changed/stabalized so that lower speciation rates are now more
adaptive, while higher rates were more adaptive prior to the
Permian.

I like that as an alternative view.

The simplest explanation that comes to mind is that the likelihood of
extinction is inversely related to  population size, and that groups with
high speciation rates  have lower populations per species, possibly simply
because a species does not have enough time to achieve a high population
before it resplits. This also explains the correlation in 2., although it
does not help understand why a taxa would have a high speciation rate in
the first place.

To me the most interesting thing about this is the exponential rate. I was
going to say that given the uncertainty in the data and the relatively low
rates involved, it is easy to confuse a noisy linear rate with an
exponential rate. But I notice in another follow you indicated that the
data fit was impressive. So I will leave it that I remain skeptical until I

I think if anything it is a trend in improvement of control systems. The
additional species lend stability to ecosystems by increasing the number of
loops - at least until extinction events occur.

No, not gradually. For the most part, the extinctions happened in the
end-Permian event. And the explanation is pretty simple. If extinction
rates are increased during a mass extinction by some huge factor, taxa
with the highest speciation/extinction rates are those most likely to
find their increased rate reaching the 100% mark. And of course you
can't recover from 100% extinction.

You have confused ecological niches with geographic range. Dispersal

I don't think so. Who says that high mutation rates promote speciation?
Experiments show that speciation by drift takes much longer than
speciation as a byproduct of selection. Mutation rate may have some
effect but it also appears weak compared to other factors. It's doubtful
that any species has a mutation rate high enough to be harmful to it
under any circumstances; there is in fact some evidence that mutation
rates are tuned to some rough equivalence of mutations per genome per
generation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;autocorrelation effect depending on the sources of data (I would suspect
&gt;&gt;&gt;there might be).  The first logical model that comes to mind is of course
&gt;&gt;&gt;that high rates of speciation suggest a more variable environment and
&gt;&gt;&gt;therefore more variable relationships between phyla and the environment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;e.g., more variation in niches prompts more speciation.  If that is the case
&gt;&gt;&gt;the rates of extinction should also correlate with niche variation because
&gt;&gt;&gt;enhanced opportunities for error (niche variation) also enhances the chances
&gt;&gt;&gt;for mass die-offs.  Of course this says nothing about the kind of niche
&gt;&gt;&gt;variation... it could be environmental in the sense of temperature,
&gt;&gt;&gt;salinity, pH and so forth or it could be predators or diseases.  Any
&gt;&gt;&gt;population bottleneck in a variable environment can predispose a species for
&gt;&gt;&gt;a disastrous collapse.  In an evolutionary sense every species is shooting
&gt;&gt;&gt;for an unknown survival target within its niche as it were and with a very
&gt;&gt;&gt;variable environment the target is moving so evolutionary misses are more
&gt;&gt;&gt;probable.

&gt;&gt;And this is another potential factor, rather similar but not necessarily
&gt;&gt;identical to broad/narrow environmental tolerances.

&gt;  If I understand correctly, he is suggesting that modern species
&gt;  do not (necessarily) have a better set of strategies involving
&gt;  lower speciation rates, rather the environment has
&gt;  changed/stabalized so that lower speciation rates are now more
&gt;  adaptive, while higher rates were more adaptive prior to the
&gt;  Permian.

&gt;  I like that as an alternative view.
">

I don't think that's what he was saying, and at any rate any explanation
that applies across all taxa can't possibly explain the difference
between Paleozoic and Modern faunas, because they both existed through
the entire Phanerozoic. Further, if you will recall, the idea is that
the Modern fauna has had a constant rate of diversification through the
entire Phanerozoic, so conditions could not have changed as you suggest.

&gt;&gt;Stanley, S. M. 2007. An analysis of the history of marine animal
&gt;&gt;diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt;&gt;In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt;&gt;compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt;&gt;conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt;&gt;necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt;&gt;1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt;&gt;correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt;&gt;extinction rates.

&gt;&gt;2. Rates of extinction during mass extinctions are strongly correlated
&gt;&gt;with background extinction rates.

&gt; The simplest explanation that comes to mind is that the likelihood of
&gt; extinction is inversely related to  population size, and that groups with
&gt; high speciation rates  have lower populations per species, possibly simply
&gt; because a species does not have enough time to achieve a high population
&gt; before it resplits. This also explains the correlation in 2., although it
&gt; does not help understand why a taxa would have a high speciation rate in
&gt; the first place.
">

Stanley suggests something similar to this, except that the mechanism
you propose for differences in population size is dubious. The natural
rate of population increase is on a much lower time scale than the rate
of speciation, and there should be time for populations to reach
equilibrium long before speciation becomes a factor. So we must look for
ecological reasons to explain differences in population sizes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;3. Sepkoski posited 3 faunas, termed the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and
&gt;&gt;Modern, based on their times of greatest diversity. The Cambrian fauna
&gt;&gt;never amounted to all that much, and Stanley ignores it; I will too. The
&gt;&gt;Paleozoic fauna suffered most severely from the end-Permian extinction
&gt;&gt;and never recovered its dominance. The Modern fauna, as the name
&gt;&gt;suggests, dominates modern oceans. Stanley suggests that the difference
&gt;&gt;lies in speciation/extinction rates, high for the Paleozoic fauna and
&gt;&gt;low for the Modern fauna.

&gt; If I understand correctly, (and I think you said this in a later follow),
&gt; the idea is that low rates of both speciation and extinction result in the
&gt; long term in more species than high rates of both  speciation and
&gt; extinction.
">

Yes, because of mass extinctions selectively wiping out groups with high
rates.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;4. During mass extinctions, taxa with high speciation/extinction rates
&gt;&gt;are preferentially eliminated (corollary of 1 and 2). Thus their risk of
&gt;&gt;total extinction is higher than for low speciation/extinction rate taxa.
&gt;&gt;Also, if there's variation in rate within a taxon, it will end up with a
&gt;&gt;lower average rate after the mass extinction.

&gt; I think both 3 and 4 are consistent with my explanation, at least as long as
&gt; extinction events are common enough to overcome any possible long term
&gt; advantage in a slightly higher ratio of speciation to extinction in a high
&gt; rate group.

Not sure of your point here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;5. Faunas have diversified at a constant exponential rate since the end
&gt;&gt;of the Cambrian, except for disturbances during mass extinctions. The
&gt;&gt;Paleozoic fauna, after the end-Permian, had its high-rate taxa mostly
&gt;&gt;eliminated, and has become more or less similar in rates to the Modern
&gt;&gt;fauna.

&gt; To me the most interesting thing about this is the exponential rate. I was
&gt; going to say that given the uncertainty in the data and the relatively low
&gt; rates involved, it is easy to confuse a noisy linear rate with an
&gt; exponential rate. But I notice in another follow you indicated that the
&gt; data fit was impressive. So I will leave it that I remain skeptical until I
&gt; see more about the article. I vaguely remember a review article in Science
&gt; a number of years ago on the subject, and hopefully there will be another.

Note that an exponential rate for a group is simply a constant rate per
species. A linear rate would be much harder to explain and would require
some sort of complicated mechanism.

&gt;&gt;the future, again excepting periods of mass extinction.

&gt;&gt;8. Sepkoski fit a logistic curve to history, i.e. with speciation
&gt;&gt;slowing down as some maximum capacity was approached. Stanley thinks the
&gt;&gt;exponential model fits history much better. And indeed it looks that way

This has come up before in previous posts.  Yes, it is a trend of
increasing complexity along the &quot;horizontal&quot; dimension.  As geological
time proceeds, there are more and different *types* of living things,
and this is one measure of complexity.

I looked this morning into a new evolution textbook, Barton et al.,
_Evolution_.  It has graphs showing the almost exponential increase in
families of marine invertebrates and vascular land plants since the
Cambrian.  If we consider these as representative of all life, then
there is more living diversity today than there has ever been in the
past 542 million years, despite all the great extinctions.

There has also been an increase in complexity in the &quot;vertical&quot;
dimension, represented by mammals and birds, if you consider what an
animal can *do* as part of its complexity.  These groups are able to
evolve rather easily in the behavioral, or &quot;3rd&quot; dimension (using
Jablonski's terminology).  The most complex animal that has ever lived
in terms of what it can *do*, homo sapiens, is alive today and is the
only animal that can evolve via the 4th evolutionary dimension -- the
symbolic.

So I would say evolution has clearly led to an increase in life's
complexity.

Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
of speciations within a group indicates that either the
group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
that the environment is in constant change. Or both. Or
possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
multiple speciation that entails. And I recall reading that
there's an &quot;average lifetime&quot; for species as there is for
individuals, although I don't know the numerical data (mean
*or* standard deviation) regarding that lifetime. On the
assumption that the species lifetime is similar for
similar-sized (number of species) groups (although probably
wildly variable *within* any particular group), a group
which produces more than the average number of species in a
given time would also produce more than the average number
of extinctions in that same time. Of course, if my
assumptions are incorrect the logic chain breaks down.

&gt;No. &quot;Background extinction rate&quot; is the rate of extinction during
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; times, i.e. at times other than during mass extinctions. What
&gt;he's saying is that the rate of extinction of a group during mass
&gt;extinctions is correlated with its rate of extinction during normal
&gt;times. More or less, the extinction rate for everyone increases by a
&gt;factor of [many]. So if group x has a normal rate of 1 (arbitrary units)
&gt;and group y has a normal rate of 3, and let's say many equals 12 here,
&gt;then during a mass extinction group x has a rate of 12 and group y has a

&gt;I don't think your 1) is correct, and I don't think that follows even if

&gt;(within each species) or go extinct. There can be no such thing as a

&gt;someone or other just recently) operate partly by making it more likely
&gt;that environmental change will render a species poorly adapted to its

Makes sense. I was (fuzzily) thinking something like &quot;If
Group 1 is well adapted to a particular environment while
Group 2 is less well adapted, a change in the environment
will definitely make Group 1 less well adapted to the new

increased adaptation for Group 2&quot;. Small chance, but greater
than zero. It's clear this is far too simplistic a way to
view this. Thanks again.

Yes, you can use random processes to develop complexity, but these
must be combined with sophisticated selection mechanisms and a ratchet
system first to recognize and then to accumulate complexity.

Nevertheless that is the Gould/Harshman vision of how evolution produces
complex organisms.  Mine was an ironic response to that.  I don't
believe, of course, that that is all there is to producing complexity.

To clarify, evolution *appears* to follow a random walk after all the
mutation, genetic drift and adaptation across deep time have taken
place.  This is not the same as saying that evolution *is* a random
walk.  That's what a creationist/IDiot would say, and therefore
evolution could never produce complex life.

Me, I'm on the side of complex systems theory, which posits that &quot;order

In life, mutation and selection may be *necessary*, but they are not
sufficient to generate complex organisms.

Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
geographically isolated from each other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&quot;Species lifetime&quot; doesn't require any mechanism other than chance.
Don't assume that species get old and die. There would be an average
lifetime if a species had a constant probability of extinction at any
time, and that's all it is. Now, if every species has the same
probability of extinction per unit time, the more speciose group would
have more extinctions simply because it has more species, just as the
more speciose group would also have more speciations.

No it isn't. Evolution produces complex organisms whenever complexity is
favored by selection. The points we both make (or made, in Gould's case)
are that 1) there is no pattern of generally increasing complexity
during evolution, 2) if species are presented with a series of selective
regimes in which greater complexity is favored/disfavored essentially at
random, the right tail of the complexity distribution will still extend
over time, and 3) what people have claimed to be a trend toward
increasing complexity is indeed a right-tail phenomenon, regardless of
how it's driven (or not driven).

This is a basic misunderstanding of what is claimed to be random.
Calling evolution a literal random walk would of course deny the
existence of selection, and without selection we would certainly have
little complexity; presumably we wouldn't even have life. No, what's
claimed to be random is just the direction of selection on a complexity
axis. Or to put it another way, there is no evidence to suggest that
selection consistently favors greater complexity.

They are iff complexity is favored by selection in a significant number
of selective regimes. Now in fact you have, to my knowledge, never been
able to explain what would cause growth in complexity, or even what it
would look like if we saw it, except that it would look like whatever we
happen to see now. Then you are left to try to find something that
actually is increasing over time and label that &quot;complexity&quot;. I would
have thought that species were systems, and that therefore individual
species should (by your theory) increase in complexity over time. But
since that seems not to be the case, you must search for something else.
But complex systems theory seems to have failed in its prediction, at
least in the case of species. Why?

Yes, that is all there is to evolution, a process that certainly is
_capable_ of producing complexity.  The most important point is that
complexity is a possible but by no means an inevitable result of
evolution.  What you fail to accept properly is that a random process
plus a selection process is completely different from a random process

Complex systems theorists are very fond of finding complexity.  What
they never talk about is the incredibly large number of systems that
are not at all complex, that show new 'emergent properties'.  You
simply ignore all those and just look at the very tiny percentage of
cases where you do find something interesting.  Incidentally, 'complex
system theory' is not an extra feature that must be added to mutation
and selection.  What are you suggesting must be added to make a
sufficient set of circumstances?  Where does that extra component
arise when talking about complexity in biological and evolutionary
systems?  Complex systems theory is simply a way of describing the
behavior of a physical system.  Mathematicians and physicists and
systems engineers and (some few) biologists have used that type of
description for over a century, now to describe various systems
without using the title 'complex systems theory'.  That theory is just
a consolidation of mathematical results.  &quot;Modern&quot; notions of fractals
and chaos and catastrophes are simply ways of emphasizing notions most
of which were long since known.

I, too, believe that complex system theory is the appropriate language
to discuss complexity and that those 'modern' notions are far superior
tools to describe many behaviors that are observed to occur in natural
systems.  Still, complex systems with all their fractals and chaos and
all their emergent properties are nothing more than physical systems
acting out the laws of physics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction rates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapted to their environments. This being the case the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation would logically seem to follow. Or am I missing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something subtle?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

&gt;&gt; Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
&gt;&gt; clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
&gt;&gt; tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
&gt;&gt; of speciations within a group indicates that either the
&gt;&gt; group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
&gt;&gt; that the environment is in constant change. Or both.
&gt; Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
&gt; cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
&gt; extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
&gt; would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
&gt; timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
&gt; in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
&gt; between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
&gt; geographically isolated from each other.
">

I agree that &quot;poor adaptation&quot; in itself would not cause
speciation.  (We are all always poorly adapted compared to some
imaginable ideal)

However, a fluctuating environment would cause speciation
precisely because it would lead to reproductive isolation.
Fluctuations would cause some members to stay where they are
physically after a change, while others would move to
environments more similar to the ones they knew before the
change.  These separated populations would be under different
selective pressures leading to rapid speciation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Or
&gt;&gt; possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt;&gt; the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt;&gt; multiple speciation that entails.

&gt; Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt; other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt; isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt; to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt; probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt; niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.
">

There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt;&gt; And I recall reading that
&gt;&gt; there's an &quot;average lifetime&quot; for species as there is for
&gt;&gt; individuals, although I don't know the numerical data (mean
&gt;&gt; *or* standard deviation) regarding that lifetime. On the
&gt;&gt; assumption that the species lifetime is similar for
&gt;&gt; similar-sized (number of species) groups (although probably
&gt;&gt; wildly variable *within* any particular group), a group
&gt;&gt; which produces more than the average number of species in a
&gt;&gt; given time would also produce more than the average number
&gt;&gt; of extinctions in that same time.

&gt; &quot;Species lifetime&quot; doesn't require any mechanism other than chance.
&gt; Don't assume that species get old and die. There would be an average

&gt; time, and that's all it is. Now, if every species has the same
&gt; probability of extinction per unit time, the more speciose group would
&gt; have more extinctions simply because it has more species, just as the
&gt; more speciose group would also have more speciations.

I'm using the term in the same sense Gould did.  Replay the tape of

things all along the evolutionary time line.  Replay it again.  You end
up with yet another set.  Each time you replay it, you get a different
set.  That's because there are two significant random processes at play:
mutation and historical contingency (i.e. random environmental events).
This constitutes evolution's random walk.

Yes. For instance the random process of mutation will generate a
different set of mutations which will be acted upon by selection, which
will lead to different adaptations, so groups of living things with
different characteristics will predominate in the population.

If you disagree give me an example of a deterministic process which
contains a random subprocess.

No, it constitutes an assertion that evolution has a random element.
Unless Gould simply redefined &quot;random walk&quot;, in defiance of prevailing

address whether evolution is a random walk.

False dichotomy. A random walk (sensu everyone but you and allegedly

I suggest you find yourself a textbook on statistics and educate

Easy.

The following process sorts a handful of stones gathered on a beach
into a linear, left-to-right sequence by size.

Subprocess 1.  Randomly place the stones into a line running left to right.

Subprocess 2.  Randomly choose a pair of adjacent stones.

Subprocess 3.  If the stone (of the pair) on the right is larger, exchange
the positions of these stones.

Return to Subprocess 2, repeating subprocesses 2 and 3 forever.

This process has a deterministic result, placing the stones into decreasing
order of size left-to-right, and keeping them there.  Yet subprocesses
2 and 3 are random subprocesses.

Sometimes processes with random subprocesses generate random
results, and sometimes they generate deterministic ones.  That has
been known for centuries.

Processes with ALL subprocesses deterministic are not guaranteed to
give completely deterministic results either.  If the process exploits
'deterministic chaos' it can 'explode' tiny and inevitable imprecisions in
the specification of initial conditions into full-blown randomness in the
results.

It is true that random walk with a reflecting barrier obeys different
statistics from an unconstrained random walk.  It is also true that if
you record the maximum excursion of a random value over time that the
maximum must necessarily increase.  Selecting out values of the
maximum complexity necessarily results in the complexity increasing
over time.  But if you start a random walk from the most complex
value, the chances are that it will DEcrease in complexity because
there will ordinarily be far more paths in the direction of decreasing
complexity than in the direction of increasing.  Or, if you will, it
may be a 50-50 chance of increase.  Certainly a random walk is NOT an
inevitable way of producing complexity unless you add enough extra
stipulations (like selecting and preserving extreme cases, exactly the
selection and ratchet I already described) so that the increase in
complexity must be attributed to those additions and not to the
underlying random process.

Somehow I got the impression that you believe complexity to be an
inevitable outcome merely from using complexity theory applied to a
random walk process.

Gould's viewpoint was that he was claiming that evolution does NOT
generate an increase in complexity but that the presence of a
reflecting barrier below which you cannot cross and remain alive plus
the fact that life started near or at the barrier created a
MISimpression that evolution increases complexity.

It sounds like you believe in &quot;progressive&quot; evolution.  Are you
claiming that you follow Gould in this belief?

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you disagree give me an example of a deterministic process which

&gt;&gt; Easy.

&gt;&gt; The following process sorts a handful of stones gathered on a beach

The small typo was easy to interpret.  What is a bit more difficult is
this last paragraph about a completely deterministic process not being
deterministic because of 'chaos'.  The fact is that what we call
normally call 'chaos' in the modern sense is really deterministic.  It
is just that it may look random in the same way that a pseudo-random
sequence is deterministic (given a specific seed) but looks random.
The fact that a process may eventually be totally depending on even
tiny differences in starting point or because of rounding errors
produced by calculations done with finite word length floating point
calculations doesn't change the deterministic nature of the outcome It
is just that the result may not be what you expected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For those interested, this monograph came bundled with the latest issue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Paleobiology:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction rates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapted to their environments. This being the case the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation would logically seem to follow. Or am I missing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something subtle?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of speciations within a group indicates that either the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the environment is in constant change. Or both.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
&gt;&gt;&gt; cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
&gt;&gt;&gt; would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
&gt;&gt;&gt; timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
&gt;&gt;&gt; in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
&gt;&gt;&gt; between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
&gt;&gt;&gt; geographically isolated from each other.

&gt;&gt;  I agree that &quot;poor adaptation&quot; in itself would not cause
&gt;&gt;  speciation.  (We are all always poorly adapted compared to some
&gt;&gt;  imaginable ideal)

&gt;&gt;  However, a fluctuating environment would cause speciation
&gt;&gt;  precisely because it would lead to reproductive isolation.
&gt;&gt;  Fluctuations would cause some members to stay where they are
&gt;&gt;  physically after a change, while others would move to
&gt;&gt;  environments more similar to the ones they knew before the
&gt;&gt;  change.  These separated populations would be under different
&gt;&gt;  selective pressures leading to rapid speciation.

&gt; This is an interesting idea, but I don't see that it has any
&gt; biological support.
">

We know (or at least agree I hope/believe) that:

1 species evolve differently under differing environmental
pressures

2 members of species will tend to invade new territories that
are similar (for their purposes) to their existing
territories.

3 A fluctuating environment will see changes of many and varied
character, but after a fluctuation many existing environments
will have new adjacent environments that are similar to the
old one, but many of the new adjacent (or overlayed)
environments will be similar to the original in different ways.

Thus, in a fluctuating environment different subgroups of an
existing species will find themselves on opposite sides of
differing environments, under differential selective pressures.

I will complete this argument below.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple speciation that entails.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt;&gt;&gt; isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt;&gt;&gt; to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt;&gt;&gt; probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt;&gt;&gt; niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&gt;&gt;  There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
&gt;&gt;  certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
&gt;&gt;  switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
&gt;&gt;  cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt; You're talking about Rhagoletis host races, presumably. They're
&gt; generally not considered full species, and whether this sort of thing
&gt; ever leads directly to speciation is under dispute.
">

Thanks for the name.  This is the one known from the US.  There
is at least one other known from Northwest Europe.  I can look
it up if you're interested, although I cannot imagine it having
any effect on this discussion.

I'm not going to waste time arguing about whether the diet
change in some Rhagoletis is by itself sufficient for
speciation (although I think this to be VERY VERY likely),
rather I will make the obvious point that fruit trees have
various and overlapping/separate ranges, governed by things
like soil conditions, temperature, parasites etc.

Consequently, by a simple process of hopping from host to host
over generations, some Rhagoletis will eventually find
themselves reproductively isolated, like those often discussed
seagulls (whose name I cannot -as usual- remember).

So going back to the argument above, constant changes to, and
instability in, the environment would result in a similar
pattern of range changes as species moved about to find more
convivial areas.

As an aside, it occurs to me that there might be something to
this (generally poorly adapted species = faster speciation
model) because if you are relatively more poorly adapted there
are more changes that would turn out to be improvements.  Thus
adaptive changes would (on average) be more frequent.

Sometimes these changes would make new territory/niches
available to the subgroup with the new modification and thus
cause reproductive isolation of that group.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I recall reading that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there's an &quot;average lifetime&quot; for species as there is for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals, although I don't know the numerical data (mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *or* standard deviation) regarding that lifetime. On the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assumption that the species lifetime is similar for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar-sized (number of species) groups (although probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wildly variable *within* any particular group), a group
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which produces more than the average number of species in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given time would also produce more than the average number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of extinctions in that same time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Species lifetime&quot; doesn't require any mechanism other than chance.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't assume that species get old and die. There would be an average
&gt;&gt;&gt; lifetime if a species had a constant probability of extinction at any
&gt;&gt;&gt; time, and that's all it is. Now, if every species has the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; probability of extinction per unit time, the more speciose group would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have more extinctions simply because it has more species, just as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; more speciose group would also have more speciations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, if my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assumptions are incorrect the logic chain breaks down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry to say that I think all your assumptions are incorrect.

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry to say that none of your arguments support my views.

&gt;&gt;This is an interesting idea, but I don't see that it has any
&gt;&gt;biological support.

&gt;  We know (or at least agree I hope/believe) that:

&gt;  1 species evolve differently under differing environmental
&gt;    pressures

&gt;  2 members of species will tend to invade new territories that
&gt;    are similar (for their purposes) to their existing
&gt;    territories.

&gt;  3 A fluctuating environment will see changes of many and varied
&gt;    character, but after a fluctuation many existing environments
&gt;    will have new adjacent environments that are similar to the
&gt;    old one, but many of the new adjacent (or overlayed)
&gt;    environments will be similar to the original in different ways.

&gt;  Thus, in a fluctuating environment different subgroups of an
&gt;  existing species will find themselves on opposite sides of
&gt;  differing environments, under differential selective pressures.
">

Sorry, no. You have not presented any reason why these groups should be
separate. If two slightly different environments are adjacent to each
other, we expect a continuous population to spread out across them, if
they're both hospitable. The population will continue to exchange genes
across the boundary unless something prevents them, i.e. geographic
isolation. Now selection can produce some local divergence in a few
traits even in the face of genetic exchange. But it can't produce a
speciation except under very unusual conditions that may seldom (never?)
be found in nature.

&gt;  I will complete this argument below.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;multiple speciation that entails.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
&gt;&gt;&gt; certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
&gt;&gt;&gt; switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
&gt;&gt;&gt; cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt;&gt;You're talking about Rhagoletis host races, presumably. They're
&gt;&gt;generally not considered full species, and whether this sort of thing
&gt;&gt;ever leads directly to speciation is under dispute.

&gt;  Thanks for the name.  This is the one known from the US.  There
&gt;  is at least one other known from Northwest Europe.  I can look
&gt;  it up if you're interested, although I cannot imagine it having
&gt;  any effect on this discussion.

&gt;  I'm not going to waste time arguing about whether the diet
&gt;  change in some Rhagoletis is by itself sufficient for
&gt;  speciation (although I think this to be VERY VERY likely),
&gt;  rather I will make the obvious point that fruit trees have
&gt;  various and overlapping/separate ranges, governed by things
&gt;  like soil conditions, temperature, parasites etc.

&gt;  Consequently, by a simple process of hopping from host to host
&gt;  over generations, some Rhagoletis will eventually find
&gt;  themselves reproductively isolated, like those often discussed
&gt;  seagulls (whose name I cannot -as usual- remember).
">

Don't bother. It turns out that the seagulls don't fit the story anyway.
Why would reproductive isolation arise? If there's gene flow, it almost
certainly will not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  So going back to the argument above, constant changes to, and
&gt;  instability in, the environment would result in a similar
&gt;  pattern of range changes as species moved about to find more
&gt;  convivial areas.
">

I can see a scrap of meaning in all this. If you are suggesting that
fluctuating environments would be more likely to create geographic
barriers to gene flow -- i.e. areas in which there is no suitable
habitat, too wide to cross, separating populations in suitable habitats,
then you will start to have something. Geographic isolation fuels
speciation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  As an aside, it occurs to me that there might be something to
&gt;  this (generally poorly adapted species = faster speciation

&gt;  adaptive changes would (on average) be more frequent.
">

Until the species became well adapted, after which point they would
stop. So you need a mechanism here whereby a particular group is
continually becoming poorly adapted, at a rate greater than its ability
to adapt. Aside from being a recipe for extinction, why should a
particular group retain this characteristic of being poorly adapted over
time?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Sometimes these changes would make new territory/niches

Sorry, but it wouldn't. Reproductive isolation almost always requires
prior geographic isolation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And I recall reading that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there's an &quot;average lifetime&quot; for species as there is for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;individuals, although I don't know the numerical data (mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*or* standard deviation) regarding that lifetime. On the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assumption that the species lifetime is similar for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;similar-sized (number of species) groups (although probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wildly variable *within* any particular group), a group
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which produces more than the average number of species in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;given time would also produce more than the average number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of extinctions in that same time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Species lifetime&quot; doesn't require any mechanism other than chance.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't assume that species get old and die. There would be an average
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lifetime if a species had a constant probability of extinction at any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time, and that's all it is. Now, if every species has the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probability of extinction per unit time, the more speciose group would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have more extinctions simply because it has more species, just as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more speciose group would also have more speciations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, if my

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More accurately one man's random walk is also known as a gambler's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ruin.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W Ross Ashby, a half century ago in &quot;Design for a Brain: The Origin of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Adaptive Behavior&quot;, described  how to build a problem solving system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If my 40+ year memory serves correctly, it ran something like this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Connect the system so that the unsolved problem is a state of low
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;entropy and the solution is a state of higher entropy.  Then let it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;operate and the problem will be solved!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that generating complexity by a random walk is about the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;level of sophistication and value.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nevertheless that is the Gould/Harshman vision of how evolution produces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complex organisms.  Mine was an ironic response to that.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe, of course, that that is all there is to producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To clarify, evolution *appears* to follow a random walk after all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation, genetic drift and adaptation across deep time have taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;place.  This is not the same as saying that evolution *is* a random
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;walk.  That's what a creationist/IDiot would say, and therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution could never produce complex life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you can use random processes to develop complexity, but these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;must be combined with sophisticated selection mechanisms and a ratchet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system first to recognize and then to accumulate complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is that all?  This is all that's needed to develop complexity?  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;say yes, then you side with Gould and Harshman.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that is all there is to evolution, a process that certainly is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_capable_ of producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is only an assertion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The most important point is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity is a possible but by no means an inevitable result of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution.  What you fail to accept properly is that a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plus a selection process is completely different from a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without selection.  How do you define a random walk?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm using the term in the same sense Gould did.  Replay the tape of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution, he said.  If you do you end up with a different set of living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;things all along the evolutionary time line.  Replay it again.  You end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up with yet another set.  Each time you replay it, you get a different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;set.  That's because there are two significant random processes at play:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation and historical contingency (i.e. random environmental events).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This constitutes evolution's random walk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it constitutes an assertion that evolution has a random element.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Unless Gould simply redefined &quot;random walk&quot;, in defiance of prevailing
&gt;&gt;&gt;usage,

&gt;&gt;And what, pray tell, is this &quot;prevailing usage&quot;.

&gt; See Wikipedia which says &quot;In population genetics, random walk
&gt; describes the statistical properties of genetic drift &quot;
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk
">

Consider the state space of life.  Evolution follows a trajectory
through this space as a function of time.  At a given t the &quot;step&quot; to
the next point is random just as in an ordinary random walk, and it is a
memoryless, Markov process because the next point depends only on the
current point, again like an ordinary random walk.  Every time Gould's
&quot;tape of life&quot; is rewound and played again, a different trajectory
through the state space results.  That's why I say evolution is a random
walk in Gould's view.  Please keep in mind, this is not a view I agree with!

&gt;&gt;&gt;to mean merely &quot;non-deterministic process&quot;, it doesn't at all
&gt;&gt;&gt;address whether evolution is a random walk.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Gould (1997) uses the analogy of a random walk that begins near a wall.
&gt;&gt;Although the walk is random, the walker cannot pass through the wall, so
&gt;&gt;we should expect the walker to move increasingly further from the wall
&gt;&gt;as time passes. This does not imply that the walker is driven away from
&gt;&gt;the wall. The wall is analogous to the complexity level of bacteria. We
&gt;&gt;should expect evolution to wander increasingly further from this level
&gt;&gt;of complexity, but it does not imply that evolution is driven towards
&gt;&gt;increasing complexity.&quot;

&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest-scale_trends_in_evolution

&gt; It is true that random walk with a reflecting barrier obeys different
&gt; statistics from an unconstrained random walk.  It is also true that if
&gt; you record the maximum excursion of a random value over time that the
&gt; maximum must necessarily increase.  Selecting out values of the
&gt; maximum complexity necessarily results in the complexity increasing
&gt; over time.  But if you start a random walk from the most complex
&gt; value, the chances are that it will DEcrease in complexity because
&gt; there will ordinarily be far more paths in the direction of decreasing
&gt; complexity than in the direction of increasing.

&gt; may be a 50-50 chance of increase.  Certainly a random walk is NOT an
&gt; inevitable way of producing complexity unless you add enough extra
&gt; stipulations (like selecting and preserving extreme cases, exactly the
&gt; selection and ratchet I already described) so that the increase in
&gt; complexity must be attributed to those additions and not to the
&gt; underlying random process.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that any process that merely contains a random process as one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;component qualifies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes. For instance the random process of mutation will generate a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different set of mutations which will be acted upon by selection, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will lead to different adaptations, so groups of living things with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different characteristics will predominate in the population.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you disagree give me an example of a deterministic process which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contains a random subprocess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;False dichotomy. A random walk (sensu everyone but you and allegedly
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gould) isn't the only kind of indetermnistic process.

&gt;&gt;I said &quot;random subprocess&quot; not &quot;random walk&quot; immediately above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I suggest you find yourself a textbook on statistics and educate
&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself on what a random walk is before deciding whether you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution is one.

&gt;&gt;Maybe you should follow your own advice.  And I never said *I* thought
&gt;&gt;evolution was a random walk.  I was describing Gould's viewpoint in
&gt;&gt;response to r.norman.  For some reason he thinks I'm a randomist and
&gt;&gt;don't fully appreciate the role of selection, which is ridiculous
&gt;&gt;considering all the stuff I wrote about genetic programming in another
&gt;&gt;thrread.

&gt; Somehow I got the impression that you believe complexity to be an
&gt; inevitable outcome merely from using complexity theory applied to a
&gt; random walk process.
">

This is too specific.  There doesn't have to be a random walk process
involved.  However, complexity is a result in Kauffman's buttons and
thread model of the spontaneous formation of autocatalytic reaction
networks starting from a random mix of reactions.  So there you have at
least one example of emergent self-organization starting from randomness
and not involving selection.

I believe emergence and self-organization are universal processes
throughout nature that lead to complexity, but they are an outgrowth of
natural physical laws which don't necessarily include randomness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Gould's viewpoint was that he was claiming that evolution does NOT

&gt; MISimpression that evolution increases complexity.

&gt; It sounds like you believe in &quot;progressive&quot; evolution.  Are you
&gt; claiming that you follow Gould in this belief?

No, because I think there is more than a diffusion process producing
complexity.  And there is more than just mutation, genetic drift and

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction rates.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapted to their environments. This being the case the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation would logically seem to follow. Or am I missing
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something subtle?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of speciations within a group indicates that either the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the environment is in constant change. Or both.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geographically isolated from each other.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I agree that &quot;poor adaptation&quot; in itself would not cause
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  speciation.  (We are all always poorly adapted compared to some
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  imaginable ideal)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  However, a fluctuating environment would cause speciation
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  precisely because it would lead to reproductive isolation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Fluctuations would cause some members to stay where they are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  physically after a change, while others would move to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  environments more similar to the ones they knew before the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  change.  These separated populations would be under different
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  selective pressures leading to rapid speciation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is an interesting idea, but I don't see that it has any
&gt; &gt;&gt; biological support.

&gt; &gt; We know (or at least agree I hope/believe) that:

&gt; &gt; 1 species evolve differently under differing environmental
&gt; &gt;   pressures

&gt; &gt; 2 members of species will tend to invade new territories that
&gt; &gt;   are similar (for their purposes) to their existing
&gt; &gt;   territories.

&gt; &gt; 3 A fluctuating environment will see changes of many and varied
&gt; &gt;   character, but after a fluctuation many existing environments
&gt; &gt;   will have new adjacent environments that are similar to the
&gt; &gt;   old one, but many of the new adjacent (or overlayed)
&gt; &gt;   environments will be similar to the original in different ways.

&gt; &gt; Thus, in a fluctuating environment different subgroups of an
&gt; &gt; existing species will find themselves on opposite sides of
&gt; &gt; differing environments, under differential selective pressures.

&gt; &gt; I will complete this argument below.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple speciation that entails.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You're talking about Rhagoletis host races, presumably. They're
&gt; &gt;&gt; generally not considered full species, and whether this sort of thing
&gt; &gt;&gt; ever leads directly to speciation is under dispute.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the name.  This is the one known from the US.  There
&gt; &gt; is at least one other known from Northwest Europe.  I can look
&gt; &gt; it up if you're interested, although I cannot imagine it having
&gt; &gt; any effect on this discussion.

&gt; &gt; I'm not going to waste time arguing about whether the diet
&gt; &gt; change in some Rhagoletis is by itself sufficient for
&gt; &gt; speciation (although I think this to be VERY VERY likely),
&gt; &gt; rather I will make the obvious point that fruit trees have
&gt; &gt; various and overlapping/separate ranges, governed by things
&gt; &gt; like soil conditions, temperature, parasites etc.

&gt; &gt; Consequently, by a simple process of hopping from host to host
&gt; &gt; over generations, some Rhagoletis will eventually find
&gt; &gt; themselves reproductively isolated, like those often discussed
&gt; &gt; seagulls (whose name I cannot -as usual- remember).

&gt; &gt; So going back to the argument above, constant changes to, and
&gt; &gt; instability in, the environment would result in a similar
&gt; &gt; pattern of range changes as species moved about to find more
&gt; &gt; convivial areas.

&gt; &gt; As an aside, it occurs to me that there might be something to
&gt; &gt; this (generally poorly adapted species = faster speciation
&gt; &gt; model) because if you are relatively more poorly adapted there
&gt; &gt; are more changes that would turn out to be improvements.  Thus
&gt; &gt; adaptive changes would (on average) be more frequent.

&gt; &gt; Sometimes these changes would make new territory/niches
&gt; &gt; available to the subgroup with the new modification and thus
&gt; &gt; cause reproductive isolation of that group.

&gt; OK, given my lack of formal advanced training in biology
&gt; and/or evolutionary theory I'll just sit here quietly and
&gt; watch; that's the way I usually learn something.

the only biology course I ever took more than 40 years ago.
Pretty much everything I &quot;know&quot; about biology/evolution was
taught to me by Drs Norman and HarshPerson right here in
this group during the last two years.

Most of the examples that I have forgotten here come from
a marvelous little book that was recommended (as I recall) by
rnorman called:

Frogs Flies and Dandelions by Menno Schilthuizen
http://www.amazon.com/Frogs-Flies-Dandelions-Menno-Schilthuizen/dp/01...

which I highly recommend, however I just checked and I
originally bought it for $14.80 and they are now asking
$41.49 !!

Except for the price it is absolutely impossible to recommend
this book too highly.

On the learning part, I can only learn by getting into arguments and
trying to defend some position.  Then I keep changing my position
till I stop loosing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One man's random walk is another's increase in complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More accurately one man's random walk is also known as a gambler's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ruin.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W Ross Ashby, a half century ago in &quot;Design for a Brain: The Origin of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Adaptive Behavior&quot;, described  how to build a problem solving system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If my 40+ year memory serves correctly, it ran something like this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Connect the system so that the unsolved problem is a state of low
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;entropy and the solution is a state of higher entropy.  Then let it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;operate and the problem will be solved!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that generating complexity by a random walk is about the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;level of sophistication and value.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nevertheless that is the Gould/Harshman vision of how evolution produces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complex organisms.  Mine was an ironic response to that.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe, of course, that that is all there is to producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To clarify, evolution *appears* to follow a random walk after all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation, genetic drift and adaptation across deep time have taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;place.  This is not the same as saying that evolution *is* a random
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;walk.  That's what a creationist/IDiot would say, and therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution could never produce complex life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you can use random processes to develop complexity, but these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;must be combined with sophisticated selection mechanisms and a ratchet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system first to recognize and then to accumulate complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is that all?  This is all that's needed to develop complexity?  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;say yes, then you side with Gould and Harshman.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that is all there is to evolution, a process that certainly is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_capable_ of producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is only an assertion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The most important point is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity is a possible but by no means an inevitable result of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution.  What you fail to accept properly is that a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plus a selection process is completely different from a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without selection.  How do you define a random walk?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm using the term in the same sense Gould did.  Replay the tape of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution, he said.  If you do you end up with a different set of living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;things all along the evolutionary time line.  Replay it again.  You end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up with yet another set.  Each time you replay it, you get a different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;set.  That's because there are two significant random processes at play:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation and historical contingency (i.e. random environmental events).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This constitutes evolution's random walk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it constitutes an assertion that evolution has a random element.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unless Gould simply redefined &quot;random walk&quot;, in defiance of prevailing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;usage,

&gt;&gt;&gt;And what, pray tell, is this &quot;prevailing usage&quot;.

&gt;&gt;See Wikipedia which says &quot;In population genetics, random walk
&gt;&gt;describes the statistical properties of genetic drift &quot;
&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk

&gt; Consider the state space of life.  Evolution follows a trajectory
&gt; through this space as a function of time.  At a given t the &quot;step&quot; to
&gt; the next point is random just as in an ordinary random walk, and it is a
&gt; memoryless, Markov process because the next point depends only on the
&gt; current point, again like an ordinary random walk.  Every time Gould's
&gt; &quot;tape of life&quot; is rewound and played again, a different trajectory
&gt; through the state space results.  That's why I say evolution is a random
&gt; walk in Gould's view.  Please keep in mind, this is not a view I agree with!
">

Please keep in mind that it's not a view Gould would have agreed with
either. Gould didn't think evolution was a random walk. He didn't think
that the next point on the typical evolutionary trajectory was random.
He knew that there was such a thing as natural selection, for example.

But in fact different results from &quot;rewinding the tape&quot; (terrible
metaphor) don't require evolution to be a random walk, only that it have
some random component.

Nor does it require a belief in the randomness of evolution to say that
the distribution of organismal complexity we observe today could have
resulted from a random walk.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is too specific.  There doesn't have to be a random walk process
&gt; involved.  However, complexity is a result in Kauffman's buttons and
&gt; thread model of the spontaneous formation of autocatalytic reaction
&gt; networks starting from a random mix of reactions.  So there you have at
&gt; least one example of emergent self-organization starting from randomness
&gt; and not involving selection.

&gt; I believe emergence and self-organization are universal processes
&gt; throughout nature that lead to complexity, but they are an outgrowth of
&gt; natural physical laws which don't necessarily include randomness.
">

You can of course believe anything you like. But what leads you to
believe that this is either important or even necessary in evolution?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Gould's viewpoint was that he was claiming that evolution does NOT
&gt;&gt;generate an increase in complexity but that the presence of a
&gt;&gt;reflecting barrier below which you cannot cross and remain alive plus
&gt;&gt;the fact that life started near or at the barrier created a
&gt;&gt;MISimpression that evolution increases complexity.

&gt;&gt;It sounds like you believe in &quot;progressive&quot; evolution.  Are you
&gt;&gt;claiming that you follow Gould in this belief?

&gt; No, because I think there is more than a diffusion process producing
&gt; complexity.  And there is more than just mutation, genetic drift and
&gt; selection.
">

What exactly is there? And what makes you think so? If it's not a
diffusion process, why is there such a broad distribution of
complexities among species? If there is some force driving toward
greater complexity, why are so few species being driven?

&gt;&gt;Yes. For instance the random process of mutation will generate a
&gt;&gt;different set of mutations which will be acted upon by selection, which
&gt;&gt;will lead to different adaptations, so groups of living things with
&gt;&gt;different characteristics will predominate in the population.

&gt;&gt;If you disagree give me an example of a deterministic process which
&gt;&gt;contains a random subprocess.

&gt; Easy.

&gt; The following process sorts a handful of stones gathered on a beach
&gt; into a linear, left-to-right sequence by size.

&gt; Subprocess 1.  Randomly place the stones into a line running left to right.

&gt; Subprocess 2.  Randomly choose a pair of adjacent stones.

&gt; Subprocess 3.  If the stone (of the pair) on the right is larger, exchange
&gt; the positions of these stones.

&gt; Return to Subprocess 2, repeating subprocesses 2 and 3 forever.

&gt; This process has a deterministic result, placing the stones into decreasing
&gt; order of size left-to-right, and keeping them there.  Yet subprocesses
&gt; 2 and 3 are random subprocesses.

Ok, good example.  Contrived, but good.  I would have preferred an
example in nature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sometimes processes with random subprocesses generate random
&gt; results, and sometimes they generate deterministic ones.  That has
&gt; been known for centuries.
">

What I was thinking when I made the challenge were the examples of
evolution and genetic programming, both of which involve selection on
randomly generated products, and both of which are nondeterministic.
For example, when you re-run the GP on the 11-multiplexer problem
numerous times, you usually end up with different S-expressions which
implement the mux.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Processes with ALL subprocesses deterministic are not guaranteed to
&gt; give completely deterministic results either.  If the process exploits
&gt; 'deterministic chaos' it can 'explode' tiny and inevitable imprecisions in
&gt; the specification of initial conditions into full-blown randomness in the
&gt; results.
">

Like the logistic equation of population growth.  If you study ecology
you see some graphs of actual animal population data which exhibit chaos.

My to my chagrin, for I love alternative views to be right, the

I was going to address the selection issue but ran out of steam.  But I
have just enough steam left to do it here.

Point being, selection itself *fluctuates*.  That is, the environment is
continually changing.  Gould believed strongly in historical contingency
did he not?  He believed it was a major factor in evolution.  If a huge
comet hits the earth, that's one hell of a selection event!  If there is
a sudden increase in volcanic activity, which is one theory of what
caused the Permian extinction, that also is a major change in selection.

Given that throughout deep time there have been many such unpredictable
enviromental upheavals, evolution can't help but to be a random walk,
expect maybe on very short time scales, where you could claim that if
selection is fairly constant, evolution will then be approximately
deterministic.

Now, this part I'm not sure of, but in Gould's replay of the tape of
life metaphor, didn't he write that the historical contingencies would
also be different?  So it wasn't just play the tape through the same set
of historical contingencies and depend on mutation to produce different
results.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For those interested, this monograph came bundled with the latest issue
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Paleobiology:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stanley, S. M. 2007. An analysis of the history of marine animal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction rates.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapted to their environments. This being the case the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation would logically seem to follow. Or am I missing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something subtle?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of speciations within a group indicates that either the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the environment is in constant change. Or both.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geographically isolated from each other.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I agree that &quot;poor adaptation&quot; in itself would not cause
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  speciation.  (We are all always poorly adapted compared to some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  imaginable ideal)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  However, a fluctuating environment would cause speciation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  precisely because it would lead to reproductive isolation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Fluctuations would cause some members to stay where they are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  physically after a change, while others would move to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  environments more similar to the ones they knew before the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  change.  These separated populations would be under different
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  selective pressures leading to rapid speciation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is an interesting idea, but I don't see that it has any
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; biological support.

&gt;&gt; &gt; We know (or at least agree I hope/believe) that:

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1 species evolve differently under differing environmental
&gt;&gt; &gt;   pressures

&gt;&gt; &gt; 2 members of species will tend to invade new territories that
&gt;&gt; &gt;   are similar (for their purposes) to their existing
&gt;&gt; &gt;   territories.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3 A fluctuating environment will see changes of many and varied
&gt;&gt; &gt;   character, but after a fluctuation many existing environments
&gt;&gt; &gt;   will have new adjacent environments that are similar to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;   old one, but many of the new adjacent (or overlayed)
&gt;&gt; &gt;   environments will be similar to the original in different ways.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, in a fluctuating environment different subgroups of an
&gt;&gt; &gt; existing species will find themselves on opposite sides of
&gt;&gt; &gt; differing environments, under differential selective pressures.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I will complete this argument below.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple speciation that entails.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're talking about Rhagoletis host races, presumably. They're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; generally not considered full species, and whether this sort of thing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ever leads directly to speciation is under dispute.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the name.  This is the one known from the US.  There
&gt;&gt; &gt; is at least one other known from Northwest Europe.  I can look
&gt;&gt; &gt; it up if you're interested, although I cannot imagine it having
&gt;&gt; &gt; any effect on this discussion.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not going to waste time arguing about whether the diet
&gt;&gt; &gt; change in some Rhagoletis is by itself sufficient for
&gt;&gt; &gt; speciation (although I think this to be VERY VERY likely),
&gt;&gt; &gt; rather I will make the obvious point that fruit trees have
&gt;&gt; &gt; various and overlapping/separate ranges, governed by things
&gt;&gt; &gt; like soil conditions, temperature, parasites etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Consequently, by a simple process of hopping from host to host
&gt;&gt; &gt; over generations, some Rhagoletis will eventually find
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves reproductively isolated, like those often discussed
&gt;&gt; &gt; seagulls (whose name I cannot -as usual- remember).

&gt;&gt; &gt; So going back to the argument above, constant changes to, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; instability in, the environment would result in a similar
&gt;&gt; &gt; pattern of range changes as species moved about to find more
&gt;&gt; &gt; convivial areas.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As an aside, it occurs to me that there might be something to
&gt;&gt; &gt; this (generally poorly adapted species = faster speciation
&gt;&gt; &gt; model) because if you are relatively more poorly adapted there
&gt;&gt; &gt; are more changes that would turn out to be improvements.  Thus
&gt;&gt; &gt; adaptive changes would (on average) be more frequent.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sometimes these changes would make new territory/niches
&gt;&gt; &gt; available to the subgroup with the new modification and thus
&gt;&gt; &gt; cause reproductive isolation of that group.

&gt;&gt; OK, given my lack of formal advanced training in biology
&gt;&gt; and/or evolutionary theory I'll just sit here quietly and
&gt;&gt; watch; that's the way I usually learn something.

&gt;I feel compelled to point out that I dropped out of (or failed)
&gt;the only biology course I ever took more than 40 years ago.
&gt;Pretty much everything I &quot;know&quot; about biology/evolution was
&gt;taught to me by Drs Norman and HarshPerson right here in
&gt;this group during the last two years.

&gt;Most of the examples that I have forgotten here come from
&gt;a marvelous little book that was recommended (as I recall) by
&gt;rnorman called:

&gt;Frogs Flies and Dandelions by Menno Schilthuizen
&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Frogs-Flies-Dandelions-Menno-Schilthuizen/dp/01...

&gt;which I highly recommend, however I just checked and I
&gt;originally bought it for $14.80 and they are now asking
&gt;$41.49 !!

&gt;Except for the price it is absolutely impossible to recommend
&gt;this book too highly.

&gt;On the learning part, I can only learn by getting into arguments and
&gt;trying to defend some position.  Then I keep changing my position
&gt;till I stop loosing.
">

You shoulda took my course (back when I was teaching!)  Better yet, go
out and get a good intro text book.  For your purpose, buying a
previous edition cheap will do just fine.

For the record, I did highly recommend the Schilthuizen book &quot;Frogs
Flies and Dandelions&quot; about speciation but I also recall that it had
previously been highly recommended to this group, no doubt by Wilkins.

And that book covers Rhagoletis rather fully which allows me to segue
into that topic which is really a separate subthread higher back in
the history of this post.The importance of the example of Rhagoletis,
the Apple Maggot, is to sympatric speciation, one species turning into
two even without any geographic separation.  So having different
species of trees (Hawthorns and Apples in this case) having different
geographic ranges is not the point.  The point is habitat isolation:
each species (or more probably sub-species or race) spends its life on
the preferred type of tree even if the other tree is nearby.  Hence
the two groups are effectively separate from each other even living
completely in the same orchard.  And differences in feeding, whether
food preference or method of harvesting the food, most definitely are
capable of producing habitat or ecological isolation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One man's random walk is another's increase in complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More accurately one man's random walk is also known as a gambler's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ruin.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W Ross Ashby, a half century ago in &quot;Design for a Brain: The Origin of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Adaptive Behavior&quot;, described  how to build a problem solving system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If my 40+ year memory serves correctly, it ran something like this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Connect the system so that the unsolved problem is a state of low
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;entropy and the solution is a state of higher entropy.  Then let it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;operate and the problem will be solved!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that generating complexity by a random walk is about the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;level of sophistication and value.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nevertheless that is the Gould/Harshman vision of how evolution produces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complex organisms.  Mine was an ironic response to that.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe, of course, that that is all there is to producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To clarify, evolution *appears* to follow a random walk after all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation, genetic drift and adaptation across deep time have taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;place.  This is not the same as saying that evolution *is* a random
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;walk.  That's what a creationist/IDiot would say, and therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution could never produce complex life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you can use random processes to develop complexity, but these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;must be combined with sophisticated selection mechanisms and a ratchet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;system first to recognize and then to accumulate complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is that all?  This is all that's needed to develop complexity?  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;say yes, then you side with Gould and Harshman.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that is all there is to evolution, a process that certainly is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_capable_ of producing complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is only an assertion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The most important point is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity is a possible but by no means an inevitable result of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution.  What you fail to accept properly is that a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plus a selection process is completely different from a random process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without selection.  How do you define a random walk?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm using the term in the same sense Gould did.  Replay the tape of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evolution, he said.  If you do you end up with a different set of living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;things all along the evolutionary time line.  Replay it again.  You end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up with yet another set.  Each time you replay it, you get a different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;set.  That's because there are two significant random processes at play:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutation and historical contingency (i.e. random environmental events).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This constitutes evolution's random walk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it constitutes an assertion that evolution has a random element.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unless Gould simply redefined &quot;random walk&quot;, in defiance of prevailing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;usage,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And what, pray tell, is this &quot;prevailing usage&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;See Wikipedia which says &quot;In population genetics, random walk
&gt;&gt;&gt;describes the statistical properties of genetic drift &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk

&gt;&gt; Consider the state space of life.  Evolution follows a trajectory
&gt;&gt; through this space as a function of time.  At a given t the &quot;step&quot; to
&gt;&gt; the next point is random just as in an ordinary random walk, and it is a
&gt;&gt; memoryless, Markov process because the next point depends only on the
&gt;&gt; current point, again like an ordinary random walk.  Every time Gould's
&gt;&gt; &quot;tape of life&quot; is rewound and played again, a different trajectory
&gt;&gt; through the state space results.  That's why I say evolution is a random
&gt;&gt; walk in Gould's view.  Please keep in mind, this is not a view I agree with!

&gt;Please keep in mind that it's not a view Gould would have agreed with
&gt;either. Gould didn't think evolution was a random walk. He didn't think
&gt;that the next point on the typical evolutionary trajectory was random.
&gt;He knew that there was such a thing as natural selection, for example.

&gt;But in fact different results from &quot;rewinding the tape&quot; (terrible
&gt;metaphor) don't require evolution to be a random walk, only that it have
&gt;some random component.

&gt;Nor does it require a belief in the randomness of evolution to say that
&gt;the distribution of organismal complexity we observe today could have
&gt;resulted from a random walk.

&gt;[snip]

&gt;&gt; This is too specific.  There doesn't have to be a random walk process
&gt;&gt; involved.  However, complexity is a result in Kauffman's buttons and
&gt;&gt; thread model of the spontaneous formation of autocatalytic reaction
&gt;&gt; networks starting from a random mix of reactions.  So there you have at
&gt;&gt; least one example of emergent self-organization starting from randomness
&gt;&gt; and not involving selection.

&gt;&gt; I believe emergence and self-organization are universal processes
&gt;&gt; throughout nature that lead to complexity, but they are an outgrowth of
&gt;&gt; natural physical laws which don't necessarily include randomness.

&gt;You can of course believe anything you like. But what leads you to
&gt;believe that this is either important or even necessary in evolution?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gould's viewpoint was that he was claiming that evolution does NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt;generate an increase in complexity but that the presence of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;reflecting barrier below which you cannot cross and remain alive plus
&gt;&gt;&gt;the fact that life started near or at the barrier created a
&gt;&gt;&gt;MISimpression that evolution increases complexity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It sounds like you believe in &quot;progressive&quot; evolution.  Are you
&gt;&gt;&gt;claiming that you follow Gould in this belief?

&gt;&gt; No, because I think there is more than a diffusion process producing
&gt;&gt; complexity.  And there is more than just mutation, genetic drift and
&gt;&gt; selection.

&gt;What exactly is there? And what makes you think so? If it's not a
&gt;diffusion process, why is there such a broad distribution of
&gt;complexities among species? If there is some force driving toward
&gt;greater complexity, why are so few species being driven?

Please don't interpret my lack of response for either disinterest or
yielding to your argument.  It is just that John H does such a fine
job that I only have to pop in now and then just to keep my hand in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that any process that merely contains a random process as one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;component qualifies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes. For instance the random process of mutation will generate a
&gt;&gt;&gt;different set of mutations which will be acted upon by selection, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;will lead to different adaptations, so groups of living things with
&gt;&gt;&gt;different characteristics will predominate in the population.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you disagree give me an example of a deterministic process which
&gt;&gt;&gt;contains a random subprocess.

&gt;&gt; Easy.

&gt;&gt; The following process sorts a handful of stones gathered on a beach
&gt;&gt; into a linear, left-to-right sequence by size.

&gt;&gt; Subprocess 1.  Randomly place the stones into a line running left to right.

&gt;&gt; Subprocess 2.  Randomly choose a pair of adjacent stones.

&gt;&gt; Subprocess 3.  If the stone (of the pair) on the right is larger, exchange
&gt;&gt; the positions of these stones.

&gt;&gt; Return to Subprocess 2, repeating subprocesses 2 and 3 forever.

&gt;&gt; This process has a deterministic result, placing the stones into decreasing
&gt;&gt; order of size left-to-right, and keeping them there.  Yet subprocesses
&gt;&gt; 2 and 3 are random subprocesses.

&gt;Ok, good example.  Contrived, but good.  I would have preferred an
&gt;example in nature.

&gt;&gt; Sometimes processes with random subprocesses generate random
&gt;&gt; results, and sometimes they generate deterministic ones.  That has
&gt;&gt; been known for centuries.

&gt;What I was thinking when I made the challenge were the examples of
&gt;evolution and genetic programming, both of which involve selection on
&gt;randomly generated products, and both of which are nondeterministic.
&gt;For example, when you re-run the GP on the 11-multiplexer problem
&gt;numerous times, you usually end up with different S-expressions which
&gt;implement the mux.

&gt;&gt; Processes with ALL subprocesses deterministic are not guaranteed to
&gt;&gt; give completely deterministic results either.  If the process exploits
&gt;&gt; 'deterministic chaos' it can 'explode' tiny and inevitable imprecisions in
&gt;&gt; the specification of initial conditions into full-blown randomness in the
&gt;&gt; results.

&gt;Like the logistic equation of population growth.  If you study ecology
&gt;you see some graphs of actual animal population data which exhibit chaos.
">

Sorry, there is a tremendous abuse of the term 'chaos', just as there
is a tremendous abuse of the term 'fractal'.  Both of these require
rather strict mathematical prerequisites that are not at all met with
any finite data set.  There are graphs of animal population data which
look extremely complex but do not necessarily meet the technical
criteria.

You are now going to ask me for those technical criteria and I will be
forced to admit that I am away from home for several weeks and don't
have access to my math books.  I would have to google for the answer
and you can do the same.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity. Paleobiology 33(4s):1-55.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In it, Steven M. Stanley does a series of analyses based on Sepkoski's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compendium of marine invertebrate genera. He comes to a number of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions that may interest some of the TO regulars. (These are not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the bits that Stanley considers most important.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Background rates of speciation and extinction are strongly
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlated; that is, groups with high speciation rates also have high
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction rates.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to indicate that those groups are not as well
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapted to their environments. This being the case the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation would logically seem to follow. Or am I missing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something subtle?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am. I don't see how your conclusion follows.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry; I'll try to be more clear. Perhaps incorrect, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear. I'm starting with the assumptions that populations
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to adapt to their environments, and that a large number
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of speciations within a group indicates that either the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group as a whole isn't well-adapted to the environment or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the environment is in constant change. Or both.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or neither, in my opinion. Why would poor adaptation to an environment
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cause speciation? It's going to cause either better adaptation or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinction. Nor should fluctuating environment cause speciation. If
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would, if anything, cause adaption to fluctuation or, if on a longer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timescale, adaptation to new environments, none of which should result
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in speciation. Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between populations. Generally this happens when two populations become
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geographically isolated from each other.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I agree that &quot;poor adaptation&quot; in itself would not cause
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  speciation.  (We are all always poorly adapted compared to some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  imaginable ideal)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  However, a fluctuating environment would cause speciation
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  precisely because it would lead to reproductive isolation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Fluctuations would cause some members to stay where they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  physically after a change, while others would move to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  environments more similar to the ones they knew before the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  change.  These separated populations would be under different
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  selective pressures leading to rapid speciation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is an interesting idea, but I don't see that it has any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; biological support.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We know (or at least agree I hope/believe) that:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1 species evolve differently under differing environmental
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   pressures

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2 members of species will tend to invade new territories that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   are similar (for their purposes) to their existing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   territories.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3 A fluctuating environment will see changes of many and varied
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   character, but after a fluctuation many existing environments
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   will have new adjacent environments that are similar to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   old one, but many of the new adjacent (or overlayed)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   environments will be similar to the original in different ways.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, in a fluctuating environment different subgroups of an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; existing species will find themselves on opposite sides of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; differing environments, under differential selective pressures.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I will complete this argument below.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly that the group is expanding into new niches, with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the corresponding isolation and therefore the expected
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple speciation that entails.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would expansion into new niches produce isolation? I think it's the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other way around, actually. Speciation, or even simple geographic
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isolation, allows the two populations that were once a single population
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to evolve along two trajectories rather than one, and thus increases the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability that some population of the group will expand into a new
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; niche. The more speciation/isolation, the more chances.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  There are examples of fruit feeding insects, of which I am
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  certain you are aware, that speciate when some individuals
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  switch to a new fruit.  So the new fruit (niche) was the direct
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  cause of the isolation that lead to speciation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're talking about Rhagoletis host races, presumably. They're
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; generally not considered full species, and whether this sort of thing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ever leads directly to speciation is under dispute.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the name.  This is the one known from the US.  There
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is at least one other known from Northwest Europe.  I can look
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it up if you're interested, although I cannot imagine it having
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any effect on this discussion.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm not going to waste time arguing about whether the diet
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; change in some Rhagoletis is by itself sufficient for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speciation (although I think this to be VERY VERY likely),
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rather I will make the obvious point that fruit trees have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; various and overlapping/separate ranges, governed by things
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like soil conditions, temperature, parasites etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Consequently, by a simple process of hopping from host to host
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over generations, some Rhagoletis will eventually find
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; themselves reproductively isolated, like those often discussed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seagulls (whose name I cannot -as usual- remember).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So going back to the argument above, constant changes to, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instability in, the environment would result in a similar
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pattern of range changes as species moved about to find more
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; convivial areas.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As an aside, it occurs to me that there might be something to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this (generally poorly adapted species = faster speciation
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; model) because if you are relatively more poorly adapted there
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are more changes that would turn out to be improvements.  Thus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adaptive changes would (on average) be more frequent.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sometimes these changes would make new territory/niches
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; available to the subgroup with the new modification and thus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cause reproductive isolation of that group.

&gt; &gt;&gt; OK, given my lack of formal advanced training in biology
&gt; &gt;&gt; and/or evolutionary theory I'll just sit here quietly and
&gt; &gt;&gt; watch; that's the way I usually learn something.

&gt; &gt;I feel compelled to point out that I dropped out of (or failed)
&gt; &gt;the only biology course I ever took more than 40 years ago.
&gt; &gt;Pretty much everything I &quot;know&quot; about biology/evolution was
&gt; &gt;taught to me by Drs Norman and HarshPerson right here in
&gt; &gt;this group during the last two years.

&gt; &gt;Most of the examples that I have forgotten here come from
&gt; &gt;a marvelous little book that was recommended (as I recall) by
&gt; &gt;rnorman called:

&gt; &gt;Frogs Flies and Dandelions by Menno Schilthuizen
&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Frogs-Flies-Dandelions-Menno-Schilthuizen/dp/01 ...

&gt; &gt;which I highly recommend, however I just checked and I
&gt; &gt;originally bought it for $14.80 and they are now asking
&gt; &gt;$41.49 !!

&gt; &gt;Except for the price it is absolutely impossible to recommend
&gt; &gt;this book too highly.

&gt; &gt;On the learning part, I can only learn by getting into arguments and
&gt; &gt;trying to defend some position.  Then I keep changing my position
&gt; &gt;till I stop loosing.

&gt; You shoulda took my course (back when I was teaching!)  Better yet, go
&gt; out and get a good intro text book.  For your purpose, buying a
&gt; previous edition cheap will do just fine.

I'll buy whatever you recommend.
I have something like an attention defect disorder, so I'm unlikely
to finish it, but I'd like to give it a try anyway.

&gt; For the record, I did highly recommend the Schilthuizen book &quot;Frogs

&gt; previously been highly recommended to this group, no doubt by Wilkins.

&gt; And that book covers Rhagoletis rather fully which allows me to segue
&gt; into that topic which is really a separate subthread higher back in
&gt; the history of this post.The importance of the example of Rhagoletis,
&gt; the Apple Maggot, is to sympatric speciation, one species turning into
&gt; two even without any geographic separation.  So having different
&gt; species of trees (Hawthorns and Apples in this case) having different
&gt; geographic ranges is not the point.  The point is habitat isolation:
&gt; each species (or more probably sub-species or race) spends its life on
&gt; the preferred type of tree even if the other tree is nearby.  Hence
