OK... so I've only been back for a few days now, but jesus h. christ
on a crutch, I've never seen so damn many posts concerning the use of
pedals and stomp boxes and effects units, and boosters ad nauseum.
Setting up some front end overdrive on a shitty 60W SS amp is one
thing, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would
need anything other than a guitar while playing through a silverface
Super Reverb. That amp and dozens more that get mentioned here
everyday are perfectly capable of giving the player a broader range of
sonic dynamics than one could get through in a year. To say nothing of
the fact that it's not that damn difficult to just plug the guitar in,
dick with the amp and guitar settings , and pull streams of fluid
beauty from some of the tubed marvels that are mentioned here.

Sorry guys... I just don't get or buy into the need for anything in
the guitar/amp chain that would disrupt the organic nature of the
relationship. I might be able to accomodate the use of a nice chorus
(as I suggested to Tony) to maybe expand the sound a bit, but for the
most part I ain't buyin' it.

The older classic amps I've read about here (Princetons, Deluxes,
Super Reverbs, Marshalls etc) are imbued with a vibe that, while
possibly a bit on the one-trick-pony side, just ooze tone all by their
lonesome old selves. The newer boutique amps (too numerous to mention
but they know who they are) are so fucking versatile that slapping a
Boss O/D in front of it is analogous to painting a moustache on the
Mona Lisa.

Now someone here needs to fill me in on why this sudden urge to slap a
rack of modification pedals and outbboard gear into the signal chain
of an American Standard Strat played through a Deluxe Reverb.... or
through a Dr. Z for that matter... or even running a standard Tele
through a small Boogie combo amp. Everything one needs is contained in
5 places:

Your guitar
Your amp
Your hands
Your brain
Your gut

All else seems a bit superfluous to me. I'm starting to get the
impression that guitarists are turning into a lazy breed. There are no
easy answers to getting a pleasing sound (notice I didn't say the T
word). You practice, you dick with your gear (or buy different if it
doesn't suit you), but pedals (SS ones at that) disrupting the (christ
I'm gonna get cricified for saying this) &quot;feng Shui&quot; of your guitar to
amp relationship???? Can't abide by it. Haven't been able to since
1968 when I discovered that my 30 W Ampeg  was godhead compared to the
newest piece of crap SS shit I picked up to replace it (along with
half a dozen processor pedals).

OK... now I'm prepared to be torn to shreds. Guys, please tell me why
you think you need mod equipment. Make me a believer... I just don't
get it.

Love ya all...

Hold on... just wanna make one clarification before the deluge. I
officially exempt all modeling amps from this discussion. My
reasoning??? Well, modeling amps are not solid state modification
devices designed to alter the signal path and resultant sonic output
of a set up. They are what they are, despite their many shortcomings,
one amp that uses technology to &quot;simulate&quot; the sounds of other amps.

So if that's reasonable let's proceed with the discussion. If not,
then ream me good about modelers too. I actually like 'em.

I've got a handful of pedals (~12 IIRC) but lately I've been finding myself
hardly using them at all, and then only if special effects are called for
(delay, reverb for amps that don't have it, occasional phasing/flanging
etc.).  All my OD pedals are basically gathering dust.  The main exception
is the Keeley Java pedal, which gets a pretty good workout as it provides a
nice overdriven sound while maintaining the crispness of the highs and good
individual note definition that's lacking somewhat in natural tube
overdrive.  See my separate post &quot;Queen tribute&quot; if you want to see what it
sounds like.

But my feeling is, to each his own.  I like David Gilmour's sound a lot in
Pink Floyd, and my understanding is that he uses effects up the wazoo.  To
me, it seems to be important to see *how* these things are being used.  In
the hands of a master, they can be used to help create a unique sound
associated with the player.

I might have to standardise my response to this subject me thinks, heres
a reply I did for Keith on the subject of David Gilmours rig - which I
don't think is all that excessive. If I had the cash I'd probably do the
same thing. Even I have 2 different Distortion pedals (an Ibanez Tube
Screamer and a Boss Overdrive/Distortion). Actually in all I have about
10 different effects boxes, pedals etc, they all get used.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Gilmour uses pedals to make different sounds that you CANNOT get
&gt; without em Keith. Here are some tracks that he uses effects on that
&gt; you could not play otherwise;

&gt; Run Like Hell;

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMuiJVY6Oyk

&gt; Marooned;

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OMFiqNA6Ag

&gt; Sorrow (I don't think there is any amp you could squeal this much
&gt; Overdrive out of, pretty sure he used a Boss Digital Metaliser, shit
&gt; hot song too);

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njQtAC6EH8E

&gt; One of these days (Bass, but reputedly Gilmour played it originally);

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTrNQCYh70Y

&gt; Have a Cigar (Ohhh, mama what a song, just worked it out a couple of
&gt; weeks ago;-);

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zTdND11MP4

&gt; Echoes;

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CTVI4p6NQA

&gt; Any Colour you like;

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FuV42EVHJM

&gt; None of this would be possible without effects, AFAIC he uses them as
&gt; a tool. Its magic the sounds he gets, the older I get the more I can
&gt; hear in it, especially the early stuff. Pure genius.

&gt; And here’s a couple that are pretty clean for your perusal, &quot;On the
&gt; turning away&quot; and &quot;Wish you were here;

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v240bYbbrM

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj1L5jxlY4U

&gt; He may not be fast, he may not be accurate and he may not be
&gt; difficult to cover (in most cases;-) but what he does, he does well.
&gt; I can't think of anyone that does as well as him with what he has to
&gt; hand. And writing that stuff in the first place? That’s talent;-).
">

As a foot note, he actually used a Pete Cornish Big Muff for &quot;Sorrow&quot;;-)
Its all about getting unique sounds from equipment that otherwise could
not be got. I use a Phaser (can't afford a Leslie) its a cool sound that
you could only get by swinging your amp around by the leads otherwise;-)

Why bother with tone controls on an amp either for that matter?

Cool Rich... a splendid explanation without masquerading as an excuse.
That's what I wanna hear. You're damn right that if it's good enough
for Gilmour, and gives him his signature sound, then I may just be
missing the proverbial boat here. I still maintain though that most of
the posts here are from guys (or girls) looking to, not so much create
a new sonic pallette that some outborad stuff just might be able to
deliver, but more to just keep up with a sound that can be created
without the use of such gear. Again... why stick an RP100 or a cheesy
$39 tube driver in front of a vintage Fender Deluxe. It's just gonna
make it sound like a bad impression of a Boogie. Damn... just get a
Bogner or a Demeter or something if you want that sound.

But, again, your particular point is very well expressed and my eyes
are no longer closed... I'm now squinting.

&gt; &gt; Super Reverbs, Marshalls etc) are imbued with a vibe that, while
&gt; &gt; possibly a bit on the one-trick-pony side, just ooze tone all by their
&gt; &gt; lonesome old selves. The newer boutique amps (too numerous to mention
&gt; &gt; but they know who they are) are so fucking versatile that slapping a
&gt; &gt; Boss O/D in front of it is analogous to painting a moustache on the
&gt; &gt; Mona Lisa.

&gt; &gt; Now someone here needs to fill me in on why this sudden urge to slap a
&gt; &gt; rack of modification pedals and outbboard gear into the signal chain
&gt; &gt; of an American Standard Strat played through a Deluxe Reverb.... or
&gt; &gt; through a Dr. Z for that matter... or even running a standard Tele
&gt; &gt; through a small Boogie combo amp. Everything one needs is contained in
&gt; &gt; 5 places:

&gt; &gt; Your guitar
&gt; &gt; Your amp
&gt; &gt; Your hands
&gt; &gt; Your brain
&gt; &gt; Your gut

&gt; &gt; All else seems a bit superfluous to me. I'm starting to get the
&gt; &gt; impression that guitarists are turning into a lazy breed. There are no
&gt; &gt; easy answers to getting a pleasing sound (notice I didn't say the T
&gt; &gt; word). You practice, you dick with your gear (or buy different if it
&gt; &gt; doesn't suit you), but pedals (SS ones at that) disrupting the (christ
&gt; &gt; I'm gonna get cricified for saying this) &quot;feng Shui&quot; of your guitar to
&gt; &gt; amp relationship???? Can't abide by it. Haven't been able to since
&gt; &gt; 1968 when I discovered that my 30 W Ampeg  was godhead compared to the
&gt; &gt; newest piece of crap SS shit I picked up to replace it (along with
&gt; &gt; half a dozen processor pedals).

&gt; &gt; OK... now I'm prepared to be torn to shreds. Guys, please tell me why
&gt; &gt; you think you need mod equipment. Make me a believer... I just don't
&gt; &gt; get it.

&gt; I might have to standardise my response to this subject me thinks, heres
&gt; a reply I did for Keith on the subject of David Gilmours rig - which I
&gt; don't think is all that excessive. If I had the cash I'd probably do the
&gt; same thing. Even I have 2 different Distortion pedals (an Ibanez Tube
&gt; Screamer and a Boss Overdrive/Distortion). Actually in all I have about
&gt; 10 different effects boxes, pedals etc, they all get used.

&gt; &gt; Gilmour uses pedals to make different sounds that you CANNOT get
&gt; &gt; without em Keith. Here are some tracks that he uses effects on that
&gt; &gt; you could not play otherwise;

&gt; &gt; None of this would be possible without effects, AFAIC he uses them as
&gt; &gt; a tool. Its magic the sounds he gets, the older I get the more I can
&gt; &gt; hear in it, especially the early stuff. Pure genius.

&gt; &gt; And here's a couple that are pretty clean for your perusal, &quot;On the

&gt; &gt; He may not be fast, he may not be accurate and he may not be
&gt; &gt; difficult to cover (in most cases;-) but what he does, he does well.
&gt; &gt; I can't think of anyone that does as well as him with what he has to
&gt; &gt; hand. And writing that stuff in the first place? That's talent;-).

&gt; As a foot note, he actually used a Pete Cornish Big Muff for &quot;Sorrow&quot;;-)
&gt; Its all about getting unique sounds from equipment that otherwise could
&gt; not be got. I use a Phaser (can't afford a Leslie) its a cool sound that
&gt; you could only get by swinging your amp around by the leads otherwise;-)

&gt; Why bother with tone controls on an amp either for that matter?

OK... allow me to slightly modify my complaint here. I'll grant
everyone that reverbs, delays, chorus', phasers etc are far more
usefull regarding modifying the texture of the sound (although why one
needs more than one or two pedals I still don't get). My big beef is
with the overdrives, distortion boosters, EQ's, compressors etc that
actually have a direct effect on the &quot;basic&quot; sound of the guitar/amp
rig. I guess I didn't qualify that in my original post. I mean, aren't
ones sense of attack, ability to switch pickups (and amp channels if
so equipped), and making slight tonal variations on the guitar itself
enough to alter the sonic disposition of the sound enough to satisfy
ones needs for variation?

No;-)

Actually at home I am using an Epi VJ head thru a Lorantz greenback
clone. I will probably mod the amp at some point but for now I use
overdrives etc for 2 reasons, 1) I can get huge overdrive at any volume
and 2) it is far easier to control. I also use a 1970's (maybe earlier)
vintage Vorg (Pearl) 5 band eq to give the Strat more sparkle as the amp
has only one volume control. The overdrive on my SS amp sounds like crud
too, whereas my Boss and Ibanez stomp boxes don't;-)

That being said I like a lot of variation. Why have a beef with it, its
all clean fun. Ask Richl about his Java pedal;-) Oh, and the good thing
about pedals is that you can turn them off whenever you like.

Well, my old SF 100W Fender *is* a one trick pony.  The trick is
fantastic clean tones and that famous Fender reverb.  No channel
switching.  At utterly ear-splitting volumes it overdrives, but not
really in a pleasant manner.

Hence I use an overdrive pedal occasionally for distortion.  It sounds
*more* transparent with the pedal than with the amp hurling it's guts up
through the (single 15&quot;) speaker.

I generally agree with you however about multi-effects units into _nice_
amps.  Having said that - each to their own.  I just won't use them.

Cheers,
Andy.

Not quite enough for me: I have a Fender Twin that I almost exclusively
play through the boosted channel, and if I take that as the base 'clean'
sound (with some careful control via a volume pedal) then I really do
love the sound when I switch on a Boss SD-1 overdrive to push the amp
over the top. I suppose it's just as if the amp is missing *another*
channel, but it works for me.

Maybe I'd get the same sort-of effect if I twiddled with the amp, but
you can't do that in a millisecond just before a solo :)

well... if you want to talk about tone - then let's get real.
if we were really talking about true tone - then this discussion
would be about acoustic and classical guitars and the various
things associated with these instruments.

the minute you pick up an electric guitar you already have an aberration
in your hands.  So what you are saying is that somehow 'proper' tone
is derived through the use of minimal aberrations.  Electric guitar
and electrically driven amp.  Hmm.. that's 2 things too many already.

Once you plug in - anything is fair game from that point on.

Let's not delude ourselves - electric guitars are toys compared
to great acoustic and classical instruments.  So any discussion
that includes the perceived 'tone geek approved way of getting sounds'
from electric instruments is all a moot point.  It is just a tone geek's
way of validating what he or she does to make them feel good about
themselves and their gear.   It's ok though.  I understand.

We play with _toys_  and sometimes they are _very_ nice toys but please keep it
humble and in proper perspective.
I am sure the first violinist in the orchestra or perhaps a concert pianist
or maybe Segovia himself would laugh at our discussions of 'tone' and electric
instruments.  Electric instruments would be a diversionary treat at best.

Sorry - had to keep it real.  Don't get a big head on you about
tone geek approved things.  Some of the best out there indulge
themselves in all sorts of fx and pedals and even those clean
country tele players are known to have a compressor and tube screamer
always turned on and ready to go.  Gotta juice up that Fender sometimes.

I take my playing very seriously - but I like to keep it all in perspective.

So - anything goes!  This is electric fun!  There are no rules.
That's why we ROCK! and that's why we ROLL !

I refuse to buy into the tone geek approved methods all the time!
(ok. but it's still nice to know good methods sorta like a little mental
notepad - hmmm...  what would tone geek do here ?  hmmm...
would he plug the strat with approved lollars or fralins into the
tone geek approved fender twin - OR - would he (OMG!) have a double fat
hardtail Strat and then run through a tone bender fuzz and then onto
a 4 stage old skool phaser which all goes into the Soldano and 4x12.

Ummm.. ok.. lemme think... aha!  He should just plug the Strat with
the approved lollar black face single coil pickups into the Fender Twin.
which should also be equipped with the original speaker and all NOS tubes.

(DING DING !  We have a winner!!  That's the correct tone geek approved answer!)

Squier - you have just won a set of NOS Sylvania tubes for your Solid State Peavey!
congratulations!

heh.

This topic is kinda like religion.  A true &quot;fundamentalist&quot;
could go you one better and claim that an amplifier is just
that, and that *any* distortion (even the creamy, buttery
kind) isn't good  because it changes the true tone of the
guitar.  Clearly, that's not a popular view and an entire
industry has grown from the concept of an amplifier driven
beyond its originally intended operational parameters.

These things are just tools to help you arrive at the
sound(s) that *you* prefer, using a setup that you're happy
with.  If you play only one type of music and only want one
type of sound, then you can pretty easily target the
equipment and settings you need.  However, you should be
aware of and be tolerant of the fact that not everyone wants
or likes the same thing.  That doesn't mean you have to like
other folks' choices or tastes, but it doesn't make your
choice the only one God intended.  That attitude stiffles
innovation.

That said, a Twin Reverb doesn't produce nice distortion at
less than earbleed volumes.  An inline distorto box lets you
switch between the clean &amp; distorto sounds quickly &amp; easily,
with a single cable running to your amp. Most importantly,
it also you run those choices at a flexible range of volume
levels.  In other words, it balances the functional &amp;
practical aspects with the sonic output.

&gt; OK... allow me to slightly modify my complaint here. I'll grant
&gt; everyone that reverbs, delays, chorus', phasers etc are far more
&gt; usefull regarding modifying the texture of the sound (although why one
&gt; needs more than one or two pedals I still don't get). My big beef is
&gt; with the overdrives, distortion boosters, EQ's, compressors etc that
&gt; actually have a direct effect on the &quot;basic&quot; sound of the guitar/amp
&gt; rig. I guess I didn't qualify that in my original post. I mean, aren't
&gt; ones sense of attack, ability to switch pickups (and amp channels if
&gt; so equipped), and making slight tonal variations on the guitar itself
&gt; enough to alter the sonic disposition of the sound enough to satisfy
&gt; ones needs for variation?
">

I for one hate to mess with the guitar controls. It is far easier to stomp
on an when you're singing and changing to a different part simultaneously,
than to start fumbling round with the guitar knobs. Fine if you play
laid-back blues but with fast changes from parts to parts...nope. I never
use any of my guitars controls. It's always a bucker on bridge with the neck
single on as well, full volume, and tone control is just a mock knob
there...not connected.

I use a 4-button midi switch. I have one basic sound set up on the
amp(pre+poweramp), and I use 4-button rig to give me a rather clean/crunchy
sound, a little more dirty sound, a driven rhythm sound, and the same with
some delay and verb added from a slave midi FX box.

Live, I don't see how I'd need any pedals save a wah.
In studio/recording...a distortion box may be just what you need to sutbly
change the basic sound into something more pronounced for some passage, or
to make a 2nd track little different from the first one. A TubeScreames does
that for me.

Also a TS can be great if the amp doesn't have but one channel, so you
*need* a separate lead channel via pedals.

Pedal compressors I don't get, really, if I use one, it's a rackmount one in
the studio.

EQ's can also act as extra channels for the amp, i.e. to make a very thin
sound for those funky rhythms or sometthing. Or boost the input level for
guitars that have weaker pups.

In home recording...there I can use pedals to create unique sounds to my
hearts content...but live, all I really need is 4 channels and a wah. A
verb/delay for leads would be a good plus.

I think we largely agree. I don't use any pedals, although I do have a small
rack of time-based effects. As regards compression, distortion, eq, and
what-all else, I get that from the amp. I don't begrudge anyone their
pedals, and I used to use a few, but I don't really like what they do to my
signal for the most part.

That said, I may yet get a good wah at some point. If I did, I probably
wouldn't have it with me on half of my gigs, though.  I used to always have
a volume pedal as well, but I have gotten pretty good at using my guitar
volume as a substitute.

How do you play White Room without a wah? Just go &quot;wah wah&quot; into the
mic? Kidding!!! I use some pedals in the bedroom at low volume for
obvious reasons and some for recording...I don't play out much
anymore, but the louder I go the less I use. At a full blown loud I
use nothing but the occassional wah.

1) In regard to needing only a Super Reverb and a guitar: Sometimes
you don't have the luxury of cranking up the amp to get it to
overdrive.  In those cases, you need a dirt box or you need to carry
around several extra amps that will suit different size rooms (not
practical for most).

2) Effects are fun and add to your tonal palette.  Back to the Super
Reverb... Why do you need an amp with reverb?  It's no different than
any other effect.

Furthermore, why stick to the same old &quot;classic&quot; text book tones?
Sure, they sound great but I don't want to sound like every other
guitar player copping SRV and Hendrix licks.  I prefer to have my own
tone and those dirt boxes add a variable in the equation to make my
set up just a bit different than most.  We could get into the argument
of &quot;It's all in your hands&quot; but, IMO, that BS.  Yes, your playing
contributes quite a bit to your tone but, if that was the only
variable, we wouldn't be having discussions about this amp or those
pickups or that guitar - it wouldn't matter what you played through
including whether you used a distortion box or not.

I have been gigging for about 20 years without a single pedal. Lately I
switched from Blackface to Tweed amps and therefore I use a reverb pedal and
a tremolo (which I use for one or maybe two songs per evening). Sometimes I
can even be seen with an analog delay for that west coast jump sound. I find
nothing wrong with them as long as you don't rely on them do cover up your
own shortcommings.

What about two channel amps with, basically, a distortion box built in?
What about active pickups?  Should guys who use the mid-boost on EC Strats
be ashamed?  Lewis, ususally I agree with you, but this is off the mark,
IMO.  Over the years guys like myself have used distortion  pedals, treble
boosters and all manner of compressors to make those &quot;ideal&quot; amps do what we
want.  It was not laziness that prompted Jimi, Eric or Jimmy to plug in a
pedal to make that amp sweat.  And, let's face it, even the high gain amps
of today don't always come up with the sounds obtainable with a nice grit
box into a hard working tube amp.

I can't say that trying to replace an Ampeg tube amp with a SS pedal sounds
like a good idea, but haven't you used a compressor into that amp?  Here's
the essence of it for me.  If you can get a tone with a pedal and an amp
that the amp can't do by itself, then where's the problem?  Do it.

Luv ya back ;-)

Here's my take:  I'm a modeler fan, esp. for recording.  When
recording, I use a lot more FX than when playing live.  To me it's
like painting a sonic landscape.  When playing live, I prefer a
simpler approach because it's a different vibe, it's more direct,
urgent, whatever.  The audience doesn't have time to analyze the sound
as much, and I think all the FX would be wasted, plus there's no way
you can re-create an FX-heavy sound very well in a live setting.

So, to make a long story short, yes to FX for recording...keep 'em at
a minimum live.

I use one pedal, a Tubescreamer, and I do that to add a little edge to
my clean or a little boost to my overdrive on my F-50 without having
to turn it too loud. (wife still thinks it's too loud)
Also on my BJr to get that &quot;Stevie&quot; sound.

Iused to use a Tonelab through a rather sterile sounding Traynor
YCV80Q  and I can understand why people use them.
It's really the same thing as using a modelling amp but loading
everything in the front end and still having a tube amp when needed.
It's fun to try to nail the sound of your favourite artists.
I found I made some real strides in my playing once I had &quot;that sound&quot;
but then, when I got rid of it and bought a better amp and guitar I
made even more strides.

I don't know what you mean by &quot;mod equipment&quot; but people use pedals to
get sounds they can't get out of their amp alone.

Like overdrive at low volumes, wah, delay, phaser, tremolo, etc, etc,
etc.

&gt; &gt; I might have to standardise my response to this subject me thinks, heres
&gt; &gt; a reply I did for Keith on the subject of David Gilmours rig - which I
&gt; &gt; don't think is all that excessive. If I had the cash I'd probably do the
&gt; &gt; same thing. Even I have 2 different Distortion pedals (an Ibanez Tube
&gt; &gt; Screamer and a Boss Overdrive/Distortion). Actually in all I have about
&gt; &gt; 10 different effects boxes, pedals etc, they all get used.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Gilmour uses pedals to make different sounds that you CANNOT get
&gt; &gt; &gt; without em Keith. Here are some tracks that he uses effects on that
&gt; &gt; &gt; you could not play otherwise;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Run Like Hell;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Marooned;

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OMFiqNA6Ag

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorrow (I don't think there is any amp you could squeal this much
&gt; &gt; &gt; Overdrive out of, pretty sure he used a Boss Digital Metaliser, shit
&gt; &gt; &gt; hot song too);

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njQtAC6EH8E

&gt; &gt; &gt; One of these days (Bass, but reputedly Gilmour played it originally);

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTrNQCYh70Y

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have a Cigar (Ohhh, mama what a song, just worked it out a couple of
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks ago;-);

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zTdND11MP4

&gt; &gt; &gt; Echoes;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any Colour you like;

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FuV42EVHJM

&gt; &gt; &gt; None of this would be possible without effects, AFAIC he uses them as
&gt; &gt; &gt; a tool. Its magic the sounds he gets, the older I get the more I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear in it, especially the early stuff. Pure genius.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And here's a couple that are pretty clean for your perusal, &quot;On the
&gt; &gt; &gt; turning away&quot; and &quot;Wish you were here;

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v240bYbbrM

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj1L5jxlY4U

&gt; &gt; &gt; He may not be fast, he may not be accurate and he may not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to cover (in most cases;-) but what he does, he does well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't think of anyone that does as well as him with what he has to
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand. And writing that stuff in the first place? That's talent;-).

&gt; &gt; As a foot note, he actually used a Pete Cornish Big Muff for &quot;Sorrow&quot;;-)
&gt; &gt; Its all about getting unique sounds from equipment that otherwise could
&gt; &gt; not be got. I use a Phaser (can't afford a Leslie) its a cool sound that
&gt; &gt; you could only get by swinging your amp around by the leads otherwise;-)

&gt; &gt; Why bother with tone controls on an amp either for that matter?

My rig is pretty simple these days. Boss chorus pedal,boss rv-3 reverb/
delay into the loop of fender roc pro 1000.ss power with tube pre. the
guitar into boss tu-2 tuner straight into input. I have two chorus
settings.very slight amount for pretty stuff and texture stuff and ovr
the top leslie ish. the delay is pretty much the same setting all the
time for that gilmour kinda thing. We are still a bar band so we do 4
hour shows and I have found i get bored of the same thing for 3 1 hour
sets,so certainly my audience must also be bored to tears with the
same basic tone all the time. I might use the delay 3 times a set and
the chorus about the same so i would not say that i am guilty of over
using the pedals. I have a bout 15 pedals or so and always end up with
e same two effects all the time. If I do a blues gig it is
simple....rosewood tele into cry baby into 59

That's an excellent point.  While the audience probably isn't bored
with particularly the same guitar tone, switching it around a bit and
using different tones certainly helps to make things more interesting
and separate songs.

&gt; Your guitar
&gt; Your amp

&gt; Your brain

&gt; 1968 when I discovered that my 30 W Ampeg  was godhead compared to the
&gt; newest piece of crap SS shit I picked up to replace it (along with

I use many effects and i see nothing wrong with it. It's done to add color
to the parts of songs. You dont have to, you can run everything dry and then
people will accuse you of being like AC/DC- always sounding the same.

It really just boils down to how its done. Too much effect can make it sound
cheesy,
not enough or none-blah. Experiment and you will find cool things with
effects.

I no more than agreed with this that I realized the truth is the first
pick-up scabbed onto an acoustic guitar in order to drive an amp was the
first guitar effect! Oh no!!! That means all solid body guitars are in point

Nope.
You can't get a Marshall gain sound from a Fender amp, or clean up a
dirty Marshall nicely. Ask Eric Johnson. ;^)

Most giggers have realized the solution to diversity is to either use
multiple amps or pedals. I go the latter route. I have no interest in
hauling a complicated multi-amp rig, or getting into ridiculous effect-
loop signal routing. For live shows I need maximum variation of tones
from minimum gear. So I get a good clean sound from my AC30, and drive
it with a pedal or two. My way works, and VERY WELL at that. Also I
can be ready to perform within 5 minutes of putting my cases on stage.
No fiddling around with knobs.

For studio work, I go for sonic simplicity. I use Vox or Fender amps
for recording clean or mildly overdriven sounds. For heavier
distortion, I generally use a Marshall or BadCat amp. Pedals are
rarely involved.

But because my live rig works so well, I can travel without an amp (if
necessary), plug into ANY clean amp, and get the full range of my live
sounds. It might not be as sweet as my own AC30, but it always works,
anywhere.

&gt; &gt; Luv ya back ;-)

&gt; &gt; Here's my take:  I'm a modeler fan, esp. for recording.  When
&gt; &gt; recording, I use a lot more FX than when playing live.  To me it's
&gt; &gt; like painting a sonic landscape.  When playing live, I prefer a
&gt; &gt; simpler approach because it's a different vibe, it's more direct,
&gt; &gt; urgent, whatever.  The audience doesn't have time to analyze the sound
&gt; &gt; as much, and I think all the FX would be wasted, plus there's no way
&gt; &gt; you can re-create an FX-heavy sound very well in a live setting.

&gt; &gt; So, to make a long story short, yes to FX for recording...keep 'em at
&gt; &gt; a minimum live.

&gt; My rig is pretty simple these days. Boss chorus pedal,boss rv-3 reverb/
&gt; delay into the loop of fender roc pro 1000.ss power with tube pre. the
&gt; guitar into boss tu-2 tuner straight into input. I have two chorus
&gt; settings.very slight amount for pretty stuff and texture stuff and ovr
&gt; the top leslie ish. the delay is pretty much the same setting all the
&gt; time for that gilmour kinda thing. We are still a bar band so we do 4
&gt; hour shows and I have found i get bored of the same thing for 3 1 hour
&gt; sets,so certainly my audience must also be bored to tears with the
&gt; same basic tone all the time. I might use the delay 3 times a set and
&gt; the chorus about the same so i would not say that i am guilty of over
&gt; using the pedals. I have a bout 15 pedals or so and always end up with
&gt; e same two effects all the time. If I do a blues gig it is

Well Mark I only took time to listen to the first one. That wasnt a pedal
and wasnt live I dont think. It was synched and created with studio
gadgetry. Notice how Pink Floyd likes to keep things nice and dark while in
concert? It makes it a bit easier to fool people. Thats the feeling that I
got from it anyway.

My old bandleader used to say, &quot;Whatever smokes yer shorts,&quot; and
that's what it really is.

When I first came back to electric guitar I was strictly a
guitar&gt;cable&gt;amp kinda guy but I've learned that in order to come
closer to &quot;my&quot; sound (whatever that is) a couple stompboxes are in
order.  Right now I got a Barber Electronics Tone Press in the front
end and a MXR ten-band graphic in the effects loop of my Traynor YCV20
tube amp.

The most important item in my equation so far is the tube amp,
mainly because tube amps usually just plain sound better (to me) than
most solid-state amps.

I also have a couple stompboxes I got back in the stoned age,
original EH Dr. Q (auto wah) and original EH Small Stone phaser, but I
gotta use 'em with caution because I trip out easy.

I'll use anything that I have to in order to recreate the tone I'm
attempting to achieve.  If I'm playing AC/DC, this means nothing but
some moderate gain from a valve amp with a bit of a scoop on the EQ.
If I'm recreating a Hendrix tune, this could mean fuzz, pitch shifter,
a rotary cabinet effect, and/or much more.  When I want a pure tone
without pedals for the sake of &quot;pure guitar&quot; playing--sort of what you
are referencing--I pick up my acoustic and don't use a pick.

Well you can't play metal with a Super. But you can if you plug a distortion
pedal into it. Theres more than one type of music you know and some reqire a
Marshall or similar type amp cranked to the hilt or a pedal in front of it

Not everybody has one.
They dont really distort the way you want when you drive them,
everytime.
reverb and tremolo are useful, but they aren't modern.. many songs
require effects.
sustain and even tone can suck at low volume.

I happen to think that's one ugly bitch to start with, so I wouldn't
really
be surprised or shocked.
Beautiful painting. Very plain girl.

However, comparison aside..
You know right at the heart of this is the fact that very few amps
I've heard sound good cranked up to the point where they'll overdrive
as much as one would want.
And the few that do have a particular kind of crunch, as anyone
familiar with different tubes will tell you, and that alone seems to
me to make your querys kinda .. well.. silly.
They don't all have the same tone circuit. You can generically 'cream'
and 'organic' them in print all you like. They don't sound the same.
And, they don't do the job.
I suppose if you bought a boogie, for example, with nine replaceable
channels, tube switching on the fly.. etc.. you might start to sound
reasonable.
But a deluxe reverb alone? for a whole gig? are you shitting me?

I dunno the fen shui you speak of.
I do know my guitar is damn quiet without the amp. And that I've
always thought the guitar and amp were the instrument.

I also feel the circuitry, the amps guts if you will, being easily
changed, (more easily than the gradual changes one experiences in
matters of taste over the years-which IS in fact the 'hands brains and
guts' you speak of above) and often changed is in fact not different
than adding a pedal at all.

IOW I already play my amp. Just as when I play my guitar I may not be
touching the pots or caps, but I control them.

I put different kinds of ovedrive/distortion at the top of the list.
Easier than having two amps, because one would need at least two types
of tubes in the pre and power amps, plus two different gain stages-
minimum, to get more than one kind of overdrive/distortion out of a
single amp and one simply can't swap tubes between tunes.

El34 is not EL84 is not 6L6 is not 5881..
people even complain of tube brands being different.

While people rave about spring reverb, they aren't all the same and
there are very good digital reverbs that are better for some songs.

Same with modulation, delays, echoes.. compression... pitch shifting
is another bird altogether, eh?

Why did Vox put a 'top boost' switch on their amps?
Why did Vox come out with a treble boost pedal way back in the
sixties?

What good is the bionix expandora billy gibbons, have you no tone!

I don't have to go as far as pink floyd to explain this.
I can just point to many many recordings where there was nothing
different but the amp itself, yet the tones are vastly different.
so obviously, one uses effects and pedals the exact same way one would
use the amp, and they do the exact same thing.
A little more, and even a little less sometimes.

I should stop that engineer before he gets any funny ideas, I
suppose.. but I wonder if I'll be able to.
He has a huge mass of circuitry .. and wait.. he's fooled me before he
even twists a knob by choosing the microphone to put in front of my
amp..
damn.. the whole industry is after our pure 'organnon' vintage tones
lewis.. call out the storm troops!

Now if I could only get people to play these recordings on the right
stereo in the right environment and be sure they were hearing with the
right brains and guts.

whoo. gets complicated when you carry this thinking further I see

I hope you read my thread regarding the week I spent with my Strat &amp;
my Pignose.

To answer your question, I consider myself a 'non-pedal' user.
However, I do use the footswitches on my amps to select between clean
and overdrive tones and reverb.  My Fender has tremolo which I never
use and the Peavey has the phase shifter that I never use.

And I added an Ernie Ball Pan Pedal to the string to pan between amps.
Other than that, I use nothing in the string.  Both amps sound good to
me and I'm comfortable dialing them in for whatever I want.

That said, using a variety of different guitars on the same amps give
a lot of different tones, but it's usually the Strat that I'm playing.

One of these days, I'm sure I'll fire up my old rack and try out all
the presets I made years ago with flangers and delays and reverbs and
choruses and etc., but I never remember any of that sounding tonally
as nice as my amps do now...

&gt;I use many effects and i see nothing wrong with it. It's done to add color
&gt;to the parts of songs. You dont have to, you can run everything dry and then
&gt;people will accuse you of being like AC/DC- always sounding the same.

&gt;It really just boils down to how its done. Too much effect can make it sound
&gt;cheesy,
&gt;not enough or none-blah. Experiment and you will find cool things with
&gt;effects.

You know what I hate?  When a guitar player switches on a distinctly
new effect between songs and he tries it out.  Completely ruins the
impact of the new sound.

Some wahs are notorious tone suckers so I can see how that could mess
up your sound, but most other pedals - particularly if they have true
bypass switches - shouldn't mess up anything unless you have a bunch
of them with buffers strung together.  If anything, it'd be the
extended cable length stealing high frequencies but that becomes a non
issue if you have at least one pedal with a buffer in your chain.

Of course, this is all moot if you mean pedals screw up your tone when
they are on. ;)

&gt; the minute you pick up an electric guitar you already have an aberration
&gt; in your hands.  So what you are saying is that somehow 'proper' tone
&gt; is derived through the use of minimal aberrations.  Electric guitar
&gt; and electrically driven amp.  Hmm.. that's 2 things too many already.

&gt; Once you plug in - anything is fair game from that point on.

&gt; Let's not delude ourselves - electric guitars are toys compared
&gt; to great acoustic and classical instruments.  So any discussion
&gt; that includes the perceived 'tone geek approved way of getting sounds'
&gt; from electric instruments is all a moot point.  It is just a tone geek's
&gt; way of validating what he or she does to make them feel good about
&gt; themselves and their gear.   It's ok though.  I understand.

&gt; We play with _toys_  and sometimes they are _very_ nice toys but please keep it
&gt; humble and in proper perspective.
&gt; I am sure the first violinist in the orchestra or perhaps a concert pianist
&gt; or maybe Segovia himself would laugh at our discussions of 'tone' and electric
&gt; instruments.  Electric instruments would be a diversionary treat at best.

&gt; Sorry - had to keep it real.  Don't get a big head on you about
&gt; tone geek approved things.  Some of the best out there indulge
&gt; themselves in all sorts of fx and pedals and even those clean
&gt; country tele players are known to have a compressor and tube screamer
&gt; always turned on and ready to go.  Gotta juice up that Fender sometimes.

&gt; I take my playing very seriously - but I like to keep it all in perspective.

&gt; So - anything goes!  This is electric fun!  There are no rules.
&gt; That's why we ROCK! and that's why we ROLL !

&gt; I refuse to buy into the tone geek approved methods all the time!
&gt; (ok. but it's still nice to know good methods sorta like a little mental
&gt;  notepad - hmmm...  what would tone geek do here ?  hmmm...
&gt;  would he plug the strat with approved lollars or fralins into the
&gt;  tone geek approved fender twin - OR - would he (OMG!) have a double fat
&gt;  hardtail Strat and then run through a tone bender fuzz and then onto
&gt;  a 4 stage old skool phaser which all goes into the Soldano and 4x12.

&gt;  Ummm.. ok.. lemme think... aha!  He should just plug the Strat with
&gt;  the approved lollar black face single coil pickups into the Fender Twin.
&gt;  which should also be equipped with the original speaker and all NOS tubes.

&gt;  (DING DING !  We have a winner!!  That's the correct tone geek approved answer!)

&gt;   Squier - you have just won a set of NOS Sylvania tubes for your Solid State Peavey!
&gt;   congratulations!

Bang on the money imho too, young fella. Its all a bit of who cares and
do what you like. Music is about creativity, and pedals can help some
people and not others. To each his own.

All a pedal does is alter tone or add delays of a kind. So we should
ditch reverb's and tone controls too? Pedals are a tool just like any
other piece of equing gear. I love the sound of a wah-wah or a phaser or
a octaver. Its a hell of a lot of fun and it adds variation, I would
hate to play the same crap all the time, I'd be bored out of my tree.

BTW I don't think Gilmour is anywhere near having/using the most
effects. Have a look at some of those multi effects things (jack of all
trades, master of none imho). My Korg Pandora II has more wizz bang
stuff than even Gilmour has on his little shelf.

But thats just me, I like THAT kinda music. So thats how I play, and I
have no illusions about how good or bad I am either.
