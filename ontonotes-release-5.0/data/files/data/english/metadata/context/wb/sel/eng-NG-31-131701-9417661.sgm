I love it too - been sucked in the past few nights. THe footage is
really cool. Still can't get over the number of casualties.

Never saw the Civil War, will need to check it out. Not much footage
available from that I assume ;0)

I'm one of those people who thought Burns did a very poor job on the
jazz documentary (for a variety of reasons) as well.  Overall, I find
his documentaries to a sort of clever brand or a glossy commercialized

I know what ya mean, they are uber-polished and have a kind of 'brand
recognition'.  But then I think of all of the research and compilation
that went in to it and I just get completely engrossed.

Of course, the amazing thing about this production is that he is able to
interview people who were actually there - telling the story in their
own words rather than in intern summarizing a chapter from a book into
the storyboard (not that that would necessarily be a bad thing!).

Yeah, I agree John.  Ken's ability to draw huge sums of money to finance
these documentaries is unprecedented.  For that reason alone, I usually
watch them and yes, even enjoy them to some extent.  They are obviously
well produced, sometimes annoyingly so.  But I'm also very weary of the
uncritical bias that exists in just about every documentary he's
produced.  Ken seems to have this idea that history only has one point
of view or that history is static.

LOVED the Civil War, LOVED Baseball, but I find this WWII one trite,
cloying, annoying, and worst of all, boring.   Hearing all about young Lars
Olsen's trip to the movies in Narvik Minnesota for 30 minutes isn't all that
fascinating.

Instead of focusing on the home front and the US individuals' involvement in
the war, Burns should have made &quot;The Nazis&quot;.   I'm sure the letters written
by Germans of the time would have been far more interesting than those
written by lovesick Ferd Burfel from Sacramento to his Rosie Riveting
girlfriend in Citrus Heights.

Yawn.    If we're gonna talk WWII, let's talk madness and earth shattering
atrocities.  Way more entertaining; not to mention educational for those
nimwits of today who think a loony crackpot like Ahmadinejad and his nation
of Iran are in any way akin to the collective insanity of the worst gang of
criminals in history and their nation of enablers known as Germany.  Burns
could have shocked millions upon millions too young to have a clue about the
Nazis and their intentional, purposeful plan to murder, plunder, and enslave
most of the world.

An opportunity wasted.

While I do agree to some degree with Toad, I am finding some of the

HRYK.

That said I've been enjoying &quot;The War&quot; - the narration of WWII as
Burns set it up here, mostly from the narrow perspective of what of
U.S. citizens and soldiers observed and experienced at the time, is
interesting and compelling to me.

I thought the _Civil War_ was the finest television documentary
ever produced. Ken Burns &amp; Co. made history come alive in a way
that few have ever matched before or since.

The Ken Burns &amp; Co. format didn't work so well for jazz and I
thought their history of baseball was just plain lame. They do
seem to have but the one tool and whether the subject is a nail,
a screw, a doorknob or a light bulb they're gonna smack it with
their hammer. Luckily for them the _Civil War_ was a nail.

From what I've seen of _The War_ so far, Ken Burns &amp; Co. are
nailing this one too.

Oh I think we can know more than chronology with a high degree of certainty,
perhaps never to perfection but we often can know who did what, where and
how they did it and sometimes even why they did it.  I've known people for

Well, to an extent, but especially in the case of people with writing we can
know an awful lot about what they believed.  When you have access to
someone's diary, their love letters, what their friends and enemies said
about them and their official record you can get a pretty good idea of how
they thought.

Burns seems to focus as much on the people involved as on the larger issues
that most historians concern themselves with, that's probably why his work
is so popular, because it speaks to our emotions in a way that so much
historical writing does not. But hell, I like Barbara Tuchman too so there's

You've hit the nail on the head. There's a certain formulaic, paint by
number quality to all of Burns' documentaries that makes each one a
little more boring than the last. As a result, I've found myself
unable to even give &quot;The War&quot; a look. Besides, I've pretty much had it
with films that glorify wars, even the so-called &quot;necessary&quot; ones. The
only good war movie is an anti-war movie.

WWII was just SO huge.

Did you know that more BRAZILIANS died fighting the Germans in Italy than
Americans have died fighting both Iraq wars combined?

Who knew Brazil was even INVOLVED in WWII?   5,000 dead just didn't make the
radar screens back then, it was a mere drop in the bucket.

Among the issues Burns has dealt with so far are the incompetence of some
senior U.S. commanders with resulting casualties and suffering by the
troops, the over-confidence and bravado that was quickly kicked out of the
U.S. Army once it met the Wehrmacht, the pointless internment of
Japanese-Americans, the shoddy treatment of black Americans (in and out of
uniform) including violence against black workers and soldiers, and the
brutal reality of combat as opposed to the sanitized version that was
presented to the American public early on.  Only someone who hasn't watched
the series could describe that as glorifying war.  And if WWII wasn't a
&quot;necessary&quot; war then there can't be such a thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cool.  I usually wait for these to come out of DVD.  I'm too impatient to

&gt;&gt; TiVo, my good man, TiVo... I generally watch Monday Night Football at like
&gt;&gt; 11pm on Monday night in about an hour...

&gt;Netflix baby.  It gives me a degree of control.  I'm unafraid to admit

It certainly doesn't glorify war. I've learned a lot about how this
supposedly &quot;good&quot; war was filled tragic mistakes in strategy and
complete disregard for the Geneva Convention on all sides. It was truly
brutal. It had gained a veneer of being not so bad by the passing of
time and the concept that it was a necessary thing to do. However, in
reality, it was fucking bloody mess. It was interesting watching the
first few episodes with my dad as he remembered it all happening when he
was a little kid. He had two brothers and a brother in law in the
service at the time, although only his brother in law saw overseas
action (he was one of the guys ferrying German prisoners to prison camps
back in the US from North Africa and Italy).

In comparison with Iraq, WWII was no cakewalk. When you lose the same
amount of people we've lost in Iraq in one battle, it's pretty serious.

I am also struck by how much the American People (that's us!) were asked
to chip into the war effort and how now, Bush wants us to forget about
it and leave it all to him and just go about our business shopping.
That's why we're never going to win in Iraq. A war isn't won just by
writing a blank check to the corporations that benefit from the action.

If he's including the USSR as being on our side (which of course they were,
carrying most of the load) I can't disagree with his statement.   Historians
estimate that up to 50% of all German women and girls living in areas
liberated by the Soviet Union were raped by the drunken conquering troops.
They also enslaved and killed literally millions of German POW's after the
war concluded.  And the Katyn Forest Massacre of Polish officers was a big
story during the war.

Considering the depth and breadth of this war, the US committed a miniscule
number of atrocities, but they did occur from time to time.   Something
rarely mentioned in US histories is how some troops reacted upon reaching
the various concentration camps liberated by US forces.   In one camp (the
name of which escapes me at the moment) a single US Army corporal lined up
over 300 SS and Ukrainian camp guards and gunned them down with a machine
gun while his unit stood by and applauded.

He simply couldn't handle the level and scale of horror perpetrated by the
Nazis.  It was unexpected by everyone who participated in liberating the
camps.

That kind of violation was, however, extremely rare and many would call it
justified.   Overall the conduct of US and British troops was exemplary, and
the treatment of German POWs held in the US and Canada bordered on being too
generous, with prisoners taking jobs off campus and even coming and going as
they pleased under some circumstances.   Compare that to the intentional
slaughter of millions of Soviet prisoners by the Germans and the horrendous
cruelty and perverted punishments including tens of thousands of beheadings
of Allied prisoners by the Japanese.

Bloody mess indeed, violations galore on all sides, but the US and Brit part
of our side performed more than admirably, especially considering the nature
of their enemies.

Of course if you want to include the intentional destruction of urban
populations via incendiary bombing of the like promoted by Brit General Sir
Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris and US General Curtis LeMay, then Edwin may have a
point, although I have no idea what the Geneva Conventions say, if anything,
about how to legally level a city.   In most cases it helped speed the end
of the war, but there are particular situations one could argue about, like
Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki.   I would come down in
favor of all of them when you consider the circumstances and the time.   But
there are good arguments against some of those operations.

Bingo! And I think I am not the only one who has been force fed too many
John Wayne movies. I think what had struck me the most was the
similarities of this war to other supposed &quot;not good&quot; wars, like Viet
Nam and Iraq. Basically, war is a horrible experience and a really
stupid way to settle differences (no, I am not saying that Hitler
shouldn't have been stopped, so don't even go there. I am also not
saying that Saddam Hussain was a good man, so don't try that, either. I
do believe that containment was working a whole lot better than what we
got now) that wastes lives and resources. I think if we had treated 9/11
as an act of international crime, we would be a lot better off than
treating everything as an act war. You can't fight a war without an
enemy country. Instead, you end up like us, creating the enemy for
everyone else to fight against.

It was more to do with soldiers on all sides taking no prisoners. There
were interviews in Boston on WGBH with some local people and it's
possible that I was mixing them up with some people in the documentary,
but more than one person said that when dealing with prisoners, some of
them were summarily executed. In some cases, it was revenge (I think
there were photos of captured Japanese that were about to be executed by
Americans.), and in the case of my uncle, an MP who escorted prisoners
from North Africa back to the states, it was expediency. When the
transportation was full, rather than deal with the overflow, they just
killed them. I don't think that we committed the worst of it, but in
war, people do extreme things and I am positive that I would as well.
There was also intimations and evidence of torture by various parties.

I wasn't talking about institutionalized breaking of treaties, but of
individual, personal, look them in the eyes kinds of war crimes. The
things that change a man forever. The things that now get our troops in
trouble. I think the mentality at the top is coming from people who
never lived it, except vicariously through John Wayne and Ronald Reagan
in the movies, and pass on down this cowboy, we can do whatever we want,
kind of behavior that was determined to be justified by WWII (it's not a
crime because we are good guys). These days, it's more complicated, or
so it seems. I think what struck me is that it was plenty complicated
back then. On the other side of it, though, I was reading about the
search for Bin Laden, and it seems that we lost him several times due to
mid level bureaucracy not signing off on attacks when they were a viable
option until it was too late. I don't think that kind of thing would
happen back then. Oh wait, it did. General Clark at Anzio comes to mind.

I agree with you 100% here. I was amazed at some of the things that
people did. I was truly impressed by the Japanese Americans, who took it
on the chin from the worst aspects of our country and yet were
unwavering in their patriotism and even ended up putting their lives on
the line for us.

I don't think we are in any disagreement here. War is hell.

&quot;There are no good wars, there are only necessary wars.&quot;

That's a paraphrased quote from a WWII vet, early in the first episode
of &quot;The War&quot;.

comment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If that was what Edwin said then you would have had a valid point
there, but it's not.  What Edwin actually said was: &quot;It had gained a
veneer of being not so bad&quot;.

The whole quote is: &quot;It [WWII] had gained a veneer of being not so bad
by the passing of time and the concept that it was a necessary thing
to do.&quot;  There is no reference to a &quot;'veneer' of conceptual necessity&quot;
there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again that's not what Edwin said.  What Edwin said is that &quot;the

Edwin's &quot;the concept that it was a necessary thing to do&quot; wording was
ambiguous and left the possibility that he thought it wasn't

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;truly brutal&quot; and a &quot;fucking bloody mess&quot; etc. doesn't negate the
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact that it was necessary that the Allies fight in it, and by my read
&gt; &gt; &gt; nowhere in Edwin's wording does he suggest otherwise.

&gt; &gt; What other interpretation would you put on the the phrase: &quot;This supposedly
&gt; &gt; 'good' war was filled [with] tragic mistakes in strategy and complete
&gt; &gt; disregard for the Geneva Convention on all sides?&quot;  What purpose do the
&gt; &gt; words &quot;supposedly 'good' war&quot; serve in this sentence other than to suggest
&gt; &gt; that the traditional claims of it being a just war are invalid?  How would
&gt; &gt; you interpret the sentence that says the war over time has acquired a
&gt; &gt; &quot;veneer&quot; of conceptual necessity, would you normally use the word &quot;veneer&quot;
&gt; &gt; to suggest something other than concealment, especially when he then
&gt; &gt; contrasts it with the &quot;reality&quot; of it being otherwise than traditionally
&gt; &gt; depicted?  And how does the suggestion that the necessity of stopping Hitler
&gt; &gt; is something that accumulated over time (rather than being apparent in the
&gt; &gt; the late 1930s) sit with you, do you consider the need to go to war with
&gt; &gt; fascism to be something that only generations of flag-waving propaganda made
&gt; &gt; us believe had to be done?  Do you accept that WWII was necessary only in
&gt; &gt; &quot;concept?&quot;

&gt; &gt; Jeez Ray, come on, that entire paragraph suggests that the traditional
&gt; &gt; depiction of WWII as a just and necessary war is open to question, the
&gt; &gt; asides about it being brutal and nasty don't alter that.

&gt; &gt; I suppose it's *possible* Edwin is discovering for the first time that the
&gt; &gt; Allied cause in WWII displayed its share of incompetence and stupidity, it
&gt; &gt; could be that by &quot;good war&quot; he means a war free of blunders and tragedies,
&gt; &gt; it's not out of the question.  I do find that somewhat astonishing however,
&gt; &gt; having relatives who fought in that war and having read perhaps more history
&gt; &gt; than most folks the frequent incompetence of the Allies in WWII and the
&gt; &gt; brutality of the combat comes as no surprise to me.  If that's the &quot;veneer&quot;
&gt; &gt; he means then it is one that should not have survived even an entry-level
&gt; &gt; history class.

&gt; Bingo! And I think I am not the only one who has been force fed too many
&gt; John Wayne movies. I think what had struck me the most was the
&gt; similarities of this war to other supposed &quot;not good&quot; wars, like Viet
&gt; Nam and Iraq. Basically, war is a horrible experience and a really
&gt; stupid way to settle differences (no, I am not saying that Hitler
&gt; shouldn't have been stopped, so don't even go there. I am also not
&gt; saying that Saddam Hussain was a good man, so don't try that, either. I
&gt; do believe that containment was working a whole lot better than what we
&gt; got now) that wastes lives and resources. I think if we had treated 9/11
&gt; as an act of international crime, we would be a lot better off than
&gt; treating everything as an act war. You can't fight a war without an
&gt; enemy country. Instead, you end up like us, creating the enemy for
&gt; everyone else to fight against.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with those statements, save for the &quot;complete disregard for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Geneva Convention on all sides&quot;.  That I haven't learned from &quot;The
&gt; &gt; &gt; War&quot; (at least not yet - I've watched 3 of the 4 broadcasts) or
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyplace else.  I may have missed that though - Edwin what are you
&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to there?

&gt; &gt; I believe there was brief mention of the bombing of cities being contrary to
&gt; &gt; international treaties.  However I also find it bizarre that anyone could
&gt; &gt; lump in the allies with Germany and Japan in this regard considering that
&gt; &gt; the allies didn't run death camps or build death railways as the Axis powers
&gt; &gt; did.  Well, Soviet Russia excepted, Stalin had killed millions with
&gt; &gt; deliberate famine (among other means) when Hitler was still working out the
&gt; &gt; theory.  But that doesn't mean that the U.S. and British Commonwealth
&gt; &gt; nations even came close to the intentional savagery and mass murder
&gt; &gt; committed by Germany and Japan, it's perverse to suggest otherwise.

&gt; It was more to do with soldiers on all sides taking no prisoners. There
&gt; were interviews in Boston on WGBH with some local people and it's
&gt; possible that I was mixing them up with some people in the documentary,
&gt; but more than one person said that when dealing with prisoners, some of
&gt; them were summarily executed. In some cases, it was revenge (I think
&gt; there were photos of captured Japanese that were about to be executed by
&gt; Americans.), and in the case of my uncle, an MP who escorted prisoners
&gt; from North Africa back to the states, it was expediency. When the
&gt; transportation was full, rather than deal with the overflow, they just
&gt; killed them. I don't think that we committed the worst of it, but in
&gt; war, people do extreme things and I am positive that I would as well.
&gt; There was also intimations and evidence of torture by various parties.

&gt; I wasn't talking about institutionalized breaking of treaties, but of

&gt; things that change a man forever.

Agreed, though acts by individuals do not amount to &quot;complete
disregard for the Geneva Convention on all sides.&quot;  Generally speaking
the Allies, excepting the Soviet Union, did considerably more than pay

did, especially the Nazis - there is no comparison.  As such your

You don't have to bring that up with me. I've got relatives who ended up
at the camps and many more who were wiped out wholesale in Lithuania. My
father's parents barely escaped with their lives, long before Hitler got
going. Germans didn't have the monopoly on killing Jews. While there are
degrees of hideousness violence, if it's happening to you, you are still
100% dead. The Germans and Japanese were responsible for starting a lot
of shit, but once you get into it, it's a moral free for all. No matter
how it's presented, I still think that killing people is a wrong way to
settle disputes. I don't mind if you call me a naive idealist!

I haven't watched &quot;the War&quot;, but the New Yorker had a scathing review
of it:

http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2007/09/24/070924crt...

pretty much summed up Ken Burns for me. And I thought we (on this
board) were in universal opinion that &quot;Jazz&quot; was a travesty, painting
Jazz as only the classic, nostalgic art (visa vie Wynton Marsalis),
and effectively skipping  the movement of free expression that found
itself in the 50's and 60's, and continues to evolve today.

As for &quot;history&quot; being &quot;truth&quot;, this is clearly not so, as shown by
Burns's documentaries. Because all important events have numerous
observers, motives, and even perceived outcomes (e.g. &quot;written by the
winners&quot;), there is really no such thing as &quot;truth&quot;. Even &quot;biography&quot;
isn't truth since personal writings rarely reflect the objective,
complete view (e.g. most diaries are outlets for a particular
frustration or dream, rather than a reflective view).

So, I suspect we will never really know the full dimensions of the
war. Clearly we can morally say that it was &quot;necessary&quot; because of the
camps and other Nazi atrocities, and the fact that we find the Nazi
ideology repellent (even when we adopt public ideologies of our own
that are not terribly dissimilar).

But was the war &quot;necessary&quot; or the &quot;correct thing to do&quot;? Because
history is written the way it is, we can't really question that. I
probably side with the &quot;it was necessary&quot; camp, despite my generally
uncompromising anti-war philosophy. But I think there are good
arguments said here to the contrary... the USSR, the cold war, the
modern American jingoism, military, and capitalism, etc... And we
shouldn't forget that until Pearl Harbor, the majority of americans
were dead against the war, and several pro-Germany (Henry Ford and
Walt Disney come to mind).

Anyway, that's my 2c on this interesting thread. I'll try to catch the
War on its replay sometime though.

Nazi Germany gets the lion's share of the blame for inhumanity in WWII
because of their Final Solution death camps.  However the fact is that Japan
was every bit as savage, they had their own death camps, used living people
for bio-warfare experiments, intentionally used contagious disease as a
weapon, and generally raped and slaughtered their way across China and other
lands with a racial arrogance every bit as nasty as that of the Nazis.

It is certainly true that some Allied soldiers took no prisoners at times
but it was a matter of battlefield expediency or personal revenge rather
than national policy.  POWs in British or American hands certainly fared
better than those in Germany and presumably the treatment of POWs by Japan
needs little description, the numbers who died in Japanese captivity speak
for themselves.

What a pointlessly snotty review, typical of the sort of critic who equates
being sarcastic and cutting with having insight.  The critic's union must

Nonsense, the truth exists whether one writer or three or a dozen have
managed to describe it or not.  History is what happened, it is not the
books and films that might or might not accurately relate what happened.
The nice thing about the study of history is that as more and more artifacts
and memoirs and documents are uncovered, as more research is done and more
informed analysis is published our understanding of what did happen can
actually improve.  We often have a long way to go in that regard, but that
doesn't mean it can't be done or that we can't trust any historian's account
because the truth is unknowable.

None of which makes WWII less necessary, what does Henry Ford's admiration
of Hitler have to do with whether or not the Nazis had to be prevented from
holding onto most of Europe?  How does a Japanese attack on America leave
room for wondering whether self-defense was necessary or not?

BTW, when you're posting from a concentration camp in the desert you can
announce that the U.S. has policies not dissimilar to those of Nazi Germany,
until then such a statement is self-indulgent theatrics.

I saw the same movies although I don't recall being force-fed, but again the
alternatives are so numerous and so easy to find that I'm simply surprised
that more folks aren't aware of more reliable accounts off WWII.  If nothing

I can sum up the invasion of Iraq in six words: wrong war, wrong time, wrong

Yes, Allied soldiers sometimes killed prisoners, that's no secret.  But the
very fact that the western Allies put hundreds of thousands of German and
Italian and Japanese prisoners into POW camps where they survived the rest
of the war should be a clue that the routine massacre of prisoners as a
matter of policy clearly does not apply to the western armies.  The Soviets
are another matter, both due to the savagery of the war on the eastern front
and the philosophical nature of the Soviet regime (which had murdered
millions of its own citizens long before Hitler arrived to help out) the
Soviets weren't especially concerned with whether captured German soldiers
survived or not.  Still, your original comment about both sides ignoring the
Geneva Convention etc. isn't supported by what happened, the scattered
killing of some captured enemy troops is nothing like the systematic
industrialized butchery used by Germany and Japan.

&gt; things that change a man forever. The things that now get our troops in
&gt; trouble. I think the mentality at the top is coming from people who
&gt; never lived it, except vicariously through John Wayne and Ronald Reagan
&gt; in the movies, and pass on down this cowboy, we can do whatever we want,
&gt; kind of behavior that was determined to be justified by WWII (it's not a
&gt; crime because we are good guys).
">

Such behavior is generally discouraged by professional soldiers because it
is bad for what the military calls good order and discipline, in other words
troops who get away with rape and looting and murder are at risk of becoming
unreliable.  It is no coincidence that when armies break the rot often
begins away from the front lines, in rear-area formations with poor
discipline.  But as you suggest, the chain of command has to convincingly
discourage such behavior and root it out ruthlessly to make sure it is kept
to a minimum.

&gt; On the other side of it, though, I was reading about the
&gt; search for Bin Laden, and it seems that we lost him several times due to
&gt; mid level bureaucracy not signing off on attacks when they were a viable
&gt; option until it was too late. I don't think that kind of thing would
&gt; happen back then. Oh wait, it did. General Clark at Anzio comes to mind.
">

Oh my, the list of blunders and arrogance and stupid policies among the
Allies in WWII would fill a library, and probably has.  Anzio is just one of
many, many such, you could spend the rest of your life reading about them if
you wished.  That's one of the things I like about The War, it doesn't try
to conceal the sheer stupidity America often displayed in WWII, that's just
another reason why I don't think it &quot;glorifies&quot; the war as some other folks
have claimed.

&gt; I agree with you 100% here. I was amazed at some of the things that
&gt; people did. I was truly impressed by the Japanese Americans, who took it
&gt; on the chin from the worst aspects of our country and yet were
&gt; unwavering in their patriotism and even ended up putting their lives on
&gt; the line for us.
">

Yeah, amazing, ditto with indians and blacks and latinos and so on, people
who hadn't exactly been treated real well and yet stepped up to bat when the
call came.  That's another thing that I really hate about the Iraq war, that
it has pissed away the willingness of Americans to shoulder such a burden
when asked, who will be able to blame people for declining to join the
National Guard in future considering the pointless waste of their talents
and lives in Iraq?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't think we are in any disagreement here. War is hell.

Oh yeah, the irony being that some of the finest behavior our species is
capable of comes from the most vile activity we indulge in.

Well, they did do a little of that, but barely.  But I found it amazing
how little time they gave to the likes of mainstream jazz artists like
Bill Evans or Paul Desmond.  I'm actually not a big Bill Evans fan, just
because the Marsalis/Crouch camp didn't dig him doesn't mean Evans
wasn't a major influence on jazz musicians, particularly from a harmonic
standpoint.  And what about Herbie Hancock's career?  He was mentioned
only briefly as a Miles Davis sideman (same as Evans).  Then there's one
of the most popular acoustie jazz musicians of the 70's, Keith Jarrett.
Nothing significant.  In fact, the documentary acted as if acoustic
jazz didn't even exist in the 70's until Marsalis himself rescued jazz
from the evil clutches of jazz fusion.  Bah!

&gt; Nonsense, the truth exists whether one writer or three or a dozen have

&gt; books and films that might or might not accurately relate what happened.
&gt; The nice thing about the study of history is that as more and more artifacts
&gt; and memoirs and documents are uncovered, as more research is done and more
&gt; informed analysis is published our understanding of what did happen can
&gt; actually improve.  We often have a long way to go in that regard, but that
&gt; doesn't mean it can't be done or that we can't trust any historian's account
&gt; because the truth is unknowable.

I could be wrong here, but I think the study of history is an academic
exercise that is very aware of its own variable views of &quot;things as
they happened&quot;. And in the age of Einstein, it seems a little unaware
to claim that the &quot;truth exists&quot;.
Most things worthy of historical analysis rarely have a singular
truth...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But was the war &quot;necessary&quot; or the &quot;correct thing to do&quot;? Because
&gt; &gt; history is written the way it is, we can't really question that. I
&gt; &gt; probably side with the &quot;it was necessary&quot; camp, despite my generally
&gt; &gt; uncompromising anti-war philosophy. But I think there are good
&gt; &gt; arguments said here to the contrary... the USSR, the cold war, the
&gt; &gt; modern American jingoism, military, and capitalism, etc... And we
&gt; &gt; shouldn't forget that until Pearl Harbor, the majority of americans
&gt; &gt; were dead against the war, and several pro-Germany (Henry Ford and
&gt; &gt; Walt Disney come to mind).

&gt; None of which makes WWII less necessary, what does Henry Ford's admiration
&gt; of Hitler have to do with whether or not the Nazis had to be prevented from
&gt; holding onto most of Europe?  How does a Japanese attack on America leave
&gt; room for wondering whether self-defense was necessary or not?

Nothing, I was merely pointing out that during the time of WWII, it
wasn't a straightforward decision. After the fact in the historical
&quot;truth&quot; is that it was...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BTW, when you're posting from a concentration camp in the desert you can

Pedestrian perhaps, but hardly self-indulgent... I'll take a poll next

I love anything Ken Burns does. Saw a glimpse of this series the other
night and am Joneseing to pick up the DVD. He's got a tremendous,
unbiased, eye for history. Love Ken.

&gt; &gt; Ken Burns just blows your mind every project he takes on.This

&gt; I found the civil war one ALOT less interesting.  I think it has

&gt; I feel kind of shallow saying it, but it's true...

&gt; I was actually avoiding this series because of how much I disliked the
&gt; civil war one, but once I started watching, I was hooked.  Top notch!

I think the appeal of the Civil War series for me was the &quot;letters&quot;
and the narrative. The narrative of the letters, from either the Blue
or Grey, made it real and &quot;today&quot;. But hey, I'm a history junkie.
