Does anyone know if there have been any studies/polls that measure what
the "general public" thinks of as a "scary" dog?

I'm ruling out the most obvious that I 'hear' about (Pit Bulls,
Dobermans, and Rottweilers) for the purposes of this post.

In the future (next year or so) I want to add another dog to our family
and I want a dog that, on looks alone, will be a deterrent to any
uninvited person attempting to enter our fenced yard/closed gate.

I am not looking for a dog who will be aggressive, but rather a dog
who, if outside in the yard and someone was thinking of coming over the
fence, would bark and frighten just by appearance.   If they growled
that would be great too but I'm not counting on it.  This dog will be a
family member just like our other two.  The "scary" factor will just be
an added bonus.   The dog will have access to both yard and inside via
a doggy door, no "outside dogs" here at our house.

My lab mix, although black and about 60 lbs, is obviously not "scary"
looking as I've had 3 people come uninvited into my gated yard within
the past year while she was right there barking her head off, but while
she goes "nuts" barking, she retreats the entire time.  Once the cable
guy, another the water company guy, and a third time some dummy that
the landlady sent over to inspect the roof without warning me first.
All three just waltzed on in without ringing the bell even though I
have a doorbell on the gate clearly saying "Please ring bell!". &gt;:-(
I'm guessing they saw that she's a lab and assumed she was all bark, no
bite (and they were correct).   Lucky for them she didn't get out and
get lost or I'd be the one to fear!  Anyway, I don't want a "biter", I
want a dog that people will ASSUME might bite and not chance it.

I will repeat that I don't want a dog that is by nature going to be
difficult to "control" (natural aggression/dominance issues).... I want
a large dog that is a "big baby" but still scares the pants off someone
who doesnt' know the dog.

Boxers? Great Danes?  What else "looks scary" that I've overlooked?

It may not scare visitors itself, but the crazy factor alone should
do wonders for making anyone think twice before entering your
property.

I always think of Mastiffs when I hear the term 'gentle giant.'  But I am

known.

My neighbor has 2 very sweet Great Danes and NO ONE goes in her yard when
they are out, though they could.

It seems to me that it would be cheaper and easier to put a lock on
the gate than to get a new dog.  And, really, if folks are able to
come into your yard at random, a lock is needed for the dogs'
safety.  Getting a new dog, unless they really *want* another dog,
is not the way to go about it.  Besides, there's always going to be
someone out there who is not afraid of their big, bad baby.

Case in point:  The first time I was hired to house sit my mom's
neighbor's Great Danes, they had to leave town before I had a
chance to go over and meet the dogs.  I was left a key and
instructions, and that's it.  The dogs just about slobbered me to
death when I went in the door.  I can't say that I found the
presence of three dogs who were *each* larger than I am to be
scary.  At all.

I agree.  I have locks for my gates but never lock them since my dogs
aren't outside without me.

If someone wants on your property with malicious intentions and is afraid
of your dog, I'm guessing they will kill your dog regardless of its size.

People who come to our house are always leery of our GSD's.  Oddly
enough, they tend to be more afraid of Gunther than Molly even though
Molly is very protective while Gunther has never met a person he didn't
want to walk right up and talk into petting him.

Good grief.

With the exception of the Mastiff/Great Dane recommendation, what was
the point of most of those other replies?

Don't you people think that perhaps I'm wanting another dog because
first and foremost I WANT ANOTHER DOG, love dogs, and figure while I'm
AT it I might get one that "looks intimidating"?  Not as a "lock
replacement"?  Benefit of the doubt, please?

FYI, I have a lock on the gate, but we mostly lock it up when we LEAVE.
The dogs are in/out at their leisure and it's not feasible with six
people in the family and someone coming/going at all times to
constantly be locking/unlocking the gate.  We lock it when we are all
going to be gone at once and at night after everyone is home/settled.

I work from home and while it's not possible to always lock it up
because someone else will be home soon or is just running to the store,
when I'm home alone I'd still like to feel a bit better about the
likelihood of someone walking in the gate.  We currently rent so we are
unable to modify to have the type of lock(s) we'd really prefer.  That
will change in the near future (buying a house most likely).  I was not
thinking of getting another dog until then.

As for the example of the Great Danes that the poster was not fearful
of... well if I'd been hired to go to someone's home and they felt
totally comfy with me walking in to their yard and didn't warn me to
the contrary, I'd *assume* there was no need to fear the dogs either.
That's quite different from approaching a stranger's house.

As for someone killing my dogs, while that is a HORRIFYING thought, my
goal is not really about trying to deter the rare and random evil
homicidal maniac.  I want to keep out everyone who cannot show some
basic respect for my home, property, and personal space (i.e. ring the
damn doorbell, for example, and a closed gate should be enough when
there is a doorbell outside it) and who has no business in my yard.  If
they have no appointment,  no invitation, no suitable business purpose
(i.e. meter reading), then they have no business in my yard.    Call me
territorial.

In the instances I mentioned this year about people in the yard, all
three "violators" had my phone number, had access to a perfectly
working doorbell, could have rang the bell or called or both and I
would have gladly met them and escorted them in.   It was just rudeness
and stupidity that caused them to just waltz on in.  None had
appointments or anything like that.  Having had unfortunate experience
related to  stalking and domestic violence in the past, this sort of
rudeness sends my anxiety levels through the roof and it's unnecessary.

I want to be in my home safe in the knowledge that for the most part
there is no chance of someone peeking in windows (happened), banging on
the "wrong" door in a drunken stupor (happened), or trying to sell me
something.  A *combination* of fences/locks/security AND a dog who
happens to look "menacing", when the dog is outside of course, would
accomplish this purpose.

The people who've recently sauntered in, and people like them,  are my
"targets" here.  No, I dont' want anyone getting bit, I just want
people to think twice, use the doorbell, pick up the phone and CALL to
say they are coming, that sort of thing.  Random solicitors, public
service workers, Jehovah's witnesses, etc.

I adore my dogs, they are part of my family, and I would never "use"
them for the sole purpose of "security" nor have I ever had an "outside
dog".  I just don't see any reason why it (size, appearance) shouldn't
be considered as a bonus when choosing a new pet, and since I am fond
of large and small breeds equally, why not?

Mine anyway, was to dispute the assertion that a Dane would be a deterrent,
since my dog that even kids fearlessly approach is a Great Dane.  The other,
that most people seem afraid of is a German Shepherd mix.

I realize that you said to omit dogs of certain breeds, but I don't know
very many people who'd mess with German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans,
etc., all of which can be wonderful companion animals and deterrents because
of their breeds.  When someone broke into my brother's apartment and SIL was
looking for a doggie deterrent (similar to yours, should look scary enough
but not actually be scary), I suggested a big, black dog, which is what they
ended up with.  The dog is a total goofball, but people cross the street
when they are walking him.

I can understand your concerns.  No one goes in my yard without my
advance permission with the exception of the meter reader.  I'd be beyond
annoyed if anyone did.

I have a 34 lb mutt who wouldn't hurt a soul.  Once when I was working
from home the meter reader knocked on the front door and asked me to
bring her in (I was on the deck but he couldn't see me).  I appreciated
him doing that and told him so, because I'd be horrified if he
accidentally let her out.  He said she scared him, but I figure he was
probably afraid of most dogs since she's so unintimidating.

I'm sure you know this, but make sure you thoroughly research whatever
breeds you are considering.  I would LOVE to have a Mastiff, but honestly
don't think I could handle having a 180 lb dog.  I think about how I will
manage a large dog when he gets near the end of his life and might need
physical assistance from me so even an 80 lb dog might be tough.

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not about to recommend a

A large, "scary" looking dog isn't necessarily going to make you
any safer.  An alarm system might.  Locking the gate might.
However, there's no accounting for what sort of dog might or might
not deter a potential trespasser.  There is also no way to predict
what a potential trespasser who is intent on doing you harm might
do to any dog who got in his way.  In an unsecured yard, your dogs
are vulnerable.

If that's the case, and you will be waiting to resolve the issue
until after you move, then why are you looking to fix the problem

The dogs didn't know me from Adam, and put on quite a display of
barking.  Quickly accompanied--as soon as I was inside the house--

skin.  I'd like to think I'm pretty good at reading dog body
language, so a large "scary" looking dog isn't likely to deter me
if I can clearly see that it has no interest in acting aggressively
toward me.  If I were intent on doing someone harm, and such a dog
were in their yard, do you really think its presence would make me

Having a large "scary" looking dog (I'm still not even sure what
that *means*) is still no insurance against those folks gaining
entry to your property.

Also, consider that if someone does enter your yard, and your dogs
are out there unsupervised, there is a risk of them hurting your
dogs or of your dogs hurting them.  Leaving an open gate, even if
it has a sign on it to ring a bell, may not relieve you of legal
responsibility if your dog bites someone.  Worse, what if a kid
enters your yard and is hurt?

That's a serious consideration.  There are several large breeds I

I would think so.  I think the OP said they already have a large
black mutt, though, and that it's not enough of a deterrant.  It
seems to me that if a large black mutt isn't doing the trick, not
much else is likely to.

Did you use anything to help transport him, such as a sling under his
belly?  or was he completely helpless?  60 lbs of a dog who cannot help you

It's one of those things that probably would never have occurred to

That's what happened in my case.  It was a sudden-onset emergency,

Oh, Shelly, I'm sorry.  That all must have been terribly difficult.

When our LabXShep, Raven died, my husband struggled to carry her up the
hill to bury her.  He's a big strong guy but Raven weighed over 100 lbs.
So that's why I think about these things when I think about these things.
(How's that for beautiful grammar?)

Some kind of lift wouldn't be a bad idea to have on hand for a small person
with a large dog, just in case.  I just can't picture exactly what...

I have picked Khan up, although I am only about 20 pounds heavier than he
is.  It is not something I'd choose to do, but it is something I can do if I
have to.  However, I'm not sure I can hoist him long enough to get him out

Actually, Molly is far darker.  Gunther is your classic mostly brown with
some black mixed in GSD.  Molly is black with only some tan.  I don't have
a website up, but here are links to Gunther's picture from the rescue I got
them from:

http://www.coastalgsr.org/gunther.htm

Molly's picture is in there, but if you do the Molly.htm, it is a different
Molly.  Look at the 2005 adoptees, down toward the end of the page and
she's there in the big list of pictures.  Black face, radar ears.
Actually, she looks a little goofy in the picture, but she never ever looks
like that around the people who are afraid of Gunther.  That's a pure
playing with family only look.

http://www.coastalgsr.org/GSR-Adopted_2005.htm

Gunther also has a goofy look on his face and his ears don't stick straight
up at attention like he's watching your every move, like Molly's do.  He is
about 20 pounds heavier and has a stockier build, so maybe she looks more
refined or something.  I don't know.  She's usually the one that is barking
while he is just sitting there waiting for the person at the door to come
in so he can figure out how to convince them to pet him.

Relax. Some folks were merely trying to add a bit of levity. Its not
easy to give an objective answer to your question. No one here knows
you. You might be a bit anti social--which is probably okay with most
folks here. However, you also seem very easily riled, and I don't think
dogs should be around such folks.

Do you happen to have one of those "Beware of Dog" signs on your gate or

"Please, ring bell" sign would probably stop me. If the doorbell failed,
and I truly needed to speak with you, your dog's appearance--including
teeth--would probably not stop me.

I see that the folks you're most interesting in repelling are, let's
say, average; which means they are more of an annoyance than a threat.
Size and shape will repel most folks; however, little yappers, which
serve as "alerters" or alarms, would probably be best for you. A nervous
Chihuahua or a territorial terrier should work well for you.

From observation, dogs with dark, preferably black, muzzles are more
intimidating that dogs with white or blond muzzles. A dog with dark eyes
and a dark muzzle works great because their face is hard to read. Hair
over the eyes can work.

I think perhaps my dog Muttley may fit the image of a scary dog, and he has
backed that up (unfortunately) with inappropriate use of his teeth. You can
read more about him and see what he looks like at
www.smart.net/~pstech/MuttleyStory.htm . It is possible that he had been
bred by drug dealers to have the characteristics of other dogs thought of
as intimidating or scary: German Shepherd, Chow, Boxer, and Pit Bull. He is
a solid, powerful 75 lb or so, and has a large head with a black mask, and
brown eyes. He was a rescue from a bad neighborhood in Baltimore, and he
was an Alpha pack master of 3 other dogs including a black Lab and a
Rotweiler.

He is not really a terribly dangerous or aggressive dog, but he has shown
some very serious dog aggression, and he did bite someone after he was
unintentionally provoked. He has calmed down a lot since I got him nearly a
year ago, and he has met many new people without problems. However, he is
initially a bit fearful, and is usually somewhat aloof, even with me. In
that behavior he seems almost a bit wolf-like, as I noticed with a friend's
half-wolf. He was a nice animal, but his rather cold and distant, almost
feral, stare was slightly intimidating and commanded respect.

If you really want a dog that might scare people to keep their distance, I
would suggest checking with Animal Control, shelters, and Humane Societies
for dogs who have not had good luck being homed. Look for a dog that is
large, obviously powerful, and somewhat wolf-like in size and demeanor. You
don't want a truly dangerous dog, but one who is initially wary of you is
likely to scare off a stranger. You don't want a dog that instantly takes
to you and acts goofy and subservient. Such a dog might make a wonderful
pet but will not be what you want. The only problem I see with a dog like
Muttley is that he may be very aggressive toward your other dog, and it
could get ugly if he wants to assert dominance.

I'm really a novice with dogs, and have been criticised a lot here, but I
think I have done a good job with Muttley and he is now family. And the
only thing I fear when walking him at night is that he could get loose and
cause injury to someone or another pet, so I must take precautions and will
need to work with him and probably a good trainer or behaviorist.

Good luck,

Paul and Muttley.

Yes, at 75 pounds, I reckon Muttley would be intimidating! A face that
dark is really hard to read, especially in low light.

I'm curious about why your fear of him getting loose, etc., is at night.
Is it because he is so dark in color? I have a black Chow Chow; so, I
have a very similar concern. I'm not very afraid of what Tang might do,
but terrified of what might be done to him. Sophie, my Chow
Chow--Pekingnese mix is a different story. I believe she would chase a
grizzly bear.

I was just thinking, an Akita, with the right coloring, would be
intimating. They are one of my favorites.

I hope you are proud of what  you're achieving with Muttley.

I can vouch for the black dogs being scary to others. Plus evidently

Well, I think s/he said it was a retriever mix -- Queenie, who is the

Better yet, search the rpd* archives.  You're more likely to get an

Ya know what?  I'm a little squicked out by your fetishization of
Muttley's "powerfulness."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He is not really a terribly dangerous or aggressive dog, but he

He was *not* provoked.  He bit the person as they were walking
*away*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, he is initially a bit fearful, and is usually somewhat
&gt; aloof, even with me. In that behavior he seems almost a bit
&gt; wolf-like, as I noticed with a friend's half-wolf. He was a nice
&gt; animal, but his rather cold and distant, almost feral, stare was
&gt; slightly intimidating and commanded respect.

Again, with the fetishization.  Also, there is nothing remotely
"wolf-like" about Muttley.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You don't want a truly dangerous dog, but one who is initially
&gt; wary of you is likely to scare off a stranger. You don't want a
&gt; dog that instantly takes to you and acts goofy and subservient.
&gt; Such a dog might make a wonderful pet but will not be what you
&gt; want. The only problem I see with a dog like Muttley is that he
&gt; may be very aggressive toward your other dog, and it could get
&gt; ugly if he wants to assert dominance.

Telling someone to seek out a hinky dog for faux protection is
pretty crappy advice, I think.

Finally, he tells a truth!

You've done some sort of job with him, that's for sure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the only thing I fear when walking him at night
&gt; is that he could get loose and cause injury to someone or

You should maybe put down the bong.  You can't even be bothered to
secure him properly during the day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

And another lie!  You have no intention of dealing with a good
trainer or behaviorist.  It seems to me that you are too attached
to Muttley just the way he is to change anything.

Thank you.  I have this nervous, dare I say sick habit of laughing
and making jokes at inappropriate times.  So, really, it wasn't as
bad as it *could* have been.  And it happened very quickly, so I
didn't have time to get too upset.  Then, after it was over, I had
a weird sense of "Did that really just happen?"  It was the middle
of the night when he died, so I wrapped him up in a blanket and
dragged (couldn't lift him!) him onto the front deck.  I sat with
him for the rest of the night, watching the stars.  When dawn
started to break, I felt kind of silly, but then it occurred to me
that sitting with the dead is a traditional thing to do.  And, star
watching is *always* appropriate.

That's really shocking to me, as you might imagine. I wonder if they

the general population.

I really love dogs of all kinds and colors, and it's at least partially
accidental that all three of mine are black (only the 3rd was
intentionally meant to "match"). But it all started with Zoe, who was the
cutest little pup -- when she played she really looked like a little
black bear cub! And people tell me all the time how gorgeous Queenie is.
So why this strange prejudice, I wonder?

I do too.  Usually, they just tend to blend together.  I had a student
several years ago, who when asked (standard form) why he chose his
dog, his answer was "it was the only dog in the shelter that wasn't
black".  Hmmm.

We all have preferences, but I think en masse, they tend to all start
to look too similar (most tend to be smooth to medium hair, labbish
dogs).

*I* love black dogs!  I only have 2 colors of dogs - they're either
black or they're gold.  No variance.  Can't imagine that ever
changing.

And I thought that was so often the case -- people I've known who have
loved dogs have mostly (maybe 80% of them, I'd say) loved big dogs and
thought small ones were somehow less "dog-like." Someone just asked me
yesterday if Max was less dog-like than bigger dogs. I said not really,
he has all the big dog behaviors. It's true he's a silly piece of fluff,
but then Queenie is too -- just six times the size. And somewhat less
fluff.

I suppose a big, untrained shelter dog clamoring for attention or, worse,
barking when approached might seem a bit daunting to an adopter -- so
maybe the adoption environment also contributes to the problem.

Sometimes we have a bunch of unadoptables who are being held for court
cases.  Maybe they were part of the evidence for a prosecution.  Or they

This was about 15 years ago and my recollection is that they
had identified them as "unadoptable" because experience
had shown that big black dogs didn't get adopted.  That is
to say, it's not that they were rogue dogs or bad dogs, it's
that they were big black dogs.  I do think that shelter
operations have gotten a lot more "enlightened" over the
past decade or so.
