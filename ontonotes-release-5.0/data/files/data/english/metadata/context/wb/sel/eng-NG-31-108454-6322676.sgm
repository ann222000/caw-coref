Introduction

Ali Sina is a rabid anti-Islamic zealot. He considers Muslims to be animals even though he was born into a Muslim family!

He advocates the indiscriminate killing of Muslims by the US forces even using nuclear weapons and an outspoken advocate of US terrorism around the world.

Despite being a Gentile he is outspoken supporter of the ethnic cleansing process in Palestine. He holds no restraint when it comes to using derogatory and abusive language to describe Islam, Prophet Muhammad PBUH and the Muslims under the banner of a freethinker.

His hate-filled website is full of superficial and reactionary anti-Islamic outbursts. His stated aim is take people out of Islam and yet the most conspicuous omission in his website is an elaboration of the alternative to Islam.

Ali Sina views are typical of the self-proclaimed free-thinkers and liberals. He challenged Muslims for a $50,000 debate which was ignored by Muslims. However, Yamin Zakaria considered taking his challenge as an opportunity to expose the myths, misinformation and plain nonsense these enemies of Islam spread about Islam. This debate covers many points that we hear is isolation at various forums and read in various articles and papers on daily basis.

YAMIN ZAKARIA'S First message to Ali Sina

Who will be adjudicating the debate? What proof do we have that you will pay up when you have been defeated ?

Can we also get a glimpse of what you propose as ALTERNATIVE? It is very easy to call people ugly whilst hiding behind a mask. If you judge ISLAM to be incorrect you must have pre-defined set of critera, values and principles by which you judge. Otherwise the 'debate' is merely where you have setup your self as judge, jury and executioner.

May I ask you also, that since you have this amount of money to give away does this mean you have financial and political backings from certain quarters ? Or are you just wealthy?

Whilst in debate can you maintain a level of decorum as opposed to name calling, of which there are many examples on your website e.g. calling someone "subhuman". As you can appreciate such labels can also be attributed towards yourself.

ALI SINA's First response

Hello Mr. Yamin Zakaria

I will be glad to debate with you on Islam. As for the payment after being defeated you must take me for my word and if you don't, you are not required to debate. One thing I can assure you of is that I am not a gambler. If I had any doubt in my mind, even as little as one in a billion chance of being wrong, I would not have risked confronting a savage and unforgiving deity such as Allah and facing the possibility of his eternal tortures. I had my share of doubts at first, but as I read and I understood more those doubts dissipated and when I started my Internet campaign six years ago, my conviction about the fallacy of Islam was as certain as my conviction about the roundness of the Earth

So Mr. Zakaria, you don't have to be too concerned about securing the money because you can bet your life that you are going to lose this debate and I will prove once again that Muhammad was not a prophet but a successful cult leader no different from Jim Jones or David Koresh and much more cruel than Hitler.

Yes, I do have a better alternative to Islam but I am not here to tell people what path they should choose. I leave that to them to decide. Almost anything is better than Islam. All I want to tell them is that Islam is dangerous and we must get rid of it soon or the world will face a major catastrophe much worse than the Second World War. Personally, I am a practitioner of the Golden Rule. The reason I oppose Islam is because it is totally against the Golden Rule. Islam is wicked in its core and it is destructive. I do not oppose Islam because it is false but because it is evil. I have no problem with people who love to believe in fairytales. But when their fairytale fills them with hatred of their fellow humans and encourages them to shed the blood of the innocent people, then I take the stance. That is not the kind of fairytale I can tolerate nor I would accept your right to believe in it. You must end this insanity and stop killing people or we will have to stop you.

No, I am not wealthy by any standard. The money I am offering comes from the equity in my house. I have made this offer to get your attention. This is to prove to the Muslims that the reason their scholars shun me is not because they think what I say is not relevant or not important but because they know they have no chance of winning the debate with me. The fact that you have accepted this challenge is a good harbinger of your honesty. I hope this honesty will assist you to see the light and leave Islam.

However, I made a search with your name and read a few passages of your articles and gave up on that illusion very soon. I am afraid your heart is filled with Islamic hate and you have no regards for truth, fairness, love and mankind. You have a very twisted sense of morality and your entire articles do nothing but to provoke hate, justify violence and divide mankind. You are indeed a true follower of Muhammad and an enemy of humanity. Nonetheless, I consider debating with you beneficial. I have no interest in you Sir. I am after my fellow humans who erroneously think they are Muslims. Fortunately, they are the majority and it is they whom I want to reach and help to make the leap from Islam to humanity. By debating with you publicly, I can make them see the stupidity of Islam and hopefully many would see the light and leave this cult.

Yes Sir, I will maintain the level of decorum even if you don't. In fact one way I win is to show my readers that Muslims can't debate without resorting to ad hominem. Very few Muslims can control the temptation of personal attacks. Those few who succeed have my utter admiration and respect.

As for calling someone "subhuman" I have made it clear that I do not consider those who behead people or target civilians and engage in senseless acts of terror, humans. There are many verses of the Quran that encourage the Muslims to engage in such savageries and inhumane acts. Those who follow such teachings are not humans and we should stop this stupid game of political correctness and call them as such. They are savages. They are less than subhumans. They are monsters, beasts and vampires. Our humanity is determined by our humanness and that is in the strength of our soul, in our concern for our fellow beings, in our care and love for mankind and not by our appearance. Can Hitler be called human? How about his supporters who perpetrated those barbarities and followed his orders? I do not know what is your answer to that but mine is, NO! You can't be called a human if you have no humanity in you. By the same token, neither Muhammad can be called a human nor those who live by his mandates, kill, loot, rape, behead and butcher innocent human beings targeting the most vulnerable and defenseless.

Do you have any problem with this definition? Do you think this is a condition you can't accept? Are you demanding that I should drop such characterization before you engage in debate with me? In that case you don't have to. Not only I will not retract, I actually hope the entire world adopt this definition and denounce the Quran as a barbarian book of terror and all those who follow its inhumane teachings as a subhuman species. I want to end this damn political correctness "lest we hurt the sensibilities" of a bunch of thugs and terrorists. I want the whole world call the spade a spade and stop this dangerously foolish game of appeasement. If I considered Islam to be a humane religion why would I oppose it?

So, do not see this as labeling but as a charge. If I make such claim, I must be able to prove it and if you want me to withdraw it you must be able to disprove it.

Let us make this a rule: Each one of us is free to make any assumption that he pleases but he must be able to prove that assumption or withdraw it. I think this is fair. This would give either one of us the right to say whatever we want to say without any restriction, BUT we must prove it or take it back. That is freedom of speech with responsibility.

You'll find that in the course of our debate I will call Muhammad an assassin, a lecher, a rapist, a highway robber and many other things. These are not insults. These are charges. It is up to me to prove these charges or apologize for them and withdraw them. Once I prove either one of these charges, you may want to attempt and disprove them or plead no contest. We will go from topic to topic. I will lay the charges on Muhammad and the Quran and present my proof. Then it is up to you to rebut those charges. At the end we don't have to agree. It is up to our readers to be the judge.

I will publish all our correspondence in my site. You are free to do the same in yours. If you don't, our readers may interpret this as your lack of confident in your ability to win this debate. But it is entirely up to you to publish them or not. If you don't have a site, send them to Al Jazeera who so often publish your hate laden articles.

I trust you find these rules fair and equitable. After all if my charges are nothing but libel, you'll be able to demonstrate that. In that case I will remove that charge. If you can disprove all the charges, you have my word that I will sell my house and give you the money that I have promised. This is a public statement and I am a quasi public figure known to a few million people. If I don't keep my word, this would be the end of me. Furthermore, I will remove all the pages of this site with the exception of the index page with a message saying I have been proven wrong by Mr. Yamin Zakaria and to honor my word this entire site has been removed. On the other hand, if you lose, you don't have to do anything. You can continue digging your heel in your ignorance and promote your hatemongering religion of terror and darkness. So as you see, you have nothing to lose while I am risking everything. The rules of this debate are totally in your favor, except for the fact that you are standing on a very shaky ground of faith and conjecture and are armed by an air gun that makes only noise, while I am standing on a solid ground of facts and my logical gun is loaded with real ammunition. In other words, you defend Islam from the position of belief and irrationality and I attack it from the position of logics and truth.

If you agree to continue, please let me know and I will bring my first charge against Muhammad.

YAMIN ZAKARIA's First reply

Please note where I have used bold and italics inside quotes to highlight Mr. Sina's quotations in his previous response.

a) You (Ali Sina) say that I must take your word as being the judicator as well as the opponent, oh really! This is surely a laughable and a farcical position, it is like saying one of boxers in the ring should also be the referee. Then expect the other boxer to take his word when the final scoring is done! Is this how you understand objectivity and fair play? Or is this coming from your "logical gun" ? This reminds me of one my recent debate with a 'disciple' of yours who after a while started to delete my email response without reading them (by his own admission) and kept sending me his rants and outbursts.

Rather, this demonstrates that you are not serious about the money and you are using it to get cheap publicity. Since you want to be the final judicator, for sure you are not "gambling" with anything but standing on "very shaky ground of faith" in fear of my "logical gun" that any impartial observer would easily see applying basic common sense! It also demonstrates arrogance on your part thinking that you can be Judge, Jury and Executioner all at the same time. Perhaps this is our first glimpse into your "position of logics and truth" that you so proudly boast about!

What I proposed was FAIR - We appoint or agree on judicator(s) and I would like to further propose that we have a binding contract through our solicitors who will hold the money into a neutral account. We should limit the number of exchanges then the judicators should pronounce the verdict. In the UK we have a saying "put your money where your mouth is". Please clarify this important point.

b) You say the following with respect to providing mankind an alternative to Islam:

"Yes, I do have a better alternative to Islam but I am not here to tell people what path they should choose. I leave that to them to decide."

You have a mysterious alternative but you do not elaborate on this at all although this is exactly what I asked for in my first email. This is Deja vou for me. In any case, from the above one line 'elaboration' your alternative seems to be rather contradictory. What if the people decided to choose the path of ISLAM by your criterion of letting people decide freely? Then by your 'logic' your opposition is not to the ideas of ISLAM as long as they have exercised their free choice in selecting that path. But, then you contradict yourself when you later deny that right of free choice as you say: "nor would I accept your right to believe in it" i.e. Islam. You sound a like a confused person standing on "very shaky ground of faith and conjecture" .

How can you say: " I am not here to tell the people what path they should choose . I leave that to them to decide" and then you contradict yourself by dictating that they should not choose the path of ISLAM as you later say "nor would I accept your right to believe in it" ? This indicates that you are confused on the fundamental basis of your argument.

Furthermore, when invoking criticism by rational necessity you must have what is right in your mind to criticise with in the first place. Otherwise you are like a masked man that calls everyone else ugly!

HENCE PLEASE NOTE: We do need a comprehensive elaboration on your alternative to pursue a serious debate as we can only get meaningful discussion when you know what each side stands for - this is particularly vital for the audience.

And it seems you fear to provide alternative as you will end up contradicting yourself just like I have already demonstrated, as it is self-evident from your statements.

c) You then go on to say "Almost anything is better than Islam". So surely you must have a set of values to judge Islam by otherwise it is empty rhetoric typical of a bigot, blinded by hate. To classify something as evil or good you need define and elaborate your criteria of assessing good and evil . Something is not evil simply because you say so!

You refer to the crimes of the Second World War. By your criterion of letting people to choose freely, there should be no objection if they chose the likes of Hitler again! So what exactly are you espousing Mr Sina? Again does this not show you are indeed a confused man or a woman? Or is that your position on "logic and truth" ! Please elaborate on the above points explain what you exactly mean.

d) You then state:

"However, I made a search with your name and read a few passages of your articles and gave up on that illusion very soon. I am afraid your heart is filled with Islamic hate and you have no regards for truth, fairness, love and mankind."

It is difficult fathom why you want to engage in a debate with me and yet you confess that you do not want read my views as you say "read few passages of your articles and gave up" ! It appears to me that you have made up your mind even before engaging in the debate. Is that how you intend to debate? Please clarify this important point. Furthermore, you pass judgments ( "Islamic hate", "truth", "love", "twisted sense of morality" ) on me without elaborating on what those terms mean by referring to my articles but of course you cannot because you have not read them! Is this not a clear evidence of blind-fanaticism of the type espoused by the likes of Hitler?

You claim my "twisted sense of morality" with no examples or elaboration but then why don't you state and define your so-called "morality". There is no need to be shy! We want to get a glimpse of the religion according to Prophet (or read as Profit) Ali Sina after we leave Islam. So, please elaborate on your morality and we will be looking forward to seeing this.

But wait - According to your earlier stated criteria, truth, hate morality are all subjective as you said let people decide freely! So now what ABSOLUTE 'morals' are you HYPOCRITCALLY trying to lecture me with? This all sounds like a position of someone talking from a position of "belief and irrationality" standing on "very shaky ground of faith and conjecture" .

e) You then go on to make a lot of allegations using terms like "evil", "humanity", "savagery", "rape", "innocent", "murder" etc without defining and elaborating them, and the basis from which those are derived. You also say:

"Each one of us is free to make any assumption that he pleases but he must be able to prove that assumption or withdraw it. I think this is fair."

Charges are normally brought against someone in a court of law where the criteria of determining crime and punnishemnt already exist and are agreed upon. However in a debate across different ideologies we need to agree on the criteria and the definitions of the terms before we can determine the respective allegations. Otherwise they are mere "assumptions" or "accusations" herald from a premise not recognised by the other and vice versa. Hence, by rational necessity this is a prerequisite before you can establish the truth of your allegation. To illustrate the point here are two examples which you yourself touched upon.

We consider those who engage in beheading en masse by the use of Napalm, B52s and Cluster bombs etc are the real "subhumans". Those US soldiers in Abu-Ghraib, Fallujah and elsewhere "engaging in senseless acts of terror" behaving like real "monsters, beasts and vampires" . As for the Iraqis they are merely the heroic resistance fighters defending their lands by whatever means they have at their disposal. Let us not forget the US is in Iraq not the reverse. So you see we are at odds as to what is meant by the term "subhuman" and the other terms, and how they are applied. Similarly, we can call someone a "murderer" but according which laws is he or she has committed the crime?

Another example we consider Homosexuality, Adultery, Rape, Bestiality, Sadism, Incest, Necrophilia, Snuff Sex, and many other deviant forms of sexual practices as understood from Islamic texts are crimes punishable in Islam. But these practices seem perfectly acceptable to many of the freethinkers around us, and in accordance to your criteria of letting people decide freely. Similarly you may levy certain charges against me using your definitions of certain terms. Hence we must agree on the criteria, definitions then we can proceed to evaluate your allegations.

Mr Sina, as I stated earlier this is not going to be a debate about Islam or nothing but Islam and the alternative as you said you have a "better alternative" . By rational necessity this has to be the case as issuing criticism by definition means there are criteria for making that judgement. It seems you (Mr. Sina) simply want to sit and levy charges against Islam without elaborating your "better alternative" in fear of exposing yourself. So that others can put your "better alternative" to the docks as much you are doing to Islam. Avoiding this tantamount to intellectual defeat, like the man who wears a mask and calls everyone else ugly but his so-called "better alternative" is kept hidden under the mask because it is in reality very grotesque. Hence, this is important for our viewers to see objectively both sides of the arguments, so that they may know what "better alternative" that they are getting into after leaving ISLAM.

Of course when we get to the actual debate after you clarified these above points, it would be constructive you and others to keep to one of subject at a time rather than go off at a tangent on many other issues. I see that in your enthusiasm you have touched a lot of subjects no doubt you will get an opportunity so please be patient.

You need not worry about telling me about publishing my response, as not only I have a website but huge email database and my articles regularly appear on many websites and newspapers. Issuing such petty threats like a school boy does not bother me so do not waste your time going down that venue. If you do not publish my response the readers will "interpret this as your lack of confident in your ability to win this debate" .

A Debate between YAMIN ZAKARIA and ALI SINA
Published: February 27, 200 5

Ali Sina Responds to Part - 1

$50,000 Debate - Here is my response to Mr. Ali Sina

Please note where I have used bold and italics inside quotes to highlight Mr. Sina's quotations in his previous response.

a) You (Ali Sina) say that I must take your word as being the judicator as well as the opponent, oh really! This is surely a laughable and a farcical position, it is like saying one of boxers in the ring should also be the referee. Then expect the other boxer to take his word when the final scoring is done! Is this how you understand objectivity and fair play? Or is this coming from your "logical gun" ?

It also demonstrates arrogance on your part thinking that you can be Judge, Jury and Executioner all at the same time. Perhaps this is our first glimpse into your "position of logics and truth" that you so proudly boast about!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

To Mr. Zakaria, the referee is the public. I do not expect you to accept your loss even though I would admit if I am wrong. Now are you going to defend Muhammad of the charges that I made against him or are you going to weasel your way out of the debate with these excuses. Remember I did not invite you to debate, you responded to my general invitation and these are the conditions. Take it or leave it. I am not going to waste my time and the time of my readers discussing about silly things. I want to debate about Muhammad and prove the world he is indefensible. If you are not up to the challenge, please clear the way and let a real contender respond.

Furthermore, I do not have disciples. We are freethinkers. I know this is a difficult concept for you to grasp but let me tell you that even my cat is a freethinker. He has a mind of his own and does not pay any attention to what I say. That is why I like him. He is a freethinking cat. The followers of Muhammad who blindly obey what he told them and have submitted their intelligence to him cannot understand this and do not have a cat's independence of thought. They pride themselves in their submission and slavery.

What I proposed was FAIR - We appoint or agree on judicator(s) and I would like to further propose that we have a binding contract through our solicitors who will hold the money into a neutral account. We should limit the number of exchanges then the judicators should pronounce the verdict. In the UK we have a saying "put your money where your mouth is". Please clarify this important point.

You are filibustering Mr. Zakaria. First try to debate. If you sense you are getting any close to winning then you can start talking about the money. Suppose I lie and there is no money. Won't you like to clear your prophet from these charges? Isn't defending Islam enough incentive for you? I am not going to waste my time discussing on this matter.

The more we talk about the form the less we can talk about the substance and this is not my idea of debate. This is my offer. Take it of leave it. Without the offer, Muslims don't debate, now with the offer they want to talk about the money. How can I get you people talk about your prophet and defend him from the charges I have laid on him?

b) You say the following with respect to providing mankind an alternative to Islam:

"Yes, I do have a better alternative to Islam but I am not here to tell people what path they should choose. I leave that to them to decide."

You have a mysterious alternative but you do not elaborate on this at all although this is exactly what I asked for in my first email. This is Deja vou for me. In any case, from the above one line 'elaboration' your alternative seems to be rather contradictory. What if the people decided to choose the path of ISLAM by your criterion of letting people decide freely? Then by your 'logic' your opposition is not to the ideas of ISLAM as long as they have exercised their free choice in selecting that path. But, then you contradict yourself when you later deny that right of free choice as you say: "nor would I accept your right to believe in it" i.e. Islam. You sound a like a confused person standing on "very shaky ground of faith and conjecture"

How can you say: " I am not here to tell the people what path they should choose. I leave that to them to decide" and then you contradict yourself by dictating that they should not choose the path of ISLAM as you later say "nor would I accept your right to believe in it" ? This indicates that you are confused on the fundamental basis of your argument.

I already clarified this point. I said people must be free to believe in any fairytale they like. However if their fairytale tells them they should kill othres, then that fairytale must be stopped. I do not have the right to believe that by killing you I go to heaven and neither you have such right.

Recently a young lady friend of ours in Belgium was threatened and the police captured the assassin before he could carry out his evil design. When questioned, he said, I am a sinner but I wand Allah to forgive my sins and send me to heaven. The best way to do that is to kill an apostate. The Belgian police thought he is mentally disturbed. But you and I know that is not true. He is a believer of the lies of Muhammad and he had accomplices. The victim is even frightened to write about her story. This is not the kind of belief free people should tolerate.

So far Islam has advanced by camouflaging itself as a religion. This must change. People will gradually learn the truth and realize Islam is a dangerous cult that aims to subdue them and subvert their form of life. Then Muslims will be seen as the enemy and they will lose their right to promote and propagate their cult of terror.

Do the Nazis have the right to have their party and promote their cause? I don't know of any democratic country that allows such thing. Most democratic systems ban racist and fascist movements. Islam is a fascistic ideology. It must be banned.

Banning Islam is not in contradiction with democracy and freedom of thought. Democracies have been earned through sacrifices and blood. Those who believe in democracy should also protect it. Democracy does not mean dictatorship of the majority. It does not mean letting fascism come to power democratically to behead that democracy. Hitler and Khomeini came to power through popular vote. But they did not bring democracy. They strangulated it.

I want to unmask Islam and let the world see Islam is worse than Nazism. It must be stopped. This is not against democracy. This is protecting the democracy. Democracy has some rules. One rule of democracy is respect of the rights of the minority. We can't let an undemocratic ideology or a party come to power, using our democratic process, when it does not believe in the rights of the minority. That is why Islam must be stopped.

Furthermore, when invoking criticism by rational necessity you must have what is right in your mind to criticise with in the first place. Otherwise you are like a masked man that calls everyone else ugly!

HENCE PLEASE NOTE: We do need a comprehensive elaboration on your alternative to pursue a serious debate as we can only get meaningful discussion when you know what each side stands for - this is particularly vital for the audience.

And it seems you fear to provide alternative as you will end up contradicting yourself just like I have already demonstrated, as it is self-evident from your statements.

You seem to pay little attention to what others say. I already said I accuse Islam because it is contrary to the Golden Rule. The Golden Rule is my yardstick. Islam is diametrically opposed to the Golden Rule and hence a threat to mankind. This is my standard for criticizing Islam. Is that not clear enough? I oppose Islam for the same reasons I oppose Nazism or fascism. These ideologies are ideologies of hate and they are contrary to the Golden Rule. I do not have to tell people what ideologies are best for them. As long as their belief system does not violate the Golden Rule and as long as they respect my freedom of belief, they should be free to believe in whatever they wish.

c) You then go on to say "Almost anything is better than Islam". So surely you must have a set of values to judge Islam by otherwise it is empty rhetoric typical of a bigot, blinded by hate. To classify something as evil or good you need define and elaborate your criteria of assessing good and evil . Something is not evil simply because you say so!

You refer to the crimes of the Second World War. By your criterion of letting people to choose freely, there should be no objection if they chose the likes of Hitler again! So what exactly are you espousing Mr Sina? Again does this not show you are indeed a confused man or a woman? Or is that your position on "logic and truth" ! Please elaborate on the above points explain what you exactly mean.

No, something is not good or evil simply because I say it or because Muhammad says it. Good and evil must be measured according to a defined criterion. My criterion is the Golden Rule. This is a self evident criterion. It works like an inner compass for all human beings who are endowed with commonsense. In Islam this criterion is rejected. Good and bad are not manifest on their own. They are established by what Muhammad ordered and prohibited. What he ordered or prohibited could be contrary to the Golden Rule. But his words are the standard. Muslims have no regards for the Golden Rule.

The Golden Rule says do to others what you would expect others do to you. This is very simple and easy to understand and apply. I do not like to be cheated, so I must not cheat others. I do not like to be killed, so I must not kill others. I do not want anyone rape my wife, so I must not rape others. This principle works like a Swiss clock. It never fails. You can find all the guidance you need by this compass.

But the Golden Rule has no place in Islam. Muhammad told his followers to fight the unbelievers and impose on them his religion. How do you like the Jews, the Christians or the Hindus fight the Muslims and impose their religion on them? Muhammad raided civilian towns, killed unarmed men, looted their belongings and enslaved and raped their wives. How do you like this to be done to you and your family?

Let me quote some of the verses of the Quran switching the words "Muslims" and "non-Muslims". Let us see how they sound.

8:12 We will cast terror into the hearts of Muslims. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.

3:28 , Let not the non-Muslims take for friends or helpers the Muslims.

8:65 , Rouse the non-Muslims to the fight against Muslims.

9:5 , Then fight and slay the Muslims wherever ye find them,

9:14 , Fight the Muslims, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame.

9:23 , O ye the non-Muslims take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love Islam.

9:28 , O ye the non-Muslims! Truly the Muslims are unclean.

9:123 , O ye non-Muslims! fight the Muslims who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you.

47:4 , Therefore, when ye meet the Muslims, smite at their necks; At length.

How do you like them? I bet you don't like them.

That is why Islam is contrary to the Golden Rule. That is why Islam is dangerous and evil in its core. That is why we must strive and eradicate this ideology of hate to assure mankind is safe and human lives are not sacrificed. So as you see there is no contradiction between promoting democracy and freedom of thought and eradicating Islam, Nazism, fascism or any other hatemongering and divisive ideology.

d) You then state:
"However, I made a search with your name and read a few passages of your articles and gave up on that illusion very soon. I am afraid your heart is filled with Islamic hate and you have no regards for truth, fairness, love and mankind."

It is difficult fathom why you want to engage in a debate with me and yet you confess that you do not want read my views as you say "read few passages of your articles and gave up" ! It appears to me that you have made up your mind even before engaging in the debate. Is that how you intend to debate? Please clarify this important point. Furthermore, you pass judgments ( "Islamic hate", "truth", "love", "twisted sense of morality" ) on me without elaborating on what those terms mean by referring to my articles but of course you cannot because you have not read them! Is this not a clear evidence of blind-fanaticism of the type espoused by the likes of Hitler?

Mr. Zakaria, let me remind you again that it is you who approached me and declared your readiness to debate with me. So your question, "why you want to engage in debate with me", is moot. As for reading your articles, I read enough to see where you come from and what you say. Whether you like it or not you belong to a very well defined pigeonhole. Sure we will discuss all your views and I will show why I believe you have a very twisted sense of morality. One example of that is in the above verses. You have no problem reading those verses as they appear in the Quran and you would defend them. But certainly you feel very much uncomfortable if the places of Muslims and non-Muslims are switched. But there are more examples that I found in your articles.

You claim my "twisted sense of morality" with no examples or elaboration but then why don't you state and define your so-called "morality". There is no need to be shy! We want to get a glimpse of the religion according to Prophet (or read as Profit) Ali Sina after we leave Islam. So, please elaborate on your morality and we will be looking forward to seeing this.

But wait - According to your earlier stated criteria, truth, hate morality are all subjective as you said let people decide freely! So now what ABSOLUTE 'morals' are you HYPOCRITCALLY trying to lecture me with? This all sounds like a position of someone talking from a position of "belief and irrationality" standing on "very shaky ground of faith and conjecture" .

I think I already defined what morality is. It is the application of the the Golden Rule. But morality is not relative at all. The Golden Rule is absolute and so the morality derived from it. It is Islam that teaches moral relativism. Rape is bad but rape of the disbelievers is good. Murder is bad but Murder of kafirs is divine. Child molestation is bad but if Muhammad lusts after a 9-year-old child that is good. If a non-Muslim kills a Muslim he should be put to death but no Muslim should be killed for killing a non-Muslim. A married man may lust after other woman and marry four wives but this rule does not apply to women. Islam is a moral relativistic doctrine.

e) You then go on to make a lot of allegations using terms like "evil", "humanity", "savagery", "rape", "innocent", "murder" etc without defining and elaborating them, and the basis from which those are derived. You also say:
"Each one of us is free to make any assumption that he pleases but he must be able to prove that assumption or withdraw it. I think this is fair."
We are just beginning this debate. I will withdraw any charge that I can't prove. But of course I can't prove all of them at once in an introductory message. That was just to let you know the kind of accusations I am going to make against your prophet. We shall go through them one by one and then I will present my proofs and you'll have the opportunity to refute them.

Charges are normally brought against someone in a court of law where the criteria of determining crime and punishment already exist and are agreed upon. However in a debate across different ideologies we need to agree on the criteria and the definitions of the terms before we can determine the respective allegations. Otherwise they are mere "assumptions" or "accusations" herald from a premise not recognised by the other and vice versa. Hence, by rational necessity this is a prerequisite before you can establish the truth of your allegation. To illustrate the point here are two examples which you yourself touched upon.

We consider those who engage in beheading en masse by the use of Napalm, B52s and Cluster bombs etc are the real "subhumans". Those US soldiers in Abu-Ghraib, Fallujah and elsewhere "engaging in senseless acts of terror" behaving like real "monsters, beasts and vampires" . As for the Iraqis they are merely the heroic resistance fighters defending their lands by whatever means they have at their disposal. Let us not forget the US is in Iraq not the reverse. So you see we are at odds as to what is meant by the term "subhuman" and the other terms, and how they are applied. Similarly, we can call someone a "murderer" but according to which laws he or she has committed the crime?

You have confused and bungled up a lot of issues. Let us dissect and clarify them. What happened in Abu Ghraib was a crime according to the US military law. The perpetrators broke the law. They were prosecuted and found guilty and were put behind the bars. Some of them received sentences as long as 15 years. We certainly can't condemn America , its people or its government and not even its military if a few of its individuals break the law. Criminals and law breakers exist in every society. If they are prosecuted and punished the society can't be blamed.

Before responding to the rest of the charges let me make a comparison to what these prison guards (now convicts) did and what Muhammad did. The following is an extract from the abbreviation of Sira

"Kinana, the husband of Safiya, had been guardian of the tribe's treasures, and he was brought before the apostle, who asked where they were hidden. But Kinana refused to disclose the place. Then a Jew came who said, 'I have seen Kinana walk around a certain ruin every morning.' The apostle asked Kinana, 'Art thou prepared to die if we find thou knewest where the treasure was?' And he replied, 'Yes.' So the apostle ordered the ruin to be dug up, and some of the treasure was found. After that Kinana was asked again about the remainder, but he still refused to tell. The apostle of Allah handed him over to al-Zubayr, saying, 'Torture him until he tells what he knows', and al-Zubayr kindled a fire on his chest so that he almost expired; then the apostle gave him to Muhammad b. Maslama, who struck off his head."

The American guards who broke the law are prosecuted and are now serving their prison terms. But they did not kill their prisoners and the torture was mere humiliation and light compared to what Muhammad did to Kinana. However, you worship Muhammad and think he was a perfect example to emulate. Can you explain this moral relativism?

Now let us talk about the rest of your accusations. You accuse the Americans and the British soldiers and their respective governments of criminal activity for what they do in Iraq. Who are you to say that? 72% of the Iraqis defied all the threats from your terrorist brothers and went to the polls to show they want to take charge of their lives and they are not going to be intimidated by the terrorists. The turn out would have been much more in some cities where people stood by and did not dare to vote fearing the terrorists would do good on their promise and would behead them and their children. So obviously the Iraqis are happy with the presence of the coalition forces in their country and they hate the terrorists who routinely round up truck drivers, health care workers, police officers and ordinary people, shoot them or behead them and try to win through creating fear among the people.

The coalition forces, i.e. the kafirs, are trying to bring democracy and self rule to the oppressed people of Iraq . Their Muslim "brothers" are trying to take away that freedom through terror and planned killings.

The coalition forces never have targeted innocent people. Innocent people have sadly died despite the extra care in the crossfire. This is not act of terrorism. This is unfortunate collateral causality.

A doctor may operate on a patient and the patient may die in the process. This is not murder. The intent matters. The intent has not been to murder but to save life. Muslims murder their victims intentionally. They deliberately target innocent civilians, bomb them and shoot to kill them. The victims of 9/11 in WTC, 3/11 in Madrid , the innocent children in Beslan, the victims of Bali , Riadh, Synagogues in Turkey, Churches in Iraq, the Israelis killed by suicide bombers, are deliberately targeted and blown up by a malicious design. There is a huge difference between these two killings. Americans never target the civilians, never kill non-combatants. If an American soldier shoots a wounded enemy, he is charged and prosecuted. So your characterization of the Americans and the coalition soldiers is false. They are not engaged in senseless acts of terror and they are not monsters, beasts and vampires. They are soldiers who are fighting a just war. They want to liberate an oppressed people who are grateful for being liberated. I am an Iranian and I would welcome these soldiers to invade my country and liberate my people. I can't ask that because it is unfair that these young men and women die to free my people but if they do it I would be grateful to them for ever.

Americans and other coalition forces are not in Iraq to steal the oil and the wealth of the people. The American people are paying huge amounts of money to the Iraqis to rebuild their country. Many of these kafir nations have forgiven their loans to Iraq. They want to see Iraqis are freed, prosperous and happy. It is unconscionable to call these armies of liberation, terrorists, monsters and vampires. If they are so bad why the Iraqis don't want them to leave? Because they know who are the terrorists, monsters and vampires. Those are your religious brothers. Those who cowardly take the people, behead or shoot them and shout Allah-u' Akbar.

If a bunch of gangsters take my family as hostage and I ask a neighbor for help and if during this shootout my son is killed, I can't accuse my neighbor of murder. He did not intend to kill my son. It was an accident. But the thugs inside who have taken my family as hostage and behead them one after the other until their demands are met are the terrorists. Only a fool is unable to see the difference.

Now let us compare the actions of Americans in Iraq with what Muhammad did to his victims. Muhammad raided his victims with no warning. He took them by surprise. When they had gone out after their daily business and were not ready for combat. He rode among them in full military gear and butchered as many men as he could. Then he took their children and wives as slaves and took possession of their properties. He even allowed his men to rape the women thus captured and he himself always took the prettiest for himself. Juwairiayah, Rayhana and Safia are three women thus captured and raped. Muhammad built his immense wealth by killing and looting.

When I said you have a twisted sense of morality, it was because I read this very nonsense statement of yours about the Americans in one of your articles and here is the proof of what I said about you.

Another example we consider Homosexuality, Adultery, Rape, Bestiality, Sadism, Incest, Necrophilia, Snuff Sex, and many other deviant forms of sexual practices a s understood from Islamic texts are crimes punishable in Islam. But these practices seem perfectly acceptable to many of the freethinkers around us, and in accordance to your criteria of letting people decide freely. Similarly you may levy certain charges against me using your definitions of certain terms. Hence we must agree on the criteria, definitions then we can proceed to evaluate your allegations.

Again you have mixed and bundled up a lot of things that are different in nature.

Homosexuality is not a crime. There are a couple of elderly Lesbians leaving next door to me. I have not seen anything indecent or inhuman in them. If they sleep in the same bed or they don't does in no ways affect me. It is not even my business to ask whether they share the same bedroom or have separate bedrooms. They are working like anyone else and contribute to the society like others. They have not hurt me. Why should they be killed? What is more immoral? That they are homosexual or that you are a murderer? This is another example of your twisted sense of morality. You see homosexuality as immorality but you don't see anything wrong in killing people.

I am not an authority on this subject. But I know that at least a good portion of homosexuals are physically and emotionally not "normal'. They are different. If you believe God creates people, then God made them this way. What right you have to tell God he has made a mistake in creating the homosexuals the way he has? What right you have to take away the lives of those whom are the handiwork of God? As long as they don't harm other, what food they eat, what movies they watch or with whom they sleep should not be anyone's business but their own. If they are doing something wrong, you are not God, let God deal with them the way he knows best.

Adultery : In Islam this falls under two classes: The premarital sex and the out of marriage sex. As for premarital sex, it is none of your damn business. You can teach your morals to your daughter and son but you have no right to impose your morality on others. As for adultery of married people, it is something that should concern the husband and the wife and again it is none of your damn business. You make sure you do not commit adultery like the majority of Muslim men and watch your wife. You have no business to put your nose in the private lives of others. If I marry someone who commits adultery, I will divorce her but it is not up to state or you to stone her. This is why I say you have a very twisted sense of morality. You see adultery as something abhorrent when it is none of your business but see nothing wrong in stoning a person to death.

Then again you believe in polygamy. This is licensing adultery. You can have sex with as many women as you like, all you have to do is declare them your wives and divorce them at whim. That is a mockery of marriage. Muhammad allowed muta or temporary marriages. Umar banned it but the Shiites still practice it. This is nothing but legalized prostitution.

Rape: Rape is a crime in civilized countries and there is zero tolerance for that. The rapists are brought to justice and if they present a permanent danger they are often locked up for good. But incidentally rape is not so bad in Islamic countries. First of all a husband can rape his wife anytime and this is not considered rape at all. But that is not what concerns me most. What is essentially evil in Islam is that rape is prescribed in the Quran and was practiced and encouraged by Muhammad himself. Muhammad told his followers it is okay to rape women captured in war even if they are married before being captured, 4:24 This is a long subject and I will come to that later and will dedicate an entire chapter to it. However suffice to say that your twisted sense of morality did not allow you to see that rape is something the civilized world does not tolerate while it is part of Islam. I am afraid you put your foot in your mouth when you casually included "rape" to the list of your diatribe against the West.

Bestiality: This sickness is in no ways exclusive to the westerners. We have Rumi talking about a maid and her lady having sex with a donkey and there are injunctions by Muslim jurists regulating the sex with animals. Khomeini talked about this extensively. In fact, because the relationship between men and women in Islam is taboo, bestiality is far more practiced in Islamic countries than in non-Muslim world. Sex with animals among the non-Muslims is an aberration while among the Muslims is not that unusual. So when you accuse the westerners of bestiality, you are a pot calling the kettle black. You see the thorn in the eyes of others but can't see the beam in your own.

Sadism: This is not a cultural disease but a psychological one. Sadists are psychopaths. They are often victims of childhood abuse. But childhood abuse happen more in Islamic countries where people are allowed to beat their children and domestic violence is unchecked. Children thus neglected or grown up in abusive environments become sadists. Sadists abound in Islamic countries. How many Saddams, Khomeinies, Al Zarqawi or Bin Ladens can you find in Western countries?

But that is not all. Muhammad himself was a sadist and used to torture his victims. We already talked about Kinana, let us quote a hadith to learn more about Muhammad's sadism.
Bukhari 7, 71.589

"Some people were sick and they said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give us shelter and food. So when they became healthy they said, "The weather of Medina is not suitable for us." So he sent them to Al-Harra with some she-camels of his and said, "Drink of their milk." But when they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away his camels. The Prophet sent some people in their pursuit. Then he got their hands and feet cut and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. I saw one of them licking the earth with his tongue till he died ."

But that is not all. Your Allah is also a sadist. Take a look:

4.56 Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.
Isn't this sadism?

Again you put your foot in your mouth when you throw in sadism. Islam is sadism. It is a cult created by a sadist psychopath.

Incest: This is a sickness of mind. It is by no means an exclusively western problem. In fact incest is much more a problem in Islamic counties than it is in the West. Because the relationship of men and women is taboo and because boys see only their sisters unveiled and accessible, the incest among brothers and sisters and uncle and niece happen a lot more in Islamic countries where the women can be even raped by their family members. This problem rarely surface, unless the sister becomes pregnant and if that happen she is killed to save the "honor" of the family.

Necrophilia: This is a mental disease and it has nothing to do with race or culture. There are sick people everywhere and I am sure Muslims who are sick in many other ways thanks to their sick religion are no better when it comes to this insanity. Do you have any proof that necrophilia does not happen in Islamic countries?
Talking about Necrophilia there is a curious hadith that I would like to share.

This is from a book called "Kanz Al Umal" ( The Treasure of the Workers ), in the chapter of "The issues of women", authored by Ali Ibn Husam Aldin, commonly known as Al-Mutaki Al-Hindi. He based his book on the hadiths and sayings listed in "Al-Jami Al-Saghir," written by Jalal ul-Din Al-Suyuti.
Narrated by Ibn Abbas:

'I (Muhammad) put on her my shirt that she may wear the clothes of heaven, and I SLEPT with her in her coffin (grave) that I may lessen the pressure of the grave. She was the best of Allah's creatures to me after Abu Talib'. The prophet was referring to Fatima , the mother of Ali. (Sentence number 34424 http://www.al-eman.com/Islamlib/viewchp.asp?BID=137&amp;CID=426#s2 )
Demetrius Explains : "The Arabic word used here for slept is "Id'tajat," and literally means "lay down" with her. It is often used to mean, "Lay down to have sex." Muhammad is understood as saying that because he slept with her she has become like a wife to him so she will be considered like a "mother of the believers." This will supposedly prevent her from being tormented in the grave, since Muslims believe that as people wait for the Judgment Day they will be tormented in the grave. "Reduce the pressure" here means that the torment won't be as much because she is now a "mother of the believers" after Muhammad slept with her and "consummated" the union. "

The above explanation may not be necessarily correct. I personally think Muhammad simply laid down with the cadaver. There is no doubt that Muhammad was sick in the head but I doubt he was that sick. Anyway, I just quoted the haidith as I found it relevant but my hunch says Demetrius is wrong.

http://www.al-eman.com/Islamlib/viewchp.asp?BID=137&amp;CID=426

Snuff Sex: I have no idea what is this. It is the first time I hear such word. Can you please explain to us how it is done and why you think the westerners do it more than Muslims? Bring your proof.

So as you see your accusations are completely baseless. Some of these insanities are practiced more among the Muslims and some of them are even encouraged by Islam.

Pedophilia: You either forgot or intentionally did not talk about this mental disease. This happens also in the West and the tolerance of the Westerners towards it is inexistence. The pedophiles are hunted down and locked up to protect the children. However you conveniently did not mention it because pedophilia is not a crime in Islamic world at all. Many men have pedophilic relations with young boys and marrying children is also a sunnah. In fact pedophilia in Islam is so normal that Muhammad in his sick way of thinking promised "pearly boys" to his faithful followers. The thought of that is sickening but the fact that Muhammad makes it part of the heavenly rewards shows he thought is it something pleasurable.

52:24 Round about them will serve, (devoted) to them. Youths (handsome) as pearls well-guarded.

Mr Sina, as I stated earlier this is not going to be a debate about Islam or nothing but Islam and the alternative as you said you have a "better alternative" . By rational necessity this has to be the case as issuing criticism by definition means there are criteria for making that judgement. It seems you (Mr. Sina) simply want to sit and levy charges against Islam without elaborating your "better alternative" in fear of exposing yourself. So that others can put your "better alternative" to the docks as much you are doing to Islam. Avoiding this tantamount to intellectual defeat, like the man who wears a mask and calls everyone else ugly but his so-called "better alternative" is kept hidden under the mask because it is in reality very grotesque. Hence, this is important for our viewers to see objectively both sides of the arguments, so that they may know what "better alternative" that they are getting into after leaving ISLAM.

I already said what my alternative is. I am a humanist and a practitioner of the Golden Rule . This is my alternative. But because I believe in the Golden Rule and the freedom of faith, I respect people's choice to believe in any religion they like. I do not agree with the premises of any of these religions; however I have no right to stop people believing in them. My fight is not against faith , it is against hate . The reason I am against Islam is not because it is a religion but because it is a political movement of imperialism and domination in the guise of religion.

I know why you insist so much that I tell you what religion I practice when I practice none. You can't defend Islam. You are only trained to engage in tu quoque or the "you too" fallacy and attack other religions instead of defending Islam. With me you feel helpless. You are completely disarmed. The circuits in your brain are short circled. You just don't know what to do next.
Here is where the weakness of Islam is exposed. All you Muslims can do is to counter attack and start finding fault with the religion of your opponent. And since you can't do that with me, you simply are lost.

Let me explain this to you Mr. Zskaria. I have no religion. I do not believe in anything. I am a freethinker. I doubt, investigate and come to the truth by weighing the facts. My motto, is doubt everything, find your own light. It is not that I see all religions as totally wrong. I see truth and beauty in all the religions in various degrees. The only religion that is bereft of truth and beauty is Islam. I cherry pick the good things in all the religions and philosophies. I think all religions are manmade. But this does not mean they are bad. Some parts of them are very good. Although I do not think they are divine guidance, I think one can find pearls of wisdom in many of them. The only religion that is pure dung and has no pearls is Islam. Other religions are manmade while Islam is made be a psychopath. This is the big difference.

Of course when we get to the actual debate after you clarified these above points, it would be constructive for you and others to keep to one subject at a time rather than go off at a tangent on many other issues. I see that in your enthusiasm you have touched a lot of subjects no doubt you will get an opportunity so please be patient.

I think we agree on that.

You need not worry about telling me about publishing my response, as not only I have a website but huge email database and my articles regularly appear on many websites and newspapers. Issuing such petty threats like a school boy does not bother me so do not waste your time going down that venue. If you do not publish my response the readers will "interpret this as your lack of confident in your ability to win this debate" .

Yamin Zakaria's Responds to Mr. Ali Sina in Part-II

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The "Golden Rule" Cult of Ali Sina
I accepted Mr Sina's offer to debate with him and asked him to clarify the terms of his offer: the practical mechanism in place for determining the winner and verifying the availability of the prize money ($50,000). It is sensible and the norm to clarify the terms of the contract prior to engagement. So, I am perplexed and the readers will surely judge as to why the clarification process can amount to "silly things" or "excuses" or "filibustering"! The only "weasel" like behaviour that I can see is Mr Sina trying to evade this issue!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

What was really silly is Mr Sina's incompetence to recognise that two opponents cannot be expected unilaterally to: declare victory or admit defeat, especially when there is a large some of money is at stake. Commonsense dictates that impartial (not the 'publics' visiting Mr Sina's forum) judicators are required to asses the debate and issue the verdict. Any genuine freethinker even with a miniature "logical gun" would have recognised this simple fact! Time would be far less wasted if Mr Sina admitted that he had lied about the money. We can continue with the debate without arguing about side issues. I have no problem with debating regardless of the money which I would have most probably donated to the various causes.

Before getting to the actual substance of the debate I would like to answer couple of points that Mr Sina cited in his previous response. First of all, had Mr Sina exercised his freethinking 'capability' he might have realised that I used the word "disciple" to denote sarcasm, hence it was stated within single quotes. Instead, he should have let his cat answer that point as it might have had a better chance in spotting the sarcasm! Secondly, as followers of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) we use our intelligence correctly to verify His Prophethood and the existence of the creator as opposed to have blind faith in a man who proclaims that he has the truth wrapped up in his so-called "Golden-Rule"! Consequently, we submit to our creator in obedience that is the most intelligent and consistent thing to do. But that is another separate discussion.

Now, lets move on to the real issue of the debate. Mr Sina said that he will be making the allegations against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) on the basis that the Prophet (SAW) has violated the "Golden Rule". As he says Islam contradicts the "Golden Rule"; the rule is his "criterion" and "yard stick". Therefore, Mr Sina has to prove the legitimacy of the "Golden Rule" otherwise it is a mere assumption. In the absence of proof, Mr Sina would be violating his first rule which he stated earlier: "he must be able to prove that assumption or withdraw it"!

Allegations are normally brought against someone in a court of law where the criterion of determining the crime is already enforced. But this is not a court of law and Mr Sina should stop assuming in his arrogance that he is in one in the guise of judge, jury and executioner; as he constantly demands that Muslims should come forward to defend the Prophet (SAW) as if the Prophet has already been proven to be guilty by Mr Sina's constant rants.

We are in fact debating from two different premises with different sets of criteria. Therefore, unless we agree on some common criterion for assessing the allegations of Mr Sina we will only trade accusations and counter accusations as neither of us recognises each others premises, criteria and values.

Mr Sina is the one bringing forward the allegations on the basis of his criterion of the "Golden Rule". Therefore, the onus is on him to prove that rule as absolute authority by substantiating that it is: comprehensive, self-evident and universal. Once consensus is reached on the "Golden Rule" it will naturally function as a common criterion. Then we can logically proceed to asses the allegations brought forward using the rule as a "Yard Stick". This is the heart of the debate. Therefore, I have addressed the "Golden Rule" first followed by the other points in the previous response of Mr Sina.

Mr Sina's "Golden Rule"

First of all, Mr Sina only mentioned the "Golden Rule" abruptly in his first response. Almost halfway into his second response he defined and elaborated it with examples. So, Mr Sina needs to pay attention to what he writes and when he writes and he says:

"The Golden Rule says do to others what you would expect others do to you. This is very simple and easy to understand and apply. I do not like to be cheated, so I must not cheat others. I do not like to be killed, so I must not kill others. I do not want anyone rape my wife, so I must not rape others. This principle works like a Swiss clock. It never fails. You can find all the guidance you need by this compass."

The points below will rationally and factually prove: the so-called "Golden Rule" is not self-evident, not universal, and inadequate to provide comprehensive guidance; - but also Mr Sina actually contradicts this notion. I hope Mr Sina this time pays attention to the actual principle presented instead of going into a tangent by disputing the examples cited, a classic method of filibustering!

A) Contradictions - Mr Sina also claimed that: "Golden Rule is absolute and so the morality derived from". Yet, his definition of the "Golden Rule" rule clearly states that it is the prerogative of the individuals to interpret the meaning and the scope of the rule as it says "what you would expect" or what you "do not like". Taking his example of cheating, a trader may think that it is lawful to inflate the image of his goods but the consumer may feel cheated. Hence, the rule is not only subjective but also inadequate and Mr Sina has contradicted himself clearly on this point! Mr Sina, my foot is not in my mouth but firmly embedded in your one track abusive and arrogant foul mouth!

To claim that democratic societies have fixed morality shows the lack of basic knowledge as democratic societies themselves would dispute that! The process of legislation is there catering for changes in morality. We witness everyday certain morals demolished replaced with new ones, homosexuality was once a sin but today it is fashionable. 'Living in sin' was a sin at one time but today it is the norm, and so on. Then Mr Sina has the audacity to state that bestiality and incest are sickness, but why? Is there anything inherent in these acts to classify it as good or bad or right or wrong? Has he asked those people who practice such things? Or has Mr Sina determined that from the "Golden Rule", if so, how?

B) Self-Evident - If the "Golden Rule" was self-evident then it would be universal but nobody upholds this as a fundamental principle for dealing with all matters in life. Otherwise it would manifest as a fundamental yardstick in legal principles, embedded in the constitution etc. The mere fact that the meaning and scope of the "Golden Rule" is disputed it is evidence, that the rule is not universal and self-evident. Therefore, since the authority of the "Golden Rule" is moot, so are allegations of Mr Sina which is based on the rule.

C) Conflicts - The "Golden Rule" as defined and elaborated by Mr Sina is not universal as it makes no references as to how it can be used to resolve conflicts of interests e.g. China feels it has the right to occupy Tibet, Russia over Chechnya and Israel over Palestine etc. Lack of answers on such issues is a very serious deficiency in Mr Sina's "Golden Rule". Because the "Golden Rule" cannot arbitrate disputes by giving answers which would have been the baseline to judge the actions of the Prophet. Therefore, how did Mr Sina arrive at his allegations against the Prophet's conduct many of which pertained to resolving conflicts with the pagan Arabs? Undoubtedly, any impartial observer will see that Mr Sina's charges are based on blind hatred.

D) Retribution - How can the "Golden Rule" be used to determine retribution for the countless scenarios? Without this knowledge, the one seeking justice is likely to violate the "Golden Rule" in exceeding the limits of retribution. If the "Golden Rule" was absolute and universal the level of retribution would have been similar at least across nations (democracies) that epitomises it.

However, even within a single democracy there is great variance on the subject of retribution. Even on matters of life and death. For example, capital punishment is applied in some of the US states but not others. Since the rule is incapable of determining the level of retribution then Mr Sina is not in a position to levy charges against the final Prophet (SAW) or any one else engaged in seeking retribution. His yardstick has no measurement!

E) Rape, Paedophilia and Cannibalism - Taking Mr. Sina's own example of rape there are many who find raping and being raped a turn on. There are couples that are into swapping kids. We all witnessed the two consenting adults in Germany engaged in Cannibalism. These categories of people using the logic of Mr Sina's "Golden Rule" may well argue that since they have no problem if others do to them all those things (Rape, Paedophilia and Cannibalism); they are entitled to do the same to others. Especially, because as the "Golden Rule" is silent on the matter of consent. Hence, Mr Sina's "logical gun" is backfiring!

Similarly, Mr Sina talks about murder in absolute terms but what about the animals? Why the animals can be slaughtered en masse for food and used in animal experimentation, violating their "Golden Rule" or is the animal kingdom outside the jurisdiction of Mr Sina's "golden Rule". The vegetarian community and the animal rights campaigner might well argue this point.

There are many who subscribe to the Darwin's principle of: "the survival of the fittest". If nature is supposed to function in this way, why should this not be extended to human beings? In fact, the free-market model found in most democracies operates on this principle. Accordingly, some would argue as others have practiced in the past, the right of the stronger party to extinguish the weak and the disabled purifying the gene pool. Hence they apply their interpretation of the "Golden Rule" and go on to take out the weaker species or until they themselves get taken out by stronger party.

So, I have made my case based on Mr Sina's definitions and his principles with clear examples proving that the "Golden Rule" is not universal, not self-evident, inadequate and not absolute. But also Mr Sina himself is muddled on the issue! It is flawed as a fundamental principle. At best it is just a moral advice to individuals to exercise self-restraint. Therefore, the allegations against the final Prophet (SAW) cannot be levied as MR. Sina himself does not know the meaning of his own rule, its scope and therefore it is from being in a position authority to judge others.

In the absence of proof it also implies Mr Sina like other anti-Islamic zealots has blind faith in the "Golden Rule", "based on shaky grounds". Yes, for once I do agree with Mr Sina let us call a spade a spade. Mr Sina is the muddled 'Prophet' of the so-called "Golden Rule" who cannot even articulate the basic idea of his rule and later examples will provide corroborative evidence of his muddled mindset.

Mr. Sina will probably feel very uncomfortable if he has managed to follow up to this point with sincerity. Hence, let him now prove his so-called "Golden Rule" by addressing the above points. Otherwise he is also hypocritically breaking his own rule when he said earlier that: "he must be able to prove that assumption or withdraw it".

Mr Sina's Logical Gun

Mr Sina casually used terms like "rape", "paedophilia", "murder", "Hate" and other similar ideas in an abusive manner against the Prophet in his two previous responses and in his website. Yet, he is the one that cited his first rule demanding that none of us should make any assumptions without proof. So he has violated his own principle by using such terms without defining and proving it in the first place. The points below will show that he not argue consistently despite bragging about his "logical gun". Also, he proclaimed himself as a "menacing" debater by email, I am sure our readers have already seen his level of 'modesty'!

Mr Sina's references to the actions of individuals do not help to support his case because individuals can act in line or against, divine principles. However, we judge democracies by their actions because there is no holy book of democracy or the "Golden Rule" book that elaborates on right and wrong. If Muslims were to engage in "rape", "incest" etc as defined by Islam then that is precisely due to the non-adherence to Islam! We have to resort to the Islamic definitions as Mr Sina has not defined his terms and we have not agreed to accept his definitions as correct.

So let us take some of Mr Sina's examples. Paedophilia is considered to be sexual acts with a child but how is the line drawn between a child and an adult. He considers a nine year girl who has acquired mental capacity and puberty to be a child. But Mr Sina has no problem in accepting that a twelve year old girl in New Hampshire on the eve of her birthday is a child and next day magically transforms into an adult. This is clearly arbitrary. If Mr Sina is really opposed by pre-pubescent sex which was not the case with the Prophet's marriage then why does he remain silent like a mule on the Rabbinic laws that do permit non-Penetrative sex with pre-pubescent children. Mr Sina is simply selective as he is a hypocrite.

Despite the disparity in age (which is a matter of taste) between two individuals engaged in a normal heterosexual relationship is some how abhorrent but Mr Sina has no problems with homosexual relationships and other forms of deviancies in this age of sexual liberalism where all taboos are broken! It can be further argued heterosexual relationship at least conforms to nature as one procreates. So how did Mr Sina employ his "logical gun" to come to such conclusions? If Mr. Sina investigates further, even a cursory Google Search he will find vast majority of the paedophilia websites, the people running it and the clients and they are NOT from the Islamic world. Does he not see those same types of people raiding the beaches in Thailand and South East Asia for kids that trying to survive in poverty? What about within the US, the various organisations like NAMBLA trying to legitimise Paedophilia?

Mr Sina also claims Islam exhibits hate. But instead of just elaborating his claims and providing his definitions of hate, it is he that displays the hatred towards Islam and Muslims violating his "Golden Rule". From the tone, content and deliberate uses of certain pejorative terms he incites hatred. Mr Sina's website confirms that as it only contains anti-Islamic diatribe but nothing on his so-called "Golden Rule". Why not? Because he wears a mask and calls others ugly and he is afraid to show his face as it can be also put on the dock. Here it is pertinent for me to quote an Old Persian says "If you don't like what you see in the mirror break your face not the mirror". Mr Sina must feeling the cracks in his face now and in his words "lost", "completely disarmed" and "the circuits in his brain are short-circuited". This only proves that "freethinkers" are unable to pose intellectual argument and provide an alternative that is as comprehensive as Islam, hence all they do behind their masks is it try and provoke a fight 'below the belt' by constantly emitting profanity and obscenity like hoodlums!

Another example of the muddled mindset of Mr Sina is that he cannot distinguish between the status of War, declared between nations and actual military operation. He cites one of the raids of Prophet Muhammad as wanton aggression but the war was declared prior to that. Just like the US declared the war on Iraq but it did not give the Iraqis the battle plan telling them when and how they will conduct the raids.

I have decided to provide some entertainment by giving further examples illustrating that he is false and muddled Prophet of the cult of "Golden Rule". You will have some light entertainment, so please continue. I know it has been long.

On Islam and Religion - Here are a couple of quotes from Mr Sina:

a) "So far Islam has advanced by camouflaging itself as a religion."

b) "The reason I am against Islam is not because it is a religion but because it is a political movement of imperialism and domination in the guise of religion."

He says Islam is not a religion in the first quote then he says it is in the second quote, and again in the latter part of the second sentence he says Islam is not a religion. Exactly what Mr Sina is trying to tell us I will let the audiences judge that and he doe not posses a "logical gun" but an "illogical and irrational gun"!

On Nazism and Fascism - Mr Sina says: "Do the Nazis have the right to have their party and promote their cause? I don't know of any democratic country that allows such thing. Most democratic systems ban racist and fascist movements."

Well, almost all leading democracies, including US and Europe permits Nazi parties and the likes to operate e.g. the "US Nazi Party" started by Lincoln Rockwell, the "British National Party" of Nick Griffin, and Vlaamsblok in Belgium etc. This is common knowledge. As for Nazis who will decide who is a Nazi or not. It is Mr Sina who is trying to HYPOCRITICALLY dictate to those whom he considers to be Nazis and Fascists like a Nazi. Nazism and Fascism were born amongst democracies not ISLAM. Its birth place and practice was in Europe. Both pertain to the exaltation of their races as their central theme which is diametrically opposed to ISLAM! Why Mr Sina uses such words to charge other when he does not even have the basic rudimentary knowledge on the subject!

On Democracy and Dictatorship - Mr Sina says: "Democracy does not mean dictatorship of the majority. It does not mean letting fascism come to power democratically to behead that democracy. Hitler and Khomeini came to power through popular vote. But they did not bring democracy. They strangulated it."

So if democracy is not the dictatorship of majority then is it dictatorship of minority? Since he is implying that democracy is the rule of the people for the people by the people but not if it violates Ali Sina's golden rule"! Who ever decides arbitrarily a party or idea is or is not in compliance to democracy is in fact by definition a dictator. After all the acrobatics of what democracy is not Mr Sina could not say what democracy is. The more he elaborates the more he exposes his weaknesses, contradictions and intellectual bankruptcy.

Then Mr. Sina claims "democracy protects minority", well not really! In fact minorities are at the mercy of majority rule of democracy or the Capitalist elites. Those 'rights' of minorities can be changed overnight as we all saw the so-called human rights abolished overnight in Camp-X-ray, Bagram, Belmarsh, Abu-Ghraib etc. Minorities are no more or no less safe than the Jews as minorities were safe living in democratic Germany in the 1930s or the Japanese living within the US just after Perl Harbour! Only recently democratic societies have learnt to display a semblance of tolerate after two world wars and centuries of intolerance and genocide!

On Freedom of Belief - Mr Sina says: "Banning Islam is not in contradiction with democracy and freedom of thought." Freedom means unrestrained, opposite of banning or censoring. You cannot logically have both operating at the same time and then call it freedom! Once you put any constraint on freedom by definition it ceases to be free, however for political propaganda people wave the word 'freedom' even when they not only impose restrictions but use their military powers to kill, rape and loot in its name!

He said earlier that anyone can believe in any fairy tale as long as it does not say "they should kill others". Is that not Mr Sina dictating to others now? His attitude towards Muslim, or banning of the Quran and Islam, is a carbon copy of what was preached by Nazi intellectuals, like Streicher. So, by default, Sina behaves like a Fascist, Nazi himself. Then Mr Sina makes his fantastic claim that is illogical, laughable and pretty stupid. He says "I believe in nothing", and he also stated "I have no religion. I do not believe in anything. I am a freethinker."

I did not mention religion but merely asked for his alternative to Islam. In any case, religion essentially is a viewpoint towards life and its purpose. Any alternative you give on that position regardless of what you call it you have a position, i.e. a religion. Hence everyone has a religion but it might not be a main stream one that is established and tested for centuries with billions of followers! So the statement of not believing is meaningless because that in itself constitutes a belief, a viewpoint. It is the same as saying that there should be no laws in society which by default itself becomes a law, enforced and dictated. Or as illogical as saying that we are free but except don't cross the line ("Golden Rule") drawn by Mr Sina!

Who is bungled up on the issue of Abu-Ghraib?

Mr Sina is the one bungled up exposing his gross ignorance by regurgitated the cheap propaganda of the rightwing establishment like the so many migrant coolies! Abu-Ghraib was 'abuse', "letting of steam", and "cheer leader exercise" to the US establishment but to the Iraqis it was "murder", "torture", "kidnappings" and "humiliation" by the American gangsters. A lot more happened in Abu-Ghraib, Umm Qasr and other US-run prisons then Mr Sina suggests. Seymour Hirsh saw the video clips of young teen and pre-teen boys screeching whilst being sodomised by US soldiers. Yes, the real Paedophiles not the imaginary ones claimed by Mr Sina. The US senator said after seeing the pictures and videos, "it was like descending into hell but unfortunately it was our creation". There are accounts of necrophilia and many disappearing in that horror chamber.

Please remember not what was seen but what was not caught on camera and what was caught but not shown. Also, not to mention we have not heard the Iraqi side of the story! Why? Unfair media coverage and the Iraqis have honour and dignity; they are not going to turn up on the Jerry Springer show discussing their most intimate details as if they are some kind of animals devoid of shame! Yes the Jerry Springer folks are the product of the society advocated by 'freethinkers'; climbing the tree of the "Golden Rule" like chimpanzees!

As for what the US did to the few escape goats offering light sentences does not remotely constitute justice and largely propaganda trials. So that the likes of Mr Sina can feel good that 'democracy' is working. As the crimes were committed on Iraqi soil they should have been judged by the Iraqis and had the situation been reversed this is exactly what the US would have demanded!

Then Mr Sina brings the incident of Kinnan (from the Life of the Prophet (SAW)) which is incorrect analogy. Kinnan was executed for violating the terms agreement with the Muslims. Remember the so-called "Golden Rule" has no way of determining the level of retribution that should be given. The incident was not sadistic torture of innocents like in Abu-Ghraib style for 'fun' and satisfying sexual perversions, so the analogy is incorrect. Furthermore, the Prophet by his actions is defining a law so which other laws can be used to judge Him as a Prophet? Indeed Mr Sina is confused on basic principles.

Twisted Morality and Iraq War

The birth of US was soaked in the blood of seventy million peaceful Native Americans, followed by the brutal African slave trade. Then the colonial expedition of terrorising the world started with the phoney Spanish-American wars killing over 500,000 Philippinos and she also terrorised Central and Latin America. The killing of innocent civilians climaxed in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, Vietnam, Korea, etc. where the art of real mass terrorism was developed. I can go on giving endless examples. Yet none of this seems to register in Mr Sina's scale of twisted morality. Mr Sina needs to understand that the US is propelled by corporate profit as a capitalist state not by any principle like the so-called "Golden-Rule".

The criminality of the Iraq war was in violation of the UN charter clearly stated by Kofi Anan and the rest of the international community. Iraq has NEVER launched an attack against the US or UK in its short history hence the war was unprovoked. The US also violated Mr Sina's "Golden Rule" since if you don't like to be attacked or invaded you should not do that to others constantly in distant lands. Hence, any subsequent attacks or deaths as a result of this illegal war are to be blamed on the US. Yet, Mr Sina refers to humanity but note the vast majority of HUMANITY actually opposed the US aggression as massive demonstrations all over the world including within the US and UK, coupled with the opinion polls clearly proved this point. It is Mr. Sina that is on the side of true inhumanity that is dispensed by the US military.

Mr Sina then has the gall to speak on behalf of the Iraqis without even asking them. If the Iraqis were happy with the US they would not be killing the US soldiers daily and the freedom fighters could not operate without the support of the indigenous Iraqi population. The earlier opinion polls showed 92% - 95% viewed the US as occupiers. If the Iraqis felt liberated the US soldiers would be showered with roses not bombs and bullets and their leaders would not be sneaking in and out of Iraq like oil-thieves and pirates.

Mr Sina makes laughable claims like "Americans never target the civilians, never kill non-combatants" as if he is a guest on Fox-TV. This is the apex of ignorance and not just the Iraqis but the Vietnamese, Japanese, Koreans, South Americans, Hispanic, Afro-Americans and a long list of people would certainly disagree about the US not targeting civilians. As stated earlier the US and UK practically invented the art. There are even videos on the net showing US soldiers executing Iraqi civilians for fun. The eminent TV journalist John Pilger showed in a TV documentary that farmers in desolate places were bombed even the sheep were not spared! When the US drops 500 pound bombs on civilian areas instead of letting their 'brave' marines in for a hand-to-hand combats claims of not deliberately targeting civilians is irrational. Now wonder the US does not want to sign up to the International Criminal Court.

It is the American gangsters who have come across the ocean to kidnap people, committing high-tech beheadings en masse using missiles and bombs. This is acceptable to Mr Sina's twisted morality but not the couple of beheadings done in retaliation using the low-tech methods of knives. The Nazis detached themselves from the victims as they released the gas from the distance, just like Mr Sina is absorbing the sanitised version of the war as morally superior from a distance! Mr Sina is the one displaying true Nazi like behaviour. How perverted and sick yet he has the audacity to charge others with Nazism and twisted morality! If Mr Sina was attacked by burning Phosphorus or Napalm bombs he would be begging Musab Al-Zarqawi to behead him in order to relive the pain. Even the father of Nick Berg courageously made this point that at least his son was not tortured to death like the Iraqis suffered in the horror chambers of Abu-Ghraib and Camp-X-Ray!

Anyway, I can go on refuting few of his remaining points but Mr Sina has enough on his plate and his first task will be to prove his so-called "Golden-Rule" otherwise no allegations can be brought forward and he would be in violation of his first rule as explained earlier.

Ali Sina responds to part III from Yamin Zakaria

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Golden Rule
You called the Golden Rule "Ali Sina's cult" and asked me to "prove the legitimacy of the Golden Rule".
The Golden Rule is as old as humanity. It is commonsense Mr. Zakaria. What on earth is more self evident than "Do onto others as you would wish them do onto you"? This is actually the common theme in almost all the religions. I will quote this principle as stated by various religions based on alphabetical order.

Islam is the only religion that does not adhere to the Golden Rule (and I am glad that you admit that). The closest that Islam comes to this principle is a hadith that says
"None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself." Number 13 of Imam "Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths."
This brotherhood however does not extend to everyone. Quran (9:23) states that the believers should not take for friends and protectors (awlia) their fathers and brothers if they love Infidelity above Islam. In fact there are many verses that tell the Muslims to kill the unbelievers and be harsh with them. A clear example that Islam is not based on the Golden Rule is the verse (48:29) It says: "Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other."
This is the perfect definition of fascism. There are many other verses that show the brotherhood in Islam is not universal. The rest of mankind have no rights and should not be treated in the same way that Muslims are to be treated. The entire Quran is the breach of the Golden Rule. Quran tells Muslims to slay the unbelievers wherever they find them (2:191), do not befriend them (3:28), fight them and show them harshness (9:123), and smite their heads (47:4).
In my debate with Mr. Edip Yuksel, the leader of the sect of Submitters, I quoted a few verses from the Quran switching the places of "Muslims" and "non-Muslims". Here are a few of them:
8:12 We will cast terror into the hearts of Muslims. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.
9:5, Then fight and slay the Muslims wherever ye find them,
47:4, Therefore, when ye meet the Muslims, smite at their necks; At length.
Mr. Yuksel was outraged. He called me a "theo-fascist" and wrote: 'His [Ali Sina's] "subhuman" remark was the last, but a venomous drop that filled his cup of hatred and bigotry. He is not a person to reason with, since his mind is filled with toxic hate and his stomach is thirsty for fresh blood.." All that because I quoted the verse of the Quran switching the places of "Muslims" and "non-Muslims"!

Muslims like to do all these evil things to others but they do not like reciprocation. As you rightly said it Islam is not in conformity with the Golden Rule.

In all the religions, the Golden Rule applies. This is not to say that I agree with these religions. They are a mix bag of good and bad. but Islam is the only religion that is bereft of any good. The Golden Rule is the inner compass with which all the sane people can distinguish between right and wrong. Its application is very simple. I don't like to be killed, so I must not kill. I do not like to be robbed, so I must not rob. I don't like to be lied to, so I must not lie. I do not like my wife or daughter be raped, so I must not rape someone else's wife or daughter, etc. The Golden Rule is an unerring compass. In fact it is so unerring that religions become superfluous. People without religion can follow this Rule and find their way unerringly.

Now let us see why Islam is the only religion that does not follow the Golden Rule. The answer is that all other religions were human constructs and many of those humans were good people, but Islam is made by a very demonic mind. Either Muhammad was a messenger of Satan or he was a psychopath. Personally I do not believe in the existence of Satan. Therefore I would say he was a psychopath.
Dr. Sam Vaknin, the author of Malignant Self Love in an article titled The Cult of the Narcissist writes:
"The narcissist's control is based on ambiguity, unpredictability, fuzziness, and ambient abuse. His ever-shifting whims exclusively define right versus wrong, desirable and unwanted, what is to be pursued and what to be avoided. He alone determines the rights and obligations of his disciples and alters them at will."

This is exactly how one can describe the teachings of Muhammad. His definition of right and wrong are not based on the Golden Rule. They are whimsical. Some things are halal (licit) and other things are haram (illicit). What is lalal or haram is not self evident. They are based entirely on his whims.

We can understand Muhammad better if we study another psychopath cult leader and compare the two together. Let us take the example of Jim Jones who founded the People's Temple and his followers drank poison-laced Cool Aid and committed mass suicide to prove their loyalty to him.

Jeanne Mills, one of the better-educated members of People's Temple who escaped the cult but later was assassinated by a cult member (cult leaders don't tolerate dissention) commented: "I was amazed at how little disagreement there was between the members of this church. Before we joined the church, Al and I couldn't even agree on whom to vote for in a presidential election. Now that we all belonged to a group, family arguments were becoming a thing of the past. There was never a question of who was right, because Jim was always right. When our large household met to discuss family problems, we didn't ask for opinions. Instead, we put the question to the children, "What would Jim do?" It took the difficulty out of life. There was a type of "manifest destiny" which said the Cause was right and would succeed. Jim was right and those who agreed with him were right. If you disagreed with Jim, you were wrong. It was as simple as that. [Mills, 1979]

This is exactly how Muslims behave. Muslims follow two things, one is the Quran and the other is the Sunnah. The Quran is the words of Muhammad (claimed to be Allah's) and the Sunnah are the life examples of Muhammad. The details of the Sunnah are described in the voluminous books of Ahadith (Plural of hadith). The doctors of Islamic law study for years to master these details and the believers do not do anything without consulting these doctors and learning the correct way of doing things. Sunnah is in effect the Islamic "prescription for living" based on the examples set by Muhammad and how he lived. These are the details about Muhammad's life reported by his companions and wives. Through Sunnah Muslims learn how to perform prayers, how to do ablution, how to clean their nose, their feet and their ears; how to eat, what to eat and what not to eat, how to sleep, how to dress and how to shave. They learn how to copulate, how to defecate and how to urinate, with which foot enter the toilet and on which one place most of the weight while evacuating. They learn which direction to face during defecation or urination and how many pebbles to use for cleaning purposes after the call of the nature and with which hand to clean one's private parts. They learn what length of the penis can enter the vagina without annulling their fast and how to clean after having a wet dream, or even how to fondle their wives and enjoy them when they are menstruating. Everything is detailed. Every action is prescribed. All believers have to do is spend years learning these "important" examples set by Muhammad and follow them mindlessly and meticulously in the fond belief that he will have fulfilled his duty as a Muslim and will be rewarded for his "good" deeds.
