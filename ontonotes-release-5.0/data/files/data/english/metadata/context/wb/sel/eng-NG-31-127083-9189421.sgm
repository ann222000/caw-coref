Missed this one, sorry. Not good here - smoking again. My meter (which
still runs) show's I'd be at 2M and 3W if it took.

I got too depressed to continue. Turns out that what I was saying
about Chantix was true. DON'T TAKE CHANTIX... IF you are a heavy
drinker or prone to depression... or in my case BOTH!

Thanks for checking up me.

Yeah.  If you're prone to depression and a heavy drinker and your
doctor gives you Chantix, one of you needs to be fired.

It's good to hear backfrom you Gary. I do hope you will regroup and
charge again soon.
Whatever you do, remember we do care!
