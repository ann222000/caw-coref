In another thread Rich mentioned The Wings of the Dove which I will be
sure to rent 'cause I love watching movies for &quot;stuff&quot;. But my vote
for the best &quot;antique&quot; movie has got to be &quot;The Mummy&quot; (the one made in
the 50's) My friends and I (and a houseful of kids) watched this movie
on Halloween night and most of the adults spent their viewing time
&quot;ooing and awing&quot; over the fabulous antiques in the movie. My
choice for a recent movie with cool stuff is &quot;Casper&quot; - great lamps!

I used to like the one with Shirley Temple in an orphanage,where they
thought that her father had been killed in battle (he wasn't) and they
made her live in the attic.....

Since my mind is worse than any sieve, I can only
report the last &quot;antique&quot; movie I saw. Sunday.

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is set in
Savannah, Georgia -- and the contents of Jim Williams'
home are truly amazing.

As is the rest of Savannah. ;)

Check out &quot;Rear Window&quot; with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. The
furnishings are not that great, but if you are into vintage clothes and
jewelry, Grace Kelly will just knock you dead. And, that antique wheel
chair of Jimmy's might innerest ya! And besides, it's pretty
suspensful!! Susan

I remember some years ago recommending American Graffiti to my daughter
&amp; boyfriend. Was amazed to hear they watched it with the sound off,
just to concentrate on the &quot;antique&quot; cars from the 50's - and you guys
thought this was a new idea!!

One of the reasons I always surf over to the American Movie
Channel, besides the fact that I'm crazy about Katherine Hepburn,
Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart (etc., etc) movies, is to
see some of the now-antique (or at least collectible) items
shown in the films.

A couple years ago (maybe Connie S. can help out with this if
she reads this thread), AntiqueWeek did a story on a woman,
I believe in Indiana, who does a booming business selling
props to Hollywood studios. Not so much furniture and large items,
but little things like old detergent boxes and soda bottles...
everyday sorts of things that add an authentic touch.

On a related note, a few summers ago, when I was able to put
my freelance work aside for a few days, I volunteered to be
an extra in _My Summer Story_, the sequel (sort of) to that
Christmas movie about the kid who wanted a Red Ryder BB gun
for Christmas.

The scenes I was in were filmed in three grand old movie
theatres here in Cleveland, so I didn't get to see many
home interior props. But there was one funny thing. The
&quot;bit&quot; that those theatre scenes revolved around was the
free china that movie theatres used to give out to drum up
business. The premise was that this theatre was giving out
china with movie stars images on it and that it was about
the 3rd week running for gravy boats (I forget the name
of the movie idol whose face appeared on 'em).

The movie-goers were not taking it anymore, and they (we)
threw their gravy boats at the emcee on the stage. The
items we threw were actually very dense styrofoam of some
sort, painted with a pearlized-looking glaze to make
them look real.

In another scene we played &quot;Beeno,&quot; a forerunner (or copycat) of
bingo, with dried beans used as markers. I could almost imagine
I was back in the 1940s. What a hoot it was!

The extras had to show up in vintage clothing, or at least in
clothing classic enough to top off with an authentic hat or
coat to make it look real. I wore my aunt's lovely little silk-
flower-decorated straw hat that she was married in, in the
early 40s.

Sorry to get farther off the semi-off-topic thread, but this
one reminded me of one of the most fun experiences I've had.
Mary Steenbergen, btw, was delightful and looked like a
natural in the vintage dresses the costume people drummed
up for her.

Thanks for stirring up this bit of nostalgia, Rich. :)

Why wasn't the movie &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; mentioned. When Christopher
Reeve goes back in time, the vintage clothing and antiques in the hotel
are fantastique (sp?).

"/> Probably because most folks had pretty much written off the movie and it had
been universally panned when it was released in 1980. Despite the weak plot, I
don't think Jane Seymour ever looked better. However, people in the audience
did giggle a lot each time when the camera held onto the dreamy look in
Christopher's eyes just about three beats too long. It was filmed here in
Michigan at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island and it didn't take too much
effort to make the hotel look period and elegant, as it still is. There are no
motorized vehicles allowed on the Island (Except for a well hidden fire engine
and ambulance) and you do have a real time warp feeling when you go there-
about a half hour ferry ride. There are periodic &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; events at
the hotel that draw hundreds of people, most in costume, and our local
Victorian Society Chapter had also done a weekend program there in appropriate
outfits. There is an Antique Show there every Fall, so I guess you could write
it off as a buying trip. Start saving now as their rack rate starts about
$300/night for 2 people/ 1 bed, but that's MAP. There's also a lot of B&amp;B's but
the season is short- about May to October. If you want to just look at the
hotel up close, they now charge (I think it's about $5.00 each) to wander on
the porch and the public areas. Those people are called &quot;Fudgies&quot; as the
usually have one hand perpetually loading fudge from one of the many wharfside
stores into their mouth; probably the money just covers the removal of the
sticky fingerprints.

A little &quot;Factoid&quot;-- The film was originally scripted to be shot at equally
beautiful and elegant Hotel Del Coronado on the island of the same name off San
Diego, but there were too many problems like eliminating all the autos,
interrupting the hotel operations, etc. (Other films were done there including
&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;) If you go there, you can see the details in a display in
one of the lower common hallways. The furnishings aren't Grand Hotel, but the
woodwork alone is worth the trip. And the whole site is a reminder of a time
when hotels were an event, not just a place to get through the night.

The last time I was there my room opened on the beautiful inner courtyard,
where at sunset there was a piano being played below; after a few classical
selections the music changed to the &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; score.....Sadly, for at
that part of my trip, I was alone. &lt;BIG Sigh&gt; But don't feel really sorry for
me, as there was a large group of us, and, by Friday a friend from Dana Point
made the rest of the stay worthwhile.
