Daily Reflections

THE KEYSTONE

He is the Father, and we are His children. Most good
ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of
the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to
freedom.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 62

A keystone is the wedge-shaped piece at the highest part
of an arch that locks the other pieces in place. The
"other pieces" are Steps One, Two, and Four through
Twelve. In one sense this sounds like Step Three is the
most important Step, that the other eleven depend on
the third for support. In reality however, Step Three
is just one of twelve. It is the keystone, but without
eleven other stones to build the base and the arms,
keystone or not, there will be no arch. Through working
of all Twelve Steps, I find that triumphant arch waiting
for me to pass through to another day of freedom.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

Can I get well? If I mean: "Can I ever drink normally
again," the answer is no. But if I mean, "Can I stay sober?"
the answer is definitely yes. I can get well by turning
my drink problem over to a Power greater than myself, that
Divine Principle in the universe which we call God, and
by asking that Power each morning to give me the strength
to stay sober for the next twenty-four hours. I know from
the experience of thousands of people that if I honestly
want to get well, I can get well. Am I faithfully following the
A.A. program?

Meditation For The Day

Persevere in all that God's guidance moves you to do.
The persistent carrying out of what seems right and good
will bring you to that place where you would be. If you
look back over God's guidance, you will see that His
leading has been very gradual and that only as you have
carried out His wishes, as far as you can understand them,
has God been able to give you more clear and definite
leading. Man is led by God's touch on a quickened
responsive mind.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that I may persevere in what seems right. I pray
that I may carry out all of God's leading, as far as I
can understand it.

As Bill Sees It

Hard On Ourselves, Considerate Of Others, p.240

We cannot disclose anything to our wives or our parents which will
hurt them and make them unhappy. We have no right to save our own
skins at their expense.

Such damaging parts of our story we tell to someone else who will
understand, yet be unaffected. The rule is, we must be hard on
ourselves, but always considerate of others.

********************************

Good judgment will suggest that we ought to take our time in making
amends to our families. It may be unwise at first to rehash certain
harrowing episodes. While we may be quite willing to reveal the very
worst, we must be sure to remember that we cannot buy our own
peace of mind at the expense of others.

Walk in Dry Places

*Living with depression___Mood management
Getting sober is often only a first small step in getting well. Many
recovering alcoholics must also face an underlying depression that seems
to mock their efforts to attain real serenity. But sobriety does not
cause the depression. It simply lays bare a condition that was present
all along, but had been masked by repeated binges. It's probably true,
too, that many of us used alcohol partly as a drug to combat depression
because it temporarily lifted our mood and relieved our pain.
One fact about depression is that it comes and goes; we can endure it
partly by knowing that "this too shall pass."  Another fact is that
physical activity helps in copying with it.  AA co-founder Bill W.,
victimized by profound depression even in his sober years, found that
walking provided some relief, though he had to force himself to do it at
times. A third fact about depression is that we can usually alleviate
its effects by helping others and by staying close to AA circles, even
when we're too depressed to contribute much.  It's also helpful to
discuss the problem with understanding friends and sponsors, or a
therapist, if necessary.
I'll believe today that I can maintain a good mood level that continues
to build as I carry out my responsibilities and make AA first in my
life. Depression may challenge me, but I don't have to give in to it.*

*Keep It Simple

** Archie doesn't know how to worry without getting upset. --- Edith Bunker
Most us are like Edith's television husband, Archie. When we worry, we
get upset. Problems seem too big for us. We get afraid. We feel
powerless. What does the program tell us to do when we feel powerless
and our life is upset? We look at the problem honestly . Than we ask our
Higher Power to help us with the problem. We take it One Day at a Time.
We believe our Higher Power will take care of us and help. We'll have
problems. That's life! But we can get through them with care and
support. We don't have to get crazy. We don't have to make things worst.
We can be kind to ourselves and live through problems just fine---with
our Higher Powers help.
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, help me do what I can today about my
problems. Help me stop worrying.
Action for the Day:  If I have problems today, I'll do what I can---and
leave the outcome to my Higher Power.*

Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

*ME AN ALCOHOLIC? - Alcohol's wringer squeezed this author--but he
escaped quite whole.
*

*I'd had absolute faith in science, and only in science.  "Knowledge is
power," I'd always been taught.  Now I had to face up to the fact that
knowledge of this sort, applied to my individual case, was not power.
Science could take my mind apart expertly, but it couldn't seem to put
it together again.  I crawled back to my analyst, not so much because I
had faith in him, but because I had nowhere else to turn.*

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Step Seven - "Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings."

We saw we needn't always be bludgeoned and beaten into humility. It
could come quite as much from our voluntary reaching for it as it could
from unremitting suffering. A great turning point in our lives came when
we sought for humility as something we really wanted, rather than as
something we must have. It marked the time when we could commence to see
the full implication of Step Seven: "Humbly asked Him to remove our
shortcomings."

p. 75

"Happiness is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with
it."
--Anon.

Courage can't see around corners, but goes around them anyway.
--Mignon McLaughlin

I have a capacity in my soul for taking in God entirely. I am as sure
as I live that nothing is so near to me as God. God is nearer to me
than I am to myself; my existence depends on the nearness and the
presence of God.
--Meister Eckhart

Never does the human soul appear so strong and noble as when it
forgoes revenge and dares to forgive injury.
--Edwin Hubbel Chapin

The gift of the Spirit is that we are God's children.
--Rita Jorgensen

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

WINE

"Wine that maketh glad the
heart of man."
-- Psalm 104:15

Every good thing can be abused and alcohol is no exception. Although
most people are able to enjoy the fruits of the grape and the quality
of their lives are enriched by good wine, not a few are destroyed by
wine! Millions of people in this world are alcoholic. They did not want
to be alcoholic but they are. Their lives and relationships are
destroyed by alcohol. They need to stop drinking if they are to find
"gladness" in their lives. Alcoholism is a disease that cannot be
cured, but it can be arrested by giving up the grape!

God can be appreciated in the grape, but He can also be experienced
in the soda. We need to find new ways to be happy.

Thank You for the precious gift of choice.

***********************************************************

"Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall
glorify Me."
Psalms 50:15

"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
Psalms 51:10

Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put their trust
in Him.
Proverbs 30:5

"For I know the plans that I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans
for welfare
and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah 29:11

How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be
called children of
God! And that is what we are!
1 John 3:1

Daily Inspiration

Treat your family as you would treat a best friend. Lord, help me to
treasure my family with all of their imperfections as well as my own and
cherish the time we have together.

Do not act as though you are watching a parade because we are each one
of the marchers. Lord, things change so quickly. Help me to celebrate
the constant newness of my life.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
