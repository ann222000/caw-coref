&gt; You are making yourself look foolish. The book on Grebes by Andre
&gt; Konter that was published in 2001 was entitled 'Grebes of OUR World'.
&gt; My book, published only this month, is entitled 'Grebes of THE World',
&gt; and as such is entirely different. The similarity of the front covers
&gt; is quite coincidental. My book IS the first ever devoted to Grebes.

LOL I think it is you who is sounding somewhat foolish :-(
So yours IS the first book ever called 'Grebes of THE World' and a
book
published earlier called 'Grebes of OUR World' is not a book 'devoted'
to
Grebes - is this what you are trying to tell us? I think the emperor
is
without clothes.

Avoid the rush at the last judgement. Be converted now instead!

PRAYER FOR A NATION

When Pastor Joe Wright, of Central Christian Church, was asked
to open the new session of the Kansas Senate, everyone was expecting
the usual politically correct generalities.
But what they heard instead was this:

Heavenly Father, we come before You today to ask Your forgiveness
and seek your direction and guidance.
We know Your Word says,
‘Woe on those who call evil good,’ but that’s exactly what we have done.
We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and inverted our values.

We confess that:

We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it pluralism;

We have, worshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism;

We have endorsed perversion and called it an alternative lifestyle;

We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery;

We have neglected the needy and called it self-preservation;

We have killed our unborn and called it choice;

We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem;

We have abused power and called it political savvy;

We have coveted our neighbour’s possessions and called it ambition;

We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression;

We have ridiculed the time-honoured values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.

Search us, 0 God, and know our hearts today; try us and see if there be some wicked way in us;
cleanse us from every sin and set us free. Guide and bless these men and women who have
been sent here by the people of Kansas, and who have been ordained by You, to govern this great state.

Grant them Your wisdom to rule and may their decisions direct us to the centre of Your will. I ask it in the name of Your Son, the Living Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.”

An Adventure in the Life of King James V of Scotland
ON one occasion King James the Fifth of Scotland, when alone, in disguise,
Near by the Bridge of Cramond met with rather a disagreeable surprise.
He was attacked by five gipsy men without uttering a word,
But he manfully defended himself with his sword.

There chanced to be a poor man threshing corn in a barn near by,
Who came out on hearing the noise so high;
And seeing one man defending himself so gallantly,
That he attacked the gipsies with his flail, and made them flee.

Then he took the King into the barn,
Saying, &quot;I hope, sir, you've met with no great harm;
And for five men to attack you, it's a disgrace;
But stay, I'll fetch a towel and water to wash your face.&quot;

And when the King washed the blood off his face and hands,
&quot;Now, sir, I wish to know who you are,&quot; the King demands.
&quot;My name, sir, is John Howieson, a bondsman on the farm of Braehead.&quot;
&quot;Oh, well,&quot; replied the King, &quot;your company I need not dread.&quot;

&quot;And perhaps you'll accompany me a little way towards Edinburgh,
Because at present I'm not free from sorrow.
And if you have any particular wish to have gratified,
Let me know it, and it shall not be denied.&quot;

Then honest John said, thinking it no harm,
&quot;Sir, I would like to be the owner of Braehead farm;
But by letting me know who you are it would give my mind relief.&quot;
Then King James he answered that he was the Gudeman of Ballingeich.

&quot;And if you'll meet me at the palace on next Sunday,
Believe me, for your manful assistance, I'll you repay.
Nay, honest John, don't think of you I'm making sport,
I pledge my word at least you shall see the royal court.&quot;

So on the next Sunday John put on his best clothes,
And appeared at the palace gate as~you may suppose.
And he inquired for the Gudeman of Ballingeich;
And when he gained admittance his heart was freed from grief.

For John soon found his friend the Gudeman,
And the King took John by the han',
Then conducted John from one apartment to another,
Just as kindly as if he'd been his own brother.

Then the King asked John if he'd like to see His Majesty.
&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied John, &quot;His Majesty I would really like to see.&quot;
And John looked earnestly into the King's face,
And said, &quot;How am I to know His Grace?&quot;

&quot;Oh, John, you needn't be the least annoyed about that,
For all heads will be uncovered: the King will wear his hat.&quot;
Then he conducted John into a large hall,
Which was filled by the nobility, crown officers, and all.

Then said John to the King, when he looked round the room,
&quot;Sir, I hope I will see the King very soon.&quot;
Because to see the King, John rather dreaded,
At last he said to the King, &quot;'Tis you! the rest are bare-headed.&quot;

Then the King said, &quot;John, I give you Braehead farm as it stands,
On condition you provide a towel and basin of water to wash my hands,
If ever I chance to come your way.
Then John said, &quot;Thanks to your Majesty, I'll willingly obey.&quot;
