ALBUM REVIEW

Cliks Turn Pain Into Rock Art

April 24, 2007

By ERIC R. DANTON, Courant Rock Critic

AUSTIN, Texas -- After years of fretting over every little detail,
Lucas Silveira finally learned to let go. Naturally, that's when
things started to happen: A strong new lineup for his band, the
Cliks; a record deal that releases the group's U.S.
debut, "Snakehouse," today on Silver Label, the rock imprint of Tommy
Boy; and a momentous personal decision when Silveira, a biological
woman, began living as a transgender man.

As he shed his tendency to micromanage, the Toronto rock singer,
songwriter and guitarist found a new freedom in his music and in his
life.

"I was really scared by the idea of letting go of that control,"
Silveira says, tucked into a velvety couch in the bar of the Driskill
Hotel one afternoon during this year's South by Southwest Music
Festival. "I was a control freak, now I'm so happy not to be a
control freak."

Giving up control didn't come without its costs, however. The
visceral rock songs on "Snakehouse" were born out of emotional
turmoil stemming from a series of personal dramas in 2005. His father
had a stroke, a long-term relationship crumbled and Silveira began
acknowledging he was transgender.

"There were a lot of transitions I was going through in my life," he
says.

Silveira turned his pain into art, finding catharsis by writing
emotionally bruising songs. Although he had already established the
Cliks on the Toronto club scene, he didn't feel the other musicians
in the band were capable of developing the tunes. So he added to the
turbulence around him and replaced them with more experienced players.

New arrivals Morgan Doctor on drums and Jordan B. Wright on bass
helped Silveira flesh out his songs during recording sessions
for "Snakehouse," produced by fellow Canadian Moe Berg.

Doctor cites a musical rapport that, combined with the musicians'
creative drive, helped Silveira to pare back from obsessive oversight
as the songs took shape. (Wright has since left the band; her
replacement is Jen Benton. The Cliks also recently added a second
guitarist, Nina Martinez.)

"They met every expectation and beyond," Silveira says. "They served
the songs, which is what players have to do."

The result is a brawny, powerful rock album, full of gritty guitar
riffs and raw, tuneful vocals that some have likened to the early
sound of the Pretenders. Silveira is flattered by the comparison.

"I grew up listening to the Pretenders, because my older sister did,"
he says, also citing Jeff Buckley, Jane's Addiction and the Beatles
as influences.

Listening to his sister's records wasn't all Silveira was doing as a
child: He was singing, too, constantly.

"I've been singing since I was born, essentially," he says with a
laugh. "I wasn't always extremely confident in my voice. It's just a
growth process."

"Lucas doesn't stop," Martinez jokes from an opposite sofa in the
Driskill bar. "We'll be driving along in the car, and he's singing or
whistling the whole time."

Although the circumstances that prompted Silveira to write the songs
on "Snakehouse" included his struggle with gender identification, he
says that's not what the album is about. Rather, he strives to write
songs with the most relatable message possible.

"Identity, I think, is something that's universal," he says. "It's a
focus for everybody."

The same sentiment applies to the cover tune on "Snakehouse," a taut
version of Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River."

"When I first heard that song, it really related to something I was
going through at the time," he says. "It expressed an anger I was
feeling."

Timberlake released the song only a few years ago, and it's certainly
not obscure. Still, Silveira had no reservations about including his
own version.

"It's just a good song," he says. "It's a song about relationships,
it's a song about mistrust."

It seems fitting, too, that the Cliks took a song with certain pop
connotations and reimagined it for a rock audience.

"It's good to break down people's perceptions of anything," Silveira
says.
