I've posted the concept earlier, here's something to make your DM really
hate you:

A 7th lvl Cleric with a Healing Domain, Augment Healing feat and a
Lesser Metamagic Extend Rod casting Mass Lesser Vigor (a 3rd lvl spell)
cures 7 HP + (1 HP / rnd) for next 35 rounds to 4 creatures. That's up
to 4 x 42 = 168 HP with a single spell!
First lvl spell Lesser Vigor heals 3 + 35 x 1 = 38 HP to a single crature!
Of course you could just have those spells Extended via regular or
Sudden feat, but 9k GP price makes this precious Rod a must have for any
Cleric.

Broken?

Nah, it would have been broken if it was dual-classed with Paladin! Adding
LOH to that monster would have broken the game and they would have had
to recall all the books and start over with D&amp;D 4.0!

Hehe actually, since the DM could use those ideas against you, it balances
itself.
Yes, your cleric could be strong, but then so could the cleric in the NPC
party
you face. Or mix it with an evil cleric that commands undead. Your cleric
idea
would be TOTALLY focused on healing, so would be behind the curve at
fighting
against normal CR7 foes. He would be slinging healing spells faster to keep
his
bodyguards alive. And nothing says &quot;waste&quot; like casting your 168 pt heal on
someone
who only has 50 hp to begin with.

It's actualy 42 to 4 different persons, and it's not much of a combat
spell cause it takes 3.5 minutes.
Everything a PC comes up with, could be used against him. Once, or twice

9kgp is 12 Wands of CLW, for 3300hp cured and no spell slots used
(twice that with Lesser Vigor). You'll be casting scores of spells to
get the same total effect, oh, and the rod only works 3/day so it's
likely taking your entire career to make up the cost difference. Plus,
someone with the wands gets to use those few spells each day for
something else, like another 1000hp healing or more over the levels.
A wand user doesn't have to bother with Augment Healing, and can
share them around.

Sudden costs a feat for 1/day. *Never* worth it when you could
take &quot;Extra Slot&quot; and cast another /Heal/ spell. With the regular feat
you're better to just use the higher level Vigor spells.

Either way, it takes 20 minutes to get the 42 hp each, and no
speeding it up, so to heal up a damaged high level party would take
*hours*, and you still need quicker healing available for emergencies.

Overall, I call it a munchkin trap, and not a very good one.

Eh eh, my bad - Rod costs 3k actualy! That's 4 wands of CLW for average
of 1100 (and it takes 200 rounds to cast'em!). It would take about 8
rounds *of casting* to achieve 44 HP, you only cast a single spell with
rod. Not to mention other possible uses (almost any buff spell, etc.)

20 mins?! 3.5 actually. And nothing stops you from casting it twice, so
its 84 hp for 4 persons in 3m36s.
It's great after combat, but using it at the begining of some

So now it's only taking a few levels to make up the difference.
Pearls of Power are still better for the 1st and 2nd level stuff

You're right about that. But don't forget you need to cast CLW each
round, you only cast MLV once! Then you concentrate on fighting villans,
or simply healing whoever needs that 4d8+16 CCW at the moment.

When 90% of the time all you really needed was a couple charges

There's no need to waste time 'making sure they're not actually dead'.
Take a shot at him; if he's dead, no harm done, if he wasn't, he
probably is now.  Or he was faking it.

'Make sure they stay down and aren't bluffing'.  Wasting a bullet on a
corpse is way better than having it not be a corpse and get up.

My intelligent monsters and NPCs will often happily take a moment to
make sure of an enemy who's gone down, for just this reason, unless they

I prefer playing in games that act like this.  Yes, it's annoying to
have one of my characters die, but it's even more annoying to see the DM
have the monsters do tactically dumb things because he's afraid he'll
hurt my feelings.

I had a swordsage die a few sessions ago (note: minotaur barbarian,
raging, and using a greataxe... when you've only really got melee
attacks yourself?  Bad situation[1]).  *No* problem, as far as I was
concerned.  The minotaur was threatened by someone else, but I'd hit it
the previous round and focusing on one opponent at a time rather than
spreading the love *makes sense*.

Sucked a bit -- I liked the character and was having fun with him -- but
it would've annoyed me if I noticed the minotaur attacking someone else
for the meta purpose of not having a PC die.

[1] DM: &quot;Okay, he does a full attack on you, doing a total of 36 points
of damage.&quot;
Me: &quot;Ow.&quot;
DM: &quot;What are your hit points at?&quot;
Me: &quot;-9...&quot;
DM: &quot;Oh good, you're not dead, at least.&quot;
Me: &quot;... if he hadn't hit me for 15 last round.&quot;

What you describe above is right on the mark.

In a world where &quot;down&quot; is almost always just &quot;mostly dead&quot; instead of
&quot;all dead&quot; it's often more valuable to finish off a particularly dangerous
threat than to move on to the next still-standing opponent.  After all, it
only takes one meddlesome cleric or paladin to lay on hands and that
&quot;mostly dead&quot; opponent is back in the fight and is again a serious threat.
And it also only takes one attack to lop off the head of a fallen and
helpless opponent.

This was made *extremely* clear to me in a battle where I had pitted the
entire party against a single tough big boss in some tight spaces
undergroud.

Some background:

I have a few old friends that like to play bad guys but who don't have the
time to play DnD regularly.  So for a lot of the major confrontations
between the player party and my major bad guys, I'll invite in one of
these old friends to play &quot;a special guest villan&quot;.

It frees me up a lot to concern myself with all the flunkys and managing
the environment.  And it makes the actual encounter a lot more focused...
with a dedicated and undistracted master villan to deal with.

So my players have this Hobgoblin Barbarian Cheiftan &quot;cornered&quot; in a
cramped stairwell...  There were 3 &quot;effectives&quot; in the party and about 4
lower level followers.  The Hobgoblin was about 3 levels more advanced
than the main party members were... but lacked any allies or support at
all.

In the confined space of that stairwell, he just chewed the party and the
followers to bits... one at a time.  And by *MAKING* *SURE* that each was
dead before he moved on to the next one, he kept his job simple and
manageable.

Of course the hobgoblin died when his barbarian rage ran down and lost his
temporary hit points...  but that really was all he could ask for under
the circumstances, and he took an honor guard with him.

Once I understood it, it was a no-brainer... by finishing off each one of
his opponents irrevokably as they went down, he came out way ahead.  Once
the party realized what he was doing, they tried various things to prevent
it... like dragging the body away... and moving up to force the Hobgoblin
into a new engagement and keep him busy...  Which is exactly what the
hobgoblin wanted, close engagement in hand to hand combat.

No combatant dedicated to killing as many of their opponents as possible
should ever skip an opportunity to stab a fallen opponent that might not
be &quot;all dead&quot;.  It is a tactic sure to drive the good guys nuts and
motivate them to engage in behaviors that put them at a tactical
disadvantage that exposed them to risk in combat.  (Afterwards, of course,
the survivors should go through all the pockets and look for loose
change.)

Indeed.  IIRC I read about it in WW2 and Vietnam accounts.  Bullets are
cheap compared to (friendly) corpses, and especially your own.

&gt; What you describe above is right on the mark.

&gt; In a world where &quot;down&quot; is almost always just &quot;mostly dead&quot; instead of
&gt; &quot;all dead&quot; it's often more valuable to finish off a particularly

[snip nasty bastard fight]

I like it.  It both encourages a change in tactics (which IMO is always
a good thing because it helps keep things from getting stale) and helps
illustrate what a ruthless sumbitch the chieftain is.  Yes, he could've
stepped over the guy he just dropped (and with the right feats continued
to attack), *or* make certain.  Killing PCs in a case like this is IMO
*entirely* acceptable (from a player standpoint -- I'd *appreciate*
being killed in a fight like this, since it makes sense... even if it
does inconvenience me).

Not saying I want my PC to die or anything, just that when the tactics
make sense, it leads to a better game.  An NPC/monster who takes the
time to make sure his opponents are dead tells me the DM *isn't* pulling
his punches in the fight, either.  I don't want my hand held, I don't
want to know that I survived because the DM didn't want me to die.  I
want to be the last one standing, surveying the field of battle strewn
with the bodies of my sworn enemies and sadly-fallen companions.

Then loot them all.

Indeed, it does change how the PCs act in a fight, in a fairly credible
way.  Pulling back fallen companions, trading off positions so people
don't get *too* badly damaged before continuing to fight, and so on.  Or
getting someone to stand there and take the pounding (full defense)
while they use ranged attacks (magic and otherwise), or even just taking
the pounding while they wait for the Rage to run down (leaving him
fatigued and *much* easier to kill -- if you can last that long).

As a separate feat, or as an application of the existing Cleave feat?  I
don't think it's worth a feat itself, especially if you need Cleave as a
prereq.  It may be worth allowing as an application of the existing
Cleave, and I suspect it's about balanced.

ISTR a feat (or class ability) that makes coup de grace either a
standard action or a move-equivalent action.  Actually, IIRC there's a
feat that makes it a standard action and a class ability that makes it a
move-equivalent.  I can't cite, though.

As a DM and a player I disagree with the 'finish them off' mentality.
For the most part Clerics are very very rare in the standard D&amp;D
setting.  Most bad guys would expect to be facing a group of warriors,
not the typical adventuring party, and would fight with that in mind.
It's a lot worse to waste an attack on someone who is out of the fight
than take out (or work on doing it) another opponent.

I play my enemies this way, and they are genuinely suprised when
someone whips out the healing, and adjust their fighting style at that
point. If they have any reason to know that one of the PCs is a healer
(survived an earlier fight, had done recon etc.) then they would act
in the 'finish them off' mode to begin with.  Of course this assumes
an intelligent opponent, and them having the goal of killing off the
party.  Beasts would most likely act differently depending on the
situation - hunting - they would try to get one of the party away for
a nice quiet meal, teritorial, attack the nearest and not persue, etc.

&quot;Finish them off&quot; is most certainly an EVIL tactic.  It also makes good
tactical sense for a bad guy to do when facing good guys.  The bad guy
really only has to do it just once... and the good guys will from that
point do all sorts of dangerous things to recover and protect the bodies
of their fallen friends before they become dead.

This problem is only *enhanced* without a cleric.  If the party actually
has a cleric or other healer, that PC can move up and fix things with a
single touch...  The healing spell can even be cast from out of the
reach of the bad guy and then bestowed on the fallen comrade who's in
the enemy's reach.

If there is no healer, the heros must rush into hand-to-hand range and
try to block the enemy from finishing their comrade (most likely
standing on &quot;uneven terrain&quot; on top of them) or worse, expose themselves
to AOOs while they try to drag the body away.

This is the behavior of an intelligent and evil enemy, who is certain of
their hand to hand superiority.  If they drop the party's tank, they'd
be foolish not to do it.  The rest of the party *needs* to be lured into
dangerous hand to hand range...  where they can be cut to bits.

Taking a shot might be wasting time, and in D&amp;D, time (actions) is one
of the most precious resources.

Cornered enemies who suspect they're going to die anyway might do it out
of spite: &quot;If I'm going down, it'll cost you 25,000 gp for your friend!&quot;
But many times, if you're out to win (rather than cause the most damage
to the party), you might be better off trying to drop someone who might
kill you on their next turn rather than finishing off someone who's
alread out.

Of course, PCs face many, many people who are going to die, so the spite
thing might come up quite often... but that's why I don't use it much,
because it might come across as spite.

If anything, 'making sure' ensures the PCs *do* do that sort of thing.
Without it it seems to normally be &quot;he's either dead, in which case
there's nothing to do right now, or dying, and either we can't do
anything or he'll stabilize&quot;.  Either way, there's no cause to risk
it to go in and save him *now*.

If they know he might either go from dying to dead (inconvenient) or
dead to dismembered (more inconvenient -- /raise dead/ doesn't fix that)
then there's a greater chance they'll 'act realistically' and try to
save him.  Or would have swapped him out before he got too hurt in the
first place.

D&amp;D doesn't model 'damaged and helpless' very well, unless the creature
is unconscious or dying.  This suits the genre and is in some ways
fairly realistic, but it's inconvenient for the 'wound them so they tie
up their allies helping them' mentality.  The closest we can get is what
we've been discussing, where they *have* to save their friend before
things get worse.

&gt;&gt;&gt;My intelligent monsters and NPCs will often happily take a moment to
&gt;&gt;&gt;make sure of an enemy who's gone down, for just this reason, unless they
&gt;&gt;&gt;have more pressing concerns.

&gt;&gt; Cleave Dying:

&gt;&gt; If you deal enough damage to make a target drop, (by knocking it to 0
&gt;&gt; to -9 hitpoints), you get an automatic extra melee attack against that
&gt;&gt; target.

&gt;As a separate feat, or as an application of the existing Cleave feat?  I
&gt;don't think it's worth a feat itself, especially if you need Cleave as a
&gt;prereq.  It may be worth allowing as an application of the existing
&gt;Cleave, and I suspect it's about balanced.

Existing feat, sort of. It's a monster trait of the &quot;Abyssal Maw&quot;, from the
late and lamented Chainmail.

On the grave of Jasin Zujovic &lt;jzujo ... @inet.hr&gt; is inscribed:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Taking a shot might be wasting time, and in D&amp;D, time (actions) is one
&gt;of the most precious resources.

&gt;Cornered enemies who suspect they're going to die anyway might do it out
&gt;of spite: &quot;If I'm going down, it'll cost you 25,000 gp for your friend!&quot;
&gt;But many times, if you're out to win (rather than cause the most damage
&gt;to the party), you might be better off trying to drop someone who might
&gt;kill you on their next turn rather than finishing off someone who's
&gt;alread out.

Other in-game reasons for baddies to kill fallen foes include

* Death Knell spell gives you a positive benefit for killing him
* Vampiric Touch, though you won't get much benefit.
* Chop the head off and brandish it at the opponents for a
circumstance bonus to Intimidate
* Animate Dead
* Threatening to kill a PC allows a BBEG to escape. This is easiest if
the PC is portable (a halfling, gnome, etc)
* Souls for my lord Arioch
* Food
* If some monsters can't get at the rest of the PCs, they'll kill and
loot the body for something to do, and to get the loot before someone
else does.

D&amp;D and Star Fleet Battles stuff on http://www.axsm89.dsl.pipex.com
becaue pipex's technical support is crap and so http://www.aaargh.org doesn't work.

My point exactly. I know *I* wouldn't waste time to finish a fallen foe
unless it's really a goal of some sort, or (I know that) it has
regeneration or something.
