After hard bargaining, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice secures the continued use of an airbase we built in Kyrgyzstan and used to launch the first airstrikes against the Taliban. Earlier this year, Uzbekistan had told us to clear out of the base we built there, so I, for one, was worried about what effect that would have on our ability to continue the war in Afghanistan and the larger war on militant Islamicism (because the Uzbeks said they wouldn't share intelligence either). But Uzbekistan is small and right next to Kyrgyzstan (and Tajikistan too) so no real harm done. The Kyrgyzstan government had earlier told us to take a hike as well but Secretary Rice brought President Kurmanbek Bakiev back into the fold. Good job, Condi!
