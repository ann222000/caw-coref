Lyme Disease:
Questionable Diagnosis and Treatment
Edward McSweegan, Ph.D.

Lyme disease is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the United
States. It is most often contracted during warm-weather months. In
1999, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recorded 16,273 cases [1]. The infection is caused by Borrelia
burgdorferi, a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete) named after Willy
Burgdorfer, Ph.D., a public health researcher who identified it in
1982. The spirochete enters the skin at the site of a tick bite. After
incubating for anywhere from a few days up to a month, it migrates
through the skin and can spread to lymph nodes or disseminate through
the bloodstream to organs or distant skin sites.

Ixodes scapularis is the most common tick vector in the northeastern
and miswestern U.S. The picture shows (from left to right) the nymph,
adult male, and adult female. The spot on the thumb shows the relative
size of the nymph.

Lyme spirochetes
(Borrelia burgdorphi)

Lyme disease typically begins with a skin rash called erythema migrans
(EM), often accompanied by flu-like symptoms of fever, malaise,
fatigue, and muscle and joint pains. The characteristic skin lesion
where the bite occurs is a flat or raised red area that expands, often
with clearing at the center, to a diameter of up to 20 inches.
However, it does not always occur, which can make the diagnosis more
difficult, especially when the patient is not aware of having been
bitten by a tick. Other early signs can include small skin lesions,
facial nerve paralysis, lymphocytic meningitis, and heart-rhythm
disturbances. Early cases are usually cured by three weeks of orally
administered treatment with a common antibiotic (amoxicillin or
doxycycline). However, if untreated or inadequately treated,
neurologic, cardiac, or joint abnormalities may follow. Worldwide,
Lyme disease has probably been directly responsible for fewer than two
dozen deaths [2].

The disease is named after the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut, where
researchers recognized its nature in 1975. In Europe, associations
between tick bites and several skin diseases had been known for
decades, but it was not understood that various conditions were part
of a single illness. Since its nature was clarified, Lyme disease has
emerged as a significant source of public controversy [3]. Some people
claim to be persistently infected with B. burgdorferi and suffering
from debilitating symptoms as a result. Many infectious agents can
cause chronic infections or can be difficult to eradicate with
standard antibiotic treatments. Unfortunately, it is frequently
difficult to diagnose such infections and, in the case of Lyme
disease, it is especially difficult to know what percentage of cases
persist in the form of chronic infections. Other possibilities for
persistent symptoms include: autoimmune-like reactions in which the
body attacks its own organs and tissues, physically damaged or scarred
organs and tissues from an earlier infection, or another tick-borne
infection such as babesiosis or ehrlichiosis.

Of course, symptoms occurring long after the onset of Lyme disease can
also be coincidental. A recently published long-term study of 212
Connecticut residents suspected of having Lyme disease found that
their incidence of pain, fatigue, and difficulty with daily activities
was similar to those 212 age-matched controls without Lyme disease
[4]. As noted in an accompanying editorial:

After a median follow-up of 51 months, patients with a diagnosis
of Lyme disease that met the national surveillance case definition
developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had
the same profile of symptoms and the same quality-of-life indicators
as age-matched controls without Lyme disease. Thus, recognition and
treatment of clear-cut Lyme disease resulted in a return to baseline
with no measurable sequelae. On the other hand, patients who were
reported to have Lyme disease but who did not meet the CDC's case
definition of Lyme disease had increased symptoms and worsening
quality-of-life indicators. The implication is that many of these
individuals really did not have Lyme disease and therefore did not
respond to the treatment [5].

Limitations of Laboratory Tests

The diagnosis of Lyme disease should be based primarily on an
evaluation of the patient's symptoms and the probability of exposure
to the Lyme spirochete. Laboratory evaluation is appropriate for
patients who have the arthritic, neurologic, or cardiac symptoms
associated with Lyme disease, but it is not warranted in patients who
have nonspecific symptoms, such as those of chronic fatigue syndrome
or fibromyalgia [6]. As aptly summarized by Matthew J. Rusk, MD, and
Stephen J. Gluckman, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania:

A true-positive test result consists of a positive enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay [ELISA] or immunofluorescent assay [ILA] followed
by a positive Western blot. However, positive results do not prove
that [the] patient has Lyme disease and have little predictive value
in the absence of characteristic symptoms [7].

The FDA agrees with the above two paragraphs and has outlined a two-
step algorithm for laboratory testing [8]. In a 1997 FDA Public Health
Advisory, it advised physicians that:

The results of commonly marketed assays for detecting antibody to
Borrelia burgdorferi (anti Bb) . . . may be easily
misinterpreted. . . .

Although package inserts for some commercial assays describe their
intended use &quot;to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease,&quot; this statement
does not fully reflect current knowledge . . . and many such assays
yield potentially misleading results. . . .

Assays for anti-Bb frequently yield false-positive results because
of cross-reactive antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases or
from infection with other spirochetes, rickettsia, ehrlichia, or other
bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori [8].

One laboratory offered a one-step Lyme Antigen Urine Test [LUAT], data
for which were presented at Lyme advocacy meetings and published in
the journal of a Lyme advocacy group. However, LUAT systems return a
high rate of false-positive results and have been discredited [9].

In February 1999, the FDA approved the PreVue B. burgdorferi Antibody
Detection Assay, an &quot;in-office&quot; test that provides results within an
hour. The results are similar in accuracy to those of the ELISA test
and must be confirmed with a Western blot test done by a laboratory.
In May 2001, the FDA approved another ELISA test called C6.. Produced
by Immunetics, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is the first
diagnostic tool to use a synthetic product called C6, a hybrid marker
based on components derived from the surface of B. Burgdorferi. The C6
test is sensitive only to antibodies generated during an active
infection. Both tests should facilitate accurate diagnosis and reduce
the number of chronic or problematic cases through early antibiotic
treatment.

Some practitioners are inappropropriately diagnosing Lyme disease in
many of the patients who consult them and are administering one or
more of the inappropriate treatments described below.

Malariotherapy and ICHT

Malaria is a parasitic disease that typically involves bouts of fever
reaching 40째C to 41째C (104째F to 106째F). Before the antibiotic era,
patients in the late stages of syphilis were sometimes given malaria
with the hope that the fever would kill the spirochetes responsible
for the syphilis. The practice was never subjected to controlled
studies and was abandoned decades ago when antibiotics became widely
available. In recent years, many Lyme patients have allowed themselves
to be injected with blood containing a malaria parasite, Plasmodium
vivax [10]. Persons seeking such treatments usually had to travel to
Mexico. However, in one case, a Texas resident acquired P. vivax-
contaminated blood from an unknown source, injected himself, then
treated himself with the antimalarial drug chloroquine [11]. There is
no evidence that malaria infection cures Lyme disease (or any other
disease for that matter). Moreover, patients who receive malaria-
containing blood face significant risks of serious illness or death
caused by the malaria itself, a transfusion reaction, or an infection
by other pathogens that might be in the blood. All things considered,
malariotherapy is far more dangerous than Lyme disease.

Another form of fever therapy administered to patients alleged to have
chronic Lyme disease is &quot;intracellular hyperthermia therapy (ICHT),&quot;
in which a substance such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is administered.
According to a proponent Web site:

The net result of ICHT uncoupler therapy causes the mitochondria
to be converted from efficient &quot;powerhouses&quot; of energy production to
&quot;chemical furnaces&quot;, heating cells from the &quot;inside-out.&quot; The Lyme
spirochetes are subjected to such an amount of heat over a prescribed
time that they cannot survive. In essence, ICHT maybe considered a
form of therapeutic &quot;pasteurization.&quot;

Unfortunately, DNP is a metabolic poison that can result in severe
weight loss and even death [12].
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)

High-pressure (hyperbaric) oxygen is legitimately used to treat deep
sea divers suffering from decompression sickness (&quot;the bends&quot;) and
smoke inhalation, and to help treat several other conditions [13].
There are 300 hyperbaric facilities in the United States. Some of
these facilities have been used to treat AIDS, chronic fatigue
syndrome, and Lyme disease. The Lyme patients subjecting themselves to
long hours in these small chambers apparently hope that high-pressure
oxygen will enhance oxygen-dependent immune mechanisms and kill
spirochetes lurking beyond the reach of antibiotics.

Is HBOT effective against Lyme disease? At far as I know, it has not
been subjected to clinical testing for that purpose. One Lyme patient
who reported on
