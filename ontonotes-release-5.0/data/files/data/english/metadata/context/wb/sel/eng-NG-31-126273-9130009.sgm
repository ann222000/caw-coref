Come on travis, I dont buy that. Computer scientists know how to
design algorithms: they determine what is the best possible type of
solution (for example, order N or logN, or something that can be
compared to other, better or worse, algorithms) for a given problem,
based on the number and types of operations required, and the relative
expense of these. Perhaps there may be overlap between your
meaning---the best possible solution may be something you call &quot;brute
force&quot;---but it is certainly not the same as putting no thought into

understanding, eradication of mistaken beliefs, and examination of new

Interesting question. The machine hold the experience and knowledge of
a whole civilization, whereas possibly not a single one of the people
who contributed to it would be able to beat Kasparov at his
speciality. The fact that humans can combine their knowledge to build
incredible machines for specific tasks is amazing---the machine itself
is not intelligent at all, nor smart. Chess is simply deterministic
given the available board size and the power of machines today. I
wonder whether the rules of anotehr board game such as Go are as (or
more) simple to code for a computer? Often smart is not finding a new
way to do something but simply avoiding making an error first.

Not true.  The search space is still too big to solve completely.

It just happens that a very fast computer, using heuristic search, can
perform as well as the best humans.

But by no means does that computer play a &quot;perfect&quot; game of chess.

Go has a much larger search space than chess, so the (in general) &quot;brute
force&quot; computer solution that was so effective in chess is much less so in
Go.

People, of course, don't solve chess using the same kind of algorithms as
computers to.  For people, chess and Go are of roughly equal difficulty.
For computers, Go is _much_ harder.

Until there's a complete solution, it can never play perfectly. But
more to the point, the evalution functions are defined by humans, so
it's limited to top-end human level.

An even bigger problem is the definition of an evaluation function.
Chess has well-defined functions (number of pawns, possession of
queen, etc) such that looking at a board position ten moves in the
future a computer can assess a good, promising position. Go has a much
more complicated board state, as you can invest in moves that are
useful in very (algorithmically) ill-defined and unspecific ways.

Well, you do know that Checkers has been solved, yes?

Triumph of brute force.  So long as the computer plays first, it will
win every time, and apparently can play every other game to at least a
draw.  It cannot be defeated.  If you make one deviation, you lose,
invariably.

I remember the news blurb...it happened this year.  Chess is only a
matter of time.

Crikey, one of those standard red house has the guy that smokes the

I really did not want to delve into either brute force or myself.  It
was merely a demonstration of how performance on a test can arbitrate
intelligence or cognitive capability in a particular application.

I was smarter than these guys at lots of other things too...I don't
base anything on the results of one puzzle.

I think you underestimate the implications of Moore's Law.  Mark my
words...a lot of the conceits humans have had, the uncontested
supremacy in cognition, are going to be rudely disabused within the
next 10 years.

If we were really *interested* in putting Moore's on roids, say
decreasing the 3dB to 14 months or something, it'd be even more
profound.  With the advent of synthetic diamonds and the recent
successes in n-type doping or was it p-, there is that possibility.
We've been bumping up against the limitations of silicon now for
around a decade, heat dissipation, etc.  If a quantum leap were made
to occur thru technical initiatives by a government not related to war

Depends on how you define smartness.
The whole IQ test is an utter delusion because it takes
into consideration the whiteman's obscessions.

Intelligence is much vaster than and &quot;test&quot; can measure.
Those things you think are significant, are utterly insignificant
in a different setting, be it envoronment, tradition or interest
of a given individual.

Would you say that IQ of the person, who travelled around the
globe by boat or every way imaginable, is less then of those,

Perhaps :-) You're optimistic! I'm cynical: most humans are lazy
shits, and so by the time computers get ramped up to 6 order times the
power they have now, most humans might not be able to solve the
problems we routinely solve now---all owing to the oh-so helpful
&quot;service&quot; for which we pay loads of money (sorry, rant, it really
upsets me to see how companies try to make people helpless and refuse
to let them help themselves).

The main reason I am still thinking that humans have the higher
ability is not because computers are getting more powerful---that is
something I am delighted about too---but because humans don't
understand very well yet how humans function. Little bits and pieces
of understanding have already made a huge impact in treatment of
psychological disorders, but I'm afraid I don't see any major
breakthroughs in the area of human thought coming soon without some
more serious breakthroughs in physiology first. (see below)

:-) Kudos to Iosef... My point is that the current implementations of
how machines &quot;think&quot; is to a large degree brute force, that is what
they were designed for (when you think of the original reasons for the
development of the Bombes, for instance). And machines will, as you
say, improve their raw power. But that still doesn't include a whole
range of problems for which humans still have an advantage---because
no-one has yet been able to quantify how it works. Let's face it, alll
the &quot;problems&quot; that are put in tests are fairly simple, deterministic
ones. Non-deterministic ones take the form of essays with pro and
contra, followed by conclusions and a form of reasoning which is
supposed to be logical in form, but whose content cannot be so easily
quantified. And that's why marking those kind of tests is so hard to
do, subjective. And note that nations who foster industry completely
exclude such tests from their education curriculum---I have taught
teachers at Japanese schools for years now (english and german), and
virtually of their students had ever done a test that did not have a
&quot;correct&quot; answer that could be filled in. Same with history studies
and a whole lot more---what you seem to take for granted in the West
doesn't exist in a large part of the rest of the world. I'd hazard a
guess that the power of computers is more in line with Asian learning
but far less in line with the kind of thinking Westerners (used to!)
develop.

Anyhow, you play chess?  Try this logic puzzle:

Imagine a chess variant, where every piece
moves (or captures) only to the same
color square; call it monochrome chess.
The initial position is the same as
regular chess.  i.e. no piece ever moves
away from its initial color.

You visit the Monochrome Chess Club,

Your puzzle is interesting, but as for most such puzzles, unless you
know the point of the question, and which &quot;assumptions&quot; you can let go
of in order to view the puzzle without confusing and misleading
&quot;underlying mis-information&quot;, it is pretty pointless and boring. If it
is a mere trick, as in &quot;...electric train...heading bearing X, wind
blowing from Y....blah....blah....which way does the smoke go?&quot; then
it is boring. If there is a pattern method that can be traced out a la
algorithm, then it is interesting. For me, knowing how to solve a
problem is more important than solving it in a fixed time: once the
method is known it can be applied to a general class of problems once
recognized as such. Only the initial one is hard.

So, while my 10 minutes might be up, let me ask some questions:

a. you say it is not a chess problem, but you don't say what can be
forgone from the rules. Do pieces have to move straight, or can
they move diagonally. Otherwise, there would be no start, since
pawns cannot move diagonally unless capturing pieces, and no other
piece can move out from behind them (given that the knight is
castrated by the monochrome rule).

b. given that you said logic rather than chess, is there an object
towards which the players aim which is different from normal chess?

c. I haven't had time to look at a non-deformed representation of your
board layout, but is this a special case (i.e. only one way to get
there), or can any number of situations be posed?

A tip: for usenet and email, the standard is plain text, which we all
know. Furthermore, most clients can display using monospaced
text. This is the best type of text to ensure alignment: think of it
as grid layout. From what I get, it looks like you had proportional
fonts in your client, and were trying to align columns in that. It
doesn't work. Use monospaced font instead (same for ASCII graphics,
for example).

Cheers, Gernot

Obviously knights don't move, but may be captured.  Pawns can make

I don't know where the Bishop belongs, but I've got a feeling that if
I knew how the White Knight disappeared it might be helpful. No white-
squared Black pawn has moved, the white-squared Black rook can only
access even-numbered ranks, and the other white-squared Black pieces
are either confined (bishop,king) or paralysed(knight) .Who killed the
Knight?????

The white one.  Black has no white pieces out of original position
(from which they could not have moved) that could have captured the
white bishop other than the queen's rook.  The only piece black
deployed that could capture the white bishop therefore is the queen's
rook.  Black's white rook (queen's rook) is not on the board.  Neither
is white's queen.  Black's queen's rook could only be captured by a
white square piece and none are in position to have done so while
themselves remaining on the board (white has all black square pieces
and a nondeployed king's rook) other than white's queen, which is not
on the board, or white's kingside bishop.  Therefore, the only piece
on the board that could have captured the black king's rook and itself
have remained on the board would have been the king's bishop.

Unfortunately, tho, I sense a flaw in the game setup.  There is no
piece black could have used to capture white's queen's knight under
the rules you provided as this piece cannot move, and cannot be
captured by a rook, and, as black has all its white square pawns still
on the board, there is no possibility that it advanced one and
promoted it to a queen or rook on a white square capable of capturing
this knight.  Black has deployed no whitesquare pieces except the rook
and this piece is incapable under the rules of having captured white's
queen's knight.  Consequently, I think the club is full of cheaters
and given that white is prone to cheating, I am thinking he probably
slid the bishop to black b/c he was following the &quot;Wesley Snipes
Rule.&quot;

It took me about as long to type this as to solve it.  Certainly, I am
prone to some error here because the board you typed was fkin crooked.

An addendum:  certainly, black, had its whitesquare pawns not all been
in original position, could possibly have advanced one and promoted it
to a bishop capable of attacking white's queen's knight, although this
would require more captures than white has whitesquare pieces off the
board.  While theoretically possible, it is not the case given the
board position.

Also, when I said that white's queen's knight could not be captured by
a rook, I meant a rook original to the board.  It could only be
captured by a rook caused on the last rank via promotion of a
whitesquared pawn.  This position could only be achieved via an
initial move and then a sequence of 4 diagonal captures.  Each side
posseses only 3 movable pieces capable of supporting such an outcome,
with the knight being the 4th.  But, again, black has moved no
whitesquare pawns and white still has its king's rook, therefore this
is, as said, an impossibility given the stated board position.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The initial position is the same as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular chess.  i.e. no piece ever moves

&gt; &gt; &gt; How the hell do the knights move?

&gt; &gt; They don't travel far in monochrome chess.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do pawns move 2 spaces every time?

&gt; &gt; No, they move as per the standard rules, except
&gt; &gt; for the color restriction.

&gt; The white one.  Black has no white pieces out of original
&gt; position (from which they could not have moved) that
&gt; could have captured the white bishop other than the
&gt; queen's rook.  The only piece black deployed that
&gt; could capture the white bishop therefore is the queen's
&gt; rook.  Black's white rook (queen's rook) is not on the
&gt; board.  Neither is white's queen.  Black's queen's
&gt; rook could only be captured by a white square piece
&gt; and none are in position to have done so while
&gt; themselves remaining on the board (white has all black
&gt; square pieces and a nondeployed king's rook) other
&gt; than white's queen, which is not on the board, or
&gt; white's kingside bishop.  Therefore, the only piece
&gt; on the board that could have captured the black king's
&gt; rook and itself have remained on the board would have
&gt; been the king's bishop.

Yes, it has to be on a white square, i.e. d3

Your reasoning is essentially correct, though
somewhat redundant.  It doesn't matter much
who captured which or when, what matters is
there must be a white square piece somewhere!
If the bishop is on e3, what was the last capture
on a white square?

This is the insight which solves the problem,
and it isn't gained through brute force, but
smarts... the motivation behind this example.

I expected to offer some hints at the solution,
but no need...

There's a slew of similar problems, like
&quot;there is a knight on a4, is it black or
white?&quot;... though I can't recall any particular.

Unfortunately, you're right...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is no piece black could have used to capture
&gt; white's queen's knight under the rules you provided
&gt; as this piece cannot move, and cannot be captured
&gt; by a rook, and, as black has all its white square pawns still
&gt; on the board, there is no possibility that it advanced one and
&gt; promoted it to a queen or rook on a white square
&gt; capable of capturing this knight.  Black has deployed
&gt; no white square pieces except the rook
&gt; and this piece is incapable under the rules of having
&gt; captured white's queen's knight.

yep, I blew it.

I ginned up this position from memory, and knew
there was a chance of a constructing an illegal
position.  Even aware of the possibility, I still phuked up!

Well, I wanted to move as pedagogically as possible so that people
would follow my explanation.  In essence, there are only 3 white
pieces that could have captured the black queen's rook:  a whitesquare
pawn, white's queen, or white's king's bishop (barring the promoted
pawn example I referenced earlier).  In doing so, it had to, itself,
still be on the board.  2 of the 3 weren't; a bishop remained.

I am unclear as to what your motivation was for giving me yet another
example to demonstrate my exceptional intelligence.  I am not and was
not talking shit.

You shouldn't be so smug.  I am as advertised.

You may very well have needed to do so with the others.  Literally,
once I had the basic rules of the problem, it took less than 5
minutes.  Given a properly coded rules of monochrome chess, I am
confident that a computer could have solved it monte carlo in less.
However, such an approach was unnecessary given application of logic.

Of course I am.

You will note that it did not escape my observation.

&gt;&gt; Your puzzle is interesting, but as for most such puzzles,
&gt;&gt; unless you know the point of the question, and which
&gt;&gt; &quot;assumptions&quot; you can let go of in order to view the
&gt;&gt; puzzle without confusing and misleading
&gt;&gt; &quot;underlying mis-information&quot;, it is pretty pointless and boring.

&gt; No assumptions, no hidden information, take
&gt; it at face value.

&gt;&gt;For me, knowing how to solve a problem is more
&gt;&gt;important than solving it in a fixed time: once the method
&gt;&gt;is known it can be applied to a general class of
&gt;&gt;problems once recognized as such. Only the initial one is hard.

&gt; That is a good way to think.

&gt;&gt; a. you say it is not a chess problem, but you don't say what
&gt;&gt; can be forgone from the rules. Do pieces have to move
&gt;&gt; straight, or can they move diagonally. Otherwise, there
&gt;&gt; would be no start, since pawns cannot move diagonally
&gt;&gt; unless capturing pieces, and no other
&gt;&gt; piece can move out from behind them (given that the knight is
&gt;&gt; castrated by the monochrome rule).

&gt; A pawn can move two spaces its initial move.

Heh, I forgot a basic rule of chess :-) OK, mystery gone. I think I
can continue on my own LOL

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The position is legal, and reachable from the start.

&gt;&gt; b. given that you said logic rather than chess, is
&gt;&gt; there an object towards which the players aim which
&gt;&gt; is different from normal chess?

&gt; Don't go Freudian, Gernot.  The object is checkmate,
&gt; but it doesn't matter.  It's logic problem - show
&gt; that the bishop must be on d3 (or e3); or, show
&gt; it cannot be on d3 (or e3).

No problem. Will look into it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; c. I haven't had time to look at a non-deformed
&gt;&gt;  representation of your board layout, but is this
&gt;&gt;  a special case (i.e. only one way to get
&gt;&gt;  there), or can any number of situations be posed?

&gt; That would be too much of a giveaway...

OK, that's getting to the fun bit now! Just back from 3 days vacation,
will have time tomorrow after work.
