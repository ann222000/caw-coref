I hear this commercial on the radio all the time for an alarm system,
and in it, they claim that one of the most important reasons for
owning one is so that you don't walk in on a a dangerous intruder upon
returning home.

In another book I read (the book of inside information), it says that
if you walk in on an intruder, you should play dumb and say "Oh.. you
must be the painter I'm glad they left the door open for you" - it
goes on to say that you should be careful not to block the intruder's
way out.

Now I'm going to be honest with you, I really look up to you guys
here. In my opinion, you guys are probably some of the deadliest
fighters around. Would you guys subscribe to the above attitudes?

It depends. This *might* work with an experienced break &amp; enter guy who will just
smile and walk by.

Problem is, if he's an inexperienced guy and full of adrenaline, his main concern
will be putting you out of action so you can't identify him later.

Walking in on an intruder is a very risky deal. Does he have a gun? If he does
(and it might be worth assuming he does) then you need to get away as quickly as
possible...jump the fence, run to the nearest neighbour, just remove yourself
from a potentially fatal situation.

If you're feeling lucky/brave/foolish and have a weapon of your own that you are
skilled in using, you *might* want to confront him if you figure he is unarmed.

No easy answer to this one.

In this neighborhood if you do not have an alarmn system you will be
burglarized. House after house has been hit here. It is undoubtedly some of
those " poor souls" who left New Orleans after Katrina. More and more houses
are having alarmn systems installed and we have not yet experienced home
invasions as New Orleans has. A prominent physicians wife was murdered in
front of him and his kids by the scum there. ( New Orleans now has four
times the national murder rate). Home invasions occur while you are home.
Your guard is down and your alarmn is off. Dont let your guard down.
In response to your question: when my alarmn goes off I respond to it by
coming back to my house. The intruder better hope he is deadly. However,
when the cops get there ( usually way after I do), it is their show so back
off.

If it goes off and he's not deaf and/or stupid he will probably bolt. I think we

off, or are we walking into the house with no alarm going and stumble across the
intruder? In either scenario, are you armed with a gun or not?

Just one for the intruder. Run. I will not shoot him in the back. The real
question goes to the core of the problem. That is too few people are capable
of taking care of themselves and learn how to do it. So they stand
helplessly by and allow the intruder to rob them, maim them, kill them. See
my answer above. Then they whine about the authorities not protecting them.
Sorry, I  people have tried to extort me in the past. Did not work. Look at
history. Those that fight do not get run over. 6 million marched easily into
ovens at one time etc etc. I dont march anywhere. Reason I am old.

Yes and that is their problem. If you look around, and you will not have to
look far,  their enemies are armed with a gun. That makes them, to their
shock, victims. It is not so much that they are not armed. They are simply
unwilling to arm themselves and/or fight back.

Quite right.  I don't walk around armed.  Nevertheless, my attitude is that

better leave in a big hurry.  They will not be faced with a happy bunny.

If you walk in on someone in your house and you don't know they're
there, they're in all likelihood probably going to ambush you.  At
least the ppl we have around here are more the home invasion type and
they will come prepared or else acquire a weapon from your knife
drawer.  They'll hear you opening the garage door or walking in, and
unless there are clear signs of forced entry,  you're kinda swimming
upstream.

That said, if you are armed and encounter an intruder, order them to
get down on the floor immediately.  If they do not comply within the
time it takes you to redraw your breath, shoot them.

Pull whatever else you're carrying as a weapon-
Unless you've been walking in the nude, you must have a little
somthin'somthin', right?
And, when I step through the door, there're going to be a half-dozen weapons
available- the ones I leave there for when I answer the door looking out.
The first time I surprised a burglar, he was a kid, and I let him go without
a beating. Didn't know he had a pocketful of jewelry- youthful naiveté` and
kindness for him.
The next time, they were in my studio front room of the place- I beat them
up with a tooling maul and let them run away.
The last time, I heard some commotion and went through the kitchen- picked
up a french-knife on the way. They had pistols, but they hadn't pulled them
before I got too close for them to escape getting cut. The police sorted
that one out.
Mostly, I just go to work on them- let them explain it while their mouth
hurts.

In that situation, if the person shows a clear reluctance to comply, I think
I'd put a bullet in him, as I considered what to do with boogey-man behind
me.  He wouldn't be stalling for time, in the hope that something good will

Fraser's right, the best anti Intruder devise is a huge dog.
Even a small dog barking with makes an intruder thick twice about
breaking in.

In the past, I used to have large working class dogs (Great Dane,
Dobies, Rotties) and that does make intruders think twice. They want
an easy in/out scene and usually go on to the next targeted home.
Funny story....for almost 20 yrs I had anywhere from 5 to 100 venomous
snakes (I married into this particular lifestyle of a zookeeper). We
lived in one of the roughest parts of town on what I used to think was
the last secluded 5 acres in the city limits. Our neighbor at the foot
of our very long driveway was broken into 3 times in less than 6 wks.
First two times, perps stole every firearm the poor guy had. The last
time, he just upped and moved. During this time period, we noticed
someone had tried to jimmy our front door lock, then our back door
lock but no entry was ever made. We deduced it had to be the fact that
every single room in our house had cages and aquariums w/ all kinds of
snakes. I just wish we had a hidden video camera.....it would've made
for a great home movie :-)

Really? I kept telling my neighbor to get an alarm system. The reply was
that four big dogs in the back yard would scare the burglars away. Three
weeks ago they kicked in his side door ( the dogs were in the backyard not
the house) and took the tv, jewelry, computers and everything that was
easily movable and not nailed down. He now has an alarm system. They skipped
me. I have a monitored alarm system and no dogs.
Unfortunately, I was away that day. If home I would have probably checked
out the racket. However, those dogs will bark at possums and raccoons that
wander thru to. So sometimes they get ignored.
Both is better.

Dogs can be quite easily poisoned as well, it happens pretty

A friend of mine told me of how on coming home to his property in
country NSW he found a burglar trapped on a downstairs windowsill by
his two German Shepherds.
Every time the intruder moved the dogs would growl menacingly at him,
apparently he'd been there from 2 hours.

Apparently said buglar had no weapon. If he had, your friend would have
found two dead German Shepards and a burglarized house.

if  there is alarm, dont go inside. call the police emmediately form a
secure location where you can see as much as posible the exit of the
invidual/s. so you can guide police with details if they go out and
pass by you. but try to be as descreet as possible. if there is no way
to look at the house and be safe then just go someplace safe and call
the police.

if you happen to see individual in your house,  try to be descreet
again, if you cannot avoid contact, keep distance, try saying "your
tonys friend yes? or "ohh good, your here, the leak is over there",
point and go the other direction mumbling some thing why you need to
go out the house.. and keep distance. go out and go to a safer place
the better. say something like, "o shit i forgot my car key" then call
the police. even if you have a gun if you are not willing to shoot the
person emmediately, dont even use it. Always take control of the
situation. that way you can do the best decision.

by all means try to get out and find safer place. if you cannot go
out, make way to kitchen for knife or go to any weapon you can grab if
he decide to confront you. if he is not willing to fight, by now, hell
find a way to go out your sight. either way, lock yourself to bedroom
or bath and call police by cel phone or land line if still ok. Fight
only if you see that fight is inevitable. if fight is inevitable start
the attack, dont let him start it. be as ferocious as you can, use
best weapon you can manage to get and kill him if you can as fast as
possible.

better yet, have neighborhood watch. have signal pre arranged device
like red towel on window means you need help/police so when neighbor
see, even if you cannot call police help is coming.

always strenght in numbers.

every year, dozens of policemen, even swat members, going on in as a
team in force protectected by vests, shields, helmet and the the law
gets killed trying to control criminals. what makes you think you
alone can do a better job?

its not worth it to put yourself in danger when there is another way
to resolve things.

fighting is always the last resort. only when you have to, only when
there is no other way. and when you do fight, fight to eliminate the
threath as fast as posible. the longer the war, the more you will have
to pay for it.
