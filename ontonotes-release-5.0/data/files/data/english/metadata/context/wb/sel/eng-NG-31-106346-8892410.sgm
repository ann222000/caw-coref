At the risk of looking like spam...
I have no connection with this site, but I like it
because it saves me money and it flips a finger at
the grubby cellphone companies that try to rake in
extra cash by forcing you to buy what should be free.

See, I got frustrated because the LG Fusic phone I got
with my Sprint plan didn't have the capability to allow
me to load mp3 ringers from my computer.  Instead they wanted me
to buy ringers and download them.  That's just plain wrong.

So I eventally found this site:

http://www.funformobile.com/pages/ringtone/uploadRingtone.php

What you do is create an MP3 ring tone, or use a popular
song in mp3 format.  You goto  this site and and upload
it.  Then you get a text message on your phone with a
special URL that you open to download the ringer into your
phone.  Completely bypassing the need to buy ringtones from
Sprint or others.

It also works for screen savers and wakllpaper too.

Of course you have to give them your phone number and the the contact
info is limited to a form that you send to them.

Even more likely that was a spam...since the newer phones let you
transfer MP3's in to use as ring tones, anyway...no website or special
software needed.  I had mine set to play the Beatles &quot;Good morning,
good morning&quot; (just the rooster crowing part and beginning riff of
course).

I have my phone set for whatever ring sounds the most like a standard

phone. Amazing how few people use that type of ring.

I expect they don't....it's even more amazing how many have the
default Nokia or Motorola ring...and then multiple people go for the
phone when it goes off in a store...heheh.

It's an LG Fusic, Wireless provider is sprint.  Service is new
as of June.  I would say that qualifies as a newer phone.
Check out some of the chatter on line about this phone.  There
is general anger at sprint for locking out the ability to
download custom mp3 ringers.

Yes it has a USB cable and I can transfer mp3's into the phone,
because the phone is also a music player.  But I can't use
the downloaded mp3s as ringers.  The ringers are actually
held in a hidden folder in the phone.  I can access the folder
using Bitpim, but I can't add content to it. Bitpim indicates
that the folder is locked and it can't do a thing about it.
There also is a workaround that uses Bitpim to replace a ringer
that is already in the folder.  Now that we established that...

I did probe the web site.  YOu do have to give your phone number
so that you can receive the text message that allows you to
actually download the ringer.  But I pulled the PHP code and
the javascript and examined them.  THere doesn't apear to be
any code in there that saves your information.

But if you are paranoid, don't use it.

Unfortunatly this phone has only about 12 default ringers and none
of them sound like a landline.  In fact, half of them sound like
doorbells.

I have a ringer that sounds like a train at a railroad crossing.
But my wife wouldn't let me use it.

That's also my problem.   I'd much prefer a simple &quot;land line&quot; ring, but
it's not one that's offered.

It's not that hard if you are not carefull. Esp with one of these
newer phones that are web enabled. I clicked on an ad for &quot;free
ringtones&quot;  Then I was about to click on another link when I read the
fine print.  It said somthing like &quot;By clicking this link you agree to
be billed $9.95 each month on your wireless bill until you figure
out how to unsubscribe from our service&quot;
