Hi All!
I bought this cute little table a while back just because I liked it.
It's value doesn't matter to me, because I don't intend to sell it. It
looks great in my entryway, and I really enjoy having it. But I'd like
to know a little more about it. I'm pretty good at identifying glassware
(not the good stuff Reyne carries - the lower end stuff) but I don't
know a thing about furniture. So hopefully a few of you can help educate
me. If anyone can tell me some of the really basic things like if this
style has a name and what the table's original use might have been, I'd
really appreciate it! Any guesses on age would be welcome as well.

Here's a picture:
http://www.shop4antiques.com/graphics/table.jpg
The table is 28&quot; tall. It has a 14&quot; X 25&quot; oval top. The gal I bought it
from said it is a candlestand since the top is relatively small. The top
is on a hinge-type mechanism so it can be tipped vertical for easier
storage. I haven't a clue what kind of wood it is and I don't know how
to tell. It's a nice medium brown, not quite a red as the photo, with an
even grain that kind of reminds me of tiger stripes.

Thanks!
Mandi

"/> Hi Mandi, long time, no hear ;~)) your table looks to me to be a Federal

"/> Your table, in English terms, would appear to *indicate* a late
Georgian or Regency style, say around c1800-30 - in the neoclassical
style. We on this side of the pond would call this type of table a
&quot;candlestand&quot; or more strictly, and simply, a tripod table. By this
late date they had lost their original function as solely a stand for
a candle or candlestick, and therefore served many other functions as
well, as a wine table for example.

However, an oval top is not what we on this side of the pond would
expect to see with this style and date of table. I would caution, that
these tables are quite commonly made-up or from a marriage and of
course, widely reproduced all throughout the 19th century and into the
early 20th century, and still today, continue to be produced. Whatever
the wood, this table construction demanded a strong, close-grained
timber which would not easily split, and which could be cut in a
single piece for the table top. In England the first choice of timber
for such a table was always mahogany, and of fine sturdy
craftsmanship.

Mandi, really a must, can you provide a good set of pictures of the
underside of the table top itself, the support parallel cross bearers
and the brass spring catch mechanism? .. should help a great deal.

Enclosing, your table is probably (highly likely) American, but other
than the choice of timber there wasn't really all that much difference
between an English version and an American version. The only other
remark, your table looks a bit on the delicate side. I would be keen
to read an American opinion on the table, fingers crossed. :)

"/> Hi Mike,
That sounds yummy! I was hoping for at least circa 1900, so you've
really made my day! I've become quite attached to this little guy, so
you'll probably have to settle for looking at the picture for now. :)
It's interesting how a particular item will speak to you even when you
haven't a clue what it is. I just love the simple, graceful lines.
Thanks so much Mike!

"/> Mandy, it's possible that the top could be a replacement, Figured maple
is a rather unstable wood and tends to twist and check, most of these
tables with solid figured maple tops I have come across have have
cracked or warped.

Actually now would be a good time to talk about tool marks as an aid to
identification on pieces like this one, here's a short list of what I
look for.

1. Measure the thickness of all lumber used, wood used on pieces of this
age would have been hand planed and there would be slight variations in
the measurement along the length of a board.

2.Check the pedestal shaft, it should be more egg shaped than round in
diameter. Also check for lathe tool marks on the shaft, the old lathes
turned at much lower speeds and left small grooves like on a record
(remember them;~)

3.Check the base of the shaft , the legs should be attached with sliding
dovetails rather than dowel pins, quite often these tables would have
had a metal brace to keep the legs from splaying.

4.Remove all the screws, screws of this period were blunt, rough looking
affairs, often with the slot cut off centre.

5.Look at the underside of the legs and top for tool marks, lay a ruler
on edge across the grain and look for scallop like marks running with
the grain, figured maples are very hard to plane by hand and it is
almost impossible to do it without leaving some tear out in the grain.
Power planes leave tiny scallop marks running across the grain ( every
1/8 to 1/4&quot;) and leave the board an even thickness.

There are other numerous things to check, but this should get you
started Mandi ;~))

Mandi,
This is a really nice piece! It looks like a spider-legged tilt-top
candlestand or tea table (because of dimensions of the top) from the New
England area. When I was in Maine last year I saw one quite similar and very
pricey. I'll be going now to read the other posts to find out how wrong I
probably am...lol It looks at first site like 19th century...okay ,I'm
really going now to read what the other ,know much more than me, members
said.

&gt;Hi Ronnie,

&gt;right, but that's probably a minor concern. There is one thing about
&gt;this table that I thought was odd from the beginning. The top is made of
&gt;two pieces of wood. Perhaps the table top is a not original.

"/> Yeah, as I said, normally the top is made from one piece of wood, no
joint. However, as Mike has suggested this may be &quot;Tiger&quot; maple, that
could account for the two pieces making up the top, certainly with the
likes of a fruitwood and yew woods tops these were often of more than
one piece owing to the lack of girth of the trees. I am not familiar
with &quot;Tiger&quot; maple so I can't say for sure if &quot;Tiger&quot; maple also
lacked the girth to allow for a single one piece top. Whatever, but
even when and if two pieces were needed for the top, these would have
been matched, both in width and in grain. Looking at the pictures
there appears to have been no attempt at all to match these two pieces
of wood, either in equal width and certainly no grain matching. That
would worry the hell out of me.

The method by which the top is mounted onto the base stem, is also a
worry and all wrong if this were an English table, but again, this may
be an American characteristic, although, I would doubt this very much,
because the work/construction on underside of this table is so bloody
crude. Also, on an English version, special attention would have been
given to the catch mechanism itself. Brass would be the order of the
day on an English table, again, on this table, the mechanism is rather
crude, almost being crude for crude's sake, deliberately, IMO to give
a false impression of age. A crude, almost handmade looking catch
implying .. &quot;hey this has got to be right, look at this old catch&quot;
when in fact it doesn't look right at all. That catch is something
like one would find on a garden gate, if it is original, then the guy
that made this table needs a good kick up the ass ... IMO.

The method by which the cross parallel bearers (stretchers) have been
attached to the table top, dear god!! .. big ugly screws!! and only
*two* per cross bearer!!??!! and attached at the extreme ends only!!
.. a big NO NO for me I'm afraid. No attention to detail at all. On
an English table these screws would be well counter-sunk and then
plugged up and carefully finished with a wooden dowel, and more screws
than merely two per cross bearer. The bearers themselves would have
been nicely finished, all the sharp edges taken off and rounded and
not polished. They appear to be polished in the picture?? .. the
underside of the table also appears to have some sort of finish on it?

Mandi, I am not being negative for the sake of it. IMHO there just
isn't the quality and the craftsmanship for a table of this ilk, and
the craftsman, even a country craftsman, would have paid more
attention to the underside of this table.

My opinion, FWIW, the top either doesn't belong to the pod, or the top
has been heavily work at, or the top is simply a completely made-up
piece. If that is so the the pod itself would come under suspicion.

It's a real pity, because in the first (original) picture of the table
it really looked the biz, but now having viewed the underside and the
general construction all I can say, I hope you paid that &quot;gal&quot; by
credit card or at least by cheque and it was hopefully only a matter
of a couple of days ago, you can draw your own conclusions from that
remark.

Others may have a totally different opinion. Once again Mandi, I am
sorry if you feel I am being unduly harsh with my opinion, but it's
just an opinion. ;)

Holy Cow!!!! Ronnie!! Relax!!!!
I was simply making a bit of light banter.
Sheesh...
If you really care, the fact is i learned a lot from your post. I went
back, looked at the pictures, and tried to see what you were describing.
I was even going to thank you for the insightful analysis, but i figured
everytime i made the most benign comment, several people here make it a
sport of jumping down my throat. So i refrained.
Guess i should have also refrained from saying anything at all.

Tis indeed a pity that this group is so defensive, and ready to read
into things the wrong way. Especially since a lot of people here have a
lot of knowledge to offer.

Well that's it for me folks. I've had enough of this. I'm going to spend
my time reading the antique publications and going to shows. No point in
trying to participate in discussions when people are so hostile.

So long, good luck, god bless.

"/> Actually, *I* have been reserving my comments until after Mandi tells us how
the legs are attached. As Mike said, they should be dovetailed in, not
dowelled. I would have called it a candlestick table or tripod table (Same as
Ronald). The first picture was delightful. The top bothers me, though, once
tilted up for a better look.
These tables are sometimes called &quot;snap&quot; tables because of that latch in
the back (at least that's what my books say, I've never used that term,
myself). I didn't thing the catch looked as incorrect and primitive as Ronnie
did (maybe it is an American vs European difference).
Miriam, I think Ronnie was just waiting and hoping for some constructive
insights from the U.S. I doubt anyone was wanting for you to leave.

&gt;&gt;Hi Ronnie,
&gt;&gt;Here are a couple more pictures. I still can't get the color of the wood
&gt;&gt;right, but that's probably a minor concern. There is one thing about
&gt;&gt;this table that I thought was odd from the beginning. The top is made of
&gt;&gt;two pieces of wood. Perhaps the table top is a not original.

&gt; Yeah, as I said, normally the top is made from one piece of wood, no
&gt; joint. However, as Mike has suggested this may be &quot;Tiger&quot; maple, that
&gt; could account for the two pieces making up the top, certainly with the
&gt; likes of a fruitwood and yew woods tops these were often of more than
&gt; one piece owing to the lack of girth of the trees. I am not familiar
&gt; with &quot;Tiger&quot; maple so I can't say for sure if &quot;Tiger&quot; maple also
&gt; lacked the girth to allow for a single one piece top. Whatever, but
&gt; even when and if two pieces were needed for the top, these would have
&gt; been matched, both in width and in grain. Looking at the pictures
&gt; there appears to have been no attempt at all to match these two pieces
&gt; of wood, either in equal width and certainly no grain matching. That
&gt; would worry the hell out of me.

&gt; The method by which the top is mounted onto the base stem, is also a
&gt; worry and all wrong if this were an English table, but again, this may
&gt; be an American characteristic, although, I would doubt this very much,
&gt; because the work/construction on underside of this table is so bloody
&gt; crude. Also, on an English version, special attention would have been
&gt; given to the catch mechanism itself. Brass would be the order of the
&gt; day on an English table, again, on this table, the mechanism is rather
&gt; crude, almost being crude for crude's sake, deliberately, IMO to give
&gt; a false impression of age. A crude, almost handmade looking catch
&gt; implying .. &quot;hey this has got to be right, look at this old catch&quot;
&gt; when in fact it doesn't look right at all. That catch is something
&gt; like one would find on a garden gate, if it is original, then the guy
&gt; that made this table needs a good kick up the ass ... IMO.

&gt; The method by which the cross parallel bearers (stretchers) have been
&gt; attached to the table top, dear god!! .. big ugly screws!! and only
&gt; *two* per cross bearer!!??!! and attached at the extreme ends only!!
&gt; .. a big NO NO for me I'm afraid. No attention to detail at all. On
&gt; an English table these screws would be well counter-sunk and then
&gt; plugged up and carefully finished with a wooden dowel, and more screws
&gt; than merely two per cross bearer. The bearers themselves would have
&gt; been nicely finished, all the sharp edges taken off and rounded and
&gt; not polished. They appear to be polished in the picture?? .. the
&gt; underside of the table also appears to have some sort of finish on it?

&gt; Mandi, I am not being negative for the sake of it. IMHO there just
&gt; isn't the quality and the craftsmanship for a table of this ilk, and
&gt; the craftsman, even a country craftsman, would have paid more
&gt; attention to the underside of this table.

&gt; My opinion, FWIW, the top either doesn't belong to the pod, or the top
&gt; has been heavily work at, or the top is simply a completely made-up
&gt; piece. If that is so the the pod itself would come under suspicion.

&gt; It's a real pity, because in the first (original) picture of the table
&gt; it really looked the biz, but now having viewed the underside and the
&gt; general construction all I can say, I hope you paid that &quot;gal&quot; by
&gt; credit card or at least by cheque and it was hopefully only a matter
&gt; of a couple of days ago, you can draw your own conclusions from that
&gt; remark.

&gt; Others may have a totally different opinion. Once again Mandi, I am
&gt; sorry if you feel I am being unduly harsh with my opinion, but it's
&gt; just an opinion. ;)

"/> Hi Ronnie &amp; All

Just so people don't get confused &quot; Tiger maple &quot; is just the name given
to the figured grain and not a separate wood species. This grain pattern
is the result of low light conditions when the the tree is young in a
mature forest, it is forced to twist and contort itself to reach
whatever light it can get and the result is this lovely grain. Most of
the points Ronnie raises are on the mark ( as usual) and if Mandi
follows my instructions in my last post she will find out which ones

... a follow up to my last. Here are two 'snap-top' tripod tables in
the &quot;up&quot; position, they show reasonable proportions between table top
size and tripod width and the tops on both sit nicely between a pair,
of the three legs.

The one to the left is Georgian, late 18th century (notice the dish
table top) the table to the right is Victorian, both one piece tops.
Neither, of course, could be described as a candlestand. Sorry I can't
show the reverse as both tables are now long gone to good homes.

"/> Hi Ronnie &amp; All

It is not uncommon to find candlestands in North America with tops that
are much smaller than the size of the base would indicate as
proportional, but size is something to take into consideration when
looking at these pieces. The reason for the small size tops is one I've
given some thought to, when I was a much younger antique person I asked
this question about the tops and no one seemed to know the answer. It
wasn't until I built a copy of one of these tables and used it that the
answer became apparent, with a larger top I couldn't get it close enough
to my wing chair to read by candle light, which I suppose is as good a
reason as any other that I have heard.

I have seen figured maple like &quot;tiger&quot; on late 18th century pieces up to
22&quot; wide, but widths like that are a rarity. Figured maples are
extremely difficult to work with hand tools and suffers greatly with
seasonal humidity changes, so they are mainly used as veneer or on
smaller pieces like work tables or candle stands. Of the maple pieces
I've had in for restoration nearly all of them had two piece tops if the
width was over 10&quot;, today it is hard to find tiger maple in widths much
over 10&quot; ( at least in my area), I was out to my lumber guy's today and
the widest figured bit of Tiger maple he had was 8.25&quot;

"/> Ok, a couple of weeks ago I was called to a private home and one of the
things offered to me was a mahoghany tilt-top &quot;tea table&quot;. It was English,
nicely carved legs, piecrust edge, birdcage support. it was very pretty. I
didn't buy it. She wanted $1500 for it and as you well know, North East
dealers will only pay ONE TENTH of the true value of any antique offered them
(you heard that here on RA, of course) and I didn't feel I could sell it for
$15,000. ;-)
In any case, it was more similar to the picture on the left that Ronnie
posted. Round top. The problem with candlestick tables in the States is
that they were reproduced out the kazoo.....which means almost all of them are
suspect. It has gotten to the point where I just assume every one I see is a
fake unless proven otherwise (I'm sure you have seen this phenomenon on
RA.....rampant scepticism).
If you are like me (and not like Mike....who has obviously had years of
hands-on experience) you might consider purchasing a book called &quot;Fake, Fraud,
or Genuine? Identifying Authentic American Antique Furniture&quot; by Myrna Kaye.
It is excellent. You will also see that even the BEST in the business (Even
Sotheby's and Museums) can be fooled by a forgery that is really really good.
And there ARE artists that can pull it off.

"/> Hi,

I was given to understand that there would be no reason for more than
two screws attaching a cross bearer to the tabletop. In fact, more
than just the two might be detrimental. Something about the woods
expanding and contracting, and with the stretchers attached more
securely, the greater the chance of the tabletop splitting. But
perhaps that was for where the cross bearers were going opposite the
grain of the top? Or I was showed that feature on a table with
inherently different construction. Or maybe the paint fumes coming
into the house from the garage where hubby is working are getting to
me.

"/> Didn't the legs get in the way, Mike? If the legs on a tripod are
protruding way beyond the table top edge and the top is tiny or a lot
smaller then how could you really get the chair close in the first
place. Would appear to me, one would need to jiggle and wriggle the
chair (or the tripod) into an appropriate position, which would seem a
lot of hassle. And merely walking passed the table one is in danger of
catching or kicking the protruding legs of the tripod and bringing the
whole table or the candle to the floor. I believe, not only from the
pleasing proportional aspects, but also for this very reason, in
upsetting the table, legs did not &quot;generally&quot; protrude beyond the
table top edge. This applies not only with a candlestand but with most
all tripod and, quadripod tables, whatever, the general purpose. That
is in my experience.

Anyways, this is what we over here would call a **true** candlestand
within the purist sense ... date c1690 when we really did use
candles. However, by the early 19th century lighting had vastly
improved and by then the low table was not solely used as a
candlestand to the table tops increased for general occasional and
muilt-use.

http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/candlestand.jpg

The forerunner of the low candlestand would have been the torchère
(French: as torch) a TALL stand with a small top and a much wider
base, but a wider base for balance, the torchère was either made from
metal as in the early type, or as later in wood, when wood became the
fashion. It originally had no other function other than for lighting.
This one a torchère, c1720.

http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/torchè re.jpg

In fact, if you look at the pictures I posted earlier ...

http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/snap_top_tripod_tables...

in the left-hand picture, in the background, you should also notice a
torchère in the Chippendale style, (c1770ish) it's way back in the
corner with a blue and white (repro Ming) pot (planter) sitting on
top. This had a small top and a wide base, if it didn't have a wide
base it would topple over.

For those peeps not familiar with the term 'birdcage' ... it's a
construction used under the top of a tripod table to enable it to
revolve as well as tip up. Formed by two squares of wood with four
turned columns (pillars) between, pivoting about the centre column.
The turnings on the birdcage pillars should match the turning (style)
on the tripod stem. It is a desirable feature that will increase the
interest and add *hugely* to the price of the table. The pie-crust
and, any carved cabriole legs, will further increase the value. Alas
many times the birdcage is missing or has been removed in an earlier
restoration job, so period examples now border on the rare. Of course,
a birdcage top may have been added wrongly to a tripod table simply to
increase the desirability so one needs to watch out for faked-up or
later (out of period) added birdcage tops.

The pie-crust top on this table should be, without question, all one
piece of timber, and the pie-crust itself being carved and not an
add-on decoration, and the top will be dished. The table should date
mid 18th century and in the Chippendale (Adam) style. If it's right,
don't mess around with the general public, or try flogging it via the
shop, unless you have a seriously rich client or a purist collector up
your sleeve, just take it up to NYC and enter it into a Christie's or
Sotheby's special sale for 'Fine Period Furniture', then sit back and
wait on the big fat cheque.

Here are a couple of pictures of a birdcage tripod table, c1750, if
right, 10k all day long, and 10k in real money, that is, dirty Pound
notes Sterling.

&gt; Ok, a couple of weeks ago I was called to a private home and one of the
&gt; things offered to me was a mahoghany tilt-top &quot;tea table&quot;. It was English,
&gt; nicely carved legs, piecrust edge, birdcage support. it was very pretty. I
&gt; didn't buy it. She wanted $1500 for it and as you well know, North East
&gt; dealers will only pay ONE TENTH of the true value of any antique offered them
&gt; (you heard that here on RA, of course) and I didn't feel I could sell it for
&gt; $15,000. ;-)
&gt; In any case, it was more similar to the picture on the left that Ronnie
&gt; posted. Round top. The problem with candlestick tables in the States is
&gt; that they were reproduced out the kazoo.....which means almost all of them are
&gt; suspect. It has gotten to the point where I just assume every one I see is a
&gt; fake unless proven otherwise (I'm sure you have seen this phenomenon on
&gt; RA.....rampant scepticism).
&gt; If you are like me (and not like Mike....who has obviously had years of
&gt; hands-on experience) you might consider purchasing a book called &quot;Fake, Fraud,
&gt; or Genuine? Identifying Authentic American Antique Furniture&quot; by Myrna Kaye.
&gt; It is excellent. You will also see that even the BEST in the business (Even
&gt; Sotheby's and Museums) can be fooled by a forgery that is really really good.
&gt; And there ARE artists that can pull it off.
&gt; See ya!

&gt;&gt;It wasn't until I built a copy of one of these tables and used it that the
&gt;&gt;answer became apparent, with a larger top I couldn't get it close enough
&gt;&gt;to my wing chair to read by candle light, which I suppose is as good a
&gt;&gt;reason as any other that I have heard.

&gt; Didn't the legs get in the way, Mike? If the legs on a tripod are
&gt; protruding way beyond the table top edge and the top is tiny or a lot
&gt; smaller then how could you really get the chair close in the first
&gt; place. Would appear to me, one would need to jiggle and wriggle the
&gt; chair (or the tripod) into an appropriate position, which would seem a
&gt; lot of hassle. And merely walking passed the table one is in danger of
&gt; catching or kicking the protruding legs of the tripod and bringing the
&gt; whole table or the candle to the floor. I believe, not only from the
&gt; pleasing proportional aspects, but also for this very reason, in
&gt; upsetting the table, legs did not &quot;generally&quot; protrude beyond the
&gt; table top edge. This applies not only with a candlestand but with most
&gt; all tripod and, quadripod tables, whatever, the general purpose. That
&gt; is in my experience.

&gt; Anyways, this is what we over here would call a **true** candlestand
&gt; within the purist sense ... date c1690 when we really did use
&gt; candles. However, by the early 19th century lighting had vastly
&gt; improved and by then the low table was not solely used as a
&gt; candlestand to the table tops increased for general occasional and
&gt; muilt-use.

&gt; http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/candlestand.jpg

&gt; The forerunner of the low candlestand would have been the torchère
&gt; (French: as torch) a TALL stand with a small top and a much wider
&gt; base, but a wider base for balance, the torchère was either made from
&gt; metal as in the early type, or as later in wood, when wood became the
&gt; fashion. It originally had no other function other than for lighting.
&gt; This one a torchère, c1720.

&gt; http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/torchè re.jpg

&gt; In fact, if you look at the pictures I posted earlier ...

&gt; http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~mckinley/glenbourne/snap_top_tripod_tables...

&gt; in the left-hand picture, in the background, you should also notice a
&gt; torchère in the Chippendale style, (c1770ish) it's way back in the
&gt; corner with a blue and white (repro Ming) pot (planter) sitting on
&gt; top. This had a small top and a wide base, if it didn't have a wide
&gt; base it would topple over.

&gt;&gt; I was out to my lumber guy's today and
&gt;&gt;the widest figured bit of Tiger maple he had was 8.25&quot;

&gt; But wouldn't they have **matched** at least in equal width the timber?
&gt; and attempted to matched the grain? or would they just slapped it
&gt; together in any old way???

&gt; Ronnie
&gt; =====

"/> I guess I will have to post some images of what I'm talking about, the
tops on these pieces I'm referring to are not a lot smaller, if you
dropped the plumb line the top would no more than about 3&quot; smaller than
the span of the pedestal base. The old boys that built these figure
maple pieces were working outside the larger centres and used the local
hardwoods because of the cost of shipping Mahogany inland was expensive.
In most cases these early country cabinet makers tried to match up the
grain patterns, but didn't always use equal width lumber, they used what
they had on hand.

Well, onion tart, I blew it. Called her up first thing in the morning (9 AM)
and I do believe I woke her up. It's gone....sold to a smarter dealer than I.
No fast buck for me (although I was thinking I might keep that table) and no
free subscription for you. :-( Guess I won't make that mistake again (if I
ever get the chance). It looked just like that picture you posted. I
didn't study it closely enough to say without a doubt it was entirely correct.
This is, I suppose, where the less experienced dealer could use a BIG
BROTHER/SISTER to help him/her out. I should have mentioned it sooner.
After that let down I came down with one of my famous sinus/migraine
headaches and have been down for hours. (Doubt it was related, though).
Looks like I'm back up and running now, though.

This is what's bugging me. Did she pass any remarks about the table?
Like, did she indicate in anyway as what she thought it was, or what
it may have been? Did she mention the word, Chippendale?

Over here Fayette, if this house call was anyway local and the other
dealer that bought the table was sort of local dealer, we (the trade)
could ask around the rest of the trade, a few phone calls, a bit of
gossip and within the hour we would have it all sussed. In fact, if
this table was indeed the &quot;genuine&quot; article the jungle drums would be
beating loud and clear within the trade, all on their own without any
prompting. But maybe it doesn't work that way in the US ... I don't

Hi Mike and All,
Here's the best I could do regarding Mike's points below.

1. There are differences in the thicknesses of the top board and it's
supports. The variations aren't readily visible, but do show up when you
measure.

2. The pedestal shaft is a little egg shaped - not significantly, but
again, a difference in width that can be measured. I THINK I see lathe
marks, but it would take more experience than I have to be sure. Since I
don't have a base of knowledge to compare it to, I'm not positive what
I'm seeing! :)

3. Yes on the dovetails, no on the metal brace.

4. The screws are definitely modern.

5. The underside of the top doesn't have tool marks that I could see.
Again, I don't really know the &quot;feel&quot; it should have. The underside of
the legs do have toolmarks that aren't particularly even. There are
distinct toolmarks near the feet so the feet look to be handcarved.

6. Yes, the feline appears to be of Siam origin. Half the the heritage
of this particular collectible is unknown. He loves the camera, and
tries to get into any photo he can!

&gt;&gt; 2.Check the pedestal shaft, it should be more egg shaped than round in

&gt;&gt; turned at much lower speeds and left small grooves like on a record
&gt;&gt; (remember them;~)

&gt;&gt; 3.Check the base of the shaft , the legs should be attached with sliding
&gt;&gt; dovetails rather than dowel pins, quite often these tables would have
&gt;&gt; had a metal brace to keep the legs from splaying.

&gt;&gt; 4.Remove all the screws, screws of this period were blunt, rough looking
&gt;&gt; affairs, often with the slot cut off centre.

&gt;&gt; 5.Look at the underside of the legs and top for tool marks, lay a ruler
&gt;&gt; on edge across the grain and look for scallop like marks running with
&gt;&gt; the grain, figured maples are very hard to plane by hand and it is
&gt;&gt; almost impossible to do it without leaving some tear out in the grain.
&gt;&gt; Power planes leave tiny scallop marks running across the grain ( every
&gt;&gt; 1/8 to 1/4&quot;) and leave the board an even thickness.

&gt;&gt; There are other numerous things to check, but this should get you
&gt;&gt; started Mandi ;~))

&gt;&gt; Hi All!
&gt;&gt; I bought this cute little table a while back just because I liked
it.
&gt;&gt; It's value doesn't matter to me, because I don't intend to sell it.
It
&gt;&gt; looks great in my entryway, and I really enjoy having it. But I'd
like
&gt;&gt; to know a little more about it. I'm pretty good at identifying
glassware
&gt;&gt; (not the good stuff Reyne carries - the lower end stuff) but I don't
&gt;&gt; know a thing about furniture. So hopefully a few of you can help
educate
&gt;&gt; me. If anyone can tell me some of the really basic things like if
this
&gt;&gt; style has a name and what the table's original use might have been,
I'd
&gt;&gt; really appreciate it! Any guesses on age would be welcome as well.

&gt;&gt; Here's a picture:
&gt;&gt; http://www.shop4antiques.com/graphics/table.jpg
&gt;&gt; The table is 28&quot; tall. It has a 14&quot; X 25&quot; oval top. The gal I
bought it
&gt;&gt; from said it is a candlestand since the top is relatively small.
The top
&gt;&gt; is on a hinge-type mechanism so it can be tipped vertical for easier
&gt;&gt; storage. I haven't a clue what kind of wood it is and I don't know
how
&gt;&gt; to tell. It's a nice medium brown, not quite a red as the photo,
with an
&gt;&gt; even grain that kind of reminds me of tiger stripes.

&gt;&gt; Thanks!

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1/8 to 1/4&quot;) and leave the board an even thickness.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are other numerous things to check, but this should get you
&gt;&gt;&gt; started Mandi ;~))

"/> Hi Mandi, I'm glad you had some fun with it and learned something at the
same time. To check the underside of the table for hand plane marks just
run your finger across the grain, if it was hand planed it will feel
like a series of waves with the peaks about 1.5-2&quot; apart.
