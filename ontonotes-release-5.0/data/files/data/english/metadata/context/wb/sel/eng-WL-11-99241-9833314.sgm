And you thought a lump of coal in a stocking was a cruel Christmas gift.... The coal could at least be burned to help heat a house. If Big Agribusiness and a handful of so-called clean energy companies have their way, you won't be able to afford heat--or food to eat--in a future holiday season.

Well, maybe not you --the reader--but for millions of the world's poorest people, acute hunger, preceded by even worse poverty, best describes the fate that awaits them. Of course, it is all for a good, clean cause, according to biofuels-backing politicians.

Really. In a world where tens of millions go hungry, the ethically deprived politicians of the economically developed nations are legislating biofueled famine and food inflation in the name of combating global warming and achieving energy independence (an unrealistic but wildly popular goal).

Growing crops to fuel cars instead of to feed people and animals--please take time to think about that during this holiday season. Could the teachings of any great religious or spiritual tradition possibly support such a sickeningly sinful scheme? With all due respect to the predominantly Christian communities that comprise American Corn Country, can anyone imagine Jesus turning his back on the multitudes in order to feed--i.e. fuel--a fleet of SUVs? Would Jesus turn water into ethanol instead of wine? The questions admittedly border on blasphemy. But mandating biofuels, especially water-gulping corn-based ethanol, is exactly that--a blasphemy--against reason and common sense and universal ideals of social justice, righteousness, and loving-kindness.

As shown by the digest below, however, there is reason to believe that the madness will end. Just as politicians from left to right have lined up to back biofuels, a similar phenomenon is emerging on the opposite side of the issue. The Communist Fidel Castro and the libertarian Cato Institute have both come out strongly against biofuels. Greenpeace and The Heritage Foundation have condemned biofuels. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Monetary Fund have raised warning flags about the threat that biofuels pose to food security. Throughout the developing world, people are mobilizing to pressure their governments and the international community to say no to biofuels. Europeans are also organizing against biofuels. Even communities in the American Midwest are questioning the supposed benefits of the wasteful biofuels boom. Already, a few farmers can be heard saying: &amp;quot;Hell no! We don't want to grow food for fuel.&amp;quot; They find the idea fundamentally offensive.

Yes, there is reason for hope. Seasons change. Tides turn. Opinion shifts. Redemption is always possible--even for politicians.

Who knows? Maybe the Ghost of Christmas Present will visit European and American lawmakers this holiday season to remind them--the way it reminded Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Caro l--of the suffering caused by Want and Ignorance.

But to compare Scrooge, the main character in Dickens' novel, to today's mandate-mad politicians is unfair--to Scrooge. Though mean spirited and miserly, he at least supported the social order of his era. When asked to contribute to the poor on Christmas Eve, he inquired if the workhouses and the prisons were still operating. Assured that they were, he expressed relief, knowing that the poor could continue to toil in misery and survive (more or less) at the edge of existence. In contrast with the fictional Scrooge, the politicians backing biofuels are effectively overturning the established world order by robbing the poor of the most basic human right--to food.

Snatching bread from the mouths of the poor is actually much worse than dickensian--an adjective that refers to the cruelties of Victorian England. It is hard to find a word to adequately describe the horror that is being perpetrated in the name of clean energy....

A Small Sampling of What Others Are Saying About Biofuels

AllAfrica.com :

Proponents of the agro-fuels boom say that agro-fuels are &amp;quot;clean and green&amp;quot; because the photosynthesis process from fuel crops removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and can reduce fossil fuel consumption.

Critics, however, argued that when the full &amp;quot;life cycle&amp;quot; of agro-fuels is considered -- from land clearing to automotive consumption, the moderate emissions savings are undone by far greater emissions from deforestation, burning, peat drainage, cultivation and soil carbon losses and high rates of soil erosion.

The second belief is that agro-fuels will not result in deforestation as proponents of agro-fuels argue that fuel crops planted on ecologically degraded lands will improve rather than destroy the environment.

However, critics say the introduction of agro-fuel plantations will simply push indigenous people and subsistence farmers out of their lands. In Brazil, for example, the biodiverse ecosystems of the Mata Atlantica, the Cerrado and the Pantanal indigenous communities have been re-classified as &amp;quot;degraded&amp;quot; land suitable for agro-fuel plantations.

The communities are being pushed to the &amp;quot;agricultural frontier&amp;quot; of the Amazon where deforestation will intensify. Soyabeans supply 40 percent of Brazil's diesel fuels. Palm oil plantations for biodiesel are the primary cause of forest loss in Indonesia while Malaysia, the world's largest producer of palm oil, has lost a massive 87 percent of its tropical forests.

The third myth: &amp;quot;Agro-fuels will bring rural development.&amp;quot; In reality, critics say the energy-hungry corporations of the North are pouring money into Africa for agro-fuel crop production fuelling a land rush &amp;quot;reminiscent of Europe's initial colonial expansion&amp;quot;. They argue that the market power of corporations such as Cargill and ADM, Monsanto and Syngenta allows them to extract profits without meaningful benefits to the African farmers.

Robert Samuelson, Washington Post Writer's Group:

Biofuels became politically fashionable because they combined benefits for farmers with popular causes: increasing energy &amp;quot;security&amp;quot;; curbing global warming. Unfortunately, the marriage is contrived. Not only are fuel savings meager, so are the environmental benefits. Substituting corn-based ethanol for gasoline results in little reduction in greenhouse gases. Indeed, the demand for biofuels encourages deforestation in developing countries; the New York Times recently reported the clearing of Indonesian forests to increase palm oil production for biofuel. Forests absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

This is not a case of unintended consequences. A new generation of &amp;quot;cellulosic&amp;quot; fuels (made from grasses, crop residue or wood chips) might deliver benefits, but the adverse effects of corn-based ethanol were widely anticipated. Government subsidies reflect the careless and cynical manipulation of worthy public goals for selfish ends. That the new farm bill may expand the ethanol mandates confirms an old lesson: Having embraced a giveaway, politicians cannot stop it, no matter how dubious.

Grist :

The reality, of course, is that these fuels (i.e., industrially grown food monocrops) are already wreaking all kinds of havoc and are likely to remain the only commercially viable biofuels for the foreseeable future (i.e., forever)....

Which will be cheaper to produce: cane ethanol, palm oil and other crops grown on dirt-cheap land now occupied by nature (in the Congo, Amazon, Cerrado, etc.), or the cellulosic and algae-based fuels being studied in labs and test facilities? If these &amp;quot;second generation&amp;quot; fuels (to date having no use except as an excuse to support the &amp;quot;first generation&amp;quot; ones) ever get out of the test facilities and labs, they will have to compete economically with billions of dollars invested at the taxpayer's expense in &amp;quot;first generation fuels.&amp;quot;

Black Star News :

Proponents of the agrofuels boom say that agro-fuels are ‘clean and green’ because the photosynthesis process from fuel crops removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and can reduce fossil fuel consumption.

Critics, however, argued that when the full ‘life cycle’ of agro-fuels is considered –from land clearing to automotive consumption, the moderate emissions savings are undone by far greater emissions from deforestation, burning, peat drainage, cultivation and soil carbon losses and high rates of soil erosion.

The second belief is that agro-fuels will not result in deforestation as proponents of agro-fuels argue that fuel crops planted on ecologically degraded lands will improve rather than destroy the environment.

In Brazil, for example, the biodiverse ecosystems of the Mata Atlantica, the Cerrado and the Pantanal indigenous communities has been re-classified as ‘degrade’ land suitable for agro-fuel plantations.

Ronald Baily, &amp;quot;Don't Buy Into Biofuel Boondoggle,&amp;quot; The Hartford Courant :

Biofuels are commercially questionable, do not materially advance energy independence, and may not even help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Naturally, Congress wants to mandate them.

Why? Well, Iowa caucus voters win; Archer Daniels Midland wins; and special-interest contributors to political campaigns win. Bioethanol is just a subsidy boondoggle masquerading as a solution to America's energy problems. But it does help get some politicians elected.

The Heritage Foundation :

Knowing that first-generation fuels are losing credibility as an efficient energy solution, advocates of biofuels are beginning to consider second-generation biofuels. Second-generation biofuels constitute fuel generated from forest and field waste, switchgrass, crop residues, and cellulosic biomass. Interestingly, second-generation biofuels were ranked seventh by respondents to the aforementioned survey.

Second-generation biofuels are far from a proven technology. Doubts abound concerning whether that they can meet energy demands and protect the environment. Foisting a new mandate before infrastructure or technology is adequately developed is misguided.

In fact, the next generation of biofuels may be as environmentally damaging as the first. A Competitive Enterprise Institute study released in June 2007 reported that no manufacturing plants exist that are capable of producing mass amounts of cellulosic ethanol. Plants can only produce enough for demonstration purposes. Additionally, distinguished agriculturalists are reluctant to endorse second-generation biofuels because of the adverse ecological effects. They claim that only a portion of crop residue can be removed from fields to produce cellulosic ethanol, because that residue is imperative to recycling organic matter, retaining moisture, and preventing soil erosion on farms. Furthermore, according to an Iowa State study, switchgrass will not have the ability to compete with corn for the production of ethanol. It does not bode well for the industry that the only way for corn-produced ethanol to be competitive is through preferential treatment from Washington.

&amp;quot;How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor,&amp;quot; C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer
From Foreign Affairs , May/June 2007

The world's poorest people already spend 50 to 80 percent of their total household income on food. For the many among them who are landless laborers or rural subsistence farmers, large increases in the prices of staple foods will mean malnutrition and hunger. Some of them will tumble over the edge of subsistence into outright starvation, and many more will die from a multitude of hunger-related diseases.

And for what? Limited environmental benefits at best. Although it is important to think of ways to develop renewable energy, one should also carefully examine the eager claims that biofuels are &amp;quot;green.&amp;quot; Ethanol and biodiesel are often viewed as environmentally friendly because they are plant-based rather than petroleum-based. In fact, even if the entire corn crop in the United States were used to make ethanol, that fuel would replace only 12 percent of current U.S. gasoline use. Thinking of ethanol as a green alternative to fossil fuels reinforces the chimera of energy independence and of decoupling the interests of the United States from an increasingly troubled Middle East.

Should corn and soybeans be used as fuel crops at all? Soybeans and especially corn are row crops that contribute to soil erosion and water pollution and require large amounts of fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel to grow, harvest, and dry. They are the major cause of nitrogen runoff -- the harmful leakage of nitrogen from fields when it rains -- of the type that has created the so-called dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, an ocean area the size of New Jersey that has so little oxygen it can barely support life. In the United States, corn and soybeans are typically planted in rotation, because soybeans add nitrogen to the soil, which corn needs to grow. But as corn increasingly displaces soybeans as a main source of ethanol, it will be cropped continuously, which will require major increases in nitrogen fertilizer and aggravate the nitrogen runoff problem.

Nor is corn-based ethanol very fuel efficient. Debates over the &amp;quot;net energy balance&amp;quot; of biofuels and gasoline -- the ratio between the energy they produce and the energy needed to produce them -- have raged for decades. For now, corn-based ethanol appears to be favored over gasoline, and biodiesel over petroleum diesel -- but not by much. Scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have calculated that the net energy ratio of gasoline is 0.81, a result that implies an input larger than the output. Corn-based ethanol has a ratio that ranges between 1.25 and 1.35, which is better than breaking even. Petroleum diesel has an energy ratio of 0.83, compared with that of biodiesel made from soybean oil, which ranges from 1.93 to 3.21. (Biodiesel produced from other fats and oils, such as restaurant grease, may be more energy efficient.)

Similar results emerge when biofuels are compared with gasoline using other indices of environmental impact, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The full cycle of the production and use of corn-based ethanol releases less greenhouse gases than does that of gasoline, but only by 12 to 26 percent. The production and use of biodiesel emits 41 to 78 percent less such gases than do the production and use of petroleum-based diesel fuels.

Joseph Romm, Salon.com

As biofuel mandates drive up the demand for corn and soy, the prices of those food crops shoot up, making them -- and all their derivatives, like corn syrup and animal feed -- much more expensive. The higher price leads farmers to grow corn and soy in place of crops like wheat, whose prices then rise as supply drops in the face of growing demand.

One quarter -- and climbing -- of the U.S. corn crop is now being used for biofuels. In a recent article, &amp;quot;The End of Cheap Food,&amp;quot; the Economist points out that its measure of average world food prices is &amp;quot;higher today than at any time since it was created in 1845.&amp;quot; In just the past two years, food prices have jumped 75 percent in real terms. Some of this jump is due to changing diet from increased wealth, especially in Asia, which leads to a rise in meat use, and a rise in the price of grain for feed. That said, the Economist points out the amazing statistic that &amp;quot;the demands of America's ethanol program alone account for over half the world's unmet need for cereals.&amp;quot; No wonder the magazine editorializes that the price rise is &amp;quot;the self-inflicted result of America's reckless ethanol subsidies.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The Ethanol Scam,&amp;quot; Jay Ambrose, Scripps Howard News Service

New energy legislation is careening toward a calamitous collision with American lives, especially ethanol provisions that will hike food prices and foul the environment while saving little or nothing on fossil-fuel consumption.

The mandate that tens of billions more subsidized gallons of ethanol be used in our cars each year by 2022 is little short of a scam, a gift to politically important corn farmers and others under the pretense that you, the taxpayer, are thereby awarded the enhanced prospect of energy independence and less global warming. No such thing.

Instead, for starters, you are sponsoring a chance to pay more at the grocery store and to keep paying more while the yay-voting members of Congress and President Bush no doubt hope you won't blame them, as you should.

The Guardian :

It used to be a matter of good intentions gone awry. Now it is plain fraud. The governments using biofuel to tackle global warming know that it causes more harm than good. But they plough on regardless. In theory, fuels made from plants can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by cars and trucks. Plants absorb carbon as they grow - it is released again when the fuel is burned. By encouraging oil companies to switch from fossil plants to living ones, governments on both sides of the Atlantic claim to be &amp;quot;decarbonising&amp;quot; our transport networks.
