United States Instigated Iran's Nuclear Program 30 Years Ago

' The White House staffers, who are trying to deny Iran the right to
develop its own nuclear energy capacity have conveniently forgotten that
the United States was the midwife to the Iranian nuclear program 30
years ago. Every aspect of Iran's current nuclear development was
approved and encouraged by Washington in the 1970s. President Gerald
Ford offered Iran a full nuclear cycle in 1976, and the only reactor
currently about to become operative, the reactor in Bushire, was started
before the Iranian revolution with U.S. approval.

Kenneth Timmerman, in Countdown to Crisis: The Coming Nuclear
Showdown with Iran presents a misleading description of this plant,
claiming again and again that the facility might be used to produce
nuclear fuel.

As the late Tom Stauffer and I wrote in June, 2003, the Bushire
(Bushehr) reactor--a "light water" reactor--does not produce weapons
grade Plutonium. It produces Pu 240, Pu241 and Pu242. Although these
isotopes could theoretically be weaponized, the process is extremely
long and complicated, and also untried. To date no nuclear weapon has
ever been produced with plutonium produced with the kind of reactor at
Bushire. Moreover, the plant would have to be completely shut down to
extract the fuel rods, making the process immediately open to detection
and inspection. (The plant IS shut down to change the fuel rods, but
only every 30-40 months to provide longer and better energy generation)

By contract, the Dimona reactor in Israel--a "heavy water"
reactor--is an example of a reactor that is ideal for producing weapons
fuel. It produces Pu239 and the fuel rods can be extracted "on the fly."
without any need to shut down the plant or alter its operation. The fuel
rods are exchanged every few weeks.

It is paired with a companion piece explaining why nuclear power
makes perfect sense for the Iranian economic situation. This article can
be found here .

A number of former officials have questioned the proposition that the
United States fostered Iran's nuclear development. Certainly it is
inconvenient for their present course of action to have to admit that an
American hand was present in the gestation of the program.

Professor Ahmad Sadri, Chair of the Department of Sociology and
Anthropology at Lake Forest College in Illinois was a young man in Iran
when the United States was touting nuclear power facilities to the
government of the Shah. He reminisces:

The image that came to me was the late sixties' lavish exhibit of the
United States in Tehran's annual International Exhibit that was
fashioned as a nuclear reactor complete with a white dome. Easily the
most popular exhibit in the entire international gala, the American
exhibit sported by far the longest snaking lines of eager visitors. It
was dedicated to the single theme of extolling the virtues of atomic
energy and the feasibility of its transfer to Iran. White clad
attendants offered inspiring tours to small flocks of the overawed
visitors and encouraged them to emulate atomic researchers by lifting
small cubes and pyramids laying behind thick Plexiglas walls with the
use of mechanical hands. That image found its companion a few days ago
as I soaked in the hot tub of my local gym in one of the northern burbs
of Chicago with a gentleman that turned out to be Octave J. Du Temple,
executive director emeritus of the American Nuclear Society. He fondly
reminisced about half a dozen trips in early seventies to Tehran and
Shiraz in order to participate in conferences and summits on "transfer
of nuclear technology." For whatever it's worth, this native's account
is

awash in images that confirm a fair amount of enthusiasm on behalf of
the United States for Iran's nuclear program in the 1970's.

Washington International Lawyer Donald Weadon points out that after
1972, and the oil crisis, the United States was rabidly pursuing
investment opportunities in Iran, including selling nuclear power
plants. He writes:

' . . . utilizing the good offices of the Hoover Institution and the

self-interest of Bechtel and other U.S. A&amp;E contractors who found

significant profit in Nuclear Power Plants at home and overseas (e.g,
Taiwan), the Iranians were wooed hard with the prospect of nuclear power
from trusted, U.S.-backed suppliers, with the prospect of the
reservation of significant revenues from oil exports for foreign and
domestic investment (this was not solely and Iranian pipe dream, as the
Kuwaitis had targeted by 1980 to be obtaining half of their GNP from
investment income, not sales of wasting assets like oil). Obviously, the
principal benefit from the U.S. perspective was the significant
absorption of petrodollars, NOT Iran's fiscal and national best
interest. '

Despite current White House denials of U.S. instigation of the
program, there is absolutely no question that the United States did not
oppose Iran's nuclear development in the 1970's--even to the point of
facilitating training for Iran's senior engineers at MIT, CalTech and
other U.S. institutions. Nor is it in question that the Bushire plant
was started before the revolution with the United States' blessing.

American dissimulation on this point reveals some interesting motives
on Washington's part. Iran under the Shah was as much of a threat to its
neighbors (including Iraq) as it might be said to be today. Its nuclear
ambitions then could have been inflated and denigrated in exactly the
same way they are being inflated and denigrated today, but the U.S. was
blissfully unconcerned. The big, big difference is that Iran is now
perceived to be a threat to Israel, and that is why we see retired
military as consultants to the news media bandying about plans to bomb
multiple sites over an area the size of California, Arizona and Nevada
(Good luck!) .

Even those who admit that the United States helped start Iran's
current nuclear development claim that two factors make a difference in
how Iran should be treated today as opposed to the 1970's: Iran's
concealment of nuclear energy development activities in the past and
President Ahmadinejad's remarks on Israel.

What White House officials never tell the American public is that
President Ahmadinejad's remarks have little or no connection with any
probable action on Iran's part regarding Israel (or "the Zionist regime"
to be strictly accurate regarding his reference). President Ahmadinejad
has no effective power in this area, and his remarks aren't even
embraced by Iran's clerical leaders. His remarks are widely understood
as a clumsy attempt to pander to his own right-wing base in an attempt
to shore up his faltering power within the Iranian government.

However, the second proposition is equally specious. It is fruitful
to examine the now conventional wisdom that Iran had "regularly hidden
information about its nuclear program" etc. as if this in and of itself
was proof of a nuclear weapons program. Of course, it is not, although
many breathlessly cite it as the principal smoking gun.

First of all, much of what the United States has called "concealment"
was never concealed at all when the reports of the United Nations
inspection team are examined. Many of the charges about removing topsoil
and bulldozing material at some of the research sites never took place.
However, even if one concedes that Iran did conceal some processes,
whatever concealment of whatever activity started 18-20 years ago when
the Revolution was still young and Ayatollah Khomeini was still alive.

There was, of course, a different Iranian administration than is in
power today, or that was in power when the nuclear question became an
issue. If George W. Bush were to be held responsible for things that
happened 18 years ago, or even 8 years ago, there would be howling in
the Capitol. The myth of a monolithic unchanging government in Iran is
indeed very powerful, overwhelming all common sense and reason.

Second, whatever Iran did or didn't do in the past, they are in
compliance with the NNPT at present. Indeed, there would be no way to
accuse them of anything if they were not so compliant.

Third, it is essential to emphasize that there are many countries who
have concealed their nuclear activities (Israel, India, Pakistan,
Brazil, North Korea), and some who still do--it is an open secret.
Mohammad Elbaradei gave a half-dozen plausible reasons why Iran might
have felt it prudent to conceal its activities (the U.S. embargo, the
ran-Iraq war, the U.S. actions in Gulf War I and II right next door, the
U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan's possession of nuclear
weapons-again right next door, the hidden weapons program in Israel,
etc. etc. ). This didn't excuse the concealment, but neither is it proof
that Iran has a weapons' program at present. In fact, no one has shown
that such a weapons program exists.

The mantra "Iran must not get nuclear weapons" has been repeated so
often now that most people have come to believe that Iran has them or is
getting them. Has anyone stopped to think that this only became an issue
when the neoconservative agenda to "remake" the Middle East--including
Iran-became actualized? The Iran nuclear crisis is truly a manufactured
crisis, based on the flimsiest of evidence and reasoning. I can only
hope that soberer minds rethink this position.

The tragedy would be that in the end, the U.S. may goad Iran in to a
real nuclear weapons program. The Iranians may reason that since they
are being punished for the crime anyway, they might as well commit it. '
