I sense a stranger but its in apathy that I do it.. Why would I even
bother to engage in conversation person B?  But there is a beautiful
woman on the other end of the bar.. I see her not only walk, but
glide.. Am I in love?  Not at all.. it is the impulse that comes with
all men for all beautiful women.. why would all such men be in love,
Love being a precious treasure?  But believing it is love, I approach
her and make conversation.  She seems interesting, and I want to make
love to her that night.  I take her to my villa and we drop our
clothes on the bedroom floor.  There is a scar on my dick that
embarasses me, so I try to use the dark like a Lover.. When I am
through, she calls for me and I am already out the door to look for a
pack of cigarettes.  I smoke two and come back to revisit her having
been vitalized by the two that I smoked.. I talk to her this time more
personally and we begin to form ties of affection.. soon this becomes
a history built up as we progress into a relationship that should not
be broken for the history that we've built up..who else knows of my
weaknesses? we make love again, but this time it feels different..it
is as if I need her in a new way rather than simply porking her away..
she gets into an accident awhile later and I respond with anxiety and
my hair is in a mess as I've just gotten out of bed.  I rush to the
emergency room, and find that she is having an abortion.  She kept the
baby in her stomach and starved it so it would die rather than to be
seen where those who know her would then realize she was pregnant.
She does not like the idea of having children.  I come to her and
strike her against the face with the back of my hand.  "Weren't you
once Don Juan?  Why now this darkside like a darkened council?"  In
Love, there are victims to Love.. the baby had a premature death
having suffered in the womb to its very end.. Love propelled me to
slap her, to avenge the suffering fetus.  With love brothers are
divided against each other, sisters against sisters, and husband
against wife.. why do some lose passion as a virtue?  We would be
impotent in regards to moments where 100% percent of your love was
necessary.. the 100% of my love made me slap her.. it wasn't up to
me.. it was a moral requirement.. this morality which darkens the
council..
