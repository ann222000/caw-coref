WASHINGTON,DC (NS/TCV) -

Traditional Values Coalition Chairman Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's
commentary this week is on Joseph Onek, a former Open Society
Institute lawyer who was just hired to become Senior Counsel to
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi...

Onek's association with the Open Society Institute is of great concern
to TVC because the OSI is George Soros' flagship organization to bring
about radical social change in our culture...

As Rev. Sheldon noted, "The OSI funnels millions of dollars into
various leftist causes, including euthanasia, open borders, abortion,
homosexual activism, marijuana legalization, the undermining of our
nation's war on terrorism and other neo-Marxist visions of social
justice. A list of OSI's grantees (posted on the
"discoverthenetworks.org" web site) reads like a phone book of every
anti-American, pro-abortion, pro-homosexual group in America."

Rev. Sheldon concluded with this observation: "George Soros must be
pleased to have one of his operatives a heartbeat away from Speaker of
the House Pelosi. Did Onek get his job with Pelosi through the
influence of Soros? Was Onek placed in her office to direct policy
decisions? What role does Onek play in Soros' shadow government."
