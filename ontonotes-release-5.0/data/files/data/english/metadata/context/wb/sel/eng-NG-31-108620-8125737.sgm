Hello folks,

just saw an interesting article on NewScientist.com. According to it
the latest bio fuel crase really is a terrible idea. It appears to me
that it really might be true.

Below the full text of the article.

Forget biofuels - burn oil and plant forests instead

* 19:10 16 August 2007
* NewScientist.com news service
* Catherine Brahic

It sounds counterintuitive, but burning oil and planting forests to
compensate is more environmentally friendly than burning biofuel. So
say scientists who have calculated the difference in net emissions
between using land to produce biofuel and the alternative: fuelling
cars with gasoline and replanting forests on the land instead.

They recommend governments steer away from biofuel and focus on
reforestation and maximising the efficiency of fossil fuels instead.

The reason is that producing biofuel is not a &quot;green process&quot;. It
requires tractors and fertilisers and land, all of which means burning
fossil fuels to make &quot;green&quot; fuel. In the case of bioethanol produced
from corn - an alternative to oil - &quot;it's essentially a zero-sums
game,&quot; says Ghislaine Kieffer, programme manager for Latin America at
the International Energy Agency in Paris, France (see Complete carbon
footprint of biofuel - or is it?).

What is more, environmentalists have expressed concerns that the
growing political backing that biofuel is enjoying will mean forests
will be chopped down to make room for biofuel crops such as maize and
sugarcane. &quot;When you do this, you immediately release between 100 and
200 tonnes of carbon [per hectare],&quot; says Renton Righelato of the
World Land Trust, UK, a conservation agency that seeks to preserve
rainforests.
Century-long wait

Righelato and Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, UK,
calculated how long it would take to compensate for those initial
emissions by burning biofuel instead of gasoline. The answer is
between 50 and 100 years. &quot;We cannot afford that, in terms of climate
change,&quot; says Righelato.

The researchers also compared how much carbon would be stored by
replanting forests with how much is saved by burning biofuel grown on
the land instead of gasoline.

They found that reforestation would sequester between two and nine
times as much carbon over 30 years than would be saved by burning
biofuels instead of gasoline (see bar chart, right). &quot;You get far more
carbon sequestered by planting forests than you avoid emissions by
producing biofuels on the same land,&quot; says Righelato.

He and Spracklen conclude that if the point of biofuels policies is to
limit global warming, &quot;policy makers may be better advised in the
short term to focus on increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel use,
to conserve existing forests and savannahs, and to restore natural
forest and grassland habitats on cropland that is not needed for
food.&quot;

They do admit, however, that biofuels made from woody materials such
as prairie grasses may have an advantage over reforestation - although
it is difficult to say for now as such fuels are still in development
(see Humble grasses may be the best source of biofuel).

Forests at high latitudes have been found to sequester less carbon
than tropical forests (see Some forests may speed global warming). But
Righelato says this does not affect his calculations as biofuel crops
are not, by and large, grown in these areas.

That fossil fuel emissions are responsible for the current increase
in CO2 in the atmosphere is established beyond reasonable doubt.
The contrary position is about as sensible as believing the earth
is flat.  Not even the fossil fuel companies dispute this.

We can calculate the CO2 released from fossil fuel combustion.
We can verify this by carbon isotope measurements, and
by measurement of the decline in O2 in the atmosphere.  What
we learn is that if fossil fuels were not being burned, the contributions
to the change in atmospheric CO2 from all other sources would
be NEGATIVE.    That is, CO2 levels would be DECLINING,
and this has been true for over a century.

They did no such thing, for the simple reason that the data on which
such a thing would rest is highly volatile. How much CO2 is
sequestered by replanted forests depnds on the latitude of the forest
(tropical is better), the state of the soil and the type and variety
of the vegetation. It also ignores the other consequences of
conventional combustion -- amongst them acid rain, which destroys
forests and triggers increasing decomposition.

And of course, it utterly ignores the other negative aspects of
burning gasoline -- carbon monoxide, benzine and various other nasties
being released.

But the stupidity doesn't end there regrettably ... as we shall see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Let's look at the mechanisms for this. If there is a fund to
&quot;reforest&quot; plainly it can only go to those who have cut them down.
Consequently, the plan builds in an incentive to cut them down so as
to be paid to restablish them. That's got to be stupid and utterly
ruins the model. What you really need to do is to give incentives to
protect forests and establish new ones.

Moreover, the model assumes crude oil will always be available, when
the reality is that production is likely to decline and demand
increase, unless something else begins to bear some of the load.

No, it doesn't. Tractors can be operated on alcohol fuels, or as
hybrids, or as purely electric vehciles, recharged from renewable
sources.

Combining c3 and c4 pathway plants radically reduces the need for
nitrogen-based fertilisers, cince c4 pathway plants -- such as rye,
switchgrass (panicum), soy -- fix nitrogen in the soil. Potassium can
be had from wastes such as &quot;vinasse&quot; (a by product of ethanol
production from sugarcane) or even wood ash. Interplanting food crops
such as corn with fuel crops such as panicum can mean both of them are
produced more efficiently in energy terms and prevent damaging run-off
into water tables. The stover from the corn can be used in
vermiculture with other organic wastes to return nutrient to the soil
and the corn mash and panicum can be used to make ethanol or other
alcohol fuels. The leftover lignin can be burned for energy or again,
returned to the soil after composting with other nutrients.

Yes, but nobody is saying that it would be good to chop down

Why haven't the researchers looked at places where marginal land with
sparse endogenous vegetation can be used to raise hardy crops like
mallee, jatropha and similar? Because it wouldn't suit their agenda.

False dilemma fallacy: I've no problem at all with reforesting. This

gasoline is sensible if there is an alternative that is better. There
are many.

I've no problem with doing this, although it would be even better if
they focused on reducing the number of passenger and goods miles in
vehicles burning gasoline/petrodiesel and/or increasing the ration of
weight carried to unit of fossil fuel combusted.

In many parts of the worls, perennial prairie grasses are endogenous

Roughly 50-66% of the carbon absorbed in mature panicum is locked up
in the 2-3 metres of roots, while the fuel portion is extracted
through coppicing. This means the plant is perpetually growing and
absorbing CO2.

Conventional combustion&quot;. Which one  are you talking about? There are the
three:
1. Normal natural combustion with the emmision of SO2 and fly ash,
2. The combustion after 1970 where the fly ash (alcaline component) are

3. The todays combustion where no SO2 and no fly ash in the smoke.

The acide rains are only in the case 2.

Well not from what I read:

e.g. http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/factsheets/power.asp

|||
Power plants are a major source of air pollution, with coal-fired
power plants spewing 59% of total U.S. sulfur dioxide pollution and
18% of total nitrous oxides every year.4   Coal-fired power plants are
also the largest polluter of toxic mercury pollution5, largest
contributor of hazardous air toxics6, and release about 50% of
particle pollution

...

Power plants are second only to automobiles as the greatest source of
NOx emissions.9   When nitrogen oxide (NOx) reacts with volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight, smog (ground level ozone)
forms. Of the six major criteria air pollutants regulated by the EPA,
NOx emissions have historically been the hardest to control. One of
the contributing factors is that NOx emissions from huge dirty coal
plants in one region can easily pollute areas hundreds of miles
downwind. The American Lung Association estimates that almost half-48%
or 140.5 million- of Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of
smog

... today most existing power plants are between 30-50 years old and
are up to 10 times dirtier than new power plants.3   We are now faced
with a disproportionate amount of pollution coming from these old,
dirty, under-controlled plants.

|||

|||
... considerable amounts of SO2 is presently being emitted into ground
- level air, particulary over land masses in the Northern Hemisphere.
The main human source of SO2 is the combustion, especially in electric
power plants, of mined coal that tends to contain 1 to 5% sulfur.
About half of the sulfur is trapped as inclusions in the mineral
content of coal.  If the coal is pulverized before combustion, this
type of sulfur can be removed mechanically.  The other half of the
sulfur however, is bonded in the complex carbon structure and cannot
be removed without expensive processing.

Granted that latitude, the state of soil, the type and variety of
vegetation, all do matter. It´s the total equation after all which
matters.

The problem when such ideas are presented to the world, wether it be
planting or biofuel growing, the case appears only to work when
conditions are ideal, i.e. you are running things in the most
efficient manner possible.

So far neither has been the case, i.e. CO2 recovery through
forestation hasen´t been rigorously enough calculated for the most
ideal planting scemes for every soil type to have been identified for
different latitudes, and biofuel growing is so far nowhere nearly
being run at the greatest CO2 efficient manner possible.

So neither sceme is yet being operated at efficiencies the ideal words
tells they are capable of.

Hmm, quite clearly such funds can also go to landowners who would
plant forests on theyr own land.

Theoretically, after all we are here talking about idealized versions

there is enough coal around. In addition there is oil sand.

&gt; False dilemma fallacy: I've no problem at all with reforesting. This

As far as I can see, biofuel can only to a very small part replase
fossil fuel, lest human landuse on the planet grows to such
proportions that great additional environmental damage shall be
perpetrated.

Why are you so focused on corn-as-fuel? The main reason corn is
promoted as fuel in the US is that sugar has trade protection and is
too expensive to use as ethanol. It's aimed at keeping Brazilian
ethanol out of US markets and protecting US sugar interests.

Given the persistent assertion by the US that it believes in &quot;free
trade&quot; it ought to open its markets and allow people, if they want to
buy Brazilian (or any other) ethanol/alcohol fuel on the best terms
they can get it.

A price actually reflecting the cost of mitigating the harm done by
the combustion of various fuels ought to apply and be allowed to flow
through the entire economy so that eventually, rational choices could
be made about how best to respond. The US should scale down its
military since ultimately, this is in large part aimed at securing
access to crude oil at prices the US think suit its needs. This is a
subsidy and should on crude that is paid in large part with human
lioves on both sides of this conflict. It's paid by US citizens in
loss of freedom, and huge costs associated with being spied upon and
subject to unreasonable search and seizure. Right now, the US is
funding BOTH sides of the so called &quot;war on terror&quot;. This is arrant
stupidity.

Fully recovering carbon based waste, increasing public transport,
getting heavy goods off roads and onto rail and into ships, and so
forth can easily taper and ultimately, substantially reduce the need
for the US to import oil. This is in very nearly everyone's interests.
Almost everyone wins in this scenario.

Why would anyone have it otherwise?

&gt; &gt; Only because you are overly credulous.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Forget biofuels - burn oil and plant forests instead

&gt; &gt; &gt;     * 19:10 16 August 2007
&gt; &gt; &gt;     * NewScientist.com news service
&gt; &gt; &gt;     * Catherine Brahic

&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds counterintuitive, but burning oil and planting forests to
&gt; &gt; &gt; compensate is more environmentally friendly than burning biofuel.

&gt; &gt; It sounds it because the assertion is tosh.

&gt; It all depends on the total equation. In an ideal word you are running
&gt; the thing in the most efficient manner possible, but that appears so
&gt; far to be far from being the case.
">

So let's change it so that it is running at as close to optimum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; So
&gt; &gt; &gt; say scientists who have calculated the difference in net emissions
&gt; &gt; &gt; between using land to produce biofuel and the alternative: fuelling
&gt; &gt; &gt; cars with gasoline and replanting forests on the land instead.

&gt; &gt; They did no such thing, for the simple reason that the data on which
&gt; &gt; such a thing would rest is highly volatile. How much CO2 is
&gt; &gt; sequestered by replanted forests depnds on the latitude of the forest
&gt; &gt; (tropical is better), the state of the soil and the type and variety
&gt; &gt; of the vegetation. It also ignores the other consequences of
&gt; &gt; conventional combustion -- amongst them acid rain, which destroys
&gt; &gt; forests and triggers increasing decomposition.

&gt; &gt; And of course, it utterly ignores the other negative aspects of
&gt; &gt; burning gasoline -- carbon monoxide, benzine and various other nasties
&gt; &gt; being released.

&gt; &gt; But the stupidity doesn't end there regrettably ... as we shall see.

&gt; Granted that latitude, the state of soil, the type and variety of
&gt; vegetation, all do matter. It´s the total equation after all which
&gt; matters.

&gt; The problem when such ideas are presented to the world, wether it be
&gt; planting or biofuel growing, the case appears only to work when
&gt; conditions are ideal, i.e. you are running things in the most
&gt; efficient manner possible.
">

But you can contrive to make it so almost everywhere. Surely the aim
of all rational policy is to approach the optimum?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So far neither has been the case, i.e. CO2 recovery through
&gt; forestation hasen´t been rigorously enough calculated for the most
&gt; ideal planting scemes for every soil type to have been identified for
&gt; different latitudes,
">

True, although here in Australia, we have begun doing exactly this
kind of research. If this had been taken seriously 20 years ago, we'd
know a lot more by now. But now, it must be done so as to establish
sound scientific foundations on the treatment of carbon emissions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and biofuel growing is so far nowhere nearly
&gt; being run at the greatest CO2 efficient manner possible.
">

Precisely why there has to be a ubiquitous cost on all carbon emitting
activities and also, a ubiquitous credit on all carbon-sequestering
activities, both based on rigorous science.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So neither sceme is yet being operated at efficiencies the ideal words
&gt; tells they are capable of.

Non sequitur. Right now, biofuel development is constrained and
predisposed by the current arrangements which are largely designed to
'influence-peddle' rather than develop ratiobnal policy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They recommend governments steer away from biofuel and focus on
&gt; &gt; &gt; reforestation and maximising the efficiency of fossil fuels instead.

&gt; &gt; Let's look at the mechanisms for this. If there is a fund to
&gt; &gt; &quot;reforest&quot; plainly it can only go to those who have cut them down.
&gt; &gt; Consequently, the plan builds in an incentive to cut them down so as
&gt; &gt; to be paid to restablish them. That's got to be stupid and utterly
&gt; &gt; ruins the model. What you really need to do is to give incentives to
&gt; &gt; protect forests and establish new ones.

&gt; &gt; Moreover, the model assumes crude oil will always be available, when
&gt; &gt; the reality is that production is likely to decline and demand
&gt; &gt; increase, unless something else begins to bear some of the load.

&gt; Hmm, quite clearly such funds can also go to landowners who would
&gt; plant forests on their own land.
">

They could

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Theoretically, after all we are here talking about idealized versions
&gt; of the different scemes, liquid fuel can be made out of coal, and
&gt; there is enough coal around. In addition there is oil sand.
">

Yes, it could, but then there would also be the other costs assoictaed
with coal mining -- release of coal gas, deaths of coal miners and
their families, emissions of other toxics to the air and waters, etc.
Burning gasoline also releases huge quanta of toxics. Extracting oil
from coal and even worse, from tar sands, is at the moment, very
energy and carbon intensive, and necessarily so, unlike biofuels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason is that producing biofuel is not a &quot;green process&quot;. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; requires tractors and fertilisers and land, all of which means burning
&gt; &gt; &gt; fossil fuels to make &quot;green&quot; fuel.

&gt; &gt; No, it doesn't. Tractors can be operated on alcohol fuels, or as
&gt; &gt; hybrids, or as purely electric vehciles, recharged from renewable
&gt; &gt; sources.

&gt; Sure, but are they?
">

Yes, they are, but nowhere near as widely as they could be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Combining c3 and c4 pathway plants radically reduces the need for
&gt; &gt; nitrogen-based fertilisers, cince c4 pathway plants -- such as rye,
&gt; &gt; switchgrass (panicum), soy -- fix nitrogen in the soil. Potassium can
&gt; &gt; be had from wastes such as &quot;vinasse&quot; (a by product of ethanol
&gt; &gt; production from sugarcane) or even wood ash. Interplanting food crops
&gt; &gt; such as corn with fuel crops such as panicum can mean both of them are
&gt; &gt; produced more efficiently in energy terms and prevent damaging run-off
&gt; &gt; into water tables. The stover from the corn can be used in
&gt; &gt; vermiculture with other organic wastes to return nutrient to the soil
&gt; &gt; and the corn mash and panicum can be used to make ethanol or other
&gt; &gt; alcohol fuels. The leftover lignin can be burned for energy or again,
&gt; &gt; returned to the soil after composting with other nutrients.

&gt; But so far they are using corn, in USA, and sugarcane, in Brasil.
">

Due to domestic trade policy. If Brazil is willing to sell you ethanol
chepaer than you can make it, you have two options. Find a way of
making it cheaper, or buy theirs. Right now, the US cannot produce
enough crude oil at the cost coming out of Mexico or Venezuela or the
Middle East, and so it buys it in. What's the difference?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of bioethanol produced

&gt; &gt; &gt; the International Energy Agency in Paris, France (see Complete carbon
&gt; &gt; &gt; footprint of biofuel - or is it?).

&gt; &gt; Well yes, because these studies look at corn as a monoculture. They
&gt; &gt; don't look at mixed planting and organic methods.

&gt; I think nobody really denies that better scemes are available than
&gt; growing corn, but corn growing to make biofuel appears to be all the
&gt; rage.

It has NOTHING to do with 'rage' and everything to do with playing
political games with trade.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is more, environmentalists have expressed concerns that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; growing political backing that biofuel is enjoying will mean forests
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be chopped down to make room for biofuel crops such as maize and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sugarcane.

&gt; &gt; This too is a furphy. The world leader in sugar cane based ethanol
&gt; &gt; production -- Brazil, doesn't use rainforest land to produce its sugar
&gt; &gt; cane.

&gt; Think about it. The energy demands of the planet are so massive, that
&gt; if biofuel were to replase fossil fuel, cultivated land would have to
&gt; be expanded quite a bit in order to maintain food production.
">

That makes no sense. What you probably mean to say is that far more
arable land would have to be devoted to biofuel production, and that
this would be at the expense of land for food production. That's the
more common, (but false) claim. Is that your assertion?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Century-long wait

&gt; &gt; &gt; Righelato and Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, UK,

&gt; &gt; Yes, but nobody is saying that it would be good to chop down
&gt; &gt; rainforests (or any other forests) for biofuels. It's not necessary.
&gt; &gt; Why haven't the researchers looked at places where marginal land with
&gt; &gt; sparse endogenous vegetation can be used to raise hardy crops like
&gt; &gt; mallee, jatropha and similar? Because it wouldn't suit their agenda.

&gt; In some cases marginal land might be useful, but then even more of

It would make little difference. The species that live on these lands,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) It does not remove national dependence on foreign energy sources
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which as you can see causes wars).

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Ethanol biofuel can be made from *ANY CELLULOSE*.. wood scraps,
&gt; &gt; &gt; wheat chaff, lawn clippings, raked leaves, ditch weed, sawdust, pond
&gt; &gt; &gt; scum, seaweed... you name it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's the way to go.
&gt; &gt; &gt; No more foreign wars for oil, no more criminal oil families, no more
&gt; &gt; &gt; foreigners buying up America with gas money, no more 'presidents for
&gt; &gt; &gt; life', no more oil industry crap propagandists in this news group.

&gt; &gt; This is absurd. There is no way for the USA to grow enough corn to
&gt; &gt; replase oil from the Middle East.

&gt; Why are you so focused on corn-as-fuel? The main reason corn is
&gt; promoted as fuel in the US is that sugar has trade protection and is
&gt; too expensive to use as ethanol. It's aimed at keeping Brazilian
&gt; ethanol out of US markets and protecting US sugar interests.

&gt; Given the persistent assertion by the US that it believes in &quot;free
&gt; trade&quot; it ought to open its markets and allow people, if they want to
&gt; buy Brazilian (or any other) ethanol/alcohol fuel on the best terms
&gt; they can get it.

&gt; A price actually reflecting the cost of mitigating the harm done by
&gt; the combustion of various fuels ought to apply and be allowed to flow
&gt; through the entire economy so that eventually, rational choices could
&gt; be made about how best to respond. The US should scale down its
&gt; military since ultimately, this is in large part aimed at securing
&gt; access to crude oil at prices the US think suit its needs. This is a
&gt; subsidy and should on crude that is paid in large part with human
&gt; lioves on both sides of this conflict. It's paid by US citizens in
&gt; loss of freedom, and huge costs associated with being spied upon and
&gt; subject to unreasonable search and seizure. Right now, the US is
&gt; funding BOTH sides of the so called &quot;war on terror&quot;. This is arrant
&gt; stupidity.

&gt; Fully recovering carbon based waste, increasing public transport,
&gt; getting heavy goods off roads and onto rail and into ships, and so
&gt; forth can easily taper and ultimately, substantially reduce the need
&gt; for the US to import oil. This is in very nearly everyone's interests.
&gt; Almost everyone wins in this scenario.

&gt; Why would anyone have it otherwise?

The role of the military is to maintain the security of the USA.
Basigly the USA is in the role that the UK had assumed during the
19th. century. The UK had a policy of maintaining a 2/1 ration of
fleet size when compared to the fleet size of the second largest fleet
power. When anyone, most often France during the 18th. and the 19th.
centuries UK allways responded by building more ships itself to
maintain that 2/1 ration ensuring theyr dominance of the world Oceans.

Basigly, the USA has assumed the same role, to lume as a colossus over
the world, and hence ensuring that the world situation fits with its
needs and interests. Now, like with Britain this situation is an
unstable one.

The oil is a small part of the overall issue which is the world
situation that the armed forces are really about.

Now, it doesn´t matter, wether it´s corn or something ellse. The USA
never will be able to replase fossil fuel with bio fuel. The other
environmental impact of increasing the size of the cultivated land to
the required degree would be quite prohibitive.

You are correct, the ethanol fuel hoax is a disaster!

Ethanol as an automobile fuel takes more energy to produce than it
yields when burned in a car engine, thus we spend more money to lose
energy.

We subsidize ethanol by more than 50 cents a gallon, and we burn lots
of oil and coal to make it. The farming needed to produce ethanol
causes needless topsoil erosion, and the entire production process
increases global warming.

The only way to end the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global
warming is through mass production of fission nuclear power plants
producing clean hydrogen fuel. The ethanol scam is a political hoax
designed to make Midwestern corporate farmers rich - and thus gain
their political support - while starving the poor.

Chicken prices have doubled and milk prices are skyrocketing. United
Nations food agencies say their cost for basic foodstuffs has doubled
due to the massive corn harvest wasted on ethanol production, and the
United Nations can no longer afford to feed the world's starving
peoples.

You cannot run cars on food products and expect to feed the 6.7
billion people we now have on Earth. Food cost-based inflation will
speed up the bankruptcy of our Social Security system due to automatic
cost of living index increases.

The ethanol fuel hoax was a disaster born out of political
calculation, not scientific analysis.

&gt; Forget biofuels - burn oil and plant forests instead

&gt;     * 19:10 16 August 2007
&gt;     * NewScientist.com news service
&gt;     * Catherine Brahic

&gt; It sounds counterintuitive, but burning oil and planting forests to
&gt; compensate is more environmentally friendly than burning biofuel. So
&gt; say scientists who have calculated the difference in net emissions
&gt; between using land to produce biofuel and the alternative: fuelling
&gt; cars with gasoline and replanting forests on the land instead.

&gt; They recommend governments steer away from biofuel and focus on
&gt; reforestation and maximising the efficiency of fossil fuels instead.

&gt; The reason is that producing biofuel is not a &quot;green process&quot;. It
&gt; requires tractors and fertilisers and land, all of which means burning
&gt; fossil fuels to make &quot;green&quot; fuel. In the case of bioethanol produced
&gt; from corn - an alternative to oil - &quot;it's essentially a zero-sums
&gt; game,&quot; says Ghislaine Kieffer, programme manager for Latin America at
&gt; the International Energy Agency in Paris, France (see Complete carbon
&gt; footprint of biofuel - or is it?).

&gt; What is more, environmentalists have expressed concerns that the
&gt; growing political backing that biofuel is enjoying will mean forests
&gt; will be chopped down to make room for biofuel crops such as maize and
&gt; sugarcane. &quot;When you do this, you immediately release between 100 and
&gt; 200 tonnes of carbon [per hectare],&quot; says Renton Righelato of the
&gt; World Land Trust, UK, a conservation agency that seeks to preserve
&gt; rainforests.
&gt; Century-long wait

&gt; Righelato and Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, UK,
&gt; calculated how long it would take to compensate for those initial
&gt; emissions by burning biofuel instead of gasoline. The answer is
&gt; between 50 and 100 years. &quot;We cannot afford that, in terms of climate
&gt; change,&quot; says Righelato.

&gt; The researchers also compared how much carbon would be stored by
&gt; replanting forests with how much is saved by burning biofuel grown on
&gt; the land instead of gasoline.

&gt; They found that reforestation would sequester between two and nine
&gt; times as much carbon over 30 years than would be saved by burning
&gt; biofuels instead of gasoline (see bar chart, right). &quot;You get far more
&gt; carbon sequestered by planting forests than you avoid emissions by
&gt; producing biofuels on the same land,&quot; says Righelato.

&gt; He and Spracklen conclude that if the point of biofuels policies is to
&gt; limit global warming, &quot;policy makers may be better advised in the
&gt; short term to focus on increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel use,
&gt; to conserve existing forests and savannahs, and to restore natural
&gt; forest and grassland habitats on cropland that is not needed for
&gt; food.&quot;

&gt; They do admit, however, that biofuels made from woody materials such
&gt; as prairie grasses may have an advantage over reforestation - although
&gt; it is difficult to say for now as such fuels are still in development
&gt; (see Humble grasses may be the best source of biofuel).

&gt; Forests at high latitudes have been found to sequester less carbon
&gt; than tropical forests (see Some forests may speed global warming). But
&gt; Righelato says this does not affect his calculations as biofuel crops
&gt; are not, by and large, grown in these areas.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Only because you are overly credulous.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds counterintuitive, but burning oil and planting forests to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compensate is more environmentally friendly than burning biofuel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds it because the assertion is tosh.

&gt; &gt; It all depends on the total equation. In an ideal word you are running
&gt; &gt; the thing in the most efficient manner possible, but that appears so
&gt; &gt; far to be far from being the case.

&gt; So let's change it so that it is running at as close to optimum.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say scientists who have calculated the difference in net emissions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between using land to produce biofuel and the alternative: fuelling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cars with gasoline and replanting forests on the land instead.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They did no such thing, for the simple reason that the data on which
&gt; &gt; &gt; such a thing would rest is highly volatile. How much CO2 is
&gt; &gt; &gt; sequestered by replanted forests depnds on the latitude of the forest
&gt; &gt; &gt; (tropical is better), the state of the soil and the type and variety
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the vegetation. It also ignores the other consequences of
&gt; &gt; &gt; conventional combustion -- amongst them acid rain, which destroys
&gt; &gt; &gt; forests and triggers increasing decomposition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And of course, it utterly ignores the other negative aspects of
&gt; &gt; &gt; burning gasoline -- carbon monoxide, benzine and various other nasties
&gt; &gt; &gt; being released.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But the stupidity doesn't end there regrettably ... as we shall see.

&gt; &gt; Granted that latitude, the state of soil, the type and variety of
&gt; &gt; vegetation, all do matter. It´s the total equation after all which
&gt; &gt; matters.

&gt; &gt; The problem when such ideas are presented to the world, wether it be
&gt; &gt; planting or biofuel growing, the case appears only to work when
&gt; &gt; conditions are ideal, i.e. you are running things in the most
&gt; &gt; efficient manner possible.

&gt; But you can contrive to make it so almost everywhere. Surely the aim
&gt; of all rational policy is to approach the optimum?

&gt; &gt; So far neither has been the case, i.e. CO2 recovery through
&gt; &gt; forestation hasen´t been rigorously enough calculated for the most
&gt; &gt; ideal planting scemes for every soil type to have been identified for
&gt; &gt; different latitudes,

&gt; True, although here in Australia, we have begun doing exactly this
&gt; kind of research. If this had been taken seriously 20 years ago, we'd
&gt; know a lot more by now. But now, it must be done so as to establish
&gt; sound scientific foundations on the treatment of carbon emissions.

&gt; &gt; and biofuel growing is so far nowhere nearly
&gt; &gt; being run at the greatest CO2 efficient manner possible.

&gt; Precisely why there has to be a ubiquitous cost on all carbon emitting
&gt; activities and also, a ubiquitous credit on all carbon-sequestering
&gt; activities, both based on rigorous science.

&gt; &gt; So neither sceme is yet being operated at efficiencies the ideal words
&gt; &gt; tells they are capable of.

&gt; Non sequitur. Right now, biofuel development is constrained and
&gt; predisposed by the current arrangements which are largely designed to
&gt; 'influence-peddle' rather than develop ratiobnal policy.

Indeed, the current bio fuel rage in USA appears to be a creation of
political manipulations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let's look at the mechanisms for this. If there is a fund to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;reforest&quot; plainly it can only go to those who have cut them down.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently, the plan builds in an incentive to cut them down so as
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be paid to restablish them. That's got to be stupid and utterly
&gt; &gt; &gt; ruins the model. What you really need to do is to give incentives to
&gt; &gt; &gt; protect forests and establish new ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the model assumes crude oil will always be available, when
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reality is that production is likely to decline and demand
&gt; &gt; &gt; increase, unless something else begins to bear some of the load.

&gt; &gt; Hmm, quite clearly such funds can also go to landowners who would
&gt; &gt; plant forests on their own land.

&gt; They could

&gt; &gt; Theoretically, after all we are here talking about idealized versions
&gt; &gt; of the different scemes, liquid fuel can be made out of coal, and
&gt; &gt; there is enough coal around. In addition there is oil sand.

&gt; Yes, it could, but then there would also be the other costs assoictaed
&gt; with coal mining -- release of coal gas, deaths of coal miners and
&gt; their families, emissions of other toxics to the air and waters, etc.
&gt; Burning gasoline also releases huge quanta of toxics. Extracting oil
&gt; from coal and even worse, from tar sands, is at the moment, very
&gt; energy and carbon intensive, and necessarily so, unlike biofuels.

I think though for quite some time we are stuck with coal. We really
may have to try out carbon capture scemes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it doesn't. Tractors can be operated on alcohol fuels, or as
&gt; &gt; &gt; hybrids, or as purely electric vehciles, recharged from renewable
&gt; &gt; &gt; sources.

&gt; &gt; Sure, but are they?

&gt; Yes, they are, but nowhere near as widely as they could be.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Combining c3 and c4 pathway plants radically reduces the need for
&gt; &gt; &gt; nitrogen-based fertilisers, cince c4 pathway plants -- such as rye,
&gt; &gt; &gt; switchgrass (panicum), soy -- fix nitrogen in the soil. Potassium can
&gt; &gt; &gt; be had from wastes such as &quot;vinasse&quot; (a by product of ethanol
&gt; &gt; &gt; production from sugarcane) or even wood ash. Interplanting food crops
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as corn with fuel crops such as panicum can mean both of them are
&gt; &gt; &gt; produced more efficiently in energy terms and prevent damaging run-off
&gt; &gt; &gt; into water tables. The stover from the corn can be used in
&gt; &gt; &gt; vermiculture with other organic wastes to return nutrient to the soil
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the corn mash and panicum can be used to make ethanol or other
&gt; &gt; &gt; alcohol fuels. The leftover lignin can be burned for energy or again,
&gt; &gt; &gt; returned to the soil after composting with other nutrients.

&gt; &gt; But so far they are using corn, in USA, and sugarcane, in Brasil.

&gt; Due to domestic trade policy. If Brazil is willing to sell you ethanol
&gt; chepaer than you can make it, you have two options. Find a way of
&gt; making it cheaper, or buy theirs. Right now, the US cannot produce
&gt; enough crude oil at the cost coming out of Mexico or Venezuela or the
&gt; Middle East, and so it buys it in. What's the difference?
">

Natually the trade ought to be free. However, this appears to be tied
in with the agricultural lobby in Washington.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well yes, because these studies look at corn as a monoculture. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't look at mixed planting and organic methods.

&gt; &gt; I think nobody really denies that better scemes are available than
&gt; &gt; growing corn, but corn growing to make biofuel appears to be all the
&gt; &gt; rage.

&gt; It has NOTHING to do with 'rage' and everything to do with playing

&gt; &gt; &gt; This too is a furphy. The world leader in sugar cane based ethanol
&gt; &gt; &gt; production -- Brazil, doesn't use rainforest land to produce its sugar
&gt; &gt; &gt; cane.

&gt; &gt; Think about it. The energy demands of the planet are so massive, that
&gt; &gt; if biofuel were to replase fossil fuel, cultivated land would have to
&gt; &gt; be expanded quite a bit in order to maintain food production.

&gt; That makes no sense. What you probably mean to say is that far more
&gt; arable land would have to be devoted to biofuel production, and that
&gt; this would be at the expense of land for food production. That's the
&gt; more common, (but false) claim. Is that your assertion?
">

My assertion is that it will necessiate a substantial increase of the
total land area used for cultivation by human beings on planet Earth.
That this sizeable increase of land used for cultivation will in
itself incur sizeable environmental costs of its own, though perhaps
unrelated to the issue of Global Warming.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is absurd. There is no way for the USA to grow enough corn to

&gt; &gt; Why are you so focused on corn-as-fuel? The main reason corn is

&gt; &gt; they can get it.

&gt; &gt; A price actually reflecting the cost of mitigating the harm done by
&gt; &gt; the combustion of various fuels ought to apply and be allowed to flow
&gt; &gt; through the entire economy so that eventually, rational choices could
&gt; &gt; be made about how best to respond. The US should scale down its
&gt; &gt; military since ultimately, this is in large part aimed at securing
&gt; &gt; access to crude oil at prices the US think suit its needs. This is a
&gt; &gt; subsidy and should on crude that is paid in large part with human
&gt; &gt; lioves on both sides of this conflict. It's paid by US citizens in
&gt; &gt; loss of freedom, and huge costs associated with being spied upon and
&gt; &gt; subject to unreasonable search and seizure. Right now, the US is
&gt; &gt; funding BOTH sides of the so called &quot;war on terror&quot;. This is arrant

&gt; &gt; Fully recovering carbon based waste, increasing public transport,
&gt; &gt; getting heavy goods off roads and onto rail and into ships, and so

Again, not necessarily. Contemporary car engines are configured to
burn a stoichiometrically carbon richer fuel (gasoline) to compensate
for the less thermally efficient otto cycles they use forced upon them
by the tendency of gasoline to pre-ignite and damage their engines.
Using much higher octane fuels (like ethanol) can allow a longer
stroke without running that risk. In the past, higher octane fuels
were more expensive, but ethanol (which has a RON of 129 v 91-99 for
gasoline) is cheaper to make, or at any rate, can be.

It also runs cooler, leading to longer engine life. One can actually
develop more power under load at low RPM than equivalently sized
gasoline engines.

Actually not. This is really simple market economics. Basigly if
growing ingredients for bio fuel becomes more cost effective for them,
in other words more lucrative, it becomes a real possibillity that a
fair percentage of farmers will change over from growing for food
production over to growing for the etanol mills. The inevitable result
of that will be higher food prices.

The same would happen in the third world, if biofuel growing would be
introduced there, i.e. if the farmers make more money from growing for
biofuel mills, they will change over to producing for the mills,
creating a competition for land use between biofuel growing and food
growing. The outcome of increased competition for the same amount of
land is inevitably higher prices.

The farmers will do extremelly well from such a tradeoff. But, people
one the verge of startvation really might be driven over the brink.
This is not a nonsence.

But, even so if the benefit for mankind would be really huge from
increased biofuel use, it might still be worth that humanitarian cost.

&gt; &gt; functioning society. Oil is the most dispatchable of all fuels. Cut
&gt; &gt; off oil supplies to a major country for a single day, and there's
&gt; &gt; panic and chaos. The &quot;oil crisis&quot; of the 1970s involved a 5% cut in
&gt; &gt; output and yet prices quadrupled. There was chaos on world markets.

&gt; It would not collapse the rich societies though oil supply would dry
&gt; up tomorrow and the drought would last forever.
">

Well you've changed your tune. Before, biofuels could not replace
fossil fuels, and now rich societies could avoid collapse if it were
withdrawn. Which is it?

You should note that crude oil is used not only as a general trasnport
fuel but also, massively, in petrochemicals. That keyboard you're
using is composed of petrochemicals. Your credit card? Petrochemical.
In building, refrigeration, water supply, manufacture, the use of
polymers is absolutely key, and if it's your contention that replacing
general transport fuels with biofuels is hard, then the replacement of
the petrochemical industry with bio-derived polymers is an order of
magnitude more difficult still.

If such a program is implemented in the midst of panic and over a

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, it doesn´t matter, wether it´s corn or something ellse. The USA

&gt; &gt; Never is a very long time. You should avoid making predictions
&gt; &gt; covering eternity. What you probably mean to say is that it will be a
&gt; &gt; long time before biofuels can substantially reduce US reliance on
&gt; &gt; imported crude. On the other hand, if the US made this a policy
&gt; &gt; priority, if it really believed its own rhetoric about the war on
&gt; &gt; terror being an actual war, it would begin this policy in earnest, and
&gt; &gt; personally, I've no doubt at all that it could, within 20 years, cut
&gt; &gt; its imports of crude and its current consumption by at least 25% (and
&gt; &gt; possibly as much as 50%). Of course, this would be unthinkable if it
&gt; &gt; wanted to continue swaggering about squandering its blood and treasure
&gt; &gt; (and those of other countries) as if these counted for nothing.

&gt; That would necessiate a real lot of land being put aside for that
&gt; purpose. I wonder if there is enough land available beside the land
&gt; which already is being used for food crops. If not, the two
&gt; requirements will come into a direct conflict.

There is ample land, especially if you count land regarded currently
as marginal or worse. And of course, some agricultural land is used
either to raise animals or to raise the food for animals. Moreover,
the principal pressures on land viability will come from declining
access to cheap water, changing climate, soil salinity, human
movement, inundation of low lying areas with seawater, civil war,
extreme weather such as floods and cyclones, movement of exotic fauna,
plant diseases and so forth.

You make the case. How much extra land would be required, and from
where would it come?

&gt; if

Which, under a market economy, will then move some farmers back to
producing food. Maybe if food were more expensive:

a) less of it would be wasted
b) there would be fewer tariff and non tariff barriers.

&gt; &gt; Chicken prices have doubled and milk prices are skyrocketing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nations food agencies say their cost for basic foodstuffs has doubled
&gt; &gt; &gt; due to the massive corn harvest wasted on ethanol production, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; United Nations can no longer afford to feed the world's starving
&gt; &gt; &gt; peoples.

&gt; &gt; What a joke. The big food producing countries are haggling over the
&gt; &gt; right to use trade protection measures against each other and stop
&gt; &gt; cheap food from being dumped in their markets. If there were a
&gt; &gt; shortage of food, they'd be for free trade right? Why would they
&gt; &gt; subsidise corn to win over midwestern famrers if it was in short
&gt; &gt; supply?

&gt; The same would happen in the third world, if biofuel growing would be
&gt; introduced there, i.e. if the farmers make more money from growing for
&gt; biofuel mills, they will change over to producing for the mills,
&gt; creating a competition for land use between biofuel growing and food
&gt; growing. The outcome of increased competition for the same amount of
&gt; land is inevitably higher prices.
">

But land in the third world is currently modestly priced. The reality
is that right now, the third world is importing fuel to grow food that
it can't sell for an adequate price on world markets, and this has so
distorted their economies as fuel prices have soared that they can no
longer afford to buy it without cutting back on .... food production
which requires fuel. In places like Uganda they have largely run their
meagre economy on diesel fuel, but now they can no longer afford to
import it in adequate quantities and since they were using it to
supply power this is leading to patchy power supply -- so patchy that
they can't pump the oil from Nigeria consistently. Someone estimated
that their diesel bill could have bought them two hydroelectric dams.
Now they are about to build such a dam with world bank funds on Lake
Victoria which will not only ruin the native environment but wipe out
a part of their tourism industry.

Had they been producing biodiesel from algae, this could have been
avoided.

&gt; The farmers will do extremelly well from such a tradeoff. But, people

It is a nonsense. Whether one is better importing food or fuel depends
on which costs you more. If you import subsidised food (as you can at
the moment, since the Europeans and the Americans are doing this) and
stop importing/import less non-subsidised oil, then you are ahead. In
fact, since you have cash, you can buy foods that you can't have at
home.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But, even so if the benefit for mankind would be really huge from
&gt; increased biofuel use, it might still be worth that humanitarian cost.

There's no humanitarian cost. If people earn a living raising
biofuels, or using biofuels to raise crops then their needs are met.
The key question is about how these benefits are distributed. Biofuels
lend themselves far better to equity than crude oil extraction.
