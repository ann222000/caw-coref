Whatever works best for the game you want to play, whatever works best
for the game you want to play, and here, respectively.

We can't be of more help until you give us a few more hints to go on...

Those questions can't be answered without knowing more about what your
play group wants.

&quot;What tech level&quot; should be reasonably easy to determine, once you
decide what your setting is. Knowing the setting, simply look up the
tech level chart in the &quot;Campaigns&quot; book of the Basic Set and choose
one that approximates the level of technology of the setting. If your
setting treats technology unusually, read the surrounding text to
tweak the tech level parameters for your chosen setting.

&quot;How many points&quot; (I don't see why you're shouting it) is answerable
once you make up a few sample characters for the setting. Construct
some representative characters that you want to see in the setting,
without regard for a point limit, and count up the point totals. That
will give you a good guide to how many points to allow for the PCs.

This is the newsgroup rec.games.frp.gurps, which is a fine forum to
discuss GURPS. Especially so since it's not limited to a single site.

100 works very well at that tech level, but 75 is a great challenge.

A very powerful tool, but not the only tool. And if only that which
could be verified scientifically was considered real, then nearly all
of human experience would be not-real.                  -- Zachriel
