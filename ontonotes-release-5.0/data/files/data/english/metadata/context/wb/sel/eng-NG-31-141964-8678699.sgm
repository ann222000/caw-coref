Guessing this explains the design that looks like a 'amazon.com wanna-
be'.

Usabiilty folks - if you want more exposure on the cds - put them up
towards the top.  Make it easier to scroll, make it accessible....

Your color scheme sucks, no alt tags for the image buttons (so a blind
person knows these are buttons but have to click to find out where
they go).

Font on buttons too small, and centered?  Why?  To the left there is
no clear visual way to separate content other than using Bold
lettering... one would hope that everything was new, does putting new
beside it some how mean everything else is old?

Biggest usability issue - regardless of how popular you are, you need
a better tag line at the top to define your business - Quality, Value,
Convenience says nothing about the website... need a bit more...

Too much white space and stop echoing the links at the bottom - that
is sooo 10 years ago. Contact informtion at the bottom ?  OOoo good
choice... make us work for it.

Too much white space... the biggest complaint? There websites design
does not pull the content together, marry it so to speak.... they need
to either do ovals or squares... Use two major colors, two
complimentary and two neutral...

Photos - the Host Picks is good, center one is good and they need more
like these that 'fill' the square (no white space).  I do like the top
navigation (way it works).

Poor use of Spotlight ... very tiny, easy to miss..

Do this:

1.  list your major categories
2.  list your sub categories under
3.  now check THE most important things in your website (these need to
be echoed on the main page)
4.  Now - this is three columns... so draw a page with three columns
(wider in center)
5.  I recommend they use a fixed width website and a nice background
6.  take your categories - note what can push down and what cannot
(i.e mission statment will never push down but news/events do)
7.  Your items that do not push go at top
8.  Your items that DO push down, go at bottom or to right column (my
preference)
9.  Highlighted items - should go in top region, I'd recommend the
Spotlight be a nice photo with an icon or something to draw attention
to it being a spotlight and top right.

Organize your site in blocks - on paper.  Categories, subs.  What can
push down, what cannot... I recommend two columns, left and right
(smaller).  BIG photo to left, spotlight to right.  Specials left but
done ... differently... video previews under - darker region woudl
still work.. and community/other links to right.

Seriously - if it is not important to the site, do not put it on the
main page. The main page is touch points...

sorry long winded....
