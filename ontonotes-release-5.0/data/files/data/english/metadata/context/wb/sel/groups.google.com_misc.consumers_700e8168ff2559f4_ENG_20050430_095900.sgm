Obesity May Raise Risk of Stillbirth, Infant Death
Fri Apr 29, 2005 02:00 PM ET

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Women who are obese before becoming pregnant
seem to have a higher risk of stillbirth and of having an infant die soon
after birth, according to a new study.
The study of more than 24,000 Danish women found that, compared with
normal-weight women, those who were obese before pregnancy had twice the
risk of stillbirth and to have a baby die within a month, according to
findings published in the British Journal of Gynecology.

For all of the women, regardless of weight, stillbirths and newborn deaths
were relatively uncommon. Among obese women, stillbirths occurred at a rate
of less than 12 per 1,000 births, and the rate of newborn death was lower
still, at about 7 per 1,000 births.

But the figures compare with a stillbirth rate of 4 per 1,000 births among
normal-weight women, and a newborn death rate of less than 3 for every
1,000 births.

Women who were overweight but not obese had risks comparable to those of
normal-weight women, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Janni
Kristensen of Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark.

&quot;Our data suggest that obesity is associated with a marked increased risk
of stillbirth and neonatal deaths,&quot; the study authors write, &quot;emphasizing
the need for public health interventions to prevent obesity in young
women.&quot;

The study is not the first to link obesity to greater odds of stillbirth
and newborn death. In the past, researchers have found that the risks may
be partially explained by the higher rates of diabetes and high blood
pressure seen in overweight pregnant women.

But in this study, diabetes and high blood pressure were not key factors,
according to Kristensen's team. When the researchers excluded women with
either of the two disorders from their analysis, the risks of stillbirth
and newborn death linked to obesity remained essentially unchanged.

Overall, the investigators found, no single cause of stillbirth or newborn
death explained the higher rates among obese women. Compared with their
normal-weight and overweight counterparts, obese women had a higher rate of
stillbirths classified as &quot;unexplained,&quot; and problems with the placenta
--which transfers oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood to the fetus
--were more common.

Exactly why obesity may raise the risk of stillbirth and early infant death
is not clear, but the Danish researchers point out that obesity is known to
affect the hormonal system and the metabolism of blood fats. High
cholesterol, they note, may affect certain substances in the body that
control blood clotting and blood vessel dilation, and thereby impair blood
flow to the placenta.

While the ultimate goal is to prevent obesity in the first place, the
researchers add that fetal and newborn deaths could potentially be reduced
by referring more obese women to obstetricians who specialize in high-risk
pregnancies.

I bet if they checked apple-shaped obese women would be the ones with
the increased risk because of increased endocrine abnormalities.

I thought with respect to both the conditions you mention that the
medical community's consensus was that lifestyle factors had modest
implications at best for outcome -- which of course means a study would
be able to point to a correlation between obesity and hypertension, for
example, if the study was large enough. But correlation is not
causation.

I think it has been found to be true of most lifestyle issues (apart
from smoking) that the amount of control which lifestyle modifications
gains you is modest at best, and assuming people will develop or will
not develop any given condition based on their lifestyle factors is
generally a bad idea because of that. IOW, people who get Type II
diabetes are sometimes overweight, and sometimes they're not, and what
they *do* all have in common is a set of genes which predispose them to
both the outcome &quot;overweight&quot; and the outcome &quot;diabetic&quot; (and the
outcome &quot;gestational diabetic&quot;, for that matter.)

"/>  How about Japan in the 1970's? How old did people get there, and how
few of the people there got Type II diabetes, and how few got coronary
heart disease regardless of genes?

Oh, and in the USA hypertension has enough different causes from
lifestyle that removing one lifestyle cause can easily fail to stop
hypertension.
How many people are hypertensive while getting adequate aerobic
exercise, not smoking, not being overweight and consuming no more
than 1,000 mg of sodium per day? (That 2400 mg/day is &quot;realpolitik&quot;
barely to hardly safe for most and excessive for all too many.)
How many people that don't smoke, are not overweight, get adequate
aerobic exercise, and have diets adequately low in fats in general,
saturated fats and trans fats, and avoid high blood pressure (with low
sodium intake if necessary in addition to other good lifestyle factors,
medication failing that) get coronary heart disease?

Some people have genes good enough to live dangerously in terms of diet
and/or lack of exercise. When genes are on the bad side, this usually
does not doom someone to dying young but merely requiring more strongly
healthy lifestyle.

"/> I don't know. But I do know that my mom and grandmother do water
aerobics three times a week and work out on the other days, don't
smoke, weigh less than 140 lbs at 5'-9&quot; each, and eat wholly vegetarian
low-salt diets, and take both beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers to keep their blood pressure barely below the morbid range.
My grandmother also takes Lipitor. I would, at a bare minimum, say
that there are genetic risk factors which can trump lifestyle in some
cases.

However, the &quot;two conditions&quot; I refered to are pregnancy-induced
hypertension (which is not the same disease as essential hypertension)
and gestational diabetes -- and it is my understanding that lifestyle
modifications during pregnancy will do little or nothing to prevent the
onset of those two diseases. I presented during pregnancy with severe
pre-eclampsia despite having none of the risk factors for
pregnancy-related hypertension or pre-eclampsia apart from that strong
family history of hypertension. When I got pregnant I was a hiker
(good cardio system) of normal weight. I have been told that my
symptoms were most likely caused by an inherited overactive immune
system which inflamed my blood vessels in response to &quot;just about
anything&quot; although in that particular case, it was in response to a
fetus with a different genetic makeup than me. My blood pressure was
220/116 on admission; it is currently (non-pregnant) 105/65. But my
relatives experienced onset of primary hypertension in their late 40s
and I am not yet that age.

Here are the risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Australians:

smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, low fruit consumption, low vegetable
consumption, high alcohol consumption, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
and diabetes.

Now how would your community know whether your deceased neighbour ate enough
fruit/vegies? Or what his cholesterol/blood sugar level was? We often
perceive that a person is healthy without that actually being the case.

"/> It's probably not the exercise, per se.
It's most likely the exercise caused newly-formed (vulnerable) plaque to
rupture. This plaque contains powerful coagulants.

Very sad, imo, when a cardiologist thinks the most important question is
_understanding why_ they rupture. Just came from my Think Tank
(bathroom) a few minutes ago. I decided the most important thing would
be to take something already known to stabilize plaque. Simple &amp; cheap
vitamin C, according to our radio doc (Real MD).

Cardiovascular Institute at Mount Sinai School of Med in NY has
suggested that we begin to look in the direction of vulnerable plaque,
inflammation, physical activity and diet, genes, cholesterol levels, and
education.

Further, Daniel Q. Haney of the AP stated that &quot;Medicine’s understanding
of what causes heart attacks is being rewritten.&quot; The article goes on to
say that vulnerable plaque, something that cardiologists can’t see, is
responsible for 85% of all heart attacks. Dr. Steven Nissen of the
Cleveland Clinic then adds &quot;The rupture of a plaque will be the cause of
death of about half of all of us in the United States. Understanding why
they rupture is probably the most important question today in cardiology
and even the most important question in the country.&quot; (See Vulnerable
Plaque, The Latest in Heart Disease? by Haney)

&gt;&gt; Don't suppose they consider the fact that overweight women receive
&gt;&gt; different
&gt;&gt; care than &quot;normal&quot; weigh women in many practices, with doctors telling
&gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt; not to gain too much weight, telling them they're at risk for more
&gt;&gt; complications, etc... Too bad you can't double-blind this to study
&gt;&gt;&quot;weight-blind&quot; care vs. &quot;weight sensitive&quot; care to see if simply the
&gt;&gt; stress
&gt;&gt; of being cared for as an obese woman might add to the morbidity of the
&gt;&gt; pg.

&gt; Remember it was done in Denmark, and their care of pg women is likely to
&gt; be
&gt; different to the care you received.

"/> lol.... there are very few women in the US who get the kind of care I had
this pg.

&gt; low-salt diets, and take both beta blockers and calcium channel
&gt; blockers to keep their blood pressure barely below the morbid range.
&gt; My grandmother also takes Lipitor. I would, at a bare minimum, say
&gt; that there are genetic risk factors which can trump lifestyle in some
&gt; cases.

"/> Morbid, Schmorbid! An old trick. They lowered the bar (as was done with
cholesterol) &amp; mfg'd more patients.

New book, claims you can feed your genes:

ps: I wouldn't take Lipitor for any length of time, if they were free.
A former NASA Flight Surgeon wrote book: &quot;Lipitor: Thief of Memory&quot;
(amazingly, he had enuf memory to write a book..??)
