Hi there I have a 99 wrangler I am looking to installing a pair of
manual locking hubs in the front axle.(dana 30)
And wanted to know how hard it was to install? And are manual locking
hubs the same as manual locking lockers? I am new to some of this
stuff as you may see.

Thanks Jamie any help would be very nice

Are you looking to get a 2 wheel drive low range or for a couple extra mpg?

All the hub locks do is allow the front wheels to freewheel vs turning
the axles as it does now.

Wear and tear is debatable.  U-joints that sit tend to rust, spinning
ones stay lubed usually.

I get a couple mpg less when driving with the hubs locked.

You will need to swap your hub, spindle and axles out.  I don't know if
you can do that and even keep the rims you now have either.  A CJ setup
has a different wheel rim bolt measurement.

Why? Are the auto locking hubs broken? No, a locker is a different
animal. So, which do you want to install? A locker system for your axle,
or locking hubs?

The conversion kits run $800.00 plus, and you may have to have your stock
wheel's center hole machined to fit over the new hub. It's your money but if
you want to spend it to upgrade your Jeep I'd look at something else, like a
winch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You'd be taking apart the front axle, replace the axleshafts, install new
spindles, bearings and such, installing new hubs.

And are manual locking

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No. A &quot;locker&quot; is a locking differential, which positively locks together
the axleshafts inside the differential in low-traction situations. A manual
locker does this with a lever or switch, an automatic locker does it, well,
automatically.

It's a similar concept as a limited-slip differential, but not the same, as
an LSD will allow some slippage and differentiation.

Yep that is a Chysler trade mark, not only remove the lockut hubs but
also make it a expensive and painfull process to do so. Chysler came
up with those bastard hubs in 73 and used them 73 to 79 on full time
4x4's then then brought it back in late 80's on some models (now it is
on every 4x4 they make) and forced it on to Jeeps too.

Thanks all of you. I was not sure if the hubs were the same as lockers
or not. I have a warn m8000 winch. I was looking at a few MPG more and
2 Wheel low would also be nice. How munch would it cost to get it
installed? And does anyone know of a cheap good hubs I can get? I also
have a extra pair of rims around here for the jeep. They said they
were from a 87 YJ. They are 15 inch The rims I have now are from a
2005 jeep I was told and are 16 inch. I will have to get new tires it
looks like to.

First off, you're not going to recoup your investment in putting manual
hubs on just to save a squirt or two of gas on the rare occasion you
will be in 2LO. Especially if that's the only reason you're removing
your auto hubs. If you're in LOW, you probably want 4WD, at least where
I roll you do. Please explain your reasoning for the hub change.

Secondly, you will need wheels with a centerbore for a manual 4WD hub.
You won't find any YJ or TJ wheels that fit that bill. If you can hang
with 15&quot; tires, you will have more options and find cheaper tires.

You will need to find out what the hubs take for rims.  They changed the
bolt pattern in 86/87.

I would use google and search for conversion kits.

Actualy 2lo is doable. There should be a vacum disconnet on front
axle housing on passanger side by diff. It you &quot;switch&quot; disable it,
the front axle would not full engage. Like other posters said it is
not cost effective to convert to hubs. Actually the &quot;cheapest way to
do it would be to swap in a complete older axle with hubs as it would
be cheaper than buying kits and it would be easier to swap axle than
instal  hub kit too.

I knew they did that but was not sure when they switched over. There
simply is no excuse for them to sell Jeeps of that type that way just
to save a few bucks building them. Chysler has not done Jeep any
favors on this.

No, locking hubs and lockers are not the same.

You need a locker, you do not need locking hubs.

I believe Jerry Bransford who used to frequent this group had an automatic
locker installed in his front axle w/o manual hubs and had no ill effects.
The locker will disengage in turns when one wheel spins faster than the
other, and as you shouldn't be in 4x4 on pavement, there would be no power
delivered to the front wheels, so there should be no chirping or pulling. Or
if you had a manual locker, you would just have it disengaged on pavement.

No. You would only feel the locker in 4WD. It 2WD, a locker is transparent.

I drive a CJ5 with a Detroit EZLocker in the front, and I leave my front
hubs locked about 99% of the time. I unlocked them a few times for long
trips on the freeway, but a general rule I leave them locked all of the
time. My hubs locked and the front of your TJ is the same condition.

The difference is that the TJ has no ability to unlock the front hubs, your
kid's YJ uses a vacuum system to disconnect the front tires from the axle.
The TJ front axles and tires are connected all of the time.

Having said that, in 2WD, the condition of the connection between the tires
and the axle is a non-issue.

Well if I could only feel the locker in 4wd. I guess i will just skip
doing the manual locking hubs and get the 4 inch lift instead. They
are about the same price. Do any of you know how a 4 inch lift kit
will handle with 31 inch tires? Thanks Jamie

For my money, the best lift is 2.5&quot;, and 1&quot; of body lift. This will let you
run 32s (I use 32x11.50s) or 33s (Mike Romain runs 33x9.50s, and swears they
are the best thing since sliced bread).

4&quot; of lift is far more than most people need, but if you are going with that
much, you should be thinking more rubber. 31s will look very small with that
lift.
