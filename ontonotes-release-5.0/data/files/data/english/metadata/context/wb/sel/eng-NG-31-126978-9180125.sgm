Step aside Moore and Taylor. Welcome Garcia and Rodriguez.

Smith remains the most common surname in the United States, according to
a new analysis released yesterday by the Census Bureau. But for the first
time, two Hispanic surnames — Garcia and Rodriguez — are among the top 10
most common in the nation, and Martinez nearly edged out Wilson for 10th
place.

The number of Hispanics living in the United States grew by 58 percent in
the 1990s to nearly 13 percent of the total population, and cracking the
list of top 10 names suggests just how pervasively the Latino migration
has permeated everyday American culture.

Garcia moved to No. 8 in 2000, up from No. 18, and Rodriguez jumped to
No. 9 from 22nd place. The number of Hispanic surnames among the top 25
doubled, to 6.

Compiling the rankings is a cumbersome task, in part because of
confidentiality and accuracy issues, according to the Census Bureau, and
it is only the second time it has prepared such a list. While the
historical record is sketchy, several demographers said it was probably
the first time that any non-Anglo name was among the 10 most common in
the nation. “It’s difficult to say, but it’s probably likely,” said
Robert A. Kominski, assistant chief of social characteristics for the
census.

Luis Padilla, 48, a banker who has lived in Miami since he arrived from
Colombia 14 years ago, greeted the ascendance of Hispanic surnames
enthusiastically.

“It shows we’re getting stronger,” Mr. Padilla said. “If there’s that
many of us to outnumber the Anglo names, it’s a great thing.”

I say anyone who enters america should be forced to adopt an american

That sounds like a racist remark to me.
