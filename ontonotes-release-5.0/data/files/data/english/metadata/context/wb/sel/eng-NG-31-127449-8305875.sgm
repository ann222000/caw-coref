Movie review: &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954), the sort of review
you can read if you don't plan to watch the film:

Apparently this is the first CinemaScope film done outside the US. It
certainly is w i d e. Their heads are chopped off and you can see over
into the next county. There is a such thing as too much w i d e.

Three women toss coins in a fountain, one doesn't but she's part of the
party, and this is supposed to bring them love in Italy. But every guy
that hits on them, they treat rudely. Perhaps the guys deserve it, my
Italian isn't up to telling.

There seems to be a reoccurring theme of a truck that doesn't have any
brakes, they use passengers to slow themselves down. They can't
understand why there are so many accidents in Rome. This is a common
idea in 1950s American films about Italy.

We inevitably get to see the truck race down a hill with Anita  who
&quot;just couldn't get it in gear.&quot; Naturally she lives and the hot blooded
Roman takes a pass at her, he's in &quot;love&quot;. Didn't he just meet her five
minutes ago?

Meanwhile the other two girls end up taking a flight to Venice with
another hot blooded Roman who apparently isn't hot enough to deal with
having both of them around at the same time.

Now the management is mad that the three American girls are hanging
around with the hot blooded Romans but the new American girl is able to
explain that no one has actually done anything &quot;wrong&quot;. Concern now
exists that perhaps she's &quot;seeing a doctor&quot;, if you know what I mean.

At this point, Anita  is crying because she's been confronted about
&quot;seeing the doctor&quot;, there is no doctor, and the boy she kissed is fired
for fraternizing with the Americans girls. The situation seems pretty
bleak. Everyone is in a huff.

Wait a minute, Anita  and Georgio are together in the same house now.
Apparently even though he's fired and she's going back to America, her
truck with no brakes crash has sparked something. She's focusing mostly
though on trying to get him his job back but I think she's hot for him.

I was right, they are kissing. Geez, kissing on the bed. No, stop, he's
worried that he's lost his job and he can't provide for her. But she
doesn't care. And she's not really leaving to go to America because
she's going to get married, there's no one, she just lied to get out of
the insane agency that doesn't let the American girls date the hot
blooded Italian help.

The new American girl is so worried that she caused Georgio to lose his
job by telling the boss that Anita spent the weekend with the hot
Italian help that she's thinking up ways beyond what she's already
tried, basically begging the boss to hire the hot blooded Italian guy
back.

The new American girl is going to see if she can learn enough art,
&quot;Neo-impressionism&quot;, to impress the hot blooded Italian guy with the
airplane and maybe meet his mother because that is &quot;the first step to
the altar&quot;. She's &quot;mad about Neo-impressionism&quot; although she doesn't
know what room it's in.

His quizzing of her on Neo-impressionism is forcing her to attempt to
sound like she knows what Neo-impressionism is. I'm wondering whether
she's hot enough for the hot blooded Italian guy who likes art even if
she says stupid things about art. Apparently she is. Especially after
she lies and claims she's 3/4 Italian, and after she preps with the
waiter to figure out what sort of food and wine he likes, with others to
see what sort of opera he likes, etc. Rossini.

After all this, she's falling asleep at the opera. I bet she's not so
hip on the food either. How would you film that? She could find out he
likes sushi and she hates it like George Bush's dad, uuuurp.

She is going after him on the meal, Saltimbocca alla Romana, and he's
convinced they agree on everything. So of course he's taking her to see
his mother. I expect, and this is pretty obvious, that when he figures
out she's been jerking him around, there'll be trouble.

This is getting things in deeper as he's telling her that he can trust
her entirely, she's like him more than anyone else ever... Oh no, she's
decided to tell it all. This is too quick. I can't keep up! She made a
record about everything about him and she pretended to like things he
liked. It's shocking. She's sorry. He's in a huff. They drive off. End
of scene.

Now Anita and the two other American girls are together and two of them
are discussing Georgio. Turns out that it won't work out and she's
crying her little eyes out about it. So we are at the point in these
movies where all the relationships are screwed up.

Both Georgio's girl and the new American girl, the one who lied to the
hot blooded Italian guy, are going back to America. For some reason some
fat Italian woman is bringing the remaining American woman a white cat.
This doesn't seem to solace the remaining American woman until the cat
crawls out and finds her for a snuggle. How cute. She's decided to go
back to American too.

I think I see something. The guy who writes, that has her as a
secretary, asks her to marry him based on &quot;respect&quot; because, you know,
the Chinese marry people they've never met. Of course she's in love with
him, always has been it seems. I suspect this marriage is going to
somehow prevent the other two American girls from leaving.

This is unbelievable. The writer guy goes to the doctor and finds out
he's going to die. Not die at some unspecified later time but instead
soon enough that the marriage might be a problem. She's waited 15 years
and now this!?

He's planning to have his body shipped to America. I've learned from
other 1950s movies about shipping bodies from Italy to America. He's
called off the wedding without telling her, BTW. That's pretty mean.
She's crying. End of scene.

Now the dying guy is going on a walk-about, a last look at Rome. He raps
his cane on the table, he wants a bottle of scotch but they don't do
that. He orders six double scotches lined up. She's learned what is
going on and he claims he's going to face things sensibly, with the six
drinks. So she orders six drinks too. Good grief. She drinks one and
gags. She ends up in the fountain up to her neck with the dying guy
trying to help her out. Of course after they've both had the six drinks,
I'm not sure. No, wait, they are at home and have a headache.

Instead of sleeping, she's going to try to help the other two American
girls find their prince, at least one. No wait, she is going to sleep.
Dying guy gives her a little kiss. Oh gee. End of scene.

Back with lied to guy, dying guy arrives. They discuss marriage. Lied to
guy is not so happy because he's been lied to. All of Rome knows about
all of this. Dying guy is conning lied to guy into getting back with the
new American girl.

Lied to guy is set to thinking and dying guy heads to his next stop. I
suspect this is the other hot blooded Italian guy. When you are the
dying guy, you always have time to play matchmaker when your
secretary/wife to be is drunk off her ass.

The two American girls are now at the fountain where everything started.
The fountain has no water in it because they are cleaning it. They are
concerned about getting a refund for their fountain coin toss. No, look,
the fountain is coming to life again. The music starts in the
background, the lied to guy arrives with a smile on his face. From the
other direction, the other guy, the fired guy, arrives. Both girls
embrace, lying girl to lied to hot blooded Italian guy, and got him
fired girl to fired hot blooded Italian guy. Dying guy is hanging out
with his secretary/wife. We go to credits.

I suspect everyone needs some Saltimbocca alla Romana:
