Sounds Good, i just finished work and am off out on the bike to get me a
copy,
I am looking forward to giving it a listen. Over here in the UK Mojo
magazine
has a Pink Floyd cover article  and the cover CD has music which is either
an influence on or was influenced by The Pink Floyd and it's pretty good

I got it and it is done fairly well, they have used some limiting to
maximize volume but the Mono source is legit having compared it to my
UK Mono LP

It is very nicely done.  I've compared against the UK mono as well, and it's
authentic.  I'm not sure if they re-EQd, or if it comes down to the
difference between formats.  (The end of &quot;Flaming&quot; isn't cut off either, as
was the case with the '97 reish.)

That said, the mono mix is slightly overcompressed.  One channel is slightly
higher at times, and the peaks do clip out on occasion.  It's not a huge
problem, but in an archival package such as this it shouldn't happen at all.
I think they've presented the original mix, but not the original dynamics.

The stereo mix is also a bit overcompressed and unnecessarily loud. I
haven't got a vinyl pressing, but the drums 30 seconds into Astronomy
Domine are louder than on the previous CD version and since the whole
thing is mastered loud, this causes some clipping.

It's also a pity that the two tracks from Tonite Let's All Make Love
In London aren't included but I would guess that's due to legal
issues, and most Pink Floyd fanatics will have these already. I rate
them as the most essential non-LP tracks, togther with the first two
singles.

I wasn't mad about the packaging, and thought the pages from Syd's
notebook were a pointless inclusion. I'm curious, did anyone find them
interesting?

Grumbling aside, this is definitely the best PF release to grace the
CD format yet. For that we should be grateful.

your criticism is fair, i think. i was glad to have 'matilda mother'
w/original belloc-lifted verses.  i heard a live version of that orig.
vers. somewhere and it sounded really snotty, very punk-psych.  i like
the inclusion 'fart enjoy' a lot because it brings into play even more
&quot;sydness.&quot;

I noticed on headphones that one channel cuts out a bit on the stereo
Interstellar Overdrive. This is distressing.

The 2cd's stacked on each other is kind of annoying, as you have to
remove both to get to the 3rd CD.

I dropped the package ONCE and the booklet ripped the 3 staples from
the spine. Such is life.

What's with the blank page in Syd's booklet, left blank for &quot;legal
reasons?&quot; What could be a legal matter in a booklet called FART ENJOY?

wrote lots of graffiti.

I really like it too. The new mono disc trounces the 30th anniversary,
and the 3rd disc great as well. I like the cover,  but the rest of the
packaging sucks, and I didn't get much out of the insert. But the
music is the important part, and this is a must-have.

Hell - there's a three disc version? I bought this last week at my
local store - didn't know it was out even or contemplated - just
grabbed it, but mine only has TWO discs and no Syd stuff at all. I've
been enjoying it a lot, but now I have to buy another version, I
guess. Crap!

At least they put it out. That's the best thing this consumer can say
right now, I'm afraid ;)

Take it straight back to the store with your receipt and any packaging.
You have statutory consumer rights and can exchange any goods such as CD's,
providing they are in mint condition, up to 30 days from purchase.
Any retailer should not have a problem with this, particularly when you wish
to exchange for a more expensive product, which in this case it is.
We, in my record shop do this quite often, but I'm hoping you've not made
any creases etc on the sleeve, otherwise, tough, sorry, no-can-do.

?  I&quot;ve never heard of such a thing with cds - unless they're
defective, most stores will not accept returns of opened merchandise.
It would be a great policy for record stores to have, but it seems
highly unusual to me..

I did notice there is a standard &quot;non cloth'cover version with only 2
cd's (stereo and mono) but
no 3rd disc..it was at chapters here in canada..and the 3 disc version
is $15.00 extra and they
have to special order it. Is this what you purchased..does it have a
normal paper cover, or cloth?

Well, all I can say Jeff, is that you have now.
Have you never come across the &quot;suck it &amp; see&quot; marketing policy operated by
some of the large chain stores?
where if you don't like the record, you can swap for something else - but
just once, for obvious reasons.
I don't openly operate such a policy at my shop, but the big-guys more or
less have to these days, what with massive reductions in across the counter
sales due to on-line purchasing &amp; downloading.
(quite why anyone would want to buy a download, if frankly beyond me.)

Did you know that here in the UK, the average annual expenditure per
household on music products is a lousy 18 pounds or 36 bucks. And we have
the highest average in Europe!
It really is desperate, but I'll be trading long after the big-guys have bit
the dust, simply because I know my customers and look after them.
Does Tower do that? Nope.

Tower bit the dust a few months ago.
The first chain store I used in North Beach (SF) when i first moved
up here.
Tower always took my returns with no problem.
I shop for 80% of my music at Amoeba and Rasputon Record stores
respectively in Berkeley.
No problem there as long as you keep the receipt and decide in 7 days
to return.
Any defect or missing disc they straight up do ya right.

God my first Record store down in Los Angeles was Moby Disc Records
Those were fun days starting up my record collection

i wasn't going to pick up the 40th anniv patgod but when i saw it at
amoeba on haight street, in s.f., i had to.  i must say that the pics of
syd they chose are strange and i do like the 'fart enjoy' book, though i
wish they didn't lop off the last page.  and i really liked  the matilda
mother w/the original hilaire belloc lyrics.

there was some doc i saw ... maybe via a youtube link that inlcuded the
hilaire belloc lyrics version of 'matilda mother,' live.  they were
tight as a drum and syd sang those lyrics in a really great snotty sort
of way.  psych punk.  i must find it.

does anyone know anything about this particular live version?  it's much
different from the one included in 40th anniv patgod.

Tower, oh yes I had pleasure in seeing them off here a few years ago.
Extortionate prices and they deserved to go down.
More recently Fopp, too, but some of their stores have been saved and
re-opened by HMV, keeping the Fopp name, but their prices have increased.

Long Live the Independents!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hell - there's a three disc version? I bought this last week at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local store - didn't know it was out even or contemplated - just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grabbed it, but mine only has TWO discs and no Syd stuff at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been enjoying it a lot, but now I have to buy another version, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guess. Crap!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least they put it out. That's the best thing this consumer

&gt;&gt; Tower bit the dust a few months ago.
&gt;&gt; The first chain store I used in North Beach (SF) when i first moved
&gt;&gt; up here.
&gt;&gt; Tower always took my returns with no problem.
&gt;&gt; I shop for 80% of my music at Amoeba and Rasputon Record stores
&gt;&gt; respectively in Berkeley.
&gt;&gt; No problem there as long as you keep the receipt and decide in 7 days
&gt;&gt; to return.
&gt;&gt; Any defect or missing disc they straight up do ya right.

&gt;&gt; God my first Record store down in Los Angeles was Moby Disc Records

Well I was talking more of the 1970s and 1980s Tower.
When vinyl was 2.99 3.99 4.99 +++
tickets to Winterland 3,50 4.50 5.50
a glass of beer at Specs was 75 cents
Roosevelt was president
ha
ok
sorry

They had shows in the parking lot. Saw Willie Nelson/Boz Scagga/The
Clash/
Talking Heads/ Garcia and Merl Saunders/  Paul Kanter and on and on
all a hazy memory in many ways
Did not really keep up since I moved out of North Beach.

I agree on the Independents.
Sadly Mill Valley Music is closing this month after 30 40??  +++ years
A tough racket these days with downloads  and kids really not caring
about the album but
the latest song they can download and add to their pile on their
computer and Ipod.

There are still a couple/few/more around SF and Oakland and Berkeley

Hail to you guys that care

Ha, Ha! That's what I feel like these days. When I lived in Boston the whole
area was riddled with indie record stores. Going to a chain store never even
crossed my mind. I could barely even make it to all the indies in the same
month! Now about half of them are gone. I moved about 20 miles out of town
about seven years ago, and I barely ever get to any record stores at all. I
miss the hell out of those days.

tell me about it
in the paper today they named North Beach one of the  best
neighborhoods to live in
I've been In Oakland for a years, with a huge warehouse
but I miss the days too
when i go back, no parking and all the old record stores are gone
but a million cafes and yuppies
still has the flavor though

but time travels on

memories are made of this

&gt; &gt;&gt; Tower bit the dust a few months ago.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The first chain store I used in North Beach (SF) when i first moved
&gt; &gt;&gt; up here.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Tower always took my returns with no problem.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I shop for 80% of my music at Amoeba and Rasputon Record stores
&gt; &gt;&gt; respectively in Berkeley.
&gt; &gt;&gt; No problem there as long as you keep the receipt and decide in 7
&gt; days
&gt; &gt;&gt; to return.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Any defect or missing disc they straight up do ya right.

&gt; &gt;&gt; God my first Record store down in Los Angeles was Moby Disc Records
&gt; &gt;&gt; Those were fun days starting up my record collection

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hell - there's a three disc version? I bought this last week
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at my
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local store - didn't know it was out even or contemplated -
&gt; just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grabbed it, but mine only has TWO discs and no Syd stuff at
&gt; all.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been enjoying it a lot, but now I have to buy another
&gt; version, I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guess. Crap!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least they put it out. That's the best thing this consumer

All you gotta do is say it's defective and hide the other copies, you'll
then get store credit and can buy whatever.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hell - there's a three disc version? I bought this last week
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local store - didn't know it was out even or contemplated -
&gt; &gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grabbed it, but mine only has TWO discs and no Syd stuff at
&gt; &gt; &gt; all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been enjoying it a lot, but now I have to buy another version,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guess. Crap!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least they put it out. That's the best thing this consumer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right now, I'm afraid ;)

&gt;&gt; Ha, Ha! That's what I feel like these days. When I lived in Boston
&gt;&gt; the whole area was riddled with indie record stores. Going to a
&gt;&gt; chain store never even crossed my mind. I could barely even make
&gt;&gt; it to all the indies in the same month! Now about half of them are
&gt;&gt; gone. I moved about 20 miles out of town about seven years ago,
&gt;&gt; and I barely ever get to any record stores at all. I miss the hell
&gt;&gt; out of those days.

&gt;&gt; They had shows in the parking lot. Saw Willie Nelson/Boz Scagga/The

&gt;&gt; Did not really keep up since I moved out of North Beach.

&gt;&gt; I agree on the Independents.
&gt;&gt; Sadly Mill Valley Music is closing this month after 30 40?? +++ years
&gt;&gt; A tough racket these days with downloads and kids really not caring

&gt;&gt; the latest song they can download and add to their pile on their

&gt;&gt; There are still a couple/few/more around SF and Oakland and Berkeley

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tower bit the dust a few months ago.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The first chain store I used in North Beach (SF) when i first
&gt;&gt; moved
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; up here.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tower always took my returns with no problem.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I shop for 80% of my music at Amoeba and Rasputon Record stores
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; respectively in Berkeley.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No problem there as long as you keep the receipt and decide in
&gt;&gt; 7 days
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to return.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any defect or missing disc they straight up do ya right.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; God my first Record store down in Los Angeles was Moby Disc
&gt;&gt; Records
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Those were fun days starting up my record collection

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Have you never come across the &quot;suck it &amp; see&quot; marketing policy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; operated by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; some of the large chain stores?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; where if you don't like the record, you can swap for something
&gt;&gt; else
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; - but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; just once, for obvious reasons.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't openly operate such a policy at my shop, but the big-guys
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; less have to these days, what with massive reductions in
&gt;&gt; across the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; counter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sales due to on-line purchasing &amp; downloading.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (quite why anyone would want to buy a download, if frankly beyond
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; me.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Did you know that here in the UK, the average annual
&gt;&gt; expenditure per
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; household on music products is a lousy 18 pounds or 36 bucks. And
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; we have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the highest average in Europe!
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It really is desperate, but I'll be trading long after the big-
&gt;&gt; guys
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have bit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the dust, simply because I know my customers and look after them.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Does Tower do that? Nope.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ? I&quot;ve never heard of such a thing with cds - unless they're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defective, most stores will not accept returns of opened
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merchandise.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be a great policy for record stores to have, but it
&gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; highly unusual to me..

Yeah, it is punky compared to the album track or even the demo.  Great
snotty vocals from Syd, and they rock hard.  It's from a Granada TV
programme.  Footage is from the UFO Club, 20 Jan 1967.  The audio can be
