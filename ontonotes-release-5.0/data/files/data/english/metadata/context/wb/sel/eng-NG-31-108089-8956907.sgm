Well, in the news there recently,(Reno) there have been a series of

&gt;Here's the interview of the vet who took the action.
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px1PTsEdC1Y&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=
">

A few years ago we (dp, Randy, Chuck, SGBB n' I) were at a NAS motel
in Baker City, OR.  We've stayed there on other occasions since it's
got all th' basics nearby.  An East Indian family owns/runs th' place.

Anyway, after a bit I notice th' American flag onna flag pole was all
fuckin' knotted up in th' pulley cord, barely above half staff.
Pissed me th' fuck off, it did.  I also noticed th' light bulb above
it was busted out and they'd obviously been flyin' it 24/7 sans proper
lighting for th' pm hours.

So I yarded it down, untangled it and raised it back up like it's
s'posed to be.  Then went in th' office and had a little talk with th'
owners about it.  After 'splainin' how it's s'posed to be displayed, I
was convinced they hadn't known and sorta gave 'em th' benefit of th'
doubt.  Except, I told 'em that if I ever saw that flag tangled all
up, at about half staff and/or flown after dark sans proper lighting
that I was gonna have another talk with 'em.

They replaced th' bulb immediately and I've never seen it improperly
displayed since.

That Mexican bar owner in th' story above is an entirely different
sito.  Did m' heart good to see his ass virtually handed to him.

Well isn't that special.

Let me start out here:

The owner of the little Mexican bar said that he didn't know any better.....I
don't believe it for a minute. I think he did it on purpose and was showing a
tremendous amount of disrespect for our country and traditions.

Now let's go here:

After seeing this clip, the original story on CNN, and the follow up.....the
&quot;veteran&quot; heard about the thing on a radio talk show earlier in the day. Callers
were whipping themselves into a frenzy over it.

Sooo..... I had to ask myself.......

How did the news crew just happen to be there when the guy &quot;performed&quot; his act
of bravado......oh yeah, he called them. It was all a setup so he could get his
15 minutes of fame and look like a big tough guy. It was street theater and the
media was sucked right into it.

He claimed that Federal Law was being broken, well...it wasn't. The US Code does
contain flag display guidelines which the government says are there so that
civilians can voluntarily comply with tradition. There are no provisions for
enforcement or penalties if those guidelines are broken.

So....he lied. The Reno Police issued a news release on Wednesday stating that
it was NOT illegal. ( http://tinyurl.com/2mtv3a )

He was flashing around a big K-Bar type knife, where I live brandishing a deadly
weapon in public is against the law and will land ya in the pokey.

He cut the halyard on the flagpole.....let's see......vandalism of private
property.

Then he challenged the owner of the place to a fight if he wanted the flag back
and left with the other guy's flag......that was theft, and after flashing
around the big ass knife, could be considered armed robbery (a stretch I know).

I might have had just a shred of respect for what the loudmouth did if he'd NOT
arranged for a TV news crew to be there to see his act, and if he'd gone down
there and without a word lowered the flags, rearranged them, ran them back up
the pole, and then calmly explained to the bar owner that in reality you
shouldn't display two national flags on the same pole........two poles should be
used.

This thing started wrong, and just went so much more wrong on so many levels.

15 minutes is up.........

And who were the PC punks afraid to confront the guy?????? All the brave men who
whined about it on a radio talk show and Craig's list for three days?????

Maybe nobody did anything because there was nothing to be done. The flag act was
disrespectful, but broke no laws. .......no matter what some misinformed veteran
claims on the evening news. The flag code makes no provision for enforcement or
penalty in case the guidelines aren't followed.

Only result of the guy acting like a horse's ass for the news is that bunches of
rednecks have started jumping up and down with glee, spilling their beer (now
that's a FUCKING crime).........other than that, nothing was accomplished.

Article states they were there to film his &quot;Act of Defiance&quot;, how did they know
what was going to happen???? Although the article quotes him as saying he had no
idea the news people would be there....my money is on him lying about it, he's
already lied about the &quot;federal law&quot;. And the film clip proves he's a vandal and
a thief.

I'm wondering about what PX he bought that commemorative knife at??? It's
commercially available at a variety of places, but sure didn't come from the
Army as he stated on the video.......Ka-Bar's been making them since 1975 in a
variety of versions that anyone can purchase. Sure wasn't military issue.

I don't think so. I read your story about a similar situation you encountered
personally. You fixed the problem with the flag and talked to the owner about it
right? I don't recall that you did any damage to personal property, nor did you
steal anything. I doubt ya flashed a weapon and challenged anyone to fight over
it..........

Although your hat may be off to the guy.....he still came off like a loud mouth

We answered your question about my balls at SNIFF last year when you played the
part of a turd in a punch bowl. You cornered my wife and I, crossed your arms,
and demanded at the top of your voice to know if I had the balls to repeat what
I'd said to you here on RMH, I said yes and said &quot;Fuck You&quot;......even repeated
it. There were witnesses........so don't try calling me a liar. You may not

I am not now, nor have I ever been a greeter at Wal-Mart. My manhood is not for

a living. I don't make disparaging remarks about you being a fireplace
salesman..........and wouldn't, it's honest work.

You seem to have as many problems in your life as anyone, you should probably
concentrate on taking care of those instead of trying to bully and intimidate
people all the time.

I volunteered for and served in combat operations in our military during time of
war, I earned a Combat Action Ribbon and a Vietnam Service Medal with a Campaign
Star in an unpopular war at a time when military service was spat upon.  I spent
the rest of my career as a public servant........

And I had to sit here worrying about my son for 5 1/2 years during his military
service, especially during his time in Iraq and Baghdad.

I have a pretty good understanding of what a patriot is.

FWIW, I listened to him for an hour.  Th' conclusions that I drew are
from that since I haven't seen th' video.  I did read what he said on
TV tho.

It was a talk show and he stuck around to answer listeners calls.  He
fielded every call calmly and with a profound sense of patriotism.  I
tried to find a feed for th' interview here, but couldn't find one:
http://www.kiro710.com/showdj.asp?DJID=31726

Anyway, I'll reserve judgement on th' guy until there's a few less
unanswered questions.  He answered everything you guys are talkin'
about to my satisfaction.

Amen to that, I live in a border state that seems over run with them....it's
been out of hand for a LONG LONG time........current stats published in the
newspaper recently here shows that 1 in 7 adult males in Arizona are illegal
aliens. Which has a tremendous impact on our crime stats, tax base, all sorts of
shit.........

I'd like nothing better than to see all 11 million (or so) illegals rounded up
and shoved back to where they came from. But since it seems we can't even
control Baghdad.........I know something else will end up happening, my crystal
ball's in the shop too.....so I have no idea what the solution looks like.

Starting in January here in Arizona, all businesses are required to verify
citizenship of their employees. Any business found to be knowingly employing
illegals loses it's frikkin business license. Some have already started the
process, better to replace the illegals with legals now than to get caught when
the law kicks in.

Already we've seen lower numbers of illegals crossing the border (lots are still
passing through though)......and we've even seen a flow of them going back home.
Seems lots of them think they may as well go home if they can't work and make
money here.

I hate the BS the supporters of illegals spout......the crap about how illegals
are not all criminals. Well........that ignores the fact that they became
criminals the moment they illegally crossed the border, and every moment they
stay here illegally extends their criminal behavior.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yep, lots of people were unhappy with that as there always seems to be  when
someone else exercises their right of free speech. I didn't think much of it either.

No I didn't and what we hear and see often influences our thoughts about things.

Here's a quote from the discussion board on the Reno TV station's website that I
just love........it pretty well captures most of my feelings on this topic.

&quot;Most of us by now have learned that it is, in fact, not illegal to disgrace our
flag in the manner reported. However well-intentioned Jim Brossard was, it was
an illegal act on his part to remove the flag.

While I salute his patriotism and totally understand his motivation, I cannot
condone his action. I would love to see patriotic Americans show their 1st
Amendment rights by totally boycotting/protesting the involved business.

The owner knew he would be stirring the pot when he did what he did, let this
(blockade) be his reward. ACLU get a life.

I've always thought there are ways of doing things....and there are ways of
doing things. Not always easy to figure out the right way.....or popular.

go to where they are.  It's gonna get interesting, that's for sure.

Funny thing about freedom of speech, there can be consequences

Cops here are busting illegals and the folks who hire them for day jobs on
street corners. Has made it a more pleasant experience to go to Home Depot....&lt;sfsf&gt;

Yep.......sometimes lines get crossed.

Couple years ago there was a BIG protest march down here for the illegals,
Mexican flags were frikkin everywhere. There was a HUGE public outcry......next
time they decided to have a march, American flags were everywhere, nary a
Mexican flag was seen. Public opinion can change inappropriate behavior........

&lt;which is another topic&gt;

Some of the problem with this is that most of the American companies there still
don't pay the workers enough to keep them south of the border.......

Back in the '30's Mexico nationalized the American/European oil companies (among
other things) who were operating there and kicked them to the curb. Would be
interesting to see if that would happen again.....

Would me nice to see some of the jobs coming back.

Our relations with Mexico have never been the very best........might be because
about 150 years ago we took some of their most valuable territory by force of
arms?????? Our military surrounded Mexico City and shelled it until they
surrendered.

Yet we want them to &quot;go back to where they came from&quot;..........&lt;sfsf&gt;

Here's a snapshot of his audience (no poll that I saw):

&quot;News • Talk 710 KIRO's Dori Monson doesn't adhere to a political
stance, such as &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;democrat&quot;. He approaches each story
by judging its issues on merit. As a talk show host, Dori considers
himself a government watchdog, geared toward keeping government's role
in our lives to a reasonable limit.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again, you snipped a point and rephrased what I said, sans a few
important words.  I do think it's an accomplishment pissin' off
*legal* Mexicans.  Just as important as having Muslems pissed off at
th' radical fringe.  Once they start doin' somethin' within, good
stuff happens.  And that fuckin' mexican flag isn't above ours
anymore.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I wish you'd have heard his radio interview.  He stated in no
&gt;&gt; uncertain terms that he's fully prepared to accept th' consequenses of
&gt;&gt; his actions, if any.  Disrespecting th' flag effects some folks that
&gt;&gt; way.

&gt;Probably.....but it reminds me of my younger brother when we were growing up. I
&gt;would make decisions about things based on whether they were right or
&gt;wrong.....he made decisions based on whether he thought enduring the punishment
&gt;was worth it.

&gt;That, in my books, is sociopathic behavior.....

There's no evidence, yet again, to support that contention.  As far as
I know, this is a single event, not some history of similar actions by
this guy.  You can extrapolate this out to whatever conclusion suits
ya, but that doesn't make it true.

So far, according to you, he's a liar, vandal, thief, and a sociopath.
You come to those conclusions with not one single fact to back any of
it.

Liar:  No proof.
Vandal:  No charges filed.
Thief:  No charges filed.
Sociopath:  No proof.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Fuck him, fuck his flag, and fuck his illegal pal's.

&gt;I feel the same way........but did he, as a legal citizen, have the protection
&gt;of the constitution in doing what he did?????? I believe so, in which case no
&gt;matter how offended I was, what occurred was inappropriate and possibly illegal.
">

And I say, so fucking what.  Cite me for whatever, I'm not gonna stand
there and see my flag desecrated.  We all break th' law, I hear yer
bride runs stops signs, I speed, blah, blah, blah.  And like yer
sociopathic brother and th' rest of us, so do you.  Get off yer high

I wouldn't mind listening to shows like that, I like watching Glen Beck on
CNN...he's a conservative.....but doesn't seem to march in lockstep with the
republican party........

Down here talk radio is either slanted one way or the other and usually too far
either way for me. People on the far right think I'm a liberal, I'm much more of
a moderate conservative.........

Dirty Harry thinks I'm a communist cocksucker..........but that's been a joke
that started at Amanda's a couple years ago after drinking a bit too much.

No I didn't..........do you see the words &quot;I don't see&quot;...that would refer to

Based on his own statements about the flag violation, and his &quot;army knife&quot;.

Saw him (on video) cut the halyard on someone else's flagpole. No charges being

Saw him (again on video) walk off with another person's property, once

Sounds fair, so long as those consequences are within the limits of the law.
