&quot;Before Columbia there were two instances where we landed and some of
this coating, visibly little amounts ... was off the vehicle when it
landed,&quot; Hale said. &quot;Nothing bad had happened, the vehicle survived.
There was a theory as to why this happened, we developed a screening
technique that we thought would detect the problem before it became
critical, before it became a safety-of-flight issue.&quot;

After the first post-Columbia mission, however, thermography revealed
an area of concern on an RCC panel from the shuttle's right wing. The
panel - 8R - was removed and returned to the vendor, Lockheed Martin,
for refurbishment. In the course of post-flight inspections, Hale said,
engineers discovered &quot;there was more sub-surface damage than we would
have expected on that panel.&quot;

Now, that sounds like coating degradation is not a visible abrassion effect
on the outer surface. Its rather an effect behind the surface, between the
coating and the RCC carbon layer. With thermography they were able to see
the area where the bonding between the coating and the RCC carbon was lost.
Its visible by its lower thermal intertia now. But I would expect such a
seperated coating dangerously brittle. In the area it is gone the RCC carbon
gets oxydized and burns through.

NASA has now serious unknowns:

- how much of the &quot;thermography revealed&quot; area has already debonded coating
that will not survive re-entry?

- could the unknown process what caused it be active at launch (for example
heating and pressure drop may trigger H2O pockets) or just before peak
heat at re-entry?

From that perspective any good engineer would vote a delay to fix it.

But NASA:

&quot;I would love to be in the position of saying we understand all our
problems completely and we have resolved them all and there is nothing
that's worrying anybody,&quot; Hale said. &quot;The fact of the matter is this is
a very complicated vehicle, it's an old vehicle and there are a lot of
loose ends out there. We fly every time without having solved every one
of our problems, found a root cause of every one of our issues.&quot;

The problem seems less to know the root cause but whether the vehicle
on the pad has a good chance to survive the next flight. Lets hope it has.
There is only hope but no knowledge base. After this flight they will
know more, thats for sure.

So, why not pinch some good ones from another orbiter, and then they would
have time to test the others and maybe fit new ones?

Or is this a case of that tests show no problem so why bother again.

Shuttle management said in Aviation Week NASA doesn't understand the
problem, but it hasn't killed anyone yet, so we think it is OK to fly.

I of course paraphrased management's statement, but not by much.   It was
this type of thinking that caused the loss of Challenger and Columbia.

I'm betting you &quot;paraphrased&quot; their statement and lost the original meaning
in the process.

I have not seen the Aviation Week article, but from what I've read in other
articles, it says NASA doesn't understand what's causing the problem in the
protective layer on the RCC panels.  However, they do have data which
indicates that the problem seen in the three suspect panels was not getting
worse, despite being flown.  In other words, they did have data that
supported flying one more time with the suspect panels.

This is absolutely *not* the same line of thinking that caused Challenger.
In the case of Challenger, the engineers had data that showed there could be
a problem.  Management responded by telling the engineers that they
essentially had to prove it was unsafe to fly.  This is not the same thing
as providing data that shows it should be safe to fly.

With Columbia, the *assumption* was made that RCC was &quot;tougher&quot; than the
tiles, so they *assumed* that even if the foam hit the RCC, it would not
cause any damage.  There was no test data to support this failed assumption.
Again, in this case, management was making the engineers prove there was a
problem before they'd change the mission plan (since Columbia was already in
orbit).  Without proof of impending doom, there would be no thoughts of
heroic attempts to save the crew.

Again, in the case of today's three suspect RCC panels, there is actual
flight data that indicates that it's safe to fly.

And what is this flight data?  The problem hasn't killed anyone yet :-)

By this logic Challanger had flight data it is OK to fly with the primary
o-ring leaking because the secondary ring prevents a catastrophic failure.
Or you can say Colombia had flight data that foam strikes will not cause
catastrophic failure of the TPS.

I will have say NASA is much better at not quashing the dissenting opinion.
This is a big step forward for them.

Uh, I read it not like that. They had thermography data that showed no
worsening in last flight. But thermography only shows debonded area. Where
the RCC coating is no longer in contact with the RCC carbon base. But
around this is probably an area with weak bonding. Still contact but too
weak to transfer usefule forces. That area is crucial to keep the coating
in place and prevent its collapse. Thermography cant see this area.

Now they have sliced on panel and have one data point. They only can hope
the other panels with &quot;thermography suspicious area&quot; have the same or less
weak bonding area. And they have to hope the area grows linear each
mission. But what if it is related to chemical attacks by some exhaust?
What if all the damage we see is caused by one thruster fire at a special
time during early re-entry? Because they dont know the cause there are
some awefule possibilities. And I still saw no good reason not to delay
the mission a few weeks to fix this.

Sorry.  Apples and oranges.  In the case of the o-rings, engineers had a
decent understanding of the correlation between the cold and the amount of
o-ring erosion.  This was data gathered from previous flights.  In other
words, the engineering data supported their push to at least delay the
launch until the weather warmed.  They were overruled by low level managers
who were more worried about schedule than safety.  This discussion didn't
make it &quot;to the top&quot; like it clearly did with the current flight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The opinion to delay the launch of Challenger (wait for warmer weather) was
backed by engineering data.  The opinion to roll back and replace RCC in the
case of the current flight was backed by safety people who are worried that
NASA does not understand the root cause of the defects in the protective
layer on the RCC.  In this launch, the supporters of the launch had
engineering data which shows that the defects have not gotten worse over
several flights, so there is little reason to believe that it will get worse
on this flight.  Furthermore, these discussions happened at the very highest
levels in NASA and everyone got a chance to voice their opinion and show
their data.  This clearly didn't happen with Challenger.

They should point the finger at themselves.  They need more equipment to
fight these fires, but they have not funded the purchase of that equipment
(or funded the positions needed to operate that equipment).

But all in all, they seem to be responding well with the equipment they
have.  That and the governor didn't wait to ask for aid (like New Orleans
and Louisiana did with Katrina).

See, I'm not sure that's really valid thinking.  We don't know what causes
this, so we don't now if the conditions in the last 3 flights were relevant

This is a good change.  And ultimately other than the soundbites we're
seeing here, I'm sure there's a lot more detailed technical discussion that
went into this.

In any case, the risk will never be zero.  If folks involved have suffecient
information at hand and all parties have been heard, then I think all that

Can't be.  We don't let Shuttle fly through any rain, acid or alkali
