Here it goes.  I have been studying what a compressor is &amp; does.  I
have read my Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook on this subject as
well as other sources and I have identified a possible application;
and I submit it here as a reality check.  Keep in mind I am a Worship
Leader of a small (but growing) Church.  We meet in a converted Parish
Hall which used to be used for wedding receptions because it was so
big.  We have a contemporary band - a keyboardist, a bass guitarist, a
drummer, and an electric guitarist.

We also have 2 female singers (I sing as well).  A very common problem
is that people say they don't hear the female singers.  I have been
working with them and telling them they must keep their lips
practically on the mic (Shure SM58s).  I still have difficulty.

What if I were to send their 2 voices to an AUX output, set the
threshold to say +4 dBu, set the ratio to 6:1, click on the OverEasy
switch (I have a dbx 266XL), and then raise the output.  The intended
outcome of course would be that they would be heard more; especially
in the quiet sections.  A additional thought... I could also just put
one of their voices on channel 1 and the other on channel 2.

What do you all think?  Have I learned?

** Nothing.

If the girl singers cannot be heard  - turn up their mics.

If you cannot do that due to feedback squeals,  then you are outta luck.

Compressors are used on PA vocal mics to limit the level for singers that
are inclined to sing  TOO  LOUD.

What would you do with the signal then? If you ran it back in to the desk
then you would have 4 channels of their voices instead of two. It can work
that way and I use it a lot for drums and distorted guitars but it doesn't
work so well on vocals.

That would be a better solution

Of course you could just turn them up in the mix.

Here is the problem Timothy: Unless your AUX send is pre fader and the fader
is down any effect will be a blend of clean plus processed sound. It will
work &quot;a little bit&quot; but not nearly as well as and putting the comp on a
channel insert. In addition when feeding multiple mics through one comp
channel , once one voice/signal trips the compressor all are reduced
equally. I suspect you will find it's an exercise in frustration.

Here's a suggestion: for very little $ you can get a Behringer V-verb that
has a pretty wonderful reverb/delay preset. use the aux send to feed the
verb and mix to taste. The delay will probably end up being about 50% (or
less) in amplitude of the clean signal. The net effect is a &quot;thicker&quot; sound.
Adding reverb may not be &quot;natural&quot; sounding but it is often pleasant.

In your situation does someone operate the mixer or is it a set and forget?
Is the mixer located in the rear of the audience or somewhere that the main
speakers can be herd?

I have a t.c. electronic M350 Effects Processor.  Will that work as
well?  Right now I have an AUX send going to the t.c. electronic M350
and then I have left and right going back to the soundboard into 2
different channels.  A friend suggested that.  Does that sound right?

What sort of settings should I use?  Can you give me an idea as to
what I should do with the knobs to make it sound nice?

Yes, pan the channels hard left and hard right

Normally when using an EFX unit live you set it for 'wet' or 100% of the
effect and use the return to balance the effect with the clean sound.

I would pick studio delay and live reverb to start with. You can also try
the chorus settings.
Then it's a matter of tweaking the knobs until you get the most plesent
sound.
If you cant locate the manual its here:

The trick is to not use too much. Then the sound goes from being enhanced to
just sounding weird.

Thanks, I'll try those settings and play with it.  Thanks for
verifying my reverb setup.  Those channels are panned hard left and
hard right; just like you suggested.

I only asked because from what I am learning, you can't treat a
compressor the same way.  I now understand that it would be better to
use a channel insert for that.  On that, what does a channel insert
cable look like?  How does that work?

Thanks, Tim.  I printed it out and will read it tonight.  I scanned it
real quick and it looks as if this will be very helpful.  I also
looked at my Mixer's manual (a Mackie 1604VLZ pro) and it has actually
been helpful as well.  I appreciate your helping me thru it.  I look
forward to learning more &quot;on the job&quot;.  I really love this stuff and
appreciate your patience.

You need to play with a compressor and check what it does when and how it
sounds when it does what it does, reading alone doesn't do it.

In reply to both Peter and Tim, I am a reader and a learner, but at
some point I have to close the book and start turning the knobs.
That's what I plan on doing this weekend.  Thanks again for taking the
