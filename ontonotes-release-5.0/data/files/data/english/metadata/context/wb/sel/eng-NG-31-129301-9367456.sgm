In an era when weekend business spells ‘do or die’ for a film and
deadly SMS’s (starting soon after the film's premier commences)
contribute to making or breaking a movie, it is rare to see a majority
of film personalities standing up and acknowledging an effort from a
film coming from a second time director.

Yes, I am talking about Sriram Raghavan and his ‘wow-watt a-film’ Johnny Gaddaar!

Once the film released on the Friday is gone by, audience was unanimous
in concluding that this was the under hyped though deserving film of
the year. Reason? Johhny Gaddaar had all what a lover of quality, intelligence, entertainment would ever look for!

A thriller that alternates between the style of Alfred Hitchcock,
Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie amongst many other Hollywood greats
while still being core 'desi' at heart (Vijay Anand would definitely
nod in the affirmative), Johhny Gaddaar came with decent publicity sans any

'look-at-me-I-am-the-best' approach. Adlabs and Sriram preferred to let the film do the talking.

So much so, that they chose to publicize Neil Nitin Mukesh as much as
probably Dharmendra, Zakir Hussain (wow, what an actor!) or
Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy-Hardkaur's sassy music video 'Doob Jaa Mere Pyaar
Mein'!

What they did was right. The film actually did all the talking and the first caller was an unsuspecting Madhur Bhandarkar.

When my cell phone rung at 1 AM on Sunday morning with the name Madhur
Bhandarkar being flashed, I thought that he was finally ready with his
announcement for his much-in-demand 'Fashion'. Well, he did disappoint
me by answering my obvious question in the negative but had me all
open-eyed as he started talking about how he was literally bowled over
by Johnny Gaddaar.

&quot;Mind-blowing,” he said, and continued to rattle the same word
repeatedly for at least half a dozen times more. After constantly
insisting to say something else about the film
he caught his breath and got started.

&quot;This is a film which I would recommend every aspiring film maker to be
watching. What a film? You just do not know what is going to hit you
next. Sriram has impressed me in all ways and I am going to make sure
that the world is aware about the kind of storyteller this filmmaker
is. Also, look at Neil. I am sure I am not the first or the last person
to be saying that this boy would do wonders in years to come,” he
started his commentary..

He was not going to stop now. &quot;I consider myself to be such a big
critic of cinema. Whenever a movie releases, I make sure to find out
the best and the worst part about it. But Johnny Gaddaar? I am still
trying to find loopholes in the script and cannot find any! ‘Kya
zabardast screenplay hai’! My heart goes out to Sriram’s fantastic
effort. Did you notice the camerawork? Mind-blowing (there he goes
again...)! I could hardly see the suspense coming. The film now sits at
the top of some of the best thrillers I have watched,&quot; concluded Madhur
while finally managing to catch a breath.

Honest comments like these coming from a director, who have seldom seen
such great things about a film, made me turn myself to composer Vishal
Dadlani. It was around a month back when he had first led me to believe
that Johnny Gaddaar
was a film to watch out for. He had watched it a number of months back
when it was yet to be stuffed with background score and SFX and
apparently was bowled over by the entire execution. What did he have to
say now after the release of the film?

&quot;Sriram is a truly genius director. Doesn't that just sum it up,” he
asks, &quot;He is one film maker who has the courage to make truly great
films. Look at the way he has pushed the envelope here again after Ek Haseena Thi. Could you really see the suspense coming and that too in

a film where the suspense was actually supposed to have been revealed in the first 15 minutes itself?&quot;

Talking about the 'surprise discovery' of the year when all eyes are
set on Ranbir Kapoor, Harman Baweja and Sikandar Kher, Vishal says,
&quot;It's great to see a boy like Neil entering the arena. In an industry
where we are eyeing for new talent to be making a mark, a boy like Neil
deserves to be acknowledged and accepted. A few more good moves and the
game is on for him!&quot;

With all around positive vibes coming from industry folks and friends
in general, I started keeping a close eye on what others had to say
about the film. A little birdie informed that ‘Bluffmaster’ Rohan
Sippy, was not quite bluffing while singing praises for Johnny Gaddaar
I expected my quick SMS to Rohan being answered in a few hours time
once he got some time off from pre-production of his next film. To my
pleasant surprise it was barely 10 minutes, when the reply came, &quot;It is
about Johnny Gaddaar, so let's talk now!&quot;

Moreover, when Rohan started, there was no end. &quot;We need film makers
like Sriram Raghavan. There are few as talented, innovative and out of
the box thinkers like him. Are you aware that he was carrying this idea
with him for last 3-4 years? It is so heartening to see someone's
strong conviction and belief in a plot finally resulting in a path
breaking film like this. It was his relentless drive to get the project
going in spite of all the hardships in his way which has made Johnny Gaddaar the movie it is today&quot;, informed Rohan.

&quot;The film makes for a case study of how style meets substance! In
addition, if you notice carefully, Sriram has such an economical style
of shot taking. In most of the shots, you would see so much happening
in a single frame, consciously or subconsciously,” stated Rohan about
the finer art of filmmaking.

Well, I had to agree here as well, especially after watching the film
second time on 4 days. Truly, there are many layers and sub layers to
the frames, which deserve a closer view of the film. By the way, did
you notice that how in a remote corner of one of the frames; a club
employee opens and silently closes the door when realizing that the
scuffle happening behind in the confines of the office was only between
partners, Zakir Hussain and Vinay Pathak with Neil Mukesh busy
attempting a truce?

Rohan continued to talk passionately about the film, &quot;It is good to see
audience unanimous about the film and especially Neil. He has done
quite well for himself in his first film and there are two things,
which have worked positively for him. a) He didn't have to shoulder
responsibility since there were so many other important characters in
the film. b) This very factor made him work doubly hard since he had to
give his best shot with so many fantastic actors around!&quot;

Next stopover was filmmaker Onir who is always a pleasure to talk to
when it comes to discussing a point or two about any and every film.
What did he think about Johnny Gaddaar? &quot;I am sad,” he commented. Shocked with the response, I asked him why? &quot;So many appalling

films get a 100% opening these days and when a genuinely terrific film like Johnny Gaddaar comes, all its hopes of survival depend upon

word of mouth,” he explained his point of view.

&quot;Thank goodness that no one has anything bad to say about the film.
Moreover, no one actually cares for a review or two gone being not too
positive. I am happy to see word of mouth being so positive for the
film that it gives a good breather for Johhny Gaddaar to aim for a

healthy innings ahead&quot;, said Onir about the film's box office prospects. How about the film, in general?

&quot;Oh, I have been a fan of Sriram's work ever since I know him before he made his debut with Ek Haseena Thi,”
he commented.. &quot;The guy understands cinema so well and is a true student
of whatever good is made, whether 'desi' or 'videsi'. All this while we
have been craving to see something different and genuinely 'hatke', now
Johnny Gaddaar is what I call truly 'hatke'. The film would certainly be talked about

years down the line.&quot;

When Onir gets sentimental, he 'does' get sentimental. He was particularly offended by some stray reviews calling Johnny Gaddaar
a little slow in portions. &quot;Sorry, I do not agree,” he revolted, &quot;You
don't expect a zing-bang-bring-on-the-cameraman kind of cinema in every
frame being shot in a thriller. There needs to be just the right pacing
for a plot to take shape and that could happen at any point in the
film, whether in the beginning, middle or the end. I see Johnny Gaddaaras a flawless piece of work with just the right pace and duration.&quot;

Yes, I do agree. Moreover, I am sure most of the viewers and readers too!
