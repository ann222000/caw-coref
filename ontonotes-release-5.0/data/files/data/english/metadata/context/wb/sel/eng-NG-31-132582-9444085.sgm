THE MESSAGE FOR THE DAY

It Takes a Lifetime
But solid food belongs to those
who are of full age . . .
those who by reason of use
have their senses exercised
to discern both good and evil.
Hebrews 5:14

It has been said that the new birth takes but a moment;
spiritual maturity takes a lifetime.
Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in the Parable of the Sower
where Jesus warns His disciples about the many different ways in which God's
Word would be received.
He said some would fall by the wayside,
being snatched up by the devil
as soon as the Word entered their heart.
Others would receive the Word with joy,
but fall away during a time of temptation.
Still others would hear the Word,
yet remain entangled in the cares
of the world,
making it impossible for them to bring
any spiritual fruit to maturity.
Finally,
Jesus told of the ones who,
&quot;having heard the Word with a noble
and good heart,
keep it and bear fruit with patience&quot;
(Luke 8:11-15).
Spiritual maturity is a continual process
of growth that takes time and patience.
If we remain rooted in the Word
and nourished through prayer
and fellowship with the Lord,
we will surely see our faith grow
as never before.

Christians should move on
to spiritual maturity.
We must feast on the meat
of God's Word and put into practice
the lessons we have learned.
It's the only way to grow up.
