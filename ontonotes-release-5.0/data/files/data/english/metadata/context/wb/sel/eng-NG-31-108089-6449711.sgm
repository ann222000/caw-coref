I recently purchased a '98 FLHTC (carburated).  What type, brand, etc. is a
good unit to purchase that does the job?  I have only been riding for two
years and this is my first Harley.  Thanks in advance

Read the rules, and I'll have a scotch and water, pick your poison. Shirley,
set em up for the house.
I managed to find a Harley-Davidson unit on eBay after I bought my '95 FXD.
It has a thermostat and has worked great for over 2 years.
No experience with any other brand, there are probably some good ones other

Have you noticed that Harley doesn't come with an oil cooler?  The
primary reason for that is that THEY DON'T NEED ONE!  They're a lot like oil
pressure gauges..........they'll cause more problems than they'll fix.
If you insist on adding an oil cooler remember that you also need a
thermostat, an oil cooler cover (for when the thermostat fails), &amp; an oil
temperature gauge.  Without those extras your oil cooler may trash your motor
some cool night while your non-oil coolered friends putt on home.
'Course that's just me &amp; my 21yr old (non coolered) Harley talkin'.
YMMV....................

Switch to synthetic oil and you won't need one.  Seriously.

I put a Jagg Cooler on my 02 Fatboy last year. It was nicely made and the
design was straightforward.
A few words of caution however.
Installing an oil cooler obviously requires that all the oil be drained from
the system. Make Sure that when you reassemble everything, you partially
fill new oil filter with fresh oil before mounting.
When I installed mine, I bought an extra quart thinking that I would need
extra to fill the lines, cooler unit, etc. After I buttoned everything up
and filled the oil tank, the bike had taken less oil than it had on the
previous oil changes. The oil tank was full to the top. I started it hoping
that the level would drop as oil ran into the filter and
cooler.......nothing. Then I got the bright idea to ride around the block.
Half way into that jaunt, I smelled the awful smell of cooking motor.
topping at the stop sign, I noticed that the motor was WAY too hot and
making those ticking sounds that mean..."new motor....S&amp;S or revtech"?
I parked the bike, opened the oil tank cap and saw that the oil level hadn't
moved.
It appeared that the big air bubble in the filter and cooler assembly
wouldn't allow any oil to circulate.
I left the bike there for the day. When I next checked on it the oil level
had dropped way down in the oil tank. I added an additional quart and rode
it home. Next day it was normal, no damage. I got lucky, if I had blasted
right out of my driveway onto a highway, I'd still be making payments for my
new 124" crate motor.

First, thanks for all the responses.  I am a "new" (63 years young) Harley
owner and trying not to ask or sound stupid.  That may elude me from time to
time so I apologize up front.

I took the bike in to the local dealer for the 20k mile checkup Sunday
afternoon.  The service manager told me that he would not change to
synthetic but continue to use 20W-50 regular oil.  I asked why and he stated
that it was an old bike.  Needless to say, I was dumbfounded.  Yes, it is a
'98 but only had 20k miles.  Plus, I had the maintenance records.  He did
say if I "insisted" on using synthetic, I should use Amsoil.

I view of the foregoing, why Amsoil?  I am not trying to belabor the point
only pick up "experienced" answers that connot be found in books.

Thanks again for all the responses.

I live on the Atlantic seaboard, Eastern Virginia.  Most of my riding will
probably be done from Pennsylvania to Florida and maybe as far west as
Kentucky or Mississippi but primarily in Virginia and North Carolina.  Based
on that, I assume it would be a waste of time and money to add a cooler.

let me buy a round and for those of you that think oil is an over discussed
issue here, ya'll mosy on over to the pool table or the pinball machine and
i'll buy the next game to distract you from the conversation.

our new bike gets the h-d brand synthetic oil for warranty issues.  while
using a different oil is not supposed to void the warranty according to the
magnusson act our local dealer insists that using a non h-d branded oil
*will* void the warranty.  no sense in having to argue with them if we have
an issue.  (they seem like the kind you would have to drag through the court
system) but paying over ten bucks a quart really jerks my chain...

for all of the other bikes i use castrol 20-50 full synthetic.  i can buy it
off the shelf at any auto parts store or even wall mart.  at half the price
of h-d branded synthetic and being readily available on the road it is just
plain convienent.  amsoil, royal purple and the like are fine if you don't
think you will ever be changing your oil in podunk tennesse or nowhere north
carolina.  if i was running a racing machine i would go with an "exotic".
for your run of the mill cruiser just pick a full synthetic that you can
find easily and at a fair price and stick with it.  15-50 or 20-50 IMHO.

There is a chance that the slippery nature of synthetic might get past
some of the seals etc.  Personally, I wouldn't worry about it.  I run
Royal Purple in my 93, similar to Amsoil I suppose, which are even
slippier than regular synthetic.  I started out with Mobile 1 however,
and it took care of my pinging problems.  I run 10:1 pistons and a
bolt in cam, along with intake and exhaust mods that tend to make my
engine run hot.

I didn't mean to turn this into an oil conversation, but my original
statement still stands.  If your stock engine is running a little hot,
as would be evidenced by pinging, running synth will probably take
care of the situation.  If it is not pinging, they you don't have a
problem to start with.

I had no problem running the Mobile 1, but did develop a leak in the
camshaft oil seal when I started with the Royal Purple.  It could have
very well been just a worn seal though, and not the fault of the oil.

He's an idiot. Age has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not a
bike can use and benefit from synthetic oil.  The biggest advantages of
synthetic oil is their extended thermal resistance and their resistance
to breaking up their molecular chains under pressure.

Which is to say they don't break down under heat and pressure as easily
as nonsynthetics do.  I've never seen any objective studies (as in
'Studies Not Funded by Amsoil') that showed it to be in any significant
way superior to other synthetics.  Unless emptying your wallet is a
measure of superiority, of course.

Any synthetic oil of proper viscosity has advantages over nonsynthetics.
The question really is whether or not you really need those
advantages.  I always run synthetics in everything I own, but I live in
Florida.  Virginia can get pretty warm in it's own right and I used to
run synthetics when I lived in Richmond a millenium or so ago.

If you change your oil every 3,000 miles, IMO, you can run whatever top
line oil you want.  Synthetic, dino oil, whatever.  Just DO NOT run
cheap-ass non-detergent oil.  That stuff is utter crap, but you'll still
find some toothless hillcrawlers who swear that detergent oil will ruin
your engine.  They're wrong, and you'd be well advised not to take

I live in the Hampton, Newport News, Youktown area.  You are correct, the
winters get cold for this region (nothing compared to further north and
west), too cold for this old body.  I am planning to retire next year and
maybe spend some time in Florida with family.  I like shorts and jeans,
short sleeve shirts and deck shoes.

Thanks again for the responses and info.  As previously stated, I just got
started in biking two years ago at the ripe age of 61.  I bought the Harley
March 16 and I am trying to learn the "do's &amp; don'ts".  Kinda think the real
life experiences are better than the books I have been reading.

Amen to that.  As somebody famously said, r.m.h is IRL.

You'll find a lot of us are Decrepit Old Farts and as proud of that as
if we could take credit for it.

Mebbe we'll have to try to hook up with him before MAMMARY,
make sure he's not an axe murder, and see if could survive the
weekend.

BTW, Squire, MAMMARY is in Prince Frederick. But it's invite
only unless we know you. It's fairly tame, with a bunch of old
farts like yerself.

IMO, I'd skip the cooler for sure.  As for Amsoil, that's a religious
argument I've no interest in getting into.  I would, however, recommend
finding a different place to get your bike serviced if the idiot you talked
to is any indication of quality of the dealership.

Personally I run Mobil 1 and\or Castrol Syntec in my bikes.  They are
available just about everywhere and they are half the price of the bike
specific synthetics.  After 10+ years of running these oils in multiple
bikes, both air and water cooled, I'm convinced they are more than adequate
for the job.

IMO, if you change your oil regularly (3000ish) and use a good quality 15-50
or 20-50 weight oil, dino or synthetic, there's about zero chance you'll
ever have any oil related issues with your bike.  IMHO, YMMV, yada, yada,
yada...

i have a 3 phase 30 hp air compressor that provides my entire shop with air.
it runs most of the day 3 to 6 days a week.  it is now 20 years old with
less than a day of down time.  over the years we have had two pop off valves
go bad and it took a couple of hours for my compressor guy to get here with
the part and install it.

my compressor service uses me as a benchmark and testimony for proper
servicing of units as related to longevity.  ever since the unit was
installed they come twice a year and service it.  new filters, any
adjustments and change the oil.  since we use it to supply our air helmet in
the sandblast booth it gets nothing but breathable air rated synthetic oil.
this stuff is expensive and so is having someone else do the job.  but it
gets seen twice a year by a professional so if any issue happened to crop up
it will hopefully get caught before it becomes catastophic.

the reliability of this compressor is one of the main reasons i switched all
of my vehicles to synthetic oil.  i have seen what it has saved me over the
years in down time and reliability.  my dealer said if everyone was willing
to pay for the biannual service and high dollar oil he would go broke.  he
makes his living replacing systems that were not serviced properly.  use the
synthetic in your compressor if your living depends on needing air every
day.

Heh,heh! Those (and a couple of others) are just a little out of my

Well, we don't have the air helmet, and there are two compressors(1
per building).  The older building has a compressor that's bigger than
my FLT, and twice as old.  We've replaced a couple of motors, but
never had a problem with the compressor part.
The new building has the biggest compressor you can get from Harbour
Freight, and we *do* run synthetic oil in it(found this out
yesterday).  That's the one we use to run the sandblaster.
Ours are serviced twice a year by a professional also.  Me.  I also
discovered this just yesterday&lt;g&gt;.

if ya'll are doing as much sandblasing as we do then you need this helmet.
http://www.clemcoindustries.com/clemcoindustries.com_non_ssl/products...

with this climate control tube
http://www.clemcoindustries.com/clemcoindustries.com_non_ssl/products...

during the summer when the compressed air is hot or in the winter when it is
cold you can adjust the air temp to suit the operator.  it is the best
investment i have made for the sandblasting department.  you must use a
breathable air rated filter on the infeed line and a breathable air rated
oil in the compressor but when you spend a full day sanblasting in 95
degree, 90% humidity of north georgia it is worth every dime.

do you run an aftercooler on your compressor?

No, no aftercooler, but a big separator between the compressor and the
shop, and then little separators at each air hose.  The comps get
drained every night and the little separators are the automatic ones
that drain when the pressure drops at night.
In this situation, however, I don't use the air tools as often as I
used to when I worked at the dealerships.  Too easy to scratch a high
dollar  paint job with a hose or a carelessly used air ratchet.
Besides, I'm on an hourly wage now instead of flat rate and speed
doesn't matter.
