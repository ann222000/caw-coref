The Holy Land Map is a revolutionary description of the Land of Israel
as a human figure shape.

The correlation is clear. The landscape can almost serve for anatomy
lessons.

This shape includes: The land between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea as face, the Negev Plateau as neck, Sinai Peninsula
as the torso.

It is a commentary of the Bible, Judaism and the borders of Israel.

The map is a message of social Humanism, global progress and
personal freedom.

It is a physical reality, with a particular relief
which engrave and raise the spirit.
