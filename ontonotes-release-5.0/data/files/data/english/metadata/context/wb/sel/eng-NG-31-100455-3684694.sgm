WHAT IS RABIES?

Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous,system
of mammals. In the last stages of the disease, the virus
moves from the brain into the salivary glands and saliva.
From there the virus can be transmitted through a bite or
by contact with mucous membranes (nose, mouth, and eyes).
It is fatal once symptoms occur. Dogs can be infectious
to others for as long as 2 weeks before the symptoms of
the disease appear, hence the need to confine and observe
suspect animals.

WHAT SPECIES ARE THE MAJOR CARRIERS OF RABIES?

Rabies is predominantly a disease of wild carnivores but
it can affect all mammals. including humans. Different
species have become the main carriers (vectors) in
different areas of the world: dogs in Asia, Africa, the
Middle East, and Latin America; foxes in western Europe
and parts of the United States and Canada; raccoons in
the eastern United States and Ontario, Canada; bats in
North and South America and southeast Asia; mongooses in
South Africa.

Marsupials are much less susceptible to rabies than
placental mammals. In the U.S., for example, opossums
commonly share habitat and food sources with raccoons,
but are virtually never infected. Rodents are relatively
easily infected with rabies, but typically die so quickly
that they are rarely involved in spreading outbreaks.

HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED?

Rabies is caused by rhabdovirus -- a large enveloped
bullet-shaped DNA virus. It is very sensitive to heat,
light detergents (including ordinary soaps) and
disinfectants and cannot survive for long outside the
body of an infected animal.

The virus is carried in the saliva of an infected animal.
It cannot penetrate intact skin. It can be transmitted by
licking when animals groom each other in a manner which
allows the saliva of an infected animal to come in
contact with an open wound. This is believed to be a
common method of transmission among raccoons, among whom
mutual grooming by family members is routine, but is not
considered common among other vector species.

The virus multiplies at the site of the bite, invades
nerve fibres, and travels to the brain. The incubation
period (the time between the bite and the onset of
symptoms) is related to the distance of the wound from
the head and neck: the nearer the head, the shorter the
incubation. Bites to the head and neck carry the highest
risk. This has relevance to the efficacy of post exposure
therapy. Growth of the virus in the brain causes severe
nervous degeneration and eventually death. The virus also
spreads from the brain along other nerves to organs
including the salivary glands, where the virus is
excreted in the saliva. Bites in general are high-risk
exposures. Animal contact by itself -- such as being in
the vicinity of a rabid animal, petting or handling a
rabid animal, or coming into contact with the blood,
urine or feces of a rabid animal -- does not usually
constitute exposure and, therefore, does not usually
require post-exposure rabies treatment. The exception is
if fresh, warm saliva may have been transmitted into an
open wound.

Exposure of a human to a rabid animal does not always
result in rabies. If prevention treatment is obtained
promptly following a rabies exposure, most cases of
rabies will be prevented. All animal bites should be
evaluated by a health professional to determine if
treatment is necessary.

WHO CAN SPREAD RABIES?

The rabies virus can infect any mammal, but infection is
most common among dogs, cats, cows, horses, bats, skunks,
foxes, and raccoons, who have in common a relatively long
latency interval between exposure and the time symptoms
appear. Transmission usually occurs while the vector
animal (the animal carrying the disease) is in the latent
phase (before symptoms appear).

Though it is thought to happen rarely, rabies can also be
spread by animals eating the freshly killed carcasses of
infected animals.

HOW CAN PEOPLE BE PROTECTED AGAINST RABIES?

The best protection against rabies is for people to
vaccinate their pets and any street dogs or cats living
near their homes, and for city authorities to conduct
mass vaccination campaigns for street dogs and cats,
ideally humanely sterilizing (spaying or castrating) the
animals at the same time. Killing animals has never been
effective in preventing the spread of rabies.

In regions where bat rabies occurs, one should avoid
allowing bats to roost in human sleeping areas. Bat
transmissions of rabies typically occur through
accidental nocturnal contact, and as bat fangs typically
leave marks no larger and no more uncomfortable than
mosquito bites, the victims are frequently unaware that
they have been bitten.

IS RABIES CURABLE?

There is no cure once the signs of rabies appear. It is
then inevitably fatal. However, the relatively long
incubation period allows post-exposure therapy to be
effective if done correctly.

WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF RABIES IN ANIMALS?

Symptoms of rabies in animals may include any one or more
of the following signs: excitability; vicious behavior or
attacks; biting; agitation; restlessness;
uncharacteristic aggression; fearlessness; excessive
salivation (so-called frothing at the mouth); aversion to
water (where the name "hydrophobia" comes from);
inability to swallow or drink; dilated pupils; muscular
dysfunction; coordination or gait irregularities;
paralysis; convulsions; and eventually death, almost
always within 10 days. These symptoms are referred to as
furious rabies.

Some rabid animals do not exhibit typical rabid symptoms.
This are generally referred to as dumb rabies. These
animals may display other symptoms of general illness
which may include an avoidance of contact with humans or
other animals, lethargy, loss of appetite, and eventually
death. Some dogs just howl for days and retreat into dark
corners. Their hind legs may give way. A dog may show
very mild symptoms of anorexia (not eating) and
listlessness only, and is found dead in three or four
days. Sometimes the dog shows no signs at all, yet is
suddenly found dead, and a post-mortem examination
reveals rabies.

ARE THESE SYMPTOMS CHARACTERISTIC OF RABIES ONLY?

Unfortunately not. Extreme pain, fear or confusion can
make an animal aggressive. Profuse salivation and the
inability to swallow may result from obstruction in the
throat, foreign bodies in the teeth, or the ingestion of
irritating or toxic substances. Howling could be due to
hunger, fear, or pain. Tetanus infections may sometimes
be misdiagnosed as rabies. But, in any case, such animals
should also be approached with caution as in their pain
they may attack.

At present, rabies can only be positively diagnosed by
testing the brain of an infected animal, and this must be
done at an appropriate laboratory. There are no tests
currently available to definitively diagnose rabies in a
live animal.

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF RABIES IN HUMANS?

Early symptoms in humans include irritability,
inexplicable depression, headache, fever, and sometimes
itching or pain at the site of exposure. The disease
eventually progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat
muscles, convulsions, delirium, and death. It is
important to note that once symptoms appear, rabies
cannot be successfully treated.

HOW SOON AFTER INFECTION DO SYMPTOMS APPEAR?

The incubation period (the time between exposure and the
onset of symptoms) is variable but is normally 3 to 8
weeks in humans. In dogs, the incubation period is
normally between 21 to 80 days, but it may be shorter or
longer.

WHEN AND FOR HOW LONG IS A PERSON ABLE TO SPREAD RABIES?

Person to person transmission is extremely rare, but
precautions should be taken to prevent exposure to the
saliva of the diseased person, including saliva in
aerosol form from coughing, sneezing, or spitting.

WHAT TREATMENT IS NEEDED AFTER EXPOSURE TO RABIES?

Exposure to a rabid animal does not always result in
rabies. If treatment is obtained promptly following a
rabies exposure, most cases of rabies will be prevented.
All animal bites should be evaluated by a health
professional to determine if treatment is necessary.

The most effective rabies prevention is immediate and
thorough cleansing of the site of the animal bite or
scratch wounds with liberal amounts of soap and water, or
flushing mucous membranes with warm water. If the wound
is bleeding profusely, apply pressure with fingers or
hands, or apply a pressure bandage. The wound should not
be sutured, as this is thought to increase the risk of
the virus entering nerves.

This is followed by the administration of an injection of
HRIG (human anti-rabies immune globulin) and five doses
of human diploid cell rabies vaccine administered in the
arm on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after exposure. In some
places, multiple site intradermal (within the skin)
injection protocols are being used successfully and are
cheaper than the standard intramuscular (within the
muscle) post-exposure vaccination program, as they
require less antigen. The old fashioned and inhumane
vaccines of animal brain origin that were injected into
the stomach have now been replaced in most parts of the
world by more effective and safer tissue culture
vaccines. The first injection is an antibody to fight the
virus, and the rest of the injections are a vaccine to
ensure long lasting protection. Post-exposure therapy is
required even by those people who have received
prophylactic vaccination (pre-exposure vaccination);
however,

HISTORY

Animal Rights Fund (ARF) was started on April 5, 1999
after Poornima Harish, Founder and Managing Trustee of
ARF saw the most gory and brutal manner in which the
stray dogs were electrocuted at Bangalore Mahanagara
Palike (BMP) dog pound at Koramangala managed by CUPA.
With co-operation from CUPA and others she videographed
the electrocutions and sent the same to Ms. Maneka
Gandhi, Honorable Minister of Social Justice and
Empowerment, who came to Bangalore and met with the
Corporation officials to put an end this killing.

In May 1999 a few enterprising BMP officials, then
Commissioner Mr. Jairaj and Mr. Ashok Dalwai, who are
passionately committed to the well-being of public, woke
up to the reality and saw the logical new dimension
solution to the problem which was all along known to the
BMP. With their dynamism and vision, they worked on the
WHO/WSPA recommendations and Animal Birth Control (ABC)
/Anti Rabies Vaccination (ARV) started in full steam.

RECENT PAST

ARF has done more than 35000 ABC/ARVs
(sterilizations/vaccinations) till date.

Presently we are doing 1200 ABC/ARVs per month for
Bangalore Mahanagara Palike and the City Municipal
Councils.

OUR WORK

ARF is pure private initiative in action. We did not wait
for government land or money to start work. We took a
farmhouse on rent, with private funding. We also started
the ABC/ARV programme on private donations without any
Government funding. It was much later that the
BMP/Government came forward to meet a part of the
programme expenses in tackling this  public issue.

OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK

We have worked under severe constraints regarding
infrastructure. In the new abandoned farmhouse which we
took on lease cum rent:

There was no flooring in many places so we got the
flooring done there.

There was no water and power (we got the power and
purchased water by tankers).

Earlier we used to tie the dogs to the floor, but now we
have got kennels fabricated.

There were many cracks in the building, which we
repaired.

There was no toilet. We got one constructed.

We have got the entire place renovated and hospitable for
Animals purely on private funding.

Earlier, we have had to rely on expensive mobile phone as
means of contact since we did not have a land line at our
center.

OUR RESOLVE

Even though we have had very little support from the BMP
in the past, we have managed to keep our commitment to
BMP on doing ABC/ARVs and thereby help the public by
bringing about scientific reduction in stray dog
population.

Right now we are working under the following constraints:

We have been allotted about 2 acres of land by the
Government after 3 years of struggle at the Government
corridors but there are still some hitches like illegal
encroachments, etc to be sorted out and hence we are
forced to continue in the earlier leased place which is
in a dilapidated condition.

We are creating awareness among BMP corporators so that
they understand why we are doing this work in this
particular manner. We have till now managed without bulk
of the contribution coming form private donations but we
need the BMP/Government to give us more
financial/infrastructure support.

OUR FUTURE

We intend to do 2000 ABC/ARVs depending on fund inflow.

Our goal is to make Bangalore Rabies free by year 2005.
This goal has been achieved in 2004 itself.

We intend to promote Veganism as an ideal way of life.

We desire to build a state of art animal hospital by year
2008.

Our mission is to spread awareness among public to live
harmoniously in nature with plants and animal.

What motivated me into Animal Welfare and into forming
ARF?

My tryst with animals began in my childhood. My mother
inculcated in us the values of kindness to animals. In
our house we had a cat and I grew fond of my feline
friends. We became known in the area by our cats and I
felt myself a "cat person". So my life was for the next
two decades. I was an animal lover but not an activist. A
seminar on ritual sacrifice of animals in Mysore, August
1998, changed all that. That was the turning point in my
life when I saw Maneka Gandhi and I have not been the
same person again. Just sharing the same air space as her
and being in the same room as her infected me with her
militancy. Then after that I met another animal-friend
called Dilip Bafna who opened my eyes to veganism (vegans
use no animal products) and just like that -- after
spending the journey back from Mysore with him on the
train changed me completely. I turned vegan the very next
day. I gave up milk, curds, all milk products in one day.
I believed in the fundamental principle behind it. No
other animal drinks the milk of another species the way
man does. Nature did not intend it that way.

ARF was founded on April 5, 1999. We have had a meteoric
rise since. ARF’s work is a test of private enterprise.
We got a head start at Corporation Dog Pound managed by
CUPA and then we opened our ABC Centre without any
government aid. We depend solely on our abilities to work
hard.

Dubbing animal activists as anti-people serves the
motives of a few who do not care for anybody -- neither
for animals nor for people. I have a few friends working
in the field of child welfare who agree that there are
only two sets of people: those who act and those who do
not.

Another interesting aspect of doing animal work is the
effort people put in to convert me from working for
animals to working for humans. I wish they would put
their effort in converting non-workers to workers,
converting somebody who does not do anything for anybody
to someone who does. We should increase the size of the
pie, not fight for the share of it.

When people call me an "activist", I find it amusing,
because I do not understand how anyone can be anything
but that. Life is about action. What is life without
action? How can people not know what they want to do with
their life? If they don’t know, who will?

Poisoning of stray dogs leads to public outcry

gujaratplus.com
Sunday, March 25, 2001

Vadodara - The killing of four street dogs by the VMC
staff by poisoning them in the Rajmahal Road area has led
to a public outcry and protests from animal rights
activists.

Pashu Seva Kendra, an NGO, and Gunda Falia Bal Yuvak
Mandal members filed an FIR with the Raopura police
against one HA Parikh, a resident of Gunda Falia and VMC
official PK Patel on Friday. They said Parikh had a hand
in the 'brutal killing of dogs in the locality'.

"In his complaint, Patel had wrongly alleged that the
dogs were suffering from rabies and were a nuisance to
the residents. Patel instructed his men to poison these
dogs "without trying to find out the truth", fumed a
resident Dharmendra Vasadia. They are planning to write
to Union minister and noted animal rights activist Maneka
Gandhi in this regard.

"Post-mortem report reveals that these dogs were
poisoned. The dogs were healthy and not suffering from
rabies, as alleged by Parikh. The VMC staff can't kill
healthy dogs", said Pashu Seva Kendra managing director
Meena Amin.

"Stray dogs shouldn't be killed. Instead they should be
sterilised and vaccinated. One can't control the number
of street dogs by killing them", said Vadodara Society
for Prevention of Cruelty of Animal (VSPCA) administrator
Kalpana Patel.

She said VMC officials need to look carefully into such
matters. "It is ironical that ward officers didn't even
care to verify the complaint."

But VMC ward number 5 officer Lalsingh Mulley says these
allegations against them are baseless. "According to
Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, there is a provision
which says that VMC can kill any street dog."

What the animal rights activists, non-violent folks and Maneka need to
observe is not the "most gory and brutal manner in which the stray dogs
were electrocuted at Bangalore", but  the fact that Rabies is the most
violent death a person can have.

If there was a terrorist going after your neck, will you propose
non-violence? Rabies is worse than that - it is one of the MOST gory
death for the INNOCENT who is affected by it.

You all can propose a way to CONTAIN this menace. You can have a place
all managed and funded by the pacifists to house and humanely treat all
stray dogs - maybe. What do you think? Also, feed the dogs veggies,
maybe. To expose an entire country to death without responsibility is
something that does not go well with non-violence principles.

Stroke, heart disease and cancers kill millions compared to
the thousands killed by rabies.  The vegetarian lifestyle
leads to amazing reduction in the incidence of those diseases.
Why aren't you discussing those diseases? Do you have a passion

Ahinsa with Attitude: An Interview with Maneka Gandhi

By Mia MacDonald
SATYA Magazine
September 1995

Maneka Gandhi is a member of one of the most famous
families in the world. But it's her work -- not her name
-- that makes her remarkable. Gandhi is an animal rights
and environmental activist who sees no difference between
the two. Based in New Delhi, India, she spoke recently
with Satya about solar energy, animal rights vs. animal
welfare, the wrath of Kali, and love when she visited New
York en route to Chicago, where she addressed a biannual
gathering of Jains.

Q: How did you get interested in animals and the
environment?

A: I actually started by losing an election. Until then I
was a common-or-garden person. I fought an election and
lost at the age of 28 [in 1984]. So when I lost, I
started thinking to myself, suppose I'd won? What would I
have given to India? Why was I fighting this election to
begin with? To give something, not take something. I came
to the thought that I should do what was important for
me, and what was important for me was my son. What was I
doing for him? I was putting away all the material
possessions for him, his cutlery, his crockery, his
linen, his school, his education, his marital life, his
jewelry. But, the essentials: if I couldn't leave him a
glass of water, what was the point of all this? Or if I
couldn't let him cross the street, or if he never saw a
park to play in, or if he couldn't breathe without
wheezing, or if he was ill every second day: I thought
that I must do something. So I started traveling in
India, and I said: "Let me not impose my views." I
started seeing: what is it that people want? How have
they developed? What should happen? And from there I came
into the environment. I discovered the word 'environment'
for myself, and studied and learned and read a lot,
traveled a lot. Then I became the Minister for
Environment (1989-91), and found that the word
'environment' was misspelled on the Ministry's
letterhead! When I became Minister, India had no laws for
the environment -- none.

Q: How did animals become central to your ideas about
environment?

A: I'd always been an animal person, and when my husband
died, I opened an [animal] hospital in the same year in
his memory. But, I'd never thought of fitting it into an
agenda. For me it was something I did because I loved
animals. But the more I studied in the environment
movement, the more I thought: "Why should animals be
separate, and especially in a country where animals run
the country?" If I remove the cow, we're all dead. It's a
cow dung economy; it's not an open or closed or
democratic or communist economy. If you remove the cattle
from it, you might as well pack it all in, because
there's nothing else. If you remove the cow, you need
buses to bring things to market, and you don't have them.
If you remove the cow, you need gas cylinders to cook on,
which you don't have. If you remove the cow, you need
pesticide and fertilizer. If you remove the cow you need
something other than milk. Everything ties in right back
to the cow, the buffalo, the bullock, the horse, the
camel, the elephant, the dog -- which is one of the
biggest scavengers of the city -- the vulture, another
big scavenger. Everything has its place, except man. So
then I thought that since nobody else is going to do it,
I must bring animals into the environment movement.

Q: Can you describe the scope of the work you do?

A: I run an NGO [non-governmental organization] called
People for Animals, which is an umbrella organization for
practically all the animal work in India. We make
shelters ourselves and fund other shelters. I also go
around India and set up shelters. I get land from state
governments and try and arrange money; I get animal
groups organized to run the shelters. We have shelters
coming up in lots of parts of India. We also put cases in
court against animal cruelties. For instance, I have a
case in court now against using animals in the circus,
which is coming up for a hearing next month. And I have
another one for zoos selling animals to the circus. We
just won a case against the slaughterhouse in Delhi which
had to shut down because it was perpetuating so much
cruelty. I'm the chairperson of the SPCA, and that
involves inspections. I have 75 inspectors who patrol
Delhi and have the power to give summonses. We prevent
cruelties. We catch trucks which are overloading meat
animals. And I run a hospital of my own in Delhi, a
shelter, called the Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Center. I'm
setting up another one for People for Animals which is
the biggest goshala, or cow shelter, in India. It will
have about 10,000 cows. It's already got about 600 cows,
the stray cows of Delhi.

Q: What are some of your current campaigns?

A: We are working on something called "Artists for
Animals" where we're making every film star sign a pledge
that they won't work with animals. It's getting to be too
much: they're shooting pigeons on screen, tripping
horses, and they have tigers with their mouths sewn up,
fighting with these macho stars. Then I have taken on the
stopping of dog killing. About two to three million dogs
are being killed every year in India because they are
strays, supposedly to stop rabies. It has no effect
whatsoever. So now we are trying to stop that program and
replace it with sterilization and vaccination.

Q: You are a very well-known person in India. How do you
use that notoriety to further your causes?

A: I do a column called "Heads &amp; Tails" every week for
about 30 newspapers, and that's been collected into a
book. I have two TV shows. One is called "Heads &amp; Tails".
It's the Ahinsa show, in the sense that it shows animal
cruelties, and shows people who are doing good work. It
shows what you can do. I have another TV show on
environment, a six-minute show every week after the news
on Sunday, which says that, for instance, when you use
aluminum foil, you kill the tiger. The bauxite is mined
in the Bihar forest. The Bihar forest houses the tigers;
the big cat is killed first when mining starts. It shows
you the inter-relationships, the house of cards effect;
how the aluminum was mined and where.

Q: Was it hard to start work on these issues in a
developing country, where there are so many pressing
human needs?

A: For me, it wasn't a decision that was made looking at
anything except the need -- whose need was greater? And
then who would take it up? You know, it's very easy to do
[work with] children, because that's politically correct.
If I hadn't come into it, quite honestly, nobody would
have. It has to be one person who's confident enough to
say, "I don't care what you say, it has to be what I know
to be true." People in politics say: "You don't do for
people, you do for animals? Where will your votes come
from?" Really, it [the work] has a vote multiplier
effect, because you're seen as good.

Q: You are the most visible person in India, in all of
the developing world, doing work like this. How much
support do you find for your work?

A: Well, I have a great deal of support. What kind of
support it is, I don't know, because I have no idea what
to do with the support! I'm only learning very painfully,
and it's taking a long time, to be an organization
person. I have about 30,000 members in People for
Animals. I get about 80 letters a day, and those are work
letters: "Can we donate land? Can we help?" But the point
is, how does it translate? [The setting up] of bureaus
and units is coming, but it's coming very painfully.
State governments are very supportive, in the sense that
if I want something, I get it. I don't know whether it's
the work I do or who I am, but if I want land, I get it;
if I want the government to stop something, it's done.

Q: How important is vegetarianism to you and the work you
do?

A: I came to environment, then took up animals, and then
from there I decided that it is not just "animals' work"
-- you had to be vegetarian. I couldn't go around saving
the one cat and one dog, which is what people mean when
they say 'animals', it had to be saving the meat animals,
or rather preventing them from being born. So, I had to
do vegetarianism. I had to do Ahinsa which fitted the
whole thing, the whole catchall phrase of environment,
animals, vegetarianism. Everything comes into Ahinsa.

Q: What do you think about the term 'animal rights'?

A: I think it's very important. But it shouldn't be
separated from animal welfare. In America, because you're
so rich, and you're so bored, you invent debates, for
instance the debate about abortion. It's so non-sensical.
We're amazed that you people should be burning abortion
clinics and killing abortion people. The debate is so
irrelevant to the rest of the world. If you want to have
an abortion, have it. If you don't want to have it, don't
have it. Why do you make a thing about it? And why lobby,
and why go to Congress? The right of a person to their
own body is the first right, before anything else. So,
the same way, now you've invented the debate between
animal rights and animal welfare. How can we separate the
two? My child's right is to live, therefore I must look
after the child. So, welfare is tied into rights. If I
were to leave a one-day old baby and say: "Right, now
it's your life's right to

"Stroke, heart disease and cancers kill millions compared to
the thousands killed by rabies."

- These are manageable diseases and almost completely caused by
lifestyle of the PERSON who is involved. It is not really a social
cause. If you want to eat meat or veggies, that is YOUR OWN CHOICE.

99% Rabies cases in India is caused by DOGS in the STREET. Taking dogs
off the street is a public responsibility. It kills innocent children,
tax-paying citizens, people of all sizes and shapes. It is a SOCIAL
CAUSE in INDIA, since INDIA ACCOUNTS FOR 30000 of the annual
40000-50000 deaths caused by this HORRIBLE DISEASE.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;The vegetarian lifestyle leads to amazing reduction in the incidence of &gt;those diseases.&quot;
">

Jay, another wrong statement, but debatable. It is about fat,
carbohydrates, etc. Veggie lifestyle is ok, but I was pointing it out
to you that killing dogs or containing them does not necessarily affect
your veggie views of non-violence towards animals.

"Why aren't you discussing those diseases? Do you have a passion
for killing animals?  (I suspect not.)"

RABIES is caused by DOGS (99%) in India. The Stroke, heart disease and
cancers are caused by a PERSON's lifestyle. I do not have a passion
either for killing (or more importantly) NOT KILLING an anmial WHEN IT
IS A PUBLIC THREAT.

(According to your arguments, a tiger in Bombay will be allowed to roam
the streets and eat the best child it can find!)

"About two to three million dogs are being killed every
year in India because they are strays, supposedly to stop
rabies. It has no effect whatsoever. So now we are trying
to stop that program and replace it with sterilization
and vaccination."  - Maneka Gandhi

This is NOT a fact. Maneka is lying. All stray dogs are not being
completely handled and that is why we have a problem. It is VERY
IRRESPONSIBLE to send stray dogs BACK into the street. You can house
them in your homes if YOU CHOOSE, or take it OUT OFF THE STREET (To
anywhere it is contained including DOG HEAVEN). AN UNLEASHED DOG IN THE
STREET is a PUBLIC THREAT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD - ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF

If the practice according to one's choice negatively
affects the environment and valuable resources, then it
becomes everyone's concern.  The animal eating habit is
one such destructive choice:

MEAT-EATERS HURT THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES AND OTHERS

* The raw materials needed for food production from
livestock exceed all oil, gas and coal consumption.

* Producing least-efficient plant-based food is 10 times
more efficient than producing most-efficient animal-based
food.

* A Vegetarian diet will cut oil imports by over 60% and
supply of renewable energy will increase 120-150%.

* Meat-eaters have higher blood pressure, are more
hypertensive and violent.  Public funds are used for
research and treatment.  Everyone is forced to pay the
price of violence and crime.

*  There is overwhelming evidence the the meat-eating
habit causes stroke and heart diseases.  Public funds are
used for research and treatment.

* Red meat causes colon cancer, #2 cause of cancer in the
U.S.  Meat-eaters are 2-1/2 times more likely to get it.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* The meat-eating habit kills rain forests, 38% of all
rain forests destroyed in Brazil because of it.

* The meat habit kills our supply of medicines, about a
fourth of them come from tropical rain forests.

* The beef diet causes excess carbon dioxide and global
warming as forests are burned for the U.S. meat habit.

* Meat-eaters have double the bone loss; vegetarians have
significantly stronger bones.  Public funds are used for
research and treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis and
other bone-related diseases.

* The meat diet's excess protein causes calcium loss
which causes painful kidney stones in meat-eaters. Public
funds are used for research and treatment.

* Animal foods are the major source of pesticides. Of
all, 95-99% are in meat, fish, eggs and dairy items.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* The production of meat, eggs, dairy items accounts for
33% of all raw materials.  Plant-based foods will use 5%.

* The meat-eating habit dumps twice the pollutants as
released by all U.S. industrial sources. 1 billion tons a
year.

* Cancer-causing, deadly toxaphene is used for dipping
cattle.  Toxaphene is retained in animal flesh.  Public
funds are used for research and treatment.

* Hormones added to animals increase profits but cause
cancer, impotence, infertility and other illnesses.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* One acre of land can grow 20,000 pounds of potatoes but
less than 165 pounds of beef.

* The meat, including poultry, sold today is grossly
infected with both coliform bacteria and salmonella.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* Fruits and vegetables are great medicines by
themselves, unlike animal-based foods.  Meat-eaters cause
public funds to be used for medical research and
treatment.

* Meat-eating causes obesity, a significant co-factor in
all crippling degenerative diseases.  Public funds are
used for research and treatment.

* U.S. livestock consumes enough grain and soybeans to
feed over 5 times the entire U.S. human population.

* Diet-style changes would not only halt the process of
deforestation, they would actually reverse it.

* Women's risk of breast cancer rises dramatically with
their intake of meat.  Public funds are used for research
and treatment.

* The most effective way of minimizing pesticide intake
is to eliminate meats, fish, dairy products and eggs.

WHAT IS RABIES?

Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous,system
of mammals. In the last stages of the disease, the virus
moves from the brain into the salivary glands and saliva.
From there the virus can be transmitted through a bite or
by contact with mucous membranes (nose, mouth, and eyes).
It is fatal once symptoms occur. Dogs can be infectious
to others for as long as 2 weeks before the symptoms of
the disease appear, hence the need to confine and observe
suspect animals.

WHAT SPECIES ARE THE MAJOR CARRIERS OF RABIES?

Rabies is predominantly a disease of wild carnivores but
it can affect all mammals. including humans. Different
species have become the main carriers (vectors) in
different areas of the world: dogs in Asia, Africa, the
Middle East, and Latin America; foxes in western Europe
and parts of the United States and Canada; raccoons in
the eastern United States and Ontario, Canada; bats in
North and South America and southeast Asia; mongooses in
South Africa.

Marsupials are much less susceptible to rabies than
placental mammals. In the U.S., for example, opossums
commonly share habitat and food sources with raccoons,
but are virtually never infected. Rodents are relatively
easily infected with rabies, but typically die so quickly
that they are rarely involved in spreading outbreaks.

HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED?

Rabies is caused by rhabdovirus -- a large enveloped
bullet-shaped DNA virus. It is very sensitive to heat,
light detergents (including ordinary soaps) and
disinfectants and cannot survive for long outside the
body of an infected animal.

The virus is carried in the saliva of an infected animal.
It cannot penetrate intact skin. It can be transmitted by
licking when animals groom each other in a manner which
allows the saliva of an infected animal to come in
contact with an open wound. This is believed to be a
common method of transmission among raccoons, among whom
mutual grooming by family members is routine, but is not
considered common among other vector species.

The virus multiplies at the site of the bite, invades
nerve fibres, and travels to the brain. The incubation
period (the time between the bite and the onset of
symptoms) is related to the distance of the wound from
the head and neck: the nearer the head, the shorter the
incubation. Bites to the head and neck carry the highest
risk. This has relevance to the efficacy of post exposure
therapy. Growth of the virus in the brain causes severe
nervous degeneration and eventually death. The virus also
spreads from the brain along other nerves to organs
including the salivary glands, where the virus is
excreted in the saliva. Bites in general are high-risk
exposures. Animal contact by itself -- such as being in
the vicinity of a rabid animal, petting or handling a
rabid animal, or coming into contact with the blood,
urine or feces of a rabid animal -- does not usually
constitute exposure and, therefore, does not usually
require post-exposure rabies treatment. The exception is
if fresh, warm saliva may have been transmitted into an
open wound.

Exposure of a human to a rabid animal does not always
result in rabies. If prevention treatment is obtained
promptly following a rabies exposure, most cases of
rabies will be prevented. All animal bites should be
evaluated by a health professional to determine if
treatment is necessary.

WHO CAN SPREAD RABIES?

The rabies virus can infect any mammal, but infection is
most common among dogs, cats, cows, horses, bats, skunks,
foxes, and raccoons, who have in common a relatively long
latency interval between exposure and the time symptoms
appear. Transmission usually occurs while the vector
animal (the animal carrying the disease) is in the latent
phase (before symptoms appear).

Though it is thought to happen rarely, rabies can also be
spread by animals eating the freshly killed carcasses of
infected animals.

HOW CAN PEOPLE BE PROTECTED AGAINST RABIES?

The best protection against rabies is for people to
vaccinate their pets and any street dogs or cats living
near their homes, and for city authorities to conduct
mass vaccination campaigns for street dogs and cats,
ideally humanely sterilizing (spaying or castrating) the
animals at the same time. Killing animals has never been
effective in preventing the spread of rabies.

In regions where bat rabies occurs, one should avoid
allowing bats to roost in human sleeping areas. Bat
transmissions of rabies typically occur through
accidental nocturnal contact, and as bat fangs typically
leave marks no larger and no more uncomfortable than
mosquito bites, the victims are frequently unaware that
they have been bitten.

IS RABIES CURABLE?

There is no cure once the signs of rabies appear. It is
then inevitably fatal. However, the relatively long
incubation period allows post-exposure therapy to be
effective if done correctly.

WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF RABIES IN ANIMALS?

Symptoms of rabies in animals may include any one or more
of the following signs: excitability; vicious behavior or
attacks; biting; agitation; restlessness;
uncharacteristic aggression; fearlessness; excessive
salivation (so-called frothing at the mouth); aversion to
water (where the name "hydrophobia" comes from);
inability to swallow or drink; dilated pupils; muscular
dysfunction; coordination or gait irregularities;
paralysis; convulsions; and eventually death, almost
always within 10 days. These symptoms are referred to as
furious rabies.

Some rabid animals do not exhibit typical rabid symptoms.
This are generally referred to as dumb rabies. These
animals may display other symptoms of general illness
which may include an avoidance of contact with humans or
other animals, lethargy, loss of appetite, and eventually
death. Some dogs just howl for days and retreat into dark
corners. Their hind legs may give way. A dog may show
very mild symptoms of anorexia (not eating) and
listlessness only, and is found dead in three or four
days. Sometimes the dog shows no signs at all, yet is
suddenly found dead, and a post-mortem examination
reveals rabies.

ARE THESE SYMPTOMS CHARACTERISTIC OF RABIES ONLY?

Unfortunately not. Extreme pain, fear or confusion can
make an animal aggressive. Profuse salivation and the
inability to swallow may result from obstruction in the
throat, foreign bodies in the teeth, or the ingestion of
irritating or toxic substances. Howling could be due to
hunger, fear, or pain. Tetanus infections may sometimes
be misdiagnosed as rabies. But, in any case, such animals
should also be approached with caution as in their pain
they may attack.

At present, rabies can only be positively diagnosed by
testing the brain of an infected animal, and this must be
done at an appropriate laboratory. There are no tests
currently available to definitively diagnose rabies in a
live animal.

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF RABIES IN HUMANS?

Early symptoms in humans include irritability,
inexplicable depression, headache, fever, and sometimes
itching or pain at the site of exposure. The disease
eventually progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat
muscles, convulsions, delirium, and death. It is
important to note that once symptoms appear, rabies
cannot be successfully treated.

HOW SOON AFTER INFECTION DO SYMPTOMS APPEAR?

The incubation period (the time between exposure and the
onset of symptoms) is variable but is normally 3 to 8
weeks in humans. In dogs, the incubation period is
normally between 21 to 80 days, but it may be shorter or
longer.

WHEN AND FOR HOW LONG IS A PERSON ABLE TO SPREAD RABIES?

Person to person transmission is extremely rare, but
precautions should be taken to prevent exposure to the
saliva of the diseased person, including saliva in
aerosol form from coughing, sneezing, or spitting.

WHAT TREATMENT IS NEEDED AFTER EXPOSURE TO RABIES?

Exposure to a rabid animal does not always result in
rabies. If treatment is obtained promptly following a
rabies exposure, most cases of rabies will be prevented.
All animal bites should be evaluated by a health
professional to determine if treatment is necessary.

The most effective rabies prevention is immediate and
thorough cleansing of the site of the animal bite or
scratch wounds with liberal amounts of soap and water, or
flushing mucous membranes with warm water. If the wound
is bleeding profusely, apply pressure with fingers or
hands, or apply a pressure bandage. The wound should not
be sutured, as this is thought to increase the risk of
the virus entering nerves.

This is followed by the administration of an injection of
HRIG (human anti-rabies immune globulin) and five doses
of human diploid cell rabies vaccine administered in the
arm on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after exposure. In some
places, multiple site intradermal (within the skin)
injection protocols are being used successfully and are
cheaper than the standard intramuscular (within the
muscle) post-exposure vaccination program, as they
require less antigen. The old fashioned and inhumane
vaccines of animal brain origin that were injected into
the stomach have now been replaced in most parts of the
world by more effective and safer tissue culture
vaccines. The first injection is an antibody to fight the
virus, and the rest of the injections are a vaccine to
ensure long lasting protection. Post-exposure therapy is
required even by those people who have received
prophylactic vaccination (pre-exposure vaccination);
however,

Ahinsa with Attitude: An Interview with Maneka Gandhi

By Mia MacDonald
SATYA Magazine
September 1995

Maneka Gandhi is a member of one of the most famous
families in the world. But it's her work -- not her name
-- that makes her remarkable. Gandhi is an animal rights
and environmental activist who sees no difference between
the two. Based in New Delhi, India, she spoke recently
with Satya about solar energy, animal rights vs. animal
welfare, the wrath of Kali, and love when she visited New
York en route to Chicago, where she addressed a biannual
gathering of Jains.

Q: How did you get interested in animals and the
environment?

A: I actually started by losing an election. Until then I
was a common-or-garden person. I fought an election and
lost at the age of 28 [in 1984]. So when I lost, I
started thinking to myself, suppose I'd won? What would I
have given to India? Why was I fighting this election to
begin with? To give something, not take something. I came
to the thought that I should do what was important for
me, and what was important for me was my son. What was I
doing for him? I was putting away all the material
possessions for him, his cutlery, his crockery, his
linen, his school, his education, his marital life, his
jewelry. But, the essentials: if I couldn't leave him a
glass of water, what was the point of all this? Or if I
couldn't let him cross the street, or if he never saw a
park to play in, or if he couldn't breathe without
wheezing, or if he was ill every second day: I thought
that I must do something. So I started traveling in
India, and I said: "Let me not impose my views." I
started seeing: what is it that people want? How have
they developed? What should happen? And from there I came
into the environment. I discovered the word 'environment'
for myself, and studied and learned and read a lot,
traveled a lot. Then I became the Minister for
Environment (1989-91), and found that the word
'environment' was misspelled on the Ministry's
letterhead! When I became Minister, India had no laws for
the environment -- none.

Q: How did animals become central to your ideas about
environment?

A: I'd always been an animal person, and when my husband
died, I opened an [animal] hospital in the same year in
his memory. But, I'd never thought of fitting it into an
agenda. For me it was something I did because I loved
animals. But the more I studied in the environment
movement, the more I thought: "Why should animals be
separate, and especially in a country where animals run
the country?" If I remove the cow, we're all dead. It's a
cow dung economy; it's not an open or closed or
democratic or communist economy. If you remove the cattle
from it, you might as well pack it all in, because
there's nothing else. If you remove the cow, you need
buses to bring things to market, and you don't have them.
If you remove the cow, you need gas cylinders to cook on,
which you don't have. If you remove the cow, you need
pesticide and fertilizer. If you remove the cow you need
something other than milk. Everything ties in right back
to the cow, the buffalo, the bullock, the horse, the
camel, the elephant, the dog -- which is one of the
biggest scavengers of the city -- the vulture, another
big scavenger. Everything has its place, except man. So
then I thought that since nobody else is going to do it,
I must bring animals into the environment movement.

Q: Can you describe the scope of the work you do?

A: I run an NGO [non-governmental organization] called
People for Animals, which is an umbrella organization for
practically all the animal work in India. We make
shelters ourselves and fund other shelters. I also go
around India and set up shelters. I get land from state
governments and try and arrange money; I get animal
groups organized to run the shelters. We have shelters
coming up in lots of parts of India. We also put cases in
court against animal cruelties. For instance, I have a
case in court now against using animals in the circus,
which is coming up for a hearing next month. And I have
another one for zoos selling animals to the circus. We
just won a case against the slaughterhouse in Delhi which
had to shut down because it was perpetuating so much
cruelty. I'm the chairperson of the SPCA, and that
involves inspections. I have 75 inspectors who patrol
Delhi and have the power to give summonses. We prevent
cruelties. We catch trucks which are overloading meat
animals. And I run a hospital of my own in Delhi, a
shelter, called the Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Center. I'm
setting up another one for People for Animals which is
the biggest goshala, or cow shelter, in India. It will
have about 10,000 cows. It's already got about 600 cows,
the stray cows of Delhi.

Q: What are some of your current campaigns?

A: We are working on something called "Artists for
Animals" where we're making every film star sign a pledge
that they won't work with animals. It's getting to be too
much: they're shooting pigeons on screen, tripping
horses, and they have tigers with their mouths sewn up,
fighting with these macho stars. Then I have taken on the
stopping of dog killing. About two to three million dogs
are being killed every year in India because they are
strays, supposedly to stop rabies. It has no effect
whatsoever. So now we are trying to stop that program and
replace it with sterilization and vaccination.

Q: You are a very well-known person in India. How do you
use that notoriety to further your causes?

A: I do a column called "Heads &amp; Tails" every week for
about 30 newspapers, and that's been collected into a
book. I have two TV shows. One is called "Heads &amp; Tails".
It's the Ahinsa show, in the sense that it shows animal
cruelties, and shows people who are doing good work. It
shows what you can do. I have another TV show on
environment, a six-minute show every week after the news
on Sunday, which says that, for instance, when you use
aluminum foil, you kill the tiger. The bauxite is mined
in the Bihar forest. The Bihar forest houses the tigers;
the big cat is killed first when mining starts. It shows
you the inter-relationships, the house of cards effect;
how the aluminum was mined and where.

Q: Was it hard to start work on these issues in a
developing country, where there are so many pressing
human needs?

A: For me, it wasn't a decision that was made looking at
anything except the need -- whose need was greater? And
then who would take it up? You know, it's very easy to do
[work with] children, because that's politically correct.
If I hadn't come into it, quite honestly, nobody would
have. It has to be one person who's confident enough to
say, "I don't care what you say, it has to be what I know
to be true." People in politics say: "You don't do for
people, you do for animals? Where will your votes come
from?" Really, it [the work] has a vote multiplier
effect, because you're seen as good.

Q: You are the most visible person in India, in all of
the developing world, doing work like this. How much
support do you find for your work?

A: Well, I have a great deal of support. What kind of
support it is, I don't know, because I have no idea what
to do with the support! I'm only learning very painfully,
and it's taking a long time, to be an organization
person. I have about 30,000 members in People for
Animals. I get about 80 letters a day, and those are work
letters: "Can we donate land? Can we help?" But the point
is, how does it translate? [The setting up] of bureaus
and units is coming, but it's coming very painfully.
State governments are very supportive, in the sense that
if I want something, I get it. I don't know whether it's
the work I do or who I am, but if I want land, I get it;
if I want the government to stop something, it's done.

Q: How important is vegetarianism to you and the work you
do?

A: I came to environment, then took up animals, and then
from there I decided that it is not just "animals' work"
-- you had to be vegetarian. I couldn't go around saving
the one cat and one dog, which is what people mean when
they say 'animals', it had to be saving the meat animals,
or rather preventing them from being born. So, I had to
do vegetarianism. I had to do Ahinsa which fitted the
whole thing, the whole catchall phrase of environment,
animals, vegetarianism. Everything comes into Ahinsa.

Q: What do you think about the term 'animal rights'?

A: I think it's very important. But it shouldn't be
separated from animal welfare. In America, because you're
so rich, and you're so bored, you invent debates, for
instance the debate about abortion. It's so non-sensical.
We're amazed that you people should be burning abortion
clinics and killing abortion people. The debate is so
irrelevant to the rest of the world. If you want to have
an abortion, have it. If you don't want to have it, don't
have it. Why do you make a thing about it? And why lobby,
and why go to Congress? The right of a person to their
own body is the first right, before anything else. So,
the same way, now you've invented the debate between
animal rights and animal welfare. How can we separate the
two? My child's right is to live, therefore I must look
after the child. So, welfare is tied into rights. If I
were to leave a one-day old baby and say: "Right, now
it's your life's right to

If the practice according to one's choice negatively

becomes everyone's concern.  The animal eating habit is
one such destructive choice:

MEAT-EATERS HURT THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES AND OTHERS

* The raw materials needed for food production from
livestock exceed all oil, gas and coal consumption.

* Producing least-efficient plant-based food is 10 times
more efficient than producing most-efficient animal-based
food.

* A Vegetarian diet will cut oil imports by over 60% and
supply of renewable energy will increase 120-150%.

* Meat-eaters have higher blood pressure, are more
hypertensive and violent.  Public funds are used for
research and treatment.  Everyone is forced to pay the
price of violence and crime.

*  There is overwhelming evidence the the meat-eating
habit causes stroke and heart diseases.  Public funds are
used for research and treatment.

* Red meat causes colon cancer, #2 cause of cancer in the
U.S.  Meat-eaters are 2-1/2 times more likely to get it.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* The meat-eating habit kills rain forests, 38% of all
rain forests destroyed in Brazil because of it.

* The meat habit kills our supply of medicines, about a
fourth of them come from tropical rain forests.

* The beef diet causes excess carbon dioxide and global
warming as forests are burned for the U.S. meat habit.

* Meat-eaters have double the bone loss; vegetarians have
significantly stronger bones.  Public funds are used for
research and treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis and
other bone-related diseases.

* The meat diet's excess protein causes calcium loss
which causes painful kidney stones in meat-eaters. Public
funds are used for research and treatment.

* Animal foods are the major source of pesticides. Of
all, 95-99% are in meat, fish, eggs and dairy items.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* The production of meat, eggs, dairy items accounts for
33% of all raw materials.  Plant-based foods will use 5%.

* The meat-eating habit dumps twice the pollutants as
released by all U.S. industrial sources. 1 billion tons a
year.

* Cancer-causing, deadly toxaphene is used for dipping
cattle.  Toxaphene is retained in animal flesh.  Public
funds are used for research and treatment.

* Hormones added to animals increase profits but cause
cancer, impotence, infertility and other illnesses.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* One acre of land can grow 20,000 pounds of potatoes but
less than 165 pounds of beef.

* The meat, including poultry, sold today is grossly
infected with both coliform bacteria and salmonella.
Public funds are used for research and treatment.

* Fruits and vegetables are great medicines by
themselves, unlike animal-based foods.  Meat-eaters cause
public funds to be used for medical research and
treatment.

* Meat-eating causes obesity, a significant co-factor in
all crippling degenerative diseases.  Public funds are
used for research and treatment.

* U.S. livestock consumes enough grain and soybeans to
feed over 5 times the entire U.S. human population.

* Diet-style changes would not only halt the process of
deforestation, they would actually reverse it.

* Women's risk of breast cancer rises dramatically with
their intake of meat.  Public funds are used for research
and treatment.

* The most effective way of minimizing pesticide intake
is to eliminate meats, fish, dairy products and eggs.

Poisoning of stray dogs leads to public outcry

gujaratplus.com
Sunday, March 25, 2001

Vadodara - The killing of four street dogs by the VMC
staff by poisoning them in the Rajmahal Road area has led
to a public outcry and protests from animal rights
activists.

Pashu Seva Kendra, an NGO, and Gunda Falia Bal Yuvak
Mandal members filed an FIR with the Raopura police
against one HA Parikh, a resident of Gunda Falia and VMC
official PK Patel on Friday. They said Parikh had a hand
in the 'brutal killing of dogs in the locality'.

"In his complaint, Patel had wrongly alleged that the
dogs were suffering from rabies and were a nuisance to
the residents. Patel instructed his men to poison these
dogs "without trying to find out the truth", fumed a
resident Dharmendra Vasadia. They are planning to write
to Union minister and noted animal rights activist Maneka
Gandhi in this regard.

"Post-mortem report reveals that these dogs were
poisoned. The dogs were healthy and not suffering from
rabies, as alleged by Parikh. The VMC staff can't kill
healthy dogs", said Pashu Seva Kendra managing director
Meena Amin.

"Stray dogs shouldn't be killed. Instead they should be
sterilised and vaccinated. One can't control the number
of street dogs by killing them", said Vadodara Society
for Prevention of Cruelty of Animal (VSPCA) administrator
Kalpana Patel.

She said VMC officials need to look carefully into such
matters. "It is ironical that ward officers didn't even
care to verify the complaint."

But VMC ward number 5 officer Lalsingh Mulley says these
allegations against them are baseless. "According to
Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, there is a provision
which says that VMC can kill any street dog."

&gt; the govt, that lives on the hindu taxpayers' money, has the sacred duty to
&gt; respect the wishes of people on such moral issue of the hindus. in this case
&gt; the stray dogs should have been spayed and cared for in facilities that
&gt; already exist. when missionaries are out and about, bad influences are
&gt; likely to be in the air. the town needs to washed with gangajal.

&gt; &gt; Poisoning of stray dogs leads to public outcry

&gt; &gt; Sunday, March 25, 2001

&gt; &gt; Vadodara - The killing of four street dogs by the VMC
&gt; &gt; staff by poisoning them in the Rajmahal Road area has led
&gt; &gt; to a public outcry and protests from animal rights
&gt; &gt; activists.

&gt; &gt; Pashu Seva Kendra, an NGO, and Gunda Falia Bal Yuvak
&gt; &gt; Mandal members filed an FIR with the Raopura police
&gt; &gt; against one HA Parikh, a resident of Gunda Falia and VMC
&gt; &gt; official PK Patel on Friday. They said Parikh had a hand
&gt; &gt; in the 'brutal killing of dogs in the locality'.

&gt; &gt; &quot;In his complaint, Patel had wrongly alleged that the
&gt; &gt; dogs were suffering from rabies and were a nuisance to
&gt; &gt; the residents. Patel instructed his men to poison these
&gt; &gt; dogs &quot;without trying to find out the truth&quot;, fumed a
&gt; &gt; resident Dharmendra Vasadia. They are planning to write
&gt; &gt; to Union minister and noted animal rights activist Maneka
&gt; &gt; Gandhi in this regard.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Post-mortem report reveals that these dogs were
&gt; &gt; poisoned. The dogs were healthy and not suffering from
&gt; &gt; rabies, as alleged by Parikh. The VMC staff can't kill
&gt; &gt; healthy dogs&quot;, said Pashu Seva Kendra managing director
&gt; &gt; Meena Amin.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Stray dogs shouldn't be killed. Instead they should be
&gt; &gt; sterilised and vaccinated. One can't control the number
&gt; &gt; of street dogs by killing them&quot;, said Vadodara Society
&gt; &gt; for Prevention of Cruelty of Animal (VSPCA) administrator
&gt; &gt; Kalpana Patel.

&gt; &gt; She said VMC officials need to look carefully into such
&gt; &gt; matters. &quot;It is ironical that ward officers didn't even
&gt; &gt; care to verify the complaint.&quot;

&gt; &gt; But VMC ward number 5 officer Lalsingh Mulley says these
&gt; &gt; allegations against them are baseless. &quot;According to
&gt; &gt; Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, there is a provision
&gt; &gt; which says that VMC can kill any street dog.&quot;

The Indian government is run by taxes paid by people of all
backgrounds, castes and religions. However, respecting the wishes of
SOME Brahmins to keep cows and dogs on the street is where the problem
is.

Granted cows only delay people on the street, and possibly impale a FEW
indians (and do not spread rabies). The DOGS are dangerous creatures -
and RABIES is the MOST DANGEROUS DISEASE KNOWN TO MAN.

If you have ever been attacked by a pack of 20 dogs, you will
understand what I mean. Dogs are not of ANY social or religious
significance that is worthy or respect.
