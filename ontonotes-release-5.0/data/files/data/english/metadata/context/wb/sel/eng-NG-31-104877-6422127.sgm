David Copperfield. XXI. Little Em'ly
.
'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you remember what
you told me once, about her making all the apple pasties
and doing all the cooking''
'Yes, very well,' I returned.
.
'It was as TRUE,' said Mr. Barkis, 'as *TURNIPS* is. It was as TRUE,'
said Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, which was his only means
of emphasis, 'as taxes is. And NOTHING's TRUER THAN THEM.'
Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, as if for my assent
to this result of his reflections in bed; and I gave it.

'NOTHING's TRUER THAN THEM,' repeated Mr. Barkis; 'a man as poor
as I am finds that out in his mind when he's laid up.
I'm a very poor man, Sir.'
'I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.'
'A very poor man, indeed I am,' said Mr. Barkis.

HERE his right hand came slowly and FEEBLY from under the bed-clothes,
and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was
loosely tied to the side of the bed. After some poking about with this
instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of
distracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked it against a box,
an end of which had been visible to me all the time.
Then his face became composed.

Pint-size Lucifer "PAPPY" YOKUM had the misfortune of being the
patriarch in a family completely dominated by his better half,
Pansy "MAMmy" Yokum. On the other hand, Pappy didn't seem to
complain. He had a free ride for many years. MAMmy did all the
household chores and provided her family with no less than
eight meals a day. Ostensibly a TURNIP farmer, Pappy was rarely
seen working. In fact, he was so lazy, he didn't even bathe
himself. MAMmy was regularly seen lathering and scrubbing Pappy
in an outdoor oak tub next to the modest Yokum log cabin.
Clipping Pappy's toe nails fell under her wifely duties as well.
While MAMmy was the unofficial mayor of Dogpatch and could read,
Pappy was illiterate. MAMmy was smart (by Dogpatch standards).
Pappy was dull-witted and gullible.

&lt;&lt;Dubbed "TURNIP Head" by Sophie in Howl's Moving Castle, this
scarecrow was under a powerful spell. After Sophie frees him from
a bush (he has a habit of landing in places upside down, and getting
stuck), he follows her around, continually doing kind things for her.
He even gets to be a hero, saving the lives of Sophie, Markl,
Heen and the Witch when the Castle falls apart. When his spell
is lifted by Sophie's kiss, and he turns out to be a prince,
he's a little disappointed that Sophie's love belongs to Howl.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The TURNIP garden vegetable native to Europe,
the root is used for both human consumption &amp; stock fodder.
The two main types are the white (BRASSica Rapa)
and the yellow (BRASSica napoBRASSica)(a.k.a., the rutabaga).
.
In Britain the white &amp; yellow varieties are often
confused between the north &amp; the south of the country.
.
In the north of England &amp; Scotland
the larger yellow vegetable is called the TURNIP,
and the smaller white variety is a *SWEDE* .
.
The south of England reverses this distinction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&lt;&lt;R. J. Valentine writes:  &quot;This phrase &quot;fall off a TURNIP truck&quot;
">

has been used for many years by Johnny Carson, who hosted _The
Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ on NBC from the early 1960s to
the early 1990s.  He used it in precisely in the context discussed.
He may not have originated it, but he certainly popularized it,
and began doing so long before 1985."
.
Evan Morris, at http://www.word-detective.com/back-o.html#TURNIP ,
says that this phrase "seems to be a good example of an entire class
of catch phrases based on urban-rural rivalry.  The thrust of such
phrases is, of course, that 'I am not a fool or a newcomer,' and,
in this case, that 'I am not *AN IGNORANT COUNTRY BUMPKIN*
who just arrived in the big city on a truck full of lowly TURNIPs
that I was dumb enough, on top of everything else, to fall off of.'
This image of a bewildered hayseed ripe for fleecing by urban con
artists is a close relative of more general phrases used to assert
one's 'insider status' and thus intelligence or savvy.&gt;&gt;

After that it did not seem strange when next day the PIGs who were
supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.
It did not seem strange to learn that the PIGs had bought themselves
a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, &amp; had taken
out subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror.
It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the
farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth-no, not even when
the PIGs took Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and
put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat,
ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite
sow appeared in the watered silk dress which
Mrs. Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.
.
A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to
the farm. A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited
to make a tour of inspection. They were shown all over the farm,
and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially
the windmill. The animals were weeding the TURNIP field.
They worked diligently hardly raising their faces from
the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened
of the PIGs or of the human visitors.

1.2185: There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the
fields in the country where they digged up TURNIPs to peel them and eat
them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, the smell there
was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were.

A LITTLE more of the novel did rest unread, when Sancho Panza, all
perplexed, ran out of the chamber where his lord reposed, crying as
loud as he could, 'Come, good sirs, speedily, and assist my lord,
who is engaged in one of the most terrible battles that ever mine
eyes have seen. I swear that he hath given such a blow to
the giant, my lady the Princess Micomicona her enemy,

What happened to Sancho in Walking the Round in his Island
.
With this the governor was well pleased, and very greedily expected the
coming of the night and suppertime; and though time, as he thought,
stood still, not moving a jot from his place, yet at length it came, so
longed for by him, and he had to supper a cold mincemeat of beef and
onions, with a calves-foot somewhat stale, and fell to as contentedly as
if they had given him a godwit of Milan, or a pheasant of Rome, or veal
of Sorrentum, or partridges of Moron, or geese of Lavaxos; and in the
midst of his supper he turned to the doctor and said, 'Look ye, master
doctor, henceforward never care to give me dainties or exquisite meats
to eat; for you will pluck my stomach quite off the hinges, which is
used only to goat, beef, and BACON, PORK, and *TURNIPS*, and onions;
and if you come to me with your court-dishes, they make my stomach
squeamish, and many times I loath 'em. Carver, let it be your care to
provide me a good olla podrida; and the more podrida it is, the better,
and more savoury; and in your ollas you may boil and ballast in what you
will, so it be victuals; and I will be mindful of you, and make you
amends one day. And let no man play the fool with me; for either we are,
or we are not. Let's be merry and wise; when the sun shines, he shines
upon all: I'll govern this island without looking my due, or taking
bribes; and therefore let all the world be watchful and look to their
bolt, for I give 'em to understand there's rods in piss for them;
and if they put me to it, they shall see wonders. Ay, ay, cover
yourselves with honey, and you shall see the flies will eat you.
