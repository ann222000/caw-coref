Mountain Meadows Massacre Statement - 1860
The Valley Tan - February 29, 1860
The Mountain Meadows Massacre.
_____

STATEMENT OF MR. WM. H. ROGERS.
To the Editor of the Valley Tan. -- I have observed on the part of one
or both of the Mormon newspapers published in this city, an evident
purpose to treat with a light and cavalier manner the statement that
has been many times made, that the Mormons were concerned in the
Mountain Meadows massacre. By their references to the matter, they
would evidently produce the impression, that the whole story in regard
to the Mormons being in any way concerned in the transaction, is one
that has been framed for the purpose of increasing the prejudice and
dislike with which they are already regarded by the great body of the
people of the country. As I have never seen a published statement of
the facts connected with that wholesale butchery, so far as the facts
in regard to it have been brought to light, I have determined to
supply this omission, by a statement of facts and circumstances in
relation to it, gathered during a trip which I made with Dr. Forney,
Superintendent of Indian affairs for Utah Territory, into the region
where the massacre occured, in the Spring of 1859.

Dr. Forney left Camp Floyd in the last of March, 1859, to go down to
the Santa Clara settlement, 350 miles south of Salt Lake City, to
obtain and bring back with him the children saved from the Mountain
Meadows massacre, who had been collected, and were then in charge of
Mr. Jacob Hamblin. Dr. Forney, having some time previously employed
him to collect the children and take care of them till he could take
them away. On this trip Dr. Forney employed me to accompany him as an
assistant, and I first joined him at the town of Nephi, 80 or 90 miles
south of Salt Lake City. From Nephi we proceeded through Filmore to
the Indian farm on Cirn Creek, 15 miles south, where we distributed
some goods to the Indians; from thence we proceded to Beaver, Parowan,
Cedar City, and Painter creek. The latter is a small place in the
immediate vicinity of the Mountain Meadows, where the celebrated
massacre occurred in September 1857. In passing through each of the
towns named, the Doctor and myself made diligent inquiry concerning
the massacre of this party of emigrants; the number of persons
composing the emigrant party, and other matters deemed of interest in
relation to them. We however, ascertained but little. The number of
emigrants was generally estimated at from 120 to 140; but no one
professed to have any knowledge if the massacre, except that they had
heard [that it] was done by the Indians. At Painter creek, an Indian
guide that had been sent to us by Jacob Hamblin, already referred to
as the man that Dr. Forney had employed to collect and take charge of
the children saved from the Mountain Meadows massacre, came with us.
This guide conducted us to the scene of the massacre.

The small valley known as the Mountain Meadows, in which it occurred
and which will hereafter impart to its appropriate and once inviting
name a sad and horrible history, is situated about 6 miles south of
Painter Creek, a small Mormon settlement in Iron county. The valley is
about 5 miles in length. and in the widest part does not exceed a mile
in breadth. It is covered mostly during the summer with rich and
luxuriant grass, and is nearly the last place where grass can be found
on the southern road to California, before striking the desert. On the
north end of the valley, near where the road enters it, a ranch has
been constructed for the purpose of herding and taking care of the
cattle brought there during the summer to graze. This ranch is owned
by Jacob Hamblin. He lives there only during the summer months and
spends the winter with his family at the Santa Clara settlement, some
distance south of the Mountain Meadows. This ranch was unoccupied at
the time that our Indian guide conducted us into the valley. The
immediate locality of the massacre of the emigrant party is about four
miles from the ranch on the road leading south. The valley at the
place slopes gently toward the south; a small ravine runs parallel
with the road on the right hand side at the spot.

When we arrived here in April, 1859, more than a year and a half after
the massacre occurred, the ground for a distance more than a hundred
yards around a central point, was covered with the skeletons and bones
of human beings, interspersed in places with rolls or bunches of
tangled or matted hair, which from its length, evidently belonged to
females. In places the bones of small children were lying side by side
with those of grown persons, as if parent and child had met death at
the same instant and with the same stroke. Small bonets and dresses,
and scraps of female apparel were also to be seen in places on the
ground there, like the bones of those who wore them, bleached from
long exposure, but their shape was, in many instances, entire. In a
gulch or hole in the ravine by the side of the road, a large number of
leg and arm bones, and also of skulls, could be seen sticking above
the surface, as if they had been buried there, but the action of the
water and digging of the wolves had again exposed them to sight. The
entire scene was one too horrible and sickening for language
adequately to describe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From this spit we proceeded south about one mile to a large spring,
">

where the emigrants were encamped when the attack was first made upon
them previous to the massacre. Here, within a few yards of the spring,
we could distinctly define the form and size of the corral which they
made, from a number of small holes, forming together a circle in the
shape of a corral. These holes were dug for the purpose of lowering
the wheels of their wagons in them, so as to form a better protection,
after the attack began. On the center of the corral a pit some twenty
feet long, and four or five wide and deep, was dug for the purpose, no
doubt, of placing the women and children in order to protect them from
the fire of the assailants. To the left of this corral, and about ine
hundred and fifty or sixty yards distant, on a small mound or knoll, a
number of stones were still piled up in a way to form a partial
breastwork or protection against the fire which the emigrants no doubt
returned for several days against their assailants. Numbers of the
stines in this breastwork had bullet marks upon them on the side
towards the corral, fully supporting the abve construction as to its
use. In places around the corral, human bones and imperfect skeletons
were lying on the ground, indicating, with the corral and the
breastwork on the knoll, that it was here, and not at the place spoken
of where the great body of bines were found, that the work of
slaughter began. From this spring we proceeded on towards the
settlement on the Santa Clara, for the purpose of obtaining the
children from Mr. Hamblin, who resides there. -- On the same evening,
after we had struck our camp for the night, a man drove up near us
with an ox wagon, going also in the direction of Santa Clara. After
turning out his oxen, he came to our tents and very soon informed us
that he lived at Santa Clara, and that he was returning home from
Cedar City with a load of flour, which he had been up to the latter
place to obtain. The conversation, after these personal explanations,
turned very naturally, after what we had witnessed during the day,
upon the Mountain Meadows massacre. And this man, whose name was Carl,
or Carlie Shirts, informed us that he lived at the time the massacre
occurred, at the ranch owned by Mr. Hamblin, at the north end of the
Mountain Meadows. He was employed by Mr. Hamblin and making adobies at
the time. He saw the emigrants when they entered the valley, and
talked with several of the men belonging to it. They appeared
perfectly civil and gentlemanly. The train, he supposed, contained
about forty wagons, and seven or eight hundred head of cattle,
including those that were loose, besides a considerable number of
horses and mules. The emigrants entered the valley on Friday, and the
men with whom he conversed told him that they were anxious to stop a
few days and rest and recruit their stock before entering on the
desert, and inquired of him a good spot for this purpose. He
recommended the vicinity of the spring in the siuth end of the
Meadows, as good water and plenty of grass abounded there. Following
this advice, they proceeded there and encamped. The next morning he
again saw some of the men, who informed him that they were looking for
lost stock. In the evening he saw the men returning, driving some
loose cattle. He never saw any of the party afterwards. Early on
Monday morning following, he stated that he heard the fire of a great
many guns in the south, in the direction of the camp of the emigrants,
he also saw on the hills around a good many Indians passing backwards
and forwards, as if in a state of commotion or excitement. His
impression from hearing the guns and seeing the Indians at the time,
was, that the latter had attacked the emigrants. On our inquiry why he
did not go to Painter Creek and give the alarm if he thought so, he
stated that he supposed the people knew about it. If not in the words,
the foregoing is the exact substance of the statement made by Shirts.

On the day following, we reached the Santa Clara settlement and found
in the possession of Mr. Hamblin, thirteen of the children preserved
from the massacre, which, with one at Painter Creek, and two at Cedar
City, was all that had then been heard of. These children were well
with the exception of sore eyes, which they all had, and which
prevailed at the time as an epidemic in the place [or] vicinity where
they were. After remaining a few days in Santa Clara in distributing
some goods to the Indians, we set out with these children on our
return. We did not take the same route by which we came down, but
proceeding from Santa Clara direct to Harmony, leaving the Mountain
Meadows some 15 or 20 miles to our left. On arriving at Harmony Dr.
Forney called on John D. Lee, who was at the time, as he may be at
present, a bishop in the Mormon church. The Doctor had received
information which led him to believe that Lee had a portion of the
property belonging to these murdered emigrants in his possession, and
his object in calling on him was to demand a surrender of the
property. On the demand being made, bishop Lee denied having
possession of any of the property, or any knowledge concerning it,
further than that, he heard that the Indians took it.

I was not present when this demand was made, but was informed of it as
recited by Dr. Forney on his return from Lee's house. Dr. Forney also
informed me that, in a conversation with Lee concerning the massacre,
he stated he was not at the massacre but reached there just after it
ended. He also stated that Isaac Haight, who presided at Cedar City,
and is another prominent dignitary in the Mormon church, holding an
office styled &quot;president,&quot; which is higher than than that of a bishop,
also arrived at the spot soon after him. In the same conversation as
related to me, Lee applied some foul and indecent epithets to the
emigrants -- said that they were slandering the Mormons, while passing
along, and in general terms justified the killing. The day after this
conversation with Lee, we started for Cedar City; Bishop Lee also set
out with us for the professed purpose of going to see Prest. Haight
and bishop Higby at Cedar City, and talking over with those men, in
the presence of Dr. Forney, the circumstances in relation to the
massacre, and the suspocions which had been expressed, that they were
concerned in it, either as actual participants in the deed itself, or
as inciting the Indians to the crime, and, then sharing with them the
spoils of the slain. Bishop Lee proceeded in company with us about
half way from Harmony to Cedar City, when, from some unknown cause, he
rode ahead and we did not see him afterwards.

On our arrival at Cedar City he was not there, or if he was, he kept
secreted and out of sight. Dr. Forney met there President Haight and
Bishop Higby, and made of these ecclesiastics the same demand that he
did of Bishop Lee, and received about the same replies, from them that
Lee gave. They did not, however, attempt to justify the massacre, on
the ground of their slandering the Mormons. On leaving Cedar City, on
our way back, before arriving at Corn Creek, the Indian chief, Kanosh,
who had been with us from the time that we left the Indian farm on
Corn Creek, going south, informed Dr. Forney, that some Indians had
told him on the way, that there were two more children saved from the
massacre than Mr. Hamblin had collected. This information, though not
deemed very reliable, the Doctor considered of sufficient importance
to make an additional effort, in order to ascertain whether it was
correct or not. On arriving at Corn Creek, we found there three
companies of U. S. troops from Camp Floyd, under the command of
Captain Campbell, who was on his way south to meet Maj. Prince,
paymaster in the army, who was returning to Camp Floyd from
Califirnia, with a large sum of money. On meeting these troops, Dr.
Forney furnished me with instructions, and directed me to return south
again with the troops, and see if I could ascertain anything about the
two children spoken of by Kanish. Judge Cradelbaugh, of the U. S.
District Court for Utah, was also traveling with Capt. Campbell's
command into the vicinity of Mountain Meadows, to see if he could
obtain any evidence against persons who had been charged with
participating in the massacre, that would justify him in arresting and
holding them for trial. He was proceeding as a court inquiry or
investigation simply; and informed me that he had authority from Gen.
Johnston to retain a portion of the troops under Capt. Campbell, if he
deemed it necessary, either to protect the court or to enforce its
writs. Judge Cradlebaugh, on setting out was accompanied by deputy
marshal, J. H. Stone, but the latter was compelled to stop near Nephi
on account of sickness. Judge Cradlebaugh now requested me to take the
place of Mr. Stone, as I had been previously sworn in and acted as
deputy U. S. Marshall at the U. S. District Court, held at Provo in
the preceding month. As the duties of this post could in no way
interfere with my search for the two children, said to have been left,
and might enable me better to find them, I acceded to Judge
Cradlebaugh's request to act as marshal.

In the vicinity of Parowan and below Cedar City, where the command of
Capt. Campbell encamped, the soldiers, while hunting for wood,
discovered human bones scattered in the bushes, and at one place they
brought an entire skeleton into camp -- the bones of which were still
united and held together by sinews, showing that the person, whoever
it was, could not have been a great while dead. We had no knowledge at
the time, and never received any, as to whose remains these were, or
whether they were persons that had died from exposure, or starvation,
or whether they were victims if treachery and murder. From the
distance at which they were found from the place of the Mountain
Meadows massacre, it is not presumable that they formed a portion of
the party slain there.

On arriving at Cedar City, President Haight and Bishop Higby were not
seen; but at the camping ground, a few miles beyond, Judge Cradlebaugh
issued writs for their arrest, and also for the arrest of Bishop Lee
if Harminy, and placed them in my hands for execution. These writs
were issued, as I understand, on the authority of affidavits, charging
these men with being concerned in the Mountain Meadows massacre, which
were made before Judge Cradlebaugh before he set out to investigate
the matter.

These writs were given to me when we were about four or five miles
below Cedar City and about twelve or fourteen from Harmony; but as
nothing had been seen of Haught or Higby in passing through Cedar
City, I thought it best to proceed first to Harmony and try to secure
Lee, and afterwards to return and try to arrest Haight and Higby, if
circumstances gave promise of any success in doing so. It is proper
for me to say here, that not only Haight and Higby, but a large
portion of the male inhabitants of the different Mormon towns, and
settlements through which we passed, either fled or secreted
themselves on the approach of the troops. The cause of this I do not
know, unless from a consciousness of guilt of some kind, as the troops
were certainly on no hostile expedition against the inhabitants, but
were simply on their way to act as an escort to a paymaster of the
army. And Judge Cradlebaugh did not seek to interfere with the right
or liberty of any man [unaccused of crime]. I summoned to attend me,
and if necessary act as a civil power, in the arrest of Lee, eight
Quartermaster's men who were traveling with Capt. Campbell's command;
on their way to California. Accompanied by these men, I started for
Harmony on the morning that I received the writs. On the way thither
we passed through or near a small settlement containing five or six
houses. I stopped here to make inquiries about the two children. The
residents of the place, men, women and children, mostly came out of
their hiuses when I had stopped, but none of them professed to know
anything about any children besides those that Mr. Hamblin had
collected. I told them that if the children were in the country at
all, every house would be searched if they were not given up. At this,
one of the men present, but who did not live in the place, but had
arrived there just before me, stated that his wife had one of the
children; that he lived at Pocketville, another small settlement forty
or fifty miles distant, named from its location in the mountains. He
stated that the child was very young, and that his wife was very much
attached to it, and that it would give me much trouble if I took it
away, and seemed by all his remarks, to be anxious to retain it. I
told him that I had no power to give the child away, and that I would
send and get it in a few days. Mr. Hamblin went over and brought this
child away in a few days after I discovered where it was. This child
was a bright eyed and rosy cheeked boy, about two years old, and must
have been an infant when the massacre occurred.

On being brought to Salt Lake City, and joining the other children,
one of the oldest boys of the group, whose name was John Calvin Sorrow
[sic - Sorel?], ran up to it, and kissing it remarked that it was his
little brother; and that he did not know where he was. From this
circumstance this child received the name of Sorrow, after that of the
older boy, but whether it was their original name or not I do not
know; it is, at all events, expressive of their sad history. The
second child said to have been left, I never heard of, although I
inquired diligently after it. On arriving at Harmony, with the men
accompanying me, I went to the house of Bishop Lee and inquired for
him, but was informed by one of his wives, (I was told that they were
thirteen in number,) that Mr. Lee had been absent two or three days in
the mountains; that he was there looking for copper with the Indians.
Others besides his family of whom I inquired, also informed me that he
had gone away. As he had thus played the same dodge that President
Haight and Bishop Higby gave us at Cedar City, I deemed it useless to
wait for his return, or to return myself to Cedar City under any
expectation of finding Haight or Higby there. I therefore returned
again to the camp of Capt. Campbell, and proceeded on with it to the
Mountain Meadows, and encamped a second time by the spring in the
south end of the meadows, where the emigrants were encamped before
being butchered

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the Mountain Meadows, Capt. Campbell, with his command, proceeded
">

to the Santa Clara, some four or five miles from the Mormon settlement
on that stream, and there awaited the arrival of Maj. Prince. We
waited here a week before Maj. Prince arrived. During our stay here
some Indians in the vicinity came frequently to our camp, the same
Indians that had been charged with [attacking] the emigrants at the
Mountain Meadows. These Indians admitted that a portion of them were
present after the attack began at the corral, but denied they joined
in it. One of these Indians stated in the presence of others of the
same band, that after the attack was made upon the emigrants at the
corral, a white man came to them and exhibited a letter, and stated
that it was from Brigham Young, and that it directed them to go up and
help whip the emigrants. A portion of the band went therefore, but did
not assist in the fight, and gave as a reason for not doing so, that
the emigrants had long guns and were good shots, and they were afraid
to venture near. A chief of the band stated that a brother of his was
killed by a shot from the corral at a distance of two hundred yards,
as he was running across the meadow. These Indians also stated that
the Mormons who killed the emigrants were painted so as to resemble
Indians. They denied that they received aby of the stock or property
belonging to the emigrants, except a few of the old clothes. These
Indians called Bishop Lee &quot;Narguts,&quot; was there but would not venture
near, being, like themselves, afraid. President Haight and Bishop
Higby were also present, aiding in the attack.

Maj. Carlton, of the first Dragoons, came as the escort of Maj. Prince
from California. On reaching Santa Clara where we were encamped, the
two commands went together to the Mountain Meadows -- Maj. Carlton, to
recruit his stock, before setting out on his return to California, and
Capt. Campbell on his way to Camp Floyd. Leaving these commands both
here, Judge Cradlebaugh and I proceeded forward to Cedar City, where
the Judge intended to remain some time and make a thorough
investigation if he could, concerning the massacre and persons engaged
in it.

Owing to some disadvantages in the location of Cedar City, a large
portion of the inhabitants that once dwelt there had moved away, and
there was, in consequence, a good many vacant houses in the place.
Judge Cradlebaugh obtained the use of one of these to stay in while he
remained, and for the purpose of a court room. As soon as it became
known that Judge C. intended holding a court, and investigating the
circumstances of the massacre, and that he would have troops to ensure
protection, and enforce his writs if necessary, several persons
visited him at his room, at late hours of the night, and informed him
of different facts connected with the massacre. All these that called
thus, stated that it would be at the risk of their lives if it became
known that they had communicated anything to him; and they requested
Judge Cradlebaugh, if he met them in public in the day time, not to
recognize them as persons that he had before seen.

One of the men who called thus on Judge Cradlebaugh, confessed that he
participated in the massacre, and gave the following account of it:
Previous to the massacre there was a council held at Cedar City, which
President Haight, and Bishops Higby and Lee attended. At this council
they designed or appointed a large number of men residing in Cedar
City, and in other settlements around, to perform the work of
dispatching these emigrants. The men appointed for this purpose, were
instructed to report, well armed, at a given time, to a spring or
small stream, lying a short distance to the left of the road leading
into the meadows, and not very far from Hamblin's ranch, but concealed
from it by intervening hills. This was the place of rendezvous; and
here the men, when they arrived, painted and otherwise disguised
themselves so as to resemble Indians. From thence they proceeded,
early on Monday morning, by a path or trail which leads from his
spring directly into the meadows, and enters the road some distance
beyond Hamblin's ranch. By taking this route they could not be seen by
any one at the ranch. On arriving at the corral of the emigrants, a
number of the men were standing on the outside by the camp-fires,
which, from appearances, they had just been building. These were first
fired upon, and at the first discharge several of them fell dead or
wounded; the remainder immediately ran to the inside of the corral,
and began fortifying themselves, and preparing for defence as well as
they could, by shoving their wagons closer together, and digging holes
into which to lower them, so as to keep the shots from going under and
striking them. The attack continued in a desultory and irregular
manner for four or five days. The corral was closely watched, and if
any of the emigrants showed themselves they were instantly fired at
from without. If they attempted to go to the spring, which was only a
few yards distant, they were sure to fall by the rifles of their
assailants. In consequence of the almost certain death that resulted
from any attempt to procure water, the emigrants, before the siege
discontinued, suffered intensely from thirst. The assailants,
believing at length that the emigrants could not be subdued by the
means adopted, resorted to treachery and strategem to accomplish what
they had been unable to do by force. They returned to the spring where
they had painted and disguised themselves pervious to commencing the
attack, and there removed those disguises, and again assumed their
ordinary dress. After this, Bishop Lee, with a party of men, returned
to the camp of the emigrants, bearing a white flag as a signal of
truce. From the position of the corral, the emigrants were able to see
them some time before they reached it. As soon as they discerned it,
they dressed a little girl in white, and placed her at the entrance of
the corral, to indicate their friendly feelings to the persons bearing
the flag. Lee and his party, on arriving, were invited into the
corral, where they staid about an hour, talking with them about the
attack that had been made upon them. Lee told the emigrants that the
Indians had gone off over the hills, and that if they would lay down
their arms and give up their property, he and his party would conduct
them back to Cedar City; but if they went out with their arms, the
Indians would look upon it as an unfriendly act, and would again
attack them. The emigrants, trusting to Lee's honor and to the
sincerity of his statements, consented to the terms which he proposed,
and left their property and all their arms at the corral, and, under
the escort of Lee and his party, started towards the north in the
direction of Cedar City. After they had proceeded about a mile on
their way, on a signal given by Bishop Higby, who was one of the party
that went to the corral with Lee, the slaughter began.

The men were mostly killed or shot down at the first fire, and the
women and children, who immediately fled in different directions, were
quickly pursued and dispatched.

Such was the substance, if not the exact words, of a statement made by
a man to Judge Cradlebaugh, in my presence, who at the same time
confessed that he participated in the horrible events which he
related. He also gave Judge C. the names of 25 or 30 other men living
in the region, who assisted in the massacre. He offered also to make
the same statement in court and under oath, if protection was
guaranteed to him. He gave as a reason for divulging these facts, that
they had tormented his mind and conscience since they occurred, and he
expressed a willingness to stand a trial for his crime.

We had been in Cedar City but two days when Capt. Campbell with his
command arrived, and informed Judge Cradlebaugh that he had received
an express from Gen. Johnston, directing him to bring back with him
all the troops in his command, as reports were then current that the
Mormons were assembling in armed bodies in the mountains, for what
purpose was not known. In consequence of this order, Judge Cradlebaugh
was left without the means of either protecting witnesses who might be
called on to testify in court, or of arresting any parties who might
flee or resist his writs. Without assistance of this kind, he deemed
it useless to attempt to hold a court, and we accordingly both left on
the following day with Capt. Campbell, on his return to Camp Floyd. On
our way there we were overtaken by Mr. and Mrs. Hamblin, on their way
to Salt Lake City. They had with them the child found at Pocketsville.
I had employed Mr. H. to take it to the city, knowing that it would be
out of my power to devote proper care to it, under the circumstances
in which I was placed. Mr. Hamblin travelled in company with us for a
day or two, and during this time Mrs. H. informed me that at the time
of the massacre, she was living at the ranch at the north end of the
Mountain Meadows, and that for several days before these children were
brought to her house, or before she had even seen them, she saw
several men loitering about in the vicinity of her house without any
apparent object or business; this was an unusual circumstance. On the
day that the massacre took place, Mrs. Hamblin stated that the
children were brought to her house, and there disposed of by Bishop
Lee to different white persons who were there at the time. Lee
professed to act as an agent for the Indians in disposing of these
children. He pretended to barter them for guns, blankets, and ponies
for the use of the Indians; but Mrs. H. stated that she was of the
opinion at the time that the children were not really sold, and that
the pretence of doing so by Lee was a mere sham. Lee went through the
form of selling or bartering off all the children but two. One if
these was an infant whose left arm was nearly shot off above the
elbow, the bone being entirely severed; the other was her sister,
three or four years older. These two, Mrs. Hamblin stated, Bishop Lee
gave to her, and asigned as a reason for doing so, the high esteem
which the Indians had for Mr. Hamblin. I have omitted heretofore to
state that Jacob Hamblin, the husband of this lady, who has been
several times referred to in this narrative, was a &quot;President&quot; in the
Mirmon church, holding the same office as that of Isaac Haight. From
many interviews that I have had with Mr. Hamblin, and from all that I
could learn from others, he was absent from home, and in Salt Lake
City; when the massacre took place; and I have no evidence ir reason
ro believe that he was in any way concerned, or even aware of the
massacre, till after it was over.

It will be remembered that I employed Mr. Hamblin to go to Pocketville
for the child which I heard of there. After his return with the child,
Mr. Hamblin came to the camp of Capt. Campbell, on the Santa Clara, to
inform me of the fact. -- While there he told me that he had heard
more, and learned more about the massacre during his absence after the
child, than he ever knew before; that he had been told of a number of
men that he knew, who were concerned [with] it, that he never dreamed
or suspected, or would have suspected of being concerned in it, but
for what he had been told. I inquired of him the names of these men,
and he informed me that he was under a promise of secrecy not to
divulge them to any one but Gov. Cumming; but that he [intended] to
tell him who they were. Mr. Hamblin was in Salt Lake City not long
after, but I was told by Gov. Cumming after he left, that he had
revealed nothing to him in regard to the massacre or those concerned
in it.

These are the principal and most important facts obtained in relation
to this noted massacre during the trip to which I have referred. I
have omitted many minor facts and circumstances corroborative of those
given, on account of the additional length to which they would extend
this article, which is already quite lengthy. I have aimed at the
narration simply of what I saw and heard, leaving the public to place
any construction they deem proper upon the facts and statements given.
And this would not have been done by me in this manner if I had seen
from any one else a publication embodying these particulars, if this
attempt had not been made to sneer away the evidence that exists of
Mormon complicity in this horrid massacre, if not of their being the
only persons concerned in it.
WM. H. ROGERS.
