The judge must be ascared that OJ will go out and kill someone if he
is released.  That motherfucking monkey needs to be kept in a cage.
If I had my way, it would be at Miami's MetroZoo where you could pay a
little extra money to see him and the money would go to Ron Goldman.

Also, you should be able to feed him peanuts.  Fucking murdering
primate...

Remember when goblin went to the Trump wedding at the Plaza.  He was
thrilled to hang out with OJ.

The scary thing is that if OJ had murdered two black people instead of a
jewish guy, he would still be welcomed with open arms by the slim liberals
on Long Island.

&gt;     &quot;Turn on Stern&quot;, by Tommy Joe.  I have never been a Stern fan,
&gt;mainly because he bores me.  But it would be funny for him to have OJ
&gt;on his show, then OJ goes berserk over something Stern says, and turns
&gt;on him with the cameras rolling, quickly grasping and snapping Stern's
&gt;scrawny neck before any of his crew can get in to save him in time.
&gt;An on-air strangling of Stern by the bare-handedly athletic OJ Simpson
&gt;- man, what a kick that would be.

I agree.  And the memorabilia folks in that hotel room should count

Thanks for your thoughts., labboy.  But I have to tell you that I'm
an OJ supporter of sorts.  I'm not saying I think he didn't kill
Nicole and Ron Goldman, only that maybe it's nobody's business other
than OJ's and the other parties involved.  It's a personal thing.
Same with this memorabilia bullshit.  I don't feel the need at this
moment to be protected from OJ Simpson.  I don't welcome the law's
offer.  Simpson didn't jump out from behind a tree and slaughter
unsuspecting passerby.  He killed people he knew.  Birds of a feather
flock together.  As you have implied at convenient moments.  Simpson
is not a threat to society.  Not mine anyway.

Two things from my perspective:

1.  He's a proven violent douchebag that has been busted for road
rage.  Who gets busted for that?  He wasn't busted for murder, and who
knows if he's gonna get busted for this?

2.  He lives in S. Florida, as do I.  I don't want to flip off some
asshole for driving a Bronco real slow in the fast lane just to find
out that I'm the next celebrity murder victim.

BTW, last night on CNN they showed him standing next to his lawyers
and they were like six inches taller than he was.  WTF, I always
thought he was a big guy, but maybe he's shrinking into a little man.

My hope is to see him walking around like Fred Sanford on the porch of
his house in the ghetto yelling at passing cars...

Not entirely, KK.  Yeah, I know it's murder, but the fact remains
he knew both parties and we don't know exactly what went down.  As far
as I'm concerned the law is an intrusion.  If there was no law, Fred
Goldman could have had OJ offed all by himself.  If there was no law,
maybe people would actually in time treat each other with more
respect.  As long as the law is around there will continue to be more
and more crime building up beneath the rug which is growing thinner by
the day.  I realize my comments may sound unserious or forced, maybe
for laughs - and maybe in a way they are - but I am also serious when
I say that I have no sympathy whatever for Nicole Smith, although
possibly a little for Goldman's son, who could have been an innocent
victim.  But even then I still think they were all coke abusers and
essentially really messed up people who sort of derserved each other,
and I really don't care what happened and do not view OJ as a threat
and would not consider him as such if I saw him coming down the
street.  But I do cringe when I see the law, even though I have done
nothing wrong.  Some guys only have one killing in them.  I believe
Simpson has shot his wad.  Let him go.  And I'm really sick of this
unAmerican bullshit of saying Simpson can't make money selling words
he himself has written.  That is a really sick law, on top of most
laws, which ultimately are all sick.

&gt; &gt; Are you fucking kidding me?

&gt;     Not entirely, KK.  Yeah, I know it's murder, but the fact remains
&gt; he knew both parties and we don't know exactly what went down.  As far
&gt; as I'm concerned the law is an intrusion.  If there was no law, Fred
&gt; Goldman could have had OJ offed all by himself.  If there was no law,
&gt; maybe people would actually in time treat each other with more
&gt; respect.  As long as the law is around there will continue to be more
&gt; and more crime building up beneath the rug which is growing thinner by
&gt; the day.  I realize my comments may sound unserious or forced, maybe
&gt; for laughs - and maybe in a way they are - but I am also serious when
&gt; I say that I have no sympathy whatever for Nicole Smith, although
&gt; possibly a little for Goldman's son, who could have been an innocent
&gt; victim.  But even then I still think they were all coke abusers and
&gt; essentially really messed up people who sort of derserved each other,
&gt; and I really don't care what happened and do not view OJ as a threat
&gt; and would not consider him as such if I saw him coming down the
&gt; street.  But I do cringe when I see the law, even though I have done
&gt; nothing wrong.  Some guys only have one killing in them.  I believe
&gt; Simpson has shot his wad.  Let him go.  And I'm really sick of this
&gt; unAmerican bullshit of saying Simpson can't make money selling words
&gt; he himself has written.  That is a really sick law, on top of most
&gt; laws, which ultimately are all sick.

Go read up on OJ in his early years.   How he grew up in the projects
and was extremely proficient in the use of a knife to become king
of the hill.   When you read about his early years it foretells alot
of the events leading up to Ron and Nicole.

Add to that the incredible strength he developed after years in
the NFL and plying college football.

In all fairness you could say that about most books written by
famous people, even highly educated people who know how to sling words
together.  So Simpson used a ghost writer, so what?  Without OJ
there's no book to begin with.  But what really ticked me off is when
I read in the paper that Fred Goldman acquired the rights to Simpson's
book and is now selling it after changing the title.  Simpson was
acquitted, right or wrong.  He writes a book and some guy as the right
to take it away, change the title and sell it?  That's not right.
Anyway, even if Simpson's book is full of lies, I still like the idea
of an accused/released murderer writing a book saying he didn't do the
murders, BUT, if he did, THIS is how he would do them - then goes on
to graphically describe how he would have done it.  He can also
ridicule the methods used by the uncaught killers by saying something
like, &quot;I never would have done that, much too messy.&quot;  The concept of
an exonerrated murder suspect writing a book detailing how he would
have done it is pretty funny to me.  Simpson probably had that idea
suggested to him by a lawyer or professional writer.  But once again,
without OJ it's not going to happen.  So even if he isn't the guy who
actually writes the book, to me he is still the writer.

The viktims family are the real killers.  Money grubbing whores and
pimps.  Apparently OJ has figured out ways to hide money from these
leeches.  I am sure Nicoles family was on a gravy train when she was
alive and they sure hated to see it end.  Maybe they killed her and
tried to set OJ up?

&gt; They were sleaze.  Ron was driving around Brentwood in OJ's Ferrari,

&gt; two were asking for it.  I don't approve of murder but some people

hah hah hah, certainly not impossible.  I think OJ killed Nicole
and Ron.  Oh how sweet, &quot;Nicole and Ron!&quot;  Simpson's got a new
girlfriend, kind of a clone of the one who was killed.  I saw her for
a flash on the tv being interviewed and she sounded really blasted out
on something, maybe a combination of coke and heroin.

Anyway, while I do think Simpson killed those two, I agree with
you that Goldman's family is pure scum.  Although in this society I
suppose I can't blame anybody for taking a shot at their 15 seconds of
fame when it comes along.

Other than that, have you ever wondered what it might be like to
actually be innocent of something while everyone thinks you're
guilty?  Imagine if Simpson didn't do it, and everywhere he goes he's
viewed as a killer.  Even when people visit the football hall of fame
in Canton Ohio and see OJs bust among the other football greats, at
that moment all they can think is, &quot;Oh yeah, Simpson, he's the guy who
killed those two people, isn't he?&quot;

Lastly, those scum Simpson and his &quot;posse&quot; went after in that
hotel room deserved all they got and maybe more.  They too are a bunch
of vultures.  At least when Simpson thinks it's time to act, he takes
matter into his own hands.  Get it?  &quot;Into his own hands?&quot;  hah hah
hah hah hah

Yeah, 'nuff said alright.  I'm sick of the subject and have been
for some time.  Jumping back into it is slightly embarrassing, like
watching the pro and anti OJ crowd yelling at each other outside the
courtroom when the 60 year old ex footballer emerged after posting
bond.  It reminds of those morons who gather at the Oscars each year
carrying placards emblazoned with the names of their favorite movie
stars, and when the stars make their entrance the camera pans in on
the pimply-faced celebrity-worshipping geeks enjoying the highlight of
their life.  It's sort of the same with the pro and anti OJ people.
I'm just putting a few thoughts down on the matter, not dedicating my
life to it one way or the other.  I don't care if OJ dies tomorrow,
just like I don't care that Nicole and Ron are dead.  That goes for
you too.  Nuff said?
