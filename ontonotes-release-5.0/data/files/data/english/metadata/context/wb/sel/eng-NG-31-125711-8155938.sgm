Fantastic idea, in fact SAS do the same at GLA and EDI I believe, here's
some stats from Autoroute -

LHR-LGW = 42.7 miles - 38 minutes

EDI-GLA = 48.5 miles - 45 minutes

I planned a direct bus service which got no enthusiasm in aaue. An &quot;Airlink&quot;
style service with luggage bays in addition to the current inter-city
services that would link both big cities and airports routing
GLA-Glasgow-EDI-Edinburgh and vv using the very handy M8. Hardly anyone
would have the need to get from EDI to GLA and vv but people would join and
alight at all points making it a worthwhile addition to the transport
network, particularly for our airports. Anything wrong with that idea?

The m8 Slog as you call it is a lot worse going from east to west,
once you get near the city centre its a case of having to continually
move over to the right hand lane or else you find yourself on an exit
road into glasgow city centre, and nobody is asking people from
Glasgow to bank roll EDI, all i said was that if there was a  free
airport tranfer service, from the glasgow road, i think it would get
used, either that or a taxi rank.. why do you continually think that
i'm getting at GLA. this is an EDI forum or had you forgot that, For
what it's worth i would suggest the same idea be put in place at GLA,
its a bit of a long walk from the respective motorway slip roads at
EDI and GLA for people to be excpected to walk to the terminal.

can i just say you are showing the very behaviour towards  EDI that
you accuse Joe of showing towards GLA, from where i see it Joe puts up
a post of fact, Where he gets these facts from i dont now, but they
all seem geniuine, If people who support GLA or dont want to see EDI
thrive dont like seeing these facts may i suggest they leave this
forum, if however you have a legitimate debate about these facts,
BRILLIANT, but please dont descend into gutter remarks, because you'l
never win and Joe will just find more and more facts to hurt you with.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; LHR-LGW = 42.7 miles - 38 minutes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With direct public transport options.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; EDI-GLA = 48.5 miles - 45 minutes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With no direct public transport options and none planned.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I planned a direct bus service which got no enthusiasm in aaue. An &quot;Airlink&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; style service with luggage bays in addition to the current inter-city
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; services that would link both big cities and airports routing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GLA-Glasgow-EDI-Edinburgh and vv using the very handy M8. Hardly anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have the need to get from EDI to GLA and vv but people would join and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alight at all points making it a worthwhile addition to the transport
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; network, particularly for our airports. Anything wrong with that idea?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I very good Idea, i've always thought that the fact that buses from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glasgow, Livingston, Stirling, in other words most places west and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; north of edinburgh mostly go along the glasgow road, That BAA could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run a shuttle service from a bus stop on the glasgow road, at the stop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for ingliston, to the airport. anything wrong with that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why would anyone from Glasgow want to bankroll EDI when they have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own airport to patronise and not that of a city on the wrong
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side of the country,and let's not forget the M8 slog?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The m8 Slog as you call it is a lot worse going from east to west,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once you get near the city centre its a case of having to continually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move over to the right hand lane or else you find yourself on an exit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; road into glasgow city centre, and nobody is asking people from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glasgow to bank roll EDI, all i said was that if there was a  free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airport tranfer service, from the glasgow road, i think it would get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used, either that or a taxi rank.. why do you continually think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i'm getting at GLA. this is an EDI forum or had you forgot that, For
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what it's worth i would suggest the same idea be put in place at GLA,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its a bit of a long walk from the respective motorway slip roads at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EDI and GLA for people to be excpected to walk to the terminal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, but why should west coasters bankroll EDI and the Edinburgh
&gt; &gt; &gt; economy?

Well you asked for an answer, well here it is, They should bank roll
EDI because when the site of GLA airport is filled with lots of new
houses after its speedy decline in few years time, the westcoasters
will be so relieved that they used there well earned money in such a
worthy cause as scotlands world class international airport situated
in .. Wait fot it........ EDINBURGH. Good answer, dont you think?

It would help...  At least one service 900 per hour should call into

&gt; the airport.
">

Yes, and be extended on to GLA at the other end so people setting out from
Edinburgh don't have to change busses at Buchanan Street with luggage, etc.

That sounds similar to my plan except that I propose additional services
(probably 2 per hour) with busses designed for airport runs with big doors
and luggage bays. The existing Citylink 900 service is time conscious for
the thousands of daily commuters so I guess that is why it doesn't currently
call in at EDI. I can't think of any other reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact I have always advocated a bus station within the airport
&gt; grounds

Actually there is a bus station by any other name. We just need extra busses
to call in from far and wide. I certainly wouldn't be against that if the
bus operators were up for it.

The West Coasters should follow your example and only fly from their
local airport and support their own local economy and not that of a
city on the opposite side of the country, I'm sure you'll agree seeing
it's a stance you abide by yourself, so stop posting pish, as it only

Bloody brilliant, you've no idea how long i've been looking for a
horticultural forum, what about the thorns on a rose, do you get a
prick from those too? maybe you could compile a list for me with all
the plants that can give you pricks, I'm still reeling in amazement at
the imaganitive name you've gave yourself, is there no end to your
abilities. seems not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The m8 Slog as you call it is a lot worse going from east to west,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; road into glasgow city centre, and nobody is asking people from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glasgow to bank roll EDI, all i said was that if there was a  free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airport tranfer service, from the glasgow road, i think it would get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used, either that or a taxi rank.. why do you continually think that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what it's worth i would suggest the same idea be put in place at GLA,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its a bit of a long walk from the respective motorway slip roads at

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The m8 Slog as you call it is a lot worse going from east to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; west, once you get near the city centre its a case of having to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; continually move over to the right hand lane or else you find
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yourself on an exit road into glasgow city centre, and nobody is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; asking people from Glasgow to bank roll EDI, all i said was that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if there was a  free airport tranfer service, from the glasgow
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; road, i think it would get used, either that or a taxi rank..
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; why do you continually think that i'm getting at GLA. this is an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; EDI forum or had you forgot that, For what it's worth i would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; suggest the same idea be put in place at GLA, its a bit of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; long walk from the respective motorway slip roads at EDI and GLA
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for people to be excpected to walk to the terminal.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Indeed, but why should west coasters bankroll EDI and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Edinburgh economy?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I planned a direct bus service which got no enthusiasm in

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardly anyone would have the need to get from EDI to GLA

you really need to take some time out from posting messages, and get a
grip of yourself, you're trying to make it look as if people are
taking sides with one another, nobody has fan's on this forum, If
someone writes something of worth is it not allowed to be appreciated?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything wrong with that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would anyone from Glasgow want to bankroll EDI when they have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their own airport to patronise and not that of a city on the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; LHR-LGW = 42.7 miles - 38 minutes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; EDI-GLA = 48.5 miles - 45 minutes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With no direct public transport options and none planned.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I planned a direct bus service which got no enthusiasm in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aaue. An &quot;Airlink&quot; style service with luggage bays in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addition to the current inter-city services that would link
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both big cities and airports routing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GLA-Glasgow-EDI-Edinburgh and vv using the very handy M8.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardly anyone would have the need to get from EDI to GLA and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vv but people would join and alight at all points making it a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for our airports. Anything wrong with that idea?
