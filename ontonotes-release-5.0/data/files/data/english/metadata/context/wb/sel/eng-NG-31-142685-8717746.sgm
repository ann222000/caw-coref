Illegal Immigration

I'm so sick of the over generalization that liberals are pro-illegal.

I'm pro legal immigration. The way my Slovakian great-grandparents did it.
Through the name shortening process at Ellis Island.

Listen to Big Ed on Air America.

Plenty of liberal American workers like me are very upset at the effects of
illegal immigration. Besides the costs, there is the downward pressure on
wages, and the fact that big companies that hire these illegals do so without
legal ramifications. It allows them to lower wages, bust unions, and reap
bigger profits for fat-cat CEOs.

And in case you weren't paying attention, that's Bush's base.

So all you people who have voted Republican for whatever reason, maybe you
thought you'd get rich someday and you want those big tax cuts if you do, or
maybe you believed the FAUX news morphing of Ossama Bin Forgotten into Saddam
Hussein (who 85% of troops in Iraq still think attacked us on 9-11), but you
better stop voting against your interests. The Republican party has been taken
over by idiots who believe anything Sean Hannity says, Christian Zionist
zealots who want to bring on the Rapture, and Big Business sleaze bags like
the CEO of Exxon Mobile, who's retirement package is going to pay him $150,000
per DAY.

There are plenty of fiscal conservative Democrats who will not raise taxes on
the middle class, who will fight not just to keep unions, but to empower them,
and who will ENFORCE the laws we already have to stop corporations from hiring
illegals. Unless you do that, you will never stop them from coming. Who can
blame them. The ruling class and the Catholic church (c'mon, telling one of
the poorest, overpopulated countries not to use birth control, what does that
do for immigration numbers?) do nothing for them in Mexico. US agribusiness
has ruined the small rural farmer in Mexico, as they have here. We need a
comprehensive plan that includes refusal to extend trade agreements like NAFTA
unless Mexico does something to stop the waves of people coming here,
especially the criminals and gangs.

From a what-can-I-do perspective, purchase fair trade products from Mexico,
like the shade-grown organic coffee that we buy at Trader Joe's. This kind of
voting with your dollars creates sustainable jobs in Mexico, resulting in less
illegal immigration.

I get your point, but I'm angry at all these posts claiming that &quot;lib'ruuls&quot;
are for illegals. America has been sold out by both so-called liberals and
conservatives. McCain, Bush, etc,-no comment needed. Both parties get too much
money from big business to be honest.

yes I think we should get past republican and democrat.
I know liberals get blamed for liking illegals. I am a former liberal
myself.
its much more complicated  of course. I am trying to get away from
all political labels. I now call people pro-illegal or pro-
enforcement.
this makes more sense.

It's very nice to see a liberal with views like yours on illegal
immigration and related issues. But read the posts in this ng and and
on blogs and websites. The great majority, well over 95% I'd say, of
the people who oppose us are self-describd liberals. Though most are
not really &quot;liberal&quot; and could not even describe what the word
actually means. It's an unpleasant reality but  it is a fact.

Most Republicans voters are really just the same cut of people Adelie
Stevenson was appealing to. When Democrats became a Race Party
oriented against white males, those white males all ran over to the
Party of Reagan and brought their wives.

Stevenson was sharp. When he was running for President, a woman called out to
him, &quot;You have the vote of every thinking person!&quot; Stevenson called back,
&quot;That's not enough, madam, we need a majority!&quot;
