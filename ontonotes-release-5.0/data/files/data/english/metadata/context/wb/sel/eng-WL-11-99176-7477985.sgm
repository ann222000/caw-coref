George Bush spoke again (sigh!) yesterday, repeating his recent (and frequent) lie about Iraq (known by its first name, "Saddam") having refused to "disclose" and "disarm" (although he temporarily dropped the one about "denying" the inspectors). But he added another one, one of the traditional American big lies: "He also was firing on our aircraft. They were enforcing a no-fly zone, United Nations no-fly zone, the world had spoken, and he had taken shots at British and U.S. pilots."

Now I know, and you probably know, that the "no-fly zones" were imposed by the United States (and its junior flunkies across the "pond"), not by the United Nations. U.N. Resolution 688 , passed in 1991, condemns Iraqi repression of the Kurds (and unnamed others) and demands that it end. But not only is there no language in the resolution authorizing any military action against Iraq whatsoever, including no-fly zones, this statement appears as one of the "whereas" clauses:

"Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and of all States in the region,"

It certainly sounds to me like the no-fly zones were not only not authorized by Resolution 688, but they were in violation of it.

And, lest we forget, these unauthorized activities were not benign. While British and U.S. aircraft were allegedly shot at (no proof has ever been offered as far as I know; certainly none were ever hit), an estimated 300 Iraqis at a minimum, 200 of them "innocent civilians" (and the others equally innocent members of the Iraqi military) were killed by U.S. and U.K. bombs and missiles during that period. One of them was Omran Harbi Jawair:

Omran Harbi Jawair, 13, was squatting on his haunches at the time, watching the family sheep as they nosed the hard, flat ground in search of grass. He wore a white robe but was bareheaded in spite of an unforgiving sun. Omran, who liked to kick a soccer ball around this dusty village, had just finished fifth grade at the little school a 15-minute walk from his mud-brick home. A shepherd boy's summer vacation lay ahead.

That is when the missile landed.

Without warning, according to several youths standing nearby, the device came crashing down in an open field 200 yards from the dozen houses of Toq al-Ghazalat. A deafening explosion cracked across the silent land. Shrapnel flew in every direction. Four shepherds were wounded. And Omran, the others recalled, lay dead in the dirt, most of his head torn off, the white of his robe stained red.

The date? June 16, 2000. President at the time? Bill Clinton.

And, just as with the lies the other day , a check of the media reveals no evidence that any of them mentioned the latest Bush lie. Not one.

Dear Eli, one can hardly do less, than admire your energy and determination.
This article is another excellent example. The 'Liar in Chief' emanates a few of his favorite lies, (with slight variation) and you jump-in with all the intellectual honesty and dilligence, one can ever hope to muster. You of course, successfully refute him, by exhaustively providing evidence and spades of generally accepted reasoning and logic.

Here comes my bone of contention though; I'm worried, that you will wear yourself down by this neo-con 'leadership'.

You see, once politicians lied more or less, out of necessity, as a somewhat unsavory sideeffect to their job. Not anymore. This Straussian regime lies, out of duty, every time they can. If they can choose between truth and lies, they will consciously choose lies. If truth is ever sees the light of day, under their stewardship, rest is assured, it is because somebody somewhere made a serious and punishable mistake.

hi, tom:

i just want to suggest that "neo-con" is not the best description of the outlook of the current us government.

i call them either neo-liberal or reactionary for the simple reason that they want "the market" to prevail in the lives of people throughout the earth with no help from government.

in other words, a return to the law of the jungle of 19th C. capitalism in which it was each man for himself, a war of all against all.

of course, among others, the big lie is that when it comes to expanding the market (for the simple reason that capitalism must expand or die) to every nook and cranny on earth, they rely on the big guns of the us military and its henchmen. the bombing of yugoslavia in 1999 is a very good example.

if it was just the market, the people, even unarmed, would make mincemeat of the investor class, which of course they deserve.

in fact most american "true" conservatives have serious reservations about the bush regime, a point i think you made in a post on another topic.

confucius say: we must start with the naming of names.

Steve, thanks for your intelligently written comment. We both agree, that the driving ideology of this new radical right-wing regime, (and generally the ruling ideology of this era)needs another term, to differentiate from previous ones, when the governments had still sought out, some sort of consensus (however feeble) with the population. Of course, it is a matter of debate, when this radicalisation started, but the existence of the trend is not much.

What I've found, particularly frightening, is the extraordinary concentration of capital, by a small number of transnational corporations, in some cases their accumulated wealth, rivaling middle sized developed countries, and the connection this economic development has, to the right wing shift, which we experiencing in Western societies. None of our old descriptions and definitions about classic capitalism seem to work anymore, now that our societies gradually mutate from (limited) Democracy into autocratic Plutocracies.
I know, Marx has predicted long time ago, this phenomenon, (both the globalisation and the monopol capitalisation of the capitalist economies), but still, one is awed by the rapid progress of it, as it realises in front of one's eye.
I think 'reactionary' , sounds too general for describing this qualitatively new phenomenon, but 'neo-liberal' certainly sounds right.

I used the term 'neo-con' to stress our opponents' affiliation to Strauss, which has something to do, with their advanced level of lying to a degree of Orwellian proportion.
Strauss, has famously prescribed the extraordinary need, -or rather, an obligation- for the political class, to deceive the masses, as a matter of duty, in order to maintain the illusion of Democracy, while the final transformation into Plutocracy takes place.
