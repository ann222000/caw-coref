Check out the LimoLiner.

http://www.limoliner.com

They have fewer trips per day, but plenty of storage and no surcharge
for bikes (last time I checked).
As someone that is not vertically challenged, I like the legroom on
either Amtrak or Limo Liner.

Ever try taking a bike on the NJTransit NE Corridor on a Friday after
off-peak have started? Plan on using a long time window, as conductors
will say &quot;wait for the next train&quot; if its the least bit crowded.
You're far better off to pick an end of the train (rear) further from
conductors so that you can already board before they start in on you.

Note: this is not LIVEDRUNK approved, as no alcohol is permitted
onboard the Limo Liner.

Amtrak ,, and bicycles.

This is a subject that has been written about on and off for years.

First;  Amtrak sucks.  It is a government creation run by hacks, for hacks,
with no regard to the masses.

The short distance trains are really just commuter rail.  The long distance
trains are &quot;tourist&quot; trips.

It is one more reason to drive yourself nuts.  The USA,, one totally F'kd up
country.

A passenger train system that doesn't carry bicycles that aren't in boxes?
Duh?

In many cities the public buses have bicycle hangers on the front of the
bus.  You put your bicycle on the rack, load on the bus and go.

Yet;  Amtrak .. a rail line which is paid for by the US taxpayers can't
figure out how to carry a freaking bicycle?

The USA sucks.. sorry about my feelings and I do live here but it still
sucks.

There are several options for carrying a bike onto Amtrak. However, just
like some European countries, France in particular, not every train, such
as some express/local trains and TGV (bike has to be packed in a housse)
will carry bikes as a RORO or in a box. At least if you use the Amtrak
baggage car, you can get your bike when you arrive rather than days later
as in France.

Amtrak must be schizophrenic because I've taken my bike on one twice

So, if those fools decide to head somewhere for the weekend, they
can't hop a train instead of jumping in their car?  Two of the best
long distance rides I have done on the road bike this tear were to a
destination and then return on the train.  Excuses are like assholes,
everyone has one and the midwest houses some rather large ones.

That's a load of crap. In the first place, contrary to widespread
ignorant belief, _generally_ speaking it is the coasts' federal tax
dollars that subsidize the middle. Second, &quot;Penn&quot; benefits from trains
a lot. It is in the NW Corridor.Third, the NW corridor from DC to
Boston is the closest thing there is in the US to self funding
passenger rail (outside of maybe the autotrain from VA to FL).
Finally, most US citizens do not want their train service eliminated
(although you could probably talk them into eliminating someone
else's), and I'm guessing that probably includes even Iowa, whose
train service is more costly to subsidize than the NW Corridor.

&gt;&gt; In those fools defense, they get stuck with some pretty lousy schedules

&gt; So, if those fools decide to head somewhere for the weekend, they
&gt; can't hop a train instead of jumping in their car?  Two of the best
&gt; long distance rides I have done on the road bike this tear were to a
&gt; destination and then return on the train.  Excuses are like assholes,
&gt; everyone has one and the midwest houses some rather large ones.
">

Let me give you a dose of reality.

The closest train service to me is in Little Rock, Arkansas. They have one
departure scheduled (emphasis on scheduled, not reality) at 11:34 PM going
north to St Louis &amp; Chicago and a departure south to Dallas &amp; San Antonio
scheduled at 3:10 AM. That is the only passenger service going through the
state. According to the schedule it is a daily service, but when I took it
to Chicago earlier this summer, it was only 3x/week. Due to the ownership of
the rails by the freight companies, Amtrak trains are very rarely on time,
frequently 2-4 hours late. As a means of business travel in this part of the
country this is essentially impractical, leaving ridership to passengers
with more flexible schedules.

I have to drive 150 miles just to get to the Little Rock station. Tulsa, OK
is somewhat closer, but offers only bus service, no train service. I could
ride my bike to the station, but under the time limitations for the trip my
11 year old daughter obviously could not (actually, under the time
limitations of leaving work at 5 and being at the train station by 11, I
couldn't have made it either).

As I said, I rode the train this summer (also commuter rail around the
Boston area) and won't hesitate to use it again, but to do so requires much
more planning than jumping in the car.

Look at Amtrak's route atlas
http://tickets.amtrak.com/secure/content/atlas/index.html . Laughingly
threadbare, especially if you omit the green bus service lines. If you live
in the upper plains states, what are you supposedto do? Move just to ride
the train? If you have the power to increase the passenger train line
network and frequency, I'll take a train trip out to the west coast to shake
your hand. In the meantime, don't be an ass and castigate people who live in
less dense areas for their lack of ridership.

My point:  there is no train in most of the USA.

Amtrak is a government creation, therefore it does not care to make money.

If trains could be used more like buses [ obviously because of tracks etc,
not quite the same ] then more people would
take the train.

When I was a kid, there was train service from the city I grew up in to
Boston.  In the late 60's, early 70's, the train stopped running.

There isn't even commuter rail now.

Amtrak is very expensive...  the average person isn't going to pay the same
or more for a train ticket than an airplane ticket.

I just took a look at Amtrak's rail map.  There isn't even a train from
Boston to Montreal.

What this means for the average American is this;  no train.

If the service can't be available to more, then it should be abandoned.  The
long distance trains are nothing but tourist trains, and very expensive.

Just for fun, I did an Amtrak schedule/fare search;   Boston to Chicago.

The fare?  $80 dollars one way.
The time to get there?  18 hours!

First the train goes to Washington, DC.. then on the Chicago.

And you wonder why people aren't riding the train?

OKkk,,, if it is so great, and all..

Why doesn't the train service become a private business just like Southwest
Airlines,etc.

The only one full of crap is you.

Any half wit can see that Amtrak is a government waste of mony.

Does the government run the bus lines?  Such as Greyhound?

Taxi service?

Whenever the government is involved we can be sure it will be a big waste of
money.

I'd like to see the Walmart Express.

&gt; That's a load of crap. In the first place, contrary to widespread

&gt; Boston is the closest thing there is in the US to self funding
&gt; passenger rail (outside of maybe the autotrain from VA to FL).
&gt; Finally, most US citizens do not want their train service eliminated
&gt; (although you could probably talk them into eliminating someone
&gt; else's), and I'm guessing that probably includes even Iowa, whose
&gt; train service is more costly to subsidize than the NW Corridor.

==========================================================

The above is by far one of the most stupid paragraphs I have ever read on
the net.

Unfortunatley for your feeble mind, it was not the Republicans who brought
us Amtrak.  Amtrak was created when the Dems were in control of both sides
of Congress.

What Amtrak does, is take money from people in middle America and subsidize
a very inefficient government run rail service.

Why should someone in Iowa pay money in taxes so a rich dick from NY City
can take Acella to Boston?

How is that far.

I notice you are a Canadian.  VIA Rail.  I've been on that system.  The
employees were beyond stupid.  They had no idea of customer service, in fact
they kept telling folks that their union would keep them working so it was
go screw to the customers.

One moron kept refering to an Asian woman as a &quot;Gook&quot; when speaking to his
partner on the train.  Like she couldn't hear what he said.

Let Walmart take over the rail service.  The price will come down, more
passengers than ever.  It won't be fancy, but it will be cheap.

I agree.  Try taking the train in Germany.  Totally different
experience--they are on time and they actually travel at a reasonable
pace.  Bicycles are almost always loaded without any need for
packaging or disassembly, although for longer trips you have to buy a
special ticket.  If it is a short haul, you just carry it into one of
the luggage compartments yourself.  If it is a long distance train,
you bring it to the baggage car and one of the porters will lift it in
for you.

&gt; &gt; They have fewer trips per day, but plenty of storage and no surcharge

&gt; &gt; Ever try taking a bike on the NJTransit NE Corridor on a Friday after

&gt; &gt; You're far better off to pick an end of the train (rear) further from

&quot;Unfortunatley for your feeble mind, it was not the Republicans who brought
us Amtrak.  Amtrak was created when the Dems were in control of both sides
of Congress.&quot;

I realize you are beyond stupid but only the Legislature in the USA can
approve the spending of money.

A president can ask for the $$, but if the legislature says NO.. then no is
no.

Congress,, that who is approving the spending, and the continuing spending
of more and more $$$$$$$$$$$$$$

ON AMTRAK.

Amtrak still sucks.  Even Canada's Via Rail is better (although not by
much)  I once took a train from Harper's ferry to Washington DC that
was over six hours late.  I used to ride the commuter train along that
same line:  it would sway over a foot, even at low speeds.  Sure
enough, while I was living in DC an Amtrak train derailled on that
exact same stretch of track.   I lived on the West Coast for a while.
For some reason I thought the trains might be better out there.  Nope,
same old story: slow and unreliable.

Aren't most (if not all) large-scale passenger rail services subsidized?
Perhaps less subsidy (as a percentage of ticket price) than Amtrak, but
nevertheless subsidized. Even before Amtrak it can be argued that passenger
service was subsidized, since the rail lines claimed to have been losing
large amounts of money on it, yet were forced to continue service.

Don't get me wrong; subsidies for transit often make a lot of sense. And
it's not as if the airlines and auto industry aren't heavily subsidized
themselves! If someone believes that gas taxes and airport fees cover all
the expenses, they're quite mistaken.

[In the end, the major difference between Amtrak and the French rail system
is that, assuming they're not on strike, the French rail system is more
reliable, in terms of sticking to its timetable, than anything I've come
across. You can set your watch by their trains. You can depend upon making
your connections. Amtrak?]

Dear JD,

It looks like $25 to get from Santa Barbara mile 119 to Anaheim mile
253 by Amtrak:

http://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/amtrak/FareFinder?_tripType=OneWay&amp;_ori...

http://www.amtrak.com/timetable/apr07/W31.pdf

At around four hours, it sounds like an average train speed of around
35 mph, so take a good book or two.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

again for the same reason that you'll never see Ford resurrect the Model T
for production.

The company I work does business with several railways, US and overseas.
I don't know of one that isn't government run. China rail is one of our
bigger rail customers.

As long as it doesn't qualify me as a &quot;midwestern windbag&quot;, I was going to
wish JD an enjoyable ride. It's been awhile, but I can't imagine the section
from Hermosa Beach (or even Santa Monica) to Anaheim would be particularly
inspiring.

Some of us enjoy urban grit as long as the ratio of dumbass drivers is
low.

&gt; &gt; I'm sure cross-country rail could work; it works nicely in most of the

&gt; Aren't most (if not all) large-scale passenger rail services subsidized?
&gt; Perhaps less subsidy (as a percentage of ticket price) than Amtrak, but

What you say is correct, and it's true that all major modes of
transportation other than foot take advantage of some amount of public
subsidy.

My problem with Amtrak is not that it's subsidized, but rather that
despite being subsidized it still doesn't work.  There are lots of
crappy and suboptimal things about long distance highway and air
travel, no doubt.  But those modes are much better than Amtrak at
getting you where you need to go in a reasonable amount of time, for a
reasonable price, and with a reasonable frequency of service.
