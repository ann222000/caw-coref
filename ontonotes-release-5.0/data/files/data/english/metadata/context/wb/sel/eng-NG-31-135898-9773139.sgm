Hi everyone, the unofficial patch 4.5 is out and available as usual as an
exclusive for the first few days from The Patches Scrolls ((The Patches
Scrolls) Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines Downloads)! This time I also
did a simple installer version, but the patch is still downloadable as a
ZIP archive. Any feedback here or via email will be answered ;).

As for the patch itself, it finally fixes the well known
lights-off-after-reloading bug, thanks to the DllFix tool by Wabbite, and
the very old same-item-not-showing-up-in-inventory-and-container bug,
thanks to RobinHood70. I myself restored the missing sounds during the
Giovanni-truck-loading cutscene and added some others to several more
completely silent cutscenes. I also restored three cage dancers and Venus'
laptop into club Confession, feedback about how they fit in is
appreciated! The complete changelog is below, changes for plus only are
marked with a +:

v4.5 10.01.2008
----
Lowered Dane computer difficulty and fixed more sounds and objects.
+Repaired Blood Buff not adding up and blocked Ash sewers map hole.
Restored three cage dancers and Venus' laptop into club Confession.
Added Lotus key board inspection and fixed trailer key inspection.
+Swapped two of Gary's quest emails and restored a silent Tung line.
Restored Giovanni cutscene sound and created an installer version.
Improved first Heather scene and updated MP clans and descriptions.
Added sounds to Muddy, Ash, Pisha, ghouling and jumping cutscenes.
Merged light-gone-after-loading fix with MemFix, thanks to Wabbite.

Made Vandal acknowledge payment and repaired wrong nosave messages.
Repaired text of Isaac, Trip, Gargoyle, Cal, Mercurio and Therese.
Fixed Mitnick appearing after quest and more invisible python bugs.
Made new Danielle lines rotate and more speeches stay in dialogue.
Removed morphine from CS and register sounds playing without Doris.
Fixed missing detail on Chinatown sewer map and minor text issues.
Adjusted Presence chance and description and anti-cheat conditions.
Lowered money from Julius to $100 and made leaving Pisha clean up.
Fixed the known inventory-and-container-bug, thanks to RobinHood70.

The Patches Scrolls had about 12.000 hits on their download page of the
unofficial patch 4.4, so there still is some demand :)!

Actually I just bought the game through Steam a couple of weeks ago when
they had all their games on sale. I've been interested in this game since it
came out, and I've also followed all the patches that have been made for
this game. I picked it up for $10 along with the two Shadowgrounds games
which I paid $12 as a package.
I figured for $10 what the heck. I think it's great that after this long a
time someone cares enough about the game to keep working to make it better.
I've played it a little and so far it seems like an interesting game. As for
the Shadowgrounds games, I've always been a sucker for top down shooters,
and these games look pretty cool.

Yeah, they use the period to separate the thousands and millions for
numerals in Werner's part of the world. You ordinarily see that option in
localization UI, like the Windows region and time zone settings. Not sure
if their billion and trillion is the same as the American one though, as
that might just be a UK thing.

-KKC, who wonders how you would measure a fraction of a web hit.

Bear in mind Steam is a delivery service.  Your games work through it
and won't work without it.  Like Windows Live but better.  Folk seem to
love it or hate it.  I'm in the 'love it' camp

Have a look.  Some games are at a great price but others can be had
cheaper retail.  Lots of developers selling through it though so plenty
of choice

Can one not just archive most installed/unencrypted games &amp; then later just
unzip/unrar back from the archive backup &amp; run offline at that
patch/version? I've only ever had HL2 as a Steam game, though I got the box

You can certainly make backups but I don't know about it working offline
straight from re-install - never uninstall anything here... ;-)

There was once an issue with being offline (it would want to go online
and if you didn't let it, it got stroppy) but that was apparently fixed
in a patch a year or so ago

BTW - never backed up a download either.  if I swap out the HD or
reinstall XP I just re-download everything from Steam.

Yeah, I just bought Darkstar One at Target for $8, but it was $20 on
Steam.

I'm getting a bit irritated with it, since it acts like spyware,
poping up adds all the time, and I've only had it for a couple weeks.

I bought the orange box, I only installed Portal to begin with, when I
tried to install HL2 it wouldn't even let me install from the disks I
got, I had to install by dl/ing.

Thinking about it now, I'm really irritated with it.

It'll pop-up 'news' on start up only.  There are no 'pop-ups' at any
other time.

When I boot Steam up I might get one or two ads for games just released
or on discount and sometimes its news about patches.  Sometimes there
will be no news and therefore no pop-up.  I don't notice it TBH unless
its news that interests me (such as Valve just buying Turtle Rock).

Admittedly the last couple of weeks have been busy for Valve with
GOTY's, buying other devs and the release of Rockstar's catalogue so
there has been a little more news than normal (still only on start up)
but how is this like Spyware?

Have you set it up for offline play?  Ensure you have set up your games
to never update - right-click on each game and choose 'properties' and
then 'updates'

Also go into Steam settings and 'friends' and untick the 'automatically
sign into Friends when I start Steam'

You can also block it in your firewall if you want to go that far

Haven't done this for a long, long time so I need to think whether I've
missed anything...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the earlier patches.  :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that have been made for this game. I picked it up for $10 along with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the two Shadowgrounds games which I paid $12 as a package.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i just bought Bloodlines, but paid $20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Amazon makes it pretty easy)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what's the address for Steam?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (i tried www.steam.combut that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  doesn't look like it)
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bear in mind Steam is a delivery service.  Your games work through it
&gt;&gt;&gt; and won't work without it.  Like Windows Live but better.  Folk seem to
&gt;&gt;&gt; love it or hate it.  I'm in the 'love it' camp

&gt;&gt;&gt; Have a look.  Some games are at a great price but others can be had
&gt;&gt;&gt; cheaper retail.  Lots of developers selling through it though so plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt; of choice

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just bought Darkstar One at Target for $8, but it was $20 on
&gt;&gt; Steam.

&gt; Always will be best to shop around.

&gt;&gt; I'm getting a bit irritated with it, since it acts like spyware,
&gt;&gt; poping up adds all the time, and I've only had it for a couple weeks.

&gt; It'll pop-up 'news' on start up only.  There are no 'pop-ups' at any
&gt; other time.

&gt; When I boot Steam up I might get one or two ads for games just released
&gt; or on discount and sometimes its news about patches.  Sometimes there
&gt; will be no news and therefore no pop-up.  I don't notice it TBH unless
&gt; its news that interests me (such as Valve just buying Turtle Rock).

&gt; Admittedly the last couple of weeks have been busy for Valve with
&gt; GOTY's, buying other devs and the release of Rockstar's catalogue so
&gt; there has been a little more news than normal (still only on start up)
&gt; but how is this like Spyware?

Ooops... meant to also say...

Go into Steam settings and untick 'Notify me about additions or changes
to my games, new releases and upcoming releases' under Interface

&gt;You can certainly make backups but I don't know about it working offline

&gt;There was once an issue with being offline (it would want to go online
&gt;and if you didn't let it, it got stroppy) but that was apparently fixed

That's ok if you have b/width to burn, but some of us with 512Kb adsl
(albeit totally unlimited), that could be a lengthy proposition. I really
would like to know if Valve have fixed Steam to allow easy backups &amp;
reinstalls, so you can just take off straight after a system rebuild, reload
the game, patch as usual &amp; off you go.

Yeah, up to 8MB here, (I get around 6).  However it's always been the
case (maybe not widely known) that if you just copy the Valve folder to
another drive or DVD you can just copy it back after your rebuild,
delete the clientregistry.blob file, boot up and sign in.  A new
clientregistry.blob file is made and you're good to go.  You retain all
your patches, mods etc this way.

Additionally if you right-click on individual games then you get the
option to backup the game files or go to 'File' 'Backup games' to back
up the lot.  There are several ways of doing it.

Cool - tx for that. DVD-Rs are much cheaper than disk space or b/width &amp; I
wanted to offload my HL2 &amp; Ep1 installs to recover some disk space on my C:
drive, but didn't want to go through the entire painful reinstall of 5 or 6
CDs + online decryption + patching - arggghhh!!! ;) I'll fully patch
everything up to date, then if I do reinstall in a year or two it hopefully
won't be such a long process to get things up to date. So much for install
media being your 'backup copy' lol. Most mmos are just as painful unless as
a low b/width sub you can find ways to back the installed files up.

Because I only have 2 physical drives (2x160Gb SATA 7200s) &amp; my D: drive is
my storage drive that gets a constant P2P thrashing, so I'd get even worse
performance out of apps/games there. Imo, multiple partitions on the same
drive don't provide enough of a performance boost over a single one to
bother, assuming you defrag &amp; do the housekeeping on the single
partition/drive regularly. I'd rather just have a single large-ish bucket &amp;
manage it all by directories. Happy to be proven wrong, as always ;)

I'd go with the new 4.5 update with installer. Finally an .exe file where
all you have to do is run it like any other patch. For some reason the patch
zip files take forever to un-zip. When you go to DL the file make sure it
says .exe not zip. I thought I was getting the installer version and I also
though it was inside the zip file. It took my 3GHz Core 2 over 2 hours each
to unzip the 4.4 and 4.5 zip files! Then after all that I realized I'd got
the wrong file. The 4.5 exe installs fast and it sure beats waiting for the
zip to up zip! Keep up the good work! JLC

I personally much prefer to keep anything away from my C: drive that

the C: partition.  A small C: partition means a very speedy backup of
all critical data. Games can readily be re-installed. I do quite a lot

Are you using Winzip ?

If so, there might be something wrong with your system... Yes, the
archive has over 6000 files, but most of them are pretty small. Maybe
you have a badly-behaving virus-killer looking at the files as they
unzip?

ah, my bad!  i see at www.patches-scrolls.de/vampire_bloodlines.php
that the two 4.5 archives are *titled* 1.2 to 4.5 with/without installer!

so ok, i need the 13MB offical 1.2 patch

anyhow, 4.5 zip = 219MB, 4.5 exe = 157 MB

61 MB difference, which with dialup will take
roughly an extra 4-to-5 hours to download!

i also see that the 3.5 zip is &quot;only&quot; 185MB

one of the walkthruoughs that i got at www.gamefaqs.com
mentioned that they'd played thru with the unofficial
2.3 patch, presumably done by Werner

i didn't try to find that patch (to check the size),
but for those interested in playing thru Bloodlines
at least *twice*, maybe that's the sweet spot?  :)

d/l the 2.3 zip, and then load the game, do the
official 1.2 patch, and then only do the basic
part of the 2.3 zip and play away.  :)

then uninstall, d/l the 4.5 exe (or later), and then
load the game again, do the official 1.2 patch again,
and then do the full exe update.  :)

hmmm...

i see that
www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/vtmb/downloads.html?om_act=convert&amp;om;_clk=fil...
shows:
ver 1.9  = 30.7MB
2.1a = 50.7MB
2.2  = 64.9MB
2.6  = 86.8MB

i could deal with 2.6's size, provided
that it does a  2 step update (i.e.
1st basic and then the remainder)

perhaps Werner could comment?

bill (no further comments of mine (below))

anyhow, from Werner's 2.6 readme:
&lt;&quot;Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines unofficial retail patch v2.6

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines unofficial patch 2.6
---------------------------------------------------------

This is an unofficial patch for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines by Troika
Games. It is built upon Dan Upright's great unofficial oma patches and works for
english retail and Direct2Drive versions only!

To install it extract this archive into your game folder keeping the directory
structure intact and backup any files being overwritten if you want to remove it
later. A complete reinstall is another option.

This patch attempts to fix many bugs and improve other things but no guarantees
are made, since not everything could be tested. It can be installed easily on
top of the official 1.2 patch from Troika Games.

The more basic changes are listed at the top of the version history, then bug
fixes and more. It is recommended to start a new game after patching to avoid
odd behaviour, like e.g. humans becoming vampires.

Because of the restoration of the histories the patch comes with the original
config.cfg, so change all the options to your liking again. If you get problems
with the histories in the tutorial just skip it!

v2.6
----
Added missing xp for plague quest and fixed Hannah quest state bug.
Made Tseng not offer blood as he doesn't even know about vampires.
Venus will now give you a constant $250 payment when you visit her.

Removed another double Malkavian line and clarified two quest logs.
Fixed a bug that reset Yukie's quest if you spoke with Ming again.&quot;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Er, just curious. Why do you install games on your C: drive?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because I only have 2 physical drives (2x160Gb SATA 7200s) &amp; my D: drive is
&gt;&gt;&gt;my storage drive that gets a constant P2P thrashing, so I'd get even worse
&gt;&gt;&gt;performance out of apps/games there. Imo, multiple partitions on the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;drive don't provide enough of a performance boost over a single one to
&gt;&gt;&gt;bother, assuming you defrag &amp; do the housekeeping on the single
&gt;&gt;&gt;partition/drive regularly. I'd rather just have a single large-ish bucket &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;manage it all by directories. Happy to be proven wrong, as always ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;--
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nostromo

&gt;&gt;I personally much prefer to keep anything away from my C: drive that
&gt;&gt;could crash the partition. And I only bother to systematically image
&gt;&gt;the C: partition.  A small C: partition means a very speedy backup of
&gt;&gt;all critical data. Games can readily be re-installed. I do quite a lot
&gt;&gt;of professional video-editing. All that data is manipulated on a
&gt;&gt;couple of separate hard-drives and I image in-process video work
&gt;&gt;regularly to a large external USB 2.0 drive.... transfer-rate is ~ 1.5
&gt;&gt;Gbytes per minute.

&gt;You're probably right &amp; I should be a bit more organised where my personal
&gt;computing is concerned, considering my middle name professionally is
&gt;'organisational'! ;) I may well consider doing just what you suggest on my
&gt;next system or reinstall of this one - cheers John.

Btw, how do you get around the annoying 'feature' of Windoze when apps want
to install themselves in C:\Program Files, many which do it w/o even asking
you? I'd love to just have the OS on a nice, small 10Gb partition for
imaging, but this one nuisance + the creeping doom of windows disk usage has
always deterred me. I also have a 4Gb fixed swap file which I've left in the
root dir of C: drive, again because the D: drive is a P2P thrash drive &amp; I
thought it made more sense to keep the swap file away from that constantly
used &amp; heavily fragmented drive. Any/all advice much appreciated.

I allow the MS Windoze apps, Professional third-party apps and key

I never install any games in the C: partition. For some games you do
need to manually intervene by clicking Browse on the install-directory

allow you to choose something other than C:\Program Files for the

Those are mostly what I'm talking about, plus some games &amp; other mickey
mouse s/ware that has on occasion just dumped things under the root dir
on C:, or in Program Files, without so much as asking.

The point here is, if you're still installing Windows software (MS &amp; 3rd
party) to your C: drive, you've lost control &amp; can't say with any
certainty how big your partition will need to be. Plus you'll still
suffer from fragmentation due to constant (un)installing, so apart from
imaging a nominally smaller partition, what are the real benefits? None
I can see.

My grand vision was to have an almost static C: partition (around 10Gb)
with just the OS on it. Never grows (well, hardly, apart from MS's
stoopid all-DLLs-in-one-bucket design) &amp; you can maintain it &amp; image it
very easily.

You can get significant swapping benefits if you create a fixed size
swap file, preferably away from the OS drive, of about twice the size of
your physical memory. Give it a try - you might notice windows starts
up quicker &amp; apps thrash a bit less.

my one guess is that the size diff is due
to use of a different compression program

anyway fwiw i went with the 1.9 version.
i got lucky (with gamespot, Sunday afternoon)
and it &quot;only&quot; took 2.6 hours.  :)

fwiw, with the 2.6 readme (available on
gamespot without doing the d/l) Werner
used the word word &quot;basic&quot;

3.2 also uses the word &quot;basic&quot; (didn't check 3.1)

2.2 doesn't seem to have an included separate readme.  :(

2.1a has readme for 2.0, with no mention of &quot;basic&quot;

1.9 readme does not use &quot;basic&quot;

with Win XP Pro, you can live with a 10GB

D: or E: (i prefer E: and i set up C: and

the &quot;owner&quot; is, whereas NTFS does (at least,

i used to do that with Win98SE

fwiw, i also used my above partitioning

a couple of times install apps filled
defaulted to the C: drive and went bad
and filled up the partition

&gt;The point here is, if you're still installing Windows software (MS &amp; 3rd

&gt;suffer from fragmentation due to constant (un)installing, so apart from
&gt;imaging a nominally smaller partition, what are the real benefits? None
&gt;I can see.

Huh? Uninstall ? Why ? I seldom uninstall anything in my C: partition.
No need. The only changes typically to my C: directory contents are
the result of Windows/Office updates and an occasional defrag every
few months takes care of these disturbances. Quite different from the
games situation, which I customarily uninstall after playing
through... especially the Single-player-only games, or those in which
I have zero interest playing the MP component.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;My grand vision was to have an almost static C: partition (around 10Gb)
&gt;with just the OS on it. Never grows (well, hardly, apart from MS's
&gt;stoopid all-DLLs-in-one-bucket design) &amp; you can maintain it &amp; image it
&gt;very easily.

&gt;&gt; I never install any games in the C: partition. For some games you do
&gt;&gt; need to manually intervene by clicking Browse on the install-directory
&gt;&gt; screen. Some games  alternatively use a &quot;Custom Install&quot; setting to
&gt;&gt; allow you to choose something other than C:\Program Files for the
&gt;&gt; target install-folder.

&gt;Well aware of all that. All good s/ware installers should allow you to
&gt;choose your dest drive/dir.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd love to just have the OS on a nice, small 10Gb partition for
&gt;&gt;&gt; imaging, but this one nuisance + the creeping doom of windows disk usage has
&gt;&gt;&gt; always deterred me.

&gt;&gt; My C: directory (XP Pro) has around 12Gbyte occupancy. (The partition
&gt;&gt; size is 20Gbytes.)  Remember that I also have some rather large
&gt;&gt; professional apps on the C: drive. I use my faithful old workhorse
&gt;&gt; Drive Image 7.03 to image the partition about once per week With
&gt;&gt; &quot;medium&quot; compression Including a full blockverify it takes about 15
&gt;&gt; minutes to image the C: drive to an external hard-disk. ( CPU X2 4400+
&gt;&gt; Toledo )

&gt;I'm only taking backups using Nero BackIT to rotating DVD-RWs every
&gt;week. Must invest in an external USB drive methinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also have a 4Gb fixed swap file which I've left in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; root dir of C: drive, again because the D: drive is a P2P thrash drive &amp; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought it made more sense to keep the swap file away from that constantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; used &amp; heavily fragmented drive. Any/all advice much appreciated.

&gt;&gt; I just let Windows decide swap file space. All resident in the C:
&gt;&gt; partition.

&gt;You can get significant swapping benefits if you create a fixed size
&gt;swap file, preferably away from the OS drive, of about twice the size of
&gt;  your physical memory. Give it a try - you might notice windows starts
&gt;up quicker &amp; apps thrash a bit less.
">

Have tried. No significant benefit on my machine. Maybe the 2GByte of
RAM helps most of the time.

Ah, yes I forgot about that in my communications with Nostromo. I do
keep track of the few games that use the My Documents/My Games
directory, and that does creat a disturbance to the size and
fragmentation of the C: drive, but it is small peanuts unless the
player stores a large number of saved-games and never deletes them.
Like you, I would have some concerns moving the My Documents directory
to any location other than the C: partition. Whenever I delete a game
that uses the My Documents directory, I also check that the associated
contents of My Documents are also deleted.

&gt; anyway fwiw i went with the 1.9 version.
&gt; i got lucky (with gamespot, Sunday afternoon)
&gt; and it &quot;only&quot; took 2.6 hours.  :)

&gt; fwiw, with the 2.6 readme (available on
&gt; gamespot without doing the d/l) Werner
&gt; used the word word &quot;basic&quot;
">

sorry for the possible confusion of the
above two mentions of &quot;2.6&quot;.  one is an
hour ref, and the other is a version ref

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3.2 also uses the word &quot;basic&quot; (didn't check 3.1)

&gt; 2.2 doesn't seem to have an included separate readme.  :(

&gt; 2.1a has readme for 2.0, with no mention of &quot;basic&quot;

&gt; 1.9 readme does not use &quot;basic&quot;
">

fwiw, my best guess at this point is that
i misread the &quot;basic&quot; word into thinking
that with recent zip files one could do
1st a &quot;basic&quot; fixit update (keeping close
to the original released package w/1.2 patch),
and then follow-up with the remainder

my bad

i've very glad i went for the small 1.9 version

fwiw#2, i'm also very glad that i went for the
ver. 1.9 d/l (30.7MB) coz the zip turned up
with *two* CRC errors!  :(

so either my d/l manager has problems
(which i'd hardly want to discover when
doing an ~ 200MB d/l (~14-to-20 hrs dialup!),
or there are two CRC errors on the gamespot
site for Werner's 1.9 version

which means i'll have to do the almost
3 hour d/l of 1.9 again, to verify which
is true.  i'll post again (here) on this
by next Sunday night

fwiw#3, i tried 4 different unzip programs

1. 1st, whatever is packaged with the fairly
recent PowerDeskPro6 (didn't work)

2. then two very old DOS programs (pkunzip
and unzip386 (InfoZip), and both had problems
with names longer than 8.3 as well as very
long directory-path/file-names

(this done with the 30MB zip file in another
partition:\directory G:\1, which only had
the 30MB zip in the high \1 subdirectory)

3. 7zip; not sure if it's a 2nd zip in PowerDeskPro6
or something i d/l'd 2/3 years ago (from somewhere)
and which id'd the two problem files but did the
whole unzip (including the two problem files)
without quiting

the game is playing fine.  :)

too soon to know if i'm going to like
it better than VTM-Redemption

Exactly. The major gaming sites do only accept normal ZIP archives as
these are handled by Windows XP itself but the installer uses the much
better 7ZIP compression. This explains the file size differences.

The basic patch is only available from versions 3.x forward and I would
not recommend installing one of the older patches. Better go official 1.2
first, which is quite playable, and then get 4.5 from a friend with DSL.

Goddam neverwinter nights 2, and not fixed as far as I know.

I have an 8 gb drive as my C: only ran into problems with NWN2,
everything was fine before that.  I occasionally check for
fragmentation, but there's never any to worry about over the last 4 or
5 years since I last built it.
