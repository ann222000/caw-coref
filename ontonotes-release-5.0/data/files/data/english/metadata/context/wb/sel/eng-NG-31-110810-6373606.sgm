1. create an iso that just contains our packages and make sure we can
install it - no automation.
2. once that is working and can be duplicated by the developers, we
move to the automation part.
3. after that is working and can be duplicated by the developers, we
move to the integration of the initial configuation system.

i am researching and figuring out how to make a custom debian iso. if
anyone else has already done this and has knowledge please step up so
we can knock out 1 and automate the process of building the iso.  the
process of creating the iso shouldn't be manual it should be
automated.

i think it would be best to download the packages we want to include
that way we always get the latest versions.

Do we want to pull packages from Debian repositories?
I've used PDK with DCCA to make a base distro. It worked well but it isn't
quite pure Debian.
I'll talk with the PDK developer and see if it can be used with just debian
repositories instead of the progeny ones.
DFS looks like its the way to go for now depending on ease of use but PDK
would simplify things.

Yes I was looking through them last night. CDD is more or less
specifications for debian sub projects. From what I've seen they are pretty
much just pulling specific debian packages for certain purposes and certain
userbases not really distros. It will help though

from the howto they are actually building isos which are distros.  so
i think it maps really close to what we need.  i will do some testing
to verify my assumptions.  unless we have different meaning of
distros.

&gt; &gt; i think it maps really close to what we need.  i will do some testing
&gt; &gt; to verify my assumptions.  unless we have different meaning of
&gt; &gt; distros.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes I was looking through them last night. CDD is more or less
&gt; &gt; &gt; specifications for debian sub projects. From what I've seen they are
&gt; &gt; pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; much just pulling specific debian packages for certain purposes and
&gt; &gt; certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; userbases not really distros. It will help though

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. create an iso that just contains our packages and make sure we
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; install it - no automation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. once that is working and can be duplicated by the developers,
&gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move to the automation part.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. after that is working and can be duplicated by the developers,
&gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move to the integration of the initial configuation system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i am researching and figuring out how to make a custom debian iso.
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone else has already done this and has knowledge please step up
&gt; &gt; so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we can knock out 1 and automate the process of building the
&gt; &gt; iso.  the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process of creating the iso shouldn't be manual it should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i think it would be best to download the packages we want to
&gt; &gt; include
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that way we always get the latest versions.
