I know the US Navy was heavily involved in the Battle of the Atlantic
even before Pearl Harbour, which brought it into conflict with the
Germans.

What was the first time that the two navies directly engaged each other?

Generally reckoned to be September 4, 1941 when USS Greer and U-652
engaged each other with depth charges and torpedoes respectively.

Ultimately without effect to either.

Looser definitions of "navies directly engaged" might yield earlier
dates - for instance, the British PBY which relocated the Bismarck in
May, 1941, was piloted by an American naval officer.

If your definition of "engaged" includes damage/casualties, it would
be when U-568 torpedoed DD-432 USS Kearny; 17 October 1941, south of
Iceland, 11 dead.

Ensign Smith was something more than a "non-combantant observer" - he
was the PBY's pilot.

His situation was quite a bit more involved than that of the US

Personnally, I'd not be inclined to stretch the definition of "directly

There is no lack of people willing to stretch definitions to make
arguments.

Ensign Smith may have been a member of the US Navy, but he was
temporarily assigned to the another service (Coastal Command?).  He was
not under US Naval command. He was taking his orders from the military
of another country/government.

In Canada, this happens in modern day as well. There are large numbers
of Canadian Forces Personnel who do exchanges with other NATO
countries. There were Canadians fighting with the US Army in the
invasion of Iraq, and Canadians fighting there still, despite the fact
that the Canadian government didn't support the invasion. My
understanding is that in this situation, the exchange person is given
the option of staying with the unit they are assigned with or dropping
out of the program- the Canadian government/military did not/does not
just pull the plug on all exchanges.

In the case of an exchange prior to Pearl Harbour, surely the US
government would have considered the possibility/probability that
exchanged officers like Smith would end up in harm's way.

Thanks for the link; contemporary documents are always good to read.

But I must disagree that Smith was the pilot of the Catalina. He had been
taken along by the pilot as an official USN observer. As an observer, he was
allowed to take the controls, and it so happened that he was flying the
plane when it sighted Bismarck. But Smith was neither in command of the
plane nor its official pilot.

See http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq118-1.htm: "A British Catalina
aircraft of No. 209 Squadron, piloted by US Navy *observer* Ensign Leonard
B. Smith...".

British markings for 209 sqdn - WQ-Z as a squadron/aircraft code. Serial
number W8406 - although some sources identify the serial number as AH545.

But then, markings are hardly determinative.  The Polish AF flew
throughout WW2 in British markings while the RAF aircraft used during
the North African "Torch" landings carried US insignia.

Couple of questions...

Did the US and Germany still have diplomatic relations during this
time?

If the US and German navies were trying to kill each other in
September, and were succeeding in killing each other in October; why
did it take until December and Japanese involvement to get a
declaration of war of out of either side?

For one, note that the US did NOT declare war on Germany
in the wake of Pearl Harbor. Germany declared on the US.

That allowed Roosevelt to bypass one of the more contentious
decisions he had - how to get a war declaration on Germany.
There was plenty of sentiment for Germany at the time, as there
were many German immigrants in the US.

Hitlers death probably lost his reasons for that declaration,
but I would submit simple megalomania for the reason - at the
time, Hitlers plans were going without a hitch. Or, there may
have been an agreement between Germany and Japan that has yet
to be found, althogh that seems unlikely (errr, that such an
agreement has yet to be found or mentioned by somebody).

However, once that hurdle was removed by Hitler, obtaining
a war declaration on Italy was simple.

The German navy was not actively pursuing U.S.
flag ships. The attack on REUBEN JAMES was IIRC
inadvertent, as REUBEN JAMES interposed herself
between U-552 and convoy HX-156.

Likewise, the earlier attack on KEARNY occurred
while KEARNY was actively defending a convoy with
depth charges.

However, this Wikipedia article

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_American_shots_fired_in_World_War_II

suggests that the first "shot" by American forces
against Germany was a depth charge attack by
USS NIBLACK on April 10, 1941, when NIBLACK
was rescuing survivors of a torpedoed Dutch
ship and detected a a lurking U-boat.

Note that no US force inflicted any casualties in
these actions.

The first German prisoners captured by the U.S.
were two crewmen of a Ju 88 which was shot down
on a recon mission over Iceland in late April 1942.

The USA has no intention of declaring war on Germany, as the problem with
Japan was considered enough. The USA was expecting an attack on the US
mainland after Pearl.

The declaration of war against the USA enabled the British fleet to move

Not quite. Hitler engaged in an air supremacy war with the UK in 1940 and
lost. German surface ships were largely useless as they would be hunted down
and sunk in open sea by the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy had in place an
effective sea blockade on Germany. British bombers were bombing Germany.
Just before Pearl Harbour the Germans were defeated at Moscow with the USSR
taking 30,000 prisoners.

The Germans were going nowhere on both fronts and nowhere positive in the
desert too. Declaring war with the USA, for Germany meant they could openly
now attack US ships and convoys.  Their only real successes were in U-Boat
warfare at the time. Germany though it could make the merchant fleets of the
UK and USA ineffective. Doing that would starve the UK of raw materials and
US made equipment, reducing any threat in the west and in the desert,
although the desert could be supplied via the Pacific and Indian Ocean and
the Red Sea from the USA, with a very long supply line.

The Tripartite pact locked Germany into Japan, although there may have been
a get out clause as Japan was not attacked, although the trade sanctions
imposed by the USA, starving Japan of oil, which prompted the Pearl attack
may have been viewed as hostile.

The ship had positioned itself between an ammunition ship in the convoy
and the known position of a German U-Boat wolfpack.  She was hit forward
by a torpedo and her entire front end was blown off when a magazine
exploded.  She floated for 5 minutes before going down.  Of the crew, 44
survived, and 115 died.  Reuben James was the first US Navy ship sunk by
hostile action in World War II.

Surprisingly, outside of the concerned family and friends of the crew,
news of the sinking did not spark any strong public sentiment in the
U.S.  It was folk singer Woody Guthrie, who wrote a famous song "The
Sinking Of The Reuben James" immediately after the sinking, that kept
the incident from slipping into obscurity.

Chorus:
Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Alternate WI: TEXAS and NEW YORK patrolled and
maneuvered in the Denmark Strait (which is "between
NF and Greenland") starting early in 1941. These
patrols were intermittent - one ship would go out,
patrol for a couple of weeks, then return to the
U.S.; the other ship would then steam out. BISMARCK
passed through Denmark Strait during one of the gaps
in this program.

Shift around the dates a bit, and there could be a
full-fledged battle! The US task group included a
destroyer squadron, I'm sure. So though BISMARCK
would outgun and almost surely defeat TEXAS or
NEW YORK, she'd get hurt herself and would have
difficulty _not_ getting sunk by the destroyers.
(BISMARCK's only escort was the cruiser PRINZ
EUGEN.)

So take it from there: US and German battleships
slugging it out: TEXAS sunk by BISMARCK's shells,
BISMARCK crippled by TEXAS and then sunk by the
destroyers.

Claims that BISMARCK opened fire first (as she
probably would, having better radar and expecting
to encounter British ships at any moment). Howls
for war against the German "pirates". Howls of
"provocation" and "plot" from isolationists
(including the Reds, BARBAROSSA being still a
month ahead). Accusations that FDR deliberately
sent TEXAS to her doom.

I think maybe the U.S. does declare war. It's
not Pearl Harbor, but it's semi-close.

The casus belli will be much weaker - TEXAS
was not in US waters, TEXAS was out there,
where trouble could happen, by US action.

OTOH, Hitler can't repudiate BISMARCK to get off
the hook, for one thing. He'll claim that TEXAS
fired first, and demand a US apology. That won't
wash.

There will be opposition in Congress, but the DoW
will go through.

One side effect: US Reds will be really noisy
about this, calling for strikes and sabotage
against the "capitalists' war". They will rush
out to take the lead in what will be for a while
a substantial anti-war movement, and get their
names in the papers as such.

This will leave them with _tons_ of egg on the
face on 6/23/41, and they have to flip-flop.

You left out the Operation Crusader reverse in North Africa, but
no matter.

At that time, the U-boat war was still going on, and the Germans had
some reason to think they'd be more successful in 1942 than 1941.
The Germans were still apparently in strong positions in Africa and
the Soviet Union.

The Red Army had staged some fairly large attacks on the Germans before,
and had had limited successes.  As of December 10, the Germans had no
real reason to think that the Soviet winter offensives would prove
so strong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Germans were going nowhere on both fronts and nowhere positive in the
&gt;desert too.
">

They had prospects in both theaters (and Hitler didn't care all that
much about Africa, except that he didn't want to be thrown off the
continent).  A few months later, the Germans launched a really big
offensive against the Soviets.  It wasn't until that attack was repulsed
with a large German surrender that there was strong evidence that
Germany was losing.  Even then, it wasn't all that clear.

If we're dealing with actions as of early December 1941, we have to
examine the situation as it seemed at that time, and deliberately
avoid hindsight.  By December 10, 1941, I believe that the German
chance of winning against the Soviet Union had dropped greatly,
but I know a whole lot of things that no German could possibly know
at that time.

Declaring war with the USA, for Germany meant they could openly

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;now attack US ships and convoys.

Which they were not immediately prepared to do.  It was something like
two months before they attacked in a way they couldn't have before.
Remember that the German Navy was already attacking US ships and
US-escorted convoys, and had been since about September.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Tripartite pact locked Germany into Japan, although there may have been

There was.  There is also the fact that Hitler never let a solemnly signed
treaty stand in his way.

He had already broken faith with the Japanese, back in August 1939 when
he signed a deal with the Soviet Union in contravention of the Anti-
Comintern Pact, at a time when Japan and the Soviet Union were fighting
each other.

although the trade sanctions

">

Not by the terms of the treaty.  There is no reasonable equivalence
between refusing to trade with a country and attacking that country.
It was very clear that the Tripartite Pact didn't force Hitler to
declare war.

At the time, Hitler said that he'd rather declare war on somebody than
have them declare war on him, and he probably expected a US declaration
against him fairly soon, so he wanted to get his in first.  I really
don't think he saw the declaration as a big thing.  The German navy
was already fighting the USN, the US was providing big-time economic
support to Britain, and was violating neutrality in all sorts of ways.
Hitler underestimated the US as a fighting power, and didn't think
the US was all that much more of a problem as a full belligerent
than as something fairly close.

I don't think that carefully analyzing Hitler's thinking here is
all that profitable, since to him the declaration of war wasn't all
that important.

The History Channel had a "World at War" episode
on about a year or two ago on which they discussed
this period of our countries history. One of
the participants was a member of FDR's White
House Staff (Ambassador John Kenneth Gailbraith)
at the time and I quote from him on the subject
of the United States going to war with Germany
in December of 1941:

"When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor the
country was 100% for declaring War on Japan on
Dec 8th, but the majority of the country did
not want to declare war on Germany, so when
Germany declared war on the United States FDR
breathed a great sigh of relief because he knew
that Congress would not go along with the US
declaring war on Germany first"

Gallup Polls taken at the time tend to
support this view the following are the
results of a poll taken 11/22/41 just
before PH:

Question:

It has been suggested that Congress pass a
resolution declaring that a state of war
exists between the United States and Germany.
Would you favor or oppose such a resolution
at this time?

Favor...26% Oppose...63% No opinion...11%

No "may have been", the Tripartite Pact only triggered if one member
was attacked by a non-European power (i.e. the US). Japan attacking
Pearl Harbor did not trigger the Tripartite Pact, end of story.

The latest batch of US sanctions hadn't been considered to have

The US did not impose a naval blockade on Japan, therefore the
motivation behind the Pearl Harbor attack was nothing more than
Japan's own desire for further conquest.  Withholding trade, though
clearly not a friendly gesture, is not ordinarily viewed as a

It is likely that the first German prisoners captured were the 576
crew members of the luxury liner Columbus, which the captain
scuttled on Dec 19, 1939 rather than surrendering the ship to a
British man-o-war.

Enjoying a Caribbean cruise,the primarily American passengers had
safely disembarked in Havana. Their return trips were paid for by
the Germans. The liner then tried to sail back to Europe but was
being hunted by the British. One American skipper, Lieutenant
Commander Paul F. Dugan of the USS Cole, regretted in his Deck Log
of 17 Dec 1939 that the transmission of position reports in plain
language by US vessels gave the "kiss of death" to the Columbus. He
was sorry about the Cole being drawn into such a "wretched duty".

After the sinking off the American east coast, the merchant mariners
were fished from the sea by the eight inch gun cruiser USS
Tuscaloosa and interned mostly at Fort Stanton, New Mexico. Their
captivity lasted from 1939 until war's end. The US and Germany were
not at war in 1939. I visited the site at Fort Stanton some years
ago. There were a few sandy graves of those German seamen who had
died there. James McBride wrote a 1996 M.A. Thesis, University of
New Mexico, about the story. Title: Internment of SS Columbus Crew
during World War II.

There is something in what you say, nevertheless the US government
was placed in a near impossible diplomatic position by Japan's
insistence on continuing its war against China.  Since US oil
companies were supplying the majority of Japan's oil needs, oil
which Japan did *not* need for domestic use but which was largely
for the purpose of war making, while at the same time the US was
trying to persuade the Japanese to withdraw from China, the US
government can hardly be faulted for denying to the Japanese the
very means necessary to further their war aims.  The Japanese
government always had the option to end the war in China, which was
gaining them nothing, and pursue other means to satisfy their desire
for dominance in East Asia.

1) The US alone controlled 2/3 of world oil production.

2) The US induced other governments to join the embargo.
In particular, the British Empire and the Netherlands
government-in-exile joined the embargo, denying to
Japan oil from Brunei and the Dutch East Indies, and
also the Middle East. I believe Mexico was also
persuaded to join. The only major oil producer not
in the embargo was the USSR, which needed all its
oil for itself at the time.

Michele Armellini states it pretty well.
Mr. Titley, I urge you if you are still interested to read the Morison
book I cited earlier, esp. Chapter 2, "Short of War" (barely so!)
Excerpts:
"President Roosevelt's estimate that Hitler would overlook American
aid to England, rather than declare war, was absolutely right.
--accept destroyer deal and plenty more, because it knew very well
that the U-S- at war would be far more formidable the the U-S-
'short of war'.
The next unneutral measure was Lend-Lease -- 11 March 41
FDR said 'end of any attempt at appeasment -----'
the Nazis had to 'take it'--   Hitler, who attacked Russia in June 41
informed his navy chief in July that it was 'vitally important to
put off America's entering into the war for another one or two months.'
He wanted no 'incidents' calculated to provoke America"

Again, without being explicit, you sing a German apologist song.

The liner had discharged its passengers and non-essential crew in Cuba and
had then taken on additional oil and spares for the resupply of U-boats,
plus military cargo; and the crew had been partially militarised by the
calling-up of many into the KM reserve. As such, it was a perfectly
legitimate target for British action. Indeed, even as a civilian ship, it
was subject to capture as an enemy vessel. The RN gave the captain ample
opportunity to surrender the ship; he scuttled it instead, which under
international law is actually a hostile act.

If Hitler had not wanted his liners to be captured, he shouldn't have
invaded Bohemia-Moravia and Poland.

Incidentally, the US Navy had at the time a policy of shadowing and
reporting the position of *all* combatant nation vessels in US territorial
waters, including British warships. This policy was in force, IIRC, until
mid-1940. I wonder if Lt Com Dugan regretted reporting the locations of
British cruisers as well?

First thing, they still received oil from the USSR through Sakhalin.
Second, they still had more than a year of reserves, at the current

They'd be "starved" of oil in one instance only: if they wanted to enlarge

&gt; After the sinking off the American east coast, the merchant mariners

&gt; captivity lasted from 1939 until war's end. The US and Germany were
&gt; not at war in 1939. I visited the site at Fort Stanton some years
&gt; ago. There were a few sandy graves of those German seamen who had
&gt; died there.
">

In short, another of those oh-poor-Germans stories.

The London Naval Agreements accorded special protection to merchant
shipping, _provided that they did not carry out hostile behavior_. Note that
an attempt to avoid boarding and capture was considered _hostile behavior_,
which forfeited the merchant ship the right not to be attacked.
On October 17, 1939, that is before the Columbus scuttling, German subs were
ordered to sink all enemy merchant ships without warning, which means,
without giving them any chance of exercising their rights, above.
The order was not without justification, since the British had announced
measures and orders that gave Doenitz good reason to believe that resistance
by merchant vessels could be expected.

The outcome of the mutual decisions, orders and measures above, however,
changed de facto the status of the merchant shipping personnel into that of
servicemen of their countries' navies. I highlight "mutual", because it was
not a chain of decisions taken solely by the British; the Germans
contributed.
If the Germans were going to treat British merchant ships as British Royal
Navy warships, they were also going to treat the British merchant sailors as
British Navy personnel; then, there is no reason why the British should not
consider German merchant sailors as German Kriegsmarine personnel.

And assuming the US authorities agreed on such a classification, then it was
not only their right, but their duty, to intern a combatant's servicemen for
the duration of the war (Hague X 1907 Art. 15).

Note that the Columbus did attempt to escape and that its last act is an act
of resistance.

Of course, the Germans would have a claim to a different treatment of the
crew of that merchant ship if they had repatriated British merchant sailors
in compliance with Art. 6, Hague XI 1907. I have no evidence that they did,
but I'll gladly examine it if anybody can provide it.

In 1940, Japan was receiving about 1 million barrels a year of oil from
Sakhalin.  This contrasts with imports from the United States of just
under 30 million barrels a year.

Moreover, given the recent unpleasantness between the Japanese and
Soviets in Manchuria, the anti-comitern pact between Japan and Nazi
Germany, and the Soviet Unions's own increased need for oil with the
German invasion, the Soviets were unlikely to increase this amount -
though I'm unsure just how much this might have been increased in any
event..

Rather obviously, Sakhalin was not and could not become a source of
-significant- amounts of oil as it represented something less than 4% of
Japanese pre-war consumption.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second, they still had more than a year of reserves, at the current
&gt; consumption rate.

Well, most of the sources seem to set oil reserves at something less
than that.

But, the question is not really "current consumption rate" - rather, the
critical number would be full wartime consumption rate.  If Japan waits,
it no longer has the oil reserves to go to a "full wartime consumption
rate".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Presumably, were the Japanese to pull out of China and go to a full
"peacetime rate", the entire question becomes academic because that
would more than satisfy the US conditions for lifting the embargo.

But the Japanese are NOT going pull out of China and go to a peacetime
rate. It just wasn't politically possible given the Japanese psyche at
the time.  That wasn't necessarily an intellegent position, concededly,
but it was the way things were.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They'd be starved for oil eventually, absent abandoning the China
adventure. Once diplomatic efforsts to lift the embargoes failed, they
really were presented with only the two options of either abandoning
China or expanding the war. And any Japanese government which proposed
abandoning China would have rather quickly been deposed by the Japanese
military.

The embargo forced the Japanese to choose between giving up China or
expanding the conflict. Given the politically realities of the time, the
choice was rather pre-ordained.

Sakhalin oil was a very small portion of Soviet
production, and the Soviets had no easy way to
move it to the west. The Soviets also had ore-
existing contracts with Japan governing Sakhalin
oil. Also, IIRC they reduced deliveries to Japan
substantially from the 30s into the 40s.

Finally, the Sakhalin oil was only a small part
of what Japan needed for its war effort, and the
Soviets did not (and IMO could not) increase

IOW while the USSR did not join the embargo, neither
did they (or could they) do anything to break it,
even though the USSR was a major oil producer.

Well of course it was self interest!  What nation ever acted without
that consideration uppermost?  Britain did not make a pact with
Poland in 1939 because they were concerned about the plight of the
poor Poles!

The point is that if the USA was serious about wanting the Japanese
to end their war of conquest in China (and they were), then they
*had* to stop selling the Japanese the means to prosecute that war.
However, that does not mean the Japanese were without any other
option than to attack the US.  As has been discussed numerous times
in this forum and elsewhere, Japan *might* have made a lunge for the
British and Dutch oil fields in Southeast Asia without directly
attacking US possessions.  Such a strategy may have been risky,
given the geographical location of the Philippines, but how risky
was the Pearl Harbor gamble?

The bottom line is: either the US government ceased insisting that
Japan stop its war in China or it stopped selling them oil and
steel.  It could not continue to do both.  And I do *not* think the
US "wanted a hot war" in 1941.

It's pretty clear that the UK didn't want a hot war against Japan; it
was busy enough elsewhere. But it was willing to take what it perceived
as a minor risk. The subtle point I was trying to make is that perhaps
the US didn't want a hot war either, although willing to take the risk.

US foreign policy, as with most other nations of the time, was largely
based on self-interest but not entirely. And sometimes it's
self-interest worked in such ways that benefited other nations, such as
China.

Not yet.

What Hitler wanted was a series of short victorious wars against
isolated enemies.  While he had some admiration for the British
Empire, he likely would have come into conflict.

Britain and Germany are doomed by geography to be allies or
enemies, nothing in between.  Britain stands astride Germany's
trade routes with the rest of the world by necessity.  If the
two are allies, this doesn't matter.  Otherwise, it puts
one of the parties at a disadvantage, depending on who can
dominate the seas around Britain.

Britain had

if allowed to do so.  Britain's policy was that that country would

Nope - the Brits had plenty of reason to want Hitler stopped.

The British fear was that, if Germany was left to its little wars
of conquest, Germany could eventually build up sufficient sea and
air power to defeat Britain.

It was going to get worse.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff were concerned
that shipping resources to Japan was going to interfere with the US
military expansion, for one thing.  For another, Japan's foreign
exchange supplies were not infinite, and the Japanese economy was
not nearly as strong as Britain's.  Japan could not produce export
goods in large quantities and fight the war in China.

This means that, by Spring 1942 (Willmott's estimate), Japan would
be effectively bankrupt, and unable to pay for US oil and iron.

Historically, the Japanese were determined to do almost anything rather
than give up the war in China.  I do not believe they would have
quietly admitted failure just because they ran out of foreign
exchange.  I think they would have acted much as historically, and
would have tried to seize resource-containing areas (such as the
Dutch East Indies) to keep the war going.

There's also the fact that the last and strictest embargo was in
response to the Japanese move into southern Indochina.  That move
was not related to the war in China.  It was an independent resource
grab and the seizure of bases useful for later conquest.  It was
the start of the Japanese attacks continued in December 1941.

If we can say the Japanese were politically unable to stop the China
war, we can also say that the US was politically unable to subsidize
the China war by giving Japan whatever Japan asked for.  Therefore,
any embargo was doing no more than hastening the inevitable, and
the last embargo was a response to Japanese aggression, and not a
starting cause.

What right did the US have to intern these merchant mariners three

was changed to imprisonment behind barbed wire once the US

&gt;&gt; scuttled on Dec 19, 1939 rather than surrendering the ship to a
&gt;&gt; British man-o-war.
&gt;&gt;One American skipper, Lieutenant Commander Paul F. Dugan of the USS Cole,
&gt;&gt;regretted in his Deck Log of 17 Dec 1939 that the transmission of position
&gt;&gt;reports in plain language by US vessels gave the &quot;kiss of death&quot; to the
&gt;&gt;Columbus. He was sorry about the Cole being drawn into such a &quot;wretched duty&quot;.

&gt;Again, without being explicit, you sing a German apologist song.

If you feel comfortable with personal attacks and your notable bias,
so be it. But intolerance is not a virtue, so perhaps it should be
possible to put up with one voice which points to little known facts
now and then. You may prefer lily-white embedded stories, I do not.

&gt;The liner had discharged its passengers and non-essential crew in Cuba and
&gt;had then taken on additional oil and spares for the resupply of U-boats,
&gt;plus military cargo;

Wrong. You offer only allegations. Quote:

"The Mexican government had been closely observing the Columbus
since the liner arrived [in Veracruz]and continued surveillance of
the crew and the supplies being brought aboard or taken ashore. When
she anchored, the Mexican customs officials conducted a thorough
search of the vessel. They found no evidence of guns, ammunition, or
naval supplies."(Source: James J. McBride, _Internment of the SS
Columbus Crew During WW II_, 1996).

Of course now you can dismiss the Mexicans and tell us that they
don't know how to search a ship...

&gt;Indeed, even as a civilian ship, it was subject to capture as an enemy
&gt;vessel. The RN gave the captain ample opportunity to surrender the ship;
&gt;he scuttled it instead, which under international law is actually a hostile act.

Sure, sure. I understand that this beautiful vessel would have been
so much better off in British hands than on the bottom of the sea. I
love this: "The RN gave the captain ample opportunity to
surrender..." The captain had other ideas. He stayed with his ship
to the end, and he stayed with his men during their captivity in the
desert. Incidentally, they turned the desolate patch of land into a
garden.

Every right. Absolutely. And even a duty.
See Article 11 of Hague Convention V 1907, and Article 24 of Hague
Convention XIII 1907, dealing with the rights and duties of neutral powers
and persons in case of war on land and on the sea.
Troops of a belligerent that happen, in whatever way, into the territory of
a neutral, cannot leave it for the duration of the war.

An argument could be made if these men had had the right to the status of
merchant sailors. But the legal issues I raised, and that you very
significantly chose to cut away without discussing, coupled with the factual
issues raised by Mr. Clark, demonstrate that these men were rightfully
treated as servicemen of a belligerent ending up in neutral territory.
That's internment. Very fair.

Furthermore, the status of internment

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; was at war.

Very rightly so. Most people, by the way, would have said "once Germany
declared war on the US". At that point, they had become POWs. I'll bet that
if they had been still treated as internees, you'd be now making a fuss
about their being denied the POW status they were entitled to.
And internees under Hague 1907 had less and less defined rights than POWs
under Geneva 1929.

Mexico was at odds with the US,Dutch and UK Oil Majors, having
Nationalized their Oilfields and kicking them out in 1938.

The US and the others muscled Mexican Oil off the World
market for the most part,similar problem to what Japan ran into.

You got Oil, you also need to move it.

Mexico was lacking in Refineries and Tankers(had been using
US Flagged hulls) and lost US capital access, so was running  a
series of Barter deals with the Axis nations, but wasn't able to
transport much beyond unrefined Crude in the few vessels they acquired.

It took a new Mexican President for US-Mexico relations to
improve in late 1940, which dried up that source for Japan
and Germany
