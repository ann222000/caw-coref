Not surprising at all, as I've said in the past, GM just doesn't "get
it" and they will likely continue to flounder in the market because of that.

On the contrary, GM does get it. You just have to look at the new
Pontiac Solstice roadster and the JD Power studies that show massive
increases in reliability and build quality.

The main issue is that all of of the US car makers are being killed
under massive union contracts that require the manufacturers to pay 100%
of health care costs to all union employees and retirees. This burden
keeps all of them from putting money where it needs to go: updating
product lines, improving product quality and modernizing factories.

Many Saab enthusiasts say only a Sweden built Saab that is made by an
independent Saab corporation is a true Saab. I have heard story after
story stating that GM Saabs suck compared to Scania Saabs. That is not
true. For every Saab Snaab, there is a "never again" person who vows
that they will never buy one again. This is true of Scania as well as GM
Saabs. My parents had an 87 9000 that was not a keeper, two tranies and
multiple electrical foibles convinced them such. My first Saab, an 85
900, had to have the entire ignition system replaced twice. Saabs have
always been "high maintenance" vehicles and every one I talk to, even
the fans, seems to agree with that on one level or another. You have to
keep up on the maintenance or you're screwed.

I'm not dissing the Snaabs out there, I just think GM is not much worse
than Scania (and their Fiat partnership) was.

I agree - take a look at the Pontiac Solstice roadster.  That's all
you'll be able to do, though - look.  If you walk into a dealer, tell
her/him that you want one and that you've got a trunk full of twenty
dollar bills with which to purchase one, they won't be able to give you
one for the forseeable future.  Massive underproduction that was
delayed past the anticipated April/May release date (right to the
beginning of winter, PRIME roadster weather) has created a bit of
supply problem.

So, you see, while the Pontiac Solstice might indeed be an example of
daring design, rigid chassis, and a fun drive for the price (not quite
a Miata killer, but not bad), it's after all just another example of
General Motors' "almost-but-not-quite" marketing that leaves many Saab
owners wanting.

OH, and why haven't I started paying GM-priced labor at the Saab
dealer?  I've been holding my breath for that benefit of the takeover
to show itself ;)

See, here's the thing.  The most important factor in a buyer/owner's
experience is not the design team or the build quality... no.  It is the
dealership that the end-user must endure after the initial purchase.  In
many non-domestic marques the dealerships service departments are the
weakest link in the equation.
