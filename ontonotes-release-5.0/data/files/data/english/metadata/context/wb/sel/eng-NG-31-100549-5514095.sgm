Shell's 100-RON fuel - what actually is it?

Shell in Australia now sells 100-RON fuel - just wondering if it's the
much-discussed ethanol-based fuel or if it really is a higher octane blend
of conventional crude-oil-derived petroleum fuel.

Is there anything on the web which details the exact composition of this
fuel?

At one time in the past refineries would add aromatics to the ethane
base gasoline to increase the octane rating.  Now, however, they are
using proprietary refining techniques which produce a high octane fuel.
I have not been able to discover the technique they are using.  Maybe
someone here knows?

Well the more interesting aspect is the fact it's 5 percent ethanol - the
Australian government wants 10 percent ethanol content but I suspect that
there have been problems with that mixture causing degradation in fuel
system components as well as unusual engine wear.

I know there is an official Saab list of cars that will run fine on
Ethanol-based fuel, but that's pretty useless without actual empirical
testing to get some 'field' results. 8-) The combustion performance of the
fuel is going to be markedly different to regular fuels not counting the
slightly higher RON rating.

I wonder what other GM car brands are saying in the enthanol fuel debate?

When I drove past a Shell outlet the other day the Optimax Extreme was
cheaper than the regular Optimax. That's either a ruse to get people to use
it, or it's actually because the stuff is cheaper to make. Perhaps there is
an Australian federal government subsidy in place to artificially keep the
price lower.

What's the story in other countries?

Thanks Joe. I'm aware of that issue already but most of us tend to not worry
about it. However now that we're seeing a push to use a cheaper hydrocarbon
in fuels (and it must be ultra-cheap if Shell, etc. are already making fuel
with it in commercial quantities). So the ballpark is changing a little.

Any bet the oil companies thrive on not having to reveal their exact fuel
composition data so that they can change the mixture to suit supply/demand
of the individual compounds that create the end-product.

Ethanol was for many years considered a fuel adulterant/contaminant in
North America. Then Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural products
corporation that now produces over 98% of North America's fuel ethanol,
revved up their lobbying machine. Over the course of a decade, what had
been correctly regarded as a cause of vehicle damage, driveability
problems and reduced fuel economy came to be pushed as an "environmentally
friendly" fuel additive, now mandated as a "pollution fighting" gasoline
ingredient in many areas. Most newer vehicles are built to tolerate up to
10% ethanol without short-term component damage or significant
driveability faults, but there is a drop in fuel economy due to ethanol's
lower energy content per unit volume as well as secondary effects. Older
cars are disregarded; their owners' lobbying groups aren't as loud or well
funded as ADM's. "Just buy a new car. Everyone wants a new car."

Ethanol has a lower heat of combution value than gasoline. However, it
does make water miscible with gasoline so it will help keep your fuel
line from freezing in the winter.  Otherwise its not of any advantage
to use with gasoline.  Why not use ten percent isopropyl alcohol.  It
has a higher heat of combustion than gasoline and is extremely
inexpensive.  Probably would attack the plastic and rubber components
in many fuel systems though.

Alcohols are superior motor fuels in many respects to gasoline, but
the cheap price of gasoline because it was actually a byproduct of
kerosene distilling made it the standard fuel.So manufacturers used the
cheapest possible materials in their fuel systems, which weren't
compatible with alcohols.

Alcohols have been sold as motor fuels in many countries for many
decades yet car manufacturers insist on using cheap gaskets, floats,
seals, and diaphragms that are not alcohol proof.

If you have an older car, you can bitch, whine and moan or you can do
what you should anyway and rebuild the fuel system this winter. Use
alcohol proof flex line, fittings (I would go with AN fittings) floats
and gaskets. Then you can motor on happily with the alcohol that ADM
lobbying is doing us the favor of making them supply anyway. Cars 30 or
40 years old are due for it anyway.

I was assured by an Esso rep that Esso's fuel does not contain ethanol.
Do you know for sure which Canadian brands do /not/ contain ethanol?

I ask because I am concerned about damage to my Integra's fuel system.

The real benefit of not revealing the ingredients is avoiding the
lawsuits launched by concerned parents and environmentalists when they
learn that their community and children are being poisoned by what the
oil companies are allowing to be released into the environment via the
gas pumps.

Ever wonder why the oil companies wouldn't release the details on the
exact contents of some of the storage containers that caught fire in
England this past week?  Just the stock "unknown liquids" or "fuels"
are burning from the tanks is what the BBC was reporting  (if I recall
correctly).

Better to say that you aren't exactly sure than to risk  having to
prove all of the substances you are adding to fuel to keep the cost
low and meet the vehicle manufacturers requirements are safe..

Oh well, it's only the air we breath,  nothing really important.  ;-)

Name ONE way they're superior. I'll name a bunch in which alcohols are
inferior:

-Lower energy content per gallon means you have to carry more.
-Incompatible with a wider range of fuel system materials.
-Completely different emissions spectrum (meaning you now have to worry
about cleaning up aldehyde emissions instead of HC emissions, so
different technology is required).
-Almost invisible flame means you can have a raging fuel fire that can't
be seen
-Stupid from an energy-balance perspective. It takes more energy to
prepare as a fuel than it releases when you burn it. When it comes to
plant-derived fuels, at least go with a direct product such as plant
oils- you get a better energy balance.

Alcohol does *not* require more energy to 'manufacture' compared to
gasoline. It's an 'old wives tale' that one.

Check out the FFV Saab 9-5 Biopower. Its power is significantly greater on
E85 compared to gasoline and provides similar mpg. This does require a remap
of the ECU of course and some fuel sytem components have been upgraded for
better E85 compatability.

I guess where we really need to head is along the idea of fuel cells instead
of attempting to continually graft new energy sourcing ideas onto existing
technology, despite it being 'tried-and-proven'.

Toyota, etc. have hybrid cars but they're not really in the same sphere of
research. I wonder if Saab's technical people in Sweden are doing any
research into using fuel cells?

What is E85? Is that fuel with 15 percent ethanol?

E85 is 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline added, for cold weather starting
and so you can see any flames if it catches on fire. Unfortunately, it
also means fighting an E85 fire with water is less successful. Water
fire extinguishment is the reason Indy racing went from using a
cornucopia of fuels to mandating straight methanol only.

Doesn't methanol also burn 'invisibly' too ?

Gasoline, bad idea. Alcohols, water works great because they are

As far as I know, amongst brands sold in Ontario, that'd be Esso and

You're just as wrong. Whether it does or doesn't depends on the processes
used, the feedstock, the grade and type of alcohol produced, and other

Fine and well, but a disappearingly small percentage of cars on the road
are Saab 9-5 Biopower FFVs. Cars not specifically engineered for E85 (or
any other alcohol blend, for that matter) produce less power and get lower
fuel mileage on such fuels than on gasoline.

You must be right.

That's why they don't release the composition information

Oh, and why for the 3 days following the fire they continued reporting

&gt; Fine and well, but a disappearingly small percentage of cars on the road

&gt; any other alcohol blend, for that matter) produce less power and get lower

That's because it's just been released.

Therefore the percentage is going to be continually increasing for some time.

The point is *exactly* that a car engineered to use E85 will outperform the
same vehicle on gasoline at a similar mpg ( may even be a better mpg under
some driving conditions ). In short, engineering innovation has provided a
superior product.

The FFV can also run on ordinary gasoline or any mix of gasoline and E85 so it
truly is flexible.

I never said that. I said that more energy goes IN to making alcohol
than you get BACK when you use it. The thing about gasoline is that its
tapping a HUGE reserve of energy captured over millions of years.
Growing crops and converting them to alcohol can't possibly match that,
at least not without devoting all the arable cropland we have to growing
fuel crops (and that's assuming the "organic" foods nuts don't have us
go back to stone-age farming practices that would leave 2 billion people
starving even if we used all arable cropland for food). Going straight
to vegetable OILS might come closer to being practical.

Cars not designed or modified for E85 or flex fuel use cannot be

Since gasoline has a higher heat value per gallon and per pound than

&gt;&gt; &gt; What is E85? Is that fuel with 15 percent ethanol?

&gt;&gt;  E85 is 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline added, for cold weather starting
&gt;&gt; and so you can see any flames if it catches on fire. Unfortunately, it
&gt;&gt; also means fighting an E85 fire with water is less successful. Water
&gt;&gt; fire extinguishment is the reason Indy racing went from using a
&gt;&gt; cornucopia of fuels to mandating straight methanol only.
&gt;I thought trying to extinguish a gasoline fire with water wasn't too clever in the
&gt;first place !

No it's not - flammable liquid fires generally require foam which smothers
the fire and cools the liquid at the same time, but you can you fine water
spray if the conditions are right since the spray will have the same effects
as foam.

I wouldn't think having fuel with a small ethanol content is going to make
fire extinguishment much different than with current fuel mixtures, though a
fuel which is primarily ethanol and/or methanol is certainly going to
require a different technique.

The biggest problem could come from the combination of the alcohol in the
fuel with the combustible materials that make up the car itself - all sort
of plastics, etc. which give off toxic smoke and fumes when heated and
oxidised.

It's a constant battle no doubt for car designers (even for Saab's tech
people) to come up with ways to implement features using materials that
effectively balance all the regular requirements of the automotive
environment with the risks and hazards that come about during acidents
and/or fires.

As an aside. We (local volunteer fire brigade) had a callout to a car fire
last night - a guys work ute loaded with tools and materials (he's a
self-employed carpet layer apparently) was stolen from where he lives about
10 km north and torched just down the road from the fire station at the
start of the national park. Called out just before midnight - totally
engulfed when we arrived 7 minutes later. Lots of bush in the immediate area
was also burning but the main concern now is that the car was torched over a
mulch pile which is still smouldering almost 20 hours later since last night
we couldn't get any water into that area as the base of the cabin and the
chassis were on the ground after the expensive alloy wheels melted onto the
ground. 8-)

Might put the pics I took today when the salvage truck came to remove what
was left of the vehicle online somewhere for everyone to look at...

Engine temperature is set by thermostat and/or ECM factors and the

If petroleum were much more expensive alcohols would be attractive

How can alcohol "increase engine power?"  It can't. Either the engine is
optimized for alcohol (and yes, you can extract a great deal of power
from engines that use alcohol as fuel) or an engine is NOT optimized to
burn alcohol. There's no direct comparison without changing the fuel
system and compression ratio.

Now if you do allow changing the fuel system, how do you compare?
Probably the best way is on engine size. For any given engine
displacement, setting it up to burn gasoline will net more horsepower
out of the engine since more chemical energy can be pulled into the
engine in the form of air/fuel mixture because the energy density of

In the late 1970s and early 1980s the USAC cars were putting out 1000+
bhp out of the 166 CID Turbo Offy. On gasoline it is doubtful much more

Alcohols allow radically more power to be produced in certain cases
because of alcohols' higher octane rating, and also the alcohol fuelled
engines can be run very rich which allows the alcohol to act as a
cooling medium.

The 1952 GM LeSabre show car used a clean-sheet-of-paper engine which
was dual-fuel, but not in the sense of the current FFVs. It had a
gasoline carburetor used for starting and cruising and a methanol one
which opened progressively at high power.

Yes it can.

It has a higher octane rating than gasoline and therefore can be used

Primary reason even when using nitro was the high octane of methanol.
Even so, if engine was to use a LOT of nitro, one had to back off on CR.

Again, an engine DESIGNED for that fuel. I don't argue that if you're
limited by an engine's cooling capacity, you might be able to do better
with alcohol. Or maybe not- gasoline with water injection might work better.

That's really no different than feeding a gasoline engine a lot of water
injection (ADI) to slow the combustion rate and control inlet
temperatures and detonation. The Reno air racers have probably taken ADI
further than just about any other motorsport- they run Rolls-Royce
Merlins at over 140 inches of manifold pressure (the race teams and
engine builders won't publish the actual number) with NO intercooling-
just ADI. Years ago, one of the Reno air race teams attempted to set up
and run a Wright R-3350 on alcohol because of all the assumptions you
just mentioned. It never worked, the engine always made more power and
was more reliable on avgas with ADI. Later, the Pond Racer was designed
with alcohol in mind, and would *probably* have worked except that it
didn't have adequate fuel capacity for  the full race length, plus pace
laps and cool-down. Switching it over to avgas resulted in perpetual
overheating because the cooling systems were inadequate for the higher
power density (among a lot of other problems that aircraft had that were
unrelated to the fuel, not the least of which was trying to use
automotive engines in a high-stress aircraft application).

But that means the CO2 has to be going somewhere. Either it's being absorbed
by something else in the planet's ecosystem taken as a whole unit (or
chemically react with other things in the atmosphere and become something
else), or the gas particles disappear into space.

So it's still being returned to the earth. It's the *rate* at which CO2 and
other pollutants are generated which is where the problems with any sort of
internal combustion process come from.

I don't think alcohol-based fuels are going to be any better that
petroleum-based fuels in that regard because even though the output gases
tend to be very different, the rate at which they're produced won't reduce
to anything like the point where the planet as a whole can deal with it.

Where things might change is in the ways that combustion product gases from
engines running on alcohol based or mixture fuels are dealt with globally.
Treaties won't do anything. Global catastrophy would - but nobody (not even
the nations that massively abuse the environment with internal combustion
product gases!) would want that to happen whilever we're bound to this one
planet for survival. 8-)

No the CR was probably 7 or 8 to 1. They were running in excess of

&gt; &gt;  Alcohols allow radically more power to be produced in certain cases
&gt; &gt; because of alcohols' higher octane rating, and also the alcohol fuelled
&gt; &gt; engines can be run very rich which allows the alcohol to act as a
&gt; &gt; cooling medium.

&gt; As the previous poster said, CERTAIN cases- not the case with unmodified

&gt; &gt;  The 1952 GM LeSabre show car used a clean-sheet-of-paper engine which
&gt; &gt; was dual-fuel, but not in the sense of the current FFVs. It had a
&gt; &gt; gasoline carburetor used for starting and cruising and a methanol one
&gt; &gt; which opened progressively at high power.

&gt; But what was compression ratio, and did it generate more power on
&gt; alcohol?  It is not that hard to make dual fuel engines- current E-85
&gt; engines are such dual fuel engines.

It was relatively low compression but it had a large Roots mechanical
blower. It required gasoline all the time, for starting and low power
operation. Methanol was for high power operation. If the methanol ran
out it could be driven but only at limited power.

The ecology of the planet was radically different 100 million or so years
ago
when the dinosaurs roamed around.  For the oil and coal reserves we have
today to
be formed there had to be an enormous amount of raw plant material.  The
Earth
was almost certainly far far warmer, far sunnier which provided the solar
energy to
grow the plant life, there was also far more shallow seas with enormous
amounts
of plant material as well.  And undoubtedly the atmosphere had a far higher
concentration of CO2 in it at that time, once again needed by the tremendous
plant growth.  A lot of this is backed up by the fossil record and by rock
strata.

I doubt very much that even if every scrap of land on the globe today was
covered
by forests that this would provide the amount of plant material to create a
carbon
cycle that would carry the amount of carbon locked up in the oil and coal
reserves.

The anti-global warming people would do well to read the latest National
Geographic
(January 2006) article Arctic Hunters on Thin Ice, a quote from that
article:

"...During the past few decades temperatures have risen in Greenland by more
than
2 degrees Farenheight - twice the global average - and the island's massive
ice
sheet, almost two miles deep in some places, has been melting faster than at
any
time during the past 50 years..."

"...Arctic biologists say the entire ecosystem is in collapse..."

The ironic thing about all of this is that during the early Earth's years
when
the supercontinent Pangea existed, there were almost certainly far, far
fewer species.  It wasn't until plate tectonics split everything apart and
the
landmasses became isolated, that the high species diversification became
possible and we saw so many more species evolve.

Today, with the ecosystem destruction and the carrying of so many different
species, both plant and animal, around the globe by ships and such, we are
seeing massive dieoff of many species.  With the global warming trends on
top
of that, we are basically turning the clock backwards 100's of millions of
years,
and if things keep up we will end up right back where we started from.
That's
great if you want to live on a planet full of dinosaurs I guess.  Too bad
they are
all extinct now.

There is always other options
Carbon capture and storage (for sake of argument in empty oil wells)
or.....
If the problem is too much solar heating it is theoretically possible
to put a solar reflector in space to cut the amount of solar radiation
reaching the earth. Keep, the polar caps cold and they won't melt.

But I suppose that would destroy the whole "global warming"
industry......

Perhaps we should slaughtered all the greenhouse gas producing
animals, Quit all transportation, figured out a way to feed the world
organically, eliminate Volcanic activity and prevent all forest
fires..

On second thought  I'll pay towards carbon capture, Keep driving my
Turbo and eating steak.  Gotta look at the bright side.  Think we've
beaten the global cooling that was predicted in the 1960'S !  Yeah !

The problem I see is that ethanol is a double whammy.  Not only do you

Not sure offhand but no different for gasoline if so. In fact, I looked

FWIW:  Until about 1950, a sugar cane refinery on the
island of Maui produced enough energy from the cane to
operate the plant and provide all the electricity for
the island.  Fermentation doesn't require much if any
energy.  So there'd have to be a substantial net energy
loss from distillation to result in an overall loss in
producing ethanol as the Brazilians are doing.

Almost any vegetable matter can be turned into Schnapps. :-)

Burning the "waste" vegetable matter can, in conjunction with solar
input, provide sufficient energy for distillation to fuel quality.
There need be no external fuel provided for distillation and related
processing.

(Controlled) combustion of the waste matter "completes" the carbon
cycle much more rapidly than using fossil fuel; with the fixing
cycle complete in a matter of years instead of millennia.

This is only true if your talking the kinds of foods that people are used
to eating (ie: wheat for example)  And if your including all the food that
needs to be grown to feed cattle to produce beef.

There are other foods that are much higher nutritionally, and require
much less fertilization.  However they are not common on the American
table.  And of course, beef is terrible as far as that goes.  Even buffalo
meat costs less per-pound to grow than beef does.

If tomorrow all white bread sales were halted and replaced with wheat bread
sales, it would probably drop the amount of wheat needed to produce
the same amount of nutrition obtained from bread by a 3rd.

This is one of these problems that seems to be a technical one but is
really a political one.  I'm not going to give up my burgers and fries
and Frosted Flakes and go on a veegan diet, unless you get the rest
of the country to do it.  And everyone else in the country has the
same attitude.  Even though if we all did, we would probably all
not be such lard-asses, would probably be a lot healthier, and it
would not require nearly as much farmland to feed us.

Must be the by-product of making all those 44 gallon drums of orange pulp
concentrate that Brazil also exports around the world. 8-)

I guess Brazil's economy and ecology is just right for producing and
marketting enthanol. I wonder if there are many Saab's in Brazil?

That justifies using another way to produce the ethanol (and to

Which are:

- insecticide/pesticide/fertilizer products most probably made mainly by
Monsanto (the company which cartel-manipulates the Glyphosphate market
and has a huge hand in GM [that's Genetic Modification!] investment) and
Bayer (who are the result of a world-war 2 German biological weapons
company that decided to try and look good by changing market focus). 8-)

- fuel/lubricant products mostly made by the big global oil conglomerates
which are also a cartel-manipulated industry.

While the environmental benefits of Ethanol fuel are high, so to are the
side-effects in terms of propping up global 'trade' artificially with the
potentially harmful flow-on effects to various segments of life on the
planet.

At least until a way is found to make energy consumption by us humans
'impact-neutral' on the global ecology of our planet. Shifting the fuel of
choice will just make the boundaries move around a little. We're still
transforming stored energy sources into other forms of energy much, much,
much faster than the ecology can re-assume back into stored energy sources.

After all even though we're 'eating' oil reserves like it's bread and butter
(well it is if you use margarine! lol), the planet is still making more of
it. We're using it 10^99 or greater orders of magnitude faster than it's
being created.

Shifting to ethanol fuels won't stop that - just make the 'picture' have a
different 'orientation'...

And it's how industry and governments shift around that 'orientation' that
affects things at the consumer's end.

I don't believe that "The US" is wedded to the idea.  However I
believe that a number of people in the administration &amp; their

Like anything else in the world it will take people with a lot of
financial backing to push for any change.  (hence the reason that
cities are so slow to adopt wireless internet coverage for example).

As for the 5 Litre V8, 20 years in the future?  If it's a Bio-Diesel
with particulate traps that allowes cylinder deactivation and is
connected to a hybrid drive train, that  might make sense.  VW gets
150HP from a 1.9L diesel now, what could a 5L Diesel put out with 20

Part of the problem I see is the idea that *more than 150 bhp* is needed for an
ordinary everyday road car !

My Saab 9000 only claims 150 bhp  and it's pretty damn quick by my reckoning. My
previous car had *only* 115 bhp but was still very agile. They are both cars
with manual transmissions though.

&gt;&gt; So less heat in winter, and only 10 to 20 cents difference from gasoline
&gt;&gt; (around here, anyway). And less mileage per gallon. Wow, what a huge
&gt;&gt; incentive to use this stuff!

&gt;  Engine temperature is set by thermostat and/or ECM factors and the

Around here, on a ten degree day with 20 MPH winds, it's hard enough
to get my nice hot 5.0L Ford warm with its 197 degree thermostat, on
gasohol. I'd imagine the reduced heat from E85 would leave passenger
compartments pretty chilly.

I found it amusing that (was it last year?) Al Gore gave his global
warming talk on the coldest day of the year, unseasonably cold for
the location.

I figure we can compensate for auto exhaust CO2 if all the environazis
stop exhaling.

My reading has suggested that farming today is more efficient than it

by eliminating the machinery that makes large-scale farming possible.

&gt; This is only true if your talking the kinds of foods that people are used

&gt; There are other foods that are much higher nutritionally, and require

&gt; If tomorrow all white bread sales were halted and replaced with wheat bread
&gt; sales, it would probably drop the amount of wheat needed to produce

&gt; This is one of these problems that seems to be a technical one but is
&gt; really a political one.  I'm not going to give up my burgers and fries
&gt; and Frosted Flakes and go on a veegan diet, unless you get the rest
&gt; of the country to do it.  And everyone else in the country has the

&gt; not be such lard-asses, would probably be a lot healthier, and it
&gt; would not require nearly as much farmland to feed us.

I have a better idea. Instead of stifling life in America for all this,
let's take the corn which we export to feed the world and use it instead
to produce fuel for our cars. That way we'll put less money into the
sheikdoms and make them pay more for what they need from us. Gives 'em
a taste of their own tactics *and* improves our balance of trade.

Checked the recent stuff from your FDA?
'Efficient farming' appears to have stuffed the product.
What a surprise.

Not necessarily. It all depends on how the heat from the engine is lost. A V
has more surface area than an inline so probably runs cooler anyway.

Climate change results in all kinds of varied effects depending where you live.
Some places have had their worst ever floods too. Generally, low rainfall seems
to be more widespread though.

It's not one single simple overall effect.
