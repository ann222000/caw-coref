This is what irritates the bugs of me, whenever people stamp themselfs
with staff the dont know anything about. When you pick a symbol be
sure you know what it means because the same symbol will not have the
same meaning to everyone so do a little research and make sure you
know what it means if you are happy with it.

If the people like the stuff enough to stamp themselves with it,
that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Surely you can find
some really important issue in this vale of tears to irritate
the bugs of you.

So, whether or not the tattoo-wearer knows what the symbol means,
someone somewhere is going to misinterpret it.

Of course. And it's seen *exactly* that way by many people.

Native American peoples also used the swastika as a religious symbol.
The Hopis claimed that their wanderings over the North American
continent completed a swastika pattern.

I found a picture of Jacqueline Bouvier (Jacky Kennedy) as a teenager
at summer camp. She was wearing a Native American costume with a
swastika on it.

I don't really have a swastika tattoo, but I knew that suggesting that
I did would inflame certain self-righteous types.

The Nazi party symbol was not the swastika, it was the tilted
hakenkreuz, or &quot;broken cross&quot; emblem, usually in a white circle on a
red armband.

I see nothing inherently wrong with the geometrical symbol of the
tilted hakenkreuz by itself, but by the late 1950's, model airplane
kits began to omit tilted hakenkreuz decals.

There were many films about WW2 in that era and a rising tide of anti-
Nazi and anti-German sentiment.

I realized that I had been brainwashed by Hollywood when I saw an
actor dressed in a WW2 Wehrmacht costume making a telephone call at a
pay phone in Griffith Park.

He was carrying a prop rifle, and wearing a German army helmet.

My gut reaction was, &quot;Oh my gawd, there's a German soldier, I must
kill him before he kills me!&quot;

It was a swastika. However, as I have pointed out, and others have
failed to appreciate, the Nazi emblem &quot;revolved&quot; the other way from the
old Indian symbol. They simply reversed it.

Utter nonsense, at least in Europe. In Germany, however, model kits were
not permitted to carry the swastika as it was a banned symbol (and
remains so. In fact, German model kits *still* don't carry swastika
decals - or they didn't when I was last in a model shop in Germany, two
years ago.

Once again you post self-perceived bullshit as truth.

I'm not sure when the trend began but here in Canada
it's hard to find a WW2 German model aircraft kit with
a swastika on the rudder.

This is alarming in a way, it's like in _1984_ when
the authorities continually re-wrote history to fit
the current ideology.

Strangely enough you can still buy historically accurate
wartime Japanese models, ie. with the red circle emblem.

The PC craze is getting insane. Sometimes Confederate civil

Brainwashed? He was wearing an enemy uniform and your reaction

No, he wasn't wearing an enemy uniform, he was wearing a movie costume
and
hostilities between the Allies and the Axis powers had been over for
35 years when I
felt the irrational urge to kill the poor guy just because he was

&gt; red armband.

&gt; I see nothing inherently wrong with the geometrical symbol of the
&gt; tilted hakenkreuz by itself, but by the late 1950's, model airplane
&gt; kits began to omit tilted hakenkreuz decals.

It's not the symbol that is offensive.  It's what it symbolizes.  My
memory isn't good enough to remember my old models, but I remember my
fourth grade teacher putting me through the wringer when she saw me
drawing the swastika in my notebook.  That was 1962/63, and she was whte
haired even then, which might explain why she had the class learn to
recite Flanders Fields.  The swastika symbolizes Adolf Hitler and the
conservative political party in power in Germany at that time.

No, not really. I never picked on the weaker kids at school, I was
raised to help nurture everybody, especially the handicapped and
retarded kids.

The OP suggested that people learn what symbols mean before having
them inked onto their skin so they wouldn't offend other people. I
have previously studied the meaning of various symbols, but before
those other symbols can be discussed, I felt it would be a good idea
to talk about the most notorious symbol in recent history and discuss
the difference between the tilted hakenkreuz used by the Nazi party
for 20 years and the upright swastika used by other belief systems
over a period of 7000 years.

&quot;In Flander Fields&quot; was already being thought of as a bit trite by the
early 1950's, but veterans were still peddling paper poppies in the
mid 1960's, and trying to shame passersby into donating.

Red poppies grow in European fields in the spring, and larks fly
around singing their song, totally oblivious to any tombstones or
crosses.

In Ecclesiastes 1:4, The Preacher says, &quot;One generation passeth away,
and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.&quot;

The reader of &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; was challenged to &quot;Take up our
quarrel with the foe&quot;, as if The Great War was the battle of the
ordinary man in Canada against the ordinary German, instead of the
battle of kings and czars with interlocking defense treaties.

In an even more popular poem, Wilfred Owen spoke of: &quot;The old Lie;
Dulce et Decorum est Pro patria mori.&quot;

He also died in combat, but not before saying to the world that it was
NOT sweet and fitting to die for one's country.

What most Americans fail to understand was that The Great War was
fought on borrowed money. The Allies and the Triple Entente did not
wish to expend their own national treasure to fight the war, so they
borrowed money from the international bankers and they threw millions
of soldiers into the trenches to win the war, hoping to repay the
bankers from reparations paid by the losers.

The inability of the Germans to pay the reparations led to a new
repayment plan which led to the rise of Adolf Hitlers and his Nazi
party. After the war was over, West Germany finally finished paying
the WWI debt in 1988.

The Nazis were national socialists, they could hardly be called

of all means of production in the country.

The German National Peoples Party was the successor to the
Conservative Party. http://www.answers.com/topic/german-national-people-s-party

A &quot;people's party&quot; is another form of national socialism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Strangely enough you can still buy historically accurate
&gt;&gt;&gt; wartime Japanese models, ie. with the red circle emblem.

&gt;&gt; The Japanese &quot;rising sun&quot; emblem, though, never
&gt;&gt; carried the post-war stigma that the Nazi swastika
&gt;&gt; did.  The plain &quot;red circle&quot; is, in fact, still in use today
&gt;&gt; (see the Japanese flag, neh?), although not the &quot;sun and
&gt;&gt; rays&quot; version of the Japanese wartime flag.  You will
&gt;&gt; not find that version EVER displayed in modern-day
&gt;&gt; Japan.

&gt;&gt; Bob M.

&gt;A quick google of 'origins of the swastika' had a site stating that the
&gt;American 45th Division wore swastika shoulder patches in WW1!

&gt;How quickly things fall from grace........

This is sociology 101.  Look how usage of the word &quot;gay&quot; has changed since

Yes, the internet might be the greatest invention since the printing
press.

I remember my mother correcting me in no certain terms when I told her I
was going to join the army and serve in Vietnam.  That was before I
discovered I was 4F.  I'm trying to decide what prompted me to think the
way I did back then, and I can't entirely discount movies.  I think most
of the brainwashing came from school, but I can't say movies didn't play a
part.  Maybe TV was an influence larger than actual movies.  Cub Scouts?
