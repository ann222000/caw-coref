Jayy - it worked out again!
Pünktchen, the second cat to spay was captured this morning and I
drove her to the vet. This time we were prepared - both of us had
thick leather gloves and it all went well.
Though we watched out like hell, she managed to escape, but we could
catch her immediately and give her the anesthesia. Now she is safely
home and recovering. I am so glad.
The vet told me he would order some sort of cage, where there is a
slide inside, so the cat can be gently pushed against the metal grid
and be anesthesized from outside.
Good trick. I will wait with the other two until he got this cage.

P.S. When the vet operated Murkel, the first one, he found out that
she had  an uterus inflammation, uterus was full of pus. So, if we
hadn`t have her neutered she for sure would have died and nobody would
have known of what.Now, 10 days after surgery she is totally well,
eating a lot and looks really healthy.
All is well.

Well done on getting, Pünktchen, to the vet. Good luck purrs for number
three, I've seen those cages on television, simple but effective.

Breast cancer?  With humans it's the other way round - having a baby
by age 15 and breastfeeding it is close to 100% protective against
breast cancer in later life (not an easy preventive measure to sell
in a modern &quot;developed&quot; society).

My Muriel was spayed and she's got it.  This link suggests there
is no correlation:  &lt; http://www.thensome.com/mammary.htm &gt;

Pyometra is a more serious risk, though.

Thank you Tweed for your encouragement.
Yes, indeed, I do belive in Karma. Furthermore I believe, that INTENT
is a power, not yet measureable, but influencing everything we do.
Do something in good intent and the world gets better. Do something
in
bad intent and the vibes you send out will worsen things.

I thank you that you give me the opportunity to comment on the
trouble
your neighbours are giving you at the time. I read about it in another
thread,
but didn`t comment, as the thread was about something else.

As a house owner myself I went nuts when I read about your neighbours
behaviour. I would need myself people who would hold me back not to
grab
a shotgun and take things in my own hands. Wow, was I mad reading
that.
I hope you will succeed by using the legal ways. I would be happy to
hear how things are running.
Hopefully those new neighbours will sell their property again soon, as
there won`t be
a good neighbourhood relationship after the things they did.
I am so sorry that that happened to you.
And I am so happy to see that you are a real fighter, give them hell,
defend your rights.
(The good intend there could be to help those people realize
that they just CAN`T do what they want to if it involves other peoples
realms.)

Anyway - wish you lots of luck and success

Yes, I know.  I shouldn't have mentioned it there but it was all happening
right then and I was so outraged it just spilled out.

It's funny you should mention a shotgun because at the moment I arrived home
and found my beloved shrubs, plants and bulbs just bulldozed into oblivion I
wished I had one in my hand.  There was not one of those plants that did not
have a sentimental value for me.  All had been given as gifts, some from
people who are no longer alive.
Fortunately our gun laws are very strict here and I don't have one ;-)
So I just wept instead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I hope you will succeed by using the legal ways. I would be happy to

">

After they took down my fence and burnt it, leaving me no privacy or
security they got a serious talking-to by the police.  My neighbour has
drawn up an agreement where they have to replace the plants and the fence
and dig out the 2 feet of subsoil that they have deposited on 15m x 10m of
my land.
They started the fence today, and would you believe it (yes, actually!) they
tried to steal yet a bit more land. Fortunately Jenny-next-door was on the
case and made them take it up again and put it further back.

She believes that they will stick to the &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; we have
signed.  I don't.  They push what is acceptable in the hope they will get
away with it.  They trespass on my new garden all the time, and are actually
using my gypsy caravan to store their tools.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I am so sorry that that happened to you.

They are &quot;building to sell&quot;  At first I was told that &quot;My brother is going
to live here.&quot;  Total bullsh*t.  All they say is bullsh=t.

Tweed,
We continue to send purrs that these jerks receive exactly what they
deserve for what they've done.  It isn't enough to replace your fence
and plants, are they also going to supply the fertilizer, water and
gardening care that it takes for several years for these new plants to
become established? Not to mention the sentimental value.  They owe
you so much more! I'm just glad they don't plan to live there and hope
that whoever does move in appreciates the value of another person's
property more than these people do.

Well, thats a start -  built to sell - an expression new to me.
Obviously means those  people won`t be your neighbours.
I am happy for you there. I know how even little things (like lending
some garden chairs
and getting one back broken) can disturb a neighbourhood
relationship.
So there is a good chance to get decent neighbours.

You know what - if I had the money and the house wouldn`t be too big,
I would love to buy it. I have dreamed for years of moving to the UK.
I even went for searching a house there in 1996. But then there were
the old
quarantine laws in place and I didn`t want to give my cats into 6
month quarantine.

Now, there are better possibilities to bring pets to the UK, but
housing prices went through the roof the last years due to a new law
which prohibits mostly to build new houses, but allows to convert old
houses. A friend told me that some years ago.
I don`t understand what reason might have been the cause for that
stupid law.
In 1996 I might have been able to buy a little one, but now that
prices are threefold
there is no chance for me at the moment.

Could you still sue them after the written agreemant you made with
them?
They should pay for the damage they`ve initiated.

I don`t like to fight either - but if I am challenged I am willing to
get my right.

Oh well - everything could be so nice and quiet if some people would
behave.

Wish you the best

Bettina

&gt;&gt;Thank you Tweed for your encouragement.
&gt;&gt;Yes, indeed, I do belive in Karma. Furthermore I believe, that INTENT
&gt;&gt;is a power, not yet measureable, but influencing everything we do.
&gt;&gt;Do something in good intent and the world gets better. Do something
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;bad intent and the vibes you send out will worsen things.

&gt;&gt;I thank you that you give me the opportunity to comment on the
&gt;&gt;trouble
&gt;&gt;your neighbours are giving you at the time. I read about it in another
&gt;&gt;thread,
&gt;&gt;but didn`t comment, as the thread was about something else.

&gt; Yes, I know.  I shouldn't have mentioned it there but it was all happening
&gt; right then and I was so outraged it just spilled out.

&gt;&gt;As a house owner myself I went nuts when I read about your neighbours
&gt;&gt;behaviour. I would need myself people who would hold me back not to
&gt;&gt;grab
&gt;&gt;a shotgun and take things in my own hands. Wow, was I mad reading
&gt;&gt;that.

&gt; It's funny you should mention a shotgun because at the moment I arrived

I'm wondering.  Since they seem bound and determined to steal a few feet of
your property.

If they don't need a few more feet than they have to meet zoning and code
requirements for what they are building.

If that were the case here and they built too close to the property line,
they would have to tear it back down.  Especially if one of their neighbor's
neighbors complained.

I know I would want to make their lives as miserable and unprofitable as
possible while still getting back what I was owed about now.

Oh like the company that offered me a job running a bargain bookstore,
which turned out to have a plan to sell bargain books upstairs and
porn downstairs?

Now as long as it's consenting adults don't have a problem, seen some
of it and found most of it made me wish for a decent plot..the
funniest one I saw was this one where this girl brought her new
boyfriend round to her house for some sex and her mum and aunt were
there and started making comments along the lines of &quot;You look well
hung after youve sh**ged her, come down, big boy and give us a good
seeing to&quot; and the guy didn't run out screaming?

Sorry I know reality has no place in these things but I just couldn't
believe it after that

Anyway I dared to ask if they had a licence and got told they didn't
need one as all their films were BBFC 18

Within an hour of my asking that they said they didn't think I'd fit
in despite only the day before saying they would consider me for
managing the bookshop since I was well qualified to do that

I later heard they didn't have a licence and didn;t get one. I don't
know the in's and out's but I do know we have a friend who worked for
the department in that council responsible for issuing the relevant
licence...I didn't say a word but I've never liked to ask Dave about
it....

Bettina, you've been misinformed, there never was or has been any such law.
England is small, the population is growing, and so the rules of supply and
demand - plus much lower interest rates allowing people to borrow more
multiples of their salary - are what caused the price explosion. But as
prices vary widely across the country you might still be able to manage
somewhere &quot;unfashionable&quot;. I can't comment on the place and it's no
reflection, but I did hear recently that Beverley in Yorkshire was an
economical place to purchase a house. With a cheap cost of living (property
taxes, food prices, etc.) too. Perhaps Adrian, who lives elsewhere in
Yorkshire, would know more?

Altough we're a nation of animal lovers, allegedly, we could always do with

I don't think it's possible not to!

The new fence has started to be put up today, after 5 weeks of no privacy,

have started from where my security is compromised, i.e. near my house and
worked downwards, down the garden.
No, they started from furthest away and ran out of time to complete it.

Yes, I could and they know it and don't like it. Atm their preferred method

out or in without asking them to move their vehicles.  Time after time. Now
I would say that if someone had been asked once, or twice if they were not

Yes?

&gt; &gt; Now, there are better possibilities to bring pets to the UK, but
&gt; &gt; housing prices went through the roof the last years due to a new law
&gt; &gt; which prohibits mostly to build new houses, but allows to convert old
&gt; &gt; houses. A friend told me that some years ago.

&gt; Bettina, you've been misinformed, there never was or has been any such law.
&gt; England is small, the population is growing, and so the rules of supply and
&gt; demand - plus much lower interest rates allowing people to borrow more
&gt; multiples of their salary - are what caused the price explosion. But as
&gt; prices vary widely across the country you might still be able to manage
&gt; somewhere &quot;unfashionable&quot;. I can't comment on the place and it's no
&gt; reflection, but I did hear recently that Beverley in Yorkshire was an
&gt; economical place to purchase a house. With a cheap cost of living (property
&gt; taxes, food prices, etc.) too. Perhaps Adrian, who lives elsewhere in
&gt; Yorkshire, would know more?

&gt; Altough we're a nation of animal lovers, allegedly, we could always do with
&gt; more Catslaves :)

Hi Gordon,
sorry it took me so long to answer.
Thanks for the information. Well - at the moment it seems rather
impossible to move
someday to the UK. But - one never knows what the future will bring.
It will be a real endeavour to bring all my cats over via the &quot;Pet
Travel Scheme&quot;.
At the moment one has to follow specific routes to bring cats there.
I hope that will change. I`d love to just put them into a car and
drive over.
Anyway - comes money comes move.&lt;g&gt; I felt home when I visited the UK.
A rural place, little house, away from neighbours would be great.
Or, on the edge of a little village. I believe in reincarnation and
when I was in the UK
I really felt that I`ve been there before. Sounds ridiculous maybe.
But is true.

Thanks again

Bettina

Well, yesterday I heard on TV that electricity in the UK is much
cheaper as in Germany. And yes, I know that the living costs in the UK
are higher as in Germany.
But I don`t need much. And a little garden will help. Does it even
here.
Anyway - bringing 7 cats to the Uk seems rather insane at the moment
as the UK
&quot;Pet travelling scheme&quot; involves so much costs.
But the moment I will have (won, inherited, got) enough money to
afford moving and
living there I will go house-hunting. There are jobs for translators
in the UK. I know that.

It is sometimes a shame that we are civilized enough to not negotiate
with a shotgun. &lt;sigh&gt;
Of course it`s not, but hey, the thought of not having to discuss is
sometimes really tempting.

I wish you all the best. And I am very happy that you are not going to
let them their way.

Indeed one doesn't, so don't stop hoping - there are now signs of potential
price drops in the UK housing market (about time too!) :)

I know what you mean about feeling at home somewhere: there's a village in
Brasil that had my name on it when I visited......
