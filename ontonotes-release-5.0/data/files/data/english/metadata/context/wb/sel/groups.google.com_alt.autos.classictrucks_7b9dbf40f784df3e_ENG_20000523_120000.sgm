Hey Everyone,

Maybe you can help me.

Where can I get a HI-Torque Starter Motor for a 57 Chevy 283 V8 1/2 ton Pickup?

Someone in here said that it might help my &quot;hard starting when
engine is hot&quot; problem.

Searching the web I can not find any, except a few special applications,
but not for Chevy's. And they where all about $650.00!!!!

I think regular starters are about 35 to 50 dollars.

How much should a HI-Torque one cost and where
can I get one for a 283?

One of my problems is that when it gets hot, the solenoid sticks
and I have to get out and rap it. Then it turns over but usually does
not start. Once it cools down it starts fine.

Actually I would like a started that turns the engine over faster.
That would be a HI RPM starter wouldn't it?
Does a HI-Torque starter have more
power but turn it slower or will it turn it faster?
It seems that my current starter and my previous ones all
turn it over too slowly.

I am also thinking about a higher output coil as well. It seems like
their is not enough power to spark plugs until you switch from
START to ON and then sometimes it catches and starts as the engine
momentum starts to wind down after releasing pressure on the key.

Any more help out there?

Regards,

Stacey

From What you are discribing, the problem may not be the
starter. Things to try are 1) a heat deflector for the
silonid, 2) a wrap for the starter, 3) and most important
is a new key switch.
A silonid deflector will install on the back two screws of
the silonid and make a wind tunal around the silnoid to help
it cool. A starter wrap is an aluminum shield used mostly
with custom headers. Also you can ad a MSD CDI system to
make the spark hotter from the coil. I used a MSD-6 system
in my '57 car. Works good, and so did the silonid shield
(deflecter).
Hope this helps. Oh! the deflector can be gotten at most
major auto parts for about $12.00 The MSD is in Summit or
Jegs catalogs the cheepest.

"/> When I see an engine starting AFTER the key is released, I start looking at
grounds, battery condition, battery capacity, wire condition, does coil get 12
volts while cranking. Obviously there is insufficient voltage to the coil while
cranking and yes, the starter itself can be bad. It's new, doesn't mean a thing.

"/> Please forgive my not answering precisely the question you asked, but
it sounds to me like either the starter you have is bad or there is
something else going on. If you have any confidence in the
starter--and remember that a bunch of hard starts like you're
describing will burn up the contacts and brushes or melt the
insulation in the field windings--look for bad connections between the
battery and the starter and between the battery and ground. If there
is a significant voltage (half a volt or more) between the &quot;+&quot; post of
the battery and the battery terminal on the starter while you're
trying to start the engine, there is a problem. Same thing if there
is a voltage between the &quot;-&quot; post of the battery and a bolt in the
case of the starter. Vehicles that are old enough to vote, drink,
marry, and otherwise misbehave often have problems with continuity
between body parts because of rust and corrosion. I'd start with
these tests because they're are easy to do and don't involve hauling
money to the parts house. If you have a voltage between the post on
the battery and the starter (or on the other side of the battery to
ground), you're wasting energy that should have been used in the
starter or coil to help you start the car.

Okay, suppose the voltages come out negligible, with the total for
both tests well under a volt.

If the solenoid sticks when it is hot, (1) the solenoid core (the
chunk of iron the magnetic field from the solenoid coil pulls on)
might be binding, (2) the pivot for the fork that goes from the
solenoid to the starter drive to push the drive into mesh with the
flywheel gear might be worn so it is binding, or (3) the starter drive
might be binding on the shaft of the armature. Before you spend a big
pile of money on a high torque starter, you might spend a smaller pile
of money on a standard replacement starter. If one of these three is
the problem, another starter will likely fix it.

If you have a problem getting the engine to start while cranking, the
wire from the &quot;S&quot; terminal of the starter to the &quot;+&quot; terminal of the
coil may be bad. It's supposed to give full battery voltage to the
coil while the starter is engaged, then let go so the resistance wire
to the coil drops the voltage and lets your points last longer. One
way to check would be to make sure this wire is connected (it might
have been left off), then check for continuity from the terminal on
the starter to the terminal on the coil. If that is good, the wire
may still be broken, but hanging by one or two strands, enough to
check good. The next test would be to measure the voltage from the
&quot;+&quot; post on the battery to the terminal on the coil, while someone
tries to start the engine. If there is more than a small fraction of
a volt between them, the wire might be bad or the contact inside the
starter solenoid that is supposed to make this terminal hot when
starting the car may be burned up. Replacing the starter will, of
course, cure the second problem.

If I understand your message, you have replaced this starter at least
once. Though it doesn't happen very often, fortunately, I've had a
bad rebuilt starter or two over the years, so you might try a
different brand or supplier.

Let us know how this turns out.

Hi Stacey,

Nice ride. I'm agreeing with all's been said before me. Not to
confuse you though, I think Ed in the last message meant to measure
voltage drop, not voltage.

You get voltage drop every time the current path runs across some
resistance - like a corroded connection. Easy enough to measure the
voltage drop if you hold the probes of a voltmeter on either side of a
suspected connection whilst someone cranks her up. If the voltmeter
reads 3 volts, for instance, then you've lost 3 volts at that point.
If you had 12v to begin with, now you've got 9.

The starter switch does seem to be at fault, also. Also true what a
previous poster said. One circuit while you're cranking sends 12 volts
directly to the coil for a hot spark. When you let go the key, it goes
to another circuit that runs through a resister to reduce the voltage
to the coil. The coil can't use 12 volts for long - it'll burn up.
That problem may be a broken wire, though.

Getting power to the starter is most likely the problem. Lots of
power! Get bigger battery cables. Go to a welding supply and get some
flexible welding cable. If you connect some #2 or better copper to
that starter it'll wind up like a turbine. Use new terminals on the
new cable. Don't buy new battery cables at Walmart.

Most often overlooked problem in the circuit is the return path. The
metal surface that the starte mounts on is the retune path to the
battery. It's always either rusty or caked with old motor oil/grit.
Pull the starter and clean the metal to metal connection.

Having said all that - I had a GTO in the ol' days and the motor was
worked. Lot's of compression and real hard to start when hot. Usually
just tried to park on a hill and gave her a push when hot. Went through
many starters till and old timer parts man told me about the hi-torque
starter. That starter lasted years, but I still had some hard starting
till I got some serious copper to deliver the volts.

A couple of chime-ins and a source. When I put a rebuilt 390 in my old 68
Ford truck I developed the hot starting problem. Specs called for 8 degree
timing; mechanic friend said try 6 for a while. That helped, but I still
ate three Kragen starters before most of the problem was solved. I too
have looked at the high torque starters. JC Whitney sells one that fits my
truck, probably have one for your car. Course JC Whitney also sells magnets
that are supposed to improve your mileage, so I wouldn't know about the
starter compared to what an electrical shop might have to offer.

There is a complete refresher cource here. I agree with
doing all of the tests mentioned first from the other
messangers, but in my cast it was heat related. The
silonide would work for several weeks and then the problem
would re-accure. That is when someone turned me on to the
silonide shield. The contacts in the rear of the silonide
would collect moister or condensation and start the
electrolicus. Eventually melting down the wiring leading
off toward the balust resister and coil. The heat shield
around the silonide stoped the problem on my car ran with
headers. Your problem can vary to any of the previously
mentioned hints. Do run as many of the formentioned tests
to find where you stand.

OK, I have had a lot of suggestions. I have not tried them all yet.
But as I was trying some I noticed a couple things.

My timing seems to have moved a bit on me and
when I just checked it, it was set at the 6th mark or 12 degrees!

The book says 4 or 8 degrees.
And I am sure I had it set around 8, not sure how
it changed. Well, maybe I moved it once when I was stuck
on the side of the road from the heat problem in an attempt
to get it started and never re-checked it. That is probably it.

One part of the factory service manual says
8 BUTD (what is BUDC is it a typo?)

Another part of the book, in the specifications says
4 BTDC - Before Top Dead Center. I understand that!

So If it was set at 12 and should be 4 than (this is with the
engine at 1000 RPM and Vacuum disconnected),
the engine was too far advanced and some of you
said if it is too far advanced and the engine gets hot
it will be hard to start.

I changed it to something less than 12. First I went to 14
and then I went back past the 12 mark but at that point my
old timing light blew out so I do not know what it is set at yet!
Just my luck! But it seems to start a bit better set at
the current setting. Although It seems to pop a bit
when you release the throttle. Maybe it is too far retarded
now?

I need to get a new light.

And I still have the solenoid stick when it gets hot.
I am going to try a heat shield for it and
clean all the connections to the starter and solenoid.

One last question....
When I took the distributor out and put the Pertronix
points replacement in (about a year ago)
I had a hard time trying to get it back in to line up
where I had marked it. It seems as though it may
be off one tooth. I had made marks on the valve covers
where the nipple on the vacuum advance pointed to
when I had points in it. Where it use to point to 0 degrees
with points it is now at 12 degrees with Pertronix?

Would that be one tooth off?

I do not remember how many teeth there are but it did not seem
like that many, what maybe 16 to 20 or so? I guess if there
were 30 teeth than 1 tooth would be 12 degrees if there really are
360 for a revolution. But I am not sure that the timing degrees
really equates to the total number of degrees in a cycle .

If it was one tooth off would it be able to run as well as it does
when it is running?

It starts great when cold and runs smooth
and sounds fine. Would this be possible if it was one tooth
out of position?

Does it matter if it was one tooth off?
Is it just the timing degrees that matters or is the real
alignment of the distributor important?

Should I try moving it back one tooth or is in not important?

Got to get this thing running reliably.
Once it starts running correctly then I can start thinking about
having some body work done and getting it
repainted.

If you have anymore ideas, send them my way, thanks!

"/> It is possible that it is one tooth off from the factory position, but
in the process of timing it, you rotated the body of the distributor
far enough to line the rotor up with the body. If all the wires reach
(plug wires and wire from the points to the coil), there probably
isn't much of a problem. Usually the wires limit the distance you can
rotate the distributor.

timed faster than 5 BTDC.

Chrysler brought out the reduction gear starter the next year.

Hey guys,

Just had to drop you guys a note to thank you all for
your suggestions and help and let you know
who had the correct answer that fixed the problem!

Ed Matthews and &quot;poor_daddy&quot; both made reference
to the possibility that the wires at the starter and solenoid
might be cracked, grounds may be bad and wires corroded.

So I removed the wires and took the starter off.
I noticed that there was a black wire to the positive pole lead that
went to the ammeter, a violet that went to the key from the S
pole and the R pole was not hooked to anything. Ooops.
There was not any loose wires. I undid some tape around the
wires and found that at one time there was a green wire but
it had broken and was hidden by the tape.

I guess last time I replace the starter I missed this fact and
since it started I figured it was OK. Ooops again.
I should have looked at the book and saved myself a bunch
of headaches.

I reviewed the service manual and it explained that there was
suppose to be a green wire to give Hot Spark to the coil
on starts while it was cranking. Just like you two said.

I ended up cutting it back and splicing a piece in for it and
for the starter S wire. These wires were brittle from 43 years
of use. (I really need to get a new wiring harness and do this whole
truck over befor it burns up!) The ammeter wire was OK and I just cut it
back a bit to get a clean section. I also removed the ground
strap that was hooked to the motor behind the started and put it
the started bolt as shown in the book. I put electrical grease
on all the connections.

Is it OK to splice these wires?
Or should I have tried to replace the whole wire?
Is this going to cause me a problem later by getting to Hot
at the splice or be too much resistance and melt the wire?

Well, now it starts immediately as it is being cranked even without
the choke! That is real nice. I let it get hot idling and it still
started. I also had put a shield on the solenoid. But it still
sticks if the engine gets really hot from sitting and idling with
the hood closed. Once it cools it is OK. This may still be
a problem if I am in traffic or have to wait in line at the dump
of something. I guess I could turn it off now and hope that it
stays cool. I never use to like to shut it off because it would
not start most of the time but it starts gret now.

I will have to start driving it more and see how she holds out.

But the missing green wire was my main problem that I have
been fighting with for so long. Gota have that Hot Spark
resister bypass during crank time. One little wire sure caused
me a lot of trouble.

Thanks again for your help!

I guess I still should check the rotor position with the TDC
to verify that the distributor is not off a tooth as well.
Although it appears to only be off about 10% according to the
timing light and its current position versus the pre Pretronix
postion.so maybe it is just the difference between using the
Pertronix versus Points.

Thanks again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hey Everyone,

&gt; Maybe you can help me.

&gt; Where can I get a HI-Torque Starter Motor for a 57 Chevy 283 V8 1/2 ton Pickup?

&gt; Someone in here said that it might help my &quot;hard starting when
&gt; engine is hot&quot; problem.

&gt; Searching the web I can not find any, except a few special applications,
&gt;but not for Chevy's. And they where all about $650.00!!!!

&gt; I think regular starters are about 35 to 50 dollars.

&gt; How much should a HI-Torque one cost and where
&gt; can I get one for a 283?

&gt; One of my problems is that when it gets hot, the solenoid sticks
&gt; and I have to get out and rap it. Then it turns over but usually does
&gt; not start. Once it cools down it starts fine.

&gt; Actually I would like a started that turns the engine over faster.
&gt; That would be a HI RPM starter wouldn't it?
&gt; Does a HI-Torque starter have more
&gt; power but turn it slower or will it turn it faster?
&gt; It seems that my current starter and my previous ones all
&gt; turn it over too slowly.

&gt; I am also thinking about a higher output coil as well. It seems like
&gt; their is not enough power to spark plugs until you switch from
&gt; START to ON and then sometimes it catches and starts as the engine
&gt; momentum starts to wind down after releasing pressure on the key.

&gt; Any more help out there?

&gt; Regards,

&gt; Stacey

Hi Stacey,

You may be off one tooth on the dist gear. The dist turns at half the
rpm of the crank. If there are 12 teeth on the little dist gear, then
one tooth off = 60 degrees error - not 30 degrees. You can't rotate
the dist body enought to make that up. (I don't remember how many
teeth there actually are.)

The motor runs, so you know the dist isn't in &quot;180 degrees out&quot;. Make
a mark on the aluminum base of the distributor directly below the #1
cylinder spark plug wire. (#1 cyl is driver's side, front.)

Rotate the motor, preferably with a socket &amp; breaker bar on the crank
pulley/vib damper bolt, clockwise, until you get the timing marks to
read TDC. Pull the dist cap - just the cap. If the rotor is pointing
approximately 180 degrees away from the mark you made, turn the motor
one more rev to TDC. Leave the crank at TDC and the rotor should point
to the mark you made on the dist base. If it doesn't, pull the dist
and reinsert it until it does.

Then you know the dist is in right. You still have to time it with a
light.

If the motor is way advanced it will be VERY hard cranking. Once it
starts, though, it'll probably run like a raped date for a while until
the pistons start to burn holes.

possibly on target with something. Would you, please, make a note of
this for my wife?

If it's a good splice (soldered--though some don't like soldered in a
vehicle--or a crimp-on connector with crud-free wires) and the wire
you spliced in is at least as big as the original, it should last a
long time. Your concern about the insulation of the old wiring being
brittle and cracking is valid, and you'll need to watch it, especially
where the wire does any flexing. If the wire is in a bundle of other
wires wrapped with factory tape, it'll likely last a long time, as it
won't get much of a chance to flex.

Many years ago I had a '68 Chrysler with the gear-reduction starter
that wouldn't start hot. The problem began just outside Des Moines on
a summer trip to Florida. My solution for the trip was to raise the
hood any time I had to stop the engine.

When I got back home, I took the starter apart. Turns out there was a
burr on the armature shaft and it was chewing up the bronze bushing,
so the heat-expanded armature would drag against the field poles. That
was back in the good old days when you could buy starter pieces
cheaper than you could buy a lifetime warranted starter.

Stacy,
Summit Racing, Jegs, etc. all make high torque starters for s/b chevys. They
are a gear reduction starter and run from around $150 to $350 depending on what
you are looking for. Thats not your problem, you just need a good
starter/solenoid rebuild or wires to same corrected. Check starter draw vs
specs with amp/ohm meter, that will give you the answer. Hope this helps.

Thanks for everyones suggestions.
You can see an explanation of what
fixed the problem at the bottom.

"/> It ended up that the green wire that goes to the &quot;R&quot; pole (I think it was R)
had been severed and was hidden under tape about 3 inches back.
When I changed the starter out a year ago I did not notice it and
just hooked everything up the same way without the green wire since
I did not see it.

I looked at the service book and listen to some of the other posters
and saw that the green wire supplies a cranking bypass to the
coil so that it will give a hot spark during the crank.

Once I spliced a new wire onto it then my startng problems
were gone. It starts in the crank position guite quickly.

If I let the engine get real hot while sitting then the starter gets
hot and the selonoid sticks (even with a shield on the
selonoid). I have not tried putting a shield on the starter yet.
But I think if I do not let it get so hot and just shut it off if I am
going to ge stopped for a while I will ge OK. Before I did
not dare shut it off as it was too hard to start.
