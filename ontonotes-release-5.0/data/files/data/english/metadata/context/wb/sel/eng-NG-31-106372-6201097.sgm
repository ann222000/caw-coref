My mom died several years back, and at the time I was so upset that I
didn't get too involved.  Now that the dust has settled and there's
some distance from the event, several questions have emerged in my
mind.

1.) I never got a copy of the will.  She was a California resident.
How can I get a copy of the will?

2.) Once I get a copy of the will, how can I assess whether it was
properly executed and be certain I was fairly included?

These questions assume that your mother died leaving a will and also
an estate and, if so, that whoever she named as executor or other
fiduciary at the time and others then interested in her estate acted
in accordance with what her will directed.

Also - at least unless explained further with more facts about your
and your mother's relationship and about her estate - your apparent
assumption that you had to be or even that you should have been
"fairly included" is likely to be at best meaningless if you relatedly
believe that there is some sort of obligation generally imposed by law
that a parent "include" a child in the sense of providing in his or
her will or functionally equivalent other estate disposing of
instrument some benefit for a child.

If a deceased did die leaving a will, the usually least inefficient
way to get a copy is to ask the persons who based on the facts one
knows about the deceased most probably have one - e.g., surviving
children and other family members, close friends, the deceased's
estate's lawyer, etc.

Failing this, if there was a will probated in Calif. in other than
"small estate" manner, a copy would be findable in the branch of the
superior court in the county in which the deceased had been
permanently residing at the time of death and, even if "small estate"
procedures were used, the facts about the will often are similarly
findable.

Bear in mind, too, however, that perhaps comparatively more so than
residents of other states which don't have similar laws encouraging
this, many Calif. residents who believe they will die leaving an
estate opt for the comparatively unique Calif. version of trusts (
including what compared with generally prevailing law in most other
jurisdictions are oxymoronically referred to as "self trusteed" ones),
which, if done carefully/efficiently and otherwise properly, do not
require filing in any court.

The way to assess the extent if at all to which one has been provided
for in a will and whether a will was properly executed is to read it.

Given your "several years back" comment, note, too, that are important
differences both of substance and of timing - in particular, whether
and, if so, when it will have become too late to make a claim to all
or a portion of a deceased's estate - between a person named
individually as a beneficiary or because he or she is a member of some
identified class of beneficiaries named in a will who is not given a
copy of the will by whoever is administering the estate and someone -
even if a child of the deceased - not provided for by (perhaps because
simply omitted from mention in) a will.

Sorry to hear about your loss.

You leave many more questions unanswered than you ask.  Have you heard
_nothing_ from anyone, in all these years, about your Mom's Will?
Generally, a legitimate child of the decedent is entitled to receive
at least an initial notice of probate proceedings getting underway,
but many states allow such "interested persons" to sign a paper
waiving the right to receive any further notices from the probate
court.  Are you _sure_ you never signed any such papers?

If you really didn't receive any notice at all, 2 likely possibilities
spring to mind:

(1) your Mom planned her estate so that, as of her date of death, she
did not actually own any property that would have had to pass through
probate.   In that case, her Will (if she had one) would never have to
be probated or made public in any way, since there was no property to
pass under the Will.  For instance, she could have executed a Deed
while still alive giving an undivided joint interest with right of
survivorship (JTWROS) to someonie else as to some or all of her
property (house, bank accounts, etc.), or could have placed it in a
living trust.

(2) you were defrauded.   IMO, option (1) is far more likely.  But to
make sure it wasn't option (2), you should at least inquire further to
find out what you can.

Wills are supposed to be probated in the County where your Mom
"resided" when she died.   That may or may not be the same county she
died in, e.g. if she was at an out-of-county hospice or nursing home,
frex.   If in doubt, check all of the possible counties.   You want to
contact the Clerk of the general trial-level State Court (whatever it
is called where you live: IIRC in CA it is the Superior Court) and
find out which sub-office in that Court handles Wills.   If your Mom's
Will has been submitted to probate, it will be a public document, and
you can get a copy from the appropriate Court Clerk.

If the Will was never submitted to probate, your options are more
limited.  Use whatever information and contacts you _do_ know about to
ask more questions and find out more.  That's about all any of us can
tell you on the skeletal facts you provided in your post.   Do you
know who your Mom's attorney was who drafted the Will?   What other
relatives might have had a role in executing the Will?   Talk to them,
for pete's sake.   OTOH, if you are estranged from your family, it
could be that keeping you in the dark is exactly what they want.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Trust me, you probably weren't "included" or you would have heard
something about it by now.   And "fair" is in the eye of the testator:
your Mom had every right to leave all her property to her _other_
favorite child, OR to a charity, OR to her cat Fluffy.   What you want
to find out is, IF in fact you were included, did you get everything
that the Will says was coming to you?   If the answer to that is not
obvious to you after you get ahold of a copy of the Will and find out
what happened in probate (if anything), maybe you should call around
and make an appointment with a local will-and-probate lawyer to see if
they can help you further.  Good luck,

Have you considered asking the executor?  Do you know who that is?
Your father?  Your mother's bank's trust department?

First, read it.  Maybe you need the advise of a lawyer here, but
first just read it yourself.  If you were supposed to get a fixed
amount or fixed list of items, did you get those?  Assuming you are
included at all, you have the right to ask for an accounting of the
division of the estate.  For example, if you're supposed to get
one-third of the whole estate, it might end up that A gets the car
and some of the furniture, B gets the house, and C gets the vacation
home, and all of them get some part of the cash left in the estate
(A perhaps getting more as the car and furniture is not worth as
much as the houses).

If it's a fair division, the executor should be able to demonstrate
that reasonable valuations of things like the car, furniture, and
houses give A, B, and C about equal totals.

Was there a probate?  If so, a copy will be in the court's file.  If
not, the custodian of the will was required to deposit it with the
county clerk within 30 days after your mother died.  That may not have
happened, but it's what is supposed to happen.

If there was a probate, it's probably too late for you to do anything
about it at this point.
