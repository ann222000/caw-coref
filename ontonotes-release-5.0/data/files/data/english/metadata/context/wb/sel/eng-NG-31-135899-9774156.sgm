Gigantic surprise!  Former CEO of Commodore Business
Machines, Jack Tramiel, will be making a rare public appearance!
Yesterday I received a message on the answering machine from
Karen Tucker, CMO/VP of Public Programs for the Computer
History Museum in Mountain View (San Jose area), California.
Here is part of what she said:

... I thought you might be happy to know that the museum is
going to have a celebration of the impact of the Commodore 64
on December 10.  It's kind of a 25th anniversary celebration,
and Jack Tramiel will speak as well as Steve Wozniak and
William C. Lowe, the father of the IBM PC, and Adam Chulaniak
(sp?) who was the Amiga guy at Commodore, and we're still
settling on the moderator.  But I thought that if you are still
part of the Fresno Commodore User Group... that you guys
might want to make the trip down to Mountain View for this
event on December 10.

All day today I've been playing phone tag with Karen in
order to get more details and received another message
saying that the exact title of that night's program is &quot;The
Impact of the Commodore 64: A 25-Year Celebration&quot;.  More
details to come when I find out more.
The Computer History Museum is located at 1401 N.
Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, California 94043.  The
website is http://www.computerhistory.org

I am so there for this event!

Slither back under your rock!  Everyone with half a brain knows that Jack
Tramiel is THE hero of The Personal Computer Revolution.

BTW, Atari would have died sooner than it did had it not been for Jack
Tramiel.  Jack's Atari ST was the only thing keeping Atari alive during it
last couple of years.

It may take a little while for it to find its way onto the internet, but I am

Most likely, he will post a report on the event to Usenet soon after.  I look

If  I met Jack in person I'm not sure what questions I would ask him, as I feel I know everything about his business decisions, even
the unanswered ones. How? By interpreting the history of Commodore and Atari. Of course I could listen to his answers...but
then...I'm not sure I'd trust responses from a man who coined the phrase....

As always, I find it hard to understand how so many can be so

what it's worth.... a C:\     prompt is NOT a smiley face that is

bra either..........but I'll gaurantee you, that people like
Tramiel,Jobs,Woz,and Gates to name a few, have changed the world
FOREVER.

Personally ,  I would LOVE to hear what Jack has to say after all
these years, and even more so, Woz (who seems to be on the list of
guests too ), but I can't make the trip.

Frankly, I could care less about his &quot;troubled past&quot;, as much respect
as I have (and I do) for the trouble of their people. Besides, that is
completely pointless. They were incompetent, unprofessional, greedy,
slimy. And that has nothing to do with being white, brown, black,
blue, yellow, pink, gay, straight, bi, christian, muslim, jew,
atheist, extraterrestrial or whatever.

I'd be throwing tomatoes at a couple of incompetent, unprofessional
greedy jerks who destroyed Atari.  Series after series of seriously
wrong moves, and it was clear to pretty much anyone they were in it
just for a quick buck (actually, as much money as possible).

Oh, and, by the way, I was an Intellivision fan back then :-).

Funny how what to you is the hero of the PCR to me is the culprit of
the decadence of gaming.
I clearly remember (since I was 20/21 at the time) how sad it was that
no more games would come out for my beloved Colecovision, Vectrex,
Intellivision and Atari (in that order, BTW), and everybody all of a
sudden was spending their whole time typing crappy programs from
computer magazines which never worked, or spending hours trying to
trim properly the stupid head of their stupid C64 tape players. Not to
mention loading tape after tape of &quot;games&quot;, 75% of which had NO
playability whatsoever....

Were you there in 1983/4? And by &quot;there&quot; I mean alive and as a
rational being? I was 20/21 and paying very much attention to the
videogaming world.. And I don't mean just inserting coins in Pac-Man
machines...

Jokes aside (well, to a point ;-)], that's my point exactly. Woz and
Gates, they had a vision. The Tramiels were just in it for the money.
And they were scumbags at that, too.

Aside from that. I was in my freshmen year of College when I bought my
Intellivision (Fall of '82), and when I bought the first issue of the
first Italian videogame magazine, Videogiochi.
I loved those years up to '84. I did get a C64 almost right away, and
I admit that it was fun and enthusing and that I did learn a lot of
invaluable skills.
But in terms of home videogaming, that was the darkest of times to me.
New genres had been invented (textual adventures, LOL!), and it was ok
to try and create your own (though I was never able to do anything
with a C64, while I did make a few fun ones with the Intellivision
ECS). I don't think I ever went to the arcades that much as I did
between '84 and '87. As soon as the NES came out in Italy I literally
RAN to the store to buy one. And while playing Super Mario Bros for
the first time I truly felt like pure arcade-style home videogaming
was born again! Horaay for NES!

I only have one question for Tramiel and that's &quot;why&quot;. Why did he
leave Commodore? As far as I know, that hasn't been answered and since
Gould is dead, only Jack Tramiel knows for sure.

So being a holocaust survivor gives him free passage to do what he

He may have been significant for bringing computers to the consumer
class via Commodore, but his travesties with Atari are far more infamous
and reviled.  there are many more people who dislike him, which is part
of why his public appearance are few and not far enough between.

Now on the throwing tomatoes at him, that's both socially unacceptable

here is the best article I can find on the subject:

http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/9260/sword.html

The Earthworld Talsiman is no more, having been melted by the dumbshit
who won it to pay for school.  Do you know what that could bring in
auction today?  He could pay for Harvard for himself and six kids and
still have some jack to spare.  That would have have skimmed the million
dollar mark at least.

The Fireworld Chalice is in protected storage.  Likely someday that one
will go to auction to be sold to a rich collector who will not only pay
handsomely for it but will appreciate its place in gaming history.

The whereabouts of the three other prices are unknown.  It is possible
they were destroyed, but there are rumours that they are also in the
hands of Jack Tramiel.  The strongest rumour is that the grand prize
sword is the one Jack still has.  An interview with Leonard Tramiel
danced around the question of the prizes, and failed to clarify
anything, so there is still strong suspicion that Jack DOES have one or
more of the lost three prizes.

If I could afford to fly out for this appearance of his, it would be to
stand and ask him about those items, and if he has them, how he can keep
them with a clear conscience.

And i am certain he won't justify keeping them just because he is a
holocaust survivor (just to put a dig into Charles Richmond for his
irrelevant comment).

I dunno.  He brought the price of a home computer down enough for a

This thread is crossposted to rec.games.video.classic. On rgvc, Jack
Tramiel is seen as the one who killed off console gaming at Atari,
starting with shelving the 7800 for two years until he found it useful
as a (weak) response to the NES.

Not that I care much either way. After having a Studio II, a 2600, and a
5200, I didn't get another console system until after I started
collecting 2600 games in the mid '90s. Computer-wise, I switched from
TRS-80 to Macintosh in '85, and I made the right choice among the three
68000 systems of the day. I just had a gut feeling that neither the ST
nor the Amiga had a long-term future.

Because notoriously videogaming was born AND flourished on CBM
machines?

Ok, I'll condense all the info you need in some simple steps, so that
you can follow:

1) Atari introduced [Classic] home videogaming to the masses. It was
basically arcade gaming in nature: no adventures, no rpg's (yet).
2) The greedy Tramiel duo destroyed Atari
3) Therefore, the greedy Tramiel duo destroeyd classic videogaming.

4) the home computer phase was a necessary step in the evolution of
computing, and it made it available to the masses.

5) that said, while other gaming genres were born thanks to the HC
revolution, arcade-style gaming pretty much died. Those of us who
loved arcade style games were pretty much cringing inside every time
they loaded a &quot;conversion&quot; on their C64, Spectrum (MSX had better
quality games on cartridge, arguably). Amiga and ST technically
speaking offered better quality graphics and sound that COULD mimic
the arcade, but often lacked at reproducing playability, and
conversions lacked an attention to detail.

6) It wasn't until the advent of Nintendo NES ('87 in Europe) that
pure arcade-style gaming was born again.

Those are my points.

I think it's pretty clear from several sources that the Apple ][ was
actually the poorest seller.  I don't think they ever reached even 2
million units, and that's only if you believe Apple sales figures.  It
was Apple constantly marketing the machine in magazines as &quot;the first&quot;
and &quot;the best selling&quot; computer ever that propagated that myth.  It was
always very expensive and not up to the capabilities of the other
machines released a little later (Atari 400/800, C64, etc.)

The computer show depicted in the TV movie some time back where everyone
flocks to the Apple booth is disputed by Chuck Peddle.   He says
everyone was at that show to get a MOS6502 CPU and the Apple wasn't
running most of the show, since Woz had to manually bootstrap the
computer whenever they showed it to someone.  The PET was $699 or
something with a monitor built in.  The Apple was something like $1299
with no monitor.

The other &quot;dispute&quot; is the lack of computer industry press Apple

One of Jack Tramiel's stated goals was to &quot;Bring computers to the masses, not

even the lower middle class.

&gt;&gt; Were you there in 1983/4? And by &quot;there&quot; I mean alive and as a

&gt;&gt; machines...

&gt;Video games are good for a little fun, much like hula hoops and other toys.
&gt;Computers are useful in the real world.  Being an expert Pac-Man player is
&gt;useless on your resume.  Having computer skills is useful.

LOL! I'm a college prof and I teach medieval and renaissance Italian
lit. so either is useless, so there : ).
[Ok, I'm kidding. I also do applications of technology to
second/foreign language acquisition, so my computer skills are
invaluable to my job. However, it's my videogaming expertise that
makes my life (and also incidentally my language classes) a bit more
fun ;-).

Besides, back in '97-'99 I landed a little side job as a US
correspondent for the (at the time) leading Italian videogame
magazine. So, you see, videogames are NOT useless on a resume`!

Sam, don't act like the stereotype of the computer nerd with no social
skills, no sense of humor and no perception of the difference between
reality and what people write on a silly newsgroup.
A 44-y-o college prof would not throw tomatoes for real, EVEN to jack
scumbag tramiel and his scumbag son.
Can you say &quot;figure of speech&quot;?
Maybe you can. Try.

Some college professors crave media attention almost as much as Brittney
Spears does.  To some professors the headline &quot;College Professor Throws
Rotten Tomatoes at Computer Museum Guest Speaker&quot; might look pretty good.
How was I to know that you are not one of those?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Can you say, &quot;Jack Tramiel is not a scumbag!&quot;
Maybe you can.  Try real hard now...

BTW, if I understand correctly, the management at Atari had put game consoles
on back burner long before Tramiel arrived.  The folks at Atari were already
trying to emulate the success of Commodore by putting everything into
computers.

When Jack arrived at Atari he spearheaded the development of the ST so that
Atari would have something to compete with the new flagship of Commodore, the
Amiga.  Without the ST and Jack's leadership Atari would have folded years
before it did.

Never mind that Commodore stole the Amiga from Atari.  That was not Jack's
fault as it happened _after_ he left Commodore.  Blame Irving Gould.

If Jack can be blamed for the death of Atari, it is not because of anything
he did at Atari.  It would be because he made Commodore, especially the
Commodore 64, so successful before leaving Commodore.

Jack left Commodore because of disagreements with Irving Gould.  Jack Tramiel
was the brains and brawn behind Commodore.  However, Irving Gould was the
money behind Commodore.  Irving owned the company, or at least controlling
interest, so Jack was the one that left.

Jack Tramiel is good.
Irving Gould was evil.

Can you say that?

I was a member of the then largest computer club for high school age
students in the St. Louis area, the Forsythe Computers Computer Club.  I
had access to Apple, Osborne, Heath and for a short time C= PETs.  The
PET line was dropped due to lack of sales.  All the computer mags I read
focused very little on PETs, the computer shows I got to go on club
&quot;field trips&quot; to Chicago and Pensylvania had almost no pressence of
PETs, but Apples and Atari 800's were very present.  The last of these
shows I attended had only one Vic-20, looking sad and unimpressive at
its lone booth.

Here in the Midwest, I saw very little evidence of any major presence of
Commodore.  It wasn't until the retail push of the Vic-20 that the name
took on any significance in the arenas I followed, and I tried to keep
my resources wide back then, long before the advent of the internet, and
before the dawn of BBS networks.

Who still loaths himself for loading one crappy C64 tape after another
in those 3 years of hiatus between the death of consoles and the
resurrection of pure videogaming thanks to the NES...

[OK, Iridium was ok... So was Paradroid... The LucasFilm adventures
were good, but took forever to load on C64 disk drives, and graphics
were weak... Wait, Arkanoid rocked! Slap Fight, on the other hand....
Brrrrrr : )]

You might have been better off.  If the PET was so great, why was it
gone from the landscape by the time the C=64 was becoming a powerhouse,
but the Apple ][ family was still thriving with the //e and //c in those
