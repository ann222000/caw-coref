Angel Animals Story of the Week
August 12, 2007
Visit us at www.angelanimals.net

Dear Friends of Angel Animals,

Welcome to the Angel Animals Story of the Week.

We're back in Obedience Class 101 this week. Due to chaos this summer,
we had to drop out of the second class. It's been so long since our
dog Leaf and we have practiced, that we figured we needed to start
over.

Leaf LOVES it. He needs a t-shirt that proclaims, &quot;Will do anything
for treats.&quot;

One thing that tickles us is how he does the command, &quot;Look at me.&quot; He
wants to make sure we know he is definitely looking at us. He jerks
his head up, widens his eyes, and fixes his gaze on our faces as if to
say, &quot;I'm looking. Got it? I'm looking. Time for a treat.&quot;

It's a lot of fun and as with all our animal companions, Leaf is
teaching us much more than we are teaching him.

This week's Angel Animals Story of the Week is about another black
cocker spaniel named Kayla who had a sixth sense about where home
should be.

Email this newsletter in its entirety to your animal loving friends
and encourage them to sign up for our weekly publication.  They will
be joining a terrific community of thousands of like-minded people
from people around the world.

Animal blessings, Allen &amp; Linda Anderson

STORY OF THE WEEK

KAYLA KNEW BEST
By Kathy Ashmore

My precious Kayla was a black cocker spaniel who went to the Rainbow
Bridge on April 4, 2005. When she was just over one year old, she and
I were living in what I thought was the perfect condo. Nice
neighborhood, beautiful landscaping, the works.

I had been coveting this place for months. When the opportunity arose
to rent this two-story unit, I jumped on it and in we moved. The funny
thing about this place, though, was that Kayla never got
entirely comfortable.

After you've been in a new place for a bit, you (and the fur babies)
start to get used to the routine sounds, such as people coming home,
etc. In this place, Kayla seemed to react to every little sound, even
after we had been there for weeks.

In retrospect, I don't think I ever really settled, either. I rarely
took her for walks past the parking area. We'd go around and around
and hardly ever walk after dark. In addition, I kept a spare leash and
harness hanging on the upstairs bedroom door and always gated the
stairs so she couldn't go downstairs at night.

My vision is pretty poor without my glasses. I tend to panic when I
can't see. A few nights before Thanksgiving, my doorbell rang at two
o'clock in the morning. Kayla started shrieking. The more she barked,
the more panicked I became while I was trying to fetch my glasses.

Then the bell rang again, ramping up our collective angst. Kayla
desperately wanted to charge downstairs, but I forced her back. I
wobbled down the stairs with my knees literally banging together,
while holding on to the phone in one hand and the rail in the other.

I looked through the peephole and saw a man on the porch. He was
clearly lost. I yelled at him to go away and wobbled back up the
stairs where I lay awake. Kayla eventually settled down. But instead
of sleeping in her usual spot, she took her post at the end of the
bed.

About a month later, somewhere in my subconscious, I heard a doorbell
ring next door just after midnight. It still scared the hooey out of
me when my bell rang again. The process was repeated
from the Thanksgiving episode with me terrified, and Kayla yowling and
fighting to get downstairs.

This time I was too scared to even shout through the door. I just
stood there until the person left. But Kayla wouldn't settle down. She
moved to her post at my feet, looking tense and anxious.

Then she started a low, rumbling growl. I went to the guest room to
peep out the window. The man who had been at my door was sitting
outside in his truck. Then he drove away.

Several minutes later Kayla started growling again. Back we went to
the front window. There, the guy sat, this time, in the driveway. This
happened three times. In each instance, Kayla was one-hundred percent
right that the stranger was outside.

I was lying half-propped up in bed, clutching the telephone. My heart
pounded so hard it hurt. Why I never had the sense to actually use the
phone, I'll never know.

Now, Kayla loved to cuddle, but she was very hot-natured and wasn't
always comfortable being draped over, unless she was doing the
draping. But that night, with no warning, Kayla charged up to me from
the foot of the bed.

She nudged her way in-between my arm and my chest and curled up into a
tiny ball, so my chin rested on top of her head. Then she made the
biggest sigh you've ever heard and closed her eyes.

She was telling me that the man was gone and that I could relax. It
was the most obvious thing in the world. I'm positive she was telling
me that everything was finally okay. She never moved a muscle.

I later found out that my neighbor had talked to the &quot;bad man&quot; through
the door. When asked who he was, he shouted, &quot;None of your ******
business!&quot;

A few days later, the people at the end of my building bolted in the
wee hours of the morning. They abandoned most things and didn't even
shut the door behind them. They were dealing drugs out of the condo,
and their customers were banging on the wrong doors.

I broke my own lease not long after that. The first night in our new
home, Kayla was totally relaxed. I then realized that she had been on
pins and needles for nine months.

When I purchased my next two homes, I told the agent that before I
would make a decision, it was mandatory that Kayla had to be allowed
on the property. I haven't been frightened since.

I thought I couldn't love Kayla any more than I did on that night, but
I stilled loved her more every single day for the next thirteen years.

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT:

When has an animal had a sixth sense about a situation that affected
you?

ANGEL ANIMALS QUOTES OF THE WEEK

&quot;I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and
self-contained, I stand and look at them long and long.&quot;
--Walt Whitman

&quot;A cat is a puzzle for which there is no solution.&quot;
--Hazel Nicholson

&quot;Today more than ever before life must be characterized by a sense of
Universal Responsibility, not only nation to nation and human to
human, but also human to other forms of life.&quot;
--His Holiness The Dalai Lama

&quot;My brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless but
it is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending,
touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It
may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be
happier at your side -- a little happier anyway -- and children and
all animals, if you yourself were nobler than you are now.&quot;
--Fyodor Dostoevsky, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

&quot;He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with
men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.&quot;
--Immanuel Kant
