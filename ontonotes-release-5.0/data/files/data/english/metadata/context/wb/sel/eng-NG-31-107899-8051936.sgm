If you were a real professional like Mike and me, you'd listen to what we

You're clearly not much of a professional if you still insist on using this
audio toy alongside real professionals.

The &quot;kit you have&quot; is broken beyond repair.

Well, that was really helpful Robert. I'm so impressed by your
professionalism in owning a later model which I cannot currently
afford. That proves you are better than me.

Clearly it is a waste of time to source and replace this small plastic
part, or measure and re-manufacture it at a 3d shop. I should just
throw the whole machine away - repairing it would be very
unprofessional of me. Why, I was on a HD project last year where the
1st AC plugged in the hard disks at a location with faulty wiring (the
director's home in the Hollywood foothills) and they promptly fried. I
managed to recover the whole project one day and $80 of electronics
parts later, but I see now how amateurish my behavior was.  A 'real
professional' like yourself would have just sneered at their problem.

What is your problem? Do I make you nervous or something?

I guess I missed the first part of this movie (or it was so long ago
that I forgot it) but troll or not, sometimes that's the way it is with
small plastic parts that are pieces of an assembly. I guess you're
talking about a part of the transport assembly. I have a TEAC DA-P20 DAT
with a faulty transport that's useless for anything other than a parts
donor now because TEAC has no parts to repair the transport nor do they
have a complete transport with which to replace the defective one. If
you're able to disassemble the transport and take the failed part to a
shop to have it duplicated, that's great. Go for it. But get a price
first, and consider whether it's really worth putting that much money
into the machine. It might be worth it to you, or it might not.

Well, that's a little different than having a broken or worn mechanical
part for which there's no replacement. If you had to replace the power
supply or a disk drive, there are many alternatives to the original
part. But if it has to look just like so and have a hole hear and a pawl
there and five teeth on the back side, you aren't going to find a
suitable substitute for it at your local electronic parts store.

Thanks. I should have remembered that rather than let an inadequate
loser upset me.

Mike, thanks for your thoughtful observations. I'm just figuring that
with the big number of PD-4's out there, there may be some hope yet.
The part in question is relatively simple, and I'm reasonably
comfortable that it could be replicated on a 3d-printer at relatively
low cost, like maybe $100 or so. Scanning it to build a 3d model
should only require a half day with photoshop and blender. Also, I
have a lead on a repair shop in SF that may be able to handle broken
PD4s but they're not open at the weekends.

As I said originally, the ideal thing would be if someone had the
maintenance manual for the PD-4 with an exploded parts diagram, so
that I could find out what the actual part number is and make it easy
for Fostex to look into.

Since Fostex manufactured a number of different models of TC and non TC DAT
machines in the same time frame as the PD4, one would imagine that the part
you describe is NOT specific to the PD4 but to all of their DAT transport
mechanisms which would lead me to believe there's a very high probability of
one of them being around even if you had to buy a junked non-TC Fostex
machine that sold new for $500 and is now worthless save for parts. My first
call would be to Fostex service or to Rick Cannata at Fostex. While they may
not still service the machines, I can't imagine they won't share some
information with you.

Just send it to any of the standard DAT repair shops.  Eddie Ciletti
does decent work.  You'll find anybody that works on a lot of these will
have some old transports for parts around.

Wait... you own a PD-4, and you don't have the service manual?  By all
means, call Fostex immediately and order the service manual.  You should
have a service manual on file for everything you own, otherwise sooner
or later you're going to be stuck.

I have no idea of that process, but if you understand it and have the
tools, go for it. Make a few while you're at it. Once the machine is
programmed, cranking out parts is cheap.

OK, now THAT qualifies for &quot;non professionalism&quot; criticism. Take it in
during the week. Take a long lunch hour at work. Cut a couple of
classes. Let another doctor do the operation. This is no excuse for
not getting it into the hands of someone who might actually be able to
fix it. But at least call them, tell them what's wrong, what you think
it needs, and find out if they have the parts or think they can fix it
without replacing the part.

I think you'll find that even if you had a part number, they wouldn't
be able to find one for you. But why not call Fostex and ask them?
Generally service manuals to that level aren't published these days
because few independent shops or techs work on gear like this. But if
they have such a drawing, they may be willing to send you a PDF so you
can identify the part.

That's what I'm hoping. i have the service manual for the PD-6

It is a true shame that some equipment is no longer supported. The Swiss and
the older U.S. manufactured gear was supported for a very, very long time.

Probably the Japanese manufacturers are happy to treat their &quot;professional
gear&quot; like a consumer product;  manufacture it till something better shows
up (that will sell) and forget the old stuff.   I suppose we become captives
and have to buy.

They need to re-think this, as future sales may be affected.  If a company
won't support their old gear, their new gear will be old gear shortly  and
past performance is an indication  that their new gear will not be supported
in the future either.

Seems to be a dumb way to run any manufacturing business long term.  Product
recognition is one thing, but after the sale service is just as important. A
good solid reputation is easily lost.

Fostex isn't the only one that should have a &quot;re-think&quot;.

It's called a parts department, it can generate income to the bottom line,
or am I missing something?

I can't remember for sure, but I think the PD4 was introduced in 1995 or 96?
And Fostex stopped accepting them for service about 2 years ago....meaning
about a 10 year run which I don't really think is all that bad of service.
I'm sure it's probably also linked to sales figures for PD-4's which I would
imagine nose-dived to nothing about 4 years ago. I owned a PD2 and two PD4's
in my day and I still have one PD4 I've hung onto which NEVER works. All in
all I feel that Fostex has been pretty good about support for my machines
over the years and they certainly made it clear during routine maintenance
visits when support for both the PD2 and the PD4 was going to end.

The problem is that they are selling mostly to a new breed of people who
_expect_ the constant upgrade chain and _expect_ not to get proper support.
And they are selling into a market that is expanding, so there are new kids
buying new equipment constantly; enough that they don't have to support the
old ones.

Fostex is actually pretty good about parts and support for older gear.  Far
better than Yamaha, for instance.  Sony is interesting... Sony's professional
division actually will support older products, while the consumer division
won't even support current production items.
