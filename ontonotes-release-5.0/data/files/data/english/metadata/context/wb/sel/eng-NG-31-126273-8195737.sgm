All life forms process stimuli to further their genetic survival, but
some have a central nervous system that processes a variety of stimuli
in one place. The advantage of this is being able to &quot;weigh up&quot;
multiple factors from different sources, and reach a decision that can
affect a variety of parts of the body. This allows for more informed
behaviour and adaptability to new environments.

Many brains have specialised areas for dealing with specific kinds of
information, each of which is integrated into the whole system so the
results one specific sense or kind of assessment, can be just one
factor in the overall decision.

Some animals, at least humans and possibly others, can sense and
analyse the different brain-processes themselves. It's an imperfect
and incomplete representation, as are any of our external senses, but
we can recognise and consider our mental-abilities, external senses,
memory, habits, feelings, beliefs, etc, and we can observe how these
things behave.

The front of our brain is dedicated mostly to this meta-awareness -
that is the awareness of our different kinds of awareness - and to
making decisions about it, so that we can decide which ideas are more
likely to be true than others, which feelings are more sensible to act
on than others, etc.

The benefits of this are a further increase in adaptability because it
takes us beyond simply observing and making decisions about the things
around us and allows us to observe and make decisions about the things
we use to make our observations. Because of this we can think
critically, improve our judgements and direct our education.

The tricky part is deciding where and when to direct our critical
faculties. Which decisions, beliefs, ideas should we question and when
do we need to simply act on our best guess at the time.

Still it seems better to have these problems than to not have the
faculties that create them. It allows much more customisation of our
thoughts and behaviour, even if people are not always happy with their
own (and especially with other people's) progress.

&quot;The Swiss Army knife is a flexible tool. Its flexibility is not the
result of having just one tool that is applied to all problems.
Instead, it is a bundle of tools, each well-designed for solving a
different problem - scissors for cutting paper, corkscrew for opening
wine, toothpick for cleaning teeth. Each solves a different problem
well, thereby providing flexible problem solving ability. Similarly,
the human mind does not have just one blunt tool for solving all
problems - and if it did, we would be very limited indeed. Each human
mind contains a large number of programs, each well-designed for
solving a different adaptive problem: choosing a good mate, caring for
children, foraging for food, avoiding predators, navigating a
landscape, forming coalitions, trading, defending one's family against
aggression, and so on. We are flexible problem solvers in part because
our minds contain so many well-engineered tools.&quot;

- - Leda Cosmides
http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/ledainterview.htm

The mind is composed of a large number of mental modules each designed
to solve a specific problem. For example, there is one mechanism for
perceiving three dimensions, another for anger, another for falling in
love. The mind is like a Swiss Army knife; i.e., it has lots of
specialized tools. There is no such thing as general intelligence,
general learning, or any other general ability to solve problems.

http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/463evolpsyIQ.html

...Rather than regarding the mind at birth as a content-free, blank
slate on which are inscribed the skills and values of the culture of
an individual, evolutionary psychology posits the existence of innate
interests, capacities, and tastes, laid down through processes of
natural and sexual selection. Evolutionary psychology replaces the
blank slate as a metaphor for mind with the Swiss army knife: the mind
is a set of tools and capacities specifically adapted to important
tasks and interests.

These acquisitions are adaptations to life in the small hunter-
gatherer bands in which our ancestors lived for 100,000 generations
before civilization as we now understand it began. They include a long
list of universal features of the Stone Age, hunter-gatherer mind: for
example language use according to syntactic rules; kinship systems
with incest avoidance; phobias, e.g. fear of snakes and spiders; child-
nurturing interests; nepotism, the favouring of blood relations; a
sense of justice, fairness, and obligations associated with emotions
of anger and revenge; the capacity to make and use hand tools; status
and rank ordering in human relations; a sense of food purity and
contamination; and so forth (Pinker 1997).

Some of these features are uniform across the human species; others
are statistically related to sex; for instance, females are more
inclined towards an interest in child nurturing and have a greater
ability to remember details in visual experience, while males are more
physically aggressive, and better able to determine directionality and
engage in &quot;map reading.&quot;

Why not ditch that Kantian metaphysical piffle and embrace the
epistemology of reason instead then?

Because when you do, you will find that a $100 difference in the value
of a trade deal between us, does not mean that either of us are going
to be worse off, indeed, there is every evidence to suggest, that,
unless either of us was a masochist, or a socialist who regard any
action of sacrifice as a virture instead of a vice ending eventually
in misery and death, or a crook, then the trade would not likely even
be considered by either of us.

Embracing the epistemology reason, will help you to understand that,
the meaning and the purpose of trade, between man, &quot;human
individuals&quot;, (*human individuals* because only human individuals
exist as entities able to produce and desire goods through the concept
of trade), is, to obtain a value of perceived benefit than our
perception of our cost.

Surely you wouldn't part with $3 for a coffeee unless (a) you could
afford to (b) unless the perceved benefit is greater to both, you and
the provider of the coffee, than each of your costs?

Indeed, that principle would apply all the way down the chain to
grower of the coffee bean, the maker of the machine used to make the
coffee, etc. because if it didn't there would be no coffee beans in
the cafe', unless the cafe owner grew them and manufactured the
machine to make it, of course.

ALL, each piece, of man's knowledge has a context, oh and embracing
the epistemology of reason helps you to understand the meaning of
knowledge being contextual as well.

The ONLY tool worth having in the tool-box called mind, is the tool of
REASON.

Non-contradictory identification and integration of the data provided
by the senses of matter.

NO matter = matters not

There is not such thing as &quot;a problem of reality&quot; without matter.

e.g. 1 + 1 = 2 means NOTHING unless the *WHAT* is identified

1 WHAT + 1 WHAT = 2 WHAT

When did you last just say *I saw 3 today* and not get laughed at?

Indeed. How much of the argument seen here gets anywhere?

There is so much variation from mind to mind, and with any given mind,
performance varies.

The Fins did FMRI brain scans on their most violent prisoners, finding
a constricted neural pathway from the corpus collosum (ie 'reptilian
brain) to the prefrontal lobes. When emotionally excited, the scans
show dramatic reductions in prefrontal lobe activity. Ramachandran
explains that they really do &quot;see red&quot; when excited because they are
running on the reptilian brain which lacks the sophisticated color
processing of the hominids.

Push their hot buttons, make them angry, and they quit thinking. At
best, they are only able to respond with ad hominum and/or one liners
dragged up from memory that need not even be that related to the issue
at hand. That is, of course, unless they have a weapon at hand, in
which case they will blow you away.

This may be the case but you have to start somewhere.
A adder unit and a subtracter unit may share most of
the basic hardware parts but functionally they are
two parts at some higher level.

You talk about these parts requiring some scientific and
conceptual cogency. Well that is exactly what being able
to embody them in a program or hardware does test for.

It is a pity you cannot give a precise functional description
of Skinner's &quot;response units&quot; so we can arrange them in a
hierarchy and see what can be done with them.

This makes intuitive sense as meditation tends to exercise (in a
stress-free way) the parts of your brain that are less active in
people with anger-management problems.

That reminds me of back when I interned with the Head Start program,
and saw the Black mothers smoozing the Jewish social workers, telling
them all the stuff they learned about how to deal with kids... while
ignoring the kids. Soon as the social workers left, it was back to
SOP, letting the kids have at each other while they shared the drama
of their lives with each other. And when these cons get back on the

True, but the very people with the anger management problems have such
noisy sensory inputs that they cannot, in the ordinary way of life (as
opposed to the enforced stillness of a prison cell) meditate.

This has a lot to do with why primitive tribal shamen all around the
world relied on sacred potions to alter the state of consciousness.
Faster and more reliable.

What do you mean by &quot;noisy sensory input&quot;? Are you saying they can't
see or hear properly, like when an analogue tv station has bad
reception and is full of white-noise and snow?

If so I'd be interested to see the evidence of this.

It begins with the walls appearing to breathe, and plain white
surfaces seem to have paisley patterns imposed on them, and the colors
become so intense they seem to phosphoresce, and any patterns there
are, such as wood grain, seems to flow like a river.

This is all from the distortion, like an amp that's been cranked too
high, and now feedback loops begin in the carrier. You wont find any
scientific studies of this cause one of the effects is to ultimately
provide a direct experience of the presence of the divine, which had a
nasty habit of destroying christian faith.

Since so many college freshmen were Christians, this made experiments
impossible. But if you want &quot;evidence&quot;, no problem. go online, and
order an oz of Amanita Muscaria. Abstain from all alcohol a day or so
before the evening you want to perform the experiment. Ugarit shamen
slather the dried mushroom with reindeer tallow, but butter works just
as well. It'll protect the intestinal tract from gastric distress.
(but that wont work if you have any alcohol in your system). Shamen
have used it traditionally on the new &amp; full moons, which gives your
liver time to process the muscarine between rituals.

There have never been any Muscarine addicts. It does not create any
craving. But if you used it often enough, you would not become
addicted, you'd become dead from liver failure.

Start by eating 1 gram of dried shroom for every 20 lb of body weight.
A. Muscaria cannot be grown commercially because of a parasitic, but
harmless attachment it has for tree roots. So, it varies from place to
place, year to year. If after an hour the effect is not satisfactory,
try another 1/5 gram/every 20 lb. By then, you should notice a kind of
halo around all objects, not just the heads of venerated saints. But
that is a clue as to why the halos are there, isnt it. Then you will
notice the eidetic effect of whatever you had stared at, being impose,
in reverse colors like a flashbulb, on any plain surface, rather like
a Mandala. Which is why they use the colors and patterns they do.

In a similar manner the chants, or any repetitive sound will echo in
your head, and again, feedback loops setup so that the sound becomes
deafening like the rise in a feedback amp, but then passes the
tolerable level in a flash to total silence.

As things progress, the stimulus noise level passes the real signal
level, it all becomes white noise, and now your mind moves into the
classic meditative state. There's no place else to go.

I have read of some researchers wanting to look into the effects of
psychedelic drugs again, but the problem of excluding all Christians
from the subject sample is troublesome from a purely scientific
standpoint. Christians would have meditation made illegal as well were
it possible for them to prevent it, but the effort needed to succeed
at mediation exceeds what most people are capable of, so they dont
worry much about it.

Amanita Muscaria would have been banned as well, but the clerics and
elected representatives at the time used so much alcohol they were
convinced it was truly poisonous and didnt bother.

The earliest word I've come across is Tocharian for a person with
&quot;magical skill&quot; is 'wiccassi', the &quot;-si&quot; being the female suffix.
Quite commonly, Tocharians were buried with ephedra.

And altho we know it as the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, I think the archeological
evidence shows that the dollar value of the opium and hashish trade
vastly exceeded that of silk. I am somewhat puzzled however, why it
was that drugs were not introduced much into China until the Brits did
it.

The only reason I can think of is the relatively egalitarian
conditions in what is now Tien Shen province; only after people think
that they have no future do they seek a more intense experience of the
present in drugs.

Course this was not a problem in the traditional shamantic practice,
and besides, the drug use was supervised, not 'recreational'.
