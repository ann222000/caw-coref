Shocker Alarm Briefcase
If you carry large amounts of cash, valuables, or important documents, this
briefcase is a must for you. Its two main functions make for an unbeatable
theft prevention system. It can be left anywhere without worry, for when
it's picked up to 30 degrees out of its horizontal position, without being
disarmed, the briefcase will give a 5 second 85dB warning siren and then
shock the would-be thief with 50,000 volts. A thief may also attempt to
steal your briefcase while you're carrying it. But don't worry. With its
four function remote, you can allow the would-be thief to get well away
from you, up to 300 ft (length of a football field), to avoid confrontation
and then press the remote control key to shock them with 50,000 volts of
power. This product is perfect for jewelers, security guards, armored truck
personnel, bankers, etc. Offered in both a leather briefcase and aluminum
alloy money carrier arrangement.
Features:
Instant remote arming: One push of the remote’s button will instantly arm
the case with 50,000 volts of power.
Audible warning siren: A five second warning siren has been added as a
safety feature.
A stand-by mode that allows the case to be left unattended without carry of
theft.
Remote will control all functions of the case from up to 300 ft away.
Long-lasting rechargeable battery.
Available in a rich leather attaché or an aluminum alloy money carrier.
Programmable combination locks

"/> That's nice until someone claims to innocently mistake your briefcase
for theirs and then sues you for injury when you unleash 50,000 volts
into them.

"/> This seems to me to be on all fours with booby-trapping your
basement to shoot burglars. Burglars have successfully sued
homeowners who rigged up booby traps that caused serious injury.
(Sorry, I don't have cites.)

The warning siren wouldn't make a legal difference: what if the
thief is deaf? Even more, what if the person picking it up is
innocent? They honestly thought it was theirs, they picked it up to
get it away from spilled coffee, etc.
