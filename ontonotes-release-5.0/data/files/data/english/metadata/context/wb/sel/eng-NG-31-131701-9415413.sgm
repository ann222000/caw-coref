Spent the day at my son's father's house. He's got stage 4 kidney cancer. We
spent the day packing up his house. Brian is going into Hospice care at his
sisters house and the doctors are treating his pain; that's all they can do
now. We've got his cats, Rover and Guitar,  as comfortable as they can be
here at my house. My other four cats: Hops, Barley, Adrian and Taz are
wondering who's in Connor's room. Tomorrow, I'll open the door and let them
mingle with the community. I'll make the drive to Doyelstown on Sunday to
let Connor spend the spend the day with his Dad and every weekend from here
on.

Just can't stop crying. Connor's dad has gone from a gregarious 350 pound
man, who sang the blues, to about 150 pounds.  He's grouchy and knows it,
but apologizes at the same time. We'll be lucky to see him make his
birthday, December 15,  and it will be a miracle if he sees Christmas this
year.  My tears flow for Brian, and Connor...

*Big HUG*

Theresa, hang in there.  Life can be so cruel sometimes.  But the polar
nature of human existence seemingly provides us that life lesson we all
need to be reminded of from time to time; to be thankful for all the joy
we can squeeze out of life.  It's gotta be hard on you and especially
your son, but you all will get through it.  In the meantime, I pray that
your ex finds some peace in his final days and as well as being able to
open himself up to feel the love you all are providing him.

Peace,
-JC

Unlike many on this group, Theresa, I've never met you, but you definitely
have my sympathy and virtual hugs.  My mom died of lymphoma five years ago,
and spent the last month or two in hospice care (and I was primary
caregiver).  I hope the family is getting the support, both practical and
emotional, from the hospice people that I had in California.

So very sorry for what you're going through. We are experiencing the same
thing in our family right now with my father-in-law. He's not at that stage
yet but the many treatments tried have not been successful and he's not
doing well. Prayers and thoughts to you and Connor. No easy passage down

I almost missed this thread, what with the recent spam attacks.

Times like this, when we reach out to each other, make it worth wading
through all the fribble-frabble to find the heart of RMGD.

My love to you and your son, and I'll pray for a peaceful transition
for Brian. It hurts so much to lose those we love.

(((Brian)))

&gt; So very sorry for what you're going through. We are experiencing the same

&gt; yet but the many treatments tried have not been successful and he's not
&gt; doing well. Prayers and thoughts to you and Connor. No easy passage down

Thank you all for your words of comfort. This group truly is remarkable.
Even though you cannot heal Brain, you certainly have helped us by &quot;being
there&quot;; someone we can reach out to.

Brian is bravely sailing from what we all know into the unknown. He will
have his son, his father, his brother, his sister, his nieces and nephews,
and his ex-wife to gently guide him as he moves on to where we all will go,
too.

Through your words, we have the strength to face the difficult days ahead.

Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting
To be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side
Shining side

Thank You.

Theresa

Schmoe,

I tried to send you an e-mail, but it was bounced back as
undeliverable. Here's what I tried to send:

Schmoe,

So very sorry to read that your father-in-law is so ill. When reaching
out, we learn others are in the same situation and, thus, we are not
so alone and, therefore, we need each other. I pray for your family as
I pray for mine.

God's Blessings to your wife, her family and you. Giving you a hug
comforts my need for one. Y'all hang in there as well.

Theresa

All who are dealing with grief and loss, especially this time of year,
are in my thoughts, sincerely, I've been there, still there,
2 years after my husband and his father died.  It is the hardest
thing, and support helps incredibly.
I don't know you, but feel like I do, and I care.  Love and
strength....and take it slow.
