You've put your finger on the problem. There is no way whatsoever to
detect black holes. Hawking and other physicists are mainly trying to
figure out if humanity would have time to say a collective "Oh, shit!"
before joining the mathematical point.

It is unlikely that such small black holes even exist. Probably the
smallest black holes found in nature would be stellar mass, which means
they would be a few kilometers across. The risk such an object
introduces to the Solar System is purely a function of its mass, nothing
related to being a black hole. In other words, a rogue star passing
through the Solar System would have essentially the same effect-
disrupting the existing orbits of the planets before passing out again.

It is possible that we could detect an approaching black hole by
measuring orbital perturbations in the outer planets (more precisely, we
definitely could do this, but might not notice the effect). Of course,
there's nothing we could do about it; we don't remotely have the
technology to deflect an object massing several times the Sun!

It's not a nice ending, either, with the Earth being flung out of the
Solar System. It could take months before most people are dead, and
years before everyone is. Barring some odd problems with the Moon (which
would most likely simply be swept right along with the Earth), I doubt
there would be any major effects except for it getting cold (unless we
swung close to the Sun first, in which case the end might be much
faster).

I suspect there isn't enough interstellar matter to produce much

if they are in a binary system, with the companion providing large
amounts of material to the black hole.

It depends on the mass. Since the minimum mass would be around three
times that of the Sun, I imagine you'd get some serious perturbations
when it was still many orbital radii away from a planet. In other words,
pretty far out.

Any BH close enough to be a danger would produce a noticeable gravitational

A reasonable mass black hole would likely be greater than three solar

I doubt it. The gravitational lensing will be no more than it is for a
star. The effect would only be significant close to the surface; our
instruments don't have the ability to resolve a few kilometers thousands
of AU away. The only way it might be noticed would be if the black hole
passed almost directly in front of a star that was being measured
astrometrically- and even that might not be seen as anything other than
an instrument glitch, since it would be brief.

Sure, the chances of it coming in with an inclination of 90° are the
same as it coming in on the ecliptic. In fact, neither is likely. Any
object coming into our Solar System will have an arbitrary inclination
(possible weighted by the shape of the galaxy). But the inclination
doesn't change the fact that a three solar mass object (and it could be
much more) passing anywhere near our Solar System is going to do Bad
Things.

It would only suck in an infinitesimal amount of the mass of the Solar
System- basically, a little dust in its path. In order to directly
damage a planet (or suck some of it in) it would need to virtually
collide with that planet, which is very, very unlikely.

The material in an accretion disk is not in a stable orbit- it is
spiraling into the black hole fairly quickly. You can only have an
accretion disk if there is lots of surrounding matter to feed it. I
don't see that as possible in interstellar space.

That's true. I guess what I was thinking was that it could come in on
any plane, i.e. inclination. But of course, there is only one path that
is at an inclination of 90° and intersects the Sun's poles (two if you
also consider inclination -90°).

A stellar black hole has a mass, say 3-16 solar masses for arguments
sake. The gravitational force of a black hole at distance is no
different than any other mass (such as a star). Interactions (other
that head on collisions) follow Keplerian orbits just like stars,
planets, comets and other bodies.

A small black hole (with event horizon diameter of 25 mm) would
have a mass of about .84 x 10^25 kg or 1.4 earth masses.

If a Kerr black hole is connected to its accretion disk by a
magnetic field, and if the black hole is rotating faster than
the disk, then angular momentum will be transferred to the disk
from the black hole.  This could prolong its lifetime almost
indefinitely, the added energy being radiated by the disk,
and an equilibrium holding.

I don't have figures to hand, but I'll look around.

Nice theory, but the likelihood of actually having a black hole meeting
these carefully tailored conditions seems remote. AFAIK, the only
stellar black holes we've observed are paired with stars. That is, I
don't think any isolated black holes with accretion disks are known. I
think its pretty safe to say that a rogue black hole heading towards us
is going to be pretty black.

Just for fun, I did a back of the envelope calculation. Assuming the
black hole is traveling 20 km/s and sweeps up all the interstellar
matter (1e-21 kg/m^3) across a 10 km cross section, and that it
completely converts the mass to energy, the output will be 1.4e8 J, or
the equivalent of 34 kg TNT per second. In practice, the energy would be
less. I doubt we could detect such an energy source at any appreciable
distance. You'd need a black hole that already had one of these stable
accretion disks before it got launched, and then you'd need it to pump a
lot of its own energy into the disk, but without driving material out of
the disk, which can only collect new material at about 1 microgram per
second. Sounds unlikely to me.

If the disk is in equilibrium it will be a permanent
structure without requiring further accretion.  The
radiant energy comes entirely from angular momentum
transfer from the BH itself.

In order to see if such a disk could form around an
initially "naked" BH merely by gathering up interstellar
matter (although presumably it should have been able to
take along quite a bit of stuff from whence the BH was
first created and ejected), we need figures on the decay

For Greg's idea to work, there can't be any infalling material. The
accretion disk would need to be stable, since there is effectively no
way to replace it while the black hole is in interstellar space. Any
energy being radiated by the disk would have to be derived from the
rotational energy of the black hole.

The idea is that the material enters a dynamic equilibrium
with the radiated energy (due to friction) being replaced by
angular momentum transferred from the BH itself,  so there
is no (or very little) loss of material to the BH.

I don't think so. Reading his paper the thin Keplerian disk coupled by
a weak magnetic field is used as a model to make the task analytically
tractable. I don't see how any relativistic plasma will sit in that
sort of cold frictionless particle Keplerian disk (a la Saturns rings)
in a strong GR turbulent magnetic environment nearest the BH.

Other models seem to favour a toroidal plasma close in to the BH
trapping and trapped in the magnetic field lines with strange things
happening over the poles and at or near the notional cylinder where
the classical magnetic field lines would have to exceed the speed of
light if corotating with the BH (or neutron star). Further out the
consensus appears to be that the accretion disk is geometrically thin
and in the equatorial plane. Numerical relativistic MHD simulations
are being done at present check ADS for detials.

It is certainly true that the spinning magnetic field can generate
radiation and electron positron pairs from the BHs angular momentum -
the idea dates back to Blandford &amp; Znajek. Relativistic jets emitted
from the poles are believed to be one manifestation. One thing that
might make an approaching Kerr BH detectable is that there would be a
characteristic periodic modulation with it spinning that might attract
the attention of deep pulsar searches. And possibly some traces of
radio emission where the relativisitic jets hit the interstellar
medium.

They are thought to be moderately short - there is a lot of friction
in the inner accretion disk orbits.

And a part of the evidence for QSOs and AGNs being powered by
droppping matter into a black hole is that no other method can be
compact enough to explain the observed time variability. As a general
rule of thumb for incoherent emitters if something can change its
output significantly in a couple of days then it has to be physically
smaller than 2 light days across (or relativistically beamed towards
us). Also BHs can conservatively extract ~30% of rest mass energy from
infalling matter compared to the puny 0.1% extracted by nuclear fusion
in stars.

Most practitioners think that quiescent BHs that have scoured their
neighbourhood of gas and dust are then virtually invisible apart from
distorting the background of distant "fixed" stars or causing the odd
one to scintilate briefly through lensing effects (and also through
their gravitational influance on any stars that pass close by). There
are a lot of radio quiet galaxies in the universe today and many more
active ones looking back in time at high red shifts.

Indeed.  The question is whether the rate of replenishment
for a BH wandering through the local interstellar medium
would be sufficient to maintain a visible accretion disk.

Not a chance. I think my earlier calculation gives a reasonable upper
bound estimate for the energy available. The interstellar mass density
of 1e-21 kg/m^3 simply doesn't provide enough material- on the order of
one microgram per second, most of which will not be favorably positioned
to end up in an accretion disk, anyway. Compare that with the tons per
second of flow from a companion star that we see maintaining observed
accretion disks.

As the object got into the Oort cloud, the mass density should rise a
few orders of magnitude. Still nowhere near enough to support an
accretion disk, but possibly enough to produce a detectable thermal or
x-ray signal if we were looking in the right spot. But by then, it's
getting quite close.

But "virgin" interstellar space is about as clean as it's possible to
get. Dust clouds and nebulas don't account for much space- certainly not
around here, where we'd be looking for this hypothetical intruder.

I wouldn't say "not a chance".  Very unlikely at worst :-)

First, without knowing something about the actual time
constants for the decay rate of disk material, it is
not possible to reach a definitive conclusion.

Second, it is not clear to me how the magnetic field of
the BH would influence the efficincy of collection or
the cross section of the collection area for the
travelling BH.  Your estimate, for example, assumed a
collection cross section equal diameter to the event
horizon of the BH.  It's possible that it could be vastly
larger than this.

While such an analysis would be interesting and useful, I think it's
possible to get a pretty good sense for the situation by comparing the
mass gain of the accretion disk of a typical BH in a symbiotic system-
measured in millions or even billions of tons per second- to the
possible mass gain of a BH in interstellar space- measured in grams per
second if we assume a very large attraction cross section.

No matter how far you want to push assumptions, these scenarios are
simply existing in vastly different realms.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Indeed.  The question is whether the rate of replenishment

&gt; &gt; Not a chance. I think my earlier calculation gives a reasonable upper
&gt; &gt; bound estimate for the energy available. The interstellar mass density
&gt; &gt; of 1e-21 kg/m^3 simply doesn't provide enough material- on the order of
&gt; &gt; one microgram per second, most of which will not be favorably positioned
&gt; &gt; to end up in an accretion disk, anyway. Compare that with the tons per
&gt; &gt; second of flow from a companion star that we see maintaining observed
&gt; &gt; accretion disks.

&gt; I wouldn't say &quot;not a chance&quot;.  Very unlikely at worst :-)

&gt; First, without knowing something about the actual time

&gt; not possible to reach a definitive conclusion.

Although never say never this scenario seems extremely unlikely and
would require an unusually fast spinning BH with a very specific
Goldilocks style magnetic field for it to work at all. AFAIK we don't
have a particularly good handle on how strong the magnetic field of a
few solar mass BH is likely to be. neutron stars have pretty extreme
ones though at around 10^10 Gauss or so. A solar mass BH being more
compact still might be even stronger still.

&gt; Second, it is not clear to me how the magnetic field of
&gt; the BH would influence the efficincy of collection or
&gt; the cross section of the collection area for the
&gt; travelling BH.  Your estimate, for example, assumed a
&gt; collection cross section equal diameter to the event
&gt; horizon of the BH.  It's possible that it could be vastly
&gt; larger than this.

Th acpture cross section is unlikely to be much more than an order of
magnitude bigger or at the very most two orders of magnitude bigger
even if you could contrive to make the material in the accretion disk
spin in the opposite sense to the black hole.

&gt; &gt; As the object got into the Oort cloud, the mass density should rise a
&gt; &gt; few orders of magnitude. Still nowhere near enough to support an
&gt; &gt; accretion disk, but possibly enough to produce a detectable thermal or
&gt; &gt; x-ray signal if we were looking in the right spot. But by then, it's
&gt; &gt; getting quite close.

&gt; &gt; &gt;A rogue black hole would not be sitting in a static desert
&gt; &gt; &gt;swept clean of all matter, but rather continuously passing
&gt; &gt; &gt;through 'virgin' territory.

&gt; &gt; But &quot;virgin&quot; interstellar space is about as clean as it's possible to
&gt; &gt; get. Dust clouds and nebulas don't account for much space- certainly not
&gt; &gt; around here, where we'd be looking for this hypothetical intruder.

&gt; Clean but not empty.  Again, I'd like to see figures for the
&gt; time constants involved to see if it is possible to form an
&gt; equilibrium with a maintained, detectable disk.
">

To a very good approximation it is empty. BHs on a starvation diet but
still luminous are reckoned to consume around 10^-15 solar mass per
year ( ~10^15kg) or put another way more than 10^7 kg per second with
something less that 30% efficiency. Compared to the few microgrammes
that a BH in interstellar space can hope muster this is a huge
difference in luminosity.

Although the time constants are not easily available. There are
several papers that claim that magnetic drag is responsible for the
transfer of angular momentum outwards that allows the orbitting
accretion disk to fall into the black hole. There are also
observations of rapid flaring in binary BH systems with accretion
disks where one BH is though to periodically impact on the others
accretion disk at semi-regular intervals. See for example the slightly
garbled report at:
http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_center/discover_0601.html

I haven't checked the original reference to Nature in July last year,
but a popularised summary is online at:
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060621_bhole_magnetic.html

You only have to look at the orbitting material video around the Crab
nebula pulsar to see that life is brutal and short once it is in the
accretion disk. It either goes down the plug hole or gets ejected in
the polar jets and away from the compact object. The best hope for
seeing something coming would probably be when it went through regions
of enhanced density like the bow shock of the heliopause or Kuiper
belt for instance.

And my guess based on what AGN radio galaxies look like is that if it
were detectable it would be by the hot spots where its relativistic
jets impact on the interstellar medium that would be brightest and not
the central engine.

Martin, thanks for your comments.  It's nice to have a
rational conversation on Usenet every now and then.

It looks as though the tide of evidence and theory is
solidly against my proposial, and I can't with good faith
continue to defend it vigorously.  Ah well.  It got me to
thinking at least.

Regarding accretion disks and disks in general, I don't think
that the only possible fate of material in a disk about a
black hole is to be swallowed or ejected via jets.  A lone
black hole in a quiet neighborhood would behave as any other
massive body (such as a star) and could support a ring
system or even have planets coallesce from circling matter.
The 'rough stuff' occurs closer in, where there are no
stable orbits.

I suspect there wouldn't be the right conditions for planets to form.
That is generally assumed to happen in the same process that forms a
star. A black hole is an older system, which has presumably swept its
region clear of most gas and dust. An accretion disk shouldn't be able
to coalesce to planets because of the chaotic environment close to a
pair of large masses. In the case of a black hole, it seems more likely
that outer planets might survive the supernova of the progenitor star
and continue orbiting around the black hole.

A ring system is dynamically possible, but rings are not highly stable
or long-lived. I don't know that there is enough material to build a
ring system after the supernova that created the black hole, and I don't
think a lone black hole can support an accretion disk at all. So where
would the rings come from?

I don't propose any particular scenario, I simply offer that
the gravitational environment of a black hole, outside of the
inner region where spacetime becomes complicated by GR effects,
is no different from the environment of a star with the same
mass.  In other words, just because someone shouts "Black hole!"
does not mean that everything suddenly becomes destructive
chaos.

Perhaps a black hole passing through a dense cloud could trigger
a collapse of part of the cloud into an accretion disk, with
some of it ending up in the planet forming regions?

The same thought was going through my head when I read your previous
post. But, as you point out, a black hole doesn't appear much different
from an ordinary star except very close to its event horizon. So the
question is, do stars passing through dense clouds attract enough
material to form planets? I don't know, but I've never heard of that.

While I very much doubt that even the densest dust clouds are rich
enough to support an accretion disk, I'd expect any such disk to survive
only while the black hole was in the cloud, and then decay rapidly,
leaving no material behind. I think that any material accompanying a
black hole would be more likely to be residue from its earlier life as a
star (and probably many AUs out), not material picked up after it became
a black hole.

Interesting discussion.

My knowledge of this stuff is somewhat dated, but I still know mostly
where to look. The problem I have found is that there is far more on
the supermassive BHs that power radio galaxies and AGNs than on
stellar remnant sized ones. I stumbled upon this presentation that
details a lot of the observational evidence and some key theory for
the former.

http://constellation-x.nasa.gov/documents/resources/presentations/AAS...

(caution this is a *large* file about 6MB and it assumes at least
first degree physics)

The closest I have found for stellar mass BHs is
http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/blackholes_stellar3.html
(and it is not very good)

One thing that isn't clear to me from what I have been able to find is
whether or not the stellar remnant black holes have even higher
magnetic fields than pulsars. Or whether the magnetic field is allowed
to dissipate by the relatively high surface impedance of a newly
formed BH. There are still only a handful of candidate objects mostly
in binary systems being fed by their neighbours stellar envelope. I'd
like to know how strong their putative magnetic fields are but have so
far failed to find any comparable general discussion of the stellar
mass BHs theory and evidence.

It can also end up in a thermal hot gas atmosphere around the central
engine. The inner workings have proved very difficult to probe since
few wavelengths will penetrate that far. Xray images and spectra offer
the most promise.

For a maximally spinning Kerr metric BH the innermost stable circular
orbit is at the event horizon (if going in the same sense as the spin
of the BH), but for a retrograde orbit it is at 9Rs. The inner region
is going to be pretty hairy but for regions well away from the strong
GR and magnetic influence it is just a gravitating mass.

I have also stumbled upon an abstract that summarises what an isolated
BH may look like based on current theories
