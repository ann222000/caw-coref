&gt;&gt; OK, thanks.  So this is true in all configurations, or only during
&gt;&gt; certain phases of flight like an approach?

&gt; Very few things are true in all configurations.  Every time you want to
&gt; change an aircraft's configuration, you are adjusting a fine balance between
&gt; pitch and power.  Usually, what you're seeking is stability.  In general, a
&gt; more lasting, stable outcome will be achieved if you think of altitude
&gt; change in terms of power, and airspeed change in terms of pitch.

As we say in the software engineering biz:  Everything is deeply
intertwingled.

I actually worked with a group of human engineering experts at an
Army lab that designed a fly-by-wire helicopter control which
decoupled all the interactions between the controls (essentially
the collective just made you go up and down, the cyclic translated
you and the pedals spun you).  It made the real helicopter pilots
a bit unnerved when they flew it as they were used to putting
in the compensations.

By the way, this intertwingling nature is largely poorly implemented
in PC games.

&gt;&gt; When setting up in cruise, do not drive the plane like most people drive a
&gt;&gt; car.  You should start with a preplanned setting in mind:  &quot;I am going to
&gt;&gt; cruise at 2200 rpm and 21 inches&quot;.  After you attain your altitude and
&gt;&gt; reduce to this power setting, you would then gradually trim the airplane so
&gt;&gt; it is flying level at that setting.  Your speed will be what it is, plus or
&gt;&gt; minus a few knots indicated.

&gt; Is maintaining a specific altitude important under VFR, or is it okay
&gt; to drift over a broad range?  I admit that I don't necessarily see a
&gt; compelling reason to fly at 6000 rather than 4000 (or vice versa) in
&gt; most cases, or anywhere in between.

Unless you are within 3000 feet of the ground you shouldn't be at
either altitude VFR.  Try reading some of the books we recommended
to you.

Generally, if you were a real pilot, you'd be required to demostrate
control to within 100'.

The part like flying a REAL PLANE.
