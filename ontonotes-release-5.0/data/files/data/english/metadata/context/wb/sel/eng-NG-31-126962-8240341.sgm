Hmmmm... Navy SEALs...

Yo! Did Mr. Pillock ever get a straight answer regarding Ray Haddad's
Special Ops experience while still an E-5 in the US Navy?

APRIL 8 2007

Ray Haddad:   &quot;Every word I have written about my service time
has been absolute fact.&quot;

Mr. Pillock:  &quot;Really. Have you heard of the term, 'valor thief,'
Ray? [...]   Let's start with your combat
experience. You were in the Navy, right? And
you claimed to have 'stared in the eyes' of
someone who was trying to kill you.

&quot;That's commando stuff, isn't it, Ray? You
were in the Navy, not the Marines. And
you did up-close fighting in Vietnam. That adds
up to you claiming to have been a part-time
SEAL, I reckon.

&quot;Ray, who was your swim-buddy?&quot;

Ray Haddad:   &quot;Check your e-mail.&quot;

Mr. Hope:   &quot;I'm getting the scent of weasel on the wind.&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;The SEAL teams experienced this war like no others.
Combat with the VC was very close and personnel. Unlike
the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into
a coordinate location, or dropping bombs from thirty
thousand feet, the SEALs operated within inches of their
targets. SEALs had to kill at short range and respond
without hesitation or be killed themselves.&quot;  [1]

&lt;comparing to some of Ray Haddad's claims&gt;

Yup, Mr. Pillock is correct. He's claimin' Special Ops duties, no doubt.
Cool, 'cause the list of Navy SEALs *is*, most definitely, complete, and
confirmation is easily available and free to the public. Then again,
mebbe Sailor Ray Haddad, who was... &lt;checking notes&gt;  an E-5  at the
time, was only a kinda sorta SEAL... like, he was on a two year exchange
program durin' which he went In Country to fight, and a trained Navy
SEAL took Haddad's place as a ship's Aviation Electronics Technician 3rd
Class. Nice of Ray Haddad to give the poor SEAL a break from stuff like:

&quot;I can assure you that unless you have looked into the eyes
of a man wanting to kill you, you don't know the meaning of
the word combat. [...]  But you can't really feel the deep
seated tightness and heightened state of your senses until
you have been there.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, E-5 SAILOR, claims superiority
in Military Knowledge Based on his Direct,
Eye to Eye Combat Duty

&quot;A significant difference between you and me is that I
mourn both sides in their death and grieving. As a US
Military man with two years (yes 2 calendar years) of
TOTAL TIME in COMBAT ZONES in DIRECT COMBAT,
I mourned every enemy soldier WHO DIED BECAUSE
OF MY ACTIONS actions and prayed for their immortal
souls as fervently as I did for any of my own who had fallen.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad: an E-5 SAILOR with two years of
Direct Combat Duty, during which he grieved
for *every* SOLDIER he PERSONALLY KILLED

&quot;I never have lost one minute of sleep over things I did
in Vietnam. I experience no flashbacks, no tearful soul
searching and certainly NO REGRETS for DOING WHAT
I HAD TO DO to REMAIN ALIVE.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, Vietnam War COMBAT Veteran :
Grieving for every soldier he killed while
In Country during the Vietnam War?
OK, maybe *not* so much.

&quot;I fought a real enemy in a real war and had real SNIPERS
SHOOTING AT ME at me. I survived and many of them didn't.
For your sake, leave it at that. I'd hate to see you getting
into a lather over my combat record. What war were you in, Alan?&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, an E-5 SAILOR, claims
superiority in Military Knowledge Based on
Having Killed Snipers (specifically, just the
snipers that shot at people, not the ones
that didn't) . Also claims kindness in sparing
Mr. Hope further Particulars (what a guy!).

&quot;Have you any idea of how hard it is to kill someone who is
actively involved in trying to kill you? For MANY OF US
over there, those choices stung EACH TIME they were made.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, an E-5 SAILOR, claims
superiority in Military Knowledge Based on his
years experience &quot;over there&quot; in the hard job
of killing an individual enemy soldier who is
(no, really) &quot;actively involved in trying to kill&quot; him.

&quot;That's easy for me to answer. I've stared death in the
face and I'm still here.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad, an E-5 SAILOR, claims superiority
in Military Knowledge Based on his Direct, Face to Face,
Inches-From-the-Enemy Combat Duty

&quot;I'm retired from killing now, Geno. I haven't
taken a life in over 30 years now.&quot;

--  Ray Haddad,an E-5 SAILOR, has not killed
anyone *since* engaged in Direct, Face to Face,
Inches-From-the-Enemy Combat Duty in Vietnam

So what? I can assure you that unless you have looked into the eyes of
a man wanting to kill you, you don't know the meaning of the word
combat. You can understand it, certainly. You can even discuss it with
great authority by imagining what it would be like. But you can't

senses until you have been there.

It's a lie, as everyone but the dimwit Josh already knows. They also
know you'll never provide any FOIA reply, as you never filed the

hasn't it? They get real upset that you made them

Except for one minor detail. I never made any such claim.. . .

*Your* words are lies, Ray. Your claim of a 1974 bombing campaign over
Hanoi, alone, condemns you as a liar. It never happened. You were never
a part of something that never happened. You've had more than ample
opportunity to fess up or even claim to have misremembered dates or to

I mourned every enemy soldier WHO DIED BECAUSE

Here's you lecturing on how *you're* the one that knows what it is to
fight in eye-to-eye combat:

of  'You have too much spittle all over your monitor at the

&quot;And then, when you're confronted with the evidence, rather
than saying 'You were right, sorry for the slur,' you refuse
to acknowledge it. You weasel in a painfully obvious way.

Never claimed to be a Seal, Sylvia. You made that up along with lots

&gt;   &quot;A significant difference between you and me is that I
&gt;    mourn both sides in their death and grieving. As a US
&gt;    Military man with two years (yes 2 calendar years) of

Sylvia, I'll make a statement.
Many times the ships (Cruisers and Destroyers) came in so close
that they hit bottom so they could lob rounds/shells further inland or to
hit the backside of hills or mountains.

A lot or some of the times VC beach guns would shoot at the ships and
come very close to hitting them. A lot of captains only came in close one
time and said never again. Yes you could see the VC on the beach shooting at
you and if you had some good &quot;binos&quot; (binocular) you could see there faces
and eyes.

Also if he was on an aircraft carrier the planes did bring back some
very good and close-up pictures. I also recall something about flying
downtown a few times until the U.S. stopped the bombing of Hanoi!

These things are facts, I don't know dates. I have friends who are Flag
Officers that have told me stories about these things.

In fact, one might say that... Haddad dropped the ball.

I crack me up!

A much better &quot;Navy SEALs: serious to funny&quot; exchange:

SUBJECT:  Navy Seals vs. Army Rangers
Apr 24 (One (1) day after my BIRTHDAY!) 2003

Mr. Pinnel:  &quot;Rangers are assault troops.  Their job is to
destroy things, not rescue hostages.  Likely
the SEALS were The Naval Special Warfare
Development Group boys, who specialize in
anti-terrorist stuff and hostage rescue.&quot;

Mr. Cougar:  &quot;Correct, and the Air Force's Para Rescue are
there to rescue down airmen, among others, while
their Combat Controllers are there to take control
of airports, etc. However, due to their training,
more complex and thorough than any other special
force units, they make damn fine all purpose
combat units.&quot;

Mr. Stan:  &quot;SEAL training is the toughest of all, bar none.
If you doubt me, you just try playing Three Blind
Mice on a set of those stupid horns while you're
balancing a beach ball on your nose.

&quot;No cake-walk, lemme tell you.&quot;

Mr. Cougar:  &quot;Tell that to the SEAL members who then joined
the Air Force Special Ops. THEY are the toughest
trained, bar none.&quot;

Mr. Stan:  &quot;Air Force?! SEALS in the Air Force?!
Flying SEALS?! I mean, how fast would
they have to flap them flippers?&quot;

Yeah, sure, Burr. Runnin' a ship aground has been a long standing naval

* * * RAY HADDAD:  Vietnam Combat Zone Adventures * * *

&quot;One morning in Vietnam during the big war (WW Nam), I was
sitting at a rickety table having a coffee chatting with a civilian
(an actress/singer) from the world of entertainment and a few
local troops, one of whom was a Chaplain. The discussion revolved
around the subject of incoming mortar rounds [...]

&quot;The best option was to keep on doing whatever you were doing
but if it made you feel better, go and hide. The actress nearly
jumped out of her silk bathrobe when a moment later the
dreaded cry of &quot;Incoming!&quot; was issued.  [...]  no snickering or
laughing at her reaction occurred until later. &quot;

Because you wrote all that, Haddad. Because, along with Joshua P. Hill

Combat with the VC was very close and personnel. Unlike

without hesitation or be killed themselves.&quot;

Ray,

First of all, I can't believe you guys (that's everyone, not just Ray)
are still going on, and on, about all of this.

A comment, and then a question . . . . .

There was no 1974 bombing of Hanoi. That is a fact. It can never be
proven, because it never happened. My guess is that you got the dates
mixed up, and for some reason, have not chosen to admit it.

Below, you say &quot;But, I did have a job that took me in-country and into
combat.&quot;

I don't doubt that could be true. Even if you consider being &quot;in
combat&quot; in a more liberal way than most. I'm not saying that is the
case, though.

What was your job in-country?

Doug Reese

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many times the ships (Cruisers and Destroyers) came in so close

&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, Burr. Runnin' a ship aground has been a long standing naval
&gt;&gt; technique for gaining a firm base from which to &quot;lob rounds/shells&quot;.

&gt;&gt; So, when they were done, did the ship's crew get out and push their
&gt;&gt; ships back out to deeper water? If that wasn't enough, could they call
&gt;&gt; Time Out and ask the VC to help?

Greetings from Saigon

I replied to this yesterday, but don't see it. Google has been having
trouble for a day or two, maybe that's it. Anyway, I said something
like this , , , , , ,

I can't believe you guys are still going on about this.

First of all, my guess is that Ray just got his dates wrong on the
bombing Hanoi in 1974 thing. It flat out didn't happen, and I can't
imagine someone making up such an outrageous story that can't possibly
be proven.

I am curious, Ray, as to what you did that took you into combat. It
certainly is possible, especially if one is being liberal as to the
definition of combat. Liberal or not, the Navy certainly did have guys
who were in combat. PBRs and Swift Boats come to mind, and I'm sure
there's more than that. Seals weren't the only Navy people to see
combat in Vietnam.

You may have stated this earlier, Ray, but I haven't seen the answer.
What did you do in Vietnam that was combat-related?

No one saw Stan dancing in a gold thong, nor was Stan drunk when he
donned the thong -- over his clothing -- at the insistence of pretty
much everyone there.  It did not take drink to lower his resistance,
if he even had resistance.  It took having an audience.  Stan likes
people.  People like Stan.  We all like a good time.

Perhaps in your circles, Ray, people must have booze to have a good
time, and that's why you would ascribe drunkenness to someone who
likes to make people smile?

Have you gone completely crazy, Haddad? Or, are you working on a plea?

No, Haddad, all of what you wrote, all baseless lies, is out of a
common, very common,  compilation of your and Fundoc/Steve's and Joshua
P. Hill's pitiful and twisted versions of &quot;imagination&quot;.

You'd have to cite the dark and slimy recesses of your mind.

&quot;Josh, Dishonesty about service or LACK THEREOF in Vietnam
has always been a very touchy issue among veterans of that
war. There are even groups who set out to discredit those
who lie about their service in Vietnam; FAMOUS OR NOT.
It's not just Kerry who is or has felt the sting. [...] his lies
about [...] Vietnam and now IT'S  TIME  to  PAY  THE  PIPER.&quot;

-- RAY HADDAD scolds Joshua P. Hill for supporting
John Kerry's claims about military service
because &quot;Kerry was a liar and a fraud&quot;.
(&quot;Get over it. Nobody smeared him. They
told the truth about the liar.&quot;)

&quot;Have you heard of the term, 'valor thief,' Ray? [...]
it seems there are people out there who specialise
in outing fake Vietnam vets. They LIKE doing it, Ray.
Shall I contact them, and let them know what you've
been claiming, where you've been claiming it, etc?&quot;

Greetings from Saigon

I replied to this yesterday (twice), but don't see them. Google has
been having trouble for a day or two, maybe that's it. Anyway, I said
something like this , , , , , ,

I can't believe you guys are still going on about this.

First of all, my guess is that Ray just got his dates wrong on the
bombing Hanoi in 1974 thing. It flat out didn't happen, and I can't
imagine someone making up such an outrageous story that can't possibly
be proven.

I am curious, Ray, as to what you did that took you into combat. It
certainly is possible, especially if one is being liberal as to the
definition of combat. Liberal or not, the Navy certainly did have guys
who were in combat. PBRs and Swift Boats come to mind, and I'm sure
there's more than that. Seals weren't the only Navy people to see
combat in Vietnam.

You may have stated this earlier, Ray, but I haven't seen the answer.
What did you do in Vietnam that was combat-related?

&gt; &gt;Well, then, Haddad, you'll have no problem with my askin' (Real) Navy

&gt; &gt;group did he claim to be in?&quot;, you won't mind if I ask VeriSEAL what
&gt; &gt;group you were with. Good. Glad we got that settled.

&gt; Except for one minor detail. I never made any such claim.. . .

&gt; Sylvia, you tried to created a huge lie here, assigned it to me and
&gt; now you want to pass it on to someone else. Guess what? It won't
&gt; work. I wasn't a Navy Seal. Never claimed to be. But, I did have a
&gt; job that took me in-country and into combat. So, guess again. Keep
&gt; on trying.

&gt; Now, about that answer to your howling accusation of my being a
&gt; so-called &quot;valor thief.&quot; Yes or no, Sylvia? Which is it?

He's been given ample opportunity to correct any mistake. He's remained
adamant that he was involved in an extended 1974 Hanoi bombing campaign.
Only one idiot has been stupid enough to give that moronic lie any
credibility, and that based on a few hours meeting that he thinks gives
him some astonishing insight about Ray.

Good luck on this one. He's not going to give any more information that
can be verified.

Interestingly, he plays coy when asked direct questions such as yours,
refusing to supply any proof, as though he doesn't care if anyone
believes him or not. Then OTOH, he claims to have fired off a FOIA
request and a request for copies of the USS Ranger logs in order to
prove his ludicrous claims re the '74 Hanoi bombing campaign. He's too
stupid to see the contradiction.

Betcha he's already emailed you in an attempt to get you to stay out of
this.
