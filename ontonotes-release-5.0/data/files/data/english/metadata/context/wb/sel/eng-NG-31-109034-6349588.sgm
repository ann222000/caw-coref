WI the Russian American Company had joined with Scheffer to create the
Pacific Triangular trade that later did evolve. Sandalwood from
Hawaii, Sea Otter fur from Alaska and Hawaii in return for china and
tea. Fort Ross was established in 1812 on a windswept portion of the
California coast to grow food for Alaska. A better site was just south
at Bodega Bay. Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov had laid the ground
work for Russian-Californio cooperation with his voyage of 1806, and
his founding of the Great Russian American Fur Company. When he
subsequently died in 1807 the way was open for a Russian to follow up
on his earlier friendship with the alcalde of San Francisco,Don José
Darío Argüello.

In the same vein George Scheffer had made friends with the king of
Kauai, nominally under the suzerainty of the Kamehameha the First. A
trading fort was built on Kauai and the way was open for Russian
influence and trade to permeate the Hawaiian economy and society as
the English and Americans were to do in OT.

The money was there in the trade, the Russians already were collecting
the otter pelts using native Alaskans as their agents, the sandalwood
was available in Hawaii and the rest of the Pacific islands. The china
and tea would have a market in reverse and continued trade would allow
the Russian-Hawaiian cooperation to grow.

By the end of the 19th Century the Russians would have sugar and other
plantations to supplement the waning supply of sandalwood. The China
trade would continue to flourish and the Russians would already have a
fleet in being in the Pacific when the Japanese attacked in 1905.
Instead of being trapped in Port Arthur there would have been Russian
ships patrolling the "Russian Lake" that was the North Pacific.
Stations at Sitka, San Francisco and Hokkaido would augment the
Manchurian base.

Russian Fort Elizabeth
In 1815 the Russian doctor, Georg Scheffer, arrived in Hawaii to gain
trading privileges from King Kamehameha, who had created a kingdom
incorporating all the islands of Hawaii. The Russian went to Kauai,
nominally under the control of King Kaumualii, to salvage Russian
cargo being held in Waimea. Once on Kauai, Scheffer gained the
confidence of King Kaumualii when he promised the king that Czar
Nicholas would help him to break free of Kamehameha's rule. Kaumualii
allowed Scheffer to build a fort near Waimea and two others near
Hanalei. However, Scheffer did not have the backing of the Russian
Czar and was forced to leave Kauai. Russian Fort Elizabeth eventually
went under the control of Kamehameha supporters and years later was
used to put down a rebellion by Kaumualii's son, George Prince
Kaumualii. It is the only remaining Russian fort in Hawaii.

I doubt that other powers (especially Great Britain) are going to allow
Russia to become this powerful in the Pacific.  I once wrote that "I have
toyed with the idea of the Russians succeeeding in establishing a lasting
protectorate in Kauai, if not all the islands, but finally gave it up
as implausible--too many other powers had greater interests in the
islands."  However, I do sympathize with the spirit of Mike Cleven's reply
at http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/7e850f63dd0002f5
"The prospect of a Hawaiian-Russian pidgin strikes me as very
interesting; I'll leave the geopolitics for later..."

The thing to remember in Hawaii is the kings were very susceptible to
flattery, and a Russian Hawaiian partnership in getting all of the tea
(and china) out of China might have had more impact than all the
English visits by the royalty. The trick of the Hawaiian kings and
queens was staying alive in an atmosphere of Western diseases. Would
the Russians have carried fewer?

Forgot, the Russians have an existing base in the Pacific in Alaska, a
source of wealth in the otter and had established friendship with the
Spanish Californios to the extent that if Rezanov had lived he would
have been in effective charge of Northern California from about 1810
on. Gold had been discovered by then but not publicized, if Alta
California is Russian California the Mexican war might end with the
United States getting their railroad into San Diego but not much else.
