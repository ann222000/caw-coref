The Preservation and Acceleration of Astrology in the Arabic World

Master's in Astrological Counseling Program, Lee Lehman advising
Second Term, January 3, 2001

Modern astrological fundamentals came down to us via the Hermeticism
and Neoplatonism of the Renaissance; the continued and refined astral
religion of the Babylonians. (1) The Greeks were the first to refine
that astral religion, with Greek geometry and concepts of realism
based on the confidence in reason. This stems from an appreciation of
the physical world and its mechanics as indicative of the will of the
Gods. The rise of the Christian cult and notions of discounting that
physical beauty and exploration of God through the material world and
senses, brought about the steady decline of intellectual pursuits in
the west, and the ages now known as "Dark". The most influential and
wide ranging tenets of Christianity stemmed from the notion that the
physical world and reasoning mind were at best deceptive and at worst
evil. This led to the demise of astrology in that area by the period
of the 5th and 6th centuries AD. (2) But it never completely died out
in the more highly educated and more careful record-keeping Byzantine
area. In this area the Greek works were preserved more carefully, and
during the period of the 8th to 11th centuries astrology flourished in
Islamic lands with the translation of Greek works beginning around 770
AD, with a revival in astrology among the Byzantines around 1000 AD.
This led to the revival in western Europe in the 12th century and a
rightful reinstatement of the proper validity of astrology as one of
the most important arts. Not only did Arabic cultures save
astrological tradition and important notions and aspects of the art,
but because of the inclusion of Hermeticism, Neoplatonic and
Neo-Pythagorean teachings --with the broad acceptance allowed by
Islamic culture of pre-Islamic beliefs including astrology-- reason
also survived, allowing them to add greatly to the astrological
knowledge base. This fostered the techniques and focused applications
in astrology by the Arabic world that continued and enhanced the Greek
tradition of exploring the physical with reason via mechanics. Because
of this perspective, the surviving Greek astrological works were saved
and eventually worked on, advanced, and improved.

Stemming from this belief in reason increasing the free will and
extricating us from necessity, the Arabs had a thirst for knowledge,
and they became aware that the Byzantines, Persians, and Hindus knew
things that they did not.(3) By inviting foreigners to Baghdad and
sending emissaries to other countries to obtain books, the development
of astronomical tables called zij and observatories evolved, leading
to the great achievement of Ulugh Beg's (1394-1449) observatory built
in Samarkland in central Asia with an astronomical table of 1000
stars.(4) The Toledan Tables prepared by Moorish astronomer al-Zarqali
were translated early and became the model for the Alfonsine tables
prepared under the sponsorship of Spanish king Alfonso X (1226-1284)
that are an important development for western astrologers-- and their
use dominated this aspect of astrology into the Renaissance. During
this period astrology was again accelerating in popularity, and
tables, so essential to astrologers and to the practice of it, are the
evidence of that notion.

The first revision of the Almagest was accomplished by the 10th
century astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-86) and in his Book on
the Constellations of Fixed Stars he outlined improved magnitudes,
along with Arabic versions and identifications. This also began the
period when Ptolemaic models and their flaws were beginning to be
questioned. Flaws were observed that ran against the Aristotelian
Greek models of uniform motion especially the equant.(5) After
rediscovering some of these works by the Islamic astrologers it was
discovered that Copernicus dealt with the relatively similar problems
with the Greek notions of celestial mechanics:

....when Ibn al-Shatir's work was rediscovered in modern, times, it
was realized that it employed geometrical devices similar to those
later used by Copernicus, who was like-wise scandalized by the
Ptolemaic equant. Copernicus took the radical step of turning the
Earth into a planet, but when it came to developing detailed models,
many of the problems he encountered were not so very different from
those confronted by his predecessors. In the Commentariolus, a
preliminary sketch of his Sun-centred theory that circulated in
manuscript in the early years of the sixteenth century, Copernicus
used an arrangement equivalent to Ibn al-Shatir's in order to
eliminate the equant and generate the intricate changes in the Earth's
orbit. In the fully developed De revolutionibus (1543), Copernicus
reverted to the use of eccentric orbits, but he used a model that was
the Sun-centred equivalent of one developed at the observatory founded
by al-Tusi at Maragha in Persia. No Latin translation of these Arabic
works has been found, nor is any Latin account of them known. A Greek
translation of some of al-Tusi's writings found its way to Italy in
the aftermath of the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and Copernicus
studied in Italy from 1496 to 1503 and acquired a knowledge of Greek.
(see Hoskin)

As indicated, Ulugh Beg's (1394-1449) observatory falls right within
this period. Despite historians need to separate the two worlds of
east and west sharply not only by literal but philosophic distance,
the Persian and Islamic contributions motivated by astrological and
philosophical concepts of necessity and reason were very important and
powerful indeed.

After Rome's fall the second civilization to rise was based on the
religion of Islam emerging from Arabia with its founder Muhammad
(570-632). The rise of Islamic philosophy is partly the result of
--and developed with-- the translation of a considerable amount of
Greek philosophical literature that had survived the Muslim conquests.
In so doing the Greek astrology was revived and reinvigorated. Muslims
believe that their religion is the completion of Judaism and
Christianity and see the all as one, Islam meaning "surrender to
Allah" (God).(6) Hence they were more tolerant of the continuance of
arts that they believed allowed a full surrender in that way.

Al-kindi (796-873), known as the "philosopher of the Arabs" held a
position at the court of Baghdad and died shortly after 870. He is
recognized as the first Arab philosopher of importance and wrote
extensively on astrology. As a prolific author, he developed ideas on
the basis of Neoplatonized Aristotelianism. He argued the integrity of
blending revelation and reason and that reason compliments revelation
by working through with reason to a valid philosophical theology. He
introduced a brilliant blending and explanation of the distinctions
between the passive and active intellect, thereby blending the
external world and internal world. It is said that it was he who
introduced Abu Ma'shar to astrology.(7) The work during this period
focused on the historical applications of astrology through
conjuctions. This led to the "Golden Age" of Islamic astrology in the
tenth and eleventh centuries. During this period, the transmission of
Islamic astrology to western Europe appears to have been coincident
with the translation of Tetrabiblos in 1138.

The inclusion of the Platonic notions of necessity and of increasing
free will through reason, was saved and eventually carried over to
Medieval Europe, becoming a part of the Renaissance to be carried over
once more into the intellectual revolution of the 17th century.(8)
Because of the notion that reason could mitigate the demands of
necessity, Arabic astrological innovation developed masterfully with
concepts of Solar returns, conjunction patterns of major planets and
other methods of measurement out of the need to understand the will of
God through them, hence, the typical modern presentism fallacy that
the Arabic world of astrology was laden with deterministic
perspectives of unyielding fate, are unwarranted. This defective
thinking is typically the result of the lack of astrological knowledge
and qualification on the part of historical researchers. The focus on
technique in the Arabic world, was a mathematical extension of the
Babylonian notion that destiny was negotiable. These techniques were
developed with the idea of invoking talismat (9) as an extension or
compliment to the judgment rendered through astrological application
(nunjun). Hence astrology enhances free will, instead of denying free
will by simply announcing predestined and unchanging events. (10)

This development was fostered by works such as those delineated by
Mohammed Abu Ma'shar al-Balki (Albumasar).

[11] Jafar ibn Muhammad, known as Abu Ma`shar the astrologer, said to
the lovers of philosophy and the higher sciences, possessors of long
speculation on the wonders of the conditions of the wanderers in the
entire sky: Insofar as the higher bodies signify the things existing
in this world through the powers of their natural motions, then what
is the advantage in being ignorant of this knowledge? [12] He would
achieve this only by the knowledge of the degrees of the &lt;zodiacal&gt;
circle, the number of the signs and their names, the quantity of the
degrees of each one of them, their Lords, their dignities and their
natures, and the natures of the twelve places and the planets; and by
the knowledge of the northern and southern constellations, their
conditions and indications. [13](14)

During the reign of Charlemagne as king of the Franks from 768-814,
Abu Ma'shar (787-886) was the imposing Arabic writer of astrology who
gave up Hadith, the traditions of the prophet Mohammed, in his 30s or
40s to focus on astrology, which lead to his becoming
