DH was listening to the radio on the way to work this morning, and
called me about a dog event that is this weekend.  One of the things
mentioned was a dog singing contest.  I am soooooo bummed.  Franklin
would have nailed that competition.  All I would have to do is bring
along a recording of any Law and Order theme song, a local news
station's theme song, or Thunder Road and he would have been singing
louder and with more enthusiasm than any other dog - no doubt about it.

Watching L&amp;O has taken on a whole new mood.  I practically break into
tears everytime I realize we don't need to &quot;mute&quot;.  The gold dogs just
lie quietly at our feet or on the sofas.

I've never had a singing dog, Franklin sounds like he was quite a character.
I'm so sorry for your loss.  Memories, so very hard.  Will keep Franklin in
my thoughts today, and you too.

best,

Awww!  It's the little, everyday things like that that always get
me, I think because they are unexpected.

We had a dog when I was a kid who was a singer.  He used to sit
outside the corner church and howl along with the music.
Eventually, all the neighborhood dogs started joining him.

I'm sure they are certainly emotionally loaded moments, but right now.
probably too raw to be happy.

I had an old dog that died back in 1989 that crooned like no dog I've ever
heard.  He had perfect pitch. He was a purebred, a show dog, but nothing
else every distinguished him as special, except he was such a kindly gent,
that his claim to fame was that he never hurt anything and his amazing
operatic voice.

He always sang the exact same song with precision. He had perfect pitch.
If he heard a siren in the distance, we knew.

He'd start out with a low
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
raise an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
raise an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
raise an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
lower an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
lower an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
lower an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
lower an octive
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Perfect everytime. It was amazing, yet chilling, and so ever beautiful
When he sang, anyone within earshot would stop, and listen in silence and
awe.

Decades later, I still remember that song with crystal clarity, and will
always remember that dog with a fondness and amazement, even though he
never distinguished himself as special in any other way.

His name was CH Windy Cove Gunnar's Running Gun

I'm surprised you never heard him in AK!   It was a bit ear piercing,
but one more part of his unique charm.  The coffee grinder would set him
off too.  Who needs an alarm clock?

I had that with Finn too. There was a local car service commercial that
Finn actually hummed along with in his last 3 or 4 years. Actually hummed!
It was sort of a qiet howl, but his lips were closed. When the commercial
came on, he'd lift his head, slightly close his eyes and start humming at
the tv.

For about a year I couldn't see that commercial without a tear in my eye.

&gt; Bella has started smiling by just looking hopeful and showing her

&gt; DH pointed it out to me. &quot;Remind you of anybody?&quot; Of course it did.
&gt; Spencer used to smile like that. It feels comforting to see it in
&gt; another dog. Bella is six now, and I think it's just been this year
&gt; that it started...

&gt; The vocalizing has increased, too.

Mine is a song by Katrina and the Waves - &quot;Walking on

&gt; (Franklin's singing career)

&gt; That's pretty cute. Did he always do that with that music only?
&gt; Or was it one day he had heard it a few times and suddenly
&gt; decided to just start singing at that point?
">

I'm trying to remember but he was still very young and I think it
started with &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; (The BBC version of Trading Spaces).  I
think it's sax that did it for him.  We went to see BRUCE last week and
the songs were heavily Clarence Clemons.  We both remarked that Franklin
would have loved that concert.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So how are your gold dogs handling things? Have any pack shifting
&gt; taken place yet?
">

No, and I really don't expect it.  Dynamics of 2 vs 3 are so different
to start with.  I think Rudy has some confusion about the order and
speed in which he gets things (balls thrown to fetch, where his food
bowl gets places, etc), but Lucy is pretty status quo.    I am very glad
they have each other and that I have both of them.  It helps to
normalize things a great deal.

If I recall (I haven't listened through it for a long time),
there was some whistling involved.  Plus, my ex really liked
that particular double album and played it a lot.
