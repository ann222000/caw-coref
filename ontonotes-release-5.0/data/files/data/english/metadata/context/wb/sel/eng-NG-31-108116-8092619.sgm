Nutrition and health care
for the longevity of dogs and cats

by Susan G. Wynn, D.V.M.

http://www.treshanley.com/cic/arthritis.html

Spondylosis &amp; Degenerative Spinal Diseases If your
veterinarian has told you your dog has spinal degeneration
(spinal myelopathy) and that there is nothing you can do to
stop the progression of weakness and rear end stiffness that
eventually becomes rear end paralysis, he is WRONG!

Dr. Belfield's program can CURE spinal degeneration.

If your dog has been diagnosed with Spondylosis, this
program will also help with that, but it will not totally
cure spondylosis. The program comes from a really
good California veterinarian, Dr. Wendell O. Belfield
of San Jose, CA.

In the mid-1970's, Dr. Belfield put together an all natural
supplement program to CURE spinal degeneration.  He
was successful.

The program is cheap and effective.

Generally it can have the dog RUNNING, climbing
stairs and jumping onto your bed in 5-7 weeks.

It works by strengthening the dog's immune system.

Here is what Dr. Belfield wrote in his book, &quot;How To
Have A Healthier Dog&quot; by Wendell O. Belfield and
Martin Zucker:

&quot;What happens in this condition is a deterioration of
the tissues in and around the vertebrae.  The cause may
be related to the aging process.  The breakdown causes
inflammation and some degree of pressure on the spinal
nerves that supply the hind quarters.

Difficulty in control of muscle movement and walking
develops into a paralysis.  The animal goes down in the
hind quarter and pathetically drags himself around on
his front legs.  I have seen forelegs become affected also.
The legs get stiff and unsteady and eventually the animal
is down altogether and can't get up.

Symptoms: Poor appetite, pain and sensitivity in the
spinal region.  Progressive loss of control of the hind
leg muscles with accompanying dragging of the paws,
swaying of the hind end, and reduced ability to walk
and jump.  Eventually develops into a hind quarter
paralysis and can move forward, affecting the forelegs
and the brain.  Most frequently seen in aging dogs.&quot;

The cure for this condition is deceptively simple: Vitamin
C (Ester C preferred) and Vitamin E are given per the age
and weight of the dog.  If you require this information, get
in touch, or you can get Dr. Belfield's book from your library
or from his web site.  The information is in a chart in the
center of the book.

The rest of the program consists of:

Comprehensive vit/min supplement (I use Theralin VMP
vit/min tablets by Lambert Kay - you can get them cheapest
from Cherrybrook 1-800-524-0820 or Jeffers pet catalog 1-
800-533-3377) Dose  per instructions on the bottle. I
STRONGLY suggest that you use only Theralin VMP. An
owner who used a less comprehensive vit/min found that
her dog did not respond for 3 weeks longer than any other
dog on the program.

I also give BYS (garlic/yeast tablets) It's loaded with B
vitamins. Also from Cherrybrook - Dose is per instructions
on the bottle.  A side benefit is that it gives the dog's skin a
smell that fleas and ticks find offensive, so they tend to stay
off the dog. People cannot smell anything different.

I get the C &amp; E at the drugstore. Don't bother to buy C with
rose hips, according to Belfield it does nothing to help the C
work. I do, however, buy the brand that says on the label,
&quot;No soy, no sugar, no preservatives, etc.&quot;

Do not buy time released vitamin C.  If you feel compelled
to use a buffered C, get sodium ascorbate (Ester C) as
Belfield says it is least likely to cause diarrhea and that it is
the one that works best in dogs.  I've always used regular
vitamin C with my dogs.  I smear cream cheese on the pills
and give them with the dog's meal.

Give the above with food as vitamins are absorbed better
that way and the food buffers the dog's stomach against
the acidity of the vitamin C. If the dog's stool becomes
mushy, it's the C. Back down on the dose and gradually
over a week or so build it back up to the proper level,
OR start lower than recommended and slowly build up
to the proper amount over a 3 week period.

Belfield is not a crazy vet. His methods are currently being
taught to vet students. The supplement program takes 5 -7
weeks to totally strengthen the dog's immune system. I've
seen dogs respond in a week and heard of one case where
it took a Great Dane 7 weeks.

Belfield's program is GREAT for skin problems, chronic
ear infections, and rear end problems with older dogs
(spinal degeneration). The information for the above
supplementation program is based on the work of Dr.
Wendell O. Belfield, a San Jose, CA veterinarian.  Dr.
Belfield does not specifically advocate the use of
Theralin VMP or BYS. You can buy Dr. Belfield's book
through his web site: http://www.belfield.com/books.html

Unfortuantely when I put my dog on Rimadyl
the problems were not as well known.

It was when the drug was new.  My collie did developed
liver problems after months of use.  I took him off the
drug immediately but had to put him to sleep 2 weeks later.

Also Deramaxx.

BET YOUR LIFE ON IT.

Date: Mar 14 2000
Since Rimadyl's 1997 launch, the FDA has received
reports of about 1,000 dogs that died or were put to
sleep and 7,000 more that had bad reactions after taking
the drug, records and official estimates indicate.

The FDA says such events are significantly underreported.

My 9 year old female Samoyed was put on the poison
Rimadyl for about 2 weeks for arthritic knee. I read
posts to this group discussing the horrors of the drug.

She was in such pain, I decided to give her a few more
dosages. I should have listened to you wise posters.

For three days my dog had weird yellow urine and yesterday
and today wouldn't eat. I took her to the vet and found out
she now has liver damage and will be in the hospital for as
long as it takes to reverse the damage--IF  they are able to.

Cady, our Sammy, was a pretty healthy dog until the Rimadyl.

Now she's on the critical list. The makers of Rimadyl
should be put out of business. They are marketing poison
and should be forced to take it themselves.

His name was George - he was on Rimadyl less than

Make up your own minds about this drug.  I would
never use it for any of my animals again, ever!

Please let me know how you dog is doing !  I pray he
does not die like my dog (a chocolate lab, named George)
did.

There are too many people who have lost pets to Rimadyl,
myself included, for you to defend in ANY way the drug
company who produces it!

I challenge you to have the same feelings about
Rimadyl once you have suffered a loss because of it.

wish it on _any_ other dog.

I sincerely hope your dog will survive.  This drug
has been on the market for over a year now - the
Pfizer Co. that makes this drug has been allowing the
deaths of hundreds of dogs to occur because they will
not make public the many serious and deadly side effects.

The drug was never tested properly - it was not tested
long enough - the dosage prescribed in the U.S. is higher
than that prescribed in England where Rimadyl has been
used for a much longer time.

There are many people who have owned older dogs and put
them on Rimadyl as a last resort to help ease the pain
of arthritis.  When the poor dog dies, does the owner
question the use of Rimadyl?

Probably not.  They just think their dog died of old age.

Pfizer does not care - they care about the money they make
from the drug!  Vets don't care - they care about keeping
the drug manufacturers happy and looking out for each other.

The drug reps don't care - they tell the vets what the
vets want to hear so the vets will buy the drugs that
they sell at an incredible markup

Only the dogs suffer - if your dog is on Rimadyl you had
better make your vet do blood workups, etc. - or your dog
may join the other poor animals who have suffered liver
problems, severe hemorrhaging, perforate ulcers and god
knows what other effects from this drug.

SEVERELY.

From: Jason J Hamilton (wild ... @stargate.net) Subject:
Arthritis Drug &quot;Rimadyl&quot; Kills Dogs! Please read on ...
Date: 2000/03/13

Read the article on the front page of today's Wall Street
Journal. It states that Rimadyl is toxic and creates deadly
liver complications in dogs. Vets new this as early as 1998
as have not properly informed dog owners.

My Golden just died of Liver Cancer and
he was on a strong dose of Rimadyl.

Please warn owners and friends of these risks.  Vets are
supposed to warn owners of the side-effects but they have not!

My former vet (Bradford Hills Vet in Pittsburgh PA)
certtainly did not!  They stated that Rimadyl was like a
prescription aspirin and handed me a bottle for my dog's
first treatment. I would not have treated my dog had I
known otherwise.

Also, these Vets receive perks from the drug manufacturer
Pfizer when they buy Rimadyl to sell to animal owners.
Vets could get points from Pfizer for each Rimadyl
purchase they made; points were redeemable for Palm
Pilots, Zip Drives, and other equiptment!

Please reference today's Wall Street Journal for additional
details, and please, pass this information on to other animal
owners.

Thank you. Jason Hamilton

Post Script: Rimadyl is a frequently prescribed anti-
inflammatory used to treat dogs with arthritis.  Pfizer
studies as far back as 1997 show deaths as a result of
ingesting Rimadyl.  Being that the drug is very profitable
to vets and the drug manufacturer, many vets and Pfizer
have not communicated the drug's deadly risk to the public
as originally requested by the FDA. The FDA had asked
Pfizer to state one of the drugs side -effects as, &quot;death&quot;.
Pfizer chose to withdrawal their commercials rather than
state &quot;death&quot; as a side-effect.

&gt; The guy who developped this product is a human

&gt; Humans are not dogs. Drugs that work for humans
&gt; may not work for dogs and vice-versa. The intro also
&gt; uses a lot of loaded words to try to make people feel
&gt; guilty about choosing pharmaceuticals over natural
&gt; products.
&gt; Arthritis cannot be reversed nor can it be cured (from
&gt; www.arthritis.ca ). There are natural fluctuations in the
&gt; course of the disease that may result in the artritis appear
&gt; to be cured. (In humans)
&gt; The clinical study - Well, first of all the fact that over 6
&gt; months, those that didn't take it showed no fluctuations
&gt; in their symtoms I find hard to believe. Also, how do
&gt; you tell, on a scale from 1-10, what level your dog is at?

&gt; How were the dogs chosen? Were the levels of activity
&gt; the same? There are a lot of questions about the trial
&gt; that make me put it down to wishful thinking.
&gt; &quot;It allows nutrients to intereact with one another,
&gt; breaking them down into the simplest ionic forms.
&gt; This ultimately has a positive effect on regenerating
&gt; joint and tissue repair.&quot;

&gt; I call bullshit. So far, *no* biochemist, biologist or
&gt; scientist has been able to come up with anything that
&gt; can come close the the effectiveness of enzymes. And
&gt; natural products don't work as well either. For him to
&gt; claim otherwise is a lie.

&gt; He also makes some interesting claims that are
&gt; contradictory. First that it is small and low molecular
&gt; weight, and then that it detoxifies by chelating.

&gt; To chelate something, it needs to be (relatively) large,
&gt; and thus not a low molecular weight and not small.
&gt; (Note, this all depends on what molecular weight range
&gt; he is talking about.)

&gt; &quot;The properties in ArthrotolT bind with the pollutants,
&gt; which catalyzes the breakdown of these toxic pollutants.&quot;

&gt; This sentance just makes no sense at all.

Fulvic- the Super Antioxidant

For an antioxidant to bind to a free-radical, the
antioxidant molecule must have unpaired electrons
of equal and opposite charge to that of the unpaired
electrons of the free radical.

The beauty of Fulvic is that it is a bi-directional super
antioxidant that carries both a negative and a positive charge.

It can act as an acceptor or a donor in the creation of
electrochemical balance.  If it encounters free-radicals
with unpaired positive electrons, it supplies an equal
and opposite negative charge to neutralize the bad effects
of the free radicals.  Likewise, if the free-radicals carry
a negative charge, the Fulvic molecule can supply positive
unpaired electrons to nullify that charge.  Fulvic is such
a powerful, natural electrolyte that it can eradicate any
form of free radical.&quot;

The Nobel Prize in Physics 1948

Presentation Speech by Professor G. Ising,
member of the Nobel Committee for Physics

&quot;Anderson had at the time succeeded in obtaining
a few photographs, showing the temporary existence
of free positive electrons. These electrons, on account
of their strong tendency to fuse with negative ones,
seemed to exist free in a space filled with matter, only
as long as they move at a great speed.&quot;

The Nobel Prize in Physics 1948

Presentation Speech by Professor G. Ising,
member of the Nobel Committee for Physics

Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen.

According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation,
the Nobel Prize for Physics may be awarded for
&quot;discovery or invention in the field of physics&quot;.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in awarding
this years' prize to Professor P.M.S. Blackett of Manchester,
for his development of the Wilson method and his
discoveries, made by this method, in nuclear physics and
on cosmic radiation, indicates by the very wording of the
award, that its decision is motivated on both the grounds
mentioned in the statutes.

Particular weight may perhaps, in this case, be laid
on the discoveries made, but these only became possible
by Blackett's development of the method and the apparatus.

Experimental research on the different kinds of rays
appearing in nuclear physics has always been based
to a great extent on the power of an electrically charged
atomic particle, when moving at high speed, to ionize
the gas through which it passes, i.e. to split a number
of gas molecules along its path into positive and negative
ions. Thus, one is able to count the number of particles by
means of the Geiger- counter tube; such a counter being a
special, very sensitive kind of ionization chamber, in which
even a few ions produced by the ray are sufficient to release
a short-lived discharge by an avalanche-like process.

But the whole course of the particle appears infinitely
more clearly by the method invented by C.T.R. Wilson
in 1911 and named after him. The radiation is allowed
to enter an expansion-chamber, containing a gas saturated
with water vapour. A sudden expansion of the chamber
cools the gas, and cloud-drops are then formed instantly
around the ions produced along the tracks of the particles.
By suitable illumination these tracks can be made to stand
out clearly as if they had been described by luminous
projectiles.

The &quot;Altmeister&quot; of modern nuclear physics, Lord
Rutherford, once called the Wilson chamber &quot;the
most original and wonderful instrument in scientific
history&quot;.

But still, the immense value of the Wilson method for
research purposes did not become really apparent until
the early twenties, and the credit for this changed attitude
was largely due to the work of Blackett, who has ever
since been the leading man in the development of the
method. Before 1932 his work dealt chiefly with the
heavy particles, appearing in radioactive radiations.

In 1925, he obtained the first photographs ever taken
of a nuclear disruption, namely the disruption of a
nitrogen nucleus by an alpha particle of high velocity;
the photographs clarified quite definitely the main
features of the process. In this investigation and others
from the same period he also verified, by accurate
measurements, that the course of a collision between
atomic nuclei always follows the classical laws of
conservation of momentum and energy, provided the
energy value of mass, as given by the theory of relativity,
is also taken into account.

These two laws, together with the conservation law of
electricity, i.e. that positive and negative electricity are
always produced together in equal amounts, form a set
of three fundamental principles of general validity.

Blackett was soon to give to these principles an
unexpectedly rich content by new experimental
discoveries. In 1932 namely, he turned his interest
to the cosmic rays, which at sea level are mainly
vertical.

The Wilson cloud chamber had already begun to be
used at different places for the study of these rays, but
with very low efficiency, as only about every twentieth
random photograph showed the track of a cosmic ray.

This was due to the fact that the rays are disperse
both in space and time, and they must pass through
the chamber only about a hundredth of a second before
or after the moment of expansion, if they are to give a
sharp track.

Nevertheless, Anderson had at the time succeeded in
obtaining a few photographs, showing the temporary
existence of free positive electrons.

These electrons, on account of their strong tendency
to fuse with negative ones, seemed to exist free in
a space filled with matter, only as long as they move
at a great speed.&quot;

Meanwhile, The Freakin Simply Amazing Puppy
Wizard was just BHOWENIN up on some neuclear
physics. From: &quot;The Nobel Prize in Physics 1948
Presentation Speech by Professor G. Ising, member
of the Nobel Committee for Physics

Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Immediately after completing this apparatus, Blackett
and Occhialini discovered, in cosmic radiation, positive
and negative electrons appearing in pairs; their tracks
were deflected in opposite directions by a superposed
magnetic field and they seemed to start from some common
origin, often situated in the wall of the chamber.

Sometimes such tracks appeared in great numbers, whole
&quot;gerbes&quot;, on the same photographic plate, demonstrating
the existence in the cosmic radiation of veritable &quot;showers&quot;
of positive and negative electrons.

Shortly afterwards they established, in collaboration with
Chadwick, that electron pairs are also produced by hard
gamma rays, i.e. by the radiation of ultrashort wavelength
emitted by certain radioactive substances; here the energy
relations could be studied more closely than in the case of
cosmic rays.

I shall try to give an idea of the great importance of
these experimental results, even beyond the fact that
they established irrefutably the existence of positive
electrons.

The discovery of the pair creation of electrons led, on
the theoretical side, to the acceptance of two fundamental
radiation processes of a reverse nature, which may be
called transmutation of light into matter (represented by
electron pairs) and vice versa.

These processes take place within the framework of the
three fundamental principles, just mentioned, regarding
the conservation of momentum, energy and electricity: a
quantum of light passing close to an atomic nucleus, may
thus be transformed into a pair of electrons; but this is
possible only if its energy at least equals the sum of the
energy values of the two electronic masses.

Since the rest mass of each electron corresponds to 1/2
million electron volts, the light must possess a frequency
at least corresponding to 1 million electron volts. If there
is an excess of energy (i.e. if the frequency of the light is
still higher), this excess will appear as the kinetic energy
of the two electrons created.

Reversely, the meeting of two slow electrons, opposite
in sign, results in their fusion and annihilation as material
particles; in this process two light quanta, each of 1/2
million electron volts, are formed; these fly out from the
point of encounter in opposite directions, so that the total
momentum remains about zero (for even light possesses
a momentum directed along the ray).

About Us

Hello, I am Dr. Michael Halliday. I have been in clinical
practice for the past 25 years. It has been over 11 years
since I lost both my parents to cancer. Through my loss I
have spent the last 10 years doing research in the areas
of nutrition and water.

As a complimentary healthcare physician I have developed
products which have had a significant impact on the health
and well being of my patients. By adding just a few drops
of this product, it affects water purity and energy. &quot;Giving
life back to water so that water gives life to us.&quot;

Having six animals in our family (five dogs and an African
Grey Parrot), I felt it was my moral obligation to give them
the benefits of this one of a kind product. I can now honestly
say &quot;Tested on humans and found to be safe for pets.&quot;

Hello, I am Michael Halliday, the son of Dr. Michael Halliday,
and President of VetCuresT LLC. I have always been an
animal lover and a passion of mine is  to help all animals.

It has been 3 years now since I lost my dog Stud, a
Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Stud was a great dog. He
was very affectionate and had a wonderful personality.
Stud developed a rare kidney disease and sadly I had
no choice but to have him put down. I couldn't stand
seeing him suffer anymore. It was one of the hardest
things I have ever done.

Shortly after Stud was gone, I decided that I wanted help
pets and animals all around the world. My father and I
came up with the idea to use his products that he had
developed for his patients, to help pets and animals.
Now we have reformulated one specific product to
target Arthritis.

This product is called ArthrotolT, which targets arthritis
and arthritic symptoms. This product is even being used
as a preventative for animal arthritis.

I know what it is like to have a pet with arthritis. My
family had a Bull-Mastiff when I was a kid. At the age
of 8 he was put down because of his arthritic pain. He
couldn't move around the house, the pain made him miserable.

Please don't let your pet go through this problem let
alone yourself.

I don't want people to see their pets or animals suffer
like I had to. My goal for VetCuresT LLC is to help as
many pets and animals as I possibly can. By helping pets
and animals I get the added bonus of helping the owner.

Any owner will get to see the tremendous results. I truly
believe that VetCuresT LLC can and will help you and your
pet. That is why VetCuresT LLC has reformulated other
products to target specific needs for your pet or animal.

So please check back soon to check out new products.

&quot;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
I came not so send peace, but a sword.
&quot;For I am come to set a man at variance against
his father, and the daughter against her mother
and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
&quot;And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
