As a decrepit father takes delight,
To see his actiue childe do deeds of youth,
So I , made lame by Fortunes dearest spight
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
For whether beauty,birth,or wealth,or wit,
Or any of these all,or all,or more
Intitled in their parts,do crowned sit,
I make my loue ingrafted to this store:
So then I am not lame,poore, nor dispis'd,
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance giue,
That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
And by a part of all thy glory liue:
Looke what is best,that best I wish in thee,
This wish I haue,then ten times happy me.

As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth,
So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth or wit,
Or any of these all, or all or more
Entitled in their parts do crowned sit,
I make my love engrafted to this store.
So then I am not lame, poor nor despised
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And by a part of all thy glory live.
Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
This wish I have; then ten times happy me.

On the tenth day, Demeter went to Eleusis in disguise. There King Celeus
and Queen Metaneira entertained her and graciously offered her the
position of wet-nurse to their son Demophoon. IAMBE, the LAME
princess, tried to cheer Demeter up with silly lascivious verses. Baubo,
the dry nurse, joined her in a joke too. (The three of them formed a
Triple-Goddess.) Then, an elder son of Celeus, Abas, accused Demeter of
greediness while she drank Barley-water. Without thinking, Demeter threw
him a grim look, and turned him into a lizard. Later, she felt bad, and
decided to make Demophoon immortal. She put him in her sacred fire,
chanting, to burn away his mortality. Unfortunately, Metaneira came in
before the ceremony was complete, and Demophoon died. Now that was two
sons dead by a goddesses hand, and Celeus began to think his house was
cursed. In his weeping his name got changed to Dysaules (which means
&quot;of an unlucky house&quot;), and Demeter told him to stop weeping, because
she would bestow many gifts upon his third son Triptolemus. Triptolemus
was the one who told her the information she needed about Persephone.

Thank you so much, Robert. Was looking forward to another sonnet. Just to
start an argument (as I promised David I would speak when I felt a sonnet
included something that spoke against WS of Stratford's candidacy)--

Was WS lame? (And I don't think this is just a metaphor for the poet writing
poor meter.) Oxford, by the way, mentions in a letter discovered by Alan
Nelson that he is lame.
Was WS poor?
Was WS despised?

The father imagery in this sonnet is troubling to me, although I think we
could simply decide, as the sonnet starts with &quot;as,&quot; suggesting a
comparison, that the poet is acting in a paternal way.

Hope this starts a good discussion. I'll duck.
Regards,
Mouse

and what I want has come true: so I am lucky ten times over.

The speaker feels that his friend's having all the
advantages is enough to make up for his own disadvantageous
position. (I do not see any implication that he gets
anything from his friend's wealth and so have paraphrased to
avoid it. Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't, but the poem does
not say so.)

Line 3, 'made lame'. Literal or metaphorical? I come down on
the side of metaphor for the following reason.
'Lame' plainly picks up 'decrepit' in line 1. (The weakness
of age typically shows itself in difficulty in getting
about: what is it that begins on four legs, continues on two
and ends on three?) Now, lines 1-2 are a simile. So it is
essential that the speaker is not in fact a decrepit father,
if a decrepit father is what he is compared with. Otherwise
the simile is pointless, mere repetition. So 'lame' is a
metaphor as in the line the commentators quote from the
Quarto of King Lear: 'A most poor man made lame by Fortune's
blows'.

Line 7: 'their'. I should have accepted Capell's 'thy'
against the Quarto. It is pointless to say that these things
'sit' without saying plainly where they sit.

Line 8, 'engrafted'. I take this to emphasise the firmness
and permanence of the graft. The fact that a graft depends
on the tree for nourishment seems not relevant.

Line 9, 'poor nor despised'. Burrow quotes Malone, from whom
I differ in fear and trembling. 'Lame' is explained by
referring back to lines 1 and 3. What explains 'poor' and
'despised'? I can see nothing in the poem. So it must be a
natural thing to say in the environment in which the poem
was written. First, it seems to me a natural thing for a
professional poet to say in addressing an aristocratic
patron. It does not quite say 'Please alleviate my poverty',
but it does not disown it. Secondly, the speaker is some
kind of version of the author and we know that actors were
often despised. So 'lame' here is a metaphor, explained by
lines 1 and 3, while 'poor nor despised' is meant literally,
if perhaps with some exaggeration.

Line 10. All commentators point out that here the shadow
creates the substance, which is the wrong way round for the
convention. That is purely a verbal effect: we have to
re-interpret the words 'shadow' and 'substance' to avoid
making the poet talk nonsense.

Line 13, 'Look what' is just a way of saying 'Whatever'. The
three phrases progress, using the words 'best ... best' and
'wish ... wish' to work up to the climax at the end of line
14.

I agree with Robert that it probably is a metaphor.
Otherwise, if the speaker is finding comfort for his
disadvantages in the addressee, and one of those
disadvantages was an actual physical lameness, why wouldn't
he mention the physical ability of the addressee? Rather,
the disadvantages of the speaker seem to lie in &quot;beauty,
birth, wealth and wit&quot;, things he can satisfy himself with
in the addressee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Was WS poor?

If we're going to go down the biographical road and
if these poems were written in the early 1590s, then
Shakespeare probably was poor, or at least not rich, and,
being an actor, was quite low on the status totem pole.

Right - in the same way that a father can find
satisfaction in his son's accomplishments, so does the
speaker find satisfaction and the fulfillment of many things
missing from his own personal life in the addressee.

I'm trying to relate this poem back to the
discussion of whether 36 is connected to 33-35.

In 33-35, the addressee did something that caused
disgrace for the speaker.

In 36, it is unclear whether the &quot;blots&quot; that are
mentioned refer to the disgrace of 33-35, or whether they
are the personal shortcomings the speaker has already
mentioned - in 29, for instance.

Now we come to 37. Here, clearly, the shortcomings
of the speaker mentioned have nothing to do with the actions
of the addressee. 37 has nothing to do with 33-35. Agreed?
But what about 36? It seems to me that 37 supports the
argument that 36 is also unconnected to 33-35. In 36, the
poet finds private solace in the good reputation of the
addressee which heals his own &quot;bewailed guilt&quot;, while in 37
the addressee's beauty, birth, wealth and wit help satisfy
the speaker's personal shortcomings in those areas. In both
36 and 37, the speaker's relationship with the addressee is
of the 'what is yours is mine' variety. (Although you then
have to wonder why the speaker's bewailed guilt and poverty
are not then part of the addressee. But no matter.)

If the sonnets are a series of episodic scenes from
a relationship, then it seems to me that 33-35 are out of
place, and that 36 and 37 form a part of the scene outlined
in 29.

Or at least that's the way I see it now, before I've
read any of the commentaries.

It's not the first time he's done this. Remember Sonnet 6? All about
happiness and multiplication by ten:

That's for thy self to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee...

I thought back to it as soon as we started this sonnet.

P.S. Cannot agree that the lameness is necessarily metaphorical.

The phrase &quot;ten times&quot; is used many times by Shakespeare

particular imaginings and feelings of wholeness, but not the addressee

Or perhaps the shadow is the 'atmosphere' of the

enough for one to enjoy the many attributes of the
addressee? Reflected glory of being part of the addressee's

Yes, I'm still puzzled.

I don't really agree, Gary. I think this sonnet is going to bring up
problems for both of us if we're honest, because

beauty
birth
wealth
wit

are in some way in the poet's mind set against

lame
poor
despised

These are not complete opposites. I would say that beauty is contrasted with
lameness, a form of ugliness or imperfection as far as the poet is
concerned; birth and wealth against poverty; and wit against what the poet
feels himself to be: despicable or at least despised. The last is the most
difficult to understand as an opposite although &quot;wit&quot; appears to have had a
wide range of meaning.

There is also a clever crossover at the beginning of the sonnet. I wish I
could diagram like Art, because although the lame friend who takes comfort
in his friend's worth becomes, as a simile, the decrepit father who loves to
see his active child, there is also a correspondence between the active
child and the inactive (lame) poet.

Lameness is mentioned twice. If it were just in the sonnet once and in the
imaginative part of the simile, I would be inclined to think it
metaphorical. But it is twice, and it is the *realistic* part of the
comparison:

I, who am lame, take comfort in your worth and truth (real)
(just) as (introduction to second part of simile)
(here comes the imaginative part) an old (inactive/decrepit) man is
delighted by his child's vigorous deeds.

I'm sorry. I know what I mean but am having trouble articulating.

In any case, it is a recurring theme. Look at sonnet 89:

&quot;Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt...&quot;

and rather more ambiguously, in sonnet 66:

&quot;And strength by limping sway disabled...&quot;

Lameness appears to be a preoccupation of the poet. I believe so many people
are quick to call it a metaphor because Oxford says in at least one letter
(Sobran says several, but I cannot confirm that he is correct) that he is
lame:

&quot;Wherfore when yowr Lordship shall have best tyme and leysure yf I may know
yt I will attend yowre Lordship as well as a lame man may at yowre house.&quot;
(March 25th, 1595--Oxford to Burghley).

But the sonnet poses difficulties for Oxfordians also, I believe, because as
I wrote above, the BIRTH and wealth of the addressee appear to be contrasted
with the poverty of the poet; however, I promised David Webb I would speak
when we came to something in the sonnets that had helped persuade me that
Oxford was the author. We are now, as far as I'm concerned, at first base. I
do not say that this is a strong argument. It is just one of the lines in
the sonnets that when taken with others tipped me towards accepting Oxford
as best candidate. I have no intention of arguing about it with anyone who
comes across this post.

Um, not sure about this. It seems he uses it more in the sense of *becoming*

&gt; Line 3, 'made LAME'. Literal or metaphorical? I come down on
&gt; the side of metaphor for the following reason.
&gt; 'LAME' plainly picks up 'decrepit' in line 1. (The weakness
&gt; of age typically shows itself in difficulty in getting
&gt; about: what is it that begins on four legs, continues on two
&gt; and ends on three?) Now, lines 1-2 are a simile. So it is
&gt; essential that the speaker is not in fact a decrepit father,
&gt; if a decrepit father is what he is compared with. Otherwise
&gt; the simile is pointless, mere repetition.

&gt;: 'A most poor man made LAME by Fortune's blows'.

On the Tenth day, Demeter went to Eleusis in disguise. There King Celeus
and Queen Metaneira entertained her and graciously offered her the
position of wet-nurse to their son Demophoon. IAMBE, the LAME
princess, tried to cheer Demeter up with silly lascivious verses. Baubo,
the dry nurse, joined her in a joke too. (The three of them formed a
Triple-Goddess.) Then, an elder son of Celeus, Abas, accused Demeter
of greediness while she drank Barley-water. Without thinking, Demeter
threw him a grim look, and turned him into a lizard. Later, she felt bad, and
decided to make Demophoon immortal. She put him in her sacred fire,
chanting, to burn away his mortality. Unfortunately, Metaneira came in
before the ceremony was complete, and Demophoon died. Now that was
two sons dead by a goddesses hand, and Celeus began to think his house
was cursed. In his weeping his name got changed to Dysaules (which means
&quot;of an unlucky house&quot;), and Demeter told him to stop weeping, because
she would bestow many gifts upon his third son Triptolemus. Triptolemus
was the one who told her the information she needed about Persephone.

You could try Shakespeare Look Up. I went through it earlier today. It's a

Granted, but there's a bit of a scramble in this sonnet, where there are
strange comparisons and partial contrasts throughout. The &quot;worthy&quot;
addressee, though, is still a bit of a puzzle to me. The old man is
inactive/slow/decrepit against the child's activity. The older poet is
slowed by lameness (and/or something metaphorical) against the addressee's

&gt; You'll also notice that he doesn't use &quot;active&quot; in
&gt; connection with the addressee, which would make sense if he
&gt; meant &quot;lame&quot; in the sense of physical disability.

Unless we take &quot;worthy&quot; to mean desirable, and &quot;lame&quot; to be undesirable. I'm
having trouble.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lameness is mentioned twice. If it were just in the sonnet once and in
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;imaginative part of the simile, I would be inclined to think it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;metaphorical. But it is twice, and it is the *realistic* part of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comparison:

&gt;&gt;&gt; True. But we're still confronted with the lack of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; corresponding virtue in the addressee.

&gt;&gt;I think in the poet's mind, lameness is a defect and is therefore the
&gt;&gt;opposite of beauty. He's clearly worried about how his &quot;lameness,&quot;
whatever
&gt;&gt;it means, will affect how he is viewed by the addressee.

&gt; And I would think in the poet's mind that physical
&gt; ability would be the opposite of lameness, in the sense
&gt; you're using it.

You're wanting the poet to be more exact than he is. I am too, but for some
reason, unless we're missing something that was understood at the time, he
refuses to cooperate.

I've been looking in the Bible. There's no question that &quot;lame&quot; meant what

Raphael, The Healing of the LAME Man, 1515-16
Bodycolour on paper mounted onto canvas (tapestry cartoon),

&lt;&lt;(Acts 3:1-8) 'Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. And a certain man LAME from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter saith, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.'

A crowd is gathered at the gate of the Temple in Jerusalem. At the centre stands Peter (bearded, in a blue and yellow robe), healing the LAME man, while John the Evangelist (the youthful figure in a salmon-coloured robe) looks on. This act symbolises Peter's spiritual healing and conversion of the Jews. Taken together with The Conversion of the Proconsul, it illustrates the different missions of Peter and Paul; whereas Peter's mission was to convert the Jews, Paul's was to convert the Gentiles. Raphael based the ornate, twisted columns on antique examples in St Peter's Basilica in Rome. At the time, they were thought to have come from Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.&gt;&gt;

TALOS means both &quot;suffering&quot;&amp;&quot;ANKLE.&quot;

[L]eave thee alone, for the comparison
[O]f all, that INSOLENT GREECE, or haughtie Rome
[S]ent forth, or since did from their ashes come.

probability of TALOS (Greek: &quot;sufferer&quot;) ~ 1/1,235
----------------------------------------------------------------

Achilles' HEEL shot through with Paris's (i.e. Apollo's)
arrow corresponds to the Arrow Star of the Babylonians,
i.e. to Polaris, the &quot;North Nail.&quot;

That pinch/arrow/nail corresponds to the pin which stoppers the single vein
of TALOS, the bull-headed bronze man given to Minos by Zeus to guard Crete.
TALOS is also the name of Daedalus's so-called apprentice, whom Daedulus
pushes off the roof of Athene's temple on the Acropolis out of jealousy over
the boy's great skill and out of disgust over the boy's supposed incest with
his mother POLYCASTE (&quot;MUCH TIN&quot;). (Athena had taught
Daedalus his craft.) This is why Daedalus is exiled and ends up in Crete,
where he builds for Minos's wife the hollow cow so she can have sexual
relations with Poseidon's beautiful white bull from the sea (which Minos
decided not to sacrifice, offering to Poseidon a surrogate instead) and in
turn, for Minos, the labyrinth so Minos and his cuckolding wife and her
offspring the Minotaur can live in humiliated seclusion. By some accounts
the human TALOS - whose soul flew away as a partridge, Aphrodite's sacred
bird - is Hephaistos's father by Hera. In this sense TALOS is not Daedalus's
student but his teacher. Indeed, the fall of TALOS seems to correspond both
to the Great Reversal and to the proto-mythological sacrifice of the king.
The name TALOS means both &quot;suffering&quot; and &quot;ANKLE, ANKLEbone.&quot;
Proto-mythological, Aphrodite-like Medea killed the bronze TALOS by pulling
out said pin; and some say that the Argonaut Poeas did the job by shooting
him in the ANKLE with a poison arrow. Similarly, Laius snatched his infant
son Oedipus at birth and pierced the boy's feet with a nail. Clearly TALOS
resonates with Hephaistos, Oedipus and Achilles (among many other heros
who are poignantly wounded in the ANKLE or HEEL). The name Oedipus
means &quot;swollen foot,&quot; and it may derive from the Greek oedipais, &quot;son of
the swollen sea,&quot; i.e. &quot;son of Poseidon,&quot;&quot;son of Proteus ('the first man')&quot;;
in other words, he who, like Tristan, arrives by sea and returns (or is
returned to) the sea. The name Laius, I might add, smacks of the name
Claudius, which means &quot;LAME,&quot; Claudius being Hamlet's evil uncle.

Consider the following germane commentary
from Robert Graves' Greek Myths:

TALOS's single vein belongs to the mystery of early bronze casting by the
cire-perdue method. First, the smith made a beeswax image which he coated
with a layer of clay, and laid in an oven. As soon as the clay had been well
baked he pierced the spot between heel and ANKLE, so that the hot
wax ran out and left a mould, into which molten bronze could be poured.
When he had filled this, and the metal inside had cooled, he broke the clay,
leaving a bronze image of the same shape as the original wax one.&gt;&gt;

The quote is:

This suggests that what I'm saying is correct--&quot;lame&quot; may carry a double
meaning in the sonnet. I especially like &quot;halt,&quot; which appears in a later
sonnet in connection with &quot;lame&quot; and in that context has so many different

Sorry to post so much, but have been thinking a lot about this as the words
keep running through my head. When I see the word despised, I think of _The
Messiah_, and &quot;He was despised,&quot; probably my favourite aria. It of course
comes from Isiah also. Here it is from the KJV:

Isaiah 53:1-6:
Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a
dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there
is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men;
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces
from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have
turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity
of us all.

This verse, considered Messianic prophecy, does seem to parallel the sonnet
in several ways. The poet is afflicted (lame), despised, uncomely when
compared to the addressee, and, at least in some of these sonnets about
guilt and despisedness and (a tiny bit) in this one, sorrowful. And the
verse might also make a bridge into the earlier &quot;thirties&quot; sonnets. The
addressee has done wrong, but the poet carries his griefs and sorrows???
Possible?

Err . . . yes . . . but stronger then. It's a word that

What the poet meant is the same as what the poem means?

I think you have to separate the text and context to begin with, then
you label each term with its galaxy of possible meanings. A short
lyric poem has high word load in relation to meaning to account for,
so in a way less is more.

It gets psychological when you start factoring in ambiguities
operating at the unconscious level, as does happen when we express
ourselves--not just intention. I think Empson assumes constructive
ambiguities are an inherent part of literature and language, and of
course he has done an exhaustive study of Shakespeare's sonnets.

Since LynneE was in Empson's class, we can assume she carefully
navigates the territory avoiding figurative cheese in the
word-meanings mousetrap. Maybe she will do a follow-up study on some
part of Emson's, but hesitates. I read that the gifted sometimes have
to attack the mentor in the process of asserting an independent voice.
Did Shakespeare do that? I don't know. Marlowe would seem to have
been his mentor as he was Fletcher's. bookburn

Of course. But Lynne's reading (following
the standard Stratfordian commentators)
assumes that the poet had some simple
intention, or message, in mind -- one addressed
by an anonymous poet (or one who might as
well have been anonymous) to the general
middle-class reader about some 'great topic'
such as Love, Time, Death, Eternity, etc.
Strangely, they do not seem to realise that
there could have been only one possible
outcome from such a process -- utter banality.

Such readings must also completely miss
his humour, and the fact that he was writing
about his own life (and that of his addressee)
and their highly complicated situations.

To suggest that he probably meant only
TWO things in the use of a crucial word
in such a sonnet is to grossly
underestimate him.

3. So I, made lame by Fortunes dearest spight
4. Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.

Simply not true -- in the case of a Shake-

The trick is to find the probable
figurative meanings. Of course, that
requires knowing who the poet was, to
whom he was writing the sonnet, and
when and why. All that is necessarily
ruled out for Strats and quasi-Strats.

It may have many more. I'm just establishing that there is very likely both

&gt; 3. So I, made lame by Fortunes dearest spight

&gt;&gt; I think you have to separate the text and context to begin with, then
&gt;&gt; you label each term with its galaxy of possible meanings. A short
&gt;&gt; lyric poem has high word load in relation to meaning to account for,
&gt;&gt; so in a way less is more.

&gt; Simply not true -- in the case of a Shake-
&gt; spearean sonnet. We are not dealing with
&gt; a 'silly love song'.

&gt;&gt; It gets psychological when you start factoring in ambiguities
&gt;&gt; operating at the unconscious level

&gt; There was relatively little unconscious
&gt; in Shakespeare's use of words.

&gt;&gt; as does happen when we express
&gt;&gt; ourselves--not just intention. I think Empson assumes constructive
&gt;&gt; ambiguities are an inherent part of literature and language, and of
&gt;&gt; course he has done an exhaustive study of Shakespeare's sonnets.

&gt;&gt; Since LynneE was in Empson's class, we can assume she carefully

we have &quot;Yeshua Shmi&quot; at 20 characters equidistance in reverse,

which means &quot;Yeshua is My Name&quot;.

Passing through the letter &quot;shin&quot; of Yeshua we have &quot;Mashiach&quot;,

in reverse, at 42 characters equidistance.

Can there be any doubt that the suffering Messiah, described in Isaiah 53,
is none other than Yeshua Ha'Mashiach?

This result was found by Yacov Rambsel, and I would highly recommend his
book

&quot;Yeshua - The Name of Jesus Revealed in the Old Testament&quot;,

Frontier Research Publications Ltd.

-----------

According to a legend now some 2000 years old , the name of the young
traveller and companion to uncle Joseph, in Cornwall was 'Essa' or 'Esse'

Putting aside any associations with the collar worn by Garter Knights, YES
means 'eyes' and YEWYS; 'Yews', and YEWRE; a water-bearer.

Some element survives in Chaucer, ESIE, gentle, light.

ESSE, as a verb, means 'to ask' /Herne, and is otherwise 'ease' and 'is'

EST: host /Weber, and love, munificence [from A.Sax]

They wrought hym mekylle woo,
As y yow say, be Goddys est.

Though little A. Sax would have been extant in Cornwall in the year dot.
Better etymologies need be traced through p-Celtic to modern use.

&gt;&gt;re-interpret the words 'shadow' and 'substance' to avoid

&gt; I'm still not sure what the speaker means by
&gt;&quot;shadow&quot;. Does he mean his image of the addressee gives him

I think 'this shadow' means the 'store' (line 8) which
contains beauty, birth, wealth, wit (line 5) and other
things like them. What makes it a shadow is that these are
all abstract nouns. They give weight ('substance') to the
speaker's own participation in the same store; they make him
significant in the world.

This is more far-fetched than I really like, but Shakespeare
often flies beyond the reach of those of us who like to keep
our feet on the ground. Here I think he is using 'shadow'
and 'substance' in a deliberately riddling way.

Lynne knows who the poet was. She

where he stood in relation to the whole
of English history and English Literature.
She accepts that he was intimately
involved in the daily lives of some of the
most extraordinary and wonderful people
who have ever lived. She appreciates
(vaguely) that our poet was fully aware
that he was at a turning point in the history
of the world, and was a witness to, and
participated in, crucial events that
determined our own lives and, indeed,
our existence.

But she doesn't think that he wrote about
any of these events, nor about any of these
people. Why? -- Because if she had been
there, she would not have had much interest
in anything like that. She'd have found a
nice quiet corner, and written a poem about
her cat.

When you are a Strat, you are committed

You have all the intelligence and knowledge

So what have we learned from Sonnet 37 that we
didn't already know?

The speaker says that he is poor, despised and,
possibly, physically disabled.

The speaker so identifies with the addressee, that
any and all of the speaker's faults and shortcomings are
resolved in the positive attributes of the addressee.

One word description of the poem: Transference.

***************************************************

The story so far:

So after thirty-seven sonnets, what do we know?

The addressee or referent of the first thirty-seven
sonnets is probably the same person (although it
has been speculated that perhaps the speaker of the first
seventeen poems is different). At any rate, we are assuming
that the same person is the addressee of these sonnets.

The speaker says the addressee is physically
attractive. The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man. (1 - 7, 9,
13, 17-19, especially 20)

The speaker says that the addressee is narcissistic.
(1 - 4, 6)

The speaker may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits. (1 - 4, 6, 9)

The addressee is male. (3, 6, 9, 16, 19-20, 26, 33)

The speaker is male. (20, 32)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range. (1 - 4, 6,
8 - 13, 16, 17)

The speaker claims he has no interest in sexual
relations with the addressee. (20)

The speaker probably wasn't a member of the
nobility. (25) We still don't know which class the addressee
belong to. Some readers have suggested that certain words
and phrases used in the sonnets indicate that the addressee
is of noble birth. (37)

The speaker's life involved travel that took him
away from the addressee. Possibly, the travel involved
service for the addressee. (27-28)

Note that we still don't know where the speaker or
the addressee live.

The speaker is preoccupied at night by images of the
addressee. (27-28)

The poet says he is in disgrace for some reason, and
that he is a self-described outcast of some sort, and that
he feels sorry for himself and envious of others, a feeling
that is dispelled when he thinks of his relationship with
the addressee. (29)

The speaker tells us that his sad memories are
dispelled when he thinks of the addressee. (30)

The speaker says that he is poor, despised and,
possibly, physically disabled. (37)

The speaker so identifies with the addressee, that
any and all of the speaker's faults and shortcomings are
resolved in the positive attributes of the addressee. (37)

The speaker says he sees, in the addressee, the
embodiment of former deceased loves. (31)

The speaker says the addressee has a pleasant
speaking voice and enjoys listening to sad music. (8)

The speaker says the addressee has a gracious and
kind presence. (10)

The speaker seems to think that the addressee has
some sort of love for the speaker. (10, 25)

The speaker seems to have some sort of affectionate
feelings for the addressee, calling him such things as
&quot;love&quot;, &quot;dear my love&quot;, &quot;master-mistress of my passion&quot; and
&quot;Lord of my love&quot;. (13, 19, 20-32)

These feelings are so strong that they leave the
speaker tongue-tied about those feelings in the presence of
the addressee. (23)

The speaker expresses humility about his ability to
express, in writing, his feelings for the addressee. (26,
32)

A snag appears in the relationship between the
speaker and addressee. (33, 34)

The snag that appeared in the relationship between
the speaker and addressee seems to concern something that
the addressee did to the speaker which caused the speaker
shame. The addressee, however, is contrite, and the speaker
has forgiven him. (34)

While it's not certain, the snag that appeared in
the relationship between the speaker and the addressee
probably concerns a love stolen from the speaker by the
addressee. (35)

For some reason, the speaker thinks that the
addressee will be dishonoured by publicly associating with
the speaker. (36)

The speaker is an aesthetic snob. (11)

The speaker may believe in astrology. (15)

The speaker initially thinks that having children is
a better method than a painting or a poem for the addressee
to preserve himself. (16, 17) However, the speaker comes to
say that he can preserve the beauty of the addressee in his
poetry (18, 19).

The speaker, having posed a problem for the
addressee, is offering a solution to that problem - namely
that the addressee should have children - specifically, a
son. (1-14, 16, 17). (But let's remember that it's only the
speaker's assertion that beautiful people have some sort of
obligation to the world to propagate or preserve their
beauty.)

The speaker seems mainly concerned with the
addressee's beauty, and not overly much with the addressee
as a person. (Exceptions: 10, 14, 16, 22)

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his beauty,
the speaker is, at the same time, acknowledging that beauty,
and so is flattering the addressee.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the speaker and the addressee.

Good God. You take the one concrete thing that may really link Oxford
to this sonnet--that the author was likely lame--and throw it away so
that the sonnet could just as well be by anyone. And then you manage,
quite wildly, to weave a web of historical back story that does not
even begin to explain the sonnet but to the delight of the
traditionalists suffocates the possibility that Oxford was lame at the
time of writing. Everything you say hinges on the ridiculous
speculation that &quot;abundance&quot; means a good prospect of Elizabeth
marrying and providing an heir. Argal, the poem was written in 1579.
This is total and utter rubbish, your exegesis has no point of contact

how little they understand.

Thanks for the 'criticism'. Often I need some

poor. But now -- thanks to you -- I've
improved it and got into the opening lines.
I'll leave my original response stand, and

This is an absurd argument. Lameness was
common, (especially among the upper-classes
from gout). Most people were lame at various
points in their lives, some often, and for extended
periods. What Elizabethan do you know who
was never lame? On that basis, and if we take the
poet literally (and what else would you do?) --
the sonnet could, indeed, be by almost anyone.

Secondly -- a point I made which you don't dispute
-- the tone of the sonnet is light-hearted and does
not fit the nature of the serious wound suffered
by Oxford in 1583, which endangered his life.

THAT and all the associated hand-wringing
over her barrenness was THE major subject
from the time of her accession until around
1583 and her menopause. Unremarkably, it's
also the principal issue in the sonnets. It is
not at all surprising that, on the one occasion
she seemed delighted to consider marriage,
the poet would glory in the prospect -- if
perhaps, expressing some concern about the
character of her intended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is not true. I also explain the meaning
of numerous other words quite obscure to
you and to all the standard commentators,
such as 'shadow' -- a crucial term that mystifies
you and all your kind.

I provide a full explanation of Line 7, which
you (and your kind) have to re-word in order
to make 'grammatical', and even then can find
next to nothing to say about it.

7. Intitled in their parts, do crowned sit,

The 'title' that Alencon would bear was a
vital issue, to him, to Elizabeth, and to the
nation. The order in which the 'parts' would
be stated was similarly so, with Alencon
wanting his name as 'King Francis' stated
first . . . how they would 'sit' in their thrones
as joint monarchs (if Alencon got that bit
agreed) and so on and on (as you can
imagine about such matters -- even if you
don't know the historical detail).

You will note that I keep the Quarto 'their' in
line 7. Virtually all the idiotic Stratfordian
editors change it to 'thy' -- destroying its
entire sense. Naturally, they think they
must know best. Their justification is, as
Robert states:
&quot; . . It is pointless to say that these things 'sit' without
saying plainly where they sit. . .&quot;

Of course, that would be true -- if the
poet's addressee would not know
exactly to what he was referring.

&quot; . . Plainly Elizabeth was waiting for the councilors to advise her
to marry, as they had, consistently and cantankerously, for twenty
years. She was prepared to overlook Alencon's religion (he could
worship in private in his chapel), his demand to be crowned king,
his insistence that an English port be given to France and that
three thousand French footsoldiers -- a small invading army -- be
allowed to guard it. She did not even express any lasting offense
when told that Alencon would change the royal style to &quot;Francis
and Elizabeth, King and Queen of England,&quot; though at first she did
find this reduction in her dignity somewhat hard to accept, and was
pointedly rude to Simier in consequence. But her pique was short-
lived, and before long her infatuation returned. Suddenly,
unaccountably, against all odds Elizabeth was ready to get married,
and the last obstacle she expected to encounter was the opposition
of her male advisers. . .&quot; (Erickson, Elizabeth, pages 299-300)

8. I make my love ingrafted to this store:

Likewise I explain 'store' of Line 8. It is
our poet's usual word for the reproductive
capacity of a woman (as in 'store heifers').
The standard commentators have no idea
what to make of it, posing the wildest of
guesses.

Also, the oldest sense of 'ingraft' is:
&quot;1. trans. To graft in; to insert (a scion of one tree) as a
graft into or upon (another). &quot;

The line (and the whole sonnet) are clearly
about the intermingling of royal lines of
descent.

9. So then I am not lame, poore, nor dispis'd,

The poet was especially &quot;poore and dispis'd&quot;
in 1579, having just lost the remainder of
his fortune (and more) on the fool's gold
episode -- as well as being without an heir
nor any hope of one. What better date
would you suggest for this line?
(This question, like every other one I put
to you, will be ignored.)

10. Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,

As well as 'shadow', I explain 'substance' of
Line 10. The word 'substance' (and the whole
line) is to you and your kind (i.e. traditional
Strat) completely mysterious.

11. That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,

On Line 11, (in addition to explaining
'abundance' -- which no other exegesis does)
I explain why the poet will be 'sufficed' by it.
Again, this is quite mysterious to you and
your kind.

12. And by a part of all thy glory live:

Likewise on Line 12, I also explicate the meaning
of 'glory live' -- in both its senses. Neither
makes any sense otherwise to you and
your kind -- nor have you any other theory
to explain the line.

At her coronation Elizabeth stated:
&quot;It would be quite sufficient for the memorial of my name and
for my glory, if when I died, an inscription were engraved on
a marble tomb saying 'Here lieth Elizabeth, which reigned a
virgin and died a virgin.' . .&quot;

The poet is contrasting 'glory live' with
'glory dead', implying that he much
prefers the latter.

13. Looke what is best, that best I wish in thee,

Here the poet wants the 'bestial' -- the
'beast' 'in thee' -- the erect penis of Alencon.
The 'best' were also royalty, as against mere
nobility or commoners. He wants that in her
as well -- as against a common prick like that
of Leicester or Hatton. He wishes for that in
both senses, in that he wants a (best') royal
heir in her womb. He also puns on 'Bess'.
He wants another 'Bess' inside her. All this
he has been pleading for, since he was a
child, and since she first acceded to the
throne.

All of this makes ten thousand times more
sense than anything you will find in the
texts of your heroes -- the standard
commentators.

A _possible_ allusion in 'look what' is to:

&quot;a1577 Sir T. Smith in Strype Life (1698) App. 42
Look what Ladies and Gentlewomen be most fruitful, and
have most Children, if they look not for their Age most
youngly, best coloured, and be clearest from Diseases. &quot;

It's a quote from Oxford's tutor, dated
immediately before, and on the topic of
fertility in older women.

14. This wish I have, then ten times happy me.

Likewise, I explain the historical and
personal senses of 'ten times happy me'
of Line 14. It makes no sense under any
Strat (or quasi-Strat) 'scenario'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So, state how each of the 'points of
contact', that I mention above, is false,
in how it fails to fit the words of the poet,
AND the historical events and characters
of 1579. Take ANY other commentary
such as that of Robert Stonehouse, or of
Booth, and show line-by-line how it is

Too right. I didn't do a great job on
this sonnet, and there is much in it
that I have not yet grasped -- but it's
not hard to be ten times better than
any Strat or quasi-Strat.

----- New work on first quatrain ------

1. As a decrepit father takes delight,
2. To see his active childe do deeds of youth,

The poet is jokingly pointing out how his
mistress is -- for the first time -- behaving
like a young girl in her juvenile infatuation
for Alencon. He, by contrast, feels like an
old man, tolerantly amused at her antics.

(There _could_ be some other local
reference in addition -- some old courtier
with a young and dissolute son or
daughter -- but it is not essential.)

3. So I, made lame by Fortunes dearest spight

I provisionally date this sonnet to late
November 1579. Alencon arrived in
London on August 17th (leaving on the
29th) -- a visit that was, nominally at least,
both private and secret. Leicester and
other great lords of a Puritan leaning, such
as Walsingham, were fiercely against this
match, and fomented all kinds of opposition
to it over the next couple of months. Sidney
was put up to writing his famous letter to
the Queen. John Stubbs published his
famous pamphlet, which obtained a national
circulation.

The Queen was furious about Stubbs and
eventually succeeded (on November ...

are some extensions and further possibilities:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. So I, made lame by Fortunes dearest spight

[..]
&gt; It is also very likely that Sidney (given
&gt; his regard for the neo-Aristotelians)
&gt; had criticised Oxford's verse for its 'lack
&gt; of regularity' -- thereby suggesting that
&gt; his poetry was 'lame'.

"/>

Spenser in a letter to Gabriel Harvey and
dated from Leicester House In October
1579 says that Sidney and Dyer:
&quot; . . have proclaimed in their Areopagos
a general surceasing and silence of bald
rhymers, and also of the very best too;
instead whereof they have, by authority
of their whole Senate, prescribed certain
laws and rules of quantities of English
syllables for English verse; having had
thereof great practice, and drawn me to
their faction . .&quot;
(Ward, *Oxford*, p 175, quoting
Courthope, A History of English Poetry)

The famous 'tennis-court row' between
Sidney and Oxford appears to have taken
place in late August 1579. After Oxford
had called Sidney a 'puppy', Sidney
responded by alluding to the Earl's
incapacity to produce an heir. The poet
_may_ be regarding this as an allegation
of 'lameness' (of the middle leg) -- or of
'lameness' in a more general sense.

Walter Raleigh was appointed as an
intermediary by the Queen to sort out this
dispute. So it is possible that even as early
as this he was already her 'dearest spite' --
although I think it unlikely.

A well-known quote about Raleigh is
worth retailing, in passing:

&quot;Sir Walter Rawleigh,&quot; wrote Sir Robert Naunton, in what is
still the best thumb-nail sketch of Ralegh's career, &quot;was one,
that (it seems) Fortune had pickt out of purpose, of whom
to make an example, or to use as her Tennis-Ball, thereby to
shew what she could doe; for she tost him up of nothing,
and too and fro to greatnesse, and from thence down to little
more than to that wherein she found him, (A bare Gentleman). &quot;
(Winton, Raleigh, page 10)

Here a rough analogy is made by a
contemporary between the Queen and
'Fortune' -- and their joint treatment of
Raleigh

There is a further possible allusion in 'lame'.
In July 1578 during a royal progress to
Cambridge, Oxford had refused to dance
for some French diplomats representing
Alencon. The reasons are obscure, but
'lameness' would be an excuse (either at
the time or retrospectively), and there
MAY be a connection here -- although
I think it unlikely.

However, any and all of these are far
more likely than the kind of literal
'lameness' that Lynne and her type of
quasi-Strat so lamely imagine was in
the mind of our great poet.

Paul.

bottom of your last huge post and writing &quot;don't agree,&quot; but that would
just have posted your *stuff* (euphemism) back to everyone. Anyway,
I've already said what I think many many times with regard to many of
your disquisitions: You have absolutely no way of linking the sonnet to
your scenario, embellish it all you like. There is not ONE concrete
hook in the sonnet on which to hang your exegesis. You don't get that.
So be it.

I'd like to revisit this, Gary:

Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.

It can easily be rendered thus:

Let those who are enjoying good fortune
Boast of their honours and titles
Whilst I, whom fortune bars from speaking of honour and titles (because
of my disgrace?)
etc.

Read this way, it is actually a confirmation that the poet has or has
had honours and titles. Ambiguous passage, to say the least.

I am not asking you to. I am merely saying that there are two ways of

Funny you should say that. The novel begins with an enormous storm at sea.

***The poet keeps us on our toes (and sometimes on each other's toes)!
Application of disgrace itself is sufficiently ambiguous to muddy the
waters considerably; and questions of whether to observe the received
order of the sonnets as being the chronological order make certainty
all the more elusive. The &quot;fortune of such triumph bars&quot; passage comes
from 25; we have &quot;When in disgrace&quot; showing up in 29; are there hints
of actual disgrace prior to 25? Even with 29, I myself take the &quot;When&quot;
of &quot;When in disgrace&quot; simply as meaning a vague &quot;At such times as&quot;
rather than as indicating necessarily a present particular state of
disgrace; the poet is simply saying &quot;When I'm feeling blue and worse
off than others, you turn it all around for me&quot; with the aesthetic
intensity we expect of poetry. What would you say are the passages in
the Sonnets which indicate a clear specific &quot;event of disgrace&quot; rather
than simply the idea of disgrace being intellectually pondered?

Not quite an exact match? Come on, Lynne. They
have one word - &quot;poor&quot; - in common. And the idea expressed
in the biblical passage has nothing to do with the idea
expressed in the sonnet. The biblical passage is
admonishing someone for thinking that he is well off when,
if fact, he isn't. The poet, while acknowledging that
others may be well off, is admitting that he himself is
lame, poor and despised. There's not much of a 'match'
here at all.

So let's continue reading Sonnet 25:

Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.

In the poem the speaker is *distinguishing* himself
from the aforementioned &quot;great princes' favorites&quot;. If so,
then he was *not* such a favorite at any time. If so, then
he was not Oxford or, in all probability, any other
nobleman. Or so it seems to me.

It's all rather blurry to me at present, Brent. Perhaps we could revisit the
topic when we get to 126 or even 154 (I'm feeling optimistic today). I
believe that in some way the poet is really in deep disgrace, or he has
taken on the disgrace of the addressee, or that they are both somehow in
disgrace--&quot;disgrace,&quot; after all, is a pretty strong word and I cannot
believe it means just feeling blue--but as to the particular event, I'm not
at all sure and wonder if we'll ever know. The problem for WS of Stratford,
as I see it, is that he was never really in disgrace, but rather a
sharer/actor/businessman on the up and up. My point here is of course
arguable.

Another problem--many writers have mood disorders. It's possible that the
poet's mood is expressed in his art, so there some days, as you pointed out,
when he feels more poor and despised and disgraceful than other days.
Interesting that the poet expresses himself in Biblical terms in many of
these sonnets, particularly this one.

From Oxford's Geneva, a marked passage, Revelation 3.17:

For thou saist, I am rich and increased with goods, and have nede of

I think you're wrong, Gary. The verse is basically saying: &quot;You see me as
tremendously rich and privileged, and you don't see that I can empathise
with the fact that you're poor, miserable, and blind.&quot; In other words, the
speaker is believed to be wealthy, but understands poverty and misery. This
is very important, imo, in the sonnets. When the poet says he's poor,
miserable, despised, etc., it may simply be in comparison to his former
self, and it certainly doesn't mean that he doesn't appear rich and
privileged to others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not quite an exact match with being lame, poor and despised, but close.

&gt;I think you're wrong, Gary. The verse is basically saying: &quot;You see me as

&gt;with the fact that you're poor, miserable, and blind.&quot;

That's not what it's saying. The biblical passage
(addressed to the church in Laodicea) seems to be accusing
the church of false confidence. The church or, if you want,
the addressee, is being accused by the writer of thinking of
itself as rich and secure when, according to the writer, it
is no such thing - it is actually wretched. There is no
parallel here at all, that I can see, to the situation in
the sonnet.

No, the speaker is telling the addressee, the
church, that *it* believes that it is wealthy, but that it,
the addressee, is actually wretched.

That may or may not be true, but in any event, it

OK, you're right, I've misinterpreted. Thank you. Stupid me. Very slow
today; however, I still see a parallel to the sonnet.

I'm an Oxfordian, remember? The verse is marked in the Geneva. Oxford
reminds himself that although he may appear rich and powerful to others, he
is still, in God's eyes, poor and miserable. This dovetails with the
description in the sonnet.

Lynne, feeling a bit confused this evening. Let's leave it and come back
after some more sonnets.

The masts go down by themselves and swing across the deck like pendulums.

&gt;&gt;I get it entirely. It's the usual Strat demand
&gt;&gt;for a dated, signed, and witnessed affidavit
&gt;&gt;from Edward De Vere, saying &quot;I wrote this
&gt;&gt;sonnet&quot;.

&gt; Which, in turn, is not at all unlike the usual
&gt; anti-Strat demand for a dated, signed, and witnessed
&gt; affidavit from William Shakespeare of Stratford, saying &quot;I
&gt; wrote this sonnet&quot;.

"/>

I've never seen such a complaint before but, in
fact, the requirement would seem about right to me.

We KNOW Edward de Vere, Walter Raleigh,
Philip Sidney, and other courtiers wrote sonnets.
It was the fashion of the day for ambitious
courtiers. And we also know to whom they
addressed most of their sonnets -- and it was
not to some anonymous 'fair youth'.

But such activity might as well be on a different
planet as far as the Stratman is concerned. It would
be like seeing a John Wayne or Roy Rogers character
go into a frontier bar, and instead of having a fist-
fight with the local baddies, settle their dispute by
means of a sonnet-writing competition -- with the
winner being judged by the local sheriff or the
blowsy barmaid.

It would be something out of Monty Python.
The idea is nuts -- as is the notion of the Stratman
writing sonnets to a 'Fair Youth'.

Paul.
