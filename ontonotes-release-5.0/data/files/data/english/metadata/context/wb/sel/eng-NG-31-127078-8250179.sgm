Some people think the solution to all the world's problems is to throw more
U.S. Taxpayers' money at them.   I'd bet my bottom dollar that 90 percent of
this $1.2 Billion will end up in the pockets of Mex. politicians and in the
pockets of the drug cartel leaders themselves.

Insatiable greed cannot be satisfied by throwing more money on the fire.
This $1.2 Billion will just be added on to further swell the annual take
that the U.S. is, and has been, providing for those bums !

What really burns me is the fact that Mexico is, in fact, a wealthy nation.
The world's second richest man is a Mex.Citizen.   They have vast natural
resources.    Yet, seventy-five percent of their population is in dire
poverty and that is the population that they want to rid themselves of
instead of initiating domestic policies that will help their people.  They
want the U.S. to be the processing facility for their demographic sewage.
It's high time we turned that flow around in the other direction !

This Democrat Silvestre &quot;Reyes&quot; of Texas is surely in bed with the Mex. drug
industry.
Bah!   And, Humbug !

It is high time we quit calling Mexico &quot;Our Friendly Southern Neighbor&quot; and
began to recognize that they now pose the most serious threat of all nations
to the continued existence of the U.S. of A.  !!

Of all nations Mexico is our Worst Enemy.  That is where our war should be
going on; NOT on the parched, drifting, sands of the Middle East !

The reported $1.2 billion package the White House is working on to slow the
flow of drugs from Mexico surely will inflame GOP Rep. Tom Tancredo and the
anti-Mexico lobby. The Tancredo caucus will see no need to put one thin dime
into our neighbor to the south.

If structured right, however, the financial aid can be as much an investment
in the U.S. as it is in Mexico. The more that Mexico can fight its drug
cartels, the more the drug trade into our nation is interrupted. (We also
support efforts to curb drug use on this end, but that's not this package's
purpose.)

Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes has pointed out one example of how the
drug-fighting proposal could work. For instance, he says, the money could
help the U.S. monitor drug cartel conversations along the border and in
Mexico's interior.

Mr. Reyes would know. The El Paso legislator chairs the House Intelligence
Committee. And he offers another point skeptics should consider: The
proposal would help prevent Nuevo Laredo-style violence from growing along
the border.

Mr. Bush reportedly will work on the plan's fine points when he meets
tomorrow and Tuesday with Mexican President Felipe Calderón. The money will
be linked to specific uses, making it less likely to get lost in the Mexican
bureaucracy.

Mr. Bush also should use the meeting to discuss how to improve the quality
of Mexico's schools, a subject that is not far removed from the drug plan.
Without improvement in its campuses, where students don't have to attend
beyond ninth grade, Mexico's not going to have the workers to attract
bigger-dollar jobs. Without those jobs, more Mexicans will be tempted to
sign up with the financially lucrative cartels.

Yes, the U.S. should spend money to help Mexico police the cartels. But
good-paying jobs are another way to curb their influence. Better schools are
where Mexico will start growing those jobs.

Correction to the above ---------------------------  this damned Mex. is
Number 3 Richest In The World, vice Number 2.      See data on the three
richest below.

Instead of marching North, 100 million Mex. impoverished peasants should be
marching on the Capitol in Mexico City !!
=====================================================

2006 DATA . . .

Number 3

Carlos Slim Helu ($30 billion)
Latin America's most well-off gentleman has made great advances in the ranks
of the rich, adding $6 billion to his wealth this year. This leap comes from
selling his MCI and Altria shares and reinvesting in his Mexican telecom
interests, which obviously have been doing quite well, thank you. Other
holdings include a financial services organization, an airline and CompUSA.
His Rodin sculptures are found in Mexico City's Museo Soumaya art museum,
named after his late wife.
Quote: On his father's business sense: &quot;He taught me no matter how bad a
crisis gets, Mexico isn't going to disappear, and that if I have confidence
in the country, any sound investment will eventually pay off.&quot;
=========================================================================== ===
Number 2

Warren Buffett ($42 billion)
Warren Buffett was learning his lessons from the beginning. As a paper boy,
he claimed a deduction for his bike on his tax return. While still a child,
he bought stocks and sold them for a slim profit, only to see them quintuple
a few years later. You win some, you lose some; in any case, Buffett has an
incomprehensibly laidback approach to the ups and downs of business. That
our No. 2 billionaire is runner-up even after recent setbacks only
underscores the ammo in his war chest. Not bad, considering his annual
Berkshire Hathaway salary is $100,000.
Quote: &quot;If class warfare is being waged in America, my class is clearly
winning.&quot;

Number 1

Bill Gates ($50 billion)
It isn't easy to sneak out of a party when you're the host, but at
Microsoft, Bill Gates is doing his best. And why not? Gates' accomplishments
speak for themselves, and since handing off the CEO reins, he's getting more
involved with side projects and the company's various divisions. Presumably,
it's a refreshing change of pace from the corporate front lines and public
scrutiny, in which he's both revered and reviled. Outside the office, Gates
and his wife are involved in some heavy-duty philanthropy ($29 billion) via
the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Time Magazine named them 2005's Persons
of the Year, a three-way honor they shared with U2 frontman Bono
