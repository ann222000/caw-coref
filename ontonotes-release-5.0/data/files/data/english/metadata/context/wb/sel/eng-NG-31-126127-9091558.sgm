Well, I did a little research on MJ's current residence, as
disclosed by the NOD papers filed with SB County:

JACKSON, MICHAEL J
4770 DEXTER ST NW
WASHINGTON DC 20007

My, my, my, it must be cramped living there, especially compared to
Neverland:

Building Type   Single
Building Style  2 Story
Living Area     2,259
Year Built      1952
Bed Rooms       4
Bath Rooms      3
1/2 Bath Rooms  0
Total Rooms     8
Wall    Brick/Stone
Floor   Hardwood
Heat    Warm Cool
Air Conditioning Yes
Current taxable assessed value: $1,263,340 (which is chicken feed
for DC)

He's renting it from a woman (I'll refrain from making public her
name) who gives a mailing address of Victoria, BC. I'm seriously
tempted to drop her a line suggesting she have a trusted friend in
DC do a walk-through at 4770 Dexter, just to make sure MJ hasn't
destroyed her home as he's destroyed others (and hotel rooms as
well).

Anyhow, let's sum it up:

2259 square feet
2 floors, 8 rooms: 4 up, 4 down
4 bedrooms
Occupants: 1 adult (or 2, if Raymoan's shackin' with them), 3 kids.

Can you say &quot;packed in like a sardine can&quot; haterz and f'loons?

By the way - this very same address (which is a single-family
detached home in a residential neighborhood) is listed in online
phone books under the following moniker:

Dexter Co Llc
4770 Dexter St Nw
Washington, DC 20007
Phone : (202) 333-3563
http://washington-dc-1.a2zcity

Here's where it gets cute. A search of Washington DC's business
registrations turns up no company by that name. Besides that, the
name violates DC's rules for naming a limited liability company, to
wit:

A limited liability company name shall not contain the following:
The words &quot;Corporation&quot;, &quot;Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Limited Partnership&quot;, or
an abbreviation of these words.

What this means is DC wouldn't permit a company to be registered
under this name because it violates their naming conventions. So:
it's just a dummy listing to hide the fact that this is actually
MJ's residence, and not just his mail drop.

PAM: buy yerself a bus ticket to DC PRONTO! You might get there
before MJ beats feet!

Speaking of Raymoan, I see she made a substantial donation to
Hillary's campaign:

Address
4470 DEXTER ST NW
Washington DC

Note the address Raymoan gave. She listed 4470 Dexter St. NW, MJ's
is 4770 Dexter St. NW. Frankly, I think Raymoan's notoriously weak
writing skills tripped her up again. I bet she meant to write 4770
Dexter St. Because the address she provided matches a home owned and
occupied by another person, who happens to be a lawyer.
Interestingly, that lawyer represents corporations and individuals
in intellectual property disputes (among other areas of expertise).
But I doubt that Raymoan's living with the lawyer, just as I doubt
the lawyer's having her use that address to protect her privacy.
After all, Raymoan could just list her office address, couldn't she?
That is, if she still has an office address anywhere.

I think she's sharing that little house at 4770 Dexter with MJ and
the kids. Oooh, crowded! How the mighty have fallen!

Hell &quot;No, MJ, no, Raymoan. I _won't_ rent out my spare bedrooms or
basement to either of you&quot; Toupee

Wow, honestly, I take my hat off before you:-) LOL....Just one question now,
does Michael Jackson intend to go back to Dexter Street after his Jesse
Jackson b-day photo op, now that his address is splashed around on the 'net?
In former times, the press and public got Jackson's address only AFTER
Jackson had left a particular address.....but this foreclosure business
really rained into Bain's and Jackson's parade! ROTFL

Ancalime

P.S.: I bet ol' Roger has been knowing all the time where Jackson was
located, now it's the time he can confess it in his column..LOL

&gt;&gt; He's renting it from a woman (I'll refrain from making public her

&gt;&gt; tempted to drop her a line suggesting she have a trusted friend in
&gt;&gt; DC do a walk-through at 4770 Dexter, just to make sure MJ hasn't
&gt;&gt; destroyed her home as he's destroyed others (and hotel rooms as
&gt;&gt; well).

&gt;&gt; Anyhow, let's sum it up:

&gt;&gt; 2259 square feet
&gt;&gt; 2 floors, 8 rooms: 4 up, 4 down
&gt;&gt; 4 bedrooms
&gt;&gt; Occupants: 1 adult (or 2, if Raymoan's shackin' with them), 3 kids.

&gt;&gt; Can you say &quot;packed in like a sardine can&quot; haterz and f'loons?

&gt;&gt; By the way - this very same address (which is a single-family
&gt;&gt; detached home in a residential neighborhood) is listed in online
&gt;&gt; phone books under the following moniker:

&gt;&gt; Dexter Co Llc
&gt;&gt; 4770 Dexter St Nw
&gt;&gt; Washington, DC 20007
&gt;&gt; Phone : (202) 333-3563
&gt;&gt; http://washington-dc-1.a2zcity

&gt;&gt; Here's where it gets cute. A search of Washington DC's business
&gt;&gt; registrations turns up no company by that name. Besides that, the
&gt;&gt; name violates DC's rules for naming a limited liability company, to
&gt;&gt; wit:

&gt;&gt; A limited liability company name shall not contain the following:
&gt;&gt; The words &quot;Corporation&quot;, &quot;Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Limited Partnership&quot;, or
&gt;&gt; an abbreviation of these words.

&gt;&gt; What this means is DC wouldn't permit a company to be registered
&gt;&gt; under this name because it violates their naming conventions. So:
&gt;&gt; it's just a dummy listing to hide the fact that this is actually
&gt;&gt; MJ's residence, and not just his mail drop.

&gt;&gt; PAM: buy yerself a bus ticket to DC PRONTO! You might get there
&gt;&gt; before MJ beats feet!

&gt;&gt; Speaking of Raymoan, I see she made a substantial donation to
&gt;&gt; Hillary's campaign:

&gt;&gt; 4470 DEXTER ST NW
&gt;&gt; Washington DC

&gt;&gt; Note the address Raymoan gave. She listed 4470 Dexter St. NW, MJ's
&gt;&gt; is 4770 Dexter St. NW. Frankly, I think Raymoan's notoriously weak
&gt;&gt; writing skills tripped her up again. I bet she meant to write 4770
&gt;&gt; Dexter St. Because the address she provided matches a home owned and
&gt;&gt; occupied by another person, who happens to be a lawyer.
&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that lawyer represents corporations and individuals
&gt;&gt; in intellectual property disputes (among other areas of expertise).
&gt;&gt; But I doubt that Raymoan's living with the lawyer, just as I doubt
&gt;&gt; the lawyer's having her use that address to protect her privacy.
&gt;&gt; After all, Raymoan could just list her office address, couldn't she?
&gt;&gt; That is, if she still has an office address anywhere.

&gt;&gt; I think she's sharing that little house at 4770 Dexter with MJ and
&gt;&gt; the kids. Oooh, crowded! How the mighty have fallen!

&gt;&gt; Hell &quot;No, MJ, no, Raymoan. I _won't_ rent out my spare bedrooms or

&gt; Niiiiccccceeee!!! Sweet find.  I have a question.  Where is Wacko

It's been speculated for a long while that he was now mooching off of
Raymoron.  Thanks for the confirmation.

What will it take for her to chuck him, I wonder?  Will she wait until he
completely bankrupts her, too?

&gt; Wow, honestly, I take my hat off before you:-) LOL....Just one question now,
&gt; does Michael Jackson intend to go back to Dexter Street after his Jesse
&gt; Jackson b-day photo op, now that his address is splashed around on the 'net?
">

If I were he I wouldn't. Not with the lunatics he's got for fans. If
you ask me, he hasn't anything to fear from people who don't care
for him. They don't want to be within a thousand feet of him. It's
the ones who think they 'love' him and that he 'loves' them back
that he has to worry about. That and the occasional angry parent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In former times, the press and public got Jackson's address only AFTER
&gt; Jackson had left a particular address.....but this foreclosure business
&gt; really rained into Bain's and Jackson's parade! ROTFL
">

It sure did. And, by the way, I'm not the only person who's been
checking into this. One of the databases I consulted to get
information about this property keeps track of the number of
information requests made on a property during the current calendar
month. In just the first few days of November there'd been
thirty-seven queries run on that address. Coincidence? No.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; P.S.: I bet ol' Roger has been knowing all the time where Jackson was
&gt; located, now it's the time he can confess it in his column..LOL
">

It is a matter of public record, but I think Roger generally gets
his details more frequently from tipsters supplying him with
information than he does from doing research. He'll announce he's
been supplied with documents, which is different than saying he's
located the documents himself. Having folks send him copies of the
paperwork saves him a lot of time and legwork. I know from
experience that once it becomes known that you are seeking
information on a topic or individual, people from all over will go
out of their way to supply you with information. It can be hugely
entertaining, often enthralling, sometimes shocking, but alas, so
much of it can't be shared - at least not on record.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyhow, let's sum it up:

&gt; &gt;&gt; 2259 square feet
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2 floors, 8 rooms: 4 up, 4 down
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4 bedrooms
&gt; &gt;&gt; Occupants: 1 adult (or 2, if Raymoan's shackin' with them), 3 kids.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you say &quot;packed in like a sardine can&quot; haterz and f'loons?

&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way - this very same address (which is a single-family
&gt; &gt;&gt; detached home in a residential neighborhood) is listed in online
&gt; &gt;&gt; phone books under the following moniker:

&gt; &gt;&gt; Dexter Co Llc
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4770 Dexter St Nw
&gt; &gt;&gt; Washington, DC 20007
&gt; &gt;&gt; Phone : (202) 333-3563 http://washington-dc-1.a2zcity

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's where it gets cute. A search of Washington DC's business
&gt; &gt;&gt; registrations turns up no company by that name. Besides that, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; name violates DC's rules for naming a limited liability company, to
&gt; &gt;&gt; wit:

&gt; &gt;&gt; A limited liability company name shall not contain the following:
&gt; &gt;&gt; The words &quot;Corporation&quot;, &quot;Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Limited Partnership&quot;, or
&gt; &gt;&gt; an abbreviation of these words.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What this means is DC wouldn't permit a company to be registered
&gt; &gt;&gt; under this name because it violates their naming conventions. So:
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's just a dummy listing to hide the fact that this is actually
&gt; &gt;&gt; MJ's residence, and not just his mail drop.

&gt; &gt;&gt; PAM: buy yerself a bus ticket to DC PRONTO! You might get there
&gt; &gt;&gt; before MJ beats feet!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Speaking of Raymoan, I see she made a substantial donation to
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hillary's
&gt; &gt;&gt; campaign: http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&amp;ln;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Address
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4470 DEXTER ST NW
&gt; &gt;&gt; Washington DC

&gt; &gt;&gt; Note the address Raymoan gave. She listed 4470 Dexter St. NW, MJ's
&gt; &gt;&gt; is 4770 Dexter St. NW. Frankly, I think Raymoan's notoriously weak
&gt; &gt;&gt; writing skills tripped her up again. I bet she meant to write 4770
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dexter St. Because the address she provided matches a home owned and
&gt; &gt;&gt; occupied by another person, who happens to be a lawyer.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Interestingly, that lawyer represents corporations and individuals
&gt; &gt;&gt; in intellectual property disputes (among other areas of expertise).
&gt; &gt;&gt; But I doubt that Raymoan's living with the lawyer, just as I doubt
&gt; &gt;&gt; the lawyer's having her use that address to protect her privacy.
&gt; &gt;&gt; After all, Raymoan could just list her office address, couldn't she?
&gt; &gt;&gt; That is, if she still has an office address anywhere.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think she's sharing that little house at 4770 Dexter with MJ and
&gt; &gt;&gt; the kids. Oooh, crowded! How the mighty have fallen!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hell &quot;No, MJ, no, Raymoan. I _won't_ rent out my spare bedrooms or
&gt; &gt;&gt; basement to either of you&quot; Toupee

&gt; &gt; You're amazing. *muah*. &lt;3
