An army jawan of golabandha army AD college raped an 8 year old girl who stududies in standard 3. the girl got grievious injuries in his inner parts and at the risk of facing permanent infertility, the doctors of mkcg medical apprehend. Berhampur Police especially the SP tries to downplay the matter with the help of some of his media friends as he fears it would have a serious public outcry over the issue amidst the CM’s election tour to this district.
The girl is an orphan and lives with his maternal grandfather  n. seemanchal in gopalpur nuashahi. On 28th jan 12”o” clock  she went to cater food to his grandfather who was grajing cattle in a nearby field,. When she did not find his grandfather there she slept under a tree. At that time a jawan picked her up and took to the nearby bush behind the state bank training center and raped her. The girl with her tender power resisted a bit. She even bit the hand of the jawan. As per the girl, the jawan wore army dresses with a badge on his chest. She could not read it as she is unable to read English. Her grandfather after a long search found his grand daughter lying unconscious in that area. Now the girl’s life and future is in serious dandger. There are heinous scars in her face, arm and rupture of a delicate membrane in her inner part.
The inefficient brahmapur polce tries to hush hush the matter as they have no control of the jawans, they innocuously tell. They just wanted to douse the matter with the help of some media houses. So far there is no tt parade. The police did not sketch the figure of the culprit. There is no effort to trace the  jawan. The police don’t want to take any risk and happy with their monthly pc. If  the girl were SP’s daughter, the question arises whether he will reamain as such

Most heineous crime.
The  rape of an innocent girl of 8 years in Gopalpur area is a heinous crime.As we know this kind of incident affects the psychology of a tender girl in such way that she never forgets this as long as she lives.This kind of barbarous act ruins a young female both physically and mentally.The sad thing is, the victim is an orphan girl .The district administration must take the incident seriously and punish the capture immediately.
All our members and other like minded media people must see the development of this.Let us try to sensitize this issue without harming the girl .The girl must get all kind of assistance to forget this incident.As responsible citizen ,we should try to create somekind of awareness to prevent this type of gruesome incident.
Moreover,as per the circumstantial evidences and the statement of the raped girl indicates that the culprit may be an armed jawan,the Army AD college authority must take the incident seriously.
