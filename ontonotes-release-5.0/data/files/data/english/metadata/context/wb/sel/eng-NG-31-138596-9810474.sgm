Lagos, African writers honour NLNG prize winners

By Uduma Kalu

THE joint winners of the NLNG 2007 prize for literature, Mrs. Mabel
Segun and professor Akachi Ezeigbo, will be among delegates attending
the African Literature Association Conference holding (ALA 2008) at
the Western Illinois University, USA in Macomb, IL.

The information was contained in a message announcing the confab whose
theme is The Politics of African Oral Tradition: (In Honor of
Professor Oyekan Owomoyela)

It said Professor Owomoyela's critical and creative corpus on Yoruba
oral tradition and by extension, on African literature, is worthy of
celebration. With forty years of scholarly dedication to the
collection and dissemination of Yoruba tales and proverbs, this panel
celebrates his prodigious contribution to the translation and
preservation of Africa 's memory. In addition to a broad overview of
Africa oral traditions, this panel invites discussion of the retention
and adaptation of such indigenous repository of knowledge in the New
World. Panelists may also choose to pay homage to the works of
Professor Owomoyela as a possible approach to their presentation.
Critical perspectives beyond those of the scholarship of Professor
Owomoyela are highly solicited. We would like this panel to be &quot;inter-
generational&quot; in its composition if at all possible.

Interested panelists should send a one-paragraph abstract and their
affiliation to Niyi Afolabi via email at afola ... @yahoo.com or
oafol ... @afroam.umass.edu at their earliest convenience or by October
30, 2007. Thank you.

Also, Association of Nigerian authors, (ANA), Lagos, has also said it
will host the recent NLNG winners.

In a press release from the organisation whose new executive is led by
Mr. Chike Ofili, the group said it &quot;following on the heels of the just
concluded and appreciated NLNG Prize for creative writing jointly won
by two notable Lagos members of the Association of Nigerian Authors,
Ms Mabel Segun and Prof. Akachi Ezeigbo, the coming annual convention
of the association will also be throwing up new prize winners at the
Disney Hotel and Resort, Owerri, Imo State, venue of the ANA 2007
convention from Nov 1 - 4.

&quot;As part of the promise of the new Lagos ANA EXCO to celebrate these
their joint winners on sat. November 10 at the Art Gallery of the
National Theatre, Lagos, 2.30pm, since their joy was tampered with by
the unfortunate event that followed their day of celebration, ANA-
Lagos shall be making it up to them, whilst considering the topic:

'Do Literary Prizes Sharpen A Writer's Pen? &quot;

&quot;This event is intended to be an open house debate that is intended to
bring back the spirit of very lively discourse after writers would
have been back from ANA Owerri 2007,&quot; the statement said.

The Chike Ofili's led new Executive encourages writers to massively
turn up &quot;for this our annual pilgrimage&quot; He also pleads with &quot;absentee
and bonafide distancing members to join in the new direction being
fashioned by the new Lagos ANA EXCO.&quot;
