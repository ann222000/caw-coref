Non-Muslim students at Islamic school forced to wear headscarves

Female students at a new Islamic school will be made to wear head
scarves regardless of their religion, it was revealed yesterday.

The Madani High School in Leicester will be required by law to accept
10 per cent of its 600 pupils from a non-Muslim background.

But girls who are not Muslim will still have to abide by a rule
insisting all female pupils cover their heads as part of the uniform.

Assistant principal Zainab Elgaziari said he did not regard the demand
as a problem - despite the ongoing row over Muslim women's veils.

He said: 'I can't see why if a student wears a head scarf it should be
an issue. It's the same as a shirt or tie - it's just part of our
uniform.

'We will welcome students of other faiths. Indeed, there will be a
quota set down by the Government, and we will abide by these rules.

'When you go to any school you know what the uniform will be. Like any
school, we will have one - and in our case it will include a head
scarf.'

The secondary school, a voluntary-aided state academy, will replace the
city's existing Islamic Academy when it opens next September.

Yesterday Leicester City Council said it did not believe the scarves
would deter non-Muslim parents from sending children to the school.

Education spokesman Hussein Suleman, who is also a member of the
school's temporary governing body, said: 'We have to find a balance.

'Governors have to take into account the fact that 10 per cent can be
of a non-Muslim background and use discretion where appropriate.

'At the same time, parents have a right to send or not send their
children to this school. I hope discretion will be used if there are
any disagreements.'

The school, which is not expected to make boys cover their heads, was
also backed by Suleman Nagdi, of the Federation of Muslim
Organisations.

He said: 'All Islamic schools have certain criteria for school uniform.
I can't see anything different about the criteria they are setting in
this instance.'

I don't find this policy hypocritical. Parents and students know the
dress code in advance.

it's hypocritical because when public schools want muslims to remove
their scarfs and face masked they are called racists.  dress codes in
public schools don't apply to muslims because it's racists, but dress
codes in muslims schools against non muslims is not racist, it's just
the way it is.  britian will be another muslim state very shortly,
because they are giving in to the radical muslims at every turn.  get
the burkas and prayer rugs ready.

2 questions:

1. Why is the government requiring 10% to be non-Muslims to be
accepted, unless they are accepting government money, then ? this
muddies the waters just like school choice in the US.

2. If it is a purely private school, the scarf requirement is no
different than ties, knee socks, or plaid skirts.

In public schools, demographics will be different in different
locations. Administrators and the school board need to establish an
appropriate dress code. I can't see when face scarves are ever
acceptable in any public school. The kids can stay home if the parents
or students are insistent.

There may be cases of double standard relating to a particular group,
in this case Muslims. Funadamentalist Christian students in some US
southern schools are allowed latitude they would not be in other parts
of the country (the US Air Force for that matter) For the most part
this case  does not appear to be an example of that, despite the
rhetoric.
