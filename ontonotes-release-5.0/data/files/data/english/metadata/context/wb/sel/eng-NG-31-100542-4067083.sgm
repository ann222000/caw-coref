I'm looking for an used boxster S, 2000 or 2001 MK

Just one question about about depreciation.

Is it the marvellous one I can see in any car magazine? It seems to me that
every year a Porsche like the one I liked will cost me yust nothing compared
to any other car on the market (I live in Italy). If I bought for instance a
new Golf 2.0 TFSI and I presume to keep it for 5 years, it will cost me
3.600 euro per year (depreciation only) instead of  2.700 euro of an used
porsche S  MK 2000.
Is it really the trouth that Porsche will keep better value than any other
car in the market?

If some one likes to know my own way to calculate the depreciation of a car,
please contact me. I find the real percentage of depreciation controlling on
car magazines and on the internet prices of the the same model for any year,
and then I make the comparison with different years.

A 2000 Porsche value today is about 57% of a new one
A 1995  Porsche value today is about 39% of a new one.

So, if I buy an 2000 Boxster S used one today I pay more or less 32.000
euro; in 5 years it will be 21.900, less a fixed amount of 3.500 euro for
the dealer when you resell the car it means more or less 13.600 euro in 5
years (= 2.700 per year).

Ciao to everyone.

Any new cars will depreciate the most in the first year, then a little less
every year thereafter, so it's not a straightline if you are to draw a line.
For a Porsche, I would buy the latest model that I can afford, due to
incremental improvements they put into the car and not worrying too much
about depreciation, because life is too short!

I agree with you.

It was a question about numbers and not about the feeling a car like a
Porsche could give.
Anyway my next car will be a 2000 dark Boxster S, leather sand interiors and
so on and it will cost me...nothing compared to the satisfaction of owning
one! :))))) (smile)
