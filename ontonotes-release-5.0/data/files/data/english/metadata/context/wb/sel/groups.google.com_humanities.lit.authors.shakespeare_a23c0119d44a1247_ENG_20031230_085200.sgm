I watched the PBS documentaries on Rod Serling and John Nash last night.

Both men had supportive parents in childhood.

Both men were outspoken other than through their work.

Both men were talked about as much as they talked.

Both men actively sought the limelight.

Both men were highly disciplined in connection to their work.

(even after Nash came unglued, he continued churning out work,
though admittedly, nobody understood it)

Both men were recognized by their peers as geniuses in their own time.

Yrs, Christine

I wonder how many posters to HLAS have NOT, as adults, been called geniuses at
some time in their lives. It's be nice to have a rigorous definition of the
term. My not-so-rigorous definition would be &quot;one who is seen by the majority
of the educated to have been, at worst, one in a million as a significant
contributor to World Culture.&quot; By that standard, neither Serling nor Nash would
qualify.

While on the subject of Nash, I recently finally saw A Beautiful Mind (which I
much enjoyed). Was I the only HLASer who noticed how wonderfully Nash's
cryptanalysis matched the way so many anti-Stratfordians do their various kinds
of scholarship? Of course, he eventually recognized the irrationality of what
he was doing, so differed in that respect from the anti-Stratfordians I speak
of. And the latter, I'm sure, lacked his schizophrenia.

What's your source for that assertion? Thassalottawords.
Serling was slightly younger than my parents, and I'm pretty
sure they didn't have 25,000 word vocabs, even though having some college.

How do you know? How would anyone be able to guess how many words he had in his
active vocabulary, and how many in his passive? I suppose the latter would be
easy enough to figure out if you had a few weeks: you could go through the OED
and keep a count of how many words you recognized. Hey, I just decided I have a
passive vocabulary of 120,000 words: I opened a page at random in the OED, and
recognized 30 of the words on it. 30 times 4,000 pages equals 120,000 words.
(Actually, my small-print edition has 4089 pages of words. I should add that my
thirty include particles, etc. On the other hand, I know a lot of words the OED
doesn't have.)

Does anyone know how many words are in the OED?

Bob, the tale of it is that you have only about 18,000 words with your PhD
in Lit. as understood words that you could employ within a context (within a
sentence) unless you were a bibliophile understanding great chunks of
Anglo-Sax and a complier of dictionaries whereas you might have about 22,000

The author, by the same test, is assumed to have 30,000 words.

They last time I posted these statistics some wit suggested that
/undergrads/ [ROFL!!] had 70,000 words in English, whereas I submit as
active vocabulary they had 3,500, the rest [of 9,000] being 'passive.'

Another writer in this thread has mentioned John Nash, who had a very small
orbit of English, and, no doubt is mentioned only because of sexy Russel
Crow playing his part in the movie- yet his active expressional range is not
quite as the film portrayed it in a qualitative sense - especialy the nobel
acceptance speech, which was, scandalously undereported [miosreported, and
indeed 'invented'], and which in actuality constituted nothing more than an
anti-semitic diatribe.

There are those who will resent this idea, but who will not measure the fact
of the case.

Should you be an exceptionally person in using English language you may
score 20,000 words understood.

I found the statistic on a philology newsgroup. That figure
is recognition vocabulary, not the speaking vocabulary.
Objective tests can only measure word recognition. I was just
looking for the link--can't find it--and saw a reference to
the famed psychologist Eysenck who sets the college
graduate vocabulary at 50,000 words. That sounds about right
but it's not as impressive as it looks.

The problem is that while students are getting high SAT scores
they didn't acquire their vocabulary from reading but rather
from cramming for SAT tests, so they have no context. They
can define words but not use words.

Bacon was on top of this problem 400 years ago. Bacon
wrote that words had to be described by things, not defined by
other words or 'words chasing words' as he put it.

The first Elizabethan dictionaries were descriptive like an
encyclopedia entry. Now dictionaries are lists of synonyms
handy for cramming for the SAT test.

The astonishing thing about the author of the Shakespeare
works was that he acquired a *writing* vocabulary of 29,000
word forms (including compound words, and forms of words like
'gentry, gentleman, gentlewoman,' etc) before there were any
dictionaries or thesauri. I doubt anyone today has a 29,000
word form writing or speaking vocabulary. The only way that
an Elizabethan could even hear or see' that many words was if he
or she were raised in the educated aristocracy, attended the
university and had access to nearly everything then printed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thassalottawords.

"/>

If Eysenck is right the average college graduate still knows less
than a tenth of the English vocabulary but I doubt English had
29,000 words before the Shakespeare works were written.
Modern Spanish has about 45,000 words, iirc, modern Hebrew
about 42,000, most of them basically English. I doubt the
Elizabethan vocabulary had 20,000 if that. The author of the
Shakespeare works had to coin several thousand words '
englished' from Latin stems. It's really amazing how many words
we use on a daily basis that didn't exist before 1623. Abso

The philologists said the average college graduate has a 40,000-word
recognition vocabulary but Eysenck says 50,000. That's still less than
a tenth of the total English vocabulary.

I daresay that's an extreme generalization. I seem to recall getting 690

Unfortunately, I do not have my source to hand at the moment, and I fear

A pertinent datum for this discussion would be what percentage a writer's
working vocabulary is of all the words he's written. I figure I've used at
least three million words in my various writings (including diary entries,
letters, and so forth). It would seem strange to me if 99% of them were
repetitions of words I'd already used. On the other hand, not one word I've so
far used here is one I've never used before. . . .

What struck me as preposterous was the idea that one can ask a person what
degree he has and then check some kind of chart and find out how many words are
in his working vocabulary. I should think some lit Ph.D.'s must have very
large, some not-so-large, working vocabularies. If Shakespeare had a working
vocabulary of 30,000 words, I can't believe that a modern Ph.D. in literature
would not have at least that many working words in his vocabulary.

Thinking about the fact that I don't have that much trouble reading Shakespeare,
and therefore have a passive vocabulary of at least 29,000 words (his 30,000
minus no more than a thousand obsolete or technical words he used
since I've read all his works, just about), and that I read many books by other
authors, in other fields, without finding many words I don't know, and must
assume they've used a lot of words Shakespeare didn't--words unknown to his
time, for certain--I'd have to guess my passive vocabulary much larger than
28,000. I know also that I discuss some of the material I read, using
terminology from it, making it part of my working vocabulary. (Which brings up
a side issue: how big was Shakespeare's working vocabulary at any one
time--since one can know a word when writing text a, and not know it when later
writing text u.) I just don't see that I fail to use as many as half the words
I read--granted, that's just my subjective impression.

(I'm only a BA in lit, by the way, so must have, what--only 12,000 words in my
working vocabulary? And poor John W. Kennedy, whose lack of a degree I'm
intensely jealous of--does he even HAVE a working vocabulary?)

As for Shakespeare, I don't remember ever reading him and thinking, dang, this
guy shore knows a lotta wordz.

O, that's much older than usenet, and probably never appeared on-line. It
was a semiotic experiment which contrasted an intended message with a
received message - a sideline of which was an estimate of 'cultural
literacy' Umberto Eco seems to have been a force in its development - it
took such subjects as, example, the visual representation of a cow, and the
general responses from Europeans compared with Indian intellectuals -
Europeans seem to have have generally happy and bucolic association with the
countryside and supply of food, whereas the Indians seem to have observed
the image as a culturally repressive fetish, where hungry people allow cows
to freely eat at markets, and so on.

I would love to see some kind of study that showed how many words are used in
certain kinds of discussions. Actually, it chould be easy to use a sort program
on all of a given person's posts to, say, HLAS, and go through the list of
words, eliminating repeated words, and then do a word-count. I did that with
some plays of mine, but forget what figures I came up with, and seem to have
misplaced the old style disk I had the sort program on, and all my other old
style disks, which had a lot of correspondence and stuff on them. Anyway, when
I find my disks I'll at least sort some of my plays and maybe my diary, if it's
not too much trouble. I vaguely remember that the vocabulary revealed suggested
one of the order of Shakespeare's, which I think no big deal, but didn't take
the procedure far enough to be sure. I think I found 4,000 words in play #1,
and 3,000 words in play #2 different from any in play #1 and 3,000 in play #3
different from any in either of the other two plays, so decided each of my ten
full-length plays had 3,000 words in no other play. Or something like that.
But I well may be completely misremembering the whole thing. All I'm certain of
is that I didn't find anything to indicate I had a small working vocabulary
(although that wouldn't have bothered me much).

We've discussed Shakespeare's alleged neologies more than once at HLAS. I'm
fairly convinced he wasn't much of a neologizer, just a first-known user of
words. I wonder if there are any good books on neologizers. I suspect that
most of them are people in specialized kinds of verosophy (my word for

I've heard about such experiments or whatever--but what do they have to do with
size of vocabulary?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They last time I posted these statistics some wit suggested that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/undergrads/ [ROFL!!] had 70,000 words in English, whereas I submit as

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no idea how many words an undergrad has in his active
&gt;vocabulary,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can't believe it's only 3,500 words. That doesn't seem like many to
&gt;me.

&gt;It would be an interesting experiment to conduct - but where?

&gt;Cordially, Phil

"/>

Hmmm, on reflection I would say it might be easy: just a list of words asking
the test-taker to define them. No, make it a list of definitions asking for the
words defined. Administer 100,000 definitions to a thousand people, then use
the results to make a test using, say, a thousand of the definitions that the
percentage of which all the people first taking the test match correct words to
more or less equals the percentage of all 100,000 definitions they correctly
match words to.

One thing I'm curious about is whether or not people who have large visual
vocabularies necessarily have reduced verbal vocabularies. That is, are visual
thinkers less verbal than verbal thinkers. I also wonder if there's a limit on
vocabulary. Since people who know foreign languages must have double or triple,
etc., the vocabulary of people who know only their native language, it would
seem we have a huge amount of storage space available in our brains for words.

In short, interesting subject. . . .

There are a few of them, no? From Joyce who invented a new sort of

they had had themselves.

Yes. The other category of &quot;hard-wired&quot; types of information from cognitive
psychology is kinesthesia. I understand the statistical breakout of these
types in all the population to be:

Visual: 50%
Audio: 30%
Kinesthetic: 20%

The primarily Visual person will evoke picture images in their speech, and
become bored with only textual presentations, whereas the Audio type will
read (or better, listen to) every word offered and, if interupted in speech
(for example), will start over (!) whereas the Kinesthetic will actually
smell the paper its written on and may surreptiously nibble a corner. :)

That which the World call'd Wit in Shakespeare's Age,
Is laught at, as improper for our Stage.
/James Shirley, Love Tricks

The matter is that a variety of writers were also capable of similar verbal
genius, and the comparison confuses the witless. Chapman, Sir Thomas More,
John Milton, Gabriel Harvey, Michael Drayton, Joshua Sylvestrer, among other
contenders were equal word-wits.

Shakespeare was an immortal pilferer of other men's stories and ideas, 'with
his monstrous rhetorical fustian.&quot; That remark from Karl Holzknecht
neverthless lacks a perception of what the Author achieved with folk-work,
myth, and better. (Not unlike a musical appreciation fo what Shostakovitch
did with folk song, achieving from a rustic semitic tune, great art,
universal.

Holzknecht is psychologically clueless.

What the Author has done is render a poetic mythopaie, which differentiates
him from his verbal equals.

I agree 100%--or would if I didn't believe intelligence to be an organ. To take
this a little further, I define intelligence as effective (i.e., life-enhancing
or pleasure-maximizing, meaning by &quot;pleasure&quot; ALL pleasure, not just chocolates
and sex) functioning of organs. A person's brain is just where he stores the
results of his emotional reactions.

Note: thanks to this dolty thread, I now think about whether I'm using a word I
haven't before and thus revealing a wider working vocabulary every time I write
anything. The really bad thing is that I seem NEVER to use--utilize, I
mean--any new words. I suspect my working vocabulary at HLAS for 2004 is about
250 words. Verbal mechanisms. Expressive utilities. Visual lingual units.

&gt;There's also the problem, I understand, of the increased number of students

&gt;is the ratio of the number of kids' scoring high on the test to the number of
&gt;kids of the same age staying constant or changing?

I would think that the percentile rank rather than the raw score would
be more meaningful anyway, and allows you to compare the old test
to the new.

The SAT score isn't a &quot;raw score&quot;; it's the result of a standard

What poetry do you write Bob? Is it alliterative and sound-resonanced? Does
it sneak beneath the shield? Is it the writing of a man, not inculcated in

Bovine Famale Hormone....Hmm. Fascinating.

Do farmers give bovine female hormone to steers?
Why, to improve marbling, maybe?

Does that mean that REAL MEN don't eat hamburger,
which is where cows go?

Does that mean REAL MEN eat hotdogs, which is where bulls go?

&gt;much for people's perceptive skills determining narrative, no? How will they

&gt;~~~~~~~~

&gt;&gt;&gt;What poetry do you write Bob?

&gt;&gt; Many kinds. Go to  http://www.geocities.com/comprepoetica , my almost
&gt;entirely
&gt;&gt; comatose website. Some samples are there.

&gt;O - okay

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it alliterative and sound-resonanced?

&gt;&gt; The omnilexical, or purely-to-be-read, is, mostly.

&gt;Byattesque!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does it sneak beneath the shield?

&gt;&gt; You bedder buhlieve it.

&gt;K, budy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it the writing of a man, not inculcated in

&gt;&gt;&gt;does your poetry speak to a chess player, who, ... ha!

&gt;&gt;&gt;who sometimes describe themselves as raw-meat eaters in competition, and
&gt;at
&gt;&gt;&gt;other times describe the game as a ballet

&gt;&gt; I'm not a vegetarian but I think my poetry fairly strongly both masculine
&gt;and
&gt;&gt; feminine. My current stuff, almost all of it mathematical poetry, is
&gt;extremely
&gt;&gt; mathematical/analytical but also, in its sensual/anti-analytical texts and
&gt;&gt; graphics, quite feminine, I think.

I have. INteresting: though I don't read French, as soon as you said it was by
Rimbaud, it looked like it was to me. That is, it looks decadent. Maybe the
negativity suggested by ni and ne? Or maybe I just remember slightly the French
next to an English translation I read.

No time for me to talk, really, either. Will be back at work tomorrow--with all

Well Christine, no one here has made a self-joke or indulged in self-parodic

What IS an &quot;honorable&quot; way to murder someone? ;-)

Hey!

We could start a thread and take votes on who gets to die first!

An election, a la John Shakespeare?

P.S. I only learned how to lead one sheep at a time.
Maybe the art of leading by the flock was in Animal Husbandry 201?

Yah, lots of rice in Texas. We export it to Japan, I think.
Sugar's big, and there's a thriving industry in trophy deer,
up to $20,000.00 per SHOT. IOW, if you miss the buck,
you pay another twenty grand for another shot.
Texas is VERY strange.

Florida has lots of stuff besides tourists and oranges.
Our high school in Pompano was nicknamed &quot;beanpickers&quot;
by our football rivals, because of the migrant workers.
We were state champs often enough to give 'em the finger, tho ;-)

Your chicken-leading friend barks of Mr. Bean.
In England, that would entitle both yr friend AND his chickens
to march in parades together. The more eccentric, the merrier.
Sucks about Reynard, tho.

As for Mr. Nash, I only barely squeaked through first year calculus,
so I didn't get beyond first year physics and the one econ class,
which required differential equations,
so I'm not qualified to have an opinion.
His peers at Princeton claimed he was a genius, tho, so I defer.

Dear Shy Person Without a Name,

Try sometimes to talk with women.

Talking with men is more congenial, and you can have a nice fight! Then
stand proudly together and admire one another's wounds, talk of other
battles...

However, in addressing women, sly creatures that they are, they nevertheless
have a disconcerting habit of being more interesting to a man. Why is this?

Please do not bother to reply with ideas - I am not a person to honour them
particularly, if they have not sprung from the result of experience, and
even then I would prefer to understand something more masculine from a man,
which requires a stance of vulnerability, rather than its inverse.

Cordially, Phil.

&gt;&gt;and I have to tell you, there are even some

&gt;&gt;&gt; imtimidated by any such a being's existance and would rather take him
down a

&quot;Vicious&quot; is a strong word, Lynne, but I guess you're referring to the people
who demean Shakespeare without merit and then desert the discussion.
Yes, Lynne, the hit-and-run crowd are somewhat vicious, so we just
treat them with tough love. We ask them to verify and that at least
shows them that they have no good reason, even though they don't
often admit that they were wrong to demean Shakespeare in the first
place. But deep down, I think they always get the message.

Or maybe, Lynne, by &quot;vicious&quot; you are talking about people who would
form a society to defame Shakespeare, give his credit to Oxford without
any foundation, and then deny that they have any attachment to the idea!
Well, Lynne, those people are publicly hurting their own cause by
lying and trying to fit in, but they are lying to the very people they
are seeking acceptance from, so it all looks disingenuous. Yes, those
people are their own worst friends/enemies because they are walking
contradictions and cannot be taken seriously, even by themselves!

Then again, by &quot;vicious,&quot; it could be that you are speaking of a
person who would propagandize to children and fill their unsuspecting
minds with the wild idea that William Shakespeare was a drunkard,
which is an irresponsibly pathetic tactic and would damage rather than
build a child's understanding of the author. Well, Lynne, we can
only hope that the children don't take that person seriously and can
overcome the vicious, misleading lies being told to them by the
vicious liar. Children are smarter than the vicious deceiver thinks they
are, and it will ultimately teach children not to trust vicious people.

Or possibly when you call someone &quot;vicious,&quot; you are thinking about
a person who calls one of Shakespeare's daughters &quot;illiterate&quot; and when
asked to substantiate the slam on the poor girl, just abandons the
conversation, pleased to have insulted a Shakespeare daughter and
happier still to escape without justifying the vicious statement. Well,
Lynne, that person is the one exhibiting the reading deficiency, not
Judith or Susanna. Those vicious people are living a mean spirited
life and that is their own built-in consequence for lying about the
Shakespeares.

Wait... by &quot;vicious,&quot; you are probably speaking of a person who would
claim to send a package that then doesn't arrive, then ask to be informed if
it doesn't arrive, and then gloat about it. Well, Lynne we leave those
people to their own integrity. If the sender was at all proud of what was
sent, the sender would be sure to see that it arrived, not gloat that it
didn't. Maybe sending it would have been more vicious anyway.

Or come to think of it, the &quot;vicious&quot; people you are telling us about
are possibly the hypocrites who condone their own use of language they
condemn in others. Well Lynne, we can learn from such hypocrites
by not using our own websites to liken others to things we don't
want to be likened to ourselves, if it is so abhorrent.

But if these are not the &quot;vicious&quot; people you are telling us about, Lynne,
then please explain whatever it is you meant. You want to be understood,
don't you?

...Snipped the rest to give Lynne the floor so she could explain
in her own words what she found so vicious about people at
HLAS because I think HLAS is very tolerant of the vicious ones
and have always invited them (see this very post) to have their
say and possibly show that they are not so vicious after all. Lynne?

I don't think social skills or politics
are criteria for determining intellectual brilliance,
and it's probably a good thing,
or quite a few would have their laurels surgically removed.
Are you arguing that if he was THAT smart, he would have
reasoned better about people?
Genius is &quot;fringe&quot; by definition, and
appears to often co-exist with psychological mayhem,
I don't think I'd want to be one, myself.
Like I said, if his peers thought he was a genius,
how am I qualified to argue with them?
I don't think they liked him, either, and certainly pitied him,
but they gave intellectual credit where credit was due.

This is to some degree true, but if one wants to talk about Shakespeare in a

they do not discuss authorship, orders of the boss.

I see my attempts to write /as/ the voice of various writers has fallen a
bit flat, apart form the comedic one. The Dostoyevskyan effort was too
resolutely gloomy :( &lt;pout&gt; which was the intended effect, but...

And I probably shouldn't proceed to Henry Miller, not that we don't need it,
but that we wouldn't like it.

One interesting thing about the author is that he doesn't over-resolve any
issue by utilizng a single character - its hard to find consistent
characters in the Work who seem to hog any 'auto-biographical' role isn't
it? Or who carry the primary load of the narrative [Hamlet being the
greatest exception]

There is a great explanation of creative writing forces found in a Patrick
O'Brian novel. Maturin is wondering along a heath, late as usual to join the
ship, when he sees a figure ahead of him declaiming to the air, he
approaches unnoticed then startles the declaimer who nerverthless tells
immediately him that he is an author (!) and what he is doing is achieving a
certain level of realistic tension between his characters in the dialog, by
speaking their lines out loud - BUT - says the writer, not over-speaking
them, not over determing exact words, more arriving at an emotional
temperature between them. Do not, he tells Maturin, arrive at exact lines of
dialog, otherwise you rush home to write them down and the result is as flat
as a pancake.

I love this post, even though, yes, people on HLAS are vicious to
one another, and have been so to me and I to them... and you ALL
have smarted at one time or another under certain cruel comments
made by other HLAS posters, so don't let us pretend that we are
sweet and kind... HLAS posters are hardly ever KIND, and often
very unfair...but the viciousness of the anti-Strats towards one
Will Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon is indeed, well: vicious.
Also depraved, malicious, venomous, spiteful and malevolent, if

would he make characters in his plays out of them?

&gt;&gt; and have always invited them (see this very post) to have their
&gt;&gt; say and possibly show that they are not so vicious after all. Lynne?

&gt; I love this post, even though, yes, people on HLAS are vicious to
&gt; one another, and have been so to me and I to them... and you ALL
&gt; have smarted at one time or another under certain cruel comments
&gt; made by other HLAS posters, so don't let us pretend that we are
&gt; sweet and kind... HLAS posters are hardly ever KIND, and often
&gt; very unfair...but the viciousness of the anti-Strats towards one
&gt; Will Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon is indeed, well: vicious.
&gt; Also depraved, malicious, venomous, spiteful and malevolent, if
&gt; you get my drift. Were he alive, he might sue them all, but
&gt; would he make characters in his plays out of them?

Well, not all anti-Strats are vicious to
poor Will!...
(whip-poor-will??...
every whip-poor-will is selling me a bill
that's telling me it just ain't so...)
(Rodgers and Hammerstein)

I only wish him well, unless I find out
something *realllllly baddddd* about him!

***Why Roundtable, the two of us have dwelt here in uninterrupted
amity, methinks (and I take this opportunity to wish you the joy of
the season); so there is hope. As to the usability of anti-Strats in
the world of the arts, surely if a Hogarth in his art could give us
this

a Shakespeare could rise to such an occasion in his.

Best Wishes,
