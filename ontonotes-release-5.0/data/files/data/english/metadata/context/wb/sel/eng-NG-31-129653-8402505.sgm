As a UCD graduate I was extremely happy to see the plans to rejuvenate
the UCD campus. IT was a grey, bland concrete jungle - add rain and
you get a very dismal surrounding - not one which would inspire
learning or creativity.

There is a few lessons here I feel would be applicable outside of this
significant project,

- 6 storey building deemed &quot;landmark&quot; by this Private and Public
Partnership.
- Extensive green spaces are deemed necessary to facilitate positive
behaviour for young students
- Sustainable and renewable energies are being harnessed to run this
large campus - showing it is feasible to include green energy sources
in large projects
- underground car parks allowing the ground to be reclaimed for green
usages
- modern beauty of the buildings blend with the natural landscape

Maybe we could invite a similar approach be taken for all future
development as we build a new city in Tallaght.
