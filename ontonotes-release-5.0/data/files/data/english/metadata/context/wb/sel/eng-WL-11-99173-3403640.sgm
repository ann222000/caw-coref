it's the war queen hillary from isaiah's 'got war? ' for the world today just nuts . look, she's got her blood mustache and drops of blood drip from it.

kylie e-mailed to say it's the bully boy's illegal war but a lot of others got us over there and keep us over there. i agree completely and hillary clinton is 1 of the 1s who has the blood lust just like the bully boy.

it's people like hillary that keep us over there and that's worth remembering as year four of the illegal war begins and reality seems to fade. (check out c.i. for how the new york times invents false 'trends' to avoid covering reality in iraq.)

cedric thinks he just lost his whole post. he goes to post it and gets a message just as it is posting 'blogger is down.' they're down an awful lot considering that most of the bugs never get worked out.

wally's already noted that bully boy is now saying that the troops will remain in iraq long after the bully boy is gone. another case of him starting something he can't finish.

the associated press has this :

America risks convicting the innocent and letting the guilty evade justice in how it handles detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the military attorney defending an Australian terror suspect held at the U.S. prison camp said Monday.
Maj. Michael Mori, a Marine Corps lawyer, told an audience at George Washington University that no civilized justice system would accept "information being acquired potentially under torture or questionable methods."

are we finally in a place where we can listen and hear? i don't know. i hope the warning won't go unheeded but i know we've had so much fear instilled in us and so many lies that this could just fly right over a lot of heads.

but what's happening in guantanamo goes against democracy, against the consitution and stains every american.

here's something from the jerusalem post :

On Saturday, Feingold said that for him the censure was not just an important moral decision but a smart political move. He disdained other Democrats who have been afraid to take a stronger stance against the administration and who warned last week that Feingold's motion would play into the hands of Republican strategists, who would use it as a way to rally their own base around an embattled president.

and from the bbc :

US military investigators have flown to Iraq to study reports that marines shot dead at least 15 civilians, including seven women and three children.
The incident is said to have happened in Haditha on 19 November 2005.
The military's initial claim that the civilians died in a roadside blast was disproved by an earlier investigation.
Investigators will now ask if the civilians died in crossfire or were targeted deliberately in a potential war crime.

and here's this from the independent :

The US military is investigating two incidents in which American soldiers killed at least 26 Iraqi civilians and then claimed that they were either guerrillas or had died in cross fire.
The growing evidence of retaliatory killings of unarmed Iraqi families, often including children, by US soldiers seemingly bent on punishing Iraqis after an attack, will spark comparisons with the massacre of Vietnamese villagers at My Lai in 1968.
US troops have been notorious among Iraqis for their willingness to shoot any Iraqi they see in the aftermath of an insurgent attack. But it is only now that convincing and detailed information is becoming available about the killings.

good thing bully boy's so full of optimism, right? it would be awful if reality confronted him and he had to see the ugliness of the illegal war he forced on the world.

jesse jackson is attempting to get the election in new orleans postponed because there have not been adequate provisions to ensure that displaced people will be able to vote.

cedric lost 1/2 his post. i've just stayed in this window waiting for word that blogger is back up so i didn't lose anything by attempting to post.

i told him to forget it and i'd grab the section he lost.

okay, this is what he wanted to note from democracy now :

Historic Black Church Faces Closure in New Orleans
And in New Orleans, ten people barricaded themselves inside one of the country's oldest black Roman Catholic Churches Monday to protest its planned closure. Freed slaves founded the St. Augustine Church in 1841. The New Orleans Archdiocese plans to close it down as a cost-saving measure. We reached Cynthia Dolliole, who is among the ten people inside the church. She said: "We are just trying to get answers as to why they would close the oldest black church in the US when everyone in New Orleans has lost everything else and now we are trying to make us lose our church; we're very disappointed and hoping someone will hear us and we'll get better answers than what we've gotten before."

with all the scandals the catholic church has been through it shocks me that they're inviting a new 1. why does a chuch exist? i never counted the collection plate so i always assumed it was to provide a community with spiritual support.

can you think of a community that needs support now more than new orleans? but the church wants to pull out. (we can't pull out of iraq but the catholic church can pull a church out of an area where it's needed - logic 2006.)

with everything that has been lost what is the catholic church thinking when they decide that the community can also lose a church? it seems like a slap in the face to me.

they need to rethink that decision and they need to stay. a church should always be where it is needed and if they don't think they're needed in new orleans, they'd kidding themselves.

seth 's posted again so check him out. he's weighing in on when soaps go cowardly.
