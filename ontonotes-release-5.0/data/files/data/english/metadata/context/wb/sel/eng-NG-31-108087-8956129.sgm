I'm not a Geico insured, but as a fender-bender victim of
a Geico insured, I can relate information that is probably
much more meaningful.

After all, you might get 100's of reports that Geico is just
great. And, those reports might have come from those
that have never tested their claims process.

I'll bet by this time that you're thinkin' - &quot;Wow, this guy is
really gonna' rip Geico a new one&quot;.

Happily, at least for Geico, you'd be wrong. They handl-
ed our accident, caused by their insured, with the great-
est of ease, professionalism, punctuality, and care.

Well beyond any similar incident(s) with which I'd ever
been involved in the past, with other companies.

. We took our damaged vehicle to our local dealer for the
repair.
. We were given a complimentary/commensurate rental.
. The repair was flawless, the first time, and cannot even
be detected.

Of course, everyone's experiences differ. Our accident,
and damage, was relatively minor(crumpled left front
fender/lighting @ ~$1,000). And, the pristine condition
of our vehicle may have facilitated an easier paint match
than a vehicle faded from sun exposure for the last six
years.

But overall, we were extremely satisfied with the entire
experience(as satisfied as one can be after being hit by
someone running a stop sign).

Standard disclaimers apply:

I have no Geico connections. I do not insure with Geico
(although I've considered it after this experience). And
the statements are true to fact. The accident described
was in Texas. And, the cavemen are generally my favo-
rite Geico commercial.

This accident involved two cars. No motorcycles were
involved.

If you have Geico...  Ask them about roadside assistance and/or towing
coverage.  I think mine is like $4 a year or something...  That's really
inexpensive compared to AAA, etc.

Not sure if it's still their policy, but Geico donates radar detectors
to police departments so the police can ticket more so Geico can raise
your rates more.

They're higher than my current homeowners and auto insurance, but not by

Saved about $530. I did speak to a human to verify that I was comparing

I went to GEICO about 30 years ago after seeing an add saying they were
Government Employees Insurance Co and offering discounts to government

asked if they gave discounts to government employees, and they replied,
&quot;no&quot;.

I haven't had a reason to go back as Allstate has been good to me on my

Typical.

What really annoys me are companies that rip of soldiers.  Geico used to
advertise heavily to the military, seemingly targeting the kids (young
soldiers straight out of boot).  As amusing as their commercials are today,
I wouldn't give them my business just out of principle.

H&amp;R Block used to do this too.  They'd charge $100 to do taxes of single
soldiers, using a complicated computerized form when the 1040EZ was
practically done for them on the W2.  The only 'benifit' their customers got
was getting their refund a week sooner, but H&amp;R wouldn't even bother telling
them they'd be better off NOT getting a 'big' refund and should adjust their
pay.  No tax advice, no real work done, and they still wanted $100.  This
was back in 1994, so their prices have probably gone up.

I've seen several companies trying the same with government employees.
Retirement scams, savings scams, job listing scams, they're all out there.
There's even a scam web site targeting users of GSA's newish online service
who mistakenly type .com instead of .gov.

Doesn't Allstate give you a good price on your bike?  I haven't insured mine
yet, mainly because it's not registered or running well yet, but I was just

Insurance companies don't want claims. If you are claimless the love

&gt;&gt; I haven't had a reason to go back as Allstate has been good to me on my
&gt;&gt; cars.  I have Progressive for my bikes but haven't had an opportunity
&gt;&gt; to use them yet so I don't know how they'll treat me.

&gt; Doesn't Allstate give you a good price on your bike?  I haven't insured
&gt; mine yet, mainly because it's not registered or running well yet, but I
&gt; was just going to add it on to my Allstate policy.  Never dealt with
&gt; Progressive.
">

Here's the short version -
I insured my cages with Allstate and my home with State Farm.  After an
arrogant and racist Allstate insurance claims rep abandonned and then
abused my brother in-law (he had to make use of his uninsured motorist
coverage after being rear ended) I checked into moving my vehicles to
another firm but found it would cost me $600/yr so I stayed with them.

When I returned to riding, Allstate said my 1992 Nighthawk was a crotch
rocket (I know) and wouldn't insure it so I discovered Progressive.

Later, State Farm wanted to double their rates when I changed homes so I
insured with Allstate to get a multiple policy discount, only to find they
cancelled the policy one day after closing due to a tree limb hanging over
the roof.  My agent explained they would reinstate it just as soon as I
cut the limb, but I found Morgan Stanley instead and cut the limb any way
as I had always intended to do anyway.

I've had cage insurance with Allstate for about 28 years.  They've treated
me well, but they don't get my home or bikes (I no longer have the crotch
rocket :&gt;).  On the one hand I feel I'm wasting money merely because of my
feelings of guilt for not doing a better job of helping my brother in-law
(who died of a heart attack during that whole thing), but then I'm also
genuinely angry over the treatment he received.  I should really get over
this desire for revenge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, hope you never find out how Progressive treats you. heh

I hear you, and thanks.  Same to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just wondering since I just switched... I know it's really too late
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to ask, but any problems?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Years ago when I was in the military I called them up for a quote,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which ended up being twice what I was already paying.  I told them so,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and that I wasn't interested.  Their response, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought they were trying to be funny, but they called me back
&gt;&gt;&gt; several times to try again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your saving money, that's great, but these folks aren't too bright.

&gt;&gt; I went to GEICO about 30 years ago after seeing an add saying they were
&gt;&gt; Government Employees Insurance Co and offering discounts to government
&gt;&gt; employees.  I dropped by their office, got a quote that was somewhat
&gt;&gt; high, asked if they gave discounts to government employees, and they
&gt;&gt; replied, &quot;no&quot;.

&gt; Typical.

&gt; What really annoys me are companies that rip of soldiers.  Geico used to
&gt; advertise heavily to the military, seemingly targeting the kids (young
&gt; soldiers straight out of boot).  As amusing as their commercials are
&gt; today, I wouldn't give them my business just out of principle.
">

Yes, many businesses focus on taking advantage of the un-informed, and
many soldiers are just young kids (some of them still in their teens)
still learning about life.  A brother in-law asked my advice about
inviting a relative to come to America, so I downloaded the immigration
form from the net and sent it to him, along with some hopefully helpfull
instructions.  He later told me a company had quoted him a $1000 fee to
file for him.  All you have to do is fill out that form and mail it in to
INS.  It takes an hour, max.  (The person in question didn't immigrate
after all as the Sibling From Korea list was 10 years long).

Perhaps, I really don't know. But, it reeks of urban legend
to me. And, to address your claim of GPF donations dir-
ected at various/numerous organizations, I won't argue
that either. It's one thing to donate funds, another to use
gadgets/raw equipment/&quot;radar detectors&quot;.

My only challenge is that actual donations are in the form
of radar detectors. Perhaps so, but I doubt that anyone
will ever stand up with definitive confirmation.

I see this all over the place but I've found no solid confirmation,
it's always someone making an assertion in a forum or blog, it's never
a newspaper article or press release.

The only thing that can be confirmed is that Geico (as of 1/24/02
anyway) owns a six percent share of Laser Technology Incorporated,
which makes laser guns.

I've heard this many times over the years but obviously Geico
doesn't admit to funding speed traps in their ads.

However, it's certainly plausible that Geico could contribute
money to police departments, on the condition that it be spent
on radar equipment.  I am sure very few PDs would baulk at taking
money for that purpose from a 'safety-minded' insurance company.
It would be all above board and not subject to criticism, except
from dirty stinking lawbreaking speeders, of course.

That sort of rip-off has been around forever, and is still quite popular.

I got an unsolicited business letter last year, informing me that the State
of California was holding property that had belonged to my deceased mother,
and offering to file the recovery paperwork for me for a mere thousand
dollars  -with no guarantee of recovery. Upon checking out the State website
I discovered that the State did indeed have four thousand dollars plus that
had not shown up on mom's declared assets at the time of her death, so I
filed a unassisted claim for same, following the instructions on the
website.

Turned out that the State needed *exactly* the same paperwork that the
company had asked for, but the State asked exactly *nothing* for doing what
the company wanted $1,000 for...

One little bureaucratic nightmare *did* ensue: the State of California
changed the requirements for filing such a request between the time I had
filed and the time they finally got around to processing my papers -six
months later........meaning that they sent the whole package back to me for
one more form, and then took *another* six months before they finally
reprocessed the whole works and eventually -grudgingly- sent me the check.

(BTW: note that the State will generally make no attempt to contact *you*
and tell you about any funds in their possession that might belong to you.
It's all left up to the survivors because the State would much rather that
you didn't claim it and they got to keep it.
It's worth checking into.)

On the other hand, it maybe a good idea.  My experience with
police is if they see you speeding and don't have a radar gun handy
they are still going to pull you over and cite you - but, they will
make the speed determination using the most arbitrary and
rediculous reasoning imaginable, and cops are notorious for
estimating high.  If they see you speeding at 5 MPH over the
limit the cop will write down 15MPH.  The radar gun at least
prevents the cop from doing this - as the accused can always
demand the receipt from the gun.

The best way has always been to be alert.  I know when I'm not
as alert as I should be - in the morning commute with all the other
waking dead for example - and I have got in the habit of riding like
an old grandmaw during those times.  When I'm fully alert, I speed,
and I always see the cops miles away in advance.
