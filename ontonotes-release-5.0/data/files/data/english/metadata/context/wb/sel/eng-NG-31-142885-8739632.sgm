A history of Makkah

History informs us about what happened during specific points in the
past as well as events that have taken place over time and gives us
information related to this. Such information may be true or false,
and every Muslim is obliged to seek the truth and confirm any
information he hears so that he may ascertain what is correct from
what is fabricated. Moreover, every Muslim should refer to reliable
sources in order to obtain definite, authentic and verifiable
information.

Makkah is the Sacred City as well as the holiest and the absolutely
most honourable place on earth. The most truthful sources from which
one can take news about its history are the Noble Qur'aan and the
authentic prophetic narrations in this regard, and from these we can
ascertain its ancient history as well as how it was prior the message
and prophethood of Muhammad.

After the advent of Islaam, Muslim scholars and historians have
endeavoured to record chronicles of Makkah in general history books as
well as books concerned with the biographies of the Muslim scholars
who lived in it. Some scholars authored books that dealt primarily
with its history and the areas surrounding it, one of the most famous
being &quot;Chronicles of Makkah and its Ancient Monuments&quot; authored by Abu
Al-Waleed Al-Azraqi  from the third century AH. Another book was
&quot;Chronicles of Makkah in Ancient and Contemporary Times&quot; authored by
Al-Faakihi  who also lived during the third century AH, and his book
was larger than that written by Al-Azraqi  but the initial parts of
his book were lost over time.

Thereafter, chronicling the affairs and events of Makkah ceased for a
period of almost four centuries. It was thereafter resumed and one of
the scholars who is considered to be the most prolific author
regarding it and its history was Imaam Taqiyyud-Deen Al-Faasi Al-
Makki  (775 AH - 832 AH). In his book entitled &quot;The Therapy for those
who Harbour Affection for the History of the Sacred City&quot;, Imaam
Taqiyyud-Deen  expressed his amazement at the fact that chronicling
the history of Makkah had halted after Imaams Al-Azraqi and Al-
Faakihi.

This incited him to write many publications on the history of Makkah
that took different sizes; large, medium and small. One of the largest
books he authored was &quot;The Treasured Necklace on the History of the
Secure City&quot; which consisted of eight volumes. Next in size came &quot;The
Therapy for those who Harbour Affection for the History of the Sacred
City&quot; which consisted of two volumes, which he later summarised in
books such as &quot;The Gift for the Honourable on the History of the
Sacred City&quot; and others.

Thereafter, many scholars and schools of history arose which
contributed to the writing of the history and chronicles of Makkah
such as, Aal Fahd and Aal At-Tabari, and this has continued ever
since, to include the contemporary.

The establishment of Makkah

The history and building of Makkah is directly connected to Prophet
Ibraaheem  as he was the first person to settle his family in it when
he left his wife Haajar and his son Ismaa'eel  there in compliance
with the command of Allaah for him to do so.

Imaam Al-Bukhaari  reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbaas  in the
long narration in which the Prophet  informed us that Ibraaheem  once
came with his wife Haajar and his son Ismaa'eel  who was still a
suckling infant, from ancient Syria to Makkah. At that time, Makkah
had no water and nobody residing in it. Ibraaheem  took them both
under the shade of a tree and left with them a bag of dates and a
flask of water, then headed back to ancient Syria. As he was leaving,
his wife Haajar called to him, saying: &quot;Where are you going? How can
you leave us in this deserted valley that has neither humans nor
anything else (in terms of life)?&quot; She repeated this a few times but
he did not reply, so she asked: &quot;Did Allaah command you to do this?&quot;
Ibraaheem  replied: &quot;Yes&quot; Thereupon she said: &quot;Then He shall never
forsake us&quot;.

Ibraaheem  walked for a while and then stood upon a small hill, raised
his hands in supplication, and said, as Allaah informs us (what
means):  &quot;Our Lord! I have settled some of my descendants in an
uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may
establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them
and provide for them from the fruits that they might be
grateful.&quot; [Quran 14: 37]

Allaah blessed Haajar and her son with the well of Zamzam, and then
people came from all directions and resided in Makkah. The first tribe
to reside there was the tribe of Jurhum among whom Ismaa'eel  grew up
and from whom he married.

Ibraaheem  came many times to Makkah to check upon their condition,
and later Allaah commanded him to build the Ka'bah; Allaah Says( what
means):

&quot;And [mention] when Ibraaheem (Abraham) was raising the foundations of
the House and [with him] Ismaa'eel (Ishmael), [saying]: 'Our Lord!
Accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the
Knowing.'&quot; [Quran 2: 127]

Allaah also Says (what means): &quot;And [O Muhammad], when We designated
for Ibraaheem (Abraham) the site of the House, [saying] &quot;Do not
associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform
Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Ka'bah) and those who stand [in
prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.&quot; [Quran 22: 26]

Ibn Katheer  said commenting upon this verse in his famous book of
history entitled &quot;The Beginning and the End&quot; in Volume 1, page 135:
&quot;There is no authentic report from the infallible (i.e. Prophet
Muhammad ) informing us that the House (the Ka'bah) was built before
Ibraaheem  and whoever states that, relying upon this verse (for
evidence of that), has no basis for such a claim because what is meant
by the verse is that he was simply being informed of where the House
was to be built.&quot; In Volume 2 page 227 of the same book, he said: &quot;The
verses of the Qur'aan clearly indicate that Ibraaheem was the first
person to build it.&quot;

Abu Tharr  narrated: &quot;I asked the messenger of Allaah: `O messenger of
Allaah! Which mosque was the first built on earth?` He  replied: &quot;The
Sacred Mosque (in Makkah)&quot; &quot;I then asked: ` Which mosque was built
next?` He  said: &quot;The Aqsaa mosque (in Jerusalem).&quot; &quot;Thereupon, I
asked: `What was the period between the building of the two mosques?`
He  replied: &quot;Forty years.&quot;&quot; [Al-Bukhaari]

These reports clearly highlight the virtue of Prophet Ibraaheem  and
confirm that he was the one who built the two mosques, and that the
period between the two was forty years.

Therefore, it becomes evident that the first thing to be established
in Makkah was the Sacred Mosque (i.e. the Ka'bah), and that the first
water to gush forth from it was Zamzam.

Thereafter, the offspring of Ismaa'eel  multiplied in the area of
Hijaaz (the province in which Makkah lies) and its surroundings, and
their families succeeded each other in caring for the Sacred House and
maintaining it for a long period of time, until the tribe of Khuzaa'ah
took over this responsibility. People remained upon the monotheism
with which Prophet Ibraaheem  came until the time when, 'Amr bin Lahy
Al-Khuzaa'i introduced idol worshipping in the Ka'bah.

The number of idols then increased in the Ka'bah and this phenomena
spread all around the Arabian Peninsula to the extent that the number
of idols in the Ka'bah reached three hundred and sixty, as stated by
Al-Kalbi in his book &quot;The Idols&quot;.

Due to numerous wars and tribal struggles, the well of Zamzam was
buried and people could no longer find it. Qusay bin Kilaab, a great-
grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad  forcefully took over the custody
of caring for the Sacred House and maintaining it from the tribe of
Khuzaa'ah, as it had abused its authority. Qusay gathered the
scattered families of the Quraysh tribe, relocated them in Makkah, and
restored the sanctity of Makkah, which had been lost due to
Khuzaa'ah's misuse of  authority and because some of the Quraysh tribe
had been placed in the surrounding areas of Makkah in order to protect
it.

This marked the beginning of an authority that glorified Makkah and
which freely offered all types of services to its visitors, such as
food, water and the cleaning and maintaining of the Ka'bah.

After 'Abdul-Muttalib saw a dream in which he saw the exact spot of
the buried well of Zamzam, he had the area dug up and restored the
well. Thus, the well of Zamzam once again became the source of water
to the pilgrims and visitors, as well as to the residents of Makkah.

After this, a grave event took place during the time of 'Abdul-
Muttalib when Abrahah the Ethiopian headed towards Makkah riding a
huge elephant in order to demolish the Ka'bah. This is why that year
came to be known as &quot;The Year of the Elephant&quot;, during which the
Prophet  was born.

A city with such a magnificent history is worthy of having such an
exalted status and should, therefore, be glorified and honoured. It
deserves to occupy a special place in the hearts of its residents, as
well as the Muslims in general.
