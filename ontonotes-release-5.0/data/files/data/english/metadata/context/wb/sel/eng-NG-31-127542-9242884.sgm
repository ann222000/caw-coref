My Analysis
I think this company is a &quot;Hiddem Germ&quot; and yet to be discovered!!

Below are my points;
Today PPerdana PE Ration at 12 and Construction average at 18, while
IJM, Gamuda, WCT, Muhibbah and etc average 25 and above, PPerdana,
very big potential............. Reasons; earning going to double to
RM90Million in 2008 and not inclusive of project from IDR + Middle
east.  IDR and Middle east itself easily another RM2Billion
revenue(conservative figure), I think can hit RM3Billion.  Assuming
RM2Billion and net around 6%, profit will be at RM120million.
Therefore RM90million + RM120million = RM210million, then divided by
share capital(135,085,000) = RM1.55 per share, then X average PE ratio
of 18 = RM28 ringgit.

Am I sound ridiculous, I'm not such, but based upon facts and figures,
that the price I can come out.  Believe or not is up to you all....
RM28 is a bit high, but how about RM14, half the amount, still not,
another half will be RM7, and I think definitely achievable in short
term, while long term RM14 - RM20 no problem.  Still not believing ask
any analysis, is my calculation right or wrong!!

The Star, NST September 28, 2007

Order book to swell. Current order book at RM1.3billion, tendering
RM2billion, not including IDR and oversea.  As I said earlier,
PPerdana already signed MOU with Aldar, infrastructure cost for IDR
going to be a few billion.  Oversea project will also come due to good
connection with Middle Eastern.

Management target RM3.4billion in order book easily achievable, so
below is my calculation for 2008

No. of Share 135,085,000
Year 2008 Revenue Estimated at about RM1.1billlion
Net Profit Estimated around RM70million
Therefore Earning Per Share will be around RM0.51
(70,000,000/135,085,000)
Average Industry PE = 18+ conservative figure (IJM PE=21, Gamuda
PE=39, MRCB PE=59, Mudajaya PE=29,Muhibah PE=39, UEMWorld PE=43, WCT
PE=25.2, Zelan PE=43)

RM0.51 x 18 = RM9.18

A Gaint in Making and a Germ Yet to be Discovered!!!!!!!!!

Middle East Investors Start Work on US$1.2 BLN Malaysian Idr Project
JOHOR BAHARU (Malaysia), Oct 2 Asia Pulse - The four Middle East
companies which announced their intention to invest US$1.2 billion
(RM4.1 billion) in the Iskandar Development Region (IDR) recently have
appointed an architect and master planner to kick off the project,
Najib Tun Razak said Monday.

He was told this by the head of Mubadala Development Company, one of
the four, in a telephone conversation two days ago, the Deputy Prime
Minister said at a breaking of fast at the residence of Johor Menteri
Besar Abdul Ghani Othman here.

Last Aug 29, Mubadala and Millennium International Company, a
subsidiary of Saraya Holdings, and Kuwait Finance House (KFH) signed
an agreement with the coordinator of IDR's development, South Johor
Investment Corporation (SJIC), to invest in the special economic
region.

Another Gulf firm, Aldar Properties PJSC, will manage the project,
which will be IDR's first integrated international city, identified as
Node I. This encompasses more than 892ha in Nusajaya, including the
state government's new administrative centre and the Second Link to
Singapore.

Mubadala, KFH and Millennium Development head their own consortiums
and are collectively investing the US$1.2 billion for land cost and
infrastructure work to develop three clusters under lifestyle and
leisure, cultural and financial.

This is the largest single investment so far since the IDR was
launched by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in November last
year.

Najib, who is also Deputy Umno President and Defence Minister,
welcomed the investment kick-off by the four companies, describing it
as very good and positive.

He expressed confidence that IDR, which spans 2,217 sq km and is twice
the size of Singapore, will draw even more investments from the Middle
East
