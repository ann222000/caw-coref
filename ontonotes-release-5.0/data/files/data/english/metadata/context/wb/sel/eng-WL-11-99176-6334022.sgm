Iraqi weapons sites were looted - but what does it mean?
The story of the looting of Iraqi weapons sites, which is not a new story , is once again in the news (with more details): "In the weeks after Baghdad fell in April 2003, looters systematically dismantled and removed tons of machinery from Saddam Hussein's most important weapons installations, including some with high-precision equipment capable of making parts for nuclear arms, a senior Iraqi official said this week in the government's first extensive comments on the looting.

"Dr. Araji's statements came just a week after a United Nations agency disclosed that approximately 90 important sites in Iraq had been looted or razed in that period." But commentators in the mainstream/corporate press seem to take this as more evidence of Bush administration incompetence, or just reflective of "the chaotic months after the invasion." But it's much more than that, as I first wrote in September 2003 : "If you did go to war because you thought there were WMD which might find their way into the hands of terrorists (the ostensible purpose for the war, since it was 100% clear that Iraq itself had no way of attacking the U.S. with any weapons at all), then you would have spent months preparing for an immediate, massive effort to seize them and prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists. Instead, we saw a decidedly lackadaisical search, with known nuclear facilities left unguarded, teams not even ready to go for months after the fall of Baghdad, etc." To repeat the conclusion -- the invasion of Iraq was never about WMD, and even if the media and John Kerry and other leading Democrats and a healthy percentage of the American public believed the lies, the Bush administration never did.

Araji is making a habit of spreading Centcom lies.

This cover story attempts (probably succeeds) to change the down story of 90 looted sites (a direct result of Don and George's undermanning of the invasion, and failure to write any orders to guard the sites -- a key component), into another bogus WMD rumor.

They're slick, the bastards.

Btw, Al Gore predicted and warned of the spread of WMD from any invasion in Sept. 02.

The idea that Kerry believed that WMD was the issue is not necessarily a given. He outed the USPNAC airbase installation during the first debate, and repudiated it, to the resounding SILENCE of the left-wing press, who had already decided he was a supporter of the invasion, because of the 25-25 split the political risk vote in the Senate.
