I've just started sighting in an air rifle  and I think I've read
enough of the basics to get it done correctly.

However, one the things I'm wondering about are  the tradeoffs of
adjusting the height of the sight at the front or the back.  My
googling hasn't found an answer on this one so here goes:

Of course the standard way to do this is the adjustable rear sight.
However, in my air rifle case the front site is one of those ring
cylinder sights with the replaceable appertures.  So if I want to raise
my point of impact I could either raise the rear adjustable sight or I
could replace that front apperture with one that sticks up less.  It
would seem to me that I would be better off with a front sight that
sticks up the minimum ammount since I would think that it would reduce
parallax error.  There must be a flaw in that argument as I notice that
most of iron sights on target rifles  sit up quite high on the end of
the barrel.  What is the reason for that?  Easier to align your eyeball
vision line of sight, or something like that?  Parallax not really an
issue?

The other  reason for asking is that currently on this air rifle to get
the point of impact right I have to raise that rear sight up quite a
bit.  It sticks up so high that I can't help but feel like it will  get
hung on objects  or a rifle case and potentially mess up the setting
during handling.

If someone has a url that explains this aspect please point me in that
direction.

tks
Don

Sounds to me like you've already figured it out. Lower the front sight
so you can get your rear sight into a reasonable adjustment range.

A) you can adjust your sites in either way you describe above. Most
people just diddle with the adjustment instead of diddling with the
post.
B) paralax is an optical phenomonom that happens in scopes, but does
not happen in iron sites. Paralax happens when the reticule is not at
the exact focal point of the objective (First focal plane scope) or is
not at the exact focal point of the erector lens group (second focal
plane scopes.) This sets up a situation where the image may be in crisp
focus, but the reticule is not; and thereby, when you move your eye
around in the exit pupil of the scope the reticule moves around.
C) the height of the sites over the rifle barrel changes your view of
the trajectory of the projectile. But a couple of millimeters of change
(what you describe above) is irrelevent, while an inch of change (what
happens when you mount a scope) is relevent and noticible.

Suggest you put the rear sight at the center of its normal range of
adjustment, then modify the height of your front sight to achieve a bullseye
at your most frequently shot distance.  That will let you make rear sight
adjustments easily if you change distances in the future.

Don,

I believe you will find that all your front apertures are 'centered`.

If you want to modify the sight line height above bore line, you can
of course make a shorter post insert, but consider that for a low
velocity
gun, the curve of the trajectory gives you a better 'match` over a
longer
set of ranges with the higher sight line.
If you cross the sight line at say 10 Meters, your pellet may fall
back into
the line at say 15-20 meters not rising too far in the interum.-
(Numbers are a guess)
It's a lot easier to accurately hold 'under` than 'over`.

Best of luck,
MadDog

tks Maddog,
I see now what you are saying about the sight line.  The higher site
will help account for that inevitable droop.  I think I mentioned that
this is a pellet gun albeit a a medium performer at 750fps or so.  That
helps to explain that tall sight in the front.  The deal was that  most
of my experience is  with with shotguns and old fashioned 22's this
tall thing sticking up in front just seemed kind of odd.  Obviously, I
have a lot more to learn.

The other wierd deal is that the sight sticking up is rather wide.
LIke I said that must be to discourage you from thinking that it has a
fine point of accuracy/repeatability.  Neverhteless, I'd like something
more pointed out there on the end.  I guess I could just trim it.

tks for tolerating my newbie questions you gun gurus out there.

best regards
Don

On my AR-15 the front post is about 3x as wide as the bullseye at the
200 and 300 yard line. I haven't had the opportunity to shoot further.
By putting the center of the top of the front post where the bull is
the widest, works best for me. Since I'm shooting service rifle, I do
not  have a lot of different front sight choices. I'm sticking with the
wider front post because it is easier to see in low light conditions.
The range where I have been shooting most is a 200 yard reduced range
near Saint Johnsbury, Vermont. There is hazy fog early in the morning
and the sun only rises above the mountain and hits the targets near
1100 in the morning.

I'm shooting about 95% at 200 yards. Not too many Xs though. New year's
resolution is to practice more.
