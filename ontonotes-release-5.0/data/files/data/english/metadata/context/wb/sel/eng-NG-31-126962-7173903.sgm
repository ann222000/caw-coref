I would like to bring your attention to an on line  training
opportunity for people passionate of writing and translations. It is
an unique opportunity to get your own byline and express yourself as a
writer. For detailed information read further...

The Foundry is an advanced training center based in Pau, France. It's
purpose is to provide real-life business experience for talents around
the world (we have welcomed students from over 50 countries in the
world !). The training is primarily focused on leadership following
best-of-practice methodologies such as Fifth Discipline, 6 Sigma,
Extreme Programming among others. All these methodologies are well
known in top universities around the world and we believe should be
taught to all talents that want to succeed in a global world.

Regarding the founders, Christopher M. Cantell and Frédéric Artru have
proven, throughout their careers, their ability to attract talented
teams, technologies and capital around fundamental ideas. They have
constantly shown their willingness to adapt to changes in their
environment and most importantly their capacity to succeed. Chris and
Frédéric have demonstrated expertise in the technology, marketing and
financial subjects they are implementing, and their diverse
experiences have allowed them to test, develop, evaluate and validate
their methodologies and techniques.

Frédéric Artru has posted a personal blog to give his view of the
Foundry. You can view it at http://frederic-artru.blogspot.com
