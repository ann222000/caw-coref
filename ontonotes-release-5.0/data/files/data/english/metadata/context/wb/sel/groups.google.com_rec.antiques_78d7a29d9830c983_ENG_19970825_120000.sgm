Ronnie, I was all ready to tell that person looking for the desk to go
to estate sales until I realized it was you ! You have a great

I already see the FAQs, so if 2, 3 or 4 group members wish to repost
their own variation, please at least keep them all within the one
thread.

How about making 100s of discussion post to r.a maybe then the errant
posters may see that this is indeed a real discussion group.

Note, I said robo-moderation &quot;could&quot; be used, but you're probably
right about it being more &quot;acceptable&quot; to some folks than human(s)
physically approving each post...but, it would automatically kill
messages like the innocent one Ronnie created and it would be subject
to the old GIGO rules.

Actually, I was wrong about the only real solution being moderation.
Those of us who think ads belong in r.a.m could abandon rec.antiques
as many former subscribers have already done...or are we too stubborn?

Where has LeAnne Davis been hiding ? She is not new to rec.antiques
and must know that have already _had_ an official RFD ( Request For
Discussion ) to create &quot;rec.antiques.moderated&quot; and rename
rec.antiques --&gt; rec.antiques.misc to catch all the junk, rejected by
the moderator of the moderated group, in the new *.misc subgroup. :-(

After fierce opposition that RFD was withdrawn by its proposer.

Robomoderation is a cop-out to try to lull people into thinking
it is not moderation. It _is_ moderation by a human-controlled robot.
The Robot is merely a tool of the human moderator(s).

&lt;sigh&gt; How many times do we have to go through this moderation
business ?

"/> Amen to both points. With more new users logging on by the minute,
trying to rein in this runaway horse called Usenet will be more and
more impossible. A few years ago, when more Internetizens were
paying for their services according to time logged in/disk space
used, the whines about misposting got a lot more sympathy from me.
Today, when almost anywhere you live (at least in the USA), you
can find a provider that charges a flat monthly rate, I think the
continued complaints about misposting are just a habit. :)

No offense to anyone who is annoyed by for sale ads and the like,
but why not just skip them? I know, I know, some of them are
disguised as reputable, upstanding, bonafide r.a posts, but I
think you can get pretty good at separating the chaff from the
wheat with a little practice.

this, I could retire and buy myself that little antique shop I've

here I am, adding my two cents again. Could it be that we collectors
enjoy talking about these extraneous issues as much as we like to
discuss antiques? Or could it be that since our collecting
tastes are so varied, this is the only subject we consistently
have in common? :)

I have suddenly realised where I had seen LeAnne Davis's name
very recently.

Bingo...here it is...

Note that she does not call for a moderated newsgroup in the same
way as for rec.antiques. Interesting ?

If you think that you problems now,just wait. I, and millions like me
that are computer illiterate will be online in the next 12 months via
WEB TV or a similar product. Web TV has only been available less than 1
year and has over 100,000
subscribers. Now that Bill Gates has purchased WEB TV sales will
probably skyrocket and there are 7 new makers of a product just like WEB
TV that hooks up to ones tv. At least previously a person had to be
somewhat on the ball just to operate a computer to mispost to this ng.
Now, anyone with $300 can surf the web and make the error of FS/WTB to
this group. Don't take this lightly,but plan ahead. I'm not for a
moderated group either, but watch out for what's coming. I've seen
fellow Webbies in other ng's and it isn't pretty, IMO.

Hey Doug - How dare you make disparaging remarks about Web TV users.
You and I both use Web TV and we have managed to find our way around
this ng. And plenty of people with &quot;systems&quot; blow it. Just because
someone spends $300 to get on the net instead of $3000 that doesn't make
them stupid. Hmmm.....a saving of $2700 - makes 'em sound pretty smart
to me. Carol
