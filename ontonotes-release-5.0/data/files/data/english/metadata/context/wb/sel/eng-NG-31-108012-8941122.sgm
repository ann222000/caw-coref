&gt; I haven't made bread pudding in a long, long time.  I came across this

&gt; Bread Pudding
&gt; Magpie's Café
&gt; Yield: 12 servings

&gt; 2 French baguettes (day-old or older, each 30 inches long and 8 to 10
&gt; ounces)

&gt; 1/2 gallon whole milk

&gt; 1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped

&gt; 1/4 cup golden raisins

&gt; 1/4 cup dried cranberries

&gt; 4 eggs

&gt; 1/2 cup packed brown sugar

&gt; 1/2 cup granulated sugar

&gt; 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

&gt; 1 tablespoon vanilla

&gt; 1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) cold butter

&gt; Caramel sauce or other dessert sauce, for serving

&gt; The day before serving, tear bread into 1-inch pieces and place in a
&gt; large mixing bowl. Pour in milk, pushing on bread so that it is covered
&gt; by milk. Cover bowl; refrigerate overnight.

&gt; The next day, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan (see
&gt; note).

&gt; Stir apple, raisins and cranberries into soaked bread. In a small bowl,
&gt; whisk together eggs, sugars, cinnamon and vanilla. Pour into the bread
&gt; mixture; stir well.

&gt; Pour into prepared pan. Cut the butter into small pieces and randomly
&gt; insert into the pudding.

&gt; Bake about 1 hour, until a knife inserted into the center comes out
&gt; sticky. (If it looks milky and wet, the pudding is not quite done. If
&gt; &quot;set&quot; pudding clings to the knife, it is done.) Cut into pieces; serve
&gt; with dessert sauce.

&gt; inside a larger pan or on a heavy cookie sheet.

Your recipe looks good enough to eat ;-)  I like that New Orleans
recipe, myself - the one that's a bread pudding souffle with whisky
sauce.  (Commander's Palace, I think.)  Yum.

Nuh-huh...maple syrup...REAL maple syrup, the light grade, not that
dark Aunt Jemima look-alike, although I daresay there's already plenty
of sugar in it what with dried fruit and all.

Thanks for the recipe, Michael. I love a good bread pudding. (For anyone in
the Baltimore area, the Crab Shanty, on Rt. 40, in Ellicott City, makes an
*excellent* version.)

My mom recently sent me a link for a pumpkin bread pudding recipe on the
King Arthur Flour site that looks good (and perfect for fall):

I used a whole panettone, and about a cup of sultanas/raisins soaked in
Muscat overnight and scattered over the panettone before puring the 1/2 and
1/2 over.
I left out the jam and the icing sugar as well.

Here's another recipe from a friend who said visited this place and raved
about the dessert:

Commander's Palace - New Orleans
BREAD PUDDING SOUFFLE WITH WHISKEY SAUCE
Yields 6

BREAD PUDDING

3/4 cups Sugar
1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
Pinch of Nutmeg
3 Medium Eggs
1 cup Heavy Cream
1 tsp. Vanilla
5 cups New Orleans French Bread, 1&quot; cubed (see note)
1/3 cup Raisins
(18: in length or approximately 1 1/3 G/ sliced thin)

WHISKEY SAUCE

1 cup Heavy Cream
1/2 Tbsp. Corn Starch
1 Tbsp. Water
3 Tbsp. Sugar
1/4 cup Bourbon

MERINGUE

9 Medium Egg Whites
3/4 cups Sugar
1/4 tsp. Cream of Tartar

To make the bread pudding, first preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 8&quot;
square baking pan. Combine sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Beat
in the eggs until smooth, then work in the heavy cream. Add the vanilla,
then the bread cubes. Allow bread to soak up custard.

Place the raisins in a greased pan. Top with the egg mixture, which prevents
the raisins from burning. Bake for approximately 25-30 minutes or until the
pudding has a golden brown color and is firm to the touch. If a toothpick
inserted in the pudding comes out clean, it is done. The mixture of pudding
should be nice and moist, not runny or dry. Cool to room temperature.

To make the whiskey sauce, place the cream in a small saucepan over medium
heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk corn starch and water together, and add to
cream while whisking. Bring to a boil. Whisk and let simmer for a few
seconds, taking care not to burn the mixture on the bottom. Remove from
heat.

Stir in the sugar and the bourbon. Taste to make sure the sauce has a thick
consistency, a sufficiently sweet taste, and a good bourbon flavor. Cool to
room temperature.

To make the meringue, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter six 6 ounce
ramekins. First, be certain that the bowl and whisk are clean. The egg
whites should be completely free of yolk, and they will whip better if the
chill is off them. This dish needs a good, stiff meringue. In a large bowl
or mixer, whip egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Add the sugar
gradually, and continue whipping until shiny and thick. Test with a clean
spoon. If the whites stand up stiff, like shaving cream, when you pull out
the spoon, the meringue is ready. Do not overwhip, or the whites will break
down and the soufflé will not work.

In a large bowl, break half the bread pudding into pieces using your hands
or a spoon. Gently fold in one-quarter of the meringue, being careful not to
lose the air in the whites. Add a portion of this base to each of the
ramekins.

Place the remaining bread pudding in the bowl, break into pieces, and
carefully fold in the rest of the meringue. Top off the soufflés with this
lighter mixture, to about 1 1/2 inches. Smooth and shape tops with spoon
into a dome over the ramekin rim. Bake immediately for approximately 20
minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately. Using a spoon, poke a hole
in the top of each soufflé, at the table, and pour the room temperature
whiskey sauce inside the soufflé.

Note: New Orleans French bread is very light and tender. If substitute bread
is used that is too dense, it will soak up all the custard and the recipe
will not work.
