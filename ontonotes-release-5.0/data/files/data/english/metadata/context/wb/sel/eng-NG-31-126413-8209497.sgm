Hi.  Just joined this group because I need some help.

I have a P5GDC-V Deluxe (sat in garage for about two years until last
week)
I just got my order from Newegg:

2 WD Caviar SATA2 320GB drives
2 sony DVD burners
2 GB RAM
Mitsumi floppy/integrated with media reader (SDC,  etc.)
Intel 560 3.4 Ghz P4
Ultra Xconnect 500watt power supply (waiting on the 20-24 pin power
cable from them)

here is the burning question, since SATA is a new thing to me:

I want both drives to be separate (C, D)
I want to put DVD burners (IDE) on separate IDE channels

How exactly do I do this?  What steps do I take first.  Can someone
explain how to do this up to and including loading the OS which will
be.........XP Pro!

Thanks to all the smarter than me people.

Hi,

Just connect the drives to thier respective connection's on the
motherboard.
Also you have to take a look in the BIOS, because there might be a
setting for the 2 SATA ports (RAID or JBOD).
One advice is: if you are not planning to use the SATA drives in a RAID
configuration, connect 1 drive first, and after OS install, the second
one.
HINT: Keep the SATA install drive at hand, WinXp install might ask for
it.

Good luck,
André

Windows XP installer normally does not have the SATA drivers in it.
Therefore you need to press F6 (during install) to use the SATA drivers
of ASUS. Just look at the bottom of the blue installer screen (first is
shows 'press F2 for autmatic repair' or something like that, after this
message it shows 'press F6 to install SATA/RAID drivers'

Just have a look at http://www.petri.co.il/install_windows_xp_pro.htm
Here is a kind of manual for installing Windows XP.
I was referring to step 3, point 2 (press F6 etc...)

Good luck, and let us know if it worked.

The P5GDC-V Deluxe has one IDE port on the Southbridge, and two IDE
ports on the 8212F. Personally, I would place both DVD burners on the
Southbridge interface, as that is likely to be the most seamless way
of using them. Less hassle if the DVD burners ever need a firmware
update and so on. Booting from them, should also be easier on the
Southbridge. (I'd feel more comfortable putting IDE hard drives
on the 8212F.)

The BIOS defaults (&quot;Standard IDE&quot;, &quot;Enhanced Mode&quot;) should support
installation without pressing F6. To do that, you'd want a WinXP
SP1 or SP2 install disk, as they have a PCI address space native
Microsoft driver in them. If your install disk is original WinXP,
you can use a tool like Autostreamer, to make a new install CD that
includes one of the two service packs.

For the SATA drives, just plug them in.

You don't need to use the adapter for the 20 pin power supply. The
20 pin should plug into the 24 pin connector. You can see the
commonality of pins between the two of them, in these docs. The
pictures here, are of the cable ends on the PSU. The pin 1 end is the
same on both connectors.

Thanks Paul....you seem to be one of the heavies here.  I read around
before joining. Thanks for the rescue.  Seems straightforward enough.
I am just incensed now that I spent $12.99 + shipping for the power
supply converter cable.  If you don't really need one......then why
the h***K do they make one and market it as if you really do need
one?  Just to make some$$$$?

thanks again!

That is a good question. The 20 pin to 24 pin adapter, moves the
&quot;burn point&quot; to where the adapter meets the power supply. At that
point, the current is still flowing through the one 12V pin on
the 20 pin connector. In that sense, the adapter doesn't solve
any problems. What it does do, is if a high current situation
were to arise, the PSU connector would be damaged, the
20 pin end of the adapter would be damaged, but the motherboard
would be saved.

The single pin on the 20 pin connector, is rated at 6 amps. That
12V wire, is connected to any adapter slot that needs it, as well
as the fan headers. In the current day, PCI Express x16 video cards,
would be the primary load. The highest number I've seen measured,
for the x16 slot, is 4.35A from 12V. The fan headers might have an
average load of, say, 0.5A. The other slots, might have a connection
to the 12V rail, but probably aren't using it. I would be most
concerned, if a lot of add-in cards started showing up, which
loaded down the 12V wire.

Based on the previous paragraph, for most users, no matter what
kind of single PCI Express video card they use, they should be
safe with a 20 pin power connector. If the motherboard is an
SLI or Crossfire config, and the user has two video cards, at
that point it is time to say, no more 20 pin supply. At that point,
it would be wise to invest in a 24 pin supply.

Some motherboards have a 1x4 Molex on the motherboard. For
SLI or Crossfile, that connector can help, and can delay the
need for the 24 pin connector. The Molex is good for up to about
8 amps (depends on the gauge of wire used), meaning a 20 pin
power connector, plus a 1x4 connected to the motherboard, gives
room for up to 14 amps to flow.

Getting back to the adapter again, another disadvantage of the
adapter, has to do with the remote sense function on the power
supply. You might notice (in those specs I quoted), that there
is provision for two wires to be connected to one of the 3.3V
pins on the PSU. The thinner of the two wires, is a sense wire.
Its job, is to take a sample of the voltage, right at what is
considered to be, the &quot;load&quot;. When you use an adapter, the voltage
drop in the adapter is no longer compensated by the remote
sense function. That is because the thin sense wire, is not
at the load any more, and is now &quot;half way along the cable&quot;,
The voltage error is small, but is another tiny issue with
the use of an adapter.

They make the adapters to fill a need :-) Customers want
the adapters - companies make them. Sort of like hood
ornaments for cars.

Well, I am almost at the point where I can power the pc up.  However,
there is just one more thing that I must do that I gotta admit is
beginning to confuse me greatly.  I have connectors on this
motherboard for the following fans (from manual):  4-pin CPU, 3-pin
PWR_FAN,
3-pin CHA_FAN 1, 3 -PIN CHA_FAN 2.  I thought that connecting them
would be a slam dunk.  apparently not.  I have connected just the CPU
fan --that was the easy one!  The pc case has room for a 120mm fan and
6 80mm fans.  The real  question is, which fan plugs into what above
connectors?  What is this PWR_FAN?  from what I have read, it is for a
connector coming from the power supply?  The power supply doesn't have
a connector like that (Ultra X-Connect 500W 20 pin - kinda old, but it
should work).  So, what fan plugs into  what mother board connector?
And for the remaining fans, just give them power from a Molex
connnector?  If so, how far can I split one Molex connector to power
the remaining fans?  They are just regular fans, not those RPM
controllable ones (Enermax UC8-EB for all 80mm ones and a Scythe S-
Flex SFF21F for the 120mm one (which is positioned in the back of the
case next to the i/o strip as a &quot;blow&quot; fan.  This fan hookup is
totally confusing.  Can someone please tell me in plain language how
to hook them up to my P5GDC-V Deluxe?

Now, for the final question. Once I am ready to throw the switch,
should I enter the bios immediately and configure, configure,
configure?  I have the original Cd  which says &quot;P5 series intel
925/915 chipset series support cd rev  78.14&quot; and I hope that it is
not outdated since this motherboard sat in my garage about two years
in the original box.  When would I put the cd in?  after the OS is
installed?  Would it  be this order:

1.  after build is complete, power on pc and enter bios
2.  configure  devices or make sure that they have been automatically
configured
3.  exit bios and flash to newest one (??)
4.  install OS
5.  Run as us Chipset support CD 78.14?

HELP!

&gt; connector coming from the power supply?  The power supply doesn't have
&gt; a connector like that (Ultra X-Connect 500W 20 pin - kinda old, but it
&gt; should work).  So, what fan plugs into  what mother board connector?
&gt; And for the remaining fans, just give them power from a Molex
&gt; connnector?  If so, how far can I split one Molex connector to power
&gt; the remaining fans?  They are just regular fans, not those RPM
&gt; controllable ones (Enermax UC8-EB for all 80mm ones and a Scythe S-
&gt; Flex SFF21F for the 120mm one (which is positioned in the back of the
&gt; case next to the i/o strip as a &quot;blow&quot; fan.  This fan hookup is
&gt; totally confusing.  Can someone please tell me in plain language how
&gt; to hook them up to my P5GDC-V Deluxe?

&gt; Now, for the final question. Once I am ready to throw the switch,
&gt; should I enter the bios immediately and configure, configure,
&gt; configure?  I have the original Cd  which says &quot;P5 series intel
&gt; 925/915 chipset series support cd rev  78.14&quot; and I hope that it is
&gt; not outdated since this motherboard sat in my garage about two years
&gt; in the original box.  When would I put the cd in?  after the OS is
&gt; installed?  Would it  be this order:

&gt; 1.  after build is complete, power on pc and enter bios
&gt; 2.  configure  devices or make sure that they have been automatically
&gt; configured
&gt; 3.  exit bios and flash to newest one (??)
&gt; 4.  install OS
&gt; 5.  Run as us Chipset support CD 78.14?

&gt; HELP!

Each of the fan headers, appears to have a full set of three pins.
Which means, if all you want is to run cooling fans, you have three
3 pin headers to use with three fans. A PWR_FAN header is typically
used for a PWR_FAN connector from a power supply, for RPM monitoring.
If you don't have one of those, the header can still be used to
power an ordinary fan.

As far as how many fans, the basic idea is to establish a front to back
airflow. The exhaust fan on the back helps do that for you. When you
have a large number of fans, it becomes difficult to figure out where
the air is going, and what is really getting cooled. When a case has
many, many fans on it, it can be hard to figure out what to do with
them all. (On one of my cases, I used more than the minimum number of
fans, and air was actually blowing backwards through the weakest fan.
Balancing multiple fans is loads of fun.)

If a fan is not doing anything, its presence is still an issue. The
hole the fan leaves, still affects the airflow. For example, if just
the exhaust fan on the back is hooked up, all the other fan holes
become intake vents. And that may not put the airflow where you want
it.

On one of my cases, with a side fan, I removed the fan and covered the
hole with sheet aluminum (auto body repair, lightweight). The air
leak it causes, would reduce the cooling my hard drive is getting.
So you have to plan a bit, whether to use the fan, or remove the
fan and cover the hole.

For a well cooled case, if room temp is 25C, the case internal temp
should be no more than about 32C to 35C. If it rises much higher,
that makes it harder for the CPU cooler to do its job. And with
stock Intel fans that sense the air temp, the Intel fan will speed
up and become noisy, if the internal case air is too hot.

Many BIOS items have nice default values. You may have to adjust something
on the RAM, to get error free operation. If the computer is stable in
the BIOS, your next step is running a standalone memory tester like
memtest86+ (memtest.org). In two complete passes, zero errors would be
the desired objective. If the computer is not error free at this point,
there is no point installing an OS, as the OS files could be corrupted
as they are stored on the hard drive. Memtest86+ can boot from a floppy,
or you can burn a CD with the program - the program is self-booting.

You may want to disable any peripheral chips you aren't using. Disabling
storage controllers, can help reduce the boot time (important when doing
a lot of reboots when first setting up the computer). Other than that,
I recommend reading the manual and its BIOS section, item by item, and
deciding for yourself, what needs to be adjusted.

The driver CD is for after the OS install. For the OS to install, if the
storage devices are connected to the Southbridge, there might not be
any driver needed, to get them recognized. WinXP SP1 would be the minimum
version I would recommend for that. SP1 will help with SATA drives, and
with drives over 137GB. (You can slipstream a release CD, to incorporate
SP1 and prepare a new installer CD. I think I used AutoStreamer for the
job a couple years ago.)

The OS runs graphics in a default VESA mode, a Microsoft driver is used
for the hard disk, and the other peripherals at that point, might not have
any driver loaded. When you install the driver CD at that point, you
get the opportunity to install things like NIC drivers, which might not
be on the OS CD. Also, the chipset drivers (Northbridge and Southbridge),
help with getting Device Manager to recognize stuff properly. It is not
possible to install the driver CD, before the OS is there, so the order
of install is fixed in that sense.

As for flashing the BIOS, you check the CPUSupport web page, the
type of your processor, and the required BIOS release. That tells
you the minimum BIOS version required. The label placed on the top of
the BIOS chip, should say what version was flashed at the factory.
Check the Asus download page, for the change log, as to what was
fixed in each BIOS.

http://support.asus.com.tw/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx?SLanguage=en-us
http://support.asus.com.tw/cpusupport/cpu_support_right_master.aspx?t...

These are the release notes for 1011. Since it updates the BIOS internal
driver for the ITE8212, that might be a good reason to do a flash upgrade.
The &quot;option ROM&quot; provides INT 0x13 support, giving the ability to do
basic read/write at the BIOS level. That is how the OS starts to boot,
even though the OS drivers aren't loaded yet. So if your plan is to use
the IT8212 for booting, I'd flash upgrade before doing anything else. If
you can survive with just the Southbridge, the need to flash upgrade
might not be as urgent.

[ 1011 ]
----------------------
1- Support new CPUs. Please refer to our website at: http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx
2- Update ITE8212 option ROM
3- Modify CPU fan low limlt speed to 800 RPM
4- Fix that the Boot time is too long If there is no CD in CD-ROM while connected to ITE controller

In terms of interfaces, you have one IDE and four SATA on the Southbridge.
Those are the interfaces I'd use first. If I had a single IDE CDROM and an
IDE hard drive, I'd put them on the same cable and connect them to the
Southbridge port. Then, I wouldn't need to press F6 during the install
and install a driver for them. Once the Southbridge is full, you can
move to the IT8212, but would need a driver installed by F6, if you plan
on actually booting a hard drive while it is connected to the IT8212. If
the drives connected to the IT8212 are only for

The seven wires you show for your computer case, are &quot;AC'97&quot; compatible.
I have yet to see a computer case with HDaudio/Azalia wiring, so they're
all the same as far as I know.

You want to use the Legacy AC'97 definition of your motherboard header.
You set the BIOS to indicate that you are using the Legacy mode.

The CODEC chip is still HDaudio, so that part doesn't change. The chip
still functions in HDaudio fashion. The BIOS declaration just affects
the computer doing the right thing with the header wiring.

The header only has five functional pins. Four of the header pins are
&quot;NC&quot; or &quot;No Connect&quot;.

Your cable has seven wires. Two wires will not be used. The &quot;L-Ret&quot; and
&quot;R-Ret&quot; will not be used. The remaining five wires connect as follows:

AGND            ===&gt; Black = Ground
MIC2            ===&gt; Red 2 = Mic in
MICPWR          ===&gt; yellow 2 = mic-power
Line_Out_R      ===&gt; yellow 1 = R-out
Line_Out_L      ===&gt; white 1 = L-out

Another question has popped up.   Although I have all the wires from
the case plugged in to the right motherborad pins (power, reset,
audio, etc.) I now wonder, and please excuse my stupidity, since the
pin plug can be installed either way on the motherboard pins, for
example - take the &quot;power&quot;  plug that is coming from the case wire.
It has two holes in it to be inserted on the two pins from the
motherboard and it is not KEYED, it can be inserted either way--180
degrees.  How do know which way is correct.  The wires are different
colors---does it matter ?  I don't want to  power it up if I don't
know this for sure.

Thanks again.

For the power, reset and audio connectors it doesn't matter.
Only the power led and hard drive led matter. Usually one
side of the pin is marked as +. If you by chance get them on
the wrong way there will be no harm done. If the led's are
not lighting up, all you have to do is reconnect them the
other way around the next time the computer is shut off. You
don't want to be fooling around inside the case with a live
mother board in case you accidentally short something.

Success!!  I double checked all connections and finally powered up.
It went right into the BIOS.  It's alive!  Temperatures seem to hover
at around 118-125 degrees F.  The only problem I had was a noisy fan,
which was screwed to the case but when I relocated it, the noise was
gone.  It recognized all the 2GB of memory (2048MB) and the drives.
Now that I am in the BIOS, I will need to go very slowly to configure
it.  I am now very confused at all the BIOS settings and particularly
the SATA drives.  I really don't know how to configure them.   I want
to get the most efficiency out of them and am wondering exactly how I
should configure them.  Just two 320GB SATA drives. NO RAID.;;  Just a
C and D drive.  Per Paul's suggestion, the two DVD burners are on the
primary ide channel as master and slave.  Can someone please tell me
how exactly to configure these SATA drives for the most efficiency
since I now need to install the operating system (WIN XP SP1).

Thanks all!
