Hello,

A copy of the rules a proposed contest I will be proposing for the society
is on the Google page (reflector) of common files for the society.

I will be doing a presentation on proposing a contest during the
conference.  A few years back the idea of a contest was thrown out by some
and I came up with one that was too complicated.

Over time I realized that having fun in a contest is more important than
addressing all the quirks of said contest.  That being said this contest
idea is not meant to be an improvement but a different way to compete.

This proposal is a combination of informal input from some old timers and
some of the original ideas I had.  I think one the issues we have with vhf
contests out here is the long periods of inactivity as we wait for someone
to turn on their radio and this might address this issue.

There is a few weeks before a call for final papers and I invite anyone to
send ideas, comments, criticisms, ect… to me directly or I don’t mind an
open discussion. I called for some logs of which I received about 8 of and I
did see the need for a change here and there and some more simplification.

One question I had:

A rover sub-band was suggested to eliminate QRM for the rovers, however is
this an advantage shared by all (IE the rover and the stationary station?)
or should it go away?

Another is the timing of the contest weekeend, I'm open to suggestions.
Should this be an e-skip contest or a tropo based contest?

Again I don’t mean to pick on the ARRL contests or the sprints or the CQ
contest, they are all similar with different rules here and there.  This one
is a little bit further from the center, but I’m not sure it’s a bad thing.

Thanks to those who gave some input and logs. Anyone who want's to be more
involved IE a contest committee please let me know and I will provide more
info about the proposed administration of this contest. Its not too
difficult, 1 man is running the spring sprints and a HRO store at the same
time.

Frank &amp; everybody,

Regarding the weekend of choice question:

I'm not a contester, I don't care one bit about scores. I get on for
VHF/UHF contests simply because that's about the only time you can make
VHF/UHF contacts without a schedule anymore.

I have little interest in 6 meters and usually confine my operations to
144 and above unless requested to move to 6 to give somebody a point.
It has been my observation that if 6 opens up, you might just as well
turn off all the other bands for the rest of the contest.

It seems to me that if the object of this effort is to promote activity
on ALL the bands, either 6 meters should be eliminated from the contest
altogether or the contest placed on a weekend where there is absolutely
no chance of any kind of 6 meter opening. Of course, given my lack of
interest in scores, maybe I'm missing the point of this whole proposal.

Wow Larry,

I totally agree! Yesterday 6 was open, so was 144. No one on 144, everyone
still playing on 6. Granted 6 was open, but there was little in the way of
anything new. No EU, no S. America, JA's whatever. Yet 144 offered TX,
Colorado, NV, CA and Utah from here and I would suspect your location too. I
see Bruce reached out a bit and worked Mac on 222. So either folks just
prefer to get on 6 and make a ton of repeat grids, maybe a few new ones
(though the savvy 50 meg folks have worked nearly everywhere US already
anyway) or there doesn't seem to much effort for whatever reason anywhere
else?

Contesting has become a hassle in some realms, as you and I know the
constant discussions of each years events on the Moon. Granted Lionel always
did a great job with producing a Mean of all the input and it worked for
most, it still required many folks much time planning the time to
participate as these event we know to well are grueling. For me personally,
which country I was going to operate from and planning my travels.

Tropo contesting is not related to any &quot;target&quot; being there and is already
(with most sponsored events arrl, cq, etc.) planned in times of likely
better than poorer times of year for such propagation.

My suggestion to you Frank (and I appreciate anyone's efforts in trying to
lead any crowd) is pick some time segments that remain constant every year.
Maybe start paying more points immediately above 50 megs so folks don't get
stuck there!

It is difficult to imagine what Frank has in mind, but I would appreciate a
heads up anytime rather than first notice at the conference.

Might as well start haggling now, as that is what is to come.

Anybody going anywhere?

I'm thinking Rover with 222, 432, 903, 1296. Is it worth digging out 2.3 and
10G?

How about some 10G down the coast? According to Hepburn the tropo will fall
apart by the weekend, but I could get out to CN79bc by Tofino on Sunday
morning if there is a dance partner down the coast.

I'll probably start out in CN88bv at my usual perch for the first few hours
and go from there.

Jeremy and others interested,

The 2 mtr Es over the weekend did not present itself at this QTH. I was
there and listening hard both east and south. Nothing but PNW guys
CQ'ing, never did hear any of them make a contact. A week or so ago, I
missed out. There probably was some 2 mtr Es here as W7MEM made at
least one contact, but by the time I got on, it was all over.

The week before that, I was monitoring 6 (weekday) and the Es got short
and intense. I figured there was 2 mtr Es but nobody at the other end
of the path.

So there you go, does a  tree falling in the woods make noise if
there's nobody there, is the band open if nobody's on??

Well, I don't know about that, Jeremy. There were
several of us on 2m watching closely for any
sporadic-E propagation on 2-meters. Outside of a
single CW signal that was too weak to copy, there was
no action for me. And, I don't think anyone in the
Seattle are got anything. But, it wasn't because
nobody was on. By the way, there weren't a heck of a
lot of guys on 6-meters around here, either,
considering the VHF population density of the area.

I know that VE7SL was able to connect on 2-meters with
K7CA in DM37, but we got left out.

I don't know where you got your information that all
those states were into here via sporadic-E. Would you
mind telling us?

I don't know what the big problem with 6-meters is.
It's the most popular VHF band. I'd emphasize it, not
ignore or reject it in a contest.

73,
Paul, K7CW

jeremy etall...

Jim (YO) posted the latest verioin of the rules. I'd hope that they are easy
enough to understand and would want them to be so for some guy who looked
them up on the web or in a magazine.  So let me know what you dont
understand and I will see if I can write it better.  I might be so in depth
in this that I dont see it as a newcomer.

I have a slide show on power point thats close to done, and explains it but
it needs to be more practical.  Then again in my first contest I didnt think
about the mechanics of the contest itself. Actually I didnt think about it
in depth until my 5th rove in 2004.

Thinks are more fun when you dont think about what your doing...... well
until you get hurt.

I would suggest a constant weekend.

If n7db is reading this, what is the adverage chance of an e-skip opening on
any given day in July?

I think it would still be like an arrl contest, it becomes a different event
when 6 meters opens.

73s

Larry has a real good point, the purpose of a contest is to compete; if 6m opens, all the other bands suffer from a lack of activity. I hope any local contest we define promotes and encourages operating the use of the bands above 2m.

There are all sorts of options-
no 6m
2 contests, a 6m only and all other bands.
2 day limited hours - day 1 6m, day 2 all others with awards each day and both.
Maybe some kind of multiplier to better encourage multi band/modes.
other options I didn't think of.

If we do a contest I would like us to encourage spotting - internet or otherwise so we can learn how to make those 300 mile plus contacts that normally are hit and miss (mostly miss).

Larry has a real good point, the purpose of a contest is to compete; if 6m opens, all the other bands suffer from a lack of activity. I hope any local contest we define promotes and encourages operating the use of the bands above 2m.

There are all sorts of options-
no 6m
2 contests, a 6m only and all other bands.
2 day limited hours - day 1 6m, day 2 all others with awards each day and both.
Maybe some kind of multiplier to better encourage multi band/modes.
other options I didn't think of.

If we do a contest I would like us to encourage spotting - internet or otherwise so we can learn how to make those 300 mile plus contacts that normally are hit and miss (mostly miss).

Regarding the weekend of choice question:

I'm not a contester, I don't care one bit about scores. I get on for VHF/UHF contests simply because that's about the only time you can make VHF/UHF contacts without a schedule anymore.

I have little interest in 6 meters and usually confine my operations to 144 and above unless requested to move to 6 to give somebody a point. It has been my observation that if 6 opens up, you might just as well turn off all the other bands for the rest of the contest.

It seems to me that if the object of this effort is to promote activity on ALL the bands, either 6 meters should be eliminated from the contest altogether or the contest placed on a weekend where there is absolutely no chance of any kind of 6 meter opening. Of course, given my lack of interest in scores, maybe I'm missing the point of this whole proposal.

Hello,

A copy of the rules a proposed contest I will be proposing for the society
is on the Google page (reflector) of common files for the society.

I will be doing a presentation on proposing a contest during the
conference.  A few years back the idea of a contest was thrown out by some
and I came up with one that was too complicated.

Over time I realized that having fun in a contest is more important than
addressing all the quirks of said contest.  That being said this contest
idea is not meant to be an improvement but a different way to compete.

This proposal is a combination of informal input from some old timers and
some of the original ideas I had.  I think one the issues we have with vhf
contests out here is the long periods of inactivity as we wait for someone
to turn on their radio and this might address this issue.

There is a few weeks before a call for final papers and I invite anyone to
send ideas, comments, criticisms, ect... to me directly or I don't mind an
open discussion. I called for some logs of which I received about 8 of and I
did see the need for a change here and there and some more simplification.

One question I had:

A rover sub-band was suggested to eliminate QRM for the rovers, however is
this an advantage shared by all (IE the rover and the stationary station?)
or should it go away?

Another is the timing of the contest weekeend, I'm open to suggestions.
Should this be an e-skip contest or a tropo based contest?

Again I don't mean to pick on the ARRL contests or the sprints or the CQ
contest, they are all similar with different rules here and there.  This one
is a little bit further from the center, but I'm not sure it's a bad thing.

Thanks to those who gave some input and logs. Anyone who want's to be more
involved IE a contest committee please let me know and I will provide more
info about the proposed administration of this contest. Its not too
difficult, 1 man is running the spring sprints and a HRO store at the same
time.

Frank

how about only grid counting multipliers on 2 meters up
therefore 6 meters would be 1-7 points and 2 meters up 1-7 points plus
modifiers for what should be semi local grids. This should put the focus
more towards 2 meters. I could make a multiplier for each band like the ARRL
does but that gets more complicated though we are familiar with that concept
and theres a urge here to keep it simple and have fun.

Theres something to be said for letting a little guy compete vs building a
big station.

Would this be a suitable comprimise? That being like the arrl but drop the
grid multiplers on 6 meters I have mixed feelings about that because a guy
in a hole gets out on 6 meters the best. And is band conditions a crap shoot
thats fair to all?  IE if the west has e-skip and the weast does not or visa
versa.

Again this isnt meant to fix anything but to just have fun. Ie if 6 meters
opens then everyone would be trying all three modes there to maximise
points.  The cw band would be crowded because of the need to get more points
and I bet psk would become popular for qiuick qsos while wsjt would be used
for dead bands.

Right now Im leaning towards the above comprimise, excuse me for typing my
thinking here.

I skimmed the proposed contest rules and have the following suggestions:

1.  Look at the Stew Perry Topband Distance Challenge rules
( http://jzap.com/k7rat/stew.rules.txt ).  These rules could be modified
to
use the 6-letter grid designator and award 1 point for each 100 km (or
portion thereof) of distance between stations  (350 km is 4 points).
You
could award 2 or more points per 100 km for the higher bands to
encourage activity there.  Reward long distance contacts by not
limiting
the number of points based on some arbitary maximum distance.

2.  If you want to encourage activity on as many bands as possible, then
award
grid multipliers for each band worked, not just once regardless of the
number
of bands worked.  I would also consider not using grid multipliers at
all and
making this a purely distance-based contest.

3.  Determine if EME contacts should be allowed or if only terrestrial QSO's
are allowed.

4.  Consider separate categories for single band, two/three band, and all
band
operation.

5.  Use Cabrillo format logs, not paper logs.  Accept paper logs if you
like, but
I'd plan on a computer-based log checking approach.  I understand why
some
use paper logs (especially when roving), but I won't use them or create
them
for a contest, especially if dupe sheets also have to be generated.
Tree, N6TR
has software for checking Stew Perry logs.  Maybe he'd be willing to
modify
the code or let one of us modify it to support this contest.

6.  Don't tailgate Field Day with this contest.  That would make 3 contests
in
4 weekends (June VHF, Field Day, and this one).

7.  I like contests that start at 1800Z on Saturday and end at 2100Z on
Sunday.
They leave a little weekend time left over for other activities and
chores.  I would
also limit total operating time to about 18-20 hours of the 27 hour
contest period.

Just my $0.02 worth.

Aloha to all:

Sorry for the late response, we took the dory out again....

Perhaps you may wish to review reflector emails. On 29th July at around
22:11, again 22:14 and again 22:32 zulu .... My posts to the reflector, you
will see what was going on while you must have been either doing something
else or dumping my mail into an unknown depository. There was a lot of
activity on 144. Last E's I saw on 144 was a VE5 calling Lance, and as
fortune would put it, only fades of w7gj saying, &quot;Looking North&quot;.

I believe also at this time, for whatever reason I was doing some email with
Bruce, sending a heads up, as Redding was open. So was the popper at Tooele,
UT (the phase modulated noise bumps at 144.170 and 144.330).

Anyway, I am for all intents, on the 45th parallel, nothing uncommon about
this geography support higher MUF going east than those of you even 200
miles north. Don't need to watch Gab's site (as apparently many of you are
depending on) to know when 144 is &quot;providing&quot; treats. 144 has been my band
of choice for over 15 years. I know what to expect when I hear certain
indicators. I have a fair idea of how to utilize them and certainly have the
equipment to collect from it. You may wish to explore some of the phenomena
available other than the internet for VHF (50 megs is more trendy towards HF
characteristics if you ask me, someone mis-labeled it decades ago). None of
the latter to be interpreted as anything but suggestion, as I am certain
mainy of the list subscribers are savvy to propagation, just please be
careful with accusations such as &quot;I don't know about that&quot; (Paul). I believe
in 5 minutes at my place, you would see I know &quot;about that&quot;.

Paul, I am not going to argue with you, as you have thrown at me more than
once, you feel you have vast experience, I suppose you do on 50 megs, you
must be at least 30 years older than I! However, sad as it is, you missed
the boat on the 29th, or maybe you didn't, if 50 megs is what you like.

People on this list or in this ohana complain if you don't post openings and
they miss out, now I see they complain if you do post, hmm....

Anyway, I guess I should not have complained about no locals on 144, was
simply agreeing with Larry. The popularity of 50 megs these days is mainly
due to those experiencing for the first time, judging on the 29th,
apparently thousands of them. I think you old timers would agree, the 29th
was more of a crowd than it was a convention, like I said it was for the
most part, the lower 48 and a few Canadians...a good day to WAS or VUCC, no
DXCC. A 6m opening non the less

So with that, glad you all had fun! I did too, was nice to chat with some
old friends from the mobile and a whip!

Now I am reading Jim's page as per Frank's suggestion and will ponder this
and perhaps comment in a future posting.

Jeremy

Well, I don't know about that, Jeremy. There were
several of us on 2m watching closely for any
sporadic-E propagation on 2-meters. Outside of a
single CW signal that was too weak to copy, there was
no action for me. And, I don't think anyone in the
Seattle are got anything. But, it wasn't because
nobody was on. By the way, there weren't a heck of a
lot of guys on 6-meters around here, either,
considering the VHF population density of the area.

I know that VE7SL was able to connect on 2-meters with
K7CA in DM37, but we got left out.

I don't know where you got your information that all
those states were into here via sporadic-E. Would you
mind telling us?

I don't know what the big problem with 6-meters is.
It's the most popular VHF band. I'd emphasize it, not
ignore or reject it in a contest.

<POSTDATE> 2007-07-31T12:48:00 </POSTDATE>
Some points to ponder:

1) Before any rules/scoring can be decided on, we must know what the
real purpose of this effort is. Is it to provide another weekend to
have &quot;fun&quot;? Is it to promote some aspect of the PNWVHFS? Is it to
encourage activity on some particular band or bands? It's not clear to
me where this is supposed to wind up, but maybe it is to others.

2) No matter how complex and convoluted the rules and scoring are, if 6
meters opens up, it becomes a 6 meter contest. The sheer number of
people with 6 meter capability guarantees this. Just look at any of the
established contests. If the purpose of this effort is to just have
fun, I don't have a problem with 6 meters. If the purpose is to
increase activity on the real VHF/UHF bands, then serious consideration
must be given to eliminating 6 meters from the equation. It all comes
back to point #1 above.

3) Scoring by distance, as in the Stew Perry 160 test, is a great way
to promote weak signal activity and reward those who work at it. But,
the points should be proportional to the frequency. For instance, 100
kM on 6 might be 1 point, 144 = 3 points, 222 = 4, 432 = 6, 1296 = 18,
24 Gig = 480 points, etc.

4) If the point of the effort is to promote activity, serious
consideration should be given to making the rules ENCOURAGE real time
sked co-ordination using the Internet or telephone or even 2 meter FM
repeaters. ( I don't believe I just said that!) Now I know the
&quot;purists&quot; are going to scream about cheating etc., but this isn't the
Olympics, or the NFL, or NASCAR. The best way I know of to increase
activity is to make it easier to actually make a contact. First timers
often need help to get going. If they are working in a vacuum, they
almost always give up and find something else to do. Of course, if the
point of the effort is to create another contest for contesters, then
this sort of co-ordination should be discouraged.

5) I believe start times should be very much earlier than usual. The
best tropo conditions occur around sunrise. It's kinda foolish to make
early risers wait around until the sleepy heads get up and miss out on
the best conditions. 1800z start times invariably result in a flurry of
activity at the start and long range contacts are unlikely due to QRM
on the popular calling frequencies. Starting at 1200z on Saturday
morning would allow early risers to chance to play under the best tropo
conditions and also spread out the rush at the gate we normally see. We
do have people in the Mountain time zone to consider as well.

It turns out that I have very little stake in the whole business. I'll
get the bands I like if there's activity of any kind, and if not, I'll
just go read a book.

and theres a urge here to keep it simple and have fun.

Theres something to be said for letting a little guy compete vs building a
big station.

Would this be a suitable comprimise? That being like the arrl but drop the
grid multiplers on 6 meters I have mixed feelings about that because a guy
in a hole gets out on 6 meters the best. And is band conditions a crap shoot
thats fair to all? IE if the west has e-skip and the weast does not or visa
versa.

Again this isnt meant to fix anything but to just have fun. Ie if 6 meters
opens then everyone would be trying all three modes there to maximise
points. The cw band would be crowded because of the need to get more points
and I bet psk would become popular for qiuick qsos while wsjt would be used
for dead bands.

Right now Im leaning towards the above comprimise, excuse me for typing my
thinking here. From: Greg Chartrand &lt;w7my@yahoo.com&gt; To: k3uhf@hotmail.com CC: PNWVHFS@googlegroups.com Subject: Re: [PNWVHFS] Re: Contest suggestions/ update

Larry has a real good point, the purpose of a contest is to compete; if 6m
opens, all the other bands suffer from a lack of activity. I hope any local
contest we define promotes and encourages operating the use of the bands
above 2m.

There are all sorts of options-
no 6m
2 contests, a 6m only and all other bands.
2 day limited hours - day 1 6m, day 2 all others with awards each day and
both.
Maybe some kind of multiplier to better encourage multi band/modes.
other options I didn't think of.

If we do a contest I would like us to encourage spotting - internet or
otherwise so we can learn how to make those 300 mile plus contacts that
normally are hit and miss (mostly miss).

Regarding the weekend of choice question:

I'm not a contester, I don't care one bit about scores. I get on for
VHF/UHF contests simply because that's about the only time you can make
VHF/UHF contacts without a schedule anymore.

I have little interest in 6 meters and usually confine my operations to
144 and above unless requested to move to 6 to give somebody a point. It
has been my observation that if 6 opens up, you might just as well turn off
all the other bands for the rest of the contest.

It seems to me that if the object of this effort is to promote activity
on ALL the bands, either 6 meters should be eliminated from the contest
altogether or the contest placed on a weekend where there is absolutely no
chance of any kind of 6 meter opening. Of course, given my lack of interest
in scores, maybe I'm missing the point of this whole proposal.

Hello,

A copy of the rules a proposed contest I will be proposing for the
society
is on the Google page (reflector) of common files for the society.

I will be doing a presentation on proposing a contest during the
conference. A few years back the idea of a contest was thrown out by some
and I came up with one that was too complicated.

Over time I realized that having fun in a contest is more important than
addressing all the quirks of said contest. That being said this contest
idea is not meant to be an improvement but a different way to compete.

This proposal is a combination of informal input from some old timers and
some of the original ideas I had. I think one the issues we have with vhf
contests out here is the long periods of inactivity as we wait for someone
to turn on their radio and this might address this issue.

There is a few weeks before a call for final papers and I invite anyone
to
send ideas, comments, criticisms, ect... to me directly or I don't mind an
open discussion. I called for some logs of which I received about 8 of and
I
did see the need for a change here and there and some more simplification.

One question I had:

A rover sub-band was suggested to eliminate QRM for the rovers, however is
this an advantage shared by all (IE the rover and the stationary station?)
or should it go away?

Another is the timing of the contest weekeend, I'm open to suggestions.
Should this be an e-skip contest or a tropo based contest?

Again I don't mean to pick on the ARRL contests or the sprints or the CQ
contest, they are all similar with different rules here and there. This
one
is a little bit further from the center, but I'm not sure it's a bad thing.

Thanks to those who gave some input and logs. Anyone who want's to be more
involved IE a contest committee please let me know and I will provide more
info about the proposed administration of this contest. Its not too
difficult, 1 man is running the spring sprints and a HRO store at the same
time.

Larry, Good Points.
I'd like to respond to each below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
--- Larry &lt;la ... @w7iuv.com&gt; wrote:

---------------------------------
Some points to ponder:

1) Before any rules/scoring can be decided on, we must
know what the real purpose of this effort is. Is it to
provide another weekend to have &quot;fun&quot;? Is it to
promote some aspect of the PNWVHFS? Is it to encourage
activity on some particular band or bands? It's not
clear tome where this is supposed to wind up, but
maybe it is to others.

It isn't clear to me, either. So far, it looks like
just another contest, but with complex rules.

2) No matter how complex and convoluted the rules and
scoring are, if 6meters opens up, it becomes a 6 meter
contest. The sheer number ofpeople with 6 meter
capability guarantees this. Just look at any of
theestablished contests. If the purpose of this effort
is to just havefun, I don't have a problem with 6
meters.

Well said!

If the purpose is toincrease activity on the real
VHF/UHF bands, then serious considerationmust be given
to eliminating 6 meters from the equation. It all
comesback to point #1 above.

But, the problem is that the bands above 6-meters are
BORING most of the time. You'd better introduce an
interesting aspect to contesting on 2-meters and
higher, or else keep 6-meters. Otherwise, you probably
won't have many competitors interested in entering the
contest.

3) Scoring by distance, as in the Stew Perry 160 test,
is a great wayto promote weak signal activity and
reward those who work at it. But,the points should be
proportional to the frequency. For instance, 100kM on
6 might be 1 point, 144 = 3 points, 222 = 4, 432 = 6,
1296 = 18,24 Gig = 480 points, etc.

I agree. You might have some folks shun the contest
because they don't want to deal with calculating their
scores, though.

4) If the point of the effort is to promote activity,
serious consideration should be given to making the
rules ENCOURAGE real timesked co-ordination using the
Internet or telephone or even 2 meter FMrepeaters. ( I
don't believe I just said that!) Now I know
the&quot;purists&quot; are going to scream about cheating etc.,

I wouldn't be worried about cheating. To me, the
problem would be that some stations would not or could
not use the telephone or Internet to set up skeds,
whatever their reasons.

but this isn't theOlympics, or the NFL, or NASCAR. The
best way I know of to increaseactivity is to make it
easier to actually make a contact. First timersoften
need help to get going. If they are working in a
vacuum, theyalmost always give up and find something
else to do.

Actually, I like the idea of being able to call
someone on the telephone to set up a sked. For
instance, if a band opening is discovered, I would
want to be able to alert a distant station to get on.
But, I think that you might want to have two
categories. One category allows free use of the media
to set up skeds. The other would forbid it.

Of course, if thepoint of the effort is to create
another contest for contesters, thenthis sort of
co-ordination should be discouraged.

Why?

5) I believe start times should be very much earlier
than usual. Thebest tropo conditions occur around
sunrise. It's kinda foolish to makeearly risers wait
around until the sleepy heads get up and miss out
onthe best conditions. 1800z start times invariably
result in a flurry ofactivity at the start and long
range contacts are unlikely due to QRMon the popular
calling frequencies. Starting at 1200z on
Saturdaymorning would allow early risers to chance to
play under the best tropoconditions and also spread
out the rush at the gate we normally see. Wedo have
people in the Mountain time zone to consider as well.

What about people in the Eastern Time Zone? Do you
have everyone start at the same time locally? I've
always been under the impression that contest start
times favor the Eastern Seaboard. But, it really
doesn't matter what they are doing Back East. I like
your idea of starting early.

It turns out that I have very little stake in the
whole business. I'll get the bands I like if there's
activity of any kind, and if not, I'll just go read a
book.

73, Larry

I like interesting contests. If contests were more
interesting to operate on the higher bands, I would be
more inclined to gear up for those bands. I don't
think there really is a need for another
run-of-the-mill contest. Maybe a way can be found to
offer a difference. In any event, don't schedule this
contest to be within a month of any other major VHF
contest.

All,

Just my 2 cents worth. My main interest in ham radio is the VHF and up
bands. I have equipment of one sort or another for 6 meters through 3 cm.,
but there's obviously very little activity on the upper bands, especially
for us dry-siders. I'm for virtually any contest (or other publicized
operating activity) that brings people out to operate the higher bands. To
encourage upper band usage in a contest, I support ideas that give lots of
extra points (however calculated) for upper band contacts.

Paul &amp; others,

Paul, no offense but I think you're a hopeless case. The whole debate
so far seems to be centered on what is interesting and what is not to
the individuals concerned.

I'm a weak signal DX'er, doesn't matter what band or mode, for me the
hunt is the point. I cannot think of anything more boring to me on the
radio than running 6 QSO's a minute with signals 40 dB out of the
noise. It's just plain hard work, not to mention the time and expense
of the QSL's that will surely show up in the mail.

Look at the microwave guys. They spend days if not weeks preparing for
a hilltop expedition and hours setting up. If they make one new
contact, the whole effort is worthwhile for them.

I might spend days or even weeks chasing something rare on the low
bands or the EME bands. On the average I spend 4-5 hours listening for
every MINUTE I spend transmitting. On the other hand, it takes two to
tango and if I know with a great deal of certainty that there is nobody
on at the other end of the path I will loose interest and go read a
book instead.

Again, it all boils down to what the purpose of this effort is. If you
want to get people on the higher bands, it's going to be necessary to
make it the only game in town. If there is a different purpose, by all
means do something different. The only thing that really matters to me
is to get a consensus on the purpose, other wise we are in for endless
debate.

And the elimination of endless debate is the reason I suggested
eliminating &quot;assisted&quot; contacts from a &quot;real&quot; contest. No one can agree
on what &quot;assisted&quot; means in any other contest on the planet and the
debates usually wind up in fist fights. Why screw around, just make the
problem go away to begin with.

Rule complexity doesn't really mean anything for me as I usually don't
follow the rules anyway which is why I never send in a log......

Some points to ponder:

1) Before any rules/scoring can be decided on, we must
know what the real purpose of this effort is. Is it to
provide another weekend to have &quot;fun&quot;? Is it to
promote some aspect of the PNWVHFS? Is it to encourage
activity on some particular band or bands? It's not
clear tome where this is supposed to wind up, but
maybe it is to others.

It isn't clear to me, either. So far, it looks like
just another contest, but with complex rules.

2) No matter how complex and convoluted the rules and
scoring are, if 6meters opens up, it becomes a 6 meter
contest. The sheer number ofpeople with 6 meter
capability guarantees this. Just look at any of
theestablished contests. If the purpose of this effort
is to just havefun, I don't have a problem with 6
meters.

Well said!

If the purpose is toincrease activity on the real
VHF/UHF bands, then serious considerationmust be given
to eliminating 6 meters from the equation. It all
comesback to point #1 above.

But, the problem is that the bands above 6-meters are
BORING most of the time. You'd better introduce an
interesting aspect to contesting on 2-meters and
higher, or else keep 6-meters. Otherwise, you probably
won't have many competitors interested in entering the
contest.

3) Scoring by distance, as in the Stew Perry 160 test,
is a great wayto promote weak signal activity and
reward those who work at it. But,the points should be
proportional to the frequency. For instance, 100kM on
6 might be 1 point, 144 = 3 points, 222 = 4, 432 = 6,
1296 = 18,24 Gig = 480 points, etc.

I agree. You might have some folks shun the contest
because they don't want to deal with calculating their
scores, though.

4) If the point of the effort is to promote activity,
serious consideration should be given to making the
rules ENCOURAGE real timesked co-ordination using the
Internet or telephone or even 2 meter FMrepeaters. ( I
don't believe I just said that!) Now I know
the&quot;purists&quot; are going to scream about cheating etc.,

I wouldn't be worried about cheating. To me, the
problem would be that some stations would not or could
not use the telephone or Internet to set up skeds,
whatever their reasons.

but this isn't theOlympics, or the NFL, or NASCAR. The
best way I know of to increaseactivity is to make it
easier to actually make a contact. First timersoften
need help to get going. If they are working in a
vacuum, theyalmost always give up and find something
else to do.

Actually, I like the idea of being able to call
someone on the telephone to set up a sked. For
instance, if a band opening is discovered, I would
want to be able to alert a distant station to get on.
But, I think that you might want to have two
categories. One category allows free use of the media
to set up skeds. The other would forbid it.

Of course, if thepoint of the effort is to create
another contest for contesters, thenthis sort of
co-ordination should be discouraged.

Why?

5) I believe start times should be very much earlier
than usual. Thebest tropo conditions occur around
sunrise. It's kinda foolish to makeearly risers wait
around until the sleepy heads get up and miss out
onthe best conditions. 1800z start times invariably
result in a flurry ofactivity at the start and long
range contacts are unlikely due to QRMon the popular
calling frequencies. Starting at 1200z on
Saturdaymorning would allow early risers to chance to
play under the best tropoconditions and also spread
out the rush at the gate we normally see. Wedo have
people in the Mountain time zone to consider as well.

What about people in the Eastern Time Zone? Do you
have everyone start at the same time locally? I've
always been under the impression that contest start
times favor the Eastern Seaboard. But, it really
doesn't matter what they are doing Back East. I like
your idea of starting early.

It turns out that I have very little stake in the
whole business. I'll get the bands I like if there's
activity of any kind, and if not, I'll just go read a
book.

I like interesting contests. If contests were more
interesting to operate on the higher bands, I would be
more inclined to gear up for those bands. I don't
think there really is a need for another
run-of-the-mill contest. Maybe a way can be found to
offer a difference. In any event, don't schedule this
contest to be within a month of any other major VHF
contest.

<POSTDATE> 2007-07-31T16:18:00 </POSTDATE>
Thanks for the suggestions so far. I decided to update things a bit and
start a new string.  That one had some tangents but was productive.

Here is a bit of history of how I got to this point.

Some have felt my last contest suggestion (2004 or 2005)  was too
complicated.  They were right.

This one will be count the number of grids away for QSO points and is it a
new multiplier?  The addition of a new band is a new multiplier by having
the capability of adding 3 more qsos per station per band and the chance to
add more grid multipliers.

When you explain it in text it can look difficult if you think of the
mechanics.  However if you follow the rules the mechanics take care of
itself.  Much like the other contests, when you get serious about posting a
big score you look at the rules closely.

I’m willing to run it myself, but I truly hope to get others involved. I
can’t promise a cab. Format right off the bat.  I don’t know how to create
one. I would hope after a contest or two we could work toward that. I talked
to one programmer of contest software and he thought the old contest could
be done on a program but I would have to prove a need for it.

All being said I do think the first idea I threw out there in 2005  had a
lot of issues where I was wrong about some things.

The goal here is to offer a different style of contest with different rules
and emphasis’s.

I could say its just for fun, but just for fun isn’t a contest and even if
it’s a three legged race at the boy scouts camp, someone will be too
competitive.  Someone will get their feelings hurt.

Also does an award from the society mean more than one from the ARRL?  The
bottom line is the value of the contest will be somewhat determined by the
person competing.  I could care less about the Tour de France, but it means
something to a bicyclist.

I think the main goal with this one is to make a contest more active with 3
modes.  Perhaps it will be too active on the east coast and opportunities
will be missed there.

Another goal is too make it more rewarding to learn CW (which I suck at  and
I passed the 13wpm 20 years ago) and encourage some growth in digital modes.
IE some of us focus on one of these modes all the time and it would spread
some understanding if we were familiar with each other’s niches.

The ARRL is a exponential scoring system with increasing scores for
frequency, multiplied by grid count.

I think this one is going to be less exponential with increased scoring for
distance multiplied by grid count (except for 6 meters).

After the posts I see 6 meters is important but breaks the spirit of
distance based scoring because it can be done relatively easy with a wet
noodle when 6 is open.  When E-skip opens up, every QSO will likely be 7
points because of the distance, that is sort of a multiplier in itself , if
we throw in 100 more multipliers than it becomes exponential like the ARRL
contest and CQ ones.

Again I want this to be a living contest willing to change if mistakes are
made in it’s creation.  IE change to a stew perry format when we have a
programmer who believes in the project. I’m not against that idea, I need
help getting there. If there’s someone in the club that can do this I’m open
to suggestions.

So I’ll change it to multipliers on each band above 6 meters no matter which
mode.

Also I don’t think I would exclude EME or meteor contacts because that
should be rewarded.

Unless someone flames me into a crispy chicken I could dump the no spotting
rules.  I know it happens now anyway, it’s one of the 40000 pound elephant
in the room the ARRL can’t control.  I think APRS or whatever its called
would be good on a rover.

Also how about a rolling start at 4 am local Saturday until 4 pm Sunday.
Friday night set up for portable and time to go home Sundays?

Thanks for the input.

Frank

Frank,

Thanks for that clarification.

For whatever reason, I had assumed that this was a proposal for a
regional contest principally for PNWVHFS members and our area of
influence.

With the inclusion of the east coast into the equation, it makes no
sense to view this as an &quot;activity generator&quot;. There certainly doesn't
seem to be any need to promote activity east of the Mississippi on any
band through 72 GHz.

It makes more sense to me to consider it to be just another contest
with a much improved scoring system. If I look at it that way, I don't
have much interest in it myself. I would show up if somebody threw that
party, but I wouldn't be motivated to bring the cake.

BTW, any scoring based on grid squares alone is flawed for a wide area
contest because of the size difference of the squares. Grids at 31°N
and almost half again longer than those at 48°N thereby decreasing the
number of potential multipliers for the southern states.

It makes more sense to me to consider it to be just another contest with a much improved scoring system. If I look at it that way, I don't have much interest in it myself. I would show up if somebody threw that party, but I wouldn't be motivated to bring the cake.

BTW, any scoring based on grid squares alone is flawed for a wide area contest because of the size difference of the squares. Grids at 31°N and almost half again longer than those at 48°N thereby decreasing the number of potential multipliers for the southern states.

Upon reviewing my earlier post in this thread, I realized that my choice
of wording might be misconstrued.

What I meant to convey was the impression I had that Paul, and others,
had an action orientated, competitive view of VHF contesting that
focused their attention away from the more tedious true weak signal
work. Whereas, myself and others like me, are just as much &quot;hopeless
cases&quot; except with the opposite polarization.

To state it more succinctly, &quot;different strokes for  different folks&quot;!

Yes, you could if you wanted to. There is no good way to compensate for
political/geographical bias. My statement was specifically in regard to
using grid squares in place of actual distance measurement for scoring
purposes although I probably didn't state it well.

Randy,

IT IS UNFAIR FOR ALL CONTESTS! Look at what they publish in QST. All you see are the same east/midwest stations who do to their GEOGRAPHY, dominate the top scores that get published.  If we had their propagation, we would have far more hams on vuf/uhf and in the contests be considerably more competitive on national basis.

The ARRL makes little attempt to level the playing field as they favor their friends in the east and always will. There are a lot of hams who will not turn in a score because of this bias. What ever happened to their &quot;special committee&quot; on VHF/UHF contests? I'll be very surprised (and grateful) if it results in a more level playing field and eliminates some of the inequities of the current system.

Having now stuck my foot in my mouth, my bottom line is that I would have little appreciation for any new contest that did not encourage through its design,  more hams to operate more bands (particularly &gt; 6 and 2 m) and more contacts on the higher bands. That includes permitting spotting that helps us rural folks presence be known so we can make more contacts and not spend hour on hour listening to nothing but white noise. (That's what I'll be doing this weekend!).

Off MY soapbox),
Greg

As I stated in the following post on that topic, that's not what I
meant to say. I regret the poor phrasing. In fact I agree with your
position.

I really have only one goal in Amateur Radio and that's to have fun. I
prefer not to limit my options in any regard and have managed to build
capability from 1.8 through 1296 in at least a minimal fashion on every
band. I have the capability to run nearly any mode you can think of
except the TV modes because I never know where my interest will take me
next.

If someone wants to have fun a different way that's OK, but I may
become frustrated because nobody want to play with me!

It's just a hobby.....

I think technology will catch up with us.  Id count QSOs by km if someone
wrote the program.

Also note the awards for longest qsos per mode and band. These are up for
grabs reguardless of total points.

We still classify scores by the 15 ARRL divisions and we have to quit
thinking nationally in our compairisons with each other.  thats an hf idea
and that sort of works there.  IE a adverage romanian station can hit well
over 100 contries on 160 meters where an adverage one in the northwest might
be lucky to get 40.

Again I said adverage.

&gt;itself.  Much like the other contests, when you get serious about posting a

&gt;talked
&gt;to one programmer of contest software and he thought the old contest could
&gt;be done on a program but I would have to prove a need for it.

&gt;All being said I do think the first idea I threw out there in 2005  had a
&gt;lot of issues where I was wrong about some things.

&gt;The goal here is to offer a different style of contest with different rules
&gt;and emphasis's.

&gt;I could say its just for fun, but just for fun isn't a contest and even if
&gt;it's a three legged race at the boy scouts camp, someone will be too
&gt;competitive.  Someone will get their feelings hurt.

&gt;Also does an award from the society mean more than one from the ARRL?  The
&gt;bottom line is the value of the contest will be somewhat determined by the
&gt;person competing.  I could care less about the Tour de France, but it means
&gt;something to a bicyclist.

&gt;I think the main goal with this one is to make a contest more active with 3
&gt;modes.  Perhaps it will be too active on the east coast and opportunities
&gt;will be missed there.

&gt;Another goal is too make it more rewarding to learn CW (which I suck at
&gt;and
&gt;I passed the 13wpm 20 years ago) and encourage some growth in digital
&gt;modes.
&gt;   IE some of us focus on one of these modes all the time and it would
&gt;spread
&gt;some understanding if we were familiar with each other's niches.

&gt;The ARRL is a exponential scoring system with increasing scores for
&gt;frequency, multiplied by grid count.

&gt;I think this one is going to be less exponential with increased scoring for
&gt;distance multiplied by grid count (except for 6 meters).

&gt;After the posts I see 6 meters is important but breaks the spirit of
&gt;distance based scoring because it can be done relatively easy with a wet
&gt;noodle when 6 is open.  When E-skip opens up, every QSO will likely be 7
&gt;points because of the distance, that is sort of a multiplier in itself , if
&gt;we throw in 100 more multipliers than it becomes exponential like the ARRL
&gt;contest and CQ ones.

&gt;Again I want this to be a living contest willing to change if mistakes are

&gt;programmer who believes in the project. I'm not against that idea, I need
&gt;help getting there. If there's someone in the club that can do this I'm
&gt;open
&gt;to suggestions.

&gt;So I'll change it to multipliers on each band above 6 meters no matter
&gt;which
&gt;mode.

&gt;Also I don't think I would exclude EME or meteor contacts because that
&gt;should be rewarded.

&gt;Unless someone flames me into a crispy chicken I could dump the no spotting
&gt;rules.  I know it happens now anyway, it's one of the 40000 pound elephant
&gt;in the room the ARRL can't control.  I think APRS or whatever its called
&gt;would be good on a rover.

&gt;Also how about a rolling start at 4 am local Saturday until 4 pm Sunday.
&gt;Friday night set up for portable and time to go home Sundays?

I will be fishing off the coast of Ucluelet Saturday and Sunday so will
bring my FT-817 along and you should be able to work me marine mobile from
Cn78 (Ucluelet) and Cn79 (Tofino/Radar Hill).  Most likely using a rubber
ducky, but over a salt water path, possibly hooking up the 5el LP beam.  On
air times will be spotty.  Fishing is excellent right now however.  Ham
radio activity will be inversely proportional to fishing activity! Mostly
likely will be working the Barkley Sound islands along the surf line to
about 20 miles out.  Hope to hear you (or anyone).

Greg and All,

Randy is just stating the facts. There is nothing
unfair about all this.

The reality is that we are competing against
ourselves, not guys on the East Coast. There is
nothing you can do to level the playing field. There
is no way you can change the rules so that a
mountaintop multi effort on Table Mountain can compete
with K8GP or W2SZ. Would I want to change the rules to
make it so that we could? Heck no. The only thing you
could do is write restrictive rules that affect them.
And, even if you did do that, you couldn't find a way
to guarantee a level field, anyway.

So, what do you do? You set your own goals in the
contest. The last two times our crew went to Table
Mountain, we scored in the top ten in the June
contest. We had been trying to achieve this for some
time and finally got it done. We placed 8th in the USA
and Canada both times. So, what would be the next
goal? To place 7th or better, of course. Will it ever
be possible to place 1st? Again, heck no.

So, do we go on a crusade to change the rules so that
we also have a chance at winning? No, this is not
realistic on VHF. Do we give up on contesting because
we can't win nationally? Of course not. The conditions
we work under dictate that we will never compete with
the East Coast. This is not bad, just reality.

Paul,

I understand the facts, I'm simply suggesting that we consider doing something DIFFERENT that other contests to better address the desires and needs of more persons than the dominant east coast block. That would require out of the box thinking that encourages new hams to participate and old hats to expand their interest by crafting contest scoring and rules to meet those goals.

I've seen several great ideas pass through this reflector that could potentially  contribute to expanded contest interest in our geography, they should be considered for incorporation.

Randy is just stating the facts. There is nothing
unfair about all this.

The reality is that we are competing against
ourselves, not guys on the East Coast. There is
nothing you can do to level the playing field. There
is no way you can change the rules so that a
mountaintop multi effort on Table Mountain can compete
with K8GP or W2SZ. Would I want to change the rules to
make it so that we could? Heck no. The only thing you
could do is write restrictive rules that affect them.
And, even if you did do that, you couldn't find a way
to guarantee a level field, anyway.

So, what do you do? You set your own goals in the
contest. The last two times our crew went to Table
Mountain, we scored in the top ten in the June
contest. We had been trying to achieve this for some
time and finally got it done. We placed 8th in the USA
and Canada both times. So, what would be the next
goal? To place 7th or better, of course. Will it ever
be possible to place 1st? Again, heck no.

So, do we go on a crusade to change the rules so that
we also have a chance at winning? No, this is not
realistic on VHF. Do we give up on contesting because
we can't win nationally? Of course not. The conditions
we work under dictate that we will never compete with

I certainly wouldn't mind  a &quot;different&quot; contest... The CQ
WW VHF test (and sprints) are an example of how things
&quot;used&quot; to be done in ARRL tests,  and another test could
demonstrate how things could be done in the future... sort
of a &quot;test contest&quot;...
the most important submission would be the soapbox:-)

Paul,

Likewise..... I hate when language gets in the way of communicating!

Specifically here goes a few examples -

Things not to allow in the contest--
-------------------------------------------------
1) a start time that disadvantages PNW tropo scatter contacts

2) Captive rovers that only benefit specific stations scores

3) A scoring formula that does not adequately encourage increased activity on the higher bands

Things to have in the contest
------------------------------------------
1) Permit spotting so that rural stations can make their presence known and permit making schedules in any manner before AND during the contest.

2) Scoring incentives to make it more than a single band contest so if 6m opens up. There are many way this could be accomplished but there should probably be a 6m only category for those who only want to focus on it alone.

3) Rover categories/rules/scoring  that  encourage them to make as many contacts as possible with non-rovers and rovers alike.

Things to consider
-----------------------------
1) distance multipliers for bands &gt; 2m with a graduating multiplier as the fq goes higher.

2) Dual contest. 6m only and all but 6m.

3) Mode multipliers. Allow multiple contacts with different modes, cw, ssb, digital, fm(?).

3) Multiplier for inter-grid contacts

There are probably more things to be considers than the above. The intent is in part to get away from the current system that permits gaming of the rules; i.e. run up a high Q total on 6m and get your multipliers from captive rovers who grid hop. I don't believe this happens  much in the PNW (if at all)  but certainly  does   in other parts of the country.

The other emphasis is to get guys interests in making contacts. I would much rather spend a hour trying to work a wet sider on 2m who has 50w and an 8 element beam than listen to white noise for an hour; or engage someone in the impossible attempt for an hour trying to work over the mountains on 1296.

Follow my drift now?

If we create a contest locally, it should certainly favor our
geographic/demographic advantages like...

Has anyone thought of any?

I've tried to come up with a system that would provide a reasonable
advantage to PNW stations but have been unable.

A system that offered all call district 7 stations a multiplier of 2 might
be a bit too obviously biased in our favor.

At least I don't live in Alaska (wink to Ed).
