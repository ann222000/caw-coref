Two words -- Gratitude &amp; Pride.

That's all I really need to say.

I have an everlasting sense of Gratitude to this group of beautiful,
wonderful, funny, eloquent and understanding people.

I have a great sense of Pride in myself for accomplishing something that
was attempted so many times before but ended in failure, for *one*
reason or *another*.

I love this group.

If I were ever to write an autobiography I could just cut and paste the
past 3 year's worth of my posts.  It's all there ... the move, Mrs A's
illness, the ups, the downs, the personal revelations ... It's been
quite a ride and quite a number of you have been here with me.  Hard to
believe you can love so many so much and to never have met them -- here
is a warm, thankful, gentle, loving hug to you all ((((You)))).

Pride.  What a fabulous thing.  It is a great thing.  It is something
that I really discovered when I quit.  It is something that I nurtured,
particularly with the help of this group.  Pride became a measure of my
Self-Worth.  I feel Good.  Life is Good.

So How Did I Do It?

Everyday read the posts -- drank bottled water, did deep breathing, some
yoga (really easy stuff), kept busy.  Posted everyday.  Felt the pride
growing.

In general, stay positive.  Life's not perfect but it offers us many
gifts in many many forms each and every day.  Look for them.  They're there.

So I think that's about it -- I love you guys so very very much.

Thank you all.

Cheers! Hugs! And High-Fives!

-- Marvie

I have been quit for 3 Years, 8 hours, 9 minutes and 16 seconds (1,095

saved 1 Month, 2 Weeks, 5 Days, 10 hours and 35 minutes of my life. My

Hugs to you. Thanks for inspiring all of us newbies.

Congrats you Android!
I remember when you arrived. I was going through a bit of stress myself.
Actually, it's been stress all along. I can't remember the last time I
wasn't stressed, but I'm sure it was a while before I quit smoking.
Life is about dealing with stressful things Marvie. I didn't realize that
before I quit though. Boy, did I get a surprise! And then, some people
expect everything to go completely fine while they quit?  Hahahahahaha!!!!
Congrats on the 3 Y's buddy. You are doing a great job!!!

:-p~~~~~~~ Keven OOF
Don't ever forget why you quit.

Marvin!  I know this is a second congrats, but I just had to respond
to your great posting.  You are definitely one of the major helpers
and an inspiration to me and all of us here in AS3Land.  Your positive
and heartwarming stories are uplifting and funny.  That you so readily
share both what is happening as well as your support means a lot to me
and many others here.  I do hope you can make it to the chatroom
tonight.  Wayne will be playing from 7pm to 9pm and I bet he might
cook up some goodies...

Hugs,

&gt;That's all I really need to say.

&gt;I have an everlasting sense of Gratitude to this group of beautiful,
&gt;wonderful, funny, eloquent and understanding people.

&gt;I have a great sense of Pride in myself for accomplishing something that
&gt;was attempted so many times before but ended in failure, for *one*
&gt;reason or *another*.

&gt;I love this group.

&gt;If I were ever to write an autobiography I could just cut and paste the
&gt;past 3 year's worth of my posts.  It's all there ... the move, Mrs A's
&gt;illness, the ups, the downs, the personal revelations ... It's been
&gt;quite a ride and quite a number of you have been here with me.  Hard to
&gt;believe you can love so many so much and to never have met them -- here
&gt;is a warm, thankful, gentle, loving hug to you all ((((You)))).

&gt;Pride.  What a fabulous thing.  It is a great thing.  It is something
&gt;that I really discovered when I quit.  It is something that I nurtured,
&gt;particularly with the help of this group.  Pride became a measure of my
&gt;Self-Worth.  I feel Good.  Life is Good.

&gt;So How Did I Do It?

&gt;Everyday read the posts -- drank bottled water, did deep breathing, some
&gt;yoga (really easy stuff), kept busy.  Posted everyday.  Felt the pride
&gt;growing.

&gt;In general, stay positive.  Life's not perfect but it offers us many
&gt;gifts in many many forms each and every day.  Look for them.  They're there.

&gt;So I think that's about it -- I love you guys so very very much.

&gt;Thank you all.

&gt;Cheers! Hugs! And High-Fives!

&gt; Actually, it's been stress all along. I can't remember the last time I
&gt; wasn't stressed, but I'm sure it was a while before I quit smoking.
&gt; Life is about dealing with stressful things Marvie. I didn't realize that
&gt; before I quit though. Boy, did I get a surprise! And then, some people
&gt; expect everything to go completely fine while they quit?  Hahahahahaha!!!!

Stress is a part of Life but without it where would the challenges come
from and the sense of accomplishment? We CAN do it.

I did manage to drop by this evening, but was thinking maybe another
