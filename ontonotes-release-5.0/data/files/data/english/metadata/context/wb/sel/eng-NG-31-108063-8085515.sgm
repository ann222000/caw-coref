When I bought my house there was a 5' x 12' fenced area that was used
for the pervious owner's dog.  There was no grass in the area and the
ground was covered with rock.  Around the fenced area were large
bushes that I believe were dog woods.  I wasn't really happy with this
section of the yard, so I took out the fence, removed most of the dog
woods and got the ground ready for grass.
I knew it was the wrong time of year to plant grass, but I was
impatient so I seeded it anyway.  That was July 4.  The grass came up
and looked nice, but so did the weeds.  I now have a terrible weed
problem that I'm not sure how to solve.  I'm thinking of buying some
weed killer to spray over the area but I don't know what would work
best.  Any suggestions on a good product for that purpose?

Mow it. Water it. Mow it. Water it. Mow it... You get the idea.

Eventually grass will crowd the weeds out, if you've been careful to mow
before the weeds can blossom and set seed. Grass will even eliminate
weeds that spread via underground runners.

It's a small area. Weed it by hand for now, so it's ready for seeding at the
proper time. Then, take care of the area BY THE BOOK, perfectly. The grass
will eventually dominate.

By the way, without knowing what weeds you're dealing with, it's hard to say
how bad they are. I have lots of purslane in my veg garden, and Ileave it in
place until I need to use the area. It spreads like a mat, and chokes out
other weeds. It pulls out very easily, and the soil underneath is in
beautiful shape. I recently found out that it's great in salads, and
contains all sorts of vitamins &amp; minerals.

Others are nasty, and I remove them ASAP. Get to know your weeds.

Clover, too. It quickly covers areas of my flower garden where I've cleared

So no one would hit the weeds with some kind of weed killer like weed-
be-gone or something like that?  I understand what you're saying about
the grass eventually chocking out the weeds, but right now it looks
like the other way around. That's what worries me.
Another question:  If I decide not to use the weed killer, could I cut
the grass and weeds really short in early Sept., overseed and then
spread a little top soil over the whole business?  Would that process
work to get rid of some of the weeds.

A lawn mower.

Years ago, when the kidlette was small and we were broke, we moved into a
house that had knee high weeds and saplings in a neglected, overgrown
backyard. I yanked out the saplings and mowed the weeds. Where there were
low spots I just filled it in with dirt and stomped it down, the grass took
over the bare spots all by its self. After a few years of just watering and
mowing (often enough so that the weeds didn't go to seed) we had a
beautiful, tough as nails, kid proof lawn. It was the neighborhood play spot
since nobody was hollering to &quot;stay off the lawn!&quot;.  Never did use any type
of fertilizer or pesticide on that stuff and it put the constantly worked on
&quot;golf green&quot; money pits in the rest of the neighborhood to shame.

I also hand picked the newly sprouting, tender dandelion leaves for salads
and sautéed greens....yummy! But then, you could probably sauté an old shoe
in shallots and butter and it would be yummy ;)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When I bought my house there was a 5' x 12' fenced area that was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; used
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the pervious owner's dog.  There was no grass in the area and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ground was covered with rock.  Around the fenced area were large
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bushes that I believe were dog woods.  I wasn't really happy with
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of the yard, so I took out the fence, removed most of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dog
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; woods and got the ground ready for grass.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I knew it was the wrong time of year to plant grass, but I was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; impatient so I seeded it anyway.  That was July 4.  The grass came
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; up
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and looked nice, but so did the weeds.  I now have a terrible weed
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem that I'm not sure how to solve.  I'm thinking of buying
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; weed killer to spray over the area but I don't know what would
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; best.  Any suggestions on a good product for that purpose?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It's a small area. Weed it by hand for now, so it's ready for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; seeding at
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; proper time. Then, take care of the area BY THE BOOK, perfectly. The
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; grass
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; will eventually dominate.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, without knowing what weeds you're dealing with, it's
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hard to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how bad they are. I have lots of purslane in my veg garden, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ileave it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; place until I need to use the area. It spreads like a mat, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; chokes out
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other weeds. It pulls out very easily, and the soil underneath is in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; beautiful shape. I recently found out that it's great in salads, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; contains all sorts of vitamins &amp; minerals.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Others are nasty, and I remove them ASAP. Get to know your weeds.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sound Advice!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill who loves wild purslane and has also purchased seed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Clover, too. It quickly covers areas of my flower garden where I've
&gt;&gt; &gt; cleared
&gt;&gt; &gt; weeds, but waited too long to plant something. It pulls out easily the
&gt;&gt; &gt; day
&gt;&gt; &gt; after watering or rain, and the soil underneath is like a dream.

&gt;&gt; I just knew we'd get smarter, eventually.

&gt; So no one would hit the weeds with some kind of weed killer like weed-
&gt; be-gone or something like that?  I understand what you're saying about
&gt; the grass eventually chocking out the weeds, but right now it looks
&gt; like the other way around. That's what worries me.
&gt; Another question:  If I decide not to use the weed killer, could I cut
&gt; the grass and weeds really short in early Sept., overseed and then
&gt; spread a little top soil over the whole business?  Would that process
&gt; work to get rid of some of the weeds.

Before you get any more answers, tell me what you thought about getting down
on your knees and hand weeding your VERY SMALL AREA. You didn't respond to
that idea earlier.

Also, tell me what kinds of hand weeding tools you now own.

Hand pull, or wipe each weed individually with glyphosate.  Most
of the broad leaf selectives have at least a 3 week witholding period before
you can reseed, which puts you well into the time I like to seed in
most areas of the US.

If you didn't dig or rototill before your summer renovation, consider
mowing the current plot as short as possible, and then digging it over
and reseeding -- especially with a significant amount of clay in the
soil.  Even little dog feet can do a good job of squishing out the air
space from soils over time, and it'd be easier to do a good aeration
when you're renovating.

Wow, a lot of snarky comments here.  Actually I did think about
getting on hands and knees and seeing how many of the weeds I could
get pulled that way.  I'm a little affraid that I'll end up pulling a
lot of grass out too because many of the weeds are vine-like.  But I
assume the response to that would be that the grass will spread and
fill any bare spot left where grass was pulled out.
What do you think about my idea about cutting short and overseeding
the weeds and grass in a couple weeks?
Before I seeded I did dig the entire area so I don't believe soil
compaction is a problem.

Not snarky at all. If you are presented with ideas, it's expected that you
will respond to them. You've gotten relatively few responses, so it's not
like it's a monumental task to respond.

Your question about the timing for seeding cannot be answered unless we know
where you live. It's best done in cool weather, unless you are willing to
cover the entire area with burlap, and mist it one or three times a day,
depending on heat, wind, etc.

Where do you live? City &amp; state, please.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Wow, a lot of snarky comments here.  Actually I did think about
&gt;&gt; &gt; getting on hands and knees and seeing how many of the weeds I could
&gt;&gt; &gt; get pulled that way.  I'm a little affraid that I'll end up pulling a
&gt;&gt; &gt; lot of grass out too because many of the weeds are vine-like.  But I
&gt;&gt; &gt; assume the response to that would be that the grass will spread and
&gt;&gt; &gt; fill any bare spot left where grass was pulled out.
&gt;&gt; &gt; What do you think about my idea about cutting short and overseeding
&gt;&gt; &gt; the weeds and grass in a couple weeks?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Before I seeded I did dig the entire area so I don't believe soil
&gt;&gt; &gt; compaction is a problem.

&gt;&gt; Not snarky at all. If you are presented with ideas, it's expected that
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; will respond to them. You've gotten relatively few responses, so it's not
&gt;&gt; like it's a monumental task to respond.

&gt;&gt; Your question about the timing for seeding cannot be answered unless we
&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt; where you live. It's best done in cool weather, unless you are willing to
&gt;&gt; cover the entire area with burlap, and mist it one or three times a day,
&gt;&gt; depending on heat, wind, etc.

&gt;&gt; Where do you live? City &amp; state, please.- Hide quoted text -

In that case, you'll hand weed until the middle of September, and then
reseed. As far as compacting the soil, any time you walk on soil that's not
hosting a good root system from one plant or another, you're compacting it.
Work from the middle of the area to the outside. If you must return to the
middle before the grass is really rockin', place a long board across it.
