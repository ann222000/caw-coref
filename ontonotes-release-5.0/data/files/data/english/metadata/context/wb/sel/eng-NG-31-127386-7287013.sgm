That's right Angel....It was the woman, Eve, that
tricked Adam into eating the "apple".

Therefore all women are evil by their nature.

Hashem is a vengeful God.

Are you a HOHA ?

7 matches for six.... 6 matches for seven

Coincidence?

HOHA

It caused them to eXperience autoerotic orgasm...

Spilling the virgin seed of both.......

You are, evidently...

A TwonkyHOHA......

Welcome.....

Angel hasn't made up her mind...

Ordained.....by Lucifer's boss.....

If Lucifer wanted to play God. There were rules......

No 7 days....
No Almighty.....
No Kingdom....
No Legions....
No Son......

He was permitted....
To eXalt himself...
Seed his own race/species....
Picking a prophet.....
Inspiring his own Scripture....
Pick an angel of HaShem, to intercede......

He used the angel Gabriel....to help....

"Gabriel is an Archangel. Big and muscular...."

He gave Mohammad an incantation, before Mo wrote the
Koran....

Repeat three times; "Man was made from clots of blood."
(No doubt Lucifer came up with that.)

I think those clots came from Hagar's pubic hair....

Obviously for Lucifer's future Godhood of Allah, morphed
from al-llah, Mo's God of his and his brethren's, Haniff sect.

Mo didn't like the polytheism of al-llah's three goddess daughters.
And the worship of them....

He was envious of Israel's Almighty God......

Lucifer, who in the devil and Satan, was the tempter in Scripture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Likewise.....

~>
TownkyHOHA.....

XtemeTwonkyHOHA....

With XtremePrejudice and no fucking mercy....

The God of Islam is a rogue angel of HaShem.....
Competing with and against Him, in Allah. And is
entrenched in mankind's psyche as the devil and Satan.
Whom are in, and come from, Lucifer, and his adversarial
psyche and doings against the Christ, HaShem, and man.
And all that is good on the Earth, and of that which is in,
and comes from, the Kingdom....

Like crop markings....

Angels interacting in the fields, on a global scale....
Taking HaShem's share of the crops (retroactively), every
year, for which He bargained, with man...

Unlike Lucifer's interaction with suichomicidal death
markings, on the Â on a global scale, in the streets....

And the introduction of Bower & Chorley....
Strictly the work of the Lucifer ass kisser mainstreamer
Rupert Murdoch......

Why? Why do you destroy the true intent of the crop markings?

I don't know how the fuck you get away with deceiving as many
people as you do. Apathy about everything is what you appeal to.

So that could eXplain it.....

Bunch of dummies.....

WAKE UP! SLAP SLAP KICK SLAP

Good & Evil...and the knowledge....thereof........
