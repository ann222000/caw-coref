If i remove that red bull, it kinda reminds me of the JPS Lotus 97
form that angle. More curves, a lower rear wing and otherwise entirely
different, but still, it reminds me of it. ;-)
Of course, back then, that sponsorship would have been around 2000
cartons of cigarettes.

I think the Toyota looks pretty good too.

Sweet.  One of the things I am really excited to see this year is how
McLaren fare without Newey versus how Red Bull does.  I wish Red Bull
had a factory engine deal like a full BMW deal where they got equal
motors to the BMW (sauber) factory team or an equal Toyo or Honda.

Williams has been in freefall since they lost Adrian.  Williams were do
okay for a time with JPM and Ralf in the early BMW years.  It is pretty
easy to sink in F1 by losing sponsorship money.

Anyone know if Newey can do any work on the Toro Rosso?  Does
FIA/FOCA/Bernie have a rule about sharing designs?  I know they bitched
years ago when the Ligier was almost a copy of the Benetton due to
Frank Dernie/Falvio/Walkisnhaw connection.  I forget the details.

More recently the Toyota was awafully simliar to the Ferrari due to
some info from a hard drive.

I forgot that Red Bull has Renault engines this year.  Adrian Newey
designed car + Reanult engines = Could be DC's year.  Don't be suprised
if Red Bull embarasses McLaren and many other teams.

If Renault is doing a customer deal like they did with Benetton and
Williams then Red Bull may get an engine eual to the Renault factory
team.

Dunno..

3.10.1 No part of the car behind the rear wheel centre line may be
more than 800mm above the reference plane.
[This hasn't changed, so it doesn't look like the wings are clipped,
but wait, there is more..]

[&lt;snip&gt;]

3.10.5 No part of the car between 75mm and 480mm from the car
centre line may be more than 500mm behind the rear wheel centre
line. Any parts of the car less than 75mm from the car centre line
and more than 500mm behind the rear wheel centre line must be
situated between 250mm and 500mm 200mm and 400mm above
the reference plane.
[The 250-500 is crossed out as being the old rule and the 200-400 is
highlighted being the new rule, so surely that would include a
reduction in effective rear wing height ? Or rabbi gitting dwunk ?]

3.10.6 In side view, the projected area of any bodywork lying
between 300mm and 800mm above the reference plane and
between the rear wheel centre line and a point 600mm behind it
must be greater than 230 000 mm².
[A main beam and a sail, no doubt]

I know i've had a rough two weeks, but these b(lo)ody rules gave me a
headache.

I would like all replies to this in clear English, with every 10th
word in Latin if every 4th word is Italian, provided that every 3rd

You need to spend time in Vancouver BC Canada.

I asked a friend where the 'subway' was a few years back, and his answer was
clear:

"go out the door, turn right, hitch a ride for 5,000 kilometres east until you
get to Toronto, then buy a ticket at Kennedy Station"

That's when I understood that the only way out of the party was to call a taxi.

It does LOOK nice, visually at least, but it doesn't look very FAST if
you ask me.  More pics available at www.formula1.com , including a few
close-ups.  From there they just don't seem to have many of the
advancements we've seen from other teams to improve downforce.  Now
admittedly these things are always tough to tell from simply looking
at pictures, but the engine cover looks high and the rear wing low.
The front wing also looks very early-2005 styled, missing the extra
winglets and curves we've seen all other front wings grow in the past
two seasons.

Perhaps the car just is missing some finishing touches still?  Or
maybe it's a low-downforce package? (seems unlikely with teh first
race being in Melbourne).  Or maybe they've just come up with some new
methods to create downforce?  I guess we'll have to wait for another
month and a half to find out!

&gt; &gt; If Renault is doing a customer deal like they did with Benetton and
&gt; &gt; Williams then Red Bull may get an engine eual to the Renault factory
&gt; &gt; team.

&gt; Apparently that's exactly what Renault are doing, on the grounds that 4
&gt; machines running per race gives them twice as much development data as 2.
