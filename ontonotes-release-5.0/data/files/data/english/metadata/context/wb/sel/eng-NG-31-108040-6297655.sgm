SPOILERS for _Age of Worms_ module #2.

We did the next bit of _Age of Worms_, which I'd predicted to be
a TPK.

It wasn't.  It didn't look much like either of us had expected,
either.

Part I (Temple of Hextor):

We'd agreed without much discussion to use the v3.0 version of the
Darkness spell (which makes things pitch dark) and not the v3.5
(which makes them gloomy with 20% concealment, and actually
illuminates a naturally dark area).  One of the PCs is of a strange
class (warlock) from one of the expansion books and sees in
magical darkness like a demon.  When an NPC cast Darkness on
a coin and threw it on her, she picked it up and carried it
around.  For the next ten minutes she effectively had a
better-than-Improved-Invisibility advantage, and she used it
ruthlessly.  This screwed up the rest of the PCs nearly
as badly as the enemies; the warlock essentially won singlehanded
except for the final fight against the High Priest, which came
down to a two-on-one fight between him and two PCs.  One of the
PCs was badly hurt but not killed.  All other foes were killed
singlehandedly by the warlock with ranged magical damage.  No
enemy was ever able to target her.

Much bitching from the player about armor class; his PCs had an
inordinately hard time hitting.  The warlock hits touch
AC and even without the darkness she would have been doing most
of the damage.

The Darkness advantage was so great that I think the best approach
to this scenario would have been for the warlock to do it by
herself once the first three rooms were finished.  It was somewhat
interesting watching her do it, but the player started to become
snappy (I would call one of the other PCs on the initiative
chart, and he would snap "Does nothing, just like last round" at
me).  With multiple players I think this would have been a severe
problem.

Part II (Grimlock caves):

The PCs questioned the Hextorites, got high rolls and were able to
get a fair idea how the grimlocks were situated.  They killed
five by impersonating the Hextorites and pretending to have a food
shipment.  Then they went in, and fought through all the rest.

The two boss fights at the end were solved with Silence, looking
exactly the same, oddly, as the Darkness effect earlier:  grimlocks
"see" with sound, so are totally blind in Silence, and this is
catastrophic.

The earlier fights (grimlocks with levels of fighter or barbarian,
krenshars, chokers) gave the PCs considerable trouble and one was
taken to -8 but lived.

The thing I really noticed about this scenario was that, even though
we had agreed to play it as it was written, and I had told the
player that I thought it was too hard, he was continually offended
by how hard it was.  I had to keep looking up rules for him.
We found one clear rules violation:  the module author beefed up
the grimlocks by giving them shields (making them AC20 and very
hard for the PCs to hit) but left their damage at the two-handed
weapon level.  The player also felt that grimlocks should not be
CR1 (I tend to agree).

I kept saying "You asked me to play it as written" because I
felt so defensive.  I was also bothered by lots of logic problems:
I had to work hard to hide from the player the fact that the
Hextorites apparently never sleep (everyone is on watch all the
time) and that the grimlocks get their food supplies by walking
past two hungry monsters.

By the end the player was snapping at me whenever I made a rules
call against his PCs, which he usually doesn't do.  It was
a very stressful session to run.  The PCs "did fine" but the player
and GM didn't seem to be enjoying themselves.

The player's reaction was to tell me that he didn't think his
PC party would be viable past a few more levels, due to less than
optimal character design choices, and I ought to "do something
about that" or he was going to have to abandon these PCs and do
more heavily optimized ones.  He also complained that he was
not satisfied with his characterizations.

Toward the end I was forcing myself, with gritted teeth, not to
fudge.

Despite the outcome, I'll stand by my initial evaluation:  these
are too hard for us at the stated levels.  I don't care too much
about the spell-dominated outcomes, though if it turns out to be
standard for the warlock to win every scenario single-handed (she
will get Darkness at will in a few levels) we're likely to be
unhappy.  But the amount of player bitching was hard to take.  I
don't fault my player for it.  I would have felt the same.

I have to say, your post reminded me of why I refuse to play AD&amp;D as
written.  Optimal tactics are all about finding exploitative uses of
things like the uses of darkness and silence that you mention.  I don't
fault your player for them, but I'm really not interested in a system
that has so little use for real tactics.

I would note that perhaps you discovered why version 3.5 darkness was
changed from version 3.0.

It was disappointing.  We've had some fights which were much more about
manuver tactics and much less about one-spell-beats-everything.  I was
rather surprised to see that at this level (4th) as in my experience
it's a much worse problem later on, and dominates after 9th level.

No doubt of it.  We are discussing various fixes.  My player is violently
adverse to the v3.5 version as written because the idea that casting
Darkness in a dark room makes it *lighter*--you can in fact cast this
on a lantern and use it as a light source--offends him.  But one possibility
is to just rename the spell "Darklight" or "Gloom."

No they're not.

Exploitative uses of the rules has a much more negative term like

Went back and looks at the Mary's post which sparked that statement and need
to clarify: That use wasn't exploitative as such (because as far as I know,
it was allowed by the rules) and thus wouldn't count as power-gaming in 3.0
which was the agreed upon version of the spell.

I'm no sure I'd use the word tactics either however. Spell usage and combos
are more about finding 'holes' in the game structure (as this case shows)
than supporting tactics. This type of  intensely unsporting system behavior
is also a reason that I long ago abandoned D&amp;D.

Or just rule that the spell darkens the area down to that light condition

Nearly all 2HD humanoids are CR 1. There is the rough rule to give
+50% XP for any monsters that have a signifigant advantage over their
default stats.

Sheilds are pretty easy to sunder, but that depends on feats for
safety. It's probably a solid tactic for the front line to make a wall
of full defence (low level PCs should hit AC 22 easy) and have the
Warlock pick them off one at a time.

Just out of interest, how many encounters does your group do
between exits? There's a good string of EL 3 and EL 4 ones there, and
the 4th EL = APL in a day is supposed to wipe out your resources.

I think this is a great solution but then it's really a "Darken" spell and

This version of Darkness is, in my opinion, much too powerful. It looks
as if the other PCs should have just hung back and let the Warlock do
her thing. When that looks like the best tactic it means that the RPG
convention of "the party" is in trouble. I have played in campaigns
where this didn't bother anyone and we DID sometimes let someone solo
while we waited to cover her or his escape. Most of the time it wasn't
that good.

Usually, it would have been. Very few people can enjoy playing an

character changes from session to session, it can be tolerable.

This was no spoiler for the Temple but it brings up some very
interesting points about play balance, a concept I don't usually
consider much, and adventure design. Your warlock, probly less so with
the newer version of the spell, sounds like the "solution" to the
seeming terrible danger of this part of the module. The temple looks
much harder than it turns out to be. Maybe it was supposed to.

It looks tough enough to be distracting but it also looks like it is

for the players or partly that.

They did all of the described encounters in one pass, taking careful
account of their own resources.

For roleplaying reasons, it seemed unreasonable to do them
one or two encounters at a time:  it was hard to imagine, given
the setup, that the NPCs would neither improve their position
nor retaliate against the PCs' allies.  The module assumes that the
PCs don't care what happens to the NPCs most deeply in the grip of
the cultists, but in our case, those NPCs are the parents of two
of the PCs, and the PCs do care.

I don't think Hextor would have been easier in multiple passes.
The PCs used Darkness, which they cannot cast, to make it work.
The grimlocks would have been, because Silence is a perfect
defense against them but only lasts long enough for 1-2 encounters.
But it is hard to imagine that the third faction wouldn't do
anything in the meantime.  And the grimlock casters might also
get smart and cast Darkness themselves (it was foolish of
them not to be carrying it in the first place).

As the PCs have a wand of CLW, healing/hit points were not an issue;
they were at full hp for every encounter.

My experience is that at these levels, encounters do not wipe out
your resources all that quickly:  the PC deaths come from either
single too-hard encounters or from dice, not from resource exhaustion.
(This assumes the party doesn't push past the end of their spells,
which this one hadn't, and still hasn't.  They are, however, running
a bit low and are out of alchemist's fire.  They may retreat now and
hope that the remaining cultists are too few to mount an effective
response.)

The module seems to assume that the PCs can take this room by
room and nothing will ever change, but my player won't tolerate
that kind of thing.

Will, I'm not really sure how I should take your comments:  did you
miss the point, earlier in the thread, that the player had asked
me to run the module exactly as written?  So a lot of your "you did
this wrong...you did that wrong" were straight from module and rules,
not something that (by the agreement) I could have changed.

Also, since I was reporting on how the combat had gone, it's
natural that I didn't include a whole lot of roleplaying notes:
that wasn't central to the point I was trying to make.  It seems
a bit offensive to conclude that there wasn't any roleplaying going
on.

I'm not going to reply in any detail as it seems we're totally on

It looks set out for three runs at a minimum, and they'd each be
insanely hard days for a standard party. I can agree that any partially

Then it's not the module that's too hard, it's the conditions

to zip in and do the mission without hitting most of the fights, so
insisting the missions must be completed in the one run is harsh.

Your 10th level characters in a 5th level module post earlier is a
similar thing, doing what would normally be a level or two worth of
adventure in one run is about five or six times as hard as expected in DnD.

Your house rule gimped the whole Hextor bunch, and will do the same

supposed to be harder to cast, of much shorter duration, and be avilable

Considering your house rules, that's true. It's a 3.5 module, and

That, combined with a Warlock (even without the cheesy Darkness
mod), changes the one day gameplay somewhat. I suppose you don't have a
lot of resources that don't just come back next fight.

There's a fair bit of character class stuff coming out from WotC
that's balanced per fight rather than per day lately. They're trying to
cut back on the impact of a spellcaster or Psion that dumps everything
in one fight, but making it easier and easier to just keep on going.

That "unstated" bothers me a lot.  There are detailed tactics for
each section individually, but nothing beyond that.  There are a lot
of suggestions that the cult *should* act:  the 6th and 7th level NPCs
in town think they will, and those folks aren't stupid.  But nothing
on how they'll act, to help the GM out if the PCs do as you suggest.

At a minimum, guarding the single point of access to the complex
would seem like a good idea!  Anyone coming down in that elevator
should be very vulnerable.  If guard duty is too boring for live
people, undead could be tried, with a ready response force nearby.
And a Glyph or so wouldn't go amiss, or a booby trap.  A 200'
elevator sounds like an awfully appealing spot for a booby trap.

Admittedly the Hextorites are the military brains of the bunch, and
the player quite reasonably hit them first.  But the Vecnites
aren't stupid either.

I'm also bothered by the fact that nobody apparently ever sleeps, or
changes guard, or anything like that--the descriptions are 100%
static.  *Were* they expecting the PCs to hit it repeatedly?  If
so, it should really have a non-static description.  At a minimum,
when are the food deliveries, and who receives them?  Is the night
guard different from the day guard?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I didn't insist; the player could have tackled it the way you suggest,
though the Vecna-cultists would certainly have had *some* kind of
response.  The player insisted, saying flatly, "I can't maintain
suspension of disbelief doing this one room at a time."

And yes, it's a disadvantage that the PCs have family and connections
in Diamond Lake.  I warned the player about this, but he finds it's
a lot more interesting that way.  There are several "Motivate the
PCs by threatening NPCs they care about" scenario hooks in _Worms_
but one has the impression that they are meant to give the players
an *excuse* for doing the adventure the GM wants, because at every
other turn the module undercuts that kind of motivation.

Yes.  I know I have to fix that rule, and we have a couple of proposals
on the table to do so.

I think I might have spotted it earlier if the PCs could *cast* Darkness,

I think this comes partly from the expectation that of course all of
the PCs have to have something useful to do in each encounter.  Silence
can really hurt the PC spellcasters, but if you know that, and there
isn't a player bitching about it, you can very usefully have two fighters
with a Silence up front, and the rest of the party (including another
demi-fighter as bodyguard) in back, outside the Silence.  This is how my
player did the last two grimlock encounters.  Sometimes the back group
could contribute, sometimes not, depending on terrain, but when they
couldn't they just waited.

Maybe.  The two PC deaths were against melee foes that killed them in
one action each.  They moved faster than the PCs and had much better
to-hit rolls.  More buffs might have helped, but as I recall, the PCs
were fresh when they hit that.

Similarly, the near-death in the grimlock caves was a hidden monster
that no one had Spotted nailing a PC late in the movement order, and
taking him down in a round.  He had Mage Armor, but it wasn't enough;
at these levels he's not likely to have too much more.

(I said this to the player, who disagreed.  "If I was playing one-room-
per-day, the other 5 PCs would never have been in that room at all.  We
would put all the buffs on one PC and have her search every square in
the room."  So I guess if you are willing to do that, yes, you can greatly
reduce mortality.)

I am coming to think my sense of "too hard" is not just threat level,
it's other things.  In _SCAP_ my rogue hit the first scenario and
was so clearly outclassed by all locks and traps that she quit trying,
and never really tried again until 7th or 8th level.  Similarly, I'm
concerned that Jon's PCs will adopt an attitude of "We are so outclassed
as fighters, we can only ever win by spell-backed tactics, so that's
all we do."  He's likely to find such PCs "unheroic" (in the capability
sense, not the courage/sacrifice sense) and ultimately unsatisfying.

A mindset of "No one go into the room until the one PC whom we've poured
backing magic into has searched it; and then we'll go home and rest up"
is rather...it's hard to combine it with thinking of the PCs as real
adventurers with real goals, at least for me.

I put this to the player, who sighed and said, "They're describing Neverwinter
Nights.  I just finished playing that, and it was okay, but I hoped for
more from D&amp;D.  Of course you can have no enemy responses and no connection
to any of the NPCs, but my suspension of disbelief goes right out the
window."

So yes, I think you've hit the nail on the head, but it's not a "problem"
that we can fix.  We enjoy the sense of a world being there that was, for
me, so badly missing in Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate--that you can't
just walk away from any threat and never worry what it will do, that there
are NPCs whose lives you really care about and who are genuinely at
risk.

I didn't understand how many levels worth of disadvantage that is.  Now I
do:  a valuable lesson.

My player is bummed.  He was interested in trying to play _Worms_ "straight",
at its stated levels and without GM fudging, as a challenge.  But he's not
so interested if doing so requires abandoning PC or NPC complexities that
he enjoys, and I'm afraid that's the choice we face.

I felt that way about SCAP for a while too, but the module broke me of it;
tactical challenge is all very well but the price is way too high.  I know
that I would not have enjoyed taking 2 weeks to kill the monsters in the
Night of Terror one at a time; my own suspension of disbelief would not
have survived it.  (There's still a town there, with 32 hellhounds roaming
the streets burning things down deliberately?  There are still people, with
bone devils hunting them for sport?  And the enemy neither accomplishes
anything serious on their own plans, nor locates and kills the PCs?)  We
did that in two sweeps, taking two days at it, but cleaning up the most
town-killing stuff in the first night.  *That* felt like the kind of heroics
(again, capability sense, not moral sense) I'd play a high-end fantasy game for.

It's unfair of me, of course, to expect the modules to support my play
style.  But it does seem strange that they waste paper on things like
NPC personality sketches, if the best thing to do is ignore them.

Okay, that's clearer, thanks.

I am sure they anticipated grimlocks+Silence.  I would be shocked

it's very, very unlikely that a party could do it.  Seeing in magical
darkness is otherwise excruciatingly rare in the system, limited to
devils and a few monsters with sonar.  And a warlock of Athas' level
can't actually have both Darkness and See in Magical Darkness; it
just happened that an NPC provided the missing link for her.

The author didn't say how he expected the grimlocks to go, but he did
say how he expected easy wins over the Hextorites to go:  PCs get
ahead of the Hextorite response and defeat them in detail.  I was
surprised that it was still easy even after the player allowed the
Hextorites to mostly get together (though he did *not* let them loose
the giant boar, and a good thing, too).

I didn't mind the surprise solutions, though the Darkness thing needs to
be fixed (a bad rules call on our part).  I minded the player's griping
a lot more.  He has clarified that the real stickler for him was the
mis-rating of the grimlocks.  They break many system design rules about
what a monster of their type should be like, but offer no EXP bonus for
their nonconformity, and this made him feel cheated.  "If the system
wants me to treat this like a video game, at least it should be a
*fair* video game."

I think I personally was the most offended by descriptions which repeatedly
described how the PCs would see a grimlock and notice the tattoos and
ritual scars on its chest.  Then you'd look down at the equipment list
and notice that the grimlock is in full plate armor.  Unless you check
every single description before reading it, this produces a strong
impression in the player's mind that the GM is lying deliberately about
the monster's armor; and if the player assumes from the description
that it's unarmored, he can get screwed for no reason.  Plate armor is
not exactly a subtle visual detail!

This probably means that the person writing description and the
person writing stat blocks weren't talking to each other.  I wish Paizo had
put this out as a hardback, as they seem to do more copy-editing on the
hardback versions than the magazine versions.

Can Trolls see in magical darkness anymore? They could at one time, in

would be impossible in any form of D&amp;D that I know of, not so in
RuneQuest or in our local rules. If you had a PC who could naturally
see in magical darkness, all you would need is the NPC who provided the
Darkness spell. Even if they provided the NPC and the spell, it looks
unlikely that they expected that you could do this. If, however, they
anticipated that the PCs would use Silence versus the Grimlocks,
wouldn't  that have reduced the threat-level a great deal from what one

Right. Of course, a player MIGHT claiim that this combination meant
that his character had developed X-Ray vision. The GM who reads the
description aloud without checking it against the stat blocks is going
to have a problem and checking the written description against the stat
block, time after time, is much more like drudgery and almost as
time-consuming as writing ones own adventures.

If one has agreed to play "by the rules" it's hard to do this, though
in the end we did go back and give what we both considered to be the
correct (but non-book) EXP.

There are some strange decisions in the Monster Manual; I hoped they
would fix them all in v3.5 but they didn't.  It's particularly a problem
since spells like Polymorph, plus the ability to take monster races as
PCs, mean that the players may directly stress any bad decisions in
the Monster Manual.

My first _City of the Spider Queen_ game was almost completely determined
by the mis-leveling of one of the angels (planetar? solar? I forget) which
allows the PCs to summon it with a modestly powerful spell, even though
it's much more powerful than that.  (A 16th level cleric is CR16.  I don't
know how something with the full spellcasting of a 16th level cleric,
plus a whole bunch more special powers, could be CR15.  I guess some of
the AD&amp;D game designers think of clerical casting as useless, but that
has not been my experience.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;probably give lots of EXP to the character that did the Silence and

You're right, that would really have angered him.  Me, too.  I'd take
the GM's unspoken message to be "I'm punishing you for using that tactic,
don't do it again" and I'd wonder why.

What would you be trying to say or do with this?  If one PC is
disproportionately powerful and effective, surely giving them more EXP
than the others is not really moving toward a solution.  Are you
trying to enlist the other players into forcing that player to tone
down his PC?  (Wouldn't work in a one-player dynamic, of course.)  Or
is it purely a realism consideration?  Do you think the PC who cast
the Silence learned more than the PCs who took advantage of it?  (The
PC who cast the Silence then hung back and did little or nothing all
fight.)

I don't ever give differential EXP.  I have found this to be a source of
bad feelings, even in single-player games and much more in multi-player
games, and not much else.  But my own preference (in contrast to my
player's) is not to give EXP at all but to give levels when it seems
appropriate.  The player won't accept this because it interferes with
use of AD&amp;D's magic-item-creation system and he is interested in the
resource-management aspects of that system.

I rather like being able to say to the GM, "My PCs have finally taken
up the responsibility of being heroes, not just adventurers; I think
they should go up a level now."  (That was 9th level in SCAP.)  Or,
just as often, "Nothing has really changed, and they haven't settled
into the current level yet, so don't."

Might be a bone of contention in multi-player, though.  I haven't tried
it there.

This was a pretty common complaint, and not just in the context of City
of the Spider Queen. I think they toned down the Planar Ally spells
quite a bit in 3.5, just FYI.

There is also extensive errata to Polymorph available somewhere on
WotC's Web site, though I haven't examined it closely enough to know
whether it would address your issues with it.

(BTW, they dropped the "A" in "D&amp;D" when 3E came out, since there is no
longer a basic version for it to be an advanced counterpart *of*...)

&gt; would fix them all in v3.5 but they didn't.  It's particularly a problem
&gt; since spells like Polymorph, plus the ability to take monster races as
&gt; PCs, mean that the players may directly stress any bad decisions in
&gt; the Monster Manual.

&gt; My first _City of the Spider Queen_ game was almost completely determined
&gt; by the mis-leveling of one of the angels (planetar? solar? I forget) which
&gt; allows the PCs to summon it with a modestly powerful spell, even though
&gt; it's much more powerful than that.  (A 16th level cleric is CR16.  I don't
&gt; know how something with the full spellcasting of a 16th level cleric,
&gt; plus a whole bunch more special powers, could be CR15.  I guess some of
&gt; the AD&amp;D game designers think of clerical casting as useless, but that
&gt; has not been my experience.)

That seems odd enough to be a misprint but I gather it isn't. I
remember clerics as being very useful characters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;I would probably have REALLY angered him because I would
&gt; &gt;probably give lots of EXP to the character that did the Silence and
&gt; &gt;less for the others.

&gt; You're right, that would really have angered him.  Me, too.  I'd take
&gt; the GM's unspoken message to be &quot;I'm punishing you for using that tactic,
&gt; don't do it again&quot; and I'd wonder why.
">

It isn't a punishment. It is a reward for being an effective character.
When one spell makes the fight a great deal easier, it seems pretty
clear that one _could_ justify this approach. If the group isn't used
to it and/or objects strongly, I can also see not doing it that way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What would you be trying to say or do with this?  If one PC is
&gt; disproportionately powerful and effective, surely giving them more EXP
&gt; than the others is not really moving toward a solution.
">

I don't think powerful characters are a problem needing a solution.
However, this character doesn't seem more powerul. He just had a more
useful spell in this situation. Since that could easily even out, or
nearly so, over time, the equal EXP award is also reasonable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Are you
&gt; trying to enlist the other players into forcing that player to tone
&gt; down his PC?
">

Not at all. First of all, only one of my players is competitive about
EXP. For the most part, they prefer that someone, anyone, reduce their
risks. If that happens, they are happy to see the character get the
points.

&lt;story&gt;Once a fairly large group of characters were eating in a tavern
in a big city. An odd NPC happened to know one of them from a previous
campaign. They fell into a conversation and the NPC, in his cups,
described Experience Points to them and how they are earned. They all
decided that they did not want any. They continued on the adventure
because they had other motivations.&lt;/&gt;

(Wouldn't work in a one-player dynamic, of course.)  Or

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is it purely a realism consideration?  Do you think the PC who cast
&gt; the Silence learned more than the PCs who took advantage of it?  (The
&gt; PC who cast the Silence then hung back and did little or nothing all
&gt; fight.)
">

If the spell blinded the enemy, I would consider that the amount the
other characters learned in the fight was a good deal reduced. The
spell-caster, even though he hung back the rest of the time, is the
only one who could get the credit for the points that were not given to
the others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't ever give differential EXP.  I have found this to be a source of
&gt; bad feelings, even in single-player games and much more in multi-player
&gt; games, and not much else.
">

If that had happened, I would have switched to equal EXP. This is
especially true since everyone seems to get a turn to be the big EXP
gainer, when it isn't equal anyway, and it all evens out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But my own preference (in contrast to my
&gt; player's) is not to give EXP at all but to give levels when it seems
&gt; appropriate.  The player won't accept this because it interferes with
&gt; use of AD&amp;D's magic-item-creation system and he is interested in the
&gt; resource-management aspects of that system.

&gt; I rather like being able to say to the GM, &quot;My PCs have finally taken
&gt; up the responsibility of being heroes, not just adventurers; I think
&gt; they should go up a level now.&quot;  (That was 9th level in SCAP.)  Or,
&gt; just as often, &quot;Nothing has really changed, and they haven't settled
&gt; into the current level yet, so don't.&quot;
">

This is a very good system. My first GM, John Leyland (before anyone
around here had SEEN AD&amp;D, using a mix of rules from several sources)
did this. I liked it a great deal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Might be a bone of contention in multi-player, though.  I haven't tried
&gt; it there.
">

It worked very well in John's multi-player campaign. Of course, he was
the first person to run games that any of us new and we didn't have
printed rules to tell us if he was doing wrong. But he was a graduate
student in mideaval studies at Yale, so we figured he had the setting
right and we were willing to play his rules. We didn't have EXP at all.
You just reached the next level of puissance when he and you agreed
that you had.

We haven't hit this in v3.5 yet, so I don't know if the book rules
are improved enough; if they aren't, I'll look for the errata.  This
spell has had more errata than anything else in the system!

The problem (a familiar one to computer programmers, I think) is
that Polymorph is an "import" spell.  It imports into the core rules any
mistake made by the authors of whatever monster manual or other monster
source you are using:  for example, if they rule that something is an
ability of a type emulatable by Polymorph when it should have been
something of a type not emulatable, you're suddenly confronted with
an ability that you thought was ruled out.

Someone told a story of a high level druid who found a way to Wild
Shape into a choker, and finally overcame the v3.5 restriction that
you can't cast two spells a round:  the author of the choker should
have given it Haste, but instead gave it an extra standard action, and
voila.

The reason that Summon Monster does not allow you to summon
monsters of your choice within some constraint, but instead gives an
explicit list, is to keep it from being "import"--there's a high
cost in flavor but perhaps it's worth it.

Things are certainly better if one avoids all of the splatbooks.
The warlock's magical damaging attack is given no type!  We had a long,
long discussion of this when we discovered it.  The damage has to be
some type or other so that we know what can defend against it, but
there is no hint in the class writeup.  And there are plenty of MM2,
MM3, Fiend Folio monsters which are a very bad idea to import.

Ah.  I think there are some dynamics in (most) multi-player games which
push toward sharing the spotlight and thus the EXP awards more evenly.
These are less apparent in single-player, and I don't think I'd expect
the awards to even out at all.

One of the besetting problems in single-player, multiple-character games
is the vicious circle caused by lack of spotlight time on a particular
PC.  The player has, say, six PCs in his head.  One of them is not very
effective for some reason, so the others are "in the spotlight" more
often.  They tend to develop stronger personalities and the player
tends to become more tactically proficient with their abilities.  This
makes it likely that the ineffective PC will be ignored even more,
and become even more ineffective; for example, the player may fail to
think of a tactic that would use that PC's strengths, because he's just
not thinking of that PC at all.

After a few months you have a couple of well-developed PCs and one or
more pieces of cardboard.

We know this is a problem, so if one PC is lagging we tend to push for
opportunities to give them stuff.  If I were going to give differential
EXP I'd tend to give it to the *least* effective PC, because maybe if
they go up a level and the others don't, they'll get more spotlight.
We don't do this, though:  we look for ways to give them NPC contacts,
items, abilities, followers, and adventure hooks particularly suited to
their abilities.  We also try to play out their actions, and abstract
actions of the most spotlighted PCs.  And we look for any opportunity to
see the disadvantaged PC on his own, away from the others, so he can have
the player's full attention.

We had a live example of this in SCAP.  The rogue, Tillie, was very
discouraging in the early scenarios because all of the lock target numbers
were much too hard for her.  (Apparently a design decision, as it's nearly
impossible for a rogue of her level to be much better than she was.)  She
was also fairly useless in combat:  not strong enough to be a melee fighter,
and without the feats and weapon choice to be a good missile specialist.
And everything we were up against seemed to be better at Hide and Move
Silently than she was.

Tillie had an intrinsically strong personality and didn't disappear
completely, but she ended up being a voice in party strategic arguments
and not much else.  By the time they were 5th level I had quit looking
for ways for Tillie to use her abilities, and she was (even though much
more capable now) not doing any more than she had at 2nd.  The party
then got its butt kicked due to inadequate advance information:  the GM
said, "Why didn't you scout?" and I replied immediately "We don't
have anyone who can."  And stopped and thought about it, and went out and
bought Tillie a bunch of support stuff, switched her to a different missile
weapon, and picked up an archery feat for her.  The GM kicked in a
powerful magic bow (taken off a dead enemy) and suddenly, rather than a
useless appendage in combat, Tillie was actually, in a fight that
suited her, frighteningly capable.  And she could scout, and started to
do so, leading to some nice ambushes.

I had thought my characterization of her was okay--she had strong
opinions already--but it got a lot better when she wasn't sitting around
useless during every tactical scene.

If the GM had given differential EXP based on contribution, Tillie would
be 1-2 levels lower than the other PCs, I think, and even the steps we
took would probably not have helped.  It would have been better to go the
other way, making her 1-2 levels *higher* than the other PCs.

EarthDawn handles differential XP reasonably well. Greatly simplified, the
cost of improving a skill rises in the following sequence - 100 200 300 500
800 1300 2100 3400 . . .

XP award for a scenario is based on the average level of the characters, and
follows a similar progression.

This means that an equal XP award is worth almost twice as much to a
character who is only one level lower than the average. This helps
lower-level characters catch up relatively quickly. Also, a party can be
given a noticeable boost by having a higher-level character tag along for a
while.

The system starts to break down at about ninth level because the XP awards
get out of sync with what the characters need to advance.  I think you
get stuck at ninth for over a year of weekly play, if you follow the rule
guidelines exactly. That's obviously a bit of a long wait. Also, characters
become able to buy low level skills up to a reasonable level (say, up to 2/3
of their level) with 'spare change' XPs. That's got both good points and bad
points to it, in my view. The D&amp;D progression is on the whole superior, I
think, because it seems to be smoother. But stealing some of the EarthDawn
advancement mechanic and importing it into D&amp;D does have something to be
said for it, for some games.

I think the creature Teleports.  If an archangel shows up
at the High Temple and says "I need a holy symbol, quick" surely
someone will find it one!  Anyway, the person who summoned it had
one....

That the spell summons a strong CR16 is already a bit disturbing.
In general being able to long-term summon something much more powerful
than yourself is hard on scenario balance.  The rules seem to imply
that this will be kept in control by the creature's desire to be paid
for its services, which works okay with evil creatures--but an angel
really ought not to say "I know the enemy of my god is about to
destroy the world, but you're not paying me enough so I won't help you."

For any rule in the rulebook someone will defend it.  I've read defenses
of the obvious typo in 1st edition that made ogre power so inordinately
cheap, for example.

The perception of clerics does differ wildly among groups.  My husband
is running SCAP for two different gaming groups (me, and a four-player
group with two adults and two teens).  The clerics are totally different
animals.  Mine is known for settling otherwise nasty fights abruptly with
show-stoppers:  either death touch (his domain ability), or spells like
Banishment, Dismissal, Silence, True Seeing, or occasionally Flame
Strike.  He never casts healing spells above CLW, and uses that mainly to
take prisoners.  Theirs is known for pumping hit points into the party fighter
during combat, and otherwise functions as a backup fighter.  The party
has adopted a combat strategy which requires the continual hp infusion,
so he almost never gets to cast anything else, and comes across as
essential but not powerful.  If the Planetar just follows you around
casting Cure Serious Wounds and swinging its sword, perhaps it's a CR16
after all.  That's not what happened in _Spider Queen_ though. :-)

Come to think of it, the cleric in _Spider Queen_ was like neither of
those, but a third type:  she cast a lot of buffing spells and consistently
out-fought the dedicated fighters, at least for a short time each day.
But this was a bit easier in v3.0 than it is in v3.5.

If the Planetar does *that*, it's damned impressive.

And actually, this is precisely the problem, not only with Polymorph,
but with the Planar Ally spells as well. You can pick any creature
within certain constraints of CR (which doesn't accomplish what the
designers were trying to do, because CR and character level don't
measure the same thing) and creature type (which *could* be a meaningful
restriction, but isn't in this case, because it confines you to
precisely the creature type most likely to get cool, abusable abilities

They may consider it a feature but I consider it a bug.  The type

it shouldn't be bypassed in this fashion.  "Force" damage was

awkward in the rules.  Why repeat that mistake again?  (We ruled

I can't quite regret that I allowed this class, because the PC is
excellent and couldn't be done with the core rules.  But I wish
I didn't have to allow it, because I really loathe the splatbooks,
especially _Arcane_.  The material is not well enough tested to
safely use, in my opinion.  It reintroduces a lot of problems which
were finally cast out of the core rules.

My solution was to declare that Polymorph type spells change your
SHAPE, and virtually nothing else. You get limited size based bonuses
or penalties to strength and dex, you may get natural armor, movement
modes or speed, natural weapons, and some senses, but all of those are
limited to typical values for the size of the final creature. Magical
gear changes form with you and if at all possible remains functional in
the new form.

Basically I have a list of the highest values in a bunch of stuff that
a polymorphed creature can have, and if you polymorph into something
that exceeds the listed values then tough luck, you get the listed
value and nothing more. (Natural armor bonuses are also limited to
caster level.)

Level 2 spells change your shape to anything else of the same size,
level 4 allows within one size category (and extends the resulting
range if neccessary to include small and medium), level 6 allows any
size. +2 to spell level changes the target from personal to touch.

Their problem is that they insist that having the shape of an orc makes
you stronger, that looking like a zombie gives you DR, and that looking
like a drow gives you SR. You're a caster, if you need to be able to do
X to act like your new shape then cast a spell that lets you do X. If
your druid wants to have a Bull's Strength when in the shape of a bull,
well, he gets +2 for size and there's a spell for additional strength
on his list, wonder what it's called....

Water-breathing?  Non-breathing (as for a zombie)?  Ability to live
on what the critter naturally eats?  Sonar?  Tremorsense?  Tunnelling?

I'd fuss over those edge cases a bit, but basically, this makes sense
to me.  To fully change into a powerful magical creature should take
a dedicated spell, so that it can be leveled properly.

I had one PC party which was fond of using Polymorph as an area-effect
weapon.  They would Polymorph something very big, like a whale, into
a mouse and keep it in a little bamboo cage.  Then they'd use Dispel
(nowadays I think you could just Dismiss) to turn it back inside a
tight space.  It's hard to argue that a blue whale appearing in a
10' square room will be anything less than catastrophe for the
occupants; if it's upstairs, it will probably destroy the whole
building.

I got very tired of this strategy after a while.  It's particularly
hard to rule against because you are *not* trying to Polymorph something
into a shape which doesn't fit in the available space (which the GM
might rule as a failure); instead, you are Dispelling an existing
spell, and it's not clear that Dispel should respect available space.
The main limit was availability of whales, though elephants and rhinos
produce a fairly dramatic effect too, and big monsters are of course
spectacular.

It's hard to write Polymorph so that the fun, colorful uses remain
and strategies like this one don't.

In my D&amp;D days, I would have overruled the whale trick on genre
grounds- i.e. you can't do anything with a spell that violates genre.
That may be a troublesome ruling for some playstyles, but it certainly
got us by.

Or I would have also taken great joy in the result of the players being
hit by an area dispell at a bad moment...

In AoH, the various shape-change spells are seriously limited as to
size and type to match the genre. They are rare in the first place,
typically only allow a single form or type of form, and of limited
duration. Almost none work on anything other than the caster.

Hey now! That was me, as it happens. I see it may well be a play

long as you don't have any compulsion to try and kill them with
unoptimised characters.

Plus, I got brassed off that those arguing it was too deadly were
adding +2 EL or more with encounter assumptions, making it the
equivilent of a CR 6. Begging the question and all that.

The Planetar? It's just plain bad monster design. If it wants 17th
level casting it's got to be CR 17+ and have the HD and stats to support
that. Plus, summons can't possibly be balanced using CR or HD.

Water-breathing yes, the aquatic subtype and the ability to breath air
are both specifically allowed. Tunnelling at up to 5'/round through
soft earth yes, again specifically allowed in the house-rules. All
others no, they aren't listed as things that CAN be added/changed and
the list in my houserules of what can be given by the new shape is
comprehensive. If I didn't SAY in the full houserules that something
can be granted by the new form then the new form doesn't grant it.

Had it occured to me I'd have allowed that how much you need to eat is
influenced by your new size. (Or maybe not... That might be a dandy way
to prevent the polymorph to small size abuse Brian mentioned, I'd
rather not have to appeal to genre or to a strict reading of the rules
on occupying impossible spaces to stop that. Note that with my rules
the abuse requires a level 8 spell so it isn't all that big a problem
since CR15+ foes are likely to be able to ignore a whale occupying
their space.)

But polymorph to a Zombie and you still need to eat and breath since
your type hasn't changed and you're still alive. Hence the reason for
the zombie's abilities/immunites doesn't apply to you.

Sonar and Tremorsense no, you're ability to interperet vibrations is
still limited to what it was in your natural form. You also don't get
blindsense/blindsight/blindfight type abilities. Darkvision and
Lowlight vision yes though, you get the new form's eyes.

Someguy was maintaining they could actually kill it without serious
risk and posted far more to the thread than you did. You simply claimed
it was easily avoidable and that avoiding it could count as a win. The
thing works fine as a "you have to avoid this" style encounter at level
4, but IMAO that makes it higher than CR4. "I defeat" and "I run away"
aren't always synonymous and when they are that's a negative EL
adjustment IMAO.

I note that I was one of the few people agreeing with you that evading
an encounter still gave XP. But in general that XP is likely to be
ad-hocced down (whether or not they kill it if the fight is avoidable
IMC), and the PCs should be able to KILL a monster of equal CR if for
instance once every year or so it sneaks out of it's bog and kills a
herdsman or two so the village needs it to be killed. And they should
be able to kill it in its natural habitat. Fat chance with the Hydra.

HD are hopeless. They simply don't correspond to actual power in any

Unfortunately in a series of linked modules, doing so will end you
up so severely lacking in treasure that you'll die.  I hate to
encourage money-grubbing, but if the thing is run "by the book" you
really have grub (and even then there is not enough).

Both the current _Worms_ PCs and the SCAP PCs like to spend money on
other things than equipment, too, which is important for roleplaying but
makes the treasure even more essential.

The SCAP PCs tried to make their near-TPK scenario easier by
bribing a significant baddie not to be there--and it helped, though
not enough.  We have no qualms about doing things like this.

But "one room at a time" wasn't meant to mean "we only hit the bits
we need to hit."  It was meant to mean "We hit a room and retreat for
a day, then come back and do it again."  The NPCs really have to
respond if you do very many iterations of that, unless they are
mindless undead or bound demons or something.  And of course events
in the world have to advance too.  It takes *forever* to do a big

What size party are you used to?  This is less true the larger the
party is, in my experience.  With 4 PCs you definitely use everyone in

back out of the others' way, doing support casting or missile fire
or just guarding the back.  Otherwise it is very easy to get tangled
up.  And frequently you *can't* reasonably bring 8 characters to

Gods, yes.  I hate this.

We were talking through the personalities that the SCAP party ended
up with--even the paladin is not, in a classical sense, a very good
person--and finally asked the party leader flat-out why the PCs behave
as they do.

"Because, without exception, the only people we have ever seen being
effective were evil.  Being good mostly seems to make you passive
and helpless.  In a few exceptional cases good people have tried
to do something, but they always died immediately--like the High
Priest of Cuthburt--or were immediately turned bad."

And then (if the questioner is someone he's willing to trust):  "And
no one has ever shown the least bit of interest in the discoveries
I've made or the great twist of fate I'm involved in, except people
who are, by any conventional standard, evil.  Being good seems to
mean being numb, indifferent to the world and its glories and terrors."

Even Charis sees this.  Paladins who fall from grace traditionally
end up chaotic evil, but I think this one could end up lawful evil.

"Can't handle" in the sense of "the encounter is no longer challenging",
or "can't handle" in the sense of "the plot is broken"?  I can live with
a certain amount of the former.  There are *so many* fights in one of
these paths that it really doesn't matter if some of them are easy, or
even if a whole bunch are easy.  But if the later events all collapse
due to early PC actions, that's a pain.

The SCAP PCs just tricked a fairly important foe into letting herself
be Dominated. If the GM hadn't already been committed to going off
the path, this would have forced him to do so:  I don't see any way
things could go as originally plotted, given that.  But gosh, it was
a satisfactory conclusion.  (Catching her with the spell would have
been nice, but it's all luck--she makes the save on a 5.  Persuading
her to throw the save, *that* was a coup.)

I don't think the effect is necessarily non-serious; my big
problem is when the PCs are the first people ever to think of
this stuff, which is almost invariably the case in published
settings, and hard to avoid even in your own if the spell
system is at all complex.

If castles can be taken out by a fairly low level spell, either
there should be no castles, or defenses should have been developed,
or people who can do that spell should be under some form of
societal control.  Any of those are fine, but the GM needs to
know about them!

The exact same concept has been used in other systems, like HERO. There
they even published Planet Man as an example of rule abuse (he'd shrink
planets and carry them in his pocket, taking them out and tossing them
and revoking the shrinking just before impact).

There are basically two approaches to that sort of thing.

The original HERO approach was to laugh at it and leave it up to the GM
to control in his games. HERO was viewed as a toolset open to as wide
of an array of concepts and uses possible- thus any use had to be
judged individually as to it suitability to a specific campaign. This
concept applied not only in construction- but in use during a game
session as an outgrowth of special effects.

The current approach in 5th edition has in large measure turned its
back upon that original concept and has attempted to remove such abuses
mechanically. The result has been vast growth in rule word count, lost
of system flexiability, and the use of 'cute builds' for what were
previously easily managed concepts that didn't need to take up space on
the character sheets.

Personally I'm a big fan of the older method and think it should be
applied to every rpg bought off the shelves. Those are intended for a
wider market than any individual buyer and thus cover styles and
methods not suitable for that individual. IMO, one of the 'must do'
items before starting a campaign is to go through the rules and remove
those things which don't fit the group's needs.

Of course no one is perfect, and things will be missed. In my case,
will remove things on the fly in the middle of the game. I find this,
while a bad option itself, to cause less damage than allowing it entry
into the world history.

Hm.  Probably they should have explicitly defined a generic magic damage

Lack of continuity between the people who wrote the core rules and the ones

It's kind of surprising how being utterly, hopelessly doomed can make

That was certainly our conclusion when we saw it in action in
v3.0 (City of the Spider Queen).  The PCs summoned two of them
and they were considerably more powerful than the PC cleric.  Much
of a PC's equipment is meant to cover vulnerabilities which the
angels cover in other ways (SR, DR, immunities).  They thrashed
balors with ease.  The player (who is usually more tolerant of
one-spell-solutions than I am) recommended that we not allow this
in the future.

You found paladins to have superpowers?  I'm continually frustrated
with the class.  SCAP (very appropriately, I think) has paladins as
very rare and individually significant people, and I really like that
flavor.  But in play they just aren't, unless you load them up with
special-purpose equipment.

Arcanus Unearthed has the exact same problem with the Champion class.
They are dedicated champions of a person, place, organization or
ideal, and they should be *impressive* as such.  But they are so
darned weak, you just feel sorry for them:  they would have been
much better off as warmains (the heavy fighter equivalent).

I doubt Charis will ever lose her sense of obligation, but I could
see her giving up on her principles and deciding that the ends
justify the means, and I think that would make her, in this case,
closer to lawful evil than lawful good.  She has never been very
solidly good anyway; she's a Law-paladin rather than a Good-paladin.

At the moment Fritz is saying to her, "I think this prisoner can
be redeemed.  I know she's too dangerous to turn loose and too
difficult to keep, but I have a Plan for dealing with that."  It
is hard for Charis to say "No, I don't care if she can be redeemed--
kill her."  But if she agrees to Fritz' plan, well, it's blackest
necromancy to start with, and the odds are quite good that rather
than redeeming the NPC, it will corrupt Fritz.  Fritz is the big
chink in Charis' personal ethics anyway; he's not a nice person at
all, but he's her older brother and she doesn't want to lose him,
no matter how badly she needs to.

I have been surprised at how hard it's been for Charis to maintain
her personal standards in this setting.  Much harder than for any
paladin I'd played before, even though nothing has tried to corrupt
her directly at all.  (At least, I don't think so.)

Same here. Most game systems have them to be wimpy fighters with rather
wimpy spells that do little to improve them. The current D&amp;D version is
nothing worth bragging about (although I'll be forced to say that I only
gave them a once over).

In online MMORPGs they are typically even worse off.

Very few games treat them properly.

I've been trying to figure out what would be a suitable improvement.

We found Charis extremely unsatisfactory after about 8th level; she
doesn't even get new powers anymore (just things like increasing her
Cure Disease from 2x/week to 3x/week) and the spells do not help.
A fighter with a few potion bottles in his pocket is as good or
better than Charis at doing what her spells do.

My mental image of what she should be doing involves being able to
walk onto a battlefield and make things go better for her side, not
by direct force of arms, but by strengthening and rallying her
allies.  The fear-resistance power works for this except that the
10' range makes it next to impossible to use:  in a lengthy campaign
a PC who needed to make a fear save has been within 10' of Charis
exactly *once*.  A very few spells, mainly Bless, work for it.
Nothing else does.

I think she should be able to smash through the enemy's illusions
and fear-effects and charms.  The old Holy Avenger rules did that,
I guess, but she should not be dependent on a magic item in
order to be a paladin.  If this is going to be represented by
spells, it should be substantive spells:  Break Enchantment,
Magic Circle Versus Evil, that sort of thing.  The whole idea that
you can beef up an 11th level character by giving her another 2nd
level spell just doesn't work.

Jon thinks that explicit magical powers or feats would be a better
match to the conception than any spells at all.  One complaint about
Charis is that with her very small number of spells per day (2
first, 2 second at 10th level) she invariably seems to have the wrong
spell, which doesn't feel paladinic.  We'll go months without
seeing a devil, and suddenly run into a group of them:  Bless Weapon
would actually help, but for months there has been no reason to carry
it.  Mages and priests get enough spells that carrying a few "on spec"
is okay, but paladins don't.  And it just seems wrong that a holy
warrior has to say "Sorry, can't help you:  wasn't expecting these
devils."  (Without Bless Weapon she is truly ineffectual against
devils, far and away the worst character in the party.)

IIRC, one of the reasons it's supposed to be "okay" to have such powerful
summoned creatures is that a summoned creature can be sent away with
spells like dismissal and dispel magic, may be unable to attack opponents
using protection from good and unholy aura (1), and so on. For example,
Balors have greater dispel magic and unholy aura at will, CL 20 - if the
angels were summoned (and not called), the balor could have tried
dispelling the summoning spell.

Cheers,

Gary Johnson

(1) If reasonably sure unholy aura has a "send good-aligned outsiders
away" effect - sorry, can't access the SRD to check.
