...called "imperialism." To no one's surprise : With Israel intensifying its air and artillery attacks on Lebanon and warning of a protracted war, the Senate yesterday unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution endorsing Israel's military campaign and condemning Hezbollah and its two backers, Iran and Syria. A few hours earlier, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) delivered his most strident defense of Israel since the conflict erupted a week ago. The House is expected to pass a similarly pro-Israel resolution today. The Senate resolution is here . The House resolution (there are a couple, but I think this is the right one), is even worse , in that it includes this astonishing assertion in its "resolved" sections which is absent from the Senate version: Resolved, That the House of Representatives--(4) recognizes Israel's longstanding commitment to minimizing civilian loss and welcomes Israel's continued efforts to prevent civilian casualties; Amazingly enough, there are people, even after the last week of bombing in Lebanon (now up to 300 dead, with the percentage of civilians still more than 90%), who will defend this preposterous assertion. Of course there are people who think that U.S. foreign policy has nothing but benevolent impulses driving it, too.

Stay the course, just six more months - Thomas Friedman

Wish I knew when Friedman first said this. If we only stuck to 6 months the first time he said it, we'd be out of these quagmires years ago.

I'm not a fan of Pat Buchanan, but I have to give him credit. He is the only talking head I've heard in the past few days who is condemning Israel for the carnage it has created. A few on the left are also appalled, but damn few. AIPAC's influence has shut down rational discourse.

I admit I was surprised when Russ Feingold talked about Israel's right to defend itself. I had forgotten that when Israel is the issue, the entire US congress's eyes glaze over. I know it's about AIPAC and the lobby, but it still feels like an existential mystery to me, how rational public officials, many of them attorneys and former prosecutors, suddenly go into a trance and genuflect toward the east.

Genuflect? I think you've got the wrong religion.

I take back all the nice things I've said about Tom Harkin. He was a co-sponsor of the resolution. Looks like members of Congress practically fell all over themselves in their haste to line up and endorse Israel's barbaric acts. What a world.

What is it about Israel that makes rational discourse and common sense morality among most Americans (and virtually all U.S. politicians) impossible? They didn't have this problem condemning the apartheid regime of South Africa. Why is Israel so untouchable?

These craven apologists for Israel's crimes sicken me. I had some respect for Feingold but fuck him, Reid, Hillary and all the rest of the amoral bought and paid for war shills.
