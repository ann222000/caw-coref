I attended a meeting with about 5 members of the Social Justice Sub-
Committee of the UU Accotink (in Burke) Congregation last night to
explain our mission and invite their reaction/comments/support.  They
listened politely and were attentive, but did not show much enthusiasm
for having their congregation participate in any partisan political
agenda.

I assured them our group represented nonpartisan viewpoints -- with
neither the Dems nor Repubs being very supportive so far -- and
suggested that if we-the-people are serious about moving our country
toward peace, then we must no-longer tolerate war-mongers in public
office.  They agreed, but remained reluctant to promote our program to
their fellow congregants at this time.  Instead, they are willing to
consider placing a few words into their newsletter to notify, and
perhaps solicit interest among, individual members of their church.  I
believe this to be a reasonable approach, and so I will draft and
submit a few words for their consideration.

FWIW, they seemed much more ammenable to dealing with matters which
more clearly supported the cause of peace and accountability -- rather
than impeachment.  This is not the first time I've received such a
reaction.  I suspect others might have similar experiences.  I think
we might want to reconsider the name of our group.  I propose that we
consider that we might more accurately be characterized as "Patriots
for Peace and Accountability" who have taken up the project to advance
the cause withing the 11th CD for Congressional investigations of
alleged impeachable and/or criminal acts of the Bush regime.

Greg, personally I'd rather we keep impeachment in the name because
there are so many "peace" groups and "progressive" groups out there
who are doing nothing whatsoever to forward our cause to get rid of
these monsters.  We already have peace people we are working with in
the Prince William Peacemakers, and we already have political folks we
are working with with the PDA stuff, but what we know that they have
forgotten is that the only way Nixon was forced to resign was to
threaten him with impeachment.  We've done some good work so far and I
think we are making a difference.  I'm sorry the UUs are so wishywashy
but maybe we can't necessarily count on group support, especially from
churches, who are traditionally resistant.  Maybe we should
concentrate on some in the "Democratic" wing of the Democratic party -
angry Dean Democrats and Kucinich Democrats and Nader
malcontents :) .  We'll have to ferret out more mavericks like
ourselves to grow.  Anybody know any Green party people?  Even
Libertarians might be interested in our cause.  Also, we haven't
tapped the resources of the Fairfax County Democratic party at all.
So we might not get group support but maybe we can make ourselves
known to the groups and recruit through them anyway.

At any rate, I'm interested to see how this phone call will go
tonight.  Maybe Democrats.com can come up with a strategy or a media
campaign or something to forward our cause.

Disappointing to hear about their lukewarm reception, but not surprising, I
suppose.  If they support "accountability", how else do they suppose Bush et
al. can be held accountable?

"VA11 Patriots for Peace and Accountability" is just fine, although I think
the term "patriots", having been used historically by so many villains, has
become nearly meaningless.

Nancy, I certainly agree that we should pay close attention to those
within the Democratic Party who are natural allies to this cause.  But
I also think we can benefit tremendously from cultivating support
amongst natural allies in the peace movement and churches who are fed
up with carrying signs and being ignored.  Aren't most of those who
are active with us really peaceniks who have become completely
frustrated with Bush/Cheney's intransigence?  I think so.  I see no
benefit from diminishing the role of peaceniks, liberal churches, or
non-Democrats in this cause.

Further, recall our first meeting where we decided to call for
investigations since the word impeachment was too put-offish to many.
We rightly sensed we'd have better luck with honey than a hot poker.
I think this is the same reason it is easier for natural (but perhaps
timid) non-partisan allies to find the term accountability more
appealing.

Below are the "words" I shared with the secretary of the UU Accotink
Social Justice Committee after meeting on Tuesday.  Don't know whether/
how/when they will be shared with members of the UU Accotink
congregation.

Also, I intend to share something similar with the Northern Virginians
for Peace and Justice group tonight, and PDA (Falls Church) on
Saturday.

----------------------------------------------

In recent months we've all experienced an explosion of frustration
among fellow advocates for peace, justice and the serious practice of
democracy right here in the U.S.  This explosion follows the continued
disregard of the viewpoints of the vast majority of American citizens
by Bush/Cheney.

Increasingly, more and more of us have come to the realization that
Bush/Cheney are not only insensitive to our concerns, but they are
utterly disinterested in anything that calls into question the
president's unilateral stay-the-course policies on secrecy,
privatization, and aggressive global conflict.  It is becoming harder
and harder to deny that if We-the-People are serious about moving our
country away from the course of Bush/Cheney, then we must no longer
tolerate such elected officials as those who cannot get beyond their
limited capacities to put the interests of the nation above the
special interests of an elite minority.

As such, several non-partisan Northern Virginians living in the 11th
Congressional District (and others), have begun to meet as "Virginia
Patriots for Peace and Accountability."   These fellow citizens have
taken up the cause to seek out constitutional remedies for the current
national crisis of mis-leadership, and to speak out in support of
Congressional investigations into alleged impeachable and/or criminal
acts by Bush/Cheney.

Further, Virginia Patriots for Peace and Accountability invites fellow
Virginians to participate in any of a variety of activities currently
underway to include:  (1) weekly Peace and Accountability
demonstrations; (2) writing letters to Davis, Webb, Warner and others
requesting their support for and initiation of Congressional
investigations; (3) citizen hearings/teach-ins/panel discussions
promoting the need for Congressional investigations; (4) acquiring
signatures on petitions in support of Congressional investigations;
and (5) making statements on camera in support of Congressional
investigations  (sample can be viewed here
