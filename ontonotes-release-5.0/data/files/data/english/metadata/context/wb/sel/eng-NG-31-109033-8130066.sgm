How did anti-tank rifles disable tanks? They were mostly firing slugs right
(by which I mean non explosive rounds)?

Were users of anti-tank rifles supposed to shoot out the engines of tanks?
It seems unlikely to me that a rifle round would
be lucky enough to ever directly hit a crewmember. Did they rely on
spalling?

The basic idea of an anti-tank rifle was a one-man weapon
capable of penetrating armour.  Whatever penetrated the
armour was likely to do significant damage inside,
perhaps enough to prevent the tank carrying out its mission.

The round will still have a fair bit of energy once it penetrates, but not
enough to punch its way out the other side, so it is going to bounce around
inside a bit. As there is not a lot of wasted space inside a tank, there is
a fair chance that it will hit something important even on first
penetration. There were several special rounds made to try to overcome their
decreasing effectiveness as armour got thicker. The most effective had
hardened penetrators that would carry on through the armour, making a
smaller hole, while the main body was stopped by the armour. The Germans
developed that concept further by making the main round a tear gas
container, with the idea that, even if the round did not disable the tank,
the gas would force the crew out, although they had a tendency to fall off
and release the gas outside the tank.

Well, the German AT rifle actually fired a round that had a tiny
amount of tear gas in it!

They were trained to aim for vulnerable locations on tanks; engine
grills, vision ports, hatches, etc.

Anything that makes it through a tank's armor is likely to bounce
around and hit something vital, whether that is a critical piece of
equipment or a crewmember.

well,the Nazi did have one useless one with a teargas ampule, but yes,
a solid KE penetrator

yes, those and the bullet would start bouncing around inside the tank,
hopefully hitting something important like fuel or hydraulic line,
or a crewmember.

Another was to damage the periscopes and such. What a Tanker can't
see, cant hurt.
if you can goto youtube.com and search for    boys rifle
and a WWII training film on the main UK and US Marine ATR you can
watch, will show.

Anti Tank Rifles were generally fired a high calibre, high velocity bullet
which had enough energy to penetrate armour. A bullet striking armour with
enough energy to pierce armour converts a lot of it to heat, so when the
armour is penetrated there is a lot of hot metal flying around inside the
confined spaces of the tank, which can kill or wound crew members and
possible set off a fire.

Most of the tanks in the early stages of the war were vulnerable to anti
tank rifles, but as tank design progressed they used thicker armour against
which the rifles had little effect. They eventually abandoned ant tank
rifles and switched to weapons with shaped charges.

Thanks again Mike.

Interesting video. The boys rifle looks like it would only have been
effective against Japanese tanks and Itai tanks, maybe the Pzkfp III could
be engaged at short range.

Was it basically completely replaced by the PIAT? Or did some British units
still carry the boys rifle?

In the West, pretty much, but Soviets kept their better performing
14.5mm PTRD until well after WWII, and was effective against
the side armor on Nazi tanks, including the Panther

Fairly marginal against the Panther though. Only the vertical 40 mm side
lower hull armor could be penetrated at very short range (less than 100
meters). However, the 14.5 mm ATRs proved to be a big nuisance for heavy
tanks as well, since the gunners were trained to target commander's
cupolas, optics and vision slits.

The last tank kills for the PTRD were recorded in Korea where several
M24 Chaffees were permanently disabled by ATR fire. They even managed to
penetrate some M4s, but apparently none were permanently destroyed. The
US M26 and M46 tankers did not seem to have much trouble with them
though, most likely since the North Korean and Chinese gunners were not
trained to aim at optics and other vulnerable spots.

I would have thought that ATRs would remain
effective against light-armored vehicles,
such as halftracks, armored cars, and
light tanks.

There were plenty of these around. AT rockets
and guns would do for them of course, but the
ATR would have advantages of weight (vs a gun),
range (vs rockets), and could still be worth
having around.

Was this at all a factor, or was it too much
trouble to lug an ATR around for this marginal
purpose?

True enough, but then you run into other problems. You have to train your
troops with another type of weapon, possibly modify tactics. The newer AT
weapons were more versatile, being effective against both the light and
heavy armoured vehicles.  You would have to have crews to man the extra
weapons, taking away from the other weapons teams in a platoon. You have to
keep the troops supplied with yet another type of ammunition.  It seems to
make sense to just stick to the one weapon.

That is about what it amounts to.
