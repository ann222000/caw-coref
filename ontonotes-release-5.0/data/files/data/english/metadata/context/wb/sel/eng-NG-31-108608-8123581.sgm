Einstein himself says that speed of light is variable:
it depends on the intensity of the gravity field.

http://www.speed-light.info/speed_of_light_12000.htm#_variable_speed_...
&lt;CITE&gt;
Recalling the very famous second postulate of Special Relativity declared
by Einstein (1905): &quot;The velocity c of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial
frames of reference in all directions and depend neither on the velocity
of the source nor on the velocity of the observer&quot;.

Einstein's theory of special relativity says that the speed of light in
vacuum is always the same (at 299,792.458 km/s) but this is true only
for systems that are inertial, which means not accelerating.

From Newton's second law: if forces exist  implies acceleration exists;
this means that special relativity is valid only when no forces are acting;
thus it cannot be used when there is a gravitational force present.
Albert Einstein himself emphasized this in his paper written in 1917:
&quot;The results of the special relativity hold only so long as we are able
to disregard the influence of gravitational fields on the phenomena&quot;.
Therefore for the results of special relativity to hold the systems should
not be accelerating (no gravitational forces).

In 1915 (10 years after special relativity) Einstein developed another
theory called General Relativity that deals with gravitational fields and
according to this latest theory the velocity of light appears to vary with
the intensity of the gravitational field. For example, an observer outside
gravitational fields measures the speed of light locally (in his location)
at 299792.458 km/s but when he looks towards a black hole he sees
the speed of light there to be as slow as a few meters/sec.

At the same time an observer freefalling into that black hole (zero-g)
measures the speed of light locally (in his location) at 299792.458 km/s;
when he looks towards the black hole he sees the speed of light there
much slower; when he looks away from the black hole he sees the
speed of light there much faster. If he tries to resist his freefall into
that black hole (by firing his rockets for example) he will not measure
the speed of light locally anymore at 299792.458 km/s; instead
the stronger the g-force that he feels the faster light appears to him.
Again when he looks towards the black hole he sees the speed of light
there much slower; when he looks away from the black hole he sees
the speed of light there much faster. In any case, freefalling or not,
he will never see the speed of light outside gravitational fields at 299792.458 km/s.
Finally, there is no difference between the effects of g-forces
experienced from these rockets and the effects of g-forces experienced
when standing on planets, stars... hence an observer standing
on a black hole measures the speed of light locally (in his location)
much faster than 299792.458 km/s; when he looks towards
outside gravitational fields he sees the speed of light there a zillion km/s.

To see the steps how Einstein theorized that the speed of light in a
gravitational field is actually not a constant, but rather a variable
depending upon the reference frame of the observer:
'On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light',
Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. Einstein wrote this paper in 1911 in German
( http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1911_35_898-... ).
It predated the full formal development of general relativity by about four years.
You can find an English translation of this paper in the Dover book
'The Principle of Relativity' beginning on page 99; you will find in
section 3 of that paper Einstein's derivation of the variable speed of light
in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is:
c' = c * (1 + phi / c^2)
Where phi is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
the speed of light c is measured. Simply put:
Light appears to travel slower  in stronger gravitational fields (near bigger mass).
[...]
In conclusion, the velocity of light in a gravitational field is not a constant,
but rather a variable depending upon the reference frame of the observer;
what one observer sees as true another observer sees as false.
The only observers that can actually agree that the speed of light
outside gravitational fields is 299792.458 km/s are those who are
themselves outside gravitational fields.
&lt;/CITE&gt;

For me this interpretation of the speed of the light makes very much sense.
In gravity fields, ie. in accellerated frames, light and time slows down,
oscillators oscillate slower, organisms age slower, much like the experienced
time dilation on earth compared to outer space. The stronger the intensity
of the gravity field the more these effects are. The original state, ie. the highest value,
is where g=0, ie. in free space.
For us on earth time goes slower, so is also the speed of ligh; it is slower
than in free space. Also the bending (shifting) of rays of star lights by the sun
is explained by this simple fact, ie. gravity causes everything to slow down.

BTW, this is the first time I agree with Einstein!  :-)))

Nonsense, he said nothing of the kind in 1905.
What he said was:
&quot;light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which
is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body&quot;, and nothing at
all about &quot;inertial frames of reference&quot;, you are making it up.

Yes.

Wrong.  Your logic is erroneous eg forces can still be exerted in inertial
frames even though overall they are subject to no external forces.

Rest of misconceptions mercifully snipped.

[Beware: Pentcho Valev obsesses about that equation, and
posts endless articles about it around here, ALL WRONG.]

That 1911 article was documenting a portion of Einstein's arduous trek
from SR to GR. The above formula does not hold in GR, except in certain
approximations for specific physical situations; it is not a general
formula at all. In GR, the speed of light (in vacuum) is c in EVERY
locally inertial frame (when measured with standard clocks and rulers).
But due to the curvature of spacetime, when measured over a non-local
distance one can obtain other values. The above formula purports to
describe the speed of light &quot;there&quot; when measured by an observer &quot;here&quot;
-- in GR that in general makes no sense; in the small-field
APPROXIMATION to GR it does make sense, and that formula holds
APPROXIMATELY for certain specific measurements (even in the small-field
approximation it is not a general formula).

So yes, there are cases where the speed of light is not c (in vacuum).
But it is considerably more subtle than you seem to think.

&gt; &gt; equivalent formula proved experimentally by Pound and Rebka and
&gt; &gt; showing how the frequency varies with the gravitational potential:

&gt; &gt; f' = f * (1 + phi / c^2)

&gt; &gt; I say the two formulas are &quot;equivalent&quot; because they are related by
&gt; &gt; the textbook equation

&gt; &gt; frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength)

&gt; &gt; So Roberts Roberts the danger is not over: unless you offer more clear
&gt; &gt; and unambiguous explanations, even your zombies will find that the two
&gt; &gt; formulas are JUST TRUE, confirmed by experiment, and will also find,
&gt; &gt; by applying Einstein's equivalence principle, that

&gt; &gt; c' = c * (1 + phi / c^2)

&gt; &gt; is equivalent to

&gt; &gt; c' = c + v

&gt; &gt; where c is the initial speed of photons relative to the light source
&gt; &gt; and v is the relative speed of the light source and the observer, in
&gt; &gt; the absence of a gravitational field.

&gt; Really? Explain how phi = 0 equates to c' = c+v.

&gt; Then once your finished explaining that, explain why anyone should
&gt; care about Einstein's defunct attempt at gravitation.

&gt; http://bip.cnrs-mrs.fr/bip10/valevfaq.htm

Gisse Gisse your statement:

&quot;Explain how phi = 0 equates to c' = c+v&quot;

is EXTREMELY silly. Never do so again! One more statement of this kind
and you will never become Master Tom Roberts' PhD student. Master Tom
Roberts loves silly zombies but not SO silly.

Consider:

http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~phys16/Textbook/ch13.pdf pp.2-4

Note that

phi = gh = cv.

Substitute this in Einstein's 1911 equation

c' = c * (1 + phi / c^2)

and you obtain

c'=c+v.

Yes, all hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult know the correct
formula. You can also infer it by combining two correct equations:

(1) frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength)

(2) f' = f * (1 + phi / c^2) (Pound-Rebka; f is frequency)

There is not a single formula, there is only a procedure: A measurement
of the speed of light necessarily has two synchronized clocks, a light
source at one clock, a light detector at the other clock, and a ruler
laid along the light path. To compute/predict the outcome, one specifies
how the clocks are synchronized, and also the particular null geodesic
followed by the light from source to detector; one integrates the metric
over the paths of the two clocks from their synchronization to their
respective emission and detection events, and then takes the ratio of
the ruler distance to the time difference.

Why isn't there a formula? Because the speed of light
over a non-local path is not a fundamental aspect of the
theory. It is possible to prove that in the limit of
zero distance with Einstein synchronization this
procedure yields the value c, in agreement with SR; this
is independent of location, gravitation, or anything else.

If the light path is so large (compared to the curvature of the
manifold) that no single coordinate system can cover the entire
measurement, the whole notion of &quot;speed&quot; is meaningless.

This is not a &quot;flaw&quot;, it is a _strength_: GR has no need to make such a
differentiation. As discussed above, one integrates over the actual
paths of the clocks, uses their synchronization as starting times, and
uses the actual light path as stopping times. This works no matter how
the clocks move, and no matter what the light path is. There is
inherently no need to describe the motion as either translational or
rotational, one merely describes the actual paths.

Roberts Roberts if you continue teaching idiocies of this kind, even
the silliest zombies in Einstein criminal cult will stop believing
you. Whoever told you that a physical quantity can only be measured
DIRECTLY? Even undegraduates would tell you Roberts Roberts that the
speed of light could be measured INDIRECTLY, e.g. by measuring the
gravitational redshift factor:

http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation of a
long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space came in
1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory -- that the
speed of light is reduced when it passes through a gravitational
field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the second
place our result shows that, according to the general theory of
relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the
special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently
referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of
light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light
varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the Special
Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so called
mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even suggest that
the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is somewhat
surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On the
Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of light
in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation for
the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of gravity.
One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is c'=c(1+V/c^2)
where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To compute/predict the outcome, one specifies

&gt; Since 1972 the speed of light is DEFINED at
&gt; 299.792.458+-0.001, NOT measured. No effort
&gt; to measure the speed will be made since then.

Actually 1983 was when it was established as a constant, rather
than derived from a manmade length standard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Moreover, the meter and second are both
&gt; defined based on the speed of light,

No, the second is not defined by the &quot;speed of light&quot;, but by a
stochastic process where light is emitted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so no change in the speed of light can be
&gt; measured anymore!

True.
