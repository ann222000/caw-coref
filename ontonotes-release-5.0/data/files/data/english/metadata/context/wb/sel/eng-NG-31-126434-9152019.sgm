The children were lined up in the cafeteria of
a Religious School for lunch. At the head of the
table was a large pile of apples. The
nun had made a note,

&quot;Take only one, God is watching,&quot;

Moving through the line, to the other end of the
table, was a large pile of chocolate chip
cookies. One of the boys had written a note,

&quot;Take all you want,
God is watching the apples.&quot;

God Bless You Alison

Ali, I love you. I miss you today.
You touched us and changed us,
But you couldn't stay.

Your Pain took you places where we couldn't go.
Your Pain left you breathless. Your Pain never let go.

A tortured Angel you were, such a bumpy rough ride.
So loving you were. Now you‚re gone and I find
That I miss you much more than my heart can abide
You‚re an Angel in Heaven. You've left us all behind.

You‚re a star in the night sky,
A ray of light in the sun.
You‚re the laughter of children.
A sweet song being sung.

Ali, I love you. I miss you today.
You touched me and changed me.
But you just couldn't stay.

God has rescued you, Ali,
And your Pain's taken away.

Just For Today
October 25                             Principles before personalities

&quot;Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever
reminding us to place principles before personalities.&quot;
Twelfth Tradition

&quot;Principles before personalities.&quot; Many of us chant these words
along with the reader whenever the Twelve Traditions are read.
The fact that these words have become a cliche of sorts doesn't
make them any less important, either in service or in our lives.
These words are an affirmation: &quot;We listen to our conscience and
do what's right, no matter who's involved:' And that principle serves
as one of the cornerstones of recovery as well as our traditions.

What does &quot;principles before personalities&quot; really mean? It means
we practice honesty, humility, compassion, tolerance, and patience
with everyone, whether we like them or not. Putting principles
before personalities teaches us to treat everyone equally. The
Twelfth Step asks us to apply principles in all our affairs; the
Twelfth Tradition suggests we apply them to our relations with
everyone.

Practicing principles doesn't stop with our friends or when we leave
a meeting. It's for every day, for everyone... in all areas of our
lives.

Just for today: I will listen to my conscience and do what's right. My
focus will be on principles, not on people's personalities.

Love Without Strings

Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure
immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89

Sponsorship held two surprises for me.  First, that my sponsees
cared about me. What I had thought was gratitude was more like
love.  They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober.
Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once.
Second, I  discovered that I was able to love someone else
responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person's
growth.  Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care
sincerely about another's well-being had atrophied from lack of
use.  To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been
one of the deepest gifts the program has given me. Gratitude for
that gift has kept me sober many times.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden / October 25th

A.A. Thought for the Day

Fifth, I have learned to live one day at a time. I have finally
realized the great fact that all I have is now. This sweeps
away all vain regret and it makes my thoughts of the future
free of fear. Now is mine. I can do what I want with it. I own
it, for better or worse. What I do now, in this present moment,
is what makes up my life. My whole life is only a succession of
nows. I will take this moment, which has been given to me by
the grace of God, and I will do something with it. What I do
with each now will make me or break me. Am I living in the now?

Meditation for the Day

We should work at overcoming ourselves, our selfish desires
and our self-centeredness. This can never be fully accomplished.
We can never become entirely unselfish. But we can come to
realize that we are not at the center of the universe and that
everything does not revolve around us at the center. I am only
one cell in a vast network of human cells. I can at least make
the effort to conquer the self-life and seek daily to obtain more
and more of this self-conquest. &quot;He that overcomes himself is
greater than he who conquers a city.&quot;

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may strive to overcome my selfishness. I pray that
I may achieve the right perspective of my position in the world.

Today's Thought
OCTOBER 25

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

Letting Go of the Past

... in thy book were written, every one of them, the days that
were formed for me when as yet there was none of them.
--Ps. 139:16

Some people believe that each of our days were planned,
Divinely Ordered, before we were born. God knew, they say, and
planned exactly what was to transpire.

Others suggest we chose, we participated in planning our life - the
events, the people, the circumstances that were to take place, in
order to work through our issues and learn the lessons we needed
to master.

Whatever our philosophy, our interpretation can be similar: Our
past  is neither an accident nor a mistake. We have been where
we needed to be, with the necessary people. We can embrace our
history, with its pain, its imperfections, and its mistakes, even its
tragedies. It is uniquely ours; it was intended just for us.

Today, we are right where we need to be. Our present circumstances
are exactly as they need to be - for now.

Today, I will let go of my guilt and fear about my past and present
circumstances. I will trust that where I have been and where I am
now are right for me.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep It Simple*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Don't Follow Me
by Alan Cohen

I saw a bumper sticker proclaiming, &quot;Don't follow me -- I'm
following my bliss.&quot; Good advice! How much more creative
and successful would your life be if you remained true to your
own inner guidance rather than imitating the paths chosen
by others?

When you are secure in who you are, you set the trend for
your own life, and do not look to others to tell you how to live.
I remember seeing Julia Roberts show up unannounced on
the David Letterman show one night, clad in jeans and a tee
shirt, with no make-up and her hair not styled. The audience
gave Julia a rousing welcome, and then she had a
lighthearted spontaneous interview with Letterman. Everyone
was thrilled to see her, and no one cared that she was not
glamorous that evening.

Authenticity yields far more power than ostentation. Sometimes
people become confident in themselves because they are
successful, but always people become successful because
they are confident.

For many years I wore a jacket and tie when I spoke in
churches, simply because I thought I should be appropriate.
Yet all the while I felt totally unnatural and hated it. Then one
night I asked Wayne Dyer what he wore when he spoke at
the same churches. &quot;A sweater -- or whatever,&quot; Wayne told
me nonchalantly. &quot;I don't even own a jacket and tie.&quot;

That did it. I realized that Wayne had been true to himself,
but I had not. I squirmed as I remembered the title of some
of my talks: &quot;Dare to be yourself.&quot; That was the end of the
jacket and tie era for me. Other men love to wear a jacket and
tie. To be true to themselves, they must dress up. To be true to
me, I must dress comfortably. Realness is an inside job.

In Monty Python's hilarious film Life of Brian, a scofflaw during
the time of Jesus eludes Roman soldiers by disguising himself
as a pundit. Brian finds a soapbox in the town square and
spouts mock words of wisdom. As soon as the soldiers depart,
Brian makes a beeline for the city limits, only to discover that
he is being followed by a crowd of students. Soon the throng
grows from hundreds to thousands, begging their master to
teach them. Finally Brian turns and chides them, &quot;I'm not your
master -- Just go away!&quot;

&quot;But master!&quot; a voice cries out from the crowd, &quot;tell us how we
should go away.&quot;

Many of us have given our power, money, and minds to people
whom we believe can tell us how to live. And many teachers
have given us good advice. But advice is useful only if it resonates
deep within us in a place that feels like home. So the teacher did
not give us anything we did not already have; he or she just
pointed us to what we already knew. A consultant is someone
who borrows your watch to tell you what time it is.A guru is
someone who sits by the bank of a river selling bottles of river
water. Anyone could just go directly to the river and obtain water
without going through a middle party. There are two kinds of
gurus: those who get their students hooked on bottled water
and keep upping the price, and those who show their students
how to get their own water. The best teachers are those who
work themselves out of a job.

Years ago I got involved with a cult led by a teacher who
claimed to be enlightened. The students in this organization
worshipped the teacher more than the teachings, and I went
right along with the hype. I gave my power away to this man
and I did things just to fit in with the crowd. But every time fit
in, I sold out. Eventually a scandal revealed that the teacher
had been lying to the students and engaging in covert activities
contrary to his teachings.

When the debacle became public, I felt ripped off, betrayed, and
angry. I blamed the teacher for fooling me. After some
introspection, however, I realized that I had fooled myself. If I
had been true to myself, I never would have become one of the
sheep. Then I began to appreciate the experience. I realized
that the purpose of my involvement with the teacher was not
the lessons he gave, but for me to learn to follow my own spirit
rather than the herd. Suddenly the whole process became
immensely valuable to me, and I laughed about it. It was worth
the experience to learn how to respect my sacred self rather
than external authority.

When you know that every truth you seek is available within
you, you will not place someone else's idea of how you should
live, above your own. There are many roads to the mountaintop,
but the only one that will take you all the way is the one with
your name on it.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*One Day At A Time*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Law Of Life

Whatever you give away today,
Or think or say or do;
Will multiply about ten fold,
And then return to you.

It may not come immediately,
Nor from the obvious source;
But the law applies unfailingly,
Through some invisible force.

Whatever you feel about another,
Be it love or hate or passion;
Will surely bounce back to you,
In some clear or secret fashion.

If you speak about some person,
A word of praise or two;
Soon tens of other people,
Will speak kind words of you.

Our thoughts are broadcasts of the soul,
Not secrets of the brain;
Kind ones bring us happiness,
Petty ones, untold pain.

Giving works as surely as,
Reflections in a mirror;
If hate you send, hate you'll get back,
But loving brings love nearer.

Remember, as you start this day,
And duty, crowds your mind;
That kindness comes so quickly back,
To those who first are kind.

Let that thought and this one,
Direct you through each day;
The only things we ever keep,
Are the things we give away.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*First Things First*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Courage

Courage is admitting that you're afraid
and facing that fear directly.
It's being strong enough to ask for help and humble enough to accept it.
Courage is standing up for what you believe in
without worrying about the opinions of others.
It's following your own heart, living your own life,
and settling for nothing less than the best for yourself.
Courage is daring to take a first step, a big leap, or a different path.
It's attempting to do something
that no one has done before, and all others
thought impossible.
Courage is keeping heart in the face of disappointment,
and looking at defeat not as an end but as a new beginning.
It's believing that things will ultimately
get better even as they get worse.
Courage is being responsible for your own actions,
and admitting your own mistakes without placing blame on others.
It's relying not on others for your
success, but on your own skills and efforts.
Courage is refusing to quit even when you're intimidated by
impossibility.
It's choosing a goal, sticking with it,
and finding solutions to the problems.
Courage is thinking big, aiming high,
and shooting far.
It's taking a dream and doing anything,
risking everything,
and stopping at nothing to make it a reality.

Dawning of Reality

I woke up one morning and for some reason
I looked in the mirror for the first time in years.
My skin color was a sickly gray,
after changing from a greenish, yellow color.
My eyes still glowed a golden yellow.
I was skin and bones.
I was so sick and dazed from the itching
that kept me awake at night and the numerous trips
to the bathroom, when I made it that far.
I was alone, but I never felt so degraded, so low, so tired.
My stomach burned, like the inside was raw meat,
and I ached all over.
Tears were streaming down the face of the person
I didn't even recognize.
I pleaded &quot; Help me&quot;, and at that moment I knew
that I could never live this way again.
I looked around at the filth and squalor of the little trailer
I lived in, all the empty liquor bottles crowded around
in that small camper, got sick,
and stumbled back to my filthy bed
and I prayed like I'd never prayed before
cause I knew my life was over and
I just realized for the first time that I wanted to live.
I was one of the lucky ones who was given yet another chance.

Red Heart

Red heart is raw, ripe for the harvest.
Gently we lift each other off our branches,
careful not to bruise our fragile pride.
Red heart is rare, steak on a plate,
dripping with the savory juices of life.
Red heart is warm embers, soft memories
of birth and life, of love shared freely
with no fear too great to beat it down.
Red heart is hot copper skies, aflame
with hope; joyous unity rides each cloud.
Red heart is rhythm, pounding
count for the dancers, all moving
to the music inside their souls.
Red heart is a mother’s womb, releasing
and reveling in the miracle that she holds.
Red heart beats faster, pumps rich, red blood
through the connected veins of our lives,
nurturing and nourishing us all.
Red heart is reflection, a brilliant burning sun
alive on a calm, crystalline pool.
Red heart feels the numbing pain we share
with each other, every time a back is turned
upon another soul in need.
Red heart is open, and through its common pulse
civilization may be freed.
