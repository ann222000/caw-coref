Finally finished the Mirabilia 2006 cherub and posted a photo in RCTNP
if anyone would  care to see it. Though I noticed also that there's
finally a photo - not just the chart - on the Mirabilia site, too.

http://www.mirabilia.com/crossIndex2.html

I started stitching her based on just the chart, and there's lots of
metallic and beads. She turned out more colorful that I at first
expected. I've been calling her "The Angel of Bling!"

Very, very pretty.

I also noticed that when you stitched Miss Mary Mack, you stitched that
whole button border.  You have my admiration for doing that.  I took the
easy way out.

Hi Sue, I lurk here from time to time. I love the pictures of your work and
had to tell you that I especially like the way you have finished two of the
items with cord. I have not seen that before and love the idea.

Thank you all! I always do finish my ornaments with twisted cord, and
have lately started doing some slightly larger pieces the same way to
avoid the expense of framing. Thank goodness for the mini-twister!

And I use cords in other ways, too...right now I'm wearing a lovely
silver pendant that DD gave me as a gift. Rather than buying a chain, I
bought three or four skeins of rayon floss to make a cord, and voila! (A
friend later put a silver clasp on the back.)  I get compliments all the
time on it, and I think, "Yeah, $3 and 5 minutes...." Also did a cord
like that for wearing my Clover thread-cutter pendant.

Your cherub is lovely.  She must have been fun to do.

Another good use for cord is to finish the edge of a bellpull.  I have also
attached a tassel to the point at the bottom that I made from the same
floss.  It looks very nice done that way.

That is very nce work indeed. I like the twisted cord as well.  Would
you care to share how that is done?  Is the fabric stretched on a
piece of foam core first?  Then the cord  pinned/glued to the edges?

Is the hanging loop a part of the framing cord or an addtional piece?
Lots and lots of questions :^}

I can see myself doing that. After I had completed a small silk flower
kit, I took one each of the four colors of floss and  stitched a  oval
around the flower to take the place of a mat.  Looked great in the
tiny square (cheap) frame I found, but I think this would have been
better.

Thanks for asking. Here's how I do my ornaments:

1.) Stitch design for front and choose appropriate fabric for back.

2.) Cut TWO pieces of acid-free matboard to the finished size.

3.) Cut TWO pieces of batting just slightly larger (1/4"-3/8" all
around) than mat board.

4.) Cut front and back fabric about 1"-1.5" (on all sides) larger than
mat board.

5.) Optional: line the linen front (and the backing) with gold or silver
tissue lame. (The sparkles can be seen slightly through the backing
fabric and give a nice "glow" to the finished ornament). If you choose
to do this, zigzag with sewing machine around the linen and lame,
joining them in one piece.

6.) Lace the front over one piece of matboard, placing batting between
mat and fabric (being careful to center design!). Lace the backing over
another piece of matboard, again with batting between matboard and
fabric. (that's for rectangular ornaments. For circular/oval ones,
gather around edge with long basting stitches, pull up around matboard
and batting, then lace gathered piece on the back.)

7.) Put the two pieces of matboard back-to-back and stitch together all
the way around. (I stitch tiny stitches all the way around in one
direction, then come back in the other direction to "cross" the first
stitch. Leave a 1" or so "gap" where you'll put the hanger part of the
cord. (center top for single hanger, on the side - one or both - for
hanger that attaches there.)

8.) Make a cord with 3-6 skeins of DMC, depending on heaviness desired.
I usually find that using two adjacent shades of colors - for example,
814 and 815 - give "depth" to the color of the cord.

9.)Push the end of the cord down into the hole you left (in the case of
Mirabilia cherub, center top). (You may need to use your embroidery
scissors to push it into the hole). Start stitching cord around edge
(whipstitch), hiding stitches in the "twist" of the cord.

10.) When you get all the way around, you can either "loop" the cord and
insert the end into the "gap" left, then sew it all together, or you can
make a fancy knot at the center, and bury the loose end inside the gap.
Depends on what effect you want it to have.

Hope that's clear. If not, ask and I'll try to clarify!

Sue

I stitched a couple Marbek angels on fabric with metallic gold woven in.
By stitching with 2 strands instead of 3, a bit of the metallic gold
sparkles through the stitching, giving the angels a nice otherworldly
glow.  You may want to try that option, too.

I know Nordic Needle had been selling some of the sparkly fabrics, if
you need a source.

I've stitched with that fabric, too. But I use lining partly because I
don't want to see batting behind the fabric, and sometimes when you look
closely you can see what's behind the fabric. It just gives it a more
"finished" look.

And the lame is very subtle - think 25% max. of the "sparkle factor" of
the linen with metallic woven in.

Thank you Sue

Yes you are as clear as text without pictures can be!  I am going to
save this in my own reference collection.  There is more than I had
thought.  I hadn't a clue that you had dealt with covering the back as
well.

When I finished Superstition Mountains I took the hint to put a same
colored cloth underneath before stretching it on backing.  It did
really make it look nicer, so the lame' idea will be a winner as well.

Hmmm wonder if a US Army seal woul look good with olive drab and brown
twisted cord.  Have to show DH and have a consultation.
