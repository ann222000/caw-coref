I don't know if this has been discussed,but if it has ,my apologies in
advance.
I read the paper and find an estate auction in Sarasota,preview
at 10:00a.m. and auction starting at noon on Saturday. I get up
early,check the tires,oil,water,etc. and fill up with gas and with
trusty tapemeasure,magnet,
loupe,flashlight,notepad and wantslist, take off for Sarasota. Ninety
minutes later I'm onsite and examing the 300 lots available. I've picked
out about 30 items that would fit in my shop and I'm prepared to take
them all.
The auction lasts until 4:30 and everything that I wanted went to
someone else for a higher price than I could have asked for it in my
shop.
Everything that is ,except, an oak drysink that I got for $185, plus the
10% buyers premium.
Since the drysink was #296 of the 300 items in the sale, I find
myself at the end of a line 53 people long. Shortly after 6:00p.m. I'm
paid and loaded up and on my way home. At 7:45 I'm home to a leftover
dinner and a warm soak in the tub. Later that night, I take the drysink
out to my shop and &quot;spruce&quot; it up for sale the next day.
Ah, Sunday morning,and here I am after only six years in the
business and with a shop located in a lowly flea market atmosphere, all
anxious to get out there and open up for what I hope will be a throng of
wealthy shoppers.
Now,I've been here all day and sold a few items,when I spy someone
checking out the drysink. As I approach,I'm going over in my head,the
particulars of the drysink. Let's see, I paid $203.50, spent the day,no
lunch, a tank of gas and I've marked the drysink $299.
Would you like this delivered or are you going to take it with you
,I quip. Well, what's the &quot;best&quot; you can do ? Well, if your serious
about wanting it and your going to take it with you, I can let you have
it for $275. Oh, I'm a Dealer, what's the &quot;lowest you'll go&quot; on it?
O.K., I'm thinking, its getting late,the rents due on the shop in two
days, how about $265, I reply.
Well, I'm a Dealer and I have a shop in New York and another in Miami
and I'll have to get it there and all,I'll give you $200.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid that I paid more than that for it (now feeling
stupid for having paid so much and wondering why &quot;they&quot; let &quot;me&quot; be the
high bidder)
Well it has a scratch on the side and even though it's on carpet,it
looks like it going to wobble on my parquet showroom, I can go as high
as $220,she says.
Make it $250 and I'll wrap it up, I say.
I'll go get my car and here's a check for $230,drawn on Ed's Bank in New
York City
( NEW YORK CITY thinks I, thinking of the salsa commercial AND when did
she Write that check, she hasn't been out of my sight).
O.K., O.K., let me go write you out a receipt. I say.
Later that night as I arrive home, my wife (the one with the REAL
job) asks, how'd you do today ? Oh, great,swell, I sold that nice oak
drysink to a DEALER from New York CIty
(leaving out the selling price) and I'd have been home sooner,but I
helped her load it into the trunk of her Cadillac Stationwagon.
Oh, that's nice dear,says the wife.
Another day,another Dealer,another DOLLAR.

ultimately separate the men and the women from the boys and the girls in the

&gt;hours driving time,7 hours at an auction site and 1 hour taking it out

&gt; Please be kind enough to explain to me how you arrived at the 8000%
&gt;figure,I'm still using my fingers and toes for counting. If I truly made
&gt;8000%,then, even I can see that I'm pricing my items too high.

"/> First of all, you are NOT pricing your stuff too high .... at least if this is
any example .... it flew out of your shop, didn't it? And given this new
information you provided about your gas expenses, your return wasn't that high
.... but it still isn't too shabby. And I thought you indicated a sale at
$250 with part payment the $230 check .... so the ROI isn't at the 8000%
level, but regardless it is still pretty high. OK ... this isn't really
something that can/should be explained fully in a newsgroup post, but.....
here goes.

You &quot;invested&quot; $203.50 in the dry sink. ONE DAY later you sold it for a
$26.50 gross profit. That represents an increase of a bit over 13% above the
investment. But you only held it for ONE DAY, and interest is an ANNUAL
concept .... if you had put the money in a bank at a 13% interest rate,
assuming you could find it, you would have to leave the funds in there for a
full year before your account balance would reach $230 .... but you did it in
one day. Multiplying that 13% by 360 days in a year gives 4680% .... like I
said, not too shabby. (all these figures are rough, you understand, for
purposes of easy illustration) Notice that every extra day you hold that
piece cuts your return on investment ... if you sold it on monday, your return
would only be 2340%; hold it for a month, 156%; 6 months, 26%; the full year,
13%.

Of course the challenge is to take your profit from the venture (from each
sale) and purchase something else that can be sold quickly. This is known as
inventory turnover, and the better you can do this, the more you make. And
too many dealers have a nasty habit of sitting on a piece far too long, rather
than selling it for less and reinvesting their proceeds ... holding out for
the highest possible price is a prescription for mediocre profits.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I guess my point (not the one on my head) was that I was feeling
&gt;the consignor,the auctioneer and the N.Y. dealer (NEW YORK DEALER) made

&gt;the worst. Or, maybe I'm the only one that second guesses themselves.

"/> No, you are not the only second guesser .... but you really need to stop

There are lots of &quot;dealers&quot; out there who are really just hobbiests, and any
profit is probably serendipitous .... the antique business likely rivals the
restaurant business for sheer numbers of folk who are just marking time,
economically speaking. Too often they lack a basic understanding of just
how their industry works .... pity! Someday there's a book in all of this.

Doug,
Your first mistake was letting another dealer set prices in your shop. Do
you think that same dealer would let you do that in her shop in N.Y.? I
don't think so. I like to work with dealers if I can. Sometimes we all know
that this is not possible.
However I have one golden rule that I will not break. When I give a dealer
a fair discount and he/she turns to me and says with a curled lip, &quot; I'll
give you--------- &quot;, bang. There is no discount, full ticket price. Then
some of them will say, &quot; maybe your right, I'll take it for the dealers
discounted price &quot;. Nope, that price is gone. Thank you very much, you
have a nice day and I walk away.
I spend a lot of time finding these things, cleaning them up, displying
them in a shop thats well lit and pleasant to shop in. I'll be damned if I
will let these nose up in the air, rude realers tell me what they will give
me. One dealer started with, well I have to get someone to come up here and
pick it up and then I have to find room in my shop and I don't really need
this piece , but I'll give you---------. My reply was
NOT IN YOUR LIFETIME.

"/> Hi Doug, think this is really good advice from Barry, you made profit
quickly on your dry sink, the dealer that bought it was happy, because
she bought it near her price, so in theory she'll make a profit,
everybody is happy and the next time she's in your neck of the woods
more than likely she'll remember the deal and call with you again.

If you choose to sell to the trade, I think its got to work this way.
For example in my case, say I bought an item for 60 and it normally
retails (to Joe) around 100-120, if I sell it to another dealer I'm
willing to take 70-75 for it, which leaves a profit for the other
dealer. Dealers in my area know I deal this way, so I choose to sell
most of my stock to other dealers. It gives me a lower profit per item
but a faster turnover, so I get my money back quicker and re-invest it
in something else and go again. Most times they'll buy quaintity and
lumping several items together for a job price will usually work in my
favour. Or, I'll give a real good price on a quality piece if they
take a few not so good items in a job lot. Same if I've bought one
good item and a couple of real dogs in a deal, I'll not split that
deal if the trade wish to buy the good item and will pass the whole
lot on as one deal. If an item stick with me, say more than a month,
I'll take my money back on it, or even sell at a slight loss. The loss
I'll make up on another deal somewheres down the line. I also tend to
buy goods that are desirable within the 'trade' rather than buying all
those fad and trendy dime and cent pieces that every other dealer in
the area is selling, also unusual items of stock will 'always' attract
more attention than run-of-the-mill items and unusual stuff will not
normally have a fixed price range, so they not off looking up
priceguides. Maybe none of this applies in the US, but where Iam the
business is much more dependent on inner dealing with other
traders/collectors and of course the shippers, were I think the real
business lies.- Just my thoughts. :)

The driving to Sarasota is a worst case scenario,as most of stock
is bought locally at auctions ( which I enjoy attending even if I don't
leave with much).
I guess my point (not the one on my head) was that I was feeling
the consignor,the auctioneer and the N.Y. dealer (NEW YORK DEALER) made
out the best and the person that invested the time,sweat and money fared
the worst. Or, maybe I'm the only one that second guesses themselves.
I'm aware that most customers at a flea market didn't head out looking
for an &quot;antique shop&quot; but rather BARGAINS.. It's getting harder and
harder to find true antiques at a price where you can resell them at a
flea market. I now find myself often with solid wood furniture stuck in
with the antiques. I refuse to put &quot;pressed wood&quot; or &quot;particle board&quot;
furniture or &quot;plastic&quot; mirrors in my shop even though neighboring
dealers apparently are making money doing so. The flea market where I'm
located is only open on Sat. &amp; Sun., so I have 56 hours a month at the
shop to make the $300 rent and a &quot;profit&quot;. Thank goodness for mail,phone
and possibly internet sales. Without these,I'd have to get a &quot;Real&quot;job.
regards,

Doug W.

&gt;Another day,another Dealer,another DOLLAR.

"/> Here's the way I look at it Doug. You made a sale, you made some money.
This NEW YORK CITY DEALER may haul this thing all the way to NYC where it
might sit for a very long time. Sure, they might make a heck of a profit
on it, since it is a different market, but it might sit, taking up space
and collecting dust.

I bought a bunch of stuff at auction once, paid reasonable prices, brought
them in the shop. A week later the manager there wants to buy them, will I
make him a deal? I sold them to him for twice what I paid and he was very
happy. He marked them up, a lot higher than I had them marked, and they
are still sitting there three months later. Since this shop has done
nothing but screw me over sonce I started there you can imamgine the joy I
feel seeing those things sit! But.....that's another story.

Bottom line, Doug, you made a sale.

You are into the essence of why many antique dealers don't make any money.

Taken by itself this sale looks like great return on investment.
Unfortunately all sales made by dealers are not so swift. Several years
back an article in Maine Antique Digest pointed out that a typical antique
dealer takes several years to have a single inventory turn. Most
businesses turn their inventory several times per year and the
some successful businesses have infinite turns, living out of someone
else's inventory.

You need to decide if you are a dealer selling to retail customers, or a
picker selling to other dealers.

A dealer selling to retail will have substantial inventory, turn it slowly
and mark it up enough to have sufficient profit margin to not only cover
his costs of doing business but also maintain positive cash flow.

A successful picker will turn his inventory rapidly selling at a modest
markup to his dealers and then recovering the costs of remaining
inventory through auction or flea market. We know several pickers who
never have inventory for more than a week.

The retailer with a shop who hasn't come to terms with who his customers
are, always feels beaten up when he makes a dealer sale (unless of course
he is blissfully ignorant to what he owns).

Why did you make this sale which made you unhappy? Did you need the money
desparately? Was this out of town dealer going to become a regular
customer? Do you just not know how to say no? Bad business is worse than
no business. If this was a great piece you might have made your sale at
your price in a day or two.

I've been where you are, and I hope moved past it. We sell in various
ways and do identify merchandise as being for retail and for dealer sales.
We don't seek to sell other dealers merchandise in which we have
significant investment, and are not accommadating in pricing of such
items. There are other items which we feel lack retail appeal which we
buy when the price is right and only sell to dealers - through different
channels than we use for retail sales.

I feel that if you can buy something, clean it up and make a profit big
or small so be it. Why would anyone be critical of entrepreneurship.
We all like to make money and so why is everyone grumbling because a
dealer made $26.00 profit. I would like to be able to turn over items
that quickly and make a 13% profit. I wonder how many times that the
same dealer has sold something at a loss or less than what he paid -
think about it. If the purchaser was happy then there should be no
problem. This is just my view point. Enough said. Hazel

"/> Hazel, no business can stay in business under the criteria of this
particular transaction - if ALL transactions in that business are
conducted in that manner.
He didn't really make $26 - that was the difference between what he
bought and sold it for. And does not include his travel expenses
to and from the auction...meals, etc.
Normal retail mark-up is 100% (buy something for $45, pay shipping
and mark it at $100.) If you have to take a discount, you've got some
maneuvering room.
Unfortunately, the root cause of this particular transaction is the
auction -- and auctions are increasingly places where the public
and the dealer are bidding on the same items. And the public
often pays more for the same item at auction, than they would if
they purchased it from the antique dealer.
The &quot;buy low sell high&quot; strategy is ALL there is. Watching the
margins. It's good to have some showpiece items of lesser
margin - but the meat and potatoes of the business will normally
prove to be $50 sales (and one daren't pay more than $20 for
those items.)

I don't know if you overpaid or sold too low (and too quickly.)
I'm assuming that you thought you paid a fair price for the
piece at auction - and then you put time and effort into
making it salable (let alone the expenses you incurred
in travel.)

Turning your money over quickly is one thing -- but selling
below a profit margin isn't business. Either you had it priced
too low in the first place, or paid too much initially. Only you

But I'll bet you don't do that again!

at a fair price, before he unloaded it to the first insistent

In fact, the insistence of the dealer who made the purchase for
$26 over what he paid might have been a good CLUE that the
item was worth about twice what he was selling it for (or even
more.) Otherwise, why would a dealer have been interested in
the first place?

&gt; at a fair price, before he unloaded it to the first insistent

Listen Kris I have dealers from England that buy certain stuff in
Ireland, .... because .... the certain stuff isn't rated in Ireland
but sell well in England, so that's my BEST market for such stuff, I
don't care what the English dealer gets for it. I buy certain stuff
because I know some-out-of-town dealer will buy it and maybe buy ten
if I have ten.

"/>  A genuinely old dry sink should be very marketable. It's a
wood cabinet that was used to hold the accoutrements of
washing dishes, in old kitchens without plumbing (hence,
&quot;dry&quot; sink.)
No, not frightened to sell....but if I had $100 in an item, I'd
have initially made sure I could at least price it for $200 or
more, and if it didn't sell after what I feel is a reasonable
time, I'd THEN reduce the price.

"/>  I don't have a shop - I sell online and at antique shows.
When I do a show, I obviously can't take everything I have -
so I &quot;rotate my stock&quot; and those remaining 21 items (which
are good) are just packed away. So, it is &quot;forward buying.&quot;
A very knowledgeable dealer told me once:
Never get in a rush to sell anything that's GOOD
- Antiques only get older
- There's a butt for every saddle (a phrase used here
in the Western US to mean &quot;there's a buyer for
every item&quot;)
- Pricing too low is as bad as pricing too high
- DUMP your errors (avoid junk)
- If it sells too quickly, look for another one and price
it higher!
- If you're selling at shows, always take different items!

&gt;What is this. &quot;good CLUE that the item was worth about twice what he

"/>  No, Doug didn't post a follow-up.
Didn't Doug sell this item within 2 days of putting it up for sale?

It was obvious, at least to me, that he did have a very good
item that he could have sold for much more -- or not settled
for the very deep discount that the dealer offered. The dealer
bought it because s/he could mark it up 100% or more. Doug
could have done the same thing. What's so magic about
that dealer, as opposed to what Doug settled for in this sale?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What you mean is, everything U buy, you just double (or maybe triple)
up and blunder on until you find the 'real' selling level of the item.

"/> reasonable time? ......... what like 7years? or until you realized
there weren't any mugs about, that were prepared to pay your over
infalted prices.

If when you bought the item and it was supposedly worth 200 (or more)
what conditions have changed that now makes it NOT worth 200? Come
Kris your feeling the market, either because your being greedy or you
are unsure of the real value of objects.

So what did you buy in 1990 that was so wonderful that it has been
packed away for seven years, someday to be revealed? You have tied
money up for seven years ...... what sort of investment return do you
expect after seven years? It would need to be one HELL of a return.
How many times within seven years could you have turned this same
''invested'' money around with profit each time?
