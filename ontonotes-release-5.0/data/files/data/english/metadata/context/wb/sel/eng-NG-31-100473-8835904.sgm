I was driving on a local street around here, and suddenly my RPM was
at 5000. The car shifted out of gear on its own. I stopped and
attempted to put it into gear, but it wont go, any any gear, reverse
doesn't work. The fluid was changed about 1000 miles ago, and the
transmission drove excellent before, no slips or delays at all. I use
the shifter a lot to down shift frequently, could it be the electrical
piece the shifter linkage connects to. The fluid is not low or over
filled and is not burnt. Vacuum line is connected as well. Any ideas?
Again it drove fine before, had no signs of eminent failure. The
reverse lights come on when in gear also.

Check fluid level again. Otherwise, I would say your tranny is a toast.

On the pass side of the trans, just above the oil pan gasket, is a flat area.
Stamped into it will be the transmission serial number. The first 6 digits is the type and model. It
should start 722 and then it may be 302 or 311.
That tells you it is a 722.3XX trans. The 380 in the 126 body used a 722.301 or 722.311. They will
not interchange. Choices are the 126 body 500 SE or the 500SEC. It has to be the 126 body because of
the electric speedometer.

What is your complete VIN?
WDB126037????????

UPDATE:

I found a transmission. Its from a 1985 500 SEL. Car was wrecked in
the front. Has 93,000 miles on it. The fluid from that trans was very
clean and didnt smell burnt. Judging by how the car looked, it was
well taken car of and the miles were actual. VERY clean looking car
inside. I got it for $450. Im gonna start installing it myself
tomorrow.

Well I got the replacement transmission installed and its driving
excellent, even better than it did before. Not sure what went wrong
with the old one, but who cares is all done now.

The yard I got the replacement transmission didn't want the old one
for a core, nor did they have a core charge. Is this normal?

Wow, congratulations.  That is a quick job.

Rebuilders take core.  Yards don't.  They don't need a broken one which
can't sell :-)

By the way, where are you?  Or I mean where the yard is?

All the self-serve yards here in Calif charge for the core. They are in the
scrap metal business. Most full serve yards want the core to sell to
rebuilders.

What frosts me is the sales tax. If you do not bring the core in at the time
of sale, they charge you the core charge + sales tax. When you bring back
the core, they refund the core charge but NOT the sales tax. Totally legal
according to the State Board of Equalization. Total robbery!

My pet peeve is the restaurants that charge sales tax on the full price,
then take off the discount, say on a 2 for 1 deal.  It should be
discount, than tax on the discounted price.  After all, that is the
sales they report to the state.

Unfortunately, that IS the way that the tax law reads. (At least it does
here)
