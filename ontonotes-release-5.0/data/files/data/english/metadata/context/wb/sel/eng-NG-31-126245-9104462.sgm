On a TV program yesterday, introducing a Yokohama neighborhood, the
narrator (reading from a script) kept using the expression 数百以上
when talking about the large number of eating and drinking
establishments.

Does this strike anyone else but me as strange Japanese? And if it is
normal Japanese, how would you translate it into good English? We
wouldn't say, &quot;several hundred or more shops,&quot; would we?

The show also made it clear that the actual number was around 300, so
the expression couldn't be taken to mean &quot;several hundred or more than a
thousand.&quot;

Google indicates that the expression &quot;several hundred or more&quot; is quite
common. Another possibility would be simply &quot;hundreds or more.&quot;

Definitely. That is exactly what popped into my mind upon reading
Wataru San's message.  Or to make it seem like it ain't just hundreds,
but actually a lot more, I might try (though not for a serious job)
'hundreds and hundreds' of shops.

But what does that mean? If the number is between, say, 300 and 900,
then isn't &quot;several hundred&quot; by itself clear enough? What does the &quot;or

I would prolly simply say &quot;at least several hundred&quot; and leave it at
that, but I think &quot;hundreds of&quot; works well too.

Apparently, this narrative was your typical dose of commercial TV
hyperbole. If the wish were to replicate the narrative, then it's
conceivable that a transparent translator could have reason to work it
so as to present even the hyperbolic aspect. Then the concern might be
less about figuring out how to conventionalize the phrase in English,
and in a certain sense more about coming up with equivalent
hyperbolese. &quot;... hundreds upon hundreds of restaurants and pubs..&quot; as a
tame example.

Stylistically frownable hyperbolese is about as old-as-the-hills and
commonplace as grass...
Wonder how grass's doin these days in places like downtown Tokyo,
anyway...

It probably means that the list we checked had say 290, but
not all of them are listed, so we will throw out a vague 数百
(stay tuned if you want to find out how many we are thinking
of with that), and then say that there are even more.

This reminds me of that expression not uncommonly found in patents:

一つか二つ以上

I usually write &quot;one or more&quot;, although I've seen translations with
&quot;one or two or more&quot;, which sounds strange to me.

For 数百以上, since it is just TV, I'd say &quot;hundreds of&quot; or &quot;loads of&quot;

I'm not a native speaker, but maybe in TV-talk 以上 is meant to have an
emphatic sense or something like that.  It doesn't seem to make
logical or arithmetical sense.

I'm sure none of *us* would, but I've seen something roughly similar
in English.

An ad running in the USA for a debt-consolidation service has the
line &quot;if you're at least 5,000, 10,000, or 50,000 dollars in debt...&quot;

Logically they should stop after 5,000, but clearly they want to
emphasize they're handling much larger debts than that.

数百以上ねえ。
書きたくないし、見たら直したくなりますね。
でも一体、どこがおかしかったんだったっけ？？

わかりました。 (sigh; what took me so long)
飲み屋やバーなら「数百軒以上」が正解ですね。

以上が数量につく場合は、
「二歳以上」「八キログラム以上」のように
〈数詞＋助数詞類〉の形になるんでした。

英語に無いから日本語にならない、
そんな翻訳調に慣れてしまいそうです。

Not only that, but unquestioningly their target reader is neither as

Even with this rendition, what exactly is the 以上 representing?  The 数
百軒 is already representing a variable number, so is the 以上 just
trying to say that the number is not necessarily divisible by 100, or is
it just fluff to put forth the &quot;a lot&quot; idea?

Eric:

My interpretation of this is that 以上 represents whatever is higher than
an accepted and reasonable understanding of what 数百 means.

If one considers 数百 to be around 300, then 以上 means more than 300.

Thank you, Eric, for getting to the heart of the matter and stating the

Sorry to throw you off. The actual words used in the TV program were
in fact「数百軒以上」. My problem is trying to figure out the logic of
the 「以上」part when added to a non-precise numerical description.

It sounds like the term is just fluff and should be taken as nothing more
than colloquial speech used to elicit the warm-n-fuzzies (TM).  In other
words, you are thinking too much.  Of course, the question of how to elicit
the same level of warm-n-fuzzies in English is not trivial, though phrases
like &quot;hundreds of&quot; would definitely seem to get the meaning across.

While I am not disagreeing with this description, if we are trying to come
up with a strict, formal definition for what this means, we are still left
with the question of how much 数百 should represent and whether or not the
以上 can take us up into 千-land.

That's a good question. 数百 is basically less than 1,000, but 数百以上
may include more than 1,000.

Back to Wataru's original query:

I see nothing strange about the above expression. Maybe because I'm
Japanese? &lt;g&gt;

">

Well, if 300 is included in 数百, it is included in 数百以上 as well. So
(mathematically and grammatically) it's not incorrect to call some 300
shops as 数百以上の shops. The point or effect of using 数百以上 in
cases like this is to make the number sound a bit larger than when just
数百 is used. (Whether this borders on cheating or not is debatable.)
