Can a bad floppy kill a 1571?

My 1571 is acting badly. It will read some floppies, but not others.
It will absolutely not format anymore. I think I can pinpoint when
this began. I just got a bunch of C= floppies on auction. One original
floppy was apparently in poor condition, when I tried to use it the
drive made very bad crunching, screeching sounds. Oops :-/

Could a bad floppy screw up a drive head? Alignment?

Also this drive is occasionally not accepting disk change, I have to
power up and down not to get disk mismatch ID. I think this is a
separate issue. I did Ray Carlsen's 1571 write protect disable switch.
When I first did it it worked like gangbusters for a while, but even
before the recent problem I started occasionally get disk mismatch ID
errors. I opened the drive and inspected the mod, visually everything
is still in place. I'll probably undo the mod until this is worked
out.

Thoughts on a bad/old disk damaging a drive?

Without question.... YES

What I really don't like here is the &quot;crunching-squeeling sound&quot; ...

Crunching --  the floppie came apart in the jacket ???

Squeeling...  the drive stepper motor kept tring to load it... but it
was STUCK --big-time...
----- so the drive motor kept spining... untill it overheated the
belt.. and damaged it. ( or glazed it )

-- I'm 99% sure the 1571 was belt driven..( I don't have one here to
confirm that anymore... and I hated that drive anyway, so I only had
one in my lifetime) ... but like any floppy drive..  the drive belt
can become damaged, or stretched... or just plain dirty from nicotine
smoke ect.

You can &quot;pop the top&quot; and everything &quot;looks OK&quot; ( the drive head moves
still ect. ) ... but when the drive has to do the famous C=ommodore
Hammer&quot;  to format a disk, or read a 1/2 track or something,  the belt
is simply to loose to keep the head in the proper position.

Pull the whole drive down...  the &quot;belt&quot;  ( more like an o-ring ) can
be &quot;dressed&quot; with the same stuff you use to dress belts on your car...
spray a little on a cue tip... make the drive spin up a few times, by
turning it on and off, whilst holding the saturated q-tip to the
belt.... DON'T overdue the Q-tip thing !!... spray the crap on the Q-
tip, and then &quot;ring it out&quot; with your fingers first, so it is just
damp.

Over the years I had to do this a number of times with the BBs
drive's, because I'm a heavy smoker, and the belts would get gummed up

----  if you scratched the read/write head of the drive because of
sand or such on that yard sale floppie....  you now have a nice
paperweight for your desktop, so important papers don't fly off in a
breeze.

Also------  I would litterly... cut the plastic jacket that hold the
culprit media.... and remove the actuall disk inside it ( you got
nothing to lose here)  and see if you can find a reason for that
&quot;crunching&quot; sound ?? ... if for no other reason... you should know
what destroyed your drive.

Rick

P.S.  Let us know what you fond inside the jacket

Yes, as attested to by our treasurer who has
ruined several drives when reading scores of C=
disks via Big Blue Reader.

Problems formatting are probably not an alignment problem.  When the heads
are out of alignment the drive will have problems when trying to read a disk
from another drive, or even a disk that was written on the drive in question
_before_ it went out of alignment.

You most likely know this, but be sure the disks you are trying to format are
DD (Double Density) and not HD (High Density) disks.  The 1571 does not like
HD disks at all!

Were the disk preformatted?  I have had trouble formatting disks that were
preformatted for IBM (MS-DOS) machines.  They would usually format OK on the
second or third try.  So, try formatting the same disk three times and see
what happens.  That might burn a little of your time, but otherwise won't
hurt anything.    :-)

Also, the 1571 is prone to problems with the spring device that positions the
upper head on the disk.  Look that over closely.  You might try sending the
command to place the drive in 1541 mode and then try formatting a disk as
single sided.  If you can format a disk as single sided (1541 mode) but not
as double sided (1571 mode) then the upper head positioning is the problem.

I think there is more info about the upper head on Ray Carlsen's website.

Sounds like the drive is not detecting a disk change.  Instead of cycling
power try sending an initialize command and see what happens.

I guess you have already tried cleaning the heads with a cotton swab and
alcohol?  I have heard reports of cleaning disks screwing up upper head
positioning... so best to use a cotton swab.  BTW, naphtha works as well, or
better than alcohol, but beware... naphtha is highly flammable.

I have been through this before. I bought around five new old stock 1541-II
drives from an old warehouse. So I say to myself...Ok, I can use one.

I pick one of these new disk drives and start to read some old floppies I
had for the past 20 years. Crunching, screeching and the drive doesn't read
anything anymore.

What it did happen was simple: pieces of the floppy's surface fell apart and
got stuck on the drive's head. When I did use a cleaning floppy, it was
clear the _new_ disk drive's head was dirty as hell. The white cleaning
floppy came out of the drive dirty, with pieces stuck on its surface.

So I think all you need is to clean the drive's head. The Best I remember,
the 1571 uses a track 0 sensor for its alignment, so alignment problems are
not as common as on the old 1541 drives; you can fix the stepper motor
rotation, but I don't think that's the problem.

Regarding the mismatch ID, what ROM revision are you currently using on the
drive? Maybe there's a possibility the ROM went partially bad.

I know such issues very well, since I'm also buying
Originals on eBay from time to time. Some of them are
in really bad conditions, like having mold on their
surfaces from (too much and wettish) basement storage.

Some disks also made these screeching/singing sounds,
when read with my 1571 disk drive. Some of the baddest
of the bad disks are losing their magnetic coating
while being read. That coating then accumulates on the
drive's head. This then leads to a defective drive
since it cannot read not write a disk error free if at
all. Further the disk being tested is destroyed,
because the accumulated coating on the head rubs away
some of the coating from the currently inserted disk.

The &quot;repair&quot; is easy, but time consuming sometimes.
Just clean the heads, so that the accumulated coating,
mold, dust or whatever is removed from the head. Since
this stuff can be very tenacious, you may need very
much trials.
I got several of these old cleaning diskettes along
with a tube of alcohol (isopropyl alcohol 100%).
First, I start with making the heads only &quot;wet&quot; with
the alcohol and let it permeate ino the dust. Then
I'm using the cleaning diskette, giving 5 tips of
alcohol onto its surface, inserting it and then
sending some commands to the drive, so that it starts
spinning. The cleaning diskette then scrubs over the
heads and hopefully will be able to remove all
superfluous stuff. I let the cleaning disk run over
30 seconds, sometimes a minute, if I'm fighting
against magnetic coating.

Awesome responses guys! Thank you! You guys nailed it, dirty head! I
opened her up today and cleaned the head with rubbing alcohol, bingo!
I just did some tests and it seems to be working just fine, including
formatting.

Next the disk ID mismatch issue. It seems write protect disable switch
is non-functional, it is disabled no matter what. There must be
something wrong with the mod. I'm gonna tear this apart and try to
determine why.

Thanks again.

Ok, looking at the disk ID mismatch issue some more. It seems like
only when WP switch is set to disable does mismatch show up. Now again
it seems like it may work for a while, but then it will start throwing
mismatch. However I think I found the cause. It appears I used a zener
diode and not a general purpose diode. Whoops! I bet that would do it!

I'll have to stop at rat shack on the way home tomorrow..
