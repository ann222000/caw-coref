Question About Slotting The Struts In Order to Get Wheels Aligned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The service center tells me that the wheel alignment on my 95 Cutlass
cannot be accomplished without slotting the struts. This is the first
time I've heard of this practice. Is it an accepatable method for
getting a car back in alignment? From what I was told, it is somewhat
common.

I was going to go ahead and have this done, but I've begun wondering
if a car that requires its struts to be slotted in order to acheive
alignment may have bigger issues than just an alignment issue.

Any information or recommendations would be appreciated.

My '01 Cavalier needed the strut slots elongated to get the
thing into line. The technician says that they often don't have enough
slot length. He also said, IIRC, that the aftermarket struts have
longer slots so that they can be aligned properly.
Sounds to me like GM struts don't have long enough slots, so
they just align them as close as the slot allows and kick them out of
the factory.

Thanks for the answers. I was told all four struts need to be slotted,
so I was concerned the car's frame should be worked on and not the
struts.

If it still have the original struts in it, then I would replace them
first.  Unless the car ahs really low miles, or something.

This only has an effect on camber -- by far the least important of the
wheel alignment angles.  If the original struts were not slotted and
camber is radically wrong then something is bent.

I am going to have a shop  that specializes in frames/alignments give
me an opinion on the condition of the frame, and if necessary, slot
the struts. They have not seen the car yet, but the person I spoke
with said slotting the struts is sometimes necesary and not indicative
of a bent undercarriage.

I can't see an automaker selling a car with parts that do not permit
the cars wheels to be aligned. To me the fact that slotting is
required to achieve alignment would mean that something is bent/
damaged, causing the suspension to be out of calibration range. But I
don't fix cars everyday, so that may not be the case in real life.

Everything is bent.  Life is like that.  Some things are bent a tiny
little bit and you don't have to worry about them.  Some things are bent
a whole lot and are a major problem.  The alignment guy's job is to
know the difference between the two.

Your local tire place has a kid who can put the car up on the machine,
look at the numbers the computer spits out, and make the adjustments the
computer tells him to make.  He probably doesn't have a good idea of what
he is doing or why, he just does what the computer tells him to do.  He
may even overlook problems that make the vehicle impossible to align,
because the computer doesn't know and nobody ever told him to look for them.

Unfortunately, there are few expert alignment guys out there these days.
But if you have a shop that can do it, take it there.  If they don't find
anything wrong, well, then you have made a good investment because now you
know there's nothing wrong.

If the &quot;AutoMaker&quot; slots the struts.....

then.....

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF EM ......has to be aligned
before they're shipped.  Think about it.

Then, when yer through crunchin the numbers on pay'n
folks what you have to pay folks to do what folks would
have to do cuz computers couldn't do it and how many
folks it would take to do the job that a computer couldn't
do, then.....go read Scott Dorseys reply to your post
and think about how shit is made to bend,warp,sag, and
droop after awhile.

(man.....can i make a runon sentence or what)

:)

Guess i cudda jest said that the automakers
save BILLIONS because they don't have to
align them at the factory.

anywhoooooo.......

Read what Scott wrote very carefully cuz he hit the
nail on the head........

and my &quot;guess&quot; would be that the spings, isolators and
the bearing plates have wear causing the vehical to sag,
which is causing the camber to be way off.

which brings to mind another thing, if you have time,
read the scathing i'm fixin to go give DON.....

who told you in open forum for all the world to see
for eternity......
(i do not quote....i copy and paster!!)

This only has an effect on camber -- by far the least important of
the
wheel alignment angles.

&lt;end copy and paste of BAD information&gt;

In closing, SOMEONE.....should have mentioned
that aftermarket replacement struts............
usually have the slots in em.    :)

Toe error destroys tires rapidly -- as little as 1/8&quot; error makes a
difference in tire wear.  Toe error also causes very disconcerting
handlindg as the tires constantly battle deach other for dominance
while pointed in didfferent directions.  That's why ALL vehicles have
adjustable toe on the front suspension, also on the rear unless solid
axle.

Caster causes pull.  Some vehicles have caster adjustments, some do
not.

I have seen many a vehicle with significant camber error and no tire
wear or apparent tire problems.  It has been tradionally taught that
camber causes pull towards the side with a more positive setting and
that camber error can wear tires on one side.  This was far more the
case with bias ply tires than with today's radials.  I have seen as
much as a 4* camber error with no apparent problems.  In fact I owned
a vehicle with that condition (due to a collision) for quite some
time.  I kept looking for &quot;camber wear&quot; or expecting pull and it just
didn't happen because caster and toe were good. Many vehicles have no
camber adjustment provided at the factory.

The engineers cannot foresee exactly what will happen to their designs once
they hit the streets.

Take the Chevy Vega......

The front end alignment adjustments were quite adequate on new Vegas.
One-or-two-year-old, low-mileage Vegas could be aligned quickly with the
eccentrics on the lower control arms.

After they had been on the street for a while, however, the forward frame
rails (stamped metal) twisted, and the whole front end sagged - to the
point that you could NOT get enough camber adjustment from them.

The twisted rails brought the upper control arm mounts inward - creating
excess negative camber. The camber adjjustment was on the lower control
arm, and at max, it could not compensate for the dis-located upper control
arm mounts.

We had to resort to pulling (twisting) the frame rail back into position -
thus moving the upper control arm mount back outwards - in order to get
enough adjustment to set the camber within specification.

I did so mnany that I had developed a block and chaimn that I would run up
through the shock tower and tie down to the rack. I would then jack the
frame rail and watch it twist back into position.

Some customers paid extra for me to fashion up a cross brace that went
from tower-to-tower in the engine compartment.

I have no doubt that your '01 Cavalier and the OP's '95 Cutlass are
suffering from similar, unpredictable chassis movement.

Some would say that twisting is only to be expected from stamped metal
unibody setups - a statement with which I would find it difficult to
disagree - but, most of the time engineering makes some sort of allowances
for this.

In some cases, such as the Vega, not enough allowance is made.

Toe is a tire wear angle

Camber is both a tire-wear AND directional-control angle.

&gt;Toe is a tire wear angle
">

And it is critical.  If wrong, the tires are each trying to go in a
different direction with disasterous results to stability and tire
wear.  That is why it is ALWAYS adjustable except on a solid rear
axle.  FWIW what some people would think is camber wear -- tire tread
worn on one side is usually actually toe wear.  What happens is the
tire is effectively dragged sideways some percentage of its forward
traveled distance and this pulls the sidewalls so the tire wears
unevenly side-to-side.   Obsolete text books which were written for
bias ply tires still call this camber wear and show pictures of
feathered tires for toe wear.  You rarely see feathered (I am not
referring to cupping) tires these days.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Caster is a directional-control angle
&gt;Camber is both a tire-wear AND directional-control angle.
">

Correct.  And it made a significant difference with bias ply tires.
The effects are very subtle with radial tires.  The flexible sidewalls
of radial tires absorb the camber error and the tread patch is hardly
affected.  I have seen many a vehicle where the suspension was not
fully repaired after a curb impact.  If only the camber is off spec
it's about impossible to tell.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Don  wrote:

&gt; &gt; &gt; This only has an effect on camber -- by far the least important of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wheel alignment angles. ?If the original struts were not slotted

&gt; &gt; Please observe stipulation &quot;IF THE ORIGINAL STRUTS WERE NOT
&gt; &gt; SLOTTED.....&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; and  camber is radically wrong then something is bent.

&gt; &gt; Correct.  If the factory saw no need to provide camber adjustment and
&gt; &gt; now it is way off, something is bent.  Or, I should have included,
&gt; &gt; ride height or other modifications have been made to the suspension.

&gt; &gt; &gt;======
&gt; &gt; &gt;======

&gt; &gt; &gt;So if ones pulling real bad to the left......
&gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;you adjust the toe......??

&gt; &gt; Rear toe or caster.  Rotate or substitute tires to check for tire
&gt; &gt; pull.

&gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;when that don't work...you look for something
&gt; &gt; &gt;bent??
&gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;If a vehicle comes in with radical (i love that word)...
&gt; &gt; &gt;tire wear due to camber...and i'm sure YOU can
&gt; &gt; &gt;differentiate camber wear from toe wear or wear due
&gt; &gt; &gt;to worn struts or bad shocks or .......fk it.....anywhooo.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;IF it came in with radical camber wear on the tires...

&gt; &gt; You won't see camber wear very often these days.

&gt; &gt; &gt;you autmatically look for something bent??
&gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;You're incorrect in advising this customer that
&gt; &gt; &gt;camber is least important alignment angle.

&gt; &gt; Toe error destroys tires rapidly -- as little as 1/8&quot; error makes a
&gt; &gt; difference in tire wear.  Toe error also causes very disconcerting
&gt; &gt; handlindg as the tires constantly battle deach other for dominance
&gt; &gt; while pointed in didfferent directions.  That's why ALL vehicles have
&gt; &gt; adjustable toe on the front suspension, also on the rear unless solid
&gt; &gt; axle.

&gt; &gt; Caster causes pull.  Some vehicles have caster adjustments, some do
&gt; &gt; not.

&gt; &gt; I have seen many a vehicle with significant camber error and no tire
&gt; &gt; wear or apparent tire problems.  It has been tradionally taught that
&gt; &gt; camber causes pull towards the side with a more positive setting and
&gt; &gt; that camber error can wear tires on one side.  This was far more the
&gt; &gt; case with bias ply tires than with today's radials.  I have seen as
&gt; &gt; much as a 4* camber error with no apparent problems.  In fact I owned
&gt; &gt; a vehicle with that condition (due to a collision) for quite some
&gt; &gt; time.  I kept looking for &quot;camber wear&quot; or expecting pull and it just
&gt; &gt; didn't happen because caster and toe were good. Many vehicles have no
&gt; &gt; camber adjustment provided at the factory.

&gt; &gt; &gt;You are also incorrect in advising this customer
&gt; &gt; &gt;that something IS bent if the camber is RADICALLY
&gt; &gt; &gt;wrong.

&gt; &gt; If the camber is so far off as to require slotting struts where the
&gt; &gt; factory did not provide camber adjustment something got bent.
&gt; &gt; OK...or the suspension has been altered.

&gt; &gt; Don www.donsautomotive.com

&gt; &gt; &gt;You are NO alignment technician if you actually
&gt; &gt; &gt;adhere to this train of thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt;NOTHING......has to be bent for camber to radically
&gt; &gt; &gt;off. (wrong..whatever)

&gt; &gt; &gt;ever.....watched the alignment angle WHILE.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;adjusting torsion bars???

&gt; &gt; I  certainly would agree that a radical deviation from stock ride
&gt; &gt; height will affect camber.
