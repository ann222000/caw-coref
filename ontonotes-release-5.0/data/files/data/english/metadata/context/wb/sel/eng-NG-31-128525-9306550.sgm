Volume 7.41 - Friday, October 12, 2007

from Senior Pastor Timothy G. Satryan
WILMINGTON first assembly of God

=================================
One day, little Billy was visiting his grandmother, and began to tell her
how everything was going wrong in his life. He was having problems at
school, he was fighting with his brother and sister, he felt like he was
coming down with the flu. on and on he described all his woes and problems.
All the while Billy complained, His grandmother was baking a cake.
Interrupting Billy, she asked him if he would like a snack, which, of
course, he did!

&quot;Here, have some cooking oil.&quot;

&quot;Yuck&quot; said Billy.

&quot;How about a couple raw eggs?&quot;

&quot;Gross, Grandma!&quot;

&quot;Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking soda?&quot;

&quot;Grandma, those are all yucky!&quot;

Billy's grandmother then said, &quot;Yes, all those things seem bad all by
themselves. But when they are put together in the right way, they make a
wonderfully delicious cake!

God works the same way. Many times we wonder why He would let us go through
such bad and difficult times. But God knows when He puts these things all in
His order, they always work for good! We just have to trust Him and,
eventually, they will all make something wonderful!
God is crazy about you! He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise
every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen. He can live anywhere
in the universe, and He chose your heart.

According to Romans 8:28, &quot;we know that in all things God works for the good
of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot; What
&quot;things&quot; are going on in your life now? Perhaps you can't see how all these
things could possibly work together for good. The ingredients just don't
seem all that wonderful right now.

Don't give up! In time, you will see how the Lord mixes all the ingredients
in your life in a wonderful way! Although today may not seem like a &quot;piece
of cake,&quot; as we allow the Lord to complete the work He has begun in us,
great things are sure to happen!

Here is your copy of firstIMPRESSIONS, Volume 7.41. Live for God, on
purpose, realizing that He is in control of all things in your life!

IDOLS OR IDEALS?
For some it's a place, while for others it's a passion. For some it's a
position, while for others it's a Person. For some it's an object, but for
others it's a direct connect! What are we talking about, you may be asking?
Why, worship, of course!

Created within the inner fiber of every human being ever to walk this
planet, there is a longing, a desire, an insatiable need to worship. It is
an itch that just must be scratched! But unfortunately, since the fall of
man, he has had a continual urge to replace the One who is worthy and
deserving of our worship, with one who has been self-created, and often
created in man's own image.

Some have chosen to worship trees, rocks, planets and stars. Some have
worshipped cows, dogs, poles and cars! Some have created their own &quot;god&quot; to
worship, while others have chosen to worship some nebulous unreal and unseen
force of a new age.

In spite of all these attempts - and perhaps because of them - our God has
given us His second great principle for living - &quot;you shall not make for
yourself an idol.&quot; Found in Exodus 20:4-6, this great command is actually
re-stated from a positive perspective in John 4:24, in which Jesus says &quot;God
is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot; The
question is whether we worship idols, or worship the Ideal!

Be sure to join us this Sunday, as we continue our series of messages on
&quot;The Ultimate Top Ten List - God's Top Ten Principles for Living&quot; with the
second principle - &quot;Worship God in Spirit and in Truth!&quot; Don't miss it!

=================================
HOW WILL THE CHURCH BE LIGHTED?
Several centuries ago in a mountain village in Europe, a wealthy nobleman
wondered what legacy he should leave to his townspeople. He made a good
decision. He decided to build them a church. No one was permitted to see the
plans or the inside of the church until it was finished. At its grand
opening, the people gathered and marveled at the beauty of the new church.
Everything had been thought of and included. It was a masterpiece.

But then someone said, &quot;Wait a minute! Where are the lamps? It is really
quite dark in here. How will the church be lighted?&quot; The nobleman pointed to
some brackets in the walls, and then he gave each family a lamp, which they
were to bring with them each time they came to worship.

&quot;Each time you are here&quot; the nobleman said, &quot;the place where you are seated
will be lighted. Each time you are not here, that place will be dark. This
is to remind you that whenever you fail to come to church, some part of
God's house will be dark&quot;

That's a poignant story, isn't it? And it makes a very significant point
about the importance of our commitment and loyalty to the church. The poet
Edward Everett Hale put it like this:

I am only one,
but still I am one.
I cannot do everything,
But still I can do something;
And because I cannot do everything
I will not refuse to do the something I can do.

What if every member of your church supported the church just as you do?
What kind of church would you have? What if every single member served the
church, attended the church, loved the church, shared the church, and gave
to the church exactly as you do? What kind of church would you be?

from James W. Moore's, &quot;Some things Are Too Good Not To Be True,&quot;
Dimensions: Nashville, 1994. pp. 117-118.

=================================
NO EXCUSE SUNDAY
To make it possible for everyone to attend church next Sunday, we are going
to have a special &quot;No Excuse Sunday&quot;.
.   Cots will be placed in the foyer for those who say, &quot;Sunday is my
only day to sleep in.&quot;
.   There will be a special section with lounge chairs who feel that our
pews are too hard.
.   Eye drops will be available for those with tired eyes from watching
T.V. late Saturday night.
.   We will have steel helmets for those who say &quot; The roof would cave
in if I ever came to church.&quot;
.   Blankets will be furnished for those who think the church is too
cold and fans for those who say it is too hot.
.   Score cards will be available for those who wish to list the
hypocrites present.
.   Relatives and friends will be in attendance for those who can't go
to church and cook dinner, too.
.   We will distribute &quot;Stamp Out Stewardship&quot; buttons for those who
feel that church is always asking for money.
.   One section will be devoted to trees and grass for those who like to
seek God in nature.
.   Doctors and nurses will be in attendance for those who plan to be
sick on Sunday.
.   The sanctuary will be decorated with both Christmas poinsettias and
Easter lilies for those who never have seen the church without them.
.   We will provide hearing aids for those who can't hear the preacher
and cotton for those who say he is too loud.

=================================
THREE SIMPLE STEPS TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN

DO IT. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale put it like this: &quot;Action is a great
restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the
cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps
different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is
better than no action at all.&quot; Do it.

DO IT RIGHT. One poet put it like this: &quot;If a task is once begun, never
leave until it's done. Be the labor great or small, do it well or not at
all.&quot; Do it right.

DO IT RIGHT NOW. In the Spanish-American War, as the American soldiers were
trying to capture San Juan Hill, they were thrown back again and again. The
black powder ammunition they were using pinpointed their position for their
enemies. As soldier after soldier toppled, the troops began to panic. Up
rode Teddy Roosevelt, on a little horse named &quot;Texas,&quot; urging his men on.
Encouraged by his bravery in exposing himself to the whizzing bullets, the
troops began to cheer their commander.

&quot;Don't cheer, men,&quot; Roosevelt called out to them. &quot;Fight! Now's the time to
fight!&quot;

There is a time to cheer. A time to reflect. A time to plan. A time to
reminisce. But there is also a time to act. Those who accomplish anything
worthwhile know that time is now.

Do it. Do it right. Do it right now. These are three simple steps to
success.

=================================
EXAMINE YOUR WAYS!

&quot;Let us examine our ways.&quot; - Lamentations 3:40 (NIV)

A man rushed into a service station one day and asked the manager if he had
a pay phone. The manager nodded, &quot;Sure, over there.&quot; The man inserted a
couple of coins, dialed and waited for an answer. Finally someone came on
the line. &quot;Uh, sir,&quot; he said in a deep voice, &quot;could you use an honest,
hard-working young man?&quot; The station manager couldn't help overhearing the
question. After a moment or two the man said, &quot;Oh, you already have an
honest, hard-working young man? Well, okay. Thanks all the same.&quot; A broad
smile stretched across his face.

He hung up the phone and started back to his car, obviously elated. &quot;Hey,
just a minute,&quot; the station manager said, &quot;I couldn't help but hear your
conversation. Why are you so happy? I thought the man said he already had
someone and didn't need you?&quot; The man smiled. &quot;Well, you see, I am that
honest, hard-working young man. I was just checking up on myself!&quot;

If you're serious about walking with God, examine yourself regularly. Are
you praying, reading God's Word and renewing your mind daily? How about your
attitudes? Are they slipping? Your attitudes send a signal before you've
said a word. They're like traffic lights. Sometimes they flash red, which
means 'stop, don't get in my way, I'm too busy to love, help, or care.'
Sometimes they flash yellow, which means 'I'm touchy and out-of-sorts, I
could go either way.' Sometimes they flash green, which means, 'it's go, I'm
with you, you can count on me.'

The Bible says, &quot;Let us examine our ways... and... return to the Lord.&quot; What
needs to be examined regularly? &quot;Our ways!&quot;

SUNKEN TREASURE
by David Jeremiah

&quot;If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures; then
you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.&quot; -
Proverbs 2:4-5

Newspapers are reporting that a shipwrecked Spanish galleon, the Capitana,
has been discovered off the coast of Ecuador and may contain a king's ransom
of wealth. It was heavily laden with silver coinage when it sunk in 1654.
Divers have been able to salvage some of the coins, but the bulk of the
booty remains submerged under several feet of mud near the mouth of
Ecuador's Guayaquil River. The boat was carrying 10 million pesos, and each
piece today could fetch from $100 to several thousand dollars.

Have you ever dreamed of discovering a sunken or buried treasure? Well, how
about searching the Scriptures for God's treasure? In Proverbs 2, the Lord
tells us to &quot;treasure my commands within you,&quot; and to &quot;incline your ear to
wisdom.&quot; We're to seek His wisdom &quot;as silver, and search for (it) as for
hidden treasures&quot; (verses 1-2, 4).

The Bible is a treasure chest of over 31,000 coins (verses); and in
discovering the truths of God, we'll enjoy the riches of wisdom.

&quot;Nobody ever outgrows Scripture: the Book widens and deepens with our
years.&quot; - Charles Spurgeon

from Dr. David Jeremiah's &quot;Today's Turning Point&quot; daily devotional of
October 2, 2007. www.TurningPointOnline.org

=================================
PATIENCE IN PRAYER
When the idea is not right, God says, &quot;NO.&quot;
No - when the idea is not the best.
No - when the idea is absolutely wrong.
No - when though it may help you, it would create problems for someone else.

When the time is not right, God says, &quot;SLOW.&quot;
What a catastrophe it would be if God answered every prayer at the snap of
your fingers.
Do you know what would happen?
God would become your servant, not your master.
Suddenly God would be working for you instead of you working for God.

When you are not right, God says, &quot;GROW.&quot;
The selfish person has to grow in unselfishness.
The cautious person must grow in courage.
The timid person must grow in confidence,
The dominating person must grow in sensitivity.
The critical person must grow in tolerance.
The negative person must grow in positive attitudes.
The pleasure seeking person must grow in compassion for suffering people.

When everything is all right, God says, &quot;GO.&quot;
Then miracles happen:
A hopeless alcoholic is set free.
A drug addict finds release.
A doubter becomes a child in his belief.
Diseased tissue responds to treatment, and healing begins.
The door to your dream suddenly swings open and there stands God saying,
&quot;GO!&quot;

Remember: God's delays are not God's denials.
God's timing is perfect.
Patience is what we need in prayer
