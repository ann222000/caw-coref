Anyone have one that is close and I could borrow it for a hole in my
aluminum bracket I am building for the car top antenna system?  3/4
would probably work as its for a coax connector on the mount I have.

Jay,

I have a 3/4&quot; punch somewhere but, I haven't used it for a couple of years and don't know where it is. I bought it to punch holes for coax connectors.

Also, I work in Ephrata during the week and am home (Nine Mile Falls) only on the weekends.

Let me know if you don't come up with something else and I will try to find it this weekend.

73,

I've got a set of Greenlee punches.  I can check the size of them, if you
can't find anything else.  You're welcome to borrow it.  It makes a perfect
hole (whereas a hole-saw leaves a mess behind).

Jay, I have a drill press and am almost certain I have a 5/8 drill bit. If
you want to go that route I will check this morning. Dan
