&gt; Hi there,

&gt; In case any of you missed it, Ed and I are having a discussion on what
&gt; would be the best tactics to use to end the flame war in here, which
&gt; is mainly centered around Ed and what I call his Fan Club!

&gt; I say that the flame war would *eventually* (I think it would take
&gt; quite some time) end if Ed no longer responded to flames and posted
&gt; astrology only.

&gt; He doesn't think that would work because even in the periods where he
&gt; has stopped posting altogether (which I do not say he should do), the
&gt; flames have continued.

&gt; I believe that, once again, it would take a lot more time than he has
&gt; given it.

&gt; He seems to be saying (if I misinterpret him, my apologies in advance)
&gt; that it would be better if those astrologers who remain in this group
&gt; were to join his fight against the people flaming him.

&gt; I think that this would just give the flamers more posts to flame.

&gt; This is simply a difference of opinion on tactics, and I think we are
&gt; all entitled to our opinions.

&gt; But I'm curious to see what the actual participants will say, if any
&gt; of you are willing to be honest about what would actually stop you, at
&gt; any point in time, from flaming Ed Wollmann.

&gt; So what say you?  I'm curious :)
">

I will stop flaming Wollmann when he stops saying ridiculous shit, stops
lying, apologizes to you, posts proof of all of his alleged Degrees to
the Web, admits he's been an abuser, admits when he's wrong, apologizes
for killing that teenage boy, pays back Susan, stops referring to Kepler
as a "University", matures to the point where he can actually tolerate a
difference of opinion rather than demand agreement or insist on his
superiority, meets me and Dan at PF Changs, admits that the idea to
"CRUSH spinics" is a lame one, and admits that he will never, ever be
filing any lawsuits.

Pretty simple, really, although he's absolutely incapable of even
performing one of those duties!

Edmo opened a can of worms by daring others to expose him for the fraud
he is. That said, he's fucked if he thinks anyone who has seen him go RL
on someone is going to forget that anytime soon.

Added to that are some questionable tactics and the fact that when
they're thrown back into his face makes him froth and foam. There's a
damned good reason he's won a load of kook awards, he's a fucking kook.

His plagiarism, his own words and that terrible book have ruined his
reputation far more than anyone else could hope to.

At this point he's no more than entertainment. Even if he never answers
anyone again and simply posts he's screwed since someone will call him on
his lies, claims and assorted bullshit. His best bet is to accept the
spanking, find another way to troll for rubes and (finally) leave.

Like that's gonna happen. The problem is that Edmo is the yardstick that
other kooks are measured against and this group attracts them because of
him.

Of course, he could always become a decent human being, and that would
probably go a long way. He would still have to deal with what he's got
coming, but after a while, it would become obvious that he was no longer
such an asshole. At the very least, he would not be inspiring further
derision and hatred, especially if he made it clear that he realized what
a dick he's been, and apologized to people he's offended in one way or
another. If he actually focused on the give and take of real
relationships, if he stopped bullying women in general and everyone who
disagrees with him, and learned that he is not the center of the
universe...

I see you start YET ANOTHER Wollmann flamethread so that we have even
more off topic non-sense in this group. Facts are terrible things
aren't they? I posted the monthly and all time top abusers for the
group as of 2/24/05--my name is never in any one of those statistics,
so the facts speak for themselves that you once again are proven the
liar, because if I was ANSWERING the flames my post count would be in
the same numbers--even more than the abusers, but it isn't.
For the final time, unless one is completely blind they can see the
only ones I answer are those I believe MIGHT have something to do with
astrology in this group--except for these ones where I have been
talking to you. I made the error of talking to you in the past and
believing you might be sincere. I should have remembered that I found
your same whines in the archives that you post periodically and that
your sincereity was in question, especially after I gave you free
advice in an email once that was unappreciated and forgotten.
I will not make that mistake again. I charge $100 an hour for
consultations, if you need astrological guidance you can request an
appointment with me. Like it or not folks, I counsel professionals and
have never had a complaint that the $100 an hour was not worth it in
the 26 years I have been doing counseling with astrology.
Otherwise, good luck with your trolling, which really all that goes on
here. When I don't reply the trolls take things out of context from my
posts and start their own threads with it--or--if they really get bored
start flaming each other. I will be here at least another 40 years and
my approach to the abuse will remain the same, and the flamers can
waste the rest of their time on Earth thinking that calling me silly
names is somehow worthwhile or effective in some warped way--their
defective thinking problem not mine. The archives will be filled and
refined with my posts and information as long as the potential to do so
survives.

&gt;&gt;&gt; His plagiarism, his own words and that terrible book have ruined his
&gt;&gt;&gt; reputation far more than anyone else could hope to.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At this point he's no more than entertainment. Even if he never
&gt;&gt;&gt; answers anyone again and simply posts he's screwed since someone
&gt;&gt;&gt; will call him on his lies, claims and assorted bullshit. His best
&gt;&gt;&gt; bet is to accept the spanking, find another way to troll for rubes
&gt;&gt;&gt; and (finally) leave.

&gt;&gt;Of course, he could always become a decent human being, and that would
&gt;&gt;probably go a long way. He would still have to deal with what he's got
&gt;&gt;coming, but after a while, it would become obvious that he was no
&gt;&gt;longer such an asshole. At the very least, he would not be inspiring
&gt;&gt;further derision and hatred, especially if he made it clear that he
&gt;&gt;realized what a dick he's been, and apologized to people he's offended
&gt;&gt;in one way or another. If he actually focused on the give and take of
&gt;&gt;real relationships, if he stopped bullying women in general and
&gt;&gt;everyone who disagrees with him, and learned that he is not the center
&gt;&gt;of the universe...

Actually defending his writings would be ok. It's his

&gt;&gt;&gt;is mainly centered around Ed and what I call his Fan Club!

Good question! Even more to the point, why did he create that reality?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I say that the flame war would *eventually* (I think it would take

&gt;&gt;I see you start YET ANOTHER Wollmann flamethread so that we have even
&gt;&gt;more off topic non-sense in this group.

&gt; I didn't ask for it to become a flame thread.  I did ask a question,

&gt;&gt;start flaming each other. I will be here at least another 40 years and

&gt;&gt;waste the rest of their time on Earth thinking that calling me silly

You mean you don't consider yourself an abuser? Who'd have

Eddy, you are the all time top abuser of alt.astrology.
Nobody else has come close to your spamming, whining, crying,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;made it clear that he realized what a dick he's been, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;apologized to people he's offended in one way or another. If he

Honey I am most sincerely not flattering you.  I am trying to
express the truth as I see it.  You ARE like the old man on the
mountain in the newsgroup because your logic is flawless, you do not
contradict yourself and your writing is sooo beautiful, it is rather
'old-worldly' and very elegant.  I can also clearly see that some are
threatened by this and will try to 'pit' themselves against your
authority and take you on over little things.  As you state, it is
impotent; as I see it, they are lucky you bother to answer..remember,
that I am very perceptive and sensitive to the tone of these
posts..and, as you have stated, can see the forest through the trees.
I say it really reduces to well, jealousy.

If you would let me, I would take these people on myself; it
alternately amuses me and irritates me to read their questions
sometimes.  They are just clatter and din in the background....

&gt;9 years is long enough for you fools to see yourselves. I will not be

If that were actually true, you'd stop sending complaints,

That your business has been slandered and adversely affected
by things posted here?

&gt;How does one underestimate a nothing? There is nothing important here.
&gt;I am not here for you all, you all think you know everything already, I

You've already multi-posted all 15 of your essays, and the
odd supportive emails. What's left to archive?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; &gt;of you are willing to be honest about what would actually stop you, at
&gt;&gt; &gt;any point in time, from flaming Ed Wollmann.

&gt;She asks abusers if they think thier abuse is my fault or theirs!!
&gt;Bwahahahahahahahahaha!!! Why don't you ask the fox if he should advise
&gt;on how to run the henhouse?

Most of the major combatants here have offered to stop, and
you rejected them every time. Looks like you're after
revenge to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;So what say you?  I'm curious :)

&gt;&gt; I think he needs to stop doing the things that create flames.

&gt;All I have ever done is post my work, discuss astrology, psychology and
&gt;metaphysics for free to an ungrateful audience, complain properly for
&gt;spam and off topic harassment (the thing every ISP warns against doing)
&gt;and discuss astrology, psychology and philosophy with those who are so
&gt;willing.
">

That wildly understates your actions, especially the
"complain properly..." part. In fact, those acts were the
inspiration for www.smbtech.com/ed . And the posts archived
there show your paragraph above to be a serious lie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The rest of you and your instigation of dissent and conflict
&gt;are irrelevant in the scheme of things.
&gt;But then, you are a coward, like Pam, so you will never taste anything

You don't know any more about my life now than you did 10
paragraphs earlier.

No.

I asked what, if anything (and at this point I'm not so sure there IS
anything), would bring about a cease-fire on their side in the flame
war involving you.

I asked because I wanted to know, as the flame war has taken up so
much time and enery and sheer space in this group.

I have no idea where you got "my fault or theirs" out of what I asked
in this thread.

Perhaps we do not see each other clearly.  I do not have my charts in
front of me at the moment, but I seem to remember that  your Neptune
is conjunct my Sun, and my Neptune is in opposition to your Sun.

Anyway, good luck with ending the flame war, however you choose to
bring that about.  I would stop it if I could, but this is not within
my power, as I am not Goddess of Usenet.

I know what it doesn't constitute, Ed: any ability to create it, the way
you say you can. For years, you've been lying about being able to create
your own reality, when in fact you show quite powerfully how you are
unable to even modify yours a tiny bit, hence the thousands of useless,
pointless complaints, and the hundreds of empty lawsuit threats you've made.

You are lying again. Not only are you not educationally, professionally,
or ethically equipped to counsel, you are also unlicensed to do so.
You do not hold adequate degrees for counsel. It is illegal for you to
promote yourself as a counselor. Also, you obviously cannot count. Two
days ago you were claiing 26 years of counsel.If you can't do that
simple math, you aren't intelligent enough to counsel, either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Oh, let's hear all about that family. You HAVE no family. It is BROKEN.
You divorced your wife years ago, and your relationship with your
ex-wife and son is not healthy. You point to "rasising a faimly" as an
example of your happiness? That's pretty pathetic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Some of them actually not bad, but most horribly ugly, or worse, some of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;owning hundreds of acres

That is no big accomplishment. So what? Anyone can buy dirt-cheap land
in New Mexico. And you certainly don't own hundreds of acres now. You're
dishonestly tring to make it seem like you own that now, when in fact
the truth is you mean you've owned and sold these acres in the past.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and millions of dollars in real
&gt; estate,

Once again, you're trying to bring your trading in real estate over
several years to make it seem like you have those millions of dollars
*now*. You don't. Knowing your penchant for exaggeration and your habit
of pathological lying, it's safe to assume you never did, all at one time.

But again, this doesn't convince anyone you're happy.

Just the other day, you were complaining about money being the factor
that keeps you from filing those lawsuits you're been threatening for 9
years. If you were happy, you wouldn't be threratening the lawsuits and
complaining. If you had millions of dollars in real estate, you'd be
able to afford the lawsuits.

If you could create your own reality, you wouldn't be responding to me now.

Your fantasy life. You are clearly deluded beyond all hope.

Note that you did not even address whether or not you are happy. You
simply lied about a laundry list of things, most of them regarding
material wealth. If you had said something along the lines of "Of course
I'm happy. I went to my girlfriend's daughter's birthday party the other
day, and had the most wonderful time watching them play. It's amazing,
seeing the bond between them", that might imply some humanity, some
happiness. But you don't write things like that because you are a
sociopath.

Note that you completely avoided the original concept of you failing to
be able to create your reality.

You've got this new martyr complex thing going. You're trying to act as
if you're pure as the driven snow, and completely denying the last 9
years in which you have been the most abusive, censorial, scumbag
asshole on Usenet.

Ed Wollman is a remorseless admitted killer of a teenage boy. He is a

the private mail of a former lover who has nothing to do with anything
here. He recently stated that if 12 year old girls get raped, they
either chose for it to happen or were "born into it". He is a sociopath
who tries to censor his critics. He is frequently incoherent and
abusive. He has lost 20 ISP accounts for spamming and abuse.

At his *best*, he is an entertaining fool. His theories about dinosaur
size/gravity and Moon formation are high crackpot comedy. He is a foul
misogynist who in the past week berated and insulted Beep over and over
again for absolutely no good reason.

Right, after insulting everyone who puts Ed in their place, by
generalizing and assuming they all have massive psychological or
substance-abuse problems. In other words, you're talking out of your ass
after openly admitting you haven't seen much.

You "hadn't planned on getting involved in this particular conflict."

You sure don't plan very well.

RM: I didn't see the original post from Petrus on alt.astrology, but I
have to say how pleased I am to see another astrologer with the guts
to put forward a reasonable interpretation of the events relating to
Professional Astrologer Ed Wollmann on usenet.

For what it's worth, I cannot recall ever complimenting ONE astrologer
(or astrology dabbler) doing the right thing in relation to the years
of harrassment (or persecution?) of Ed.

I've said before that Ed Wollmann and I are not on the same wavelength
about astrology in some respects, but he DOES know astrology better
than most - and certainly a lot more than I do; and he must not be
harrassed when posting astrological articles - even if his detractors
ARE mentally disturbed or lonely.

the San Diego Courthouse.

There's tangible, clear cut evidnce that proves what I am saying is

Please catalog the following statements :

&lt;clears throat&gt;

Ed is a liar, cheat, thief, remorseless killer of a teenage boy,
misogynist, plagiarist, would-be con man, operator of an illegal
"counseling" practice, dead beat, dumpster diving, impotent, flaccid,
narcissistic, obsessive-complusive, decayed, uneducated, uneducable,
spamming, duplicitous malignant ass chancre who ought to have been a
blow job.

His art is worse than childish, his lies are more than transparent, and
he lacks the man-fruits to *EVER* follow through on any of his too-vast
to catalogue (yet universally hilarious) threats at legal action. He is
now, was, and ever shall be a failure at everything he assays, unless he
decides to pay off some of his karmic debt and either deep throat a
loaded Remington 870 or climb into a nice warm bath with a sharp razor
(down, not across, Edmo).

If he were to be anything other than he is, he could not help but be
better. His only two saving graces are that he provides so many people
with roughly four times the USRDA of laughter at the expense of a
dim-witted fuckhead (himself), and that he's advanced in years enough
that he shan't be expelling his bilious terminations into our collective
atmosphere for all that much longer.

Will I be fined for any of the above some time this century, or will you
just be fucking off, you obtrusive, deliberately ignorant, toadying
roo-fucker?

Fuck off, Ray.

I never do that. He creates his own reality in which he is annoyed, or
