Blairs legacy

BLAIR like many of his fellow lawyers puts on the same airs and graces
of the pin strip suit  brigade and the robes and regalia mobsters,if
they LOOK clean and tidy they must be acting the same way.However
Blair has an extra special quality and that he looks like butter
wouldn't melt in his mouth yet behind the facade is one of the most
EVIL prime ministers Britain has ever seen .

It is hard to find a comparison with Thatcher as she LOOKED like the
devil reincarnated and had all the aggressive tendencies of an over
inflated ego and megalomania.But Blair  belies a devil worshipper in
disguise that is actually much worse than Thatcher .At least she
didn't hide her personna behind a cloak as Blair does,he is the
ultimate wolf in sheeps clothing.

He has blood on his hands like no prime minister before that started
as soon as he appeased godfather Bush and his master plan for the New
World Order.Both of them attempt to portray some sort of worldy
goodness that will be created  from the ashes of Iraq,Afghanistan and
the other countries destroyed by the bully boy USA.But it also sends a
sinister message to anyone in their cosy little world that hasn't yet
been touched by the evil legal and political systems operating in the
UK and USA.

War is a great way to distract the masses while they bring in their
master plans in their homeland security networks with endless arrays
of electronic gadgetry to monitor us all from cradle to grave.

Bush and Blair are the masonic controllers of the illuminati
masters.Blairs obsessive control using cameras on every street corner
except in the star chamber civil/family courts where massive land and
property theft goes on unabated and unreported.

An I.D. system that will make Hitlers pale by comparison with new
biometric technology.The worry is that the new(old) etonian
Cameron ,promoted by the media ,is exactly the same .He has a sugary
sweet facade hiding his well heeled ETONIAN background that has always
protected the old boys network and will continue to do so much harm to
the ordinary British public.

It also promotes the royalists who continue to dominate the secret
society networks that control the unaccountable shadow government.
They have far greater power than the so called democracy the British
public have been fooled into accepting for so long as a way for us all
to  vote good people into office,that is so far from the truth.

It would take a microscope to find any good in the political donkeys
being put forward for us to vote for time and again by our anti
democratic press and tv.They give us little choice that might have
ensured someone with the political will,intellect and without Blairs
greedy aspirations and who could create not only a free society  but
also a FAIR society  catering for the masses as a whole .Not just the
rich donors of the political parties who undermine Britains need for a
truly democratic process.

Britain needs a complete overhaul of its legal,judicial and political
systems before ANY good will come from our fraudulent and rigged
election system.

The price of this corruption may be years in opposition

Whatever the outcome of the police investigation, Blair's legacy will
be deeply tainted - and the party may yet implode

The smell from No 10 increasingly resembles a stench. No one knows
whether the cash-for-honours affair will end up with charges, and of
what kind, or a decision by the police not to proceed. But even if it
is the latter, the stain will remain; the overriding feeling that Tony
Blair's premiership was tainted with wrongdoing will persist. It will
be like Harold Wilson's lavender list, but far, far worse: the whiff
of corruption will be manifest, even if the police can't make charges
stick. The chances of any Brown administration lasting very long now
surely look even slimmer. The legacy of New Labour, already damaged
beyond redemption by the debacle in Iraq, threatens to be defined by
malpractice and malfeasance.

We should not be too surprised. There has always been something less
than wholesome about New Labour. But Blair for a long time had an easy
ride. There was the whopping majority. There was the relief that the
Tories were finally gone. There was the grand hyperbole. There was the
fact that here was a leader (the first) who was a product of the new
educated middle classes and who spoke their language, a modern man no
less. There was his militant rejection of all that old cobblers about
socialism, ideology and old Labour (by which, of course, he meant the
Labour party). There was the fact that he was reassuring, that he
believed in the legacy of Thatcherism, that he was never going to
threaten the established order. During those rose-tinted years, what
passed for analysis of the New Labour phenomenon rarely rose about
tree-level.

But from its inception, New Labour contained within it what were
profoundly corrosive tendencies. Blair's election as leader was a coup
d'etat conducted with the connivance of the Labour party against
itself. The party had lost all self-belief and conviction: it was
anybody's. Blair was neither one of them nor part of it. His was an
alien body in a party demoralised by defeat. The anomalous nature of
Blair's position was celebrated by most of the media: but it contained
the seeds of disaster. The party felt utterly dependent on him,
prepared to do his bidding whatever that might be, while he felt no
sense of accountability whatsoever towards it. The party was his
punchbag. He was a free agent.

Then there was New Labour in office. From the outset, it invested an
extraordinary importance in the media and in the consequent need to
control the news agenda. Advisers - which almost invariably meant
spinmeisters - were liberally dispersed around the ministries. The
civil service, another potential check on overweaning government
power, found itself relegated and demeaned by Blair's political
appointees. Figures such as Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell,
masters of the dark arts, emerged as decisive figures within New
Labour. The message was everything, substance a pliant handmaiden,
truth the first casualty. Spin, of course, held the people in
contempt. If the media could be squared, then so could the public. It
was the antithesis of accountability. New Labour was, from the
beginning, a control freak. It was true of Blair, as it was true of
most of his acolytes and advisers: that was the way they did politics.
It all stemmed from a hugely exaggerated belief in the power of the
media, in the idea that controlling the media agenda would deliver the
country.

Blair, as a political leader, and as a product of the media age and
post-60s confessional honesty, traded in trust. He told it like it
was, he was one of us, he could be trusted. But trust in the hands of
a politician is a double-edged sword. There is a suggestion of
affinity, but also the implication that things could safely be left in
his hands, that we should not concern ourselves unduly, that we should
leave things to him. Blair's notion of trust is a bespoke product of
the era of personal politics, where a sense of emotional authenticity
has supplanted older notions of ideology and political principle.
Accountability depended on trust rather than policy, on style rather
than content. This was the Blair appeal: but in time its vacuous and
implicitly authoritarian character came to be exposed, most brutally
in his contempt for the public over Iraq. By trust, Blair meant
personal empathy, but in practice this was merely a cloak for
accentuating his own power: paradoxically, trust implied a growing
loss of unaccountability.

Blair is not a loose cannon. His political course has been more or
less entirely predictable. He has been a loyal proponent of the
neoliberal agenda and a slavish supporter of the US, whatever the hue
of the president. What could be more conventional than that? But his
style of political leadership has been highly unusual. He has
consistently turned on the party that he led, often displaying
antagonism bordering on contempt. He has been consumed by a desire to
be apart from it, and to be in no way constrained by it. And this
served to nurture a lack of accountability, a belief that he could do
whatever he wanted. The same went for his relationship with the civil
service and the use of his spinmeisters as a praetorian red guard.
And, ultimately, it was also true of his relationship with the public.
His contempt for them was evident in his belief in the all-consuming
power of the media and his own ability to control it. Control freaks
never trust the people, nor do they feel properly accountable to them.

Seen in this light, the latest turn of events that has led to more
than 90 people being questioned by the police, four of them while
under arrest, is not entirely surprising. Blair believed that he could
play fast and loose with the Labour party (he didn't even bother
telling its treasurer about the loans) and - to the party's eternal
shame - has got away with it (with barely a whimper of opposition even
on Iraq). He believed that he could control the media by playing fast
and loose with the truth through spin, and managed to get away with
that, at least until some point in his second term. And it would
appear that No 10 believed that it could somehow replenish the party's
coffers to fight the last general election by playing fast and loose
with the law. It may still get away with whatever it did, but in the
mind of the public it will be forever condemned as guilty. There was
always something rotten at the heart of New Labour: the police
investigation marks the moment of its recognition. It is a sad comment
that so many people were taken in by New Labour for so long. And the
price? The party could yet implode and find itself condemned to
opposition for many years to come.
