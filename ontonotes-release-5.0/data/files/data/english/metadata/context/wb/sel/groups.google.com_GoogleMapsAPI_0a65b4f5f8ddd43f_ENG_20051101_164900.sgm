I'm aware of the excellent mapki and kylemulka pages about using your
own maps, and am building up strength to tackle the project. Just
wondering if anyone out there has already used marine charts in a
google map app?

John,

Just beware that using a copyrighted map on the internet could spell
trouble for you. Be sure of your source, and best thing to do is ask
for permission. You probably won't get it, but if you don't ask, you
will certainly bring down their wrath.

John, really nice job there on your site. Love your boat... even
though I'm a lifelong sailor and never considered a &quot;stinkpot&quot;, the
olde Chris Crafts are simply lovely... and I'm getting olde too.
Wonderful photos, and I wish you luck.

John, thanks for the reminder, and of course you're right. The old
adage of &quot;better to ask forgiveness than permission&quot; probably wouldn't
work that well in this instance.

And Lupa, thanks for the comments on the site. It was a wonderful
trip, and the google map is a perfect way for others to travel along.

Hi John,

If I'm not mistaken nautical charts are copyright free, being compiled
with data from many sources expressly for public use. A couple of
years ago I inquired with NOAA about a project I was working on, using
nautical chart data, and was informed there was no problem at
all.( ) Checking my own NOAA and CHS(Canadian)
charts I find all manner of notes and publication data, but no
copyright notice.

Nice work on your integration of Google Maps API in the documentation
of your trip. I am working on a similar but less extensive use to
illustrate a trip my wife and I took from Scappoose, Oregon to Barkley
Sound, Vancouver Island, BC in Sept. Your site has given me some
ideas, such as using an xml include file for a lot of the data. See
my effort up to this point at:

After plotting all my GPoints for the track line in MAP mode, I now
discover it runs over land at some points in the satellite view. I
guess I'll reset all the points to be correct in the satellite view.

Regards,
J. Cody Couch

hmmm....good tip jcody.
I got curious...from the NOAA site:

Copying, reproduction of the NOAA ENC®s to any other server or
location for further reproduction or redistribution is discouraged
unless the following guidelines are followed: 1) the NOAA ENC®s and
supplementary files including the CATALOG.031 and README.TXT are
included in their entirety, 2) this disclaimer is displayed to and
accepted by anyone who accesses the NOAA ENC®s, and 3) a reference to
this Web site is included so that anyone accessing the NOAA ENC®s is
advised of where they originated.

If these NOAA ENC®s are incorporated into any other product in a form
other than as provided by NOAA, the producer of that product assumes
full liability and must adhere to conditions 2 and 3 described in the
paragraph above concerning copying or reproduction.

---

sounds like one could use these...a good resource to know about.

Jcody,
Nice job yourself on your Barkley Sound trip. Made me want to get going
again. Did you plot your lines directly from the GPS log files? I
parsed our log file to reduce the points down to where they would load,
which resulted in some shortcuts across land, but I ran out of energy
to fine-tune the parsing algorithm.

The copyright situation is different in Canada, where CHS licenses
vendors for various types of electronic charts. This has been a
prickly issue in Canada, resulting in long delays for vector charts
among other issues. Having said that, I haven't actually researched it
very far, nor have I approached NDI (the vendor who digitized the
charts I use in my old Navtrek97 software).

Within a few days of Google indexing our site, I got an email from CHS
regarding the &quot;charting error&quot; I talked about in
, and they
colloborated with NDI in researching my &quot;error&quot;, giving me a very
thorough reply. No mention was made of my using screen shots of their
charts in the web page.

This brings up another point - does using a Google map make your site
more attractive to Google indexing? Our site had been online for 6
months or more without appearing in Google searches. After I
registered for a key and put the map up, we were indexed in a few days.
I think I might start a new thread on this topic, since this one is
old now.

John
