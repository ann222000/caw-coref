Embrace the Four Fundamental Truths of Communication
Copyright Â© 2005 Mark Susnow
Inspire Possibility
http://www.inspirepossibility.com/

You're on the way to the airport. You get on the plane with a
book that you've been planning to read for quite some time. As
you open your book, you glance at the person next to you. A few
minutes later you are asked a question and you reluctantly
answer. You lower your book a bit to be polite and after a few
minutes you find yourself putting your book down and engaging in
a conversation, although with a lack of enthusiasm. And then the
person next to you, let's call him John, makes an observation
about you that's quite perceptive and sensitive. You start to
become curious about who John is and in the course of the
conversation, he tells you of an experience he has only shared
with a few people. You let John know that you have had the same
experience. By now you're totally engaged and listening to every
word he says. You notice every nuance in the inflection of his
voice and the way he moves. Time seems to stand still and the
next thing you know the plane lands. You say goodbye to the
kindred soul you have just met.

Wouldn't you love to have these experiences more often? You feel
heard and everything seems possible. It is communication at its
highest level and it's a lost art. You can have these experiences
more often if you embrace the four fundamental truths of
communication.

The first truth is to know that what we all want on a deeper
level is the ability to connect with another, to touch each
other's soul. Unfortunately, too many of our conversations are
just an exchange of ideas and information and we rarely penetrate
the surface. Most of our focus is on how we are going to respond
to what is being said instead of listening. When we know that
what the other person really wants is connection, there is common
ground to build upon. With this foundation, we can build
relationships that deepen and empower those involved.

The second truth is to know that listening involves much more
than just listening to words. It is tuning into the energy beyond
the words. It is understanding the needs and feelings of the
other person. It is about being totally engaged and at the same
time being in the rhythm of life. Yes, it takes a lot of energy
but you will be energized by what you get back. Imagine living in
a world where you are truly listening and fully engaged.

The third truth is to know that you must take responsibility for
the quality of your communication. Because we all have long
standing attitudes and beliefs we sometimes find ourselves trying
to convince the other person of our viewpoints. Being right then
becomes the goal of the interaction rather than communication and
the next thing you know you are in a full-fledged argument. Just
think of what happens when you discuss politics or religion. Is
being right more important than experiencing one of those magical
moments?

The fourth truth is that communication is a process and an art.
Being a masterful communicator doesn't happen over night but it
starts with the intention to experience more connection in your
busy life. Just like other art forms, i.e. dancing or music,
their is a natural ebb and flow in the learning cycle. As your
commitment deepens you notice that you are having frequent
glimpses of the magic that is possible in your life. The ultimate
communication occurs when you are able to touch anothers soul and
share who you are. This new-found magic then becomes the gateway
to a more fulfilling life.

At our core level we all have the same human needs and desires.
We want to know that we matter and that our life has meaning and
purpose. We also have the need to love and to be loved. When we
accept and recognize that we all have these same basic human
needs and desires we realize that we are part of one human
family. When we work together as one, what is possible in our
lives, communities, and the world expands.

Embracing the 4 fundamental truths of communication and applying
them to your daily life is a gift to all involved. As a way of
reaching out to others and connecting with them please share this
letter with the friends in your circle and let them know about
the advantages of being on the journey. Part of my journey has
been listening and learning from all the teachers who bless my
life. Your suggestions and comments contribute to my learning and
help me expand and evolve. Keep them flowing.
