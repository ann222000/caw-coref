The only problem, Ken, is that I wasn't harboring any grudges against anyone
in this group and still don't, but many chose to take offense that I made a
decision to try to live closer to my God and what He wants me to be.

So who is it , really, that needs to let bygones be bygones?

I and most others here don't care how you want to live your life.  But
you take offense at their ways the same way you accuse them of.  Thats
why religion shouldn't be discussed in NG's!!  Everyone has their own

No, Ken, I meant it as I wrote it, word for word.

One person has the gumption to not hide his beliefs and some take offense,
the old " I liked you better before" stuff.

There's no need for discussion. I believe as I choose. I post as those
beliefs constrain me to: if no religious content required, none posted; if
required, it will be in the post.

The discussion a few months back, and other times, off and on, you had with
Miles about limiting the income for business owners and, inclusively, CEO's.

The point is, Tom, as Miles tried to tell you, this is a free enterprise,
free market society and it is by majority rule ( what about 80% in favor of
no limitations).

In this country, you are in the minority in this attitude and will probably
never see those limits in place. No need to discuss it as it was just for
your information.

Just thought you'd find it interesting to read and it kinda proves you're
wrong about how I feel towards you, doesn't it?  :)

So, how long have you had trouble with reading and comprehension, not to
mention the cognizance of elapsed time periods?

I said that my wife helped me find my Savior nearly THIRTY years ago, John,
and that RECENTLY I decided to turn all my life over to Him instead of
holding back like so many do.

Do try to remember it this time.

I take that to mean that you /do/ agree that one person has no more right to

I didn't ask you about teaching any truths, but I don't think that's what

Budd, I have to step in here (again) in hopes of being the voice of reason.

This may be who you are and who you will be from now on and I am know that
most in here could care less about it.

I also know that Tom is right on this one.  The one thing that you fail to
see, realize and understand is that no one gives a damn about the "who you
are" they have only asked (repeatedly) that you stop ramming your religions
beliefs on everyone else in the group.

I hate to say, but by asking you to stop doing that is not a violation of
any law or constitutional freedom.  However, though it does not break a law
(that I know of) you are wrong to continue to force them on people who have
asked you time and time again to stop.

Why most you insist on trying to convert everyone to your beliefs, because
that is what it strongly appears that you are trying to do.  You have even
gone so far in the past as to tell miles (IIRC) that he was going to burn in
hell because he did not follow your path of beliefs.

Look at it this way if it helps you see.  In the military I know you had
some form of EO training, right?  In that training, did they not teach you
that if even ONE, 1, UNO, person complained, (to you or someone else) about
something that was said or done, then you as the person who did/said it, are
wrong and any further such incidents will be ceased.

Well, this really is no different.  No one here has ever said you are not
free to worship as you please or to follow the religious path you choose.
BUT we here are not you, nor do we desire to follow the same path as you, so
why can't you just post reference to the subject, WITH OUT all the religious
stuff with it?  I know you can, you know you can.

So if you enjoy dishing it out because it's what God tells you to do
then why are you complaining about anyone you gives it back?  If you
dish it out then expect it back.

Why do religious people seem to think they can win people over to their
beliefs by such methods?  There are better ways to achieve your goals.
Far better ways.  What you are doing is shoving people further away, not
drawing them in.  Something I doubt you nor many other religious people
will ever understand.  You are a classic example of why religion is
crumbling in this world.

No. Believing the sky is green because 2 or more say it is green doesn't

Only that there is more evidence for the accuracy, and in kind, the truth,

Budd, I never thought it would come to this, but you are the biggest
hypocritical ass I have had the displeasure of knowing.  I am not following
anyone, I am being myself.  Difference between me and you is that I am not
so stupidly blinded by some religious beliefs, that I can't see the light of
day.

You keep preaching and preaching and flat out REFUSE to see that you are
being an ass.  You are WRONG Budd, you have been ASKED to stop and you
refuse to.  You are FORCING YOUR BELIEFS on people who DO NOT WANT THEM!
WTF is so hard to under stand?

I have even told you that I am not interested in hearing your religious
banter but you keep going.  You need help.

&gt;&gt; Budd, I have to step in here (again) in hopes of being the voice of
&gt;&gt; reason.

&gt;&gt; This may be who you are and who you will be from now on and I am know
&gt;&gt; that most in here could care less about it.

&gt; That doesn't bother me. A true friend would not be bother by a change I
&gt; make in my life for the better but would rather support it.

&gt;&gt; I also know that Tom is right on this one.  The one thing that you fail
&gt;&gt; to see, realize and understand is that no one gives a damn about the &quot;who
&gt;&gt; you are&quot; they have only asked (repeatedly) that you stop ramming your
&gt;&gt; religions beliefs on everyone else in the group.

&gt; And repeatedly, I have denied doing so, but not one of you, including you,
&gt; has bothered to check to see if what I say is true or not, you just go
&gt; along with the claim that I am.

&gt; Now, tell me, where is the justice in that?

&gt;&gt; I hate to say, but by asking you to stop doing that is not a violation of
&gt;&gt; any law or constitutional freedom.  However, though it does not break a
&gt;&gt; law (that I know of) you are wrong to continue to force them on people
&gt;&gt; who have asked you time and time again to stop.

&gt; I would stop if I were in the wrong, but like I said a moment ago, you all
&gt; follow T-bone, theguy and Roy like good little lambs to slaughter, and
&gt; don't bother to see if what I'm saying is true or not. If that is
&gt; friendship, I'm better off without it.

&gt;&gt; Why most you insist on trying to convert everyone to your beliefs,
&gt;&gt; because that is what it strongly appears that you are trying to do.  You
&gt;&gt; have even gone so far in the past as to tell miles (IIRC) that he was
&gt;&gt; going to burn in hell because he did not follow your path of beliefs.

&gt; Larry, one more cotton picking time, I don't give a darn what you believe,
&gt; if you want Roy, T-bone or theguy as your god then fine, but darn it, I
&gt; WAS NOT PROSYLETIZING!!!!!

&gt;&gt; Look at it this way if it helps you see.  In the military I know you had
&gt;&gt; some form of EO training, right?  In that training, did they not teach
&gt;&gt; you that if even ONE, 1, UNO, person complained, (to you or someone else)
&gt;&gt; about something that was said or done, then you as the person who
&gt;&gt; did/said it, are wrong and any further such incidents will be ceased.

&gt; Not when I went thru, we still had a form of equal justice, the UCMJ, back
&gt; then it seems. It went before your NCO, your platoon leader, CO and then
&gt; upward if need be.

&gt;&gt; Well, this really is no different.  No one here has ever said you are not
&gt;&gt; free to worship as you please or to follow the religious path you choose.

&gt; Well, yes, they have, but no one will admit it, and in the service, btw,
&gt; I, as an NCO, was trained to chew butt in private, praise in public . .
&gt; .or has that been dropped also?

&gt;&gt; BUT we here are not you, nor do we desire to follow the same path as you,
&gt;&gt; so why can't you just post reference to the subject, WITH OUT all the
&gt;&gt; religious stuff with it?  I know you can, you know you can.

&gt; Ya know, look, again, at the beginning of this thread, Larry, but open
&gt; your eyes this time. Ken ( Nosey) brought the religion into this thread.
&gt; Go chew him out cause I ain't listening to any more of this stuff from
&gt; anyone. No one has the GUTS to admit I've made posts without religious
&gt; content.

&gt; Heck, I thought I was in your killfile anyway. Put me back, please, if
&gt; this is all I'll be getting from you.

And your point was noted and considered to be inapplicable to me.

Since I am not advocating any such murderous idealism, I'd like for you to
explain your intent with the comment, or is it just your PC way of saying "
I liked you better before you got religious"?

Why not just say it? Not that I'll change back, but at least it's a bunch
more honest.

BTW, you are full of shit, there hasn't been one damn post from you since
you came back to the group you said you were done with for good that DID NOT
have religion in it anywhere.  I have the guts you religious zealot, but you
don't.  You are hiding behind your beliefs, FORCING them on others and
REFUSE to stop.  You are not and never will be a God, so stop professing
like one.

And to set the record straight, there has NEVER been a time where I have
EVER said I was kill filing you, I was ignoring you.  But once again, you
play the victim, you force your religion on others that have said time and
time again they are not interested, and you KEEP going.

No one gives a FUCK about what YOU belief to be the truth or the word of
god, that is YOUR belief but you are to twisted in the damn head to
understand that NOTHING in here requires you to preach and to answer a damn
vehicle related question with ANYTHING about religion.  You are WRONG WRONG
WRONG to CONTINUE to push your beliefs on people that DO NOT WANT IT.  Even
a minister understands that when some one expresses that they are not
interested in it that they DO NOT keep forcing it.

You are the exact reason why I have denounced any form of organized
religion. Good day to you Preacher Budd

This is your choice, Larry, based on incorrect evidence and lies because you
chose to ignore the fact there is at least one post that makes you the liar.

But it is your choice. It also shows how little our past friendship meant to
you. I'm sorry you feel this way, but so be it. You are in God's hands now.
