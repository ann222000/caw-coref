The issue is that the first one in the string (one that plugs into the
wall) has to handle the load of whatever is connected at the end.
Years back, in an industrial research environment, we had power strips
that had one outlet on the &quot;far&quot; end, specifically for daisy chaining
the next outlet strip. Used them primarily in rack mounting systems.
Each strip was fused. If I was worried about total load issues, I put
a 4 outlet box and cable amidships, and then plugged 4 outlet strips
into that.

Examine/calculate the loads involved, and go from there.

If you are doing something like a workbench, there is some stuff
called &quot;plugmold&quot; that has a series of outlets every 8&quot; or so, for
just this purpose. You then have the &quot;wiremold&quot; system to use.

Yes and no.

As long as the total connected to BOTH powerstrips doesn't exceed the
load capacity of the first and the load on the second doesn't exceed
the load capacity of the single socket it's plugged into on the first,
you're OK.

For example:

Two 4 way strips with any combo in any socket of:

Phone charger
iPod Cradle
PDA cradle
PC
Modem Router
Monitor
Printer
(socket reserved for plug of second 4 way strip)

Even if oyu put all of those on plugged in to either strip, you'd be
OK.

I think it doesn't hurt, unless you are actually talking about an
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). Those probably must be placed
after a surge suppressor, probably immediately before the power

Although I can't find its documentation, I'm pretty sure my Belkin UPS
is supposed to be connected directly to the wall.  When I set it up I
presumed that that is because its own surge protection (along with its
voltage regulation) is a heckuva lot better than that provided by a
ten-buck power/surge strip.

I do this all the time, never had a problem.  Of course it's just
small electronics stuff.  You would not want to do this for power
tools or large appliances.  As long as the house is wired well, your
15A or 20A breaker will blow if it overloads no matter how many things
are plugged in.  These days, those black transformers waste half the
outlets anyhow, so you almost have to use several power strips.  If it
makes you feel better, plug one power strip into each of the wall
outlets on a duplex outlet (top and bottom one).  Either way, you
should be ok as long as the power strips have at least #14 cords, and
I'd avoid the really cheap ones.  You can also buy things that replace
the outlet cover and turn a standard duplex wall outlet into a 6
outlet unit.  Thats another option.  Computer stuff is all low
amperage, and I assume that is your use.  I wish they would make
strips that could handle 10 or more devices and had space between each
outlet for those transformers.

It shouldn't be a problem as long as it doesn't exceed the current
limitations of your wall socket. I do it all the time and plug them into
my APC 1500 UPS and let it handle it. My house outlets are all on 30a
circuits, but many homes may have as low as 15a-20a circuits. Check your
breaker box and see how your house outlets are configured just to be
safe about how much to plug into them.

Holy shit...... 30A outlets ??????
Where do you live?  We never see 30A circuits here in the Midwest US.
It used to be 15 was standard except in kitchens where 20 was often
found.  These days 20 is more common except lights which are mostly
still 15.  I worked as an electrician for years and to be honest, I'd
hate to have to run #10 wire for standard wall outlets, and the
outlets themselves would be difficult to even find here.  30A is
generally only used for 220 circuits.

Just to be sure things are safe, you are wired to handle 30A correct?
When fuses were still common, many people put 30A fuses in boxes where
the wiring was only intended to handle 15A or 20A.  (usually 15, with
#14 wire, which is dangerous as hell).  At least the average idiot
homeowner is incapable of changing breakers these days so the risk is
lower, except in old homes that still have fuses.

When you plug a UPS into a power strip protector, then that UPS
connects directly to an AC wall receptacle.  There is no voltage
regulation inside that power strip.  Between the Belkin and that wall
receptacle is maybe a fuse (absolutely essential) and a switch.
Protection between UPS and wall receptacle is mythical.

So where is the protector circuit? That circuit could be removed
from a power strip and plugged separately into the wall receptacle.
Nothing electrically changed.  None of that surge protector circuit is
between the Belkin and wall receptacle.  Yes, that should have you
asking some damning questions such as &quot;Why does the power strip
protector not even claim to protect from a type of surge that
typically damages electronics?&quot;

A 15 amp circuit breaker is necessary on every power strip - which
has no relationship to surge protection or Belkin operation.  Power
strip protector connects a Belkin UPS directly to AC wall receptacle.
Not well known because that power strip protector sells widely on
myths - such as mythical protection circuits between Belkin and AC
receptacle.

Why should a power strip protector not be on the Belkin output?
Because computer grade UPSes output some of the 'dirtiest' electricity
when in battery backup mode.    For example, this 120 volt UPS outputs
two 200 volt square waves with a spike of up to 270 volts between
those square waves.  It is a modified sine wave.  Electricity so
'dirty' as to harm some small electric motors.  But since computers
already contain internal protection, then 'dirty' electricity from the
UPS does not harm computers.

That same dirty electricity can be harmful to power strip
protectors.  Protectors being grossly undersized are adversely
affected by 'dirty' electricity output by a UPS.  Manufacturers
quietly recommend no power strip protectors on a UPS output.  Power
strip on a UPS input would be a direct connection to an AC wall
receptacle (via fuse and switch).

30 amp circuit breakers to standard duplex outlets is not code
legal.  Code states style outlets can be on which size circuit
breaker.  NEMA1-15, NEMA5-15, NEMA1-20 and NEMA5-20 not permitted on
30 amp circuits.   Plugs and receptacles for 30 amp circuits must be
NEMA5-30:

That's correct, otherwise it wouldn't work.

From the same document:

&quot;Do not plug surge protectors or power strips into

That's what I'm talking about. I guess it has something to do with a
surge suppressor being unable to handle the output waveform from the
UPS.

They cannot tell you everything that's okay to do. If there were
something wrong with plugging a UPS into a surge suppressor (not the
other way around), they would warn you against that.

Since use of the verb 'parse' makes no sense, then I cannot rectify
the confusion.

Meanwhile, a UPS connects electrically directly to an AC wall
receptacle; whether connected directly, via a power strip, or via a
power strip protector.

The original quote said:

As noted, it is whether the connection is via power strip or
directly to wall receptacle.

&gt; surge protection (along with its voltage regulation) is a
&gt; heckuva lot better than that provided by a ten-buck
&gt; power/surge strip.
">

Don't presume.  As noted in the previous post, that protector has no
protection between UPS and power strip.  But don't stop there.  The
protection provided by the UPS is electrically same as the protection
inside that UPS.  If in doubt, well, the only manufacturer claims
worthy of your attention are the manufacturer numerical specs.  Notice
there is no claim of protection for each type of surge - just like the
power strip also does not claim.

They both have the electrically same protector circuit.  Confirm
that with the numbers.  And both protector circuits would be
electrically unchanged if removed from the unit and plugged into the
other outlet of that duplex wall receptacle.

How does a light bulb and a UPS both connect to AC mains?  Well
protector circuit and UPS connect to AC mains the same way.  With or
without protection inside or outside; a UPS makes a direct connection
to AC wall receptacle.  Protection circuit inside UPS is electrically
the same circuit inside a power strip protector.  Don't take my word
for it.  Post those numerical specs.

I don't know from a reliable authority the exact technical reason that
it's bad biz to plug a surge strip into the output side of a UPS unit.
I won't *do* it, but I don't mind remaining ignorant about the physics

I believe the manual's use of &quot;into the wall&quot; means...well, &quot;into the

Hell, it *could* go into the drain hole in the tub. :)  Because the

we know, what &quot;into the wall&quot; means.

&gt;&gt; &quot;surge strip&quot; from the drug store.

&gt; Even if that were true, nobody is recommending a cheap power strip in
&gt; front of a UPS.

I thought I saw, way upthread someone (please carefully note that
&quot;someone&quot; does not mean &quot;John Doe&quot; - although it also does not by nature
necessarily exclude him) suggesting it was okay to place a surge strip
between the wall and the UPS.  But whether or not that is the case, I
still believe that &quot;into the wall&quot; means what it says.

">

Complete nonsense.

If you want reliable information on surges and surge protection the IEEE
has an excellent guide at:
http://omegaps.com/Lightning%20Guide_FINALpublishedversion_May051.pd
and the NIST has a good one at:
http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/practiceguides/surgesfnl.pdf

The IEEE guide is aimed at those with some technical background. The
NIST guide is aimed at the unwashed masses.

Both guides say plug-in suppressors are effective.

Plug-in suppressors certainly do claim to protect from surges that
damage electronics.
The IEEE guide explains plug-in suppressors work by clamping the voltage
on all wires (signal and power) to the common ground at the suppressor.
Ratings range from junk to very high.

Note that all  interconnected equipment needs to be connected to the
same plug-in suppressor, or interconnecting wires need to go through the
suppressor. External connections, like phone, CATV, ... also need to go
through the suppressor. Connecting all wiring through the suppressor
prevents damaging voltages between power and signal wires. These
multiport suppressors are described in both the IEEE and NIST guides.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   That same dirty electricity can be harmful to power strip
&gt; protectors.
">

I agree that plug-in suppressors should not be connected to the output
of a UPS.

UPSs can be connected to a plug-in suppressor. It would be better if the
suppression was then primarily done by the plug-in suppressor, not the
UPS. Plug-in suppressors are readily available with very high ratings -
probably much higher than what is easily available in a UPS. If I had a
UPS, I would rather have low surge suppression in the UPS and plug it in
to a plug-in suppressor with very high ratings.

In the original quote, if the Belkin UPS had significant surge
suppression, Belkin probably wouldn’t want an additional suppressor
between its UPS and the outlet.

---------------------------------
Regarding the original question - UL says power strips “are not intended
to be series connected (daisy chained) to other [power strips] or to
extension cords”. I haven’t seen a reason, but wiring can rapidly become
a mess and overloading becomes more likely.

It doesn't say &quot;recommend&quot; and that's not a recommendation, it's
instruction for setting up your UPS.

They are simply telling you to plug your UPS into the wall before

Some manufacturers will not honour warranties if there is a failure and an
extension cord/power distribution bar of any sort is used in the setup.
The reason being that many extensions are constructed by the user/owner
and in many cases do not follow the standards for connector connections
thus rendering useless any surge protection that may be incorporated in
the commercial UPS etc.  For example many people do not even bother with
such mundane requirements as ground/earth connections at all so that MOVs
between hot and gnd an neutral and gnd on the UPS would not be functional
at all.

I guess that depends on what &quot;any sort&quot; means.

We don't refer to surge suppressors as &quot;extension cords&quot; or &quot;power
distribution bars&quot;.

I'm familiar with electronics. Constructing surge suppressors isn't
very popular AFAIK. They are a very simple design and much cheaper to
buy from a store.

Extension cords are frowned upon because sometimes they are not rated
for the current required by the device.

Yes, sometimes people don't use properly grounded connectors, but
that's another subject too.

But in fact, typically an electronics hobbyist makes stuff because
it's fun and educational, not to save money. It might not be perfectly
constructed, but most of it is by the book.

Some surge suppressors claim to insure connected equipment up to
$100,000 or more.

Read closer some of those fine print warranties.  From the wording,
a protector from any other manufacturer in the building may void the
warranty.  That warranty is typically chock full of exemptions for
good reason.  Warranty need not be honored, but warranty is cited as
'proof' that the protector will do something?  When did words from a
lawyer constitute science proof? Nothing in that warranty says
anything about protection.  But it does list numerous reasons why the
warranty need not be honored.

What does that protector circuit in a UPS do?  Again, where are
manufacturer numbers that define each type of surge and that
protection - with numbers?  I keep asking for these specs.  Why can no
one provide them?   Because those specs do not claim protection as
implied by so many here.

Protector circuit in a UPS is the same protector circuit found in
$10 and in $150 power strip protectors.  That circuit will protect
from a type of surge that typically does not cause damage.  Therefore
it provides surge protection. Therefore they did not lie.  They just
forget to mention: it does not even claim to protect from the type of
surge that typically causes damage.

But again, if you believe the UPS has surge protection, then you
have numbers.  Post them.  What are those numbers for each type of
surge?  Why are same numbers also found in numeric spec sheets for
plug-in protectors?  Why?  Same circuit.

Remove that circuit from a power strip or UPS.  Plug it into the
other receptacle in a duplex power outlet.  Protection circuit remains
electrically same.  Protector circuit provides exact same protection.
Appreciate how plug-in and UPS protectors are constructed.  Appreciate
what manufacturer numerica specs really say.  Appreicate why UPS and
power strip protectors have same protection circuits.  Appreicate
which type of surges that circuit does and does not protect from.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Moral of the story:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't expect a warranty if you do anything other than what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; product is described to do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Exactly!!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What product is described to do?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What an incredible lack of definition. You could team up as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;obscure brothers&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah one has to be able to 'read' the package and warranty insert.

&gt;&gt; Are you sure there is such a thing as a UPS warranty that excludes
&gt;&gt; putting a surge suppressor between a wall outlet and the UPS? I'm
&gt;&gt; sure that in some cases it's recommended, especially (but not only)
&gt;&gt; for a UPS that includes no surge suppression.

&gt; I don't care about your imaginary situations.

So you really aren't bright enough to see that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is rather long in some cases. What with your ADD, DDT,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bipolar disorder and numerous other mental anomalies, it must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible for you to get through it.

&gt;&gt; Your mother disagrees, JAD.

I didn't say I don't like your mother, JAD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  *what THE product is described to do according to packaging
&gt;&gt;&gt;  details.

&gt;&gt; That's weird IMO.

&gt;&gt; How does &quot;what the product is described to do&quot; involve being
&gt;&gt; connected to a surge suppressor?

&gt; Pffft. there is a booklet that comes with UPS and power strips that
&gt; describes in great detail what to do and what not to do.

So now it's what to do, not what the UPS does.

&gt; And for 'you' they even have pictures.

I already have pictures of your mom, JAD.
