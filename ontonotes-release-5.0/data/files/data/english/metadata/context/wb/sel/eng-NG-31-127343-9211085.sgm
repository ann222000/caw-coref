Learn how a forecast range of '13 - 14' is more accurate than '13 -
17' (14 verifies) and a forecast of '3' is more accurate than '3-5' (2
verifies).

Also learn how one hit trumps numerous false alarms.

OMG - there is no shame there.

I notice they didn't dwell on (or mention at all), that JB's &quot;threat
zone&quot; was a complete and utter laughable BUST.  IIRC - he fixated (as
did others) on the increased prob of landfalling hurricanes in the
US.  That did not happen this (or last) season, after near breathless
hype of the potential (an idea raised by Dr. Gray at CSU about a
DECADE earlier - and borne out...on a decadenal timescale)...

Further research finds A-W predicted '6 - 7 tropical systems' would
hit the US mainland.

Meanwhile...over @ StormVista...'He Who Shall Not Be Named' is
claiming victory...as well.
&quot;My forecast calls for 15 Named storms of which10 will be hurricanes
and 3 intense Hurricanes. IF the La Nina reaches the strong threshold
criteria at any point during hurricane season months of August
September October... you can raise those numbers to 18 12 and 6
respectively.&quot;

OCT/s NINO 3.4 Region SSTA was -1.38°C.  A SST anom &gt;= 1°C is
considered strong...so WxRisk/s forecast was  _clearly_ more accurate.

The definitions of 'victory' and 'accurate' may have changed.

I think this is the sort of Victory Declaration that will soon be
(hopefully) used to (mostly) exit the Sandbox (Saddam's old 'hood).

This is why I suspect we don't get more &quot;pro&quot; mets entering this
contest - as there is a very quantifiable verification and ranking
methodology used - which eliminates the 'proof by handwaving' type of
argument.  Now I realize there's more to a foreast than just total
snowfall - but heck - I could predict that tomorrow is going to be
crappy and everyone in the NE should stay home hunkered in their
basements in mortal fear for their lives (e.g. typical TV forecast for
winter storms now-a-days_.
