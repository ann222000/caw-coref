Just a brief Miles household update...

First, thanks for all the purrs for me to get the job but
unfortunately this time they didn't work. :o( I keep telling myself
that the job is out there, but it is hard not to get demoralised. :o(

Anyhoo.... onto the news. :o)

Today, I went to the Dogs Trust in Bridgend. The Dogs Trust is a large
no-kill humane society that deals, as the name suggests, with rehoming
dogs. :o)  I've been thinking about adopting another dog for a while,
partly because Bonnie, my GSD/CollieX spends all her time with my gran
as her assistance dog now.

So I went looking on the off chance today. And I've met a very nice,
gentle, smallish, tri-coloured Border Collie girl called Clara. Clara
is 8 years old and was found wandering the streets in May. She had
clearly been badly abused because she was completely bald with a flea
allergy dermatis and infected skin, and she's afraid of men as she
cowers away from them and shakes.

So Clara and I had a walk and a chat, she really does have the most
expressive ears and great brown eyes, and I've booked her for
adoption. If all goes well with the Home Visit tomorrow and her
meeting with my neighbour who will dog sit her during the week when we
go and visit her on Sunday, then I will be bringing her home next
wednesday. :o)

Lord knows what the feline residents will think. Her history with cats
is unknown, but she hasn't shown any nasty tendencies, so I reckon
with careful introductions we should be OK.

Please wish us all luck that this works out well. :o)

Thanks

Helen M

Sorry to hear about the job thing.  Something will come your way.  I'm
out of work and looking also.  My problem is I have no marketable
skills.  Maybe I should hit the books instead of the pavement?

Congratulations on your new found friendship with Clara.  I hope the
pooties accept her just as you have.

Sorry to hear about the job falling through, but you'll
find something you really like soon. You are always
in our thoughts and prayers.

We will be purring and praying that Clara becomes a
great companion to the kitties and quickly.

Wow! Lots of luck with the intro, I expect you'll need it though hope you

If you get a good Border Collie I reckon you've got the best.

We will be sending purrs and lots of doggie drool and ear twitches for you
and yours and for Clara.

Kayla says Clara should be fine if she can overcome her fears.  Borders are
a &quot;soft&quot; dog and most cannot tolerate what many would only consider firm
handling.  They are smart hardworking dogs, but a lot of them will cringe in
fear if you yell at them.  Or even if someone they are around yells at
someone else.

Kayla has demonstrated the last few weeks that she was bred to be a
babysitter.  I don't know what else could explain how patient she is with
the PITA Chihuahua Camille.  Camille plans to grow up to be a holy terror.
Kayla is as gentle with her as she would be with a newborn lamb of a flock
of baby ducks or geese.

So we are all pulling for Clara.  (Oh, and I'm really wild about tricolors)

Oh, I'm sorry! :(  It sounded like such a great opportunity, and I
really wanted you to get it! I've had periods of unemployment, and
have prayed for exciting jobs to come through, and they didn't, so I
know how you feel... and it's hard not to get demoralized, but you
will bounce back, once you get over the disappointment. And you'll
find something good, I'm sure of it!

you!

I'm sorry it didn't work out.  Yes, I'm sure it is difficult not to be
discouraged at times.  I have a recommendation.  Set up a file, and whenever
anybody says, posts, or emails you a positive comment - something that makes
you feel good - put it in that file.  Before you go for a job interview,
read everything in the file.  I've read that you have a much better chance
of getting a job if you appear confident, rather than discouraged or
desperate.  One of these days, hopefully not too far in the future, the
absolutely perfect job will come along and you will get it.  I know you'll
live up to the demands of the job, whatever they might be.

Congratulations and best of luck with Clara.  I believe Border Collies are
one of the smartest, if not *the* smartest, breed of dogs, so I'm sure
she'll do whatever adapting is necessary.  Of course, she may try to herd
the cats.  ;-)

Wow, what a great idea! I'm not job-hunting, but I imagine that someday
I will be. It's a good thing to keep in mind.

Also, you can request positive feedback from people. One year, for my
birthday, I asked all my friends to give me a card or letter that told
me what they appreciated about me or our friendship, or both. I got lots
of cards, and they are all in an envelope in a drawer of my nightstand.
I read it from time to time when I feel depressed or down on myself. It
really helps!

Actually, for job-hunting, I've sometimes sat and read positive reviews
from former managers to get me in the right frame of mind. So I really
second the suggestion.

Sorry about this.  You're a very smart, capable, and worthy
person and the right job for you will come along.  Just keep
plugging away and you'll find the career that suits you.

On a down note.  Qui Gun Kit was in the room when I told Rob
about you and Clara checking each other out, and that you'll be
adopting each other if all things go ok.  I left to take a shower
and came back to find that my keyboard had been moved.  Rob
denies all responsibility, so I think it was one of the cats.  Be
warned.  The Crackhead takes his responsibilities towards Miss
Lilywhiskers seriously.

Sorry about the job.  There will be another one that is just right for you
that you will get.
I'm so pleased you are getting Clara.  IME of dogs I like them best at 6
years plus.  By that time they have grown out of all the hooligan stuff and
have an extensive understanding of human words and body language.
Hope everything goes well, I know you will hang in there if there are a few
blips at first, otherwise I wouldn't have agreed you have KFC if I had died
in 05.
I miss having dogs.  They bring joy to a walk in the countryside.

&gt; years plus.  By that time they have grown out of all the hooligan stuff and
&gt; have an extensive understanding of human words and body language.
&gt; Hope everything goes well, I know you will hang in there if there are a few
&gt; blips at first, otherwise I wouldn't have agreed you have KFC if I had died
&gt; in 05.
&gt; I miss having dogs.  They bring joy to a walk in the countryside.

Thanks Tweed. :o)

I'm looking forward to having her. Hopefully it'll go well with the
cats too. They don't worry so much about dogs, in that I've
successfully introduced Bonnie and my brothers black lab, Shadow, to
them, but Clara is an unknown quantity at the moment and I am still
trying to work out the best way to arrange the house so that they can
come and go through the cat flap in the kitchen without being ambused
by a nosey border collie!

Could I give you a call next week to discuss BC behaviour please?

Yes, sure, if you think it would be helpful.  Is your email address valid?
I'll mail you my phone number.

That might be a problem.  Everyone here gets along fine, but Kayla considers
the ambush her god given duty.  She doesn't touch the cats but she does run
up to check them out if they have been out of her sight for a few minutes.

She also wants to stand up against the kitchen counter to watch them eat.
That we really try to discourage.

They're used to an ambush and a &quot;nose up the bum&quot; from Bonnie, and
just slap her upside the head in disgust. I'm hoping they'll become
the same way with Clara. With any luck, she'll learn very quickly that
they are her cats, and I suspect that Lily will want to play, because
she likes dogs.

Paws crossed.

&gt; Just a brief Miles household update...

&gt; First, thanks for all the purrs for me to get the job but
&gt; unfortunately this time they didn't work. :o( I keep telling myself
&gt; that the job is out there, but it is hard not to get demoralised. :o(

&gt; Anyhoo.... onto the news. :o)

&gt; Today, I went to the Dogs Trust in Bridgend. The Dogs Trust is a large
&gt; no-kill humane society that deals, as the name suggests, with rehoming
&gt; dogs. :o)  I've been thinking about adopting another dog for a while,
&gt; partly because Bonnie, my GSD/CollieX spends all her time with my gran
&gt; as her assistance dog now.

&gt; So I went looking on the off chance today. And I've met a very nice,
&gt; gentle, smallish, tri-coloured Border Collie girl called Clara. Clara
&gt; is 8 years old and was found wandering the streets in May. She had
&gt; clearly been badly abused because she was completely bald with a flea
&gt; allergy dermatis and infected skin, and she's afraid of men as she
&gt; cowers away from them and shakes.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Please wish us all luck that this works out well. :o)

&gt; Thanks

Poor doggie! I'm sure she'll be very happy in your home, Helen.
Lots and lots of purrs and best wishes for a great job to come your way,
Polonca and Soncek
