Many British spellings of words are longer than American spellings:

(British --- American)

colour --- color
cataloque --- catalog
cheque --- check
manoeurvre --- maneuver

Some spellings are the same length:

centre --- center
criticise --- criticize
tyre --- tire

A skillful observer has probably seen a few British spellings that are
shorter than American spellings.  I have a particular word in mind.  What is
it?

I noticed that you spelled &quot;skilful&quot; wrongly in that post, so I guess
that's the American spelling.

Perhaps it would behove me to enrol for another instalment of lessons
centring on avoiding wilful ignorance. After that I may have learnt
something. However, maybe I dreamt it, but one spelt they way you

Pardon my spelling nit, but in my perusals of British literature I have yet to come across a 'cataloque' (possibly some
sort of melon) or a 'manoeurvre' (the mind boggles).

But one potential answer to your question would be leapt vs. leaped.

&quot;Skilful&quot; and &quot;skillful&quot; was the word (were the words?) I had in mind.
Mostly, I just wanted to create a puzzle based on British vs. American
spellings, and to see creative replies.

ObChallenge: Create a short verse (e.g.,  a Limerick) based on British vs.
American spellings.

Example:

There once was a biker called Janet
Who rode all over the planet
When in London she wrote &quot;y&quot;,,
But in New York she wrote &quot;i&quot;,
When spelling some devices that ran it.

Answer: tyres/tires

I thought the puzzle was about different spellings rather than different

A while back someone brought up trunk vs boot
for the storage space at the back of a car.
&quot;Trunk&quot; is pretty obvious, particularly when you
consider some older models in which it actually
_was_ a trunk attached to the car.  But so far
I haven't a clue where &quot;boot&quot; comes from as a
name for that space.  None of the many meanings
of &quot;boot&quot; gives me a hint, nor does the possible
French origin of the word.

It seems obvious to me. The bonnet (worn on the head) is at the top end of
the car, and the boot (worn on the foot) is at the bottom end of the car.

I saw some guy on some talkshow, who said he had ordered some
pancakes for breakfast in England. About an hour later, they
came out with six pound cakes! He said, &quot;What's this? These

Well, on a stagecoach it was called a boot - it turns out
that there's one in the front and one in the rear, but I

Thanks. I Googled &quot;stagecoach boot&quot; and found myself
in the Afrolumens Project (afro-american history) in a
note,

&quot;The stagecoach boot was a leather storage
area for passenger baggage and mail&quot;

Well, the boot, footware, is sort of a leather storage area
for a lower leg.  An analogy does suggest itself.

Alternatively on http://www.takeourword.com/TOW124/page4.html there is
another suggested origin:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   From Steve Parkes:

&gt;     Do you remember Dale Robertson in the tv series &quot;Wells Fargo&quot;? Of
&gt;     course not, you're both too young. Wells Fargo operated a number

&gt;     they're still in business?) The wheels used to go round backwards,
&gt;     as I recall... enough!  To the point: the stagecoach had a big box
&gt;     or trunk strapped on the back to hold passengers' luggage, and
&gt;     this was called the boot, apparently from the French word boîte,
&gt;     meaning &quot;box&quot;.
