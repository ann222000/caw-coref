EVERYONE knows that it means: turn left when oncoming traffic clears!

So why don't Florida traffic engineers use it like all the SANE
traffic engineers in the majority of other states?

No, I've been driving for over 15 years and have never seen one.  Until
you posted this, I had never heard of a blinking left turn arrow, let
alone had previous knowledge of what it means.

I do know that a solid left turn arrow means that one cannot make a left
turn.  I do know that a solid red light means that one may make a turn
(right on most roads, left onto a one way street with traffic flowing
from your right to your left, and if you're outside of NYC).  I do know
that a blinking solid red light is the same as a stop sign.

What states would those be?  I've never seen it, and have lived/driven
in quite a few states.

Doesn't a green ball mean the same thing?  What's the point?

Flashing red left arrow is a new one.  Two errors in your assumption:
the majority of states using them (evidence is lacking), and all
traffic engineers are sane.  Got to remember, most of them kiss
politician arse so the citation revenue flows and the engineers get
paid.

Right, Brent? Or Nate?

1 - I've never seen it in use here in California.

2 - When I've seen a blinking red arrow, it's been at an intersection
where the left turn lane is posted &quot;Left Turn on Green Arrow Only&quot;.
When I see the blinking red arrow, do I make a left turn after
yielding to oncoming traffic, or do I have to wait (possibly for
hours) until a green arrow is displayed, as indicated by the sign?

3 - I spent a weekend in Jacksonville 3 years ago.  I noticed a
traffic control convention that I had never seen before.  On a multi-
lane street there was a separate traffic signal for every single
lane.  When the green ball was displayed for the left-turn-only lane,
it signified what a green left-arrow signifies everywhere else - that
the left turn has the right of way.  When the red ball was displayed
for the left-turn-only lane, left-turn-lane traffic had to stop.
Perhaps a blinking red ball for the left-turn-only lane would be
understood as you intend.

As one would expect I drove the easternmost miles of I-10 to see if
there was any signage for Los Angeles or Santa Monica, CA, its western
terminus [there was not], or any signage identifying the &quot;Christopher
Columbus Transcontinental Highway&quot; [there was not].

I see misterfartz is back from the grave, starting new threads
covering the same ground as threads he started several months ago
did.  Ugh.
Anyway, it's been pretty well established that:
Blinking Red Left Arrow Phase means the same as a full stop and then
make your left turn when clear (which theoretically may be 'never', if
opposing traffic never clears) - these have been around awhile, but
are fairly rare, although I wish they weren't (i.e. they could easily
replace those time wasting left turn on green arrow only signals).
Blinking Yellow Left Arrow Phase are somewhat new, and mean what a
green ball signal also does - left turners yield on green, but if no
opposing traffic you need not stop before beginning your left - much
discussion has ensued on whether having 2 different signals mean the
same thing is wise or not - I remain skeptical.
So, in relation to turning left, a blinking red arrow must assuredly
is not the same as a green ball, while a blinking yellow arrow is
supposed to be equivalent to a green ball.

If this is Florida, it means &quot;Dangle your seatbelt out the door,
dragging on the pavement. Scrunch down so your little grey head is
barely visible over the dash of your Cadillac Deville. Proceed slowly
(very slowly) through the intersection, regardless of other traffic.&quot;

But then, that's what every other traffic signal means there. Just like
Bellevue, WA.

Around here, a blinking red arrow is an indication that the traffic
signal is either malfunctioning or has been switched to flash mode and
all the lights will be blinking either red (same meaning as a stop sign)
or yellow (proceed with caution.

You're not worth comprehending - too much effort for too little
payoff.  Your posts reflect a mind as critical and thoughtful as that
of Aunt Judy or Carl Taylor and are treated as such.

When you start demonstrating that you understand basic concepts of
traffic safety, physics, or civility, then I might consider making the
effort.  As it is, you're so wrong so often that pointing out all the
individual statements that you have made that are wrong and explaining

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm amazed that someone as stupid as you can still manage to string so

&gt; &gt; You should stop counting them and apply your diligence to
&gt; &gt; comprehension.

&gt; You're not worth comprehending - too much effort for too little

Well, if you had the tools, you wouldn't find comprehension quite so
difficult and frustrating.

&gt; When you start demonstrating that you understand basic concepts of
&gt; traffic safety, physics, or civility, then I might consider making the
&gt; effort.  As it is, you're so wrong so often that pointing out all the

&gt; why would be a full time job.

This, from the guy who claims anyone operating at the speed limit will
be &quot;run over&quot;; who believes lifting off the throttle causes
inconvenience beyond human endurance to drivers behind him; and who
believes all drivers, no matter their experience level, should be able
to drive as well as he; the guy who tailgates and refuses to back off
to allow another car to merge onto the highway?!

Puhleeze!  You've already posted all you know about driving,
practically all of it MFFY and riddled with that special r.a.d. brand
of ignorance.

You should probably limit your participation here to asking questions,
then accepting whatever answer you feel is most wrong as correct.
