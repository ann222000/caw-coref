The Cadillac Ranch site ( former and dedicated site to Jan Joosse ) is
down for more than a week now.
It's still there, but Lars Stian ,&quot; the chief &quot; is having some trouble
with his hosting provider. (or more accurately, they are having the
problems, with their servers to be precise) He told me it would be one
or two days before it would be up and runnin' again, so he's not
overly concerned.. Lousy timing though..

I have had some contacts afterwards with Lars Stian last week and this
is what he had to say about it:

Looks like things have gotten a bit tougher than expected, some parts
of the
databse is lost, due to some unannounced upgrade from the
serviceprovider. I am
now working on getting it all back up, but as the database is all now
consisting
of .txt-files, it'll be some time before I can get it back online.
Unfortunately, due to these errors, I'm not able to send out any email
to
members of the board, so please pass this on.

With apologies,

Caddy ( Lars Stian )

So pass it on !!!!

What's the URL.

I remember Jan's site very well.  In the pre-torrent days it was a
huge vine site, lots of great artwork, etc.  He is sorely missed.

Speaking of down sites, what ever happened to TheBoots.net?  I haven't
been able to get there for months.
