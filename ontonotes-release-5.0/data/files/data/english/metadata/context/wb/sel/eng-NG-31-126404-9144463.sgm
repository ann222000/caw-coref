I know everyone has their opinion but what is a good all around size? Is 14&quot;
screen too small for most people? Is 17&quot; too bulky?

Thank-you

I suspect it is personal preference.   17&quot; is too bulky for me as I
travel a lot on business with my laptop.    14&quot; or 15&quot; is fine with me
though I like some of the ultra-lite portables with even smaller screens.

I previously had a 15&quot; 1400x1050 SXGA+ screen and replaced it with
a 15.4&quot; widescreen 1680x1050 WSXGA+.  I could have gotten a lower
resolution screen but I didn't want to lower the 1050 dimension.

If I were to do it over, I probably would have gotten the 17&quot; screen.
As I'm in my early 50's it's sometimes hard to read and I have to
adjust the font size (using mouse scrolling).

What is the issue when traveling? Is it lighter weight, or is it smaller
size being easier to handle?

Well...yes   for practical reason.....You need to minimize the weight
and bulk  of the baggage that you have to lug around...But there are
times that I still bring the 17incher if I don't have lots of things
to bring in my trip...
In the past I have tried the ultra lights but was uncomfortable to use
with my ' big hands'&lt;grin&gt;.....

If you travel in economy class and a person sitting in front of you
reclined the seat, 15-incher would not be able to open up completely on
the tray (17-inch is even worse).  You'll have to tilt screen slightly
towards yourself.  14-inch laptop may barely fit or fit comfortably
depending on the actual model - bevel around the screen varies in width a
lot between models.

That's my personal experience.

IMO
The real problem with big notebooks is that they don't have enough
battery juice for long haul trips and not all planes have good
adaptors for huge laptops either....

Remember, 12&quot; don't have full-size keyboards.

If you really fly a lot, a 14&quot; widescreen is probably best.

Personally I like 14&quot; standard aspect (not widescreen) the best.

My 15&quot; standard aspect stays on my desk.  I didn't think the extra size
would bother me, but it does.  Also, laptops with bigger screens usually
have power-hogging graphics cards and CPUs, and therefore bad battery
life and are too hot to use in your lap.  I guess manufacturers figure
they'll only be used as desktop replacements anyways.

Of course, resolution is also important.  The 14&quot; widescreen I have now
feels noticeably cramped, but it would really help if the resolution
were more than 1280x800.

!4&quot; widescreen with 1440x900 sounds reasonably good.  I had 13.3&quot; laptop
with standard ratio (think it was 1400x1050 = SXGA) a long time ago -
perfect.  Batteries were crap back then though.

For just wandering around use, it's personal preference - how much
you don't mind carrying, what fits where you're going. I've seen some
huge laptops perched on little cafe tables or wedged onto airline
trays.
Currently, own laptop wardrobe consists of:
Daily driver - IBM X31 with 12&quot; XGA display. Weighs about 3 lbs,
good battery life, good keyboard feel, well-built.
Meetings/outings/who-knows - IBM Transnote with 10&quot; SVGA. The
built-in writing and drawing pad is convenient and even with 600Mhz it
still gets the job done. And it doesn't look like a laptop at first
glance, which I like.
Sony VAIO Picturebook = 9&quot; widescreen display. The t-note doesn't
look like a laptop at first glance? With the p-book, people ask why
I'm typing on my portable DVD player. Tiny, lightweight at 1kg, good
battery life, and does pert near everything. This will fit on any
table or tray, into most any case, and can even be used one-handed
while just standing around. In addition to being a workhorse, running
W2K and Office 2k3, it's a playmate with 15 hours of music files and
30-some hours of video, and several games. This is my travel machine,
letting me kill time while I'm on the road (which invariably means
waiting a lot at various places) and helping get the job done when I
(finally) arrive.
I don't mind a big screen - I've got a 20&quot; LCD attached to my X31's
dock as I write this - but I'm not a fan of the huge screens attached
to laptops these days. I'd much rather technology had gone the route
of 12&quot; screens with 10 hours of battery life than 17&quot; displays with 3
hours.

Get the smallest laptop that has a keyboard your fingers can type on.
Then get the fastest processor that still has the required battery life.
Then get the highest resolution that your eyes can still see while doing
the work that you need done.

Then start scaling back your expectations  to fit your budget.

90% of laptop users WANT much more than they NEED.  The good news
is that those people provide used machines to the rest of us at
10 cents on the dollar.

Determine YOUR NEEDS.  Someone else's opinion can only help
you examine issues you haven't thought about yet.

I like standard aspect screens more than widescreen because they are
much taller and also have more surface area.

That is, a 14&quot; 4:3 screen is larger (more surface area) than a 14&quot;
widescreen.

I also think height is more useful than width.  How often do you scroll

My favourite screen ever was the 14.1&quot; 1400x1050 on my old Asus Z80K

The processors on the smaller models are slower. The fastest on the Sony 11&quot;
