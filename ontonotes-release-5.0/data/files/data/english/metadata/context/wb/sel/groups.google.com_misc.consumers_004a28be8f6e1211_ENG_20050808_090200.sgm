At Online Stores, Sniffing Out Crooks Is a Matter of Survival
Mr. Kugelman Gets Scammed By a Web-Site Customer;
A $3,077 Platinum Chain

By MITCHELL PACELLE
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
August 4, 2005

LYNBROOK, N.Y. -- Six years ago, Neil Kugelman found himself puzzling
over the very first customer to arrive at the Web site he had launched
to sell jewelry online.

The order: a $496 men's diamond ring. The North Carolina address didn't
match the address tied to the credit card. The shipping address was
different still. Mr. Kugelman tried to telephone the customer, but the
number didn't work. His email bounced back. He was no expert on fraud,
but neither was he born yesterday. He spiked the order.

&quot;Our first order -- order No. 1 -- was fraudulent,&quot; he marvels.
[Neil Kugelman]

Since then, as family-controlled Goldspeed.com Inc. grew from a
basement start-up to a 10-person operation that fills more than 50,000
orders a year, Mr. Kugelman has taught himself to regard each and every
customer as a potential online crook -- and with good reason. He says
fraudulent orders have risen to a staggering 30% of the total, up from
just 5% when he started.

Over the years, Mr. Kugelman, 44 years old, got so good at sniffing out
the cons that just 0.5% of his sales were lost to fraud. But a run-in
he had seven months ago with a cagey crook who ordered $8,384 of flashy
jewelry -- and stuck him with his largest fraud loss ever -- has left
him worried that the bad guys are now gaining the upper hand. The tale
of Mr. Kugelman's unsuccessful effort to discover the fraud, despite
his suspicions, shows the increasing perils faced by the burgeoning
online retail industry.

For Mr. Kugelman and other Internet retailers, ferreting out bogus
orders is a matter of survival. When a crook uses a stolen credit card
in a traditional store, and the store follows proper procedures, the
card-issuing bank usually swallows the loss. For online retailers, the
tables are turned. Credit-card association rules dictate that merchants
who accept charges from cyberspace, a riskier endeavor, must also
shoulder the risk of fraud.

When Mr. Kugelman began peddling everything from pearl earrings to
thick gold chains over the Internet in 1998, his biggest problem was
simple credit-card fraud: the use of stolen account numbers. The bogus
orders were often glaringly obvious. Fraudsters ordered big and
requested next-day shipping. They left fake phone numbers. They placed
odd orders, such as for two engagement rings. Mr. Kugelman designed a
computer system to screen incoming orders for such red flags and to
bounce suspicious ones into human hands.

Over time, the crooks got better. More of them stole whole identities,
using purloined personal information to set up entirely new credit-card
accounts. They used untraceable cellular phones, and avoided making
oversized orders. When Mr. Kugelman phoned them with questions, they
didn't get rattled. He fine-tuned his system, incorporating proprietary
scoring guidelines based on such information as what kind of jewelry is
ordered and from what part of the country the order originates.

Late last year, he says, the fraudsters upped the ante. All of a
sudden, Goldspeed.com was getting orders that showed no obvious signs
of fraud on his computer-screening system, but seemed suspicious
nonetheless. On Jan. 9, for example, when a customer placed separate
orders on the same day, he thought &quot;something looked wrong.&quot;

A Vincenza Wells of Detroit had ordered a $1,199 Aqua Master men's
diamond watch. Four minutes later, the same customer ordered a $1,259
men's diamond and tanzanite ring. The Bank One Visa credit-card number
she supplied was good for the full amount, and she had provided the
validation code from the back of the card. Visa's address verification
system showed a match.

But the order's size, and the strange two-step ordering, had Mr.
Kugelman's radar up. The next day, he called the card issuer, J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which had acquired Bank One. He says a bank
representative confirmed that the name, address and phone number on the
order matched the bank's own account information, except for one small
detail about the address.

Mr. Kugelman called his customer, who explained the disparity to his
satisfaction. Mr. Kugelman called back the bank representative with the
revised information. She told him that bank security had phoned Ms.
Wells separately, and verified her identity.

Still wary, Mr. Kugelman tested the card number again to see if it had
been maxed out, a hallmark of identity theft. It hadn't. So he released
the watch and ring for shipment.

That afternoon, the same customer phoned in a third high-ticket order
for a $3,077 men's platinum chain and a $2,849 diamond engagement ring.
Again, the Visa card was good for the full amount. Goldspeed shipped
both items to Detroit, bringing Ms. Wells's total bill, with shipping,
to $8,432.

More than 100 miles from Detroit, in Sandusky, Ohio, the real Vincenza
Wells, proprietor of the Seacrest Motel, had no idea someone was
running up thousands of dollars of bills in her name. Last August, she
had received a phone call, purportedly from her cable company, offering
her three months of free service if she paid her bill in full a month
early. She happily provided credit-card information, her Social
Security number and other personal information. The caller was a crook.
Shortly thereafter, Bank One alerted her to questionable charges, and
she canceled her card.

In April, another bank representative called her to inquire about some
$15,000 in unpaid credit-card bills. She responded that she didn't even
have a card any more. &quot;These people had opened new accounts in my
name,&quot; she explained recently, expressing astonishment that, given the
previous fraud, J.P. Morgan had opened a new account in her name with a
new address. To set up the account, the fraudsters apparently used the
personal information that she had been tricked into providing over the
phone.

A spokesman for J.P. Morgan said the bank doesn't discuss individual
cardholder situations, but that it has &quot;a financial stake in stopping
all fraud before it happens.&quot; Michael Cunningham, head of fraud
prevention at J.P. Morgan's card division, said: &quot;We take a lot of
pride in our ability to detect identity theft. We don't catch 100% of
it.&quot;

On April 7, Mr. Kugelman learned for the first time, from a J.P. Morgan
investigator, that the jewelry charges were fraudulent, the result of
identity theft. For reasons that weren't made clear to Mr. Kugelman,
the bank opted to saddle him with only a portion of the loss, $5,950,
the amount of the third order. Days later, Mr. Kugelman's bank credited
the money back to J.P. Morgan. Mr. Kugelman protested, citing his
discussions about the order with the bank, and J.P. Morgan eventually
brought the case to a Visa arbitration panel set up to mediate such
disputes.

In June, Visa arbitrators ruled that Mr. Kugelman would have to eat the
loss. A spokeswoman for Visa declined to comment on the case, but noted
that Visa is developing procedures to reduce such charge-backs to
online merchants.

Mr. Kugelman says his fraud numbers are going up, in part because it's
so hard for him to recognize crooks with stolen identities. He says he
doesn't know how much the increased vigilance is costing him, but in
February, he reassigned a staffer to work exclusively on detecting
credit-card fraud.

&quot;The job has gotten harder and our systems have gotten more
sophisticated,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's a cat-and-mouse game. As we get
better, they get better.&quot;

"/> That's positively ASININE. That merchant bears ZERO responsibility for
that fraud, but is being left holding the bag? That's BULLSHIT.

Shame on you, VISA and J.P. Morgan!
