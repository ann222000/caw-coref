I remember reading RGP about 3-4 years ago when there had been much
discussion and even polls/votes regarding a moderated version of RGP
to eliminate much of the trolling, off topic discussions, etc.
although I am sure there were many other considerations and factors
than those.

I see that the membership in RGP has swelled considerably since that
time and I am wondering whatever became of that initiative?  Does such
a moderated group exist?

I think they started to create one and it got shit on and they gave up. I think
the voters that said unmoderated went to the moderated and swamped the
moderator.

Thanks for replying.

That's a shame if, rather than simply leaving it alone and staying
here, that people who didn't want something had to go and ruin
something that people who did want it tried to make.

Are there other newsgroups that anyone knows of for non-professional
(recreational) poker players who want to learn/discuss poker-related
issues where there aren't so many spammers, trolls and off-topic
threads as what is found here?  (Although I must say, it is nice that
so many of the OT threads are so clearly labeled as such-- that is
very considerate of the original posters to do!)

OT BAHH have been as a result of that. Most are excellent about that.

If you want morderated discussions then try 2+2 (4 as it is known here) or
Pocket Fives. There is a lot of cross over so don;t just leave us behind.

get a newsreader with a killfile and Spam detection and this place is not bad at
all.

Oops!  But not exactly.  Sigh.

Saw your post here and was excited (had previously done a search and
for some reason that group had not come up, hence, my original post
here).

But I just went there and it seems to be nothing more than a
repository for spammers, too.

Oh well.  Perhaps what I had envisioned when I had been here on RGP
four years ago was the wrong idea of what people had in mind who were
campaigning for the moderated group.

Oh, it was everything they wanted.  They threw on the tablecloth, set out
the plates, and nobody came for dinner.

Then, I suppose, they gave up out of sheer boredom, and stopped moderating.

If you were, perhaps, hoping for a censored version of RGP, with our
discussions sans all that nasty spam, OT stuff, etc... just learn to use a
killfile.

It'll be everything you'd hoped for, and, best of all, YOU get to play
moderator!

Cheers.

There are buttloads of moderated groups and discussion boards.

There is one major unmoderated one.

There are costs to being unmoderated obviously, but there are benefits
too, and this is the one place where you can be unmoderated.  It should
be left be.

Please email me with your

date and those 3 digits on the back of it, and some naked pictures of your wife

Actually, no. I mean, it exists, but it has no moderators. Without
moderators it isn't everything everyone could wish. It's just an empty shell
until some moderators are found for it.

What happened to the people who said they would do it?

No, no it doesn't.  It was never officially created as a
Usenet newsgroup, because the vote failed.

If you're confused about the difference between Usenet and
some half-competent Usenet provider (e.g. Google), I'd be

It was a joke, Patti.  (I could be wrong, but I think it is a &quot;newsgroup&quot;
even if it is misnamed.  I get my list from giganews and it seems to be
&quot;there.&quot;)

I am always eager to learn things and I only have limited knowledge of the
difference between Usenet and web service gateways into Usenet.  I am not
sure I use the terms correctly.  I have a general understanding but always
like to learn more.  (I know I never use Archie or Veronica any more to do
