Bug bomb
Why our next terrorist attack could come on six legs

(AP Photo)

By Jeffrey A. Lockwood  |  October 21, 2007

THE TERRORISTS' LETTER arrived at the office of the mayor of Los
Angeles on
Nov. 30, 1989. A group calling itself The Breeders claimed to have
secretly imported,
bred, and released the Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles and
Orange counties.
And they threatened to expand the attack into the San Joaquin Valley,
a major center
of California agriculture.

The &quot;Medfly&quot; had appeared that August in survey traps not far from
Dodger
Stadium, and officials were spraying in an effort to get rid of it.
The pest attacks
300 different fruits, vegetables, and nuts, reducing plant tissue to a
maggoty pulp
that rots and falls to the ground. An established infestation would
bring widespread
destruction and mean that produce could no longer be shipped out of
state, potentially
costing 132,000 jobs and $13.4 billion in lost revenues.

Eventually the infestation ended, after heavy spraying. There is still
debate about
whether ecoterrorists stoked the Medfly infestation, but the panic the
episode engendered
suggests that The Breeders were flirting with a powerful weapon.

One of the cheapest and most destructive weapons available to
terrorists today is
also one of the most widely ignored: insects. These biological warfare
agents are
easy to sneak across borders, reproduce quickly, spread disease, and
devastate crops
in an indefatigable march. Our stores of grain could be ravaged by the
khapra beetle,
cotton and soybean fields decimated by the Egyptian cottonworm, citrus
and cotton
crops stripped by the false codling moth, and vegetable fields
pummeled by the cabbage
moth. The costs could easily escalate into the billions of dollars,
and the resulting
disruption of our food supply - and our sense of well-being - could be
devastating.
Yet the government focuses on shoe bombs and anthrax while virtually
ignoring insect
insurgents.

Indeed, a great strategic lesson of 9/11 has been overlooked.
Terrorists need only
a little ingenuity, not sophisticated weapons, to cause enormous
damage. Armed only
with box cutters, terrorists hijacked planes and brought down the
towers of the
World Trade Center. Insects are the box cutters of biological warfare
- cheap, simple,
and wickedly effective.

&quot;I can write for you on a postcard a series of different ways to
paralyze the
agriculture industry of the United States, where we have no
possibility of being
able to respond,&quot; said Geoff Letchworth, the former director of the US
Department
of Agriculture's Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratory.

Insects have always carried the potential for great human catastrophe.
In the 14th
century, 75 million people succumbed to a flea-borne pandemic of
bubonic plague.
But few people realize that the Black Death arrived in Europe after
the Mongols
catapulted flea-ridden corpses into the port city of Kaffa. From
there, the people
fled and carried bacteria, rats, and fleas throughout the
Mediterranean.

And it was lice, not Western armies, that nearly broke the back of the
Soviet Union
when typhus sickened 30 million people and killed 5 million Russians
after World
War I. In 1919 Lenin pronounced, &quot;Either socialism will defeat the
louse, or
the louse will defeat socialism&quot; - and the insect nearly won.

Seeing the potential, military strategists have been keen to conscript
insects during
war. In World War II, the French and Germans pursued the mass
production and dispersion
of Colorado potato beetles to destroy enemy food supplies. The
Japanese military,
meanwhile, sprayed disease-carrying fleas from low-flying airplanes
and dropped
bombs packed with flies and a slurry of cholera bacteria. The Japanese
killed at
least 440,000 Chinese using plague-infected fleas and cholera-coated
flies, according
to a 2002 international symposium of historians.

During the Cold War, the US military planned a facility to produce 100
million yellow-fever-infected
mosquitoes a month, produced an &quot;Entomological Warfare Target
Analysis&quot;
of vulnerable sites in the Soviet Union and among its allies, and
tested the dispersal
and biting capacity of (uninfected) mosquitoes by secretly dropping
the insects
over American cities.

Americans largely believed that only underdeveloped nations had to
worry about insect-borne
diseases until the summer of 1999, when West Nile virus arrived. A
natural experiment
in entomological warfare unfolded as public-health agencies scrambled
to explain
and then control a debilitating disease. In the next seven years, the
technological
might of the United States could not keep mosquitoes from carrying a
disease across
the nation to sicken nearly 7,000 people and kill 654 victims. Lacking
a coherent,
national infrastructure for pest management, local agencies wasted
time, money,
and supplies, spraying insecticides on harmless mosquitoes and missing
windows of
opportunity for effective control.

West Nile virus is only the tip of the pathogenic iceberg. We are
vulnerable to
yellow fever, malaria, dengue fever, and various forms of
encephalitis. Add to this
list diseases carried by the eight-legged relatives of insects. Tick-
borne Lyme
disease can be a terrible affliction, but far worse would be Crimean-
Congo hemorrhagic
fever, which causes massive internal bleeding and kills one-third of
its victims.
The virus is transmitted by various ticks with close cousins in the
United States.

But given our losing battle against West Nile virus, the greatest
concern is its
African cousin, Rift Valley fever. Originally found in 1931, the viral
disease caused
abortions in pregnant livestock while young animals suffered 10 to 70
percent mortality.
In 1977, a virulent strain appeared that is able to invade the human
nervous system.
Of 200,000 Egyptians who fell ill, some 2,000 lost their eyesight and
598 died of
encephalitis. An outbreak in Kenya that killed 118 people just nine
months ago makes
clear that this disease is here to stay. Every region in the United
States has a
mosquito species capable of carrying this disease.

Nor would it be difficult to introduce Rift Valley fever, according to
Charles Bailey,
director of the National Center for Biodefense at George Mason
University. A person
with $100 worth of supplies, a set of simple instructions, and a plane
ticket from
an afflicted African nation to the United States could introduce the
disease with
virtually no chance of being caught, he said.

Americans are understandably worried about disease, and terrorists
would relish
the opportunity to introduce deadly pathogens. But our enemies are
also keenly aware
that we take our wealth as seriously as our health. The World Trade
Center was chosen
as an icon of the nation's economic prosperity. Yet agriculture
accounts for
a trillion dollars in economic activity and one in every six jobs in
the United
States. Barns, more so than office buildings, affirm the nation's
cultural identity.

An entomological attack would not deplete America's pantries, but it
could go
a long way to emptying our wallets. In economic terms, the terrorist
attacks on
Sept. 11, 2001, resulted in direct losses of $27.2 billion. The Asian
long-horned
beetle, which arrived in 1996, together with the emerald ash borer,
which was found
in 2002, have the potential to destroy more than $700 billion worth of
forests,
according to the USDA.

Consider the maize borer, a native of India, Thailand, and East Africa
that produces
seven generations per year. If this pest arrives, the USDA predicts
that it would
infest cornfields from the Eastern seaboard, across the Gulf Coast,
into the Pacific
Northwest. With crop losses of 88 percent in other countries, hundreds
of millions
of dollars of crops are at risk - along with our energy independence
as the United
States shifts to ethanol-based fuels.

Insect carriers of plant diseases keep orchardists awake at night. A
bacterial ailment
called citrus
