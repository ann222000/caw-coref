The Fight Against High-Level Corruption: Ending Impunity

Elizabeth G. Verville, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Bureau of International
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs
APEC Anticorruption Conference
Lima, Peru
October 29, 2007

Minister Zavala Valladares, Ambassador Capuñay, Your Excellencies,
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Ladies and Gentlemen:

The United States welcomes the opportunity to participate at this important
APEC event to advance our joint efforts to prevent and combat high-level
corruption, deny safe haven, and recover stolen assets.

I am particularly pleased and honored to participate in this opening session
and want to wish the Government of Peru every success in its leadership of APEC
in 2008. Es mi gran placer visitar Perú por la primera vez.

I believe that this Conference is perfectly timed and structured to make a
major contribution to the global fight against corruption.

Because of the commitment and hard work by APEC and other international
partners, we have made great strides in confronting this global scourge.

Once a taboo subject, today we regularly cooperate through frank and open
channels, rolling up our sleeves to work pragmatically in addressing governance
challenges and establishing a community of integrity.

We also have established strong national, regional and global frameworks to
combat corruption.

These synergies have strengthened our common agenda. I strongly believe that
the institutions and mechanisms we have put in place and the initiatives we are
taking through the United Nations, in APEC and other regional efforts and
nationally, in conjunction with civil society, the private sector and
international financial institutions can make a difference if we apply our
energy and ingenuity to the task.

Let me say a little about each of these levels of anticorruption efforts, and
why I have high expectations for the outcome of this Conference.

Global Efforts - the United Nations Convention against Corruption

The United Nations Convention against Corruption, affectionately called
&quot;UNCAC&quot;, now has 103 Parties and has globalized the fight against corruption.
No longer do we have one economy or set of economies telling others what they
should be doing to combat corruption. For the first time we have agreed on
global standards, so the question becomes not what we should be doing but how
well are doing in implementing the Convention and what help states parties
might need.

Dimitri Vlassis, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
Secretariat for the Conference of States Parties (COSP) can tell us more about
how implementation efforts are going.

The Parties identified at their first meeting last December the key issues for
initial concentration of implementation, including criminalizing the mandatory
Convention offenses and implementing mutual legal cooperation, asset recovery
and selected prevention provisions.

Utilizing a streamlined information-gathering tool and computer programs, Mr.
Vlassis will be able to inform the second meeting of the States Parties in
January in Indonesia of implementation progress and the kinds of technical
assistance that particular states parties may need in order to implement
specific priority Convention articles. As I am sure you know, the Convention
contains the first ever roadmap for cooperation on asset recovery, a subject at
the heart of our APEC agenda as well, and a subject on which Peru and the
United States worked very closely during the negotiation as co-sponsors of the
original proposals.

Regional Efforts - APEC Leaders' Commitment to Combat Corruption in the Asia
Pacific Region

APEC Leaders' have made a strong commitment to fight corruption, particularly
high-level corruption, most recently in Sydney to promote regional cooperation
on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the recovery and return of proceeds
of corruption.

Building on the will of our leaders, I propose that APEC members take a leading
role at the upcoming COSP by having the broadest rate of ratifications and
accessions and responses to UNODC's checklist on the status of implementation.

We should also seek to develop here in Lima specific ideas that we might take
to Indonesia to promote effective implementation of UNCAC, including in the
three working groups created by the Conference: asset recovery, review of
implementation and technical assistance. APEC is well positioned to take a
leading role at the COSP because of its regional high level initiatives over
the past several years. It is also fitting that we support Indonesia as host.

Because of the expertise assembled here on asset recovery, we especially would
like to see the APEC Anticorruption Task Force consider innovative programs to
strengthen cooperation and capacities on asset recovery.

One possibility would be for APEC to consider actions to advance the tracing of
the proceeds of corruption consistent with implementation of Chapter V of UNCAC
including by supporting capacity building activities so that economies have in
place the legal and institutional measures necessary for an effective asset
recovery regime.

APEC can also help lead the way by having pragmatic workshops to bring together
expert practitioners on legislative reform and law enforcement techniques
related to tracing of assets, forfeiture, and jurisdiction over assets located
abroad.

Capacity-building in crafting effective requests for mutual legal assistance is
another priority underscored by participants that APEC might consider.

National Efforts -- U.S. Efforts to Combat High-Level Corruption

National efforts, of course, are fundamental to our joint efforts to
effectively combat corruption.

Let me give you a brief update on recent U.S. priorities in combating
corruption. At home, we are investigating, prosecuting and convicting corrupt
public officials at all levels of government.

Between 2001 and 2005, the most recent period for which we have data, the
Justice Department charged over 5,749 individuals with public corruption
offenses nationwide and obtained an 85% conviction rate. Many more individuals
have been convicted at the state and local levels.

In addition to preventing, investigating, and prosecuting corruption, we are
working to stem corruption around the world.

Last year, the United States launched an initiative to combat high-level grand
public corruption, or &quot;Kleptocracy.&quot;

With the purpose of internationalizing efforts against kleptocracy, this
initiative seeks to prevent high-level corruption by denying safe haven to
corrupt public officials and their assets and enhancing global capacity to
return stolen assets to the people from whom they were taken.

Our specific objectives are to:

1. launch a coalition of committed partners to trace and recover the proceeds
of grand corruption;

2. vigorously prosecute foreign corruption offenses and forfeit illicitly
acquired assets;

3. deny physical safe haven to corrupt individuals;

4. strengthen multilateral action against the bribery of kleptocrats;

5. facilitate the effective disposition and administration of recovered assets
for the benefit of the citizens of jurisdictions victimized by grand
corruption; and

6. target enhanced capacity to fight high-level corruption.

We know other APEC members are also taking strong anti-corruption actions.
Since we are in Lima, I will single out the example of Peru's leadership in
combating high-level corruption by prosecuting Vladimiro Montesinos and others.

These successful Peruvian prosecutions demonstrate to the world that power is
not unlimited and that when communities mobilize to say &quot;enough of corruption&quot;,
the will of the people can help to check and redress abuses of power and
restore integrity and trust in public institutions.

It is also noteworthy that by creating an interlocking network of
anticorruption entities such as the Controlaria General, the Defensora del
Pueblo (National Ombudsman Office), the newly formed National Anti-Corruption
Office and the judicial system, the Government of Peru is responding
energetically to the will of its people to make a difference in Peru and to
help it become part of the community of integrity within APEC.

Collective Action: The Way Forward in 2008

Looking to 2008, the United States is committed to work with our APEC partners
and others in the international community who are prosecuting the battle
against corruption to effectively implement our leaders commitments and
contribute to a strong and practical agenda for the COSP and implementation of
UNCAC.  We need to keep up our efforts on all fronts, including through the
Financial Action Task Force and the related FATF-style regional bodies to
ensure that we have in place proper regulatory measures to counter money
laundering.

Similarly, global initiatives such as the Stolen Asset Recovery or &quot;STAR,&quot;
unveiled by the World Bank and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime
(UNODC) last month, can help strengthen and expand our collective efforts and
capacity to address these issues.

There is a saying that &quot;a rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; We have confidence that
the APEC is that rising tide, lifting its member economies closer to the
ultimate goal of a region with reduced corruption.

APEC must continue to provide regional and global leadership in fighting
corruption, denying safe haven to corrupt officials and their assets, and
strengthening capacities and international cooperation.

I am confident that it will continue to do so both in the region and at the
January Conference in Indonesia.

Muchísimas Gracias!
