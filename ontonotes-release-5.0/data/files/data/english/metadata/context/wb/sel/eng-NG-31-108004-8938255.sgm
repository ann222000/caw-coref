Ever wonder

why there isn't mouse-flavoured cat food?

who tastes dog food when it has a &quot;new &amp; improved&quot; flavour?

We've always wondered that. Our cat turns up his nose at &quot;deep sea
mousse&quot; and &quot;sizzlin' grill.&quot; He'd much prefer mouse or chipmunk
flavors...and maybe rabbit when he can get it!

(He's just like the kids and gets the same response: &quot;There are always
two choices for dinner: Take it or leave it.&quot; And he'll often walk away
from what's on offer and catch his own alternative. More power to him!)

I did the same thing.  Mom would say &quot;take it or leave it&quot; and I'd go
fix something else.  There is a downside to your kid being almost as
good a cook as Mom.  :)

It would make more sense, certainly - after all, how many cats catch
sea-fish?

Hey, my girl might not actually be able to pull down a deer, but she

Miss Kitty has never been close enough to the ocean to catch sea-fish,
but she knocked the goldfish bowl down often enough that eventually poor
Fishie died of fright.

It's a special vet diet - venison and green peas, because she was
allergic to commercial cat foods.  It's kibble, really not your style, I
wouldn't think.

Makes more sense to kill em and eat 'em than to let them starve to death
and rot.

I agree - Bambi was fiction. Deer are just tall rats that taste very good.

Our deer population waxes and wains according to size of herds, winter
weather, available food etc.  Hopefully man will keep out of it and
Mother Nature will control it, as she always has.

I can vouch for that - our daughter and her &quot;better`alf&quot; are registered deer
stalkers, and regularly make Bambi-burgers and Bambi Sausages!

Talking about &quot;better-alfs&quot; - our son`s getting married to a really lovely
girl exactly a week from now.  His two boys love her, too - in fact we all
do.  Keep your fingers crossed for nice weather for them.
