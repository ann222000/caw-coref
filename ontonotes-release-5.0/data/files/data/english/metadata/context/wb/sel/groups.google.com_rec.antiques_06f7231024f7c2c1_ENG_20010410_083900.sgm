At a recent antique expo, I was purchasing some items from a dealer and had a
little stack of paper items I was perusing. A collector reached for them and I
said &quot;I have picked those out to buy&quot; - response from the collector (hereafter
referred to as TC) &quot;I want to see&quot; and reached out for them. I said &quot;Not right
now, I am still considering these items&quot; and I even smiled nicely, speaking
calmly. TC was FURIOUS, red-faced, complained to the seller and huffed off
throwing over the shoulder &quot;you are SO rude&quot;. Fortunately, the seller said
&quot;don't worry, they don't understand or play by the same rules we do&quot;. But it
was unsettling to have someone become so hostile. Group's comments and
opinions? Thanks, CM

Wow- TC was RUDE!! I think you did the right thing! What are these &quot;rules&quot; anyway?
Are collectors special?

I'd better watch myself this weekend at the big show in Ottawa...

"/> Odd. Seems a world of difference to me between &quot;I have picked those out to
buy&quot; and &quot;I am still considering these items&quot;. In a more formal marketplace,
in the absence of a firm offer to buy, one would have to pay to have right
of first refusal. Here, you seem to think it is yours for free.

As I said, odd.

Perhaps I failed to make myself clear - we were in the middle of a deal and the
last thing I needed was another person exclaiming over the goods....now is
there not a &quot;rule&quot; of etiquette that holds here - would you intrude between two
people who were doing a deal? I think not, Ronnie.

"/> Now, this is going to sound like there's some Antique Market Code, but
it's really just a summary of what's usual around here.

The &quot;rules&quot; generally are that if you pick something up you have a
reasonable time to examine it without someone else horning in with an
offering to buy it. There are limits. You really can't expect to lay
claim to everything in sight with a simple mention that you're &quot;thinking
about it&quot;. You can't set it back down and step away and preserve any
claim to it by saying you'll probably take it but want to think about
it. Around here, if you set it down without a clear statement that
you'll take it, it's up for grabs. If you really want it, you had better
say so, have a hand on it, or have it in arms.

You may, if the dealer's agreeable, say you believe you want that and
that and that if you can inspect them each in turn first, if you don't
mess around too long.

You can't step in while another buyer has something in hand, ask the
price, and offer more, nor can you break into negotiations with an offer
to pay the asking price. It's not an auction. You can, though, if you
think there may be more people interested than you and the first
prospective buyer, lay a sort of secondary claim by announcing that you
will make an offer if the first customer decides against it.

This isn't comment on the related tale. Wasn't there. Didn't see it.
Can't tell if &quot;collector&quot; means a focused collector or just a non-dealer
buyer. In the final analysis, the seller makes the &quot;rules&quot;, even if the
rules don't conform to the usual for that venue. In this case, the
dealer seems to have come down firmly on one side.

At the moment, I happen to have quite a warm feeling for collectors,
particularly collectors of antique lawn sprinklers with deep pockets.

"/> Ditto. Been there put up with that many of times.

Here's where both parties went wrong.

1. No matter where you are at a estate sale, market or any where. If you think
your gonna purchase something. Always get it and keep it in hand.

2. Or put it in a area &amp; tell thr seller you are planning on buying it so they
know to tell people there that is your stuff. Or take a bag, purse or carrier
with you for holding things you think your gonna purchase.

3. If you put back what you think you might purchase, it becomes fair game to
the other person interested.

4. The other person in the collector or other wise waited to see if you were
coming to purchase. They assumed like you did since it wasn't in hand it was
game.

5. Always remember even at any sale there are always more sales out there &amp;
more stuff somewhere else. Not to get into conflict.

YES! I'm a collector, restorer, buyer, seller but not considered a dealer only
becuase of I don't have a tax number I pay my tax when purchasing a item. I
live in the South. I'm in Texas. Us Collector as you so called put it. Have no
set of rules. There are no rules.

If it were me &amp; you at the sale. When you put the item down. I would have told
you it was fair to purchase it myself since you don't have the item in hand.

I don't think the person ment to be rude until you decided to not let them try
to purchse the item themselves since they picked it up.

That means it wasn't in your hands. Yes! I'm reading your post word for word.

If it wasn't put back the other person wouldn't have had the chance to pick it
up. Am I right! YES or NO.

So, I'm in agreement with Ronnie on this one. You keep it in hand &amp; plan on
purchase the conflict would have never happened to begin with.

You decide to purchase &amp; put it back down. The item in question is fair game to
the next person.

You take it up to the register to purchase &amp; put it down and decide against it.
It's still fair game.

You take it with you palnning to purchase pay for it. It's yours.

That's how it works. Once you put it down it's fair game to anyone.

Sincerely Paula Fort Worth Texas. I'm a radio, TV, appliance nut.

Saying I'm going to pursue &amp; purchase without item in hand would make me think
you decided against it.

grabbed them. I explained I was buying them and she got pretty nasty and
refused to give them up. Are you saying I should have just walked away from
that? They weren't in my hands at that one moment. Anyhow, I had to literally
pull the shoes away from her. This business has turned me from a delicate

Good point, Maryann....I didn't think of that and you may have pegged it. I
guess I should have said &quot;rude person&quot;. But in our area, most dealers won't
intrude on another dealer who explains as I did that they are in the midst of a
deal. I didn't mean to start a long thread but was puzzled and exasperated at
the same time by the reaction when I thought I was being nice by the way I
said no. Oh well, time to go forward and forget about it, I'd say.

&gt;Subject: Re: Rude collectors
&gt;Path:

"/> In your deal money had conmince a deal.

So, the other dealer should have respected that. They were rude.

But in this case onthe original post I'm not reading anything about talking to
the seller about a money deal.

So far it is just I was pursing &amp; thinking of purchasing the item. The item
wasn't in hand with a money exchange doing down.

Big difference.

Read my post again. If you have the item in hand &amp; at the register decide
against purchase &amp; put it down it's far game.

As I said tell the seller you plan on purchasing these items &amp; they normally
will watch your stuff as to know one else have a chance to purchase.

Done this any of times.

I don't know where you &amp; the other person are purchasing stuff. But I have
never had a problem with rude people do to the precaustions I take with a
purchase.

Sound like sales in your areas are very aggressive to me.

I've alway taken several precautions when purchasing a item.

1. Keeping in hand or behind the counter by the seller &amp; had them watch my
stuff.

2. Put with the seller &amp; gave them some money on the stuff so no one touches
it.

3. Kept it with me at all times just incase I decide later against the item if
I find something else I need worse. Then can put that item back for someone
else after I decide which one I like better.

4. Always carry a tote bag, big purchase, or have hubby hold the stuff or my
kids. As not to have it put down.

5. Go ahead &amp; purchase the item in question put it away, or behind the sellers
counter or where ever they put purchased items. Then go back for more.

6. This totally aviods conflicts even nasty people who swoop down to grab your
item.

I will admit in a middle of a money deal like you had the other person should
have respected your space &amp; things since you were already in the middle of a
deal. They get ruffed. That's to bad. They should have listened before
reacting. That I will give you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Ashley

"/> Always remember after a money deal is going down. Leave that persons stuff
alone.

People need to listen better to what's going on around them before reacting.

I'm glad Ashley I'm not in your neighborhood I'd be ticking off alot of people.
When a money deal is in progress on a radio I get down right nasty. Whether
it's mine or someone elses &amp; someone steps in to be a pain.

I'm the kinda person they call a bull dog. I will say something to the party
that tries to kill a money deal already in progress.

Never had to do that to anyone at estate sales, thrift shops or anywhere else
yet.

even belong to you. It's put there by the store as a courtesy to all
its customers.

So, if you turn your back or wander off momentarily and someone takes
your cart, do you track them down?

Let's say I have a property for sale. A person expresses a keen interest
and has her agent write up a full-price offer. She writes a check for
3% of the purchase price BUT instructs her agent to hold both the offer
and earnest money check until she can get opinions from several relatives.

Does this person have my property in her &quot;shopping cart&quot;? She may
believe she does, but she has no legal rights vis a vis my property.
I can sell it in the next five minutes to someone offering less than full
price, full price or 145,000 quatloos, if I so desire.

In other words, &quot;dibs&quot; is not a meaningful legal concept if there is
no consideration given. And I don't see any difference if the property

&gt;Really? What a strange belief, especially given that the
&gt;cart doesn't even belong to you. It's put there by the store
&gt;as a courtesy to all its customers.

&gt;So, if you turn your back or wander off momentarily and
&gt;someone takes your cart, do you track them down?

&gt;Let's say I have a property for sale. A person expresses a
&gt;keen interest and has her agent write up a full-price offer.
&gt;She writes a check for 3% of the purchase price BUT
&gt;instructs her agent to hold both the offer and earnest money
&gt;check until she can get opinions from several relatives.

&gt;Does this person have my property in her &quot;shopping cart&quot;?
&gt;She may believe she does, but she has no legal rights vis a
&gt;vis my property. I can sell it in the next five minutes to
&gt;someone offering less than full price, full price or 145,000
&gt;quatloos, if I so desire.

&gt;In other words, &quot;dibs&quot; is not a meaningful legal concept if
&gt;there is no consideration given. And I don't see any difference
&gt;if the property is real estate or a Tiffany mixed metals piece
&gt;from the Aesthetic period.

"/> Hi, Charleen

I know one place where the shopping cart is sacrosanct: our
local thrift stores. I can *fill* my cart with Fiesta, Dick and
Jane books, a $2 painting worth $700 or more, or any of the
myriad other items that other shoppers are looking for --
and guarantee that if I wander away an aisle or two, the
contents of my cart will not be pilfered or disturbed.

And...if anyone dares attempt it, another shopper will stop
them and alert me. We even ooh and ah over someone
else's good fortune. And commiserate on those empty
cart days. It's not real estate, it's not Tiffany....but it's a
strange sport.

&gt;I must admit .. I miss my old shop as well, but then finding good gear these

Bowl (you've heard us discussing it here) when I was in CA. First....I
wondered WHY I had a shop when the MOBS of people are schlupping around at the
fleas. They filled up the parking lots and were getting ticketed when I left
for illegal parking.

Second.....I wanted to CRY when I saw what is now considered &quot;antique&quot; in
California. I seriously doubt there was anything older than 1900 there.

Third....what IS it with painted 1940's furniture? I mean, it was
*everywhere* and it was *selling*!!! &quot;Shabby Chic&quot; and &quot;Martha
Stewart&quot;....aren't those both a bit passe (sorry, I don't have that cute
little accent on my computer like you do.)?

Fourth....any raving I did about vintage clothing you can just forget if you
have been exposed to the Rose Bowl stuff. I've never seen a bigger heap of,
ahem, rags in my life.

had that trouble with a few cowhands. The others have been ever so fine and
kind to me. In fact, I've found myself a new &quot;clock&quot; guy which will be ever
so handy when/if I open my own place someday.
Another thing about being in a mall....you have an instant customer base

couple of weeks have been to dealers.

"/> Hi LF,

Man that scam is an old one, sell some else's stock before you own it ;~))), we had
the same thing going on in Antique Malls up here. A friend of mine, new to the pit
falls of this type of venue was telling me that his stall was practically picked
clean with these &quot;On Holds&quot;. The Lovejoys of the trade would check out his stock,
put on &quot;the holds&quot;, call their customers about &quot; this lovely piece I've just picked
up&quot;. My friend, now a little wiser, only allows 24hr. &quot;holds&quot; with 25%-50% down
except in cases where there has been a long standing business relationship.

Damned if I will! These candlesticks are newly polished and
lacquered seventeenth century push-ups. I want to wave them about this
garage (tag) sale, making collectors jealous. Ahead? Not even.

"/> We don't have much turnover in our store. We have one dealer leaving the end
of the month because the owner asked her to leave. Her merchandise just didn't
fit in with the image he wants for our store. He has a rule that if you put
something in your booth that isn't acceptable, he will put a yellow sticker on
it and you have to remove it. When he told this dealer she had to go, she
asked him if he couldn't just put a yellow sticker on the unacceptable items.
He said he wanted to tell her he didn't have that many yellow stickers!
Although she has put up a &quot;Close Out 25% Off&quot; sign in her booth none of us are
interested in purchasing her Breyer horses or 1930s armoire. Heck, I'm proud
of the customers. She has it marked $185 before the discount and even the
customers aren't buying it.
