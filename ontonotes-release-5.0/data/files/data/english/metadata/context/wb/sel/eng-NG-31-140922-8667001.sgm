For the record I state that the JHS 1982 25 year reunion was a
butt-kicking rock-n-roll good time.  My only disappointment with the
evening was that Kelli Hedges didn't show up for the second night
because I had my nerve up to hit on her.

This weekend provided me the opportunity to laugh harder that I have in
years and I definitely received and gave out more hugs than any other
time in my life.  To be honest, it served as chicken soup for my soul
and it was the most I felt like myself since I returned from Iraq so I
appreciate everyone who took the time to attend.

I wish you all knew how good it made me feel to break bread and hoist a
toast with you; especially after having survived situations where I
didn't even know if I was going to survive through the next five
minutes.

As I was pulling out of town this morning, since I am retired US Army,
served in a few wars- I felt a sense of entitlement; so I burned a fat
one, cranked up the tunes and as I was crossing over the bridge with
Jeffersonville in my rear-view and the open road to my front--- my eyes
filled with tears of joy as I reminisced and felt proud of where it is
that I come from and the people that I know that I am privileged to call
my friends.

My you all live long and prosper.

God Bless-

Jim do you realize what water does to a key board?  After reading such a wonderful testimony, I know a few people had tears falling onto their keyboards, specially Kelly, Dana and Rebecca.  We know what softies they are.

God Bless you as well and again, Thank you and all of the other classmates that have served in our military fighting for our country.

Eric and Jaybee
