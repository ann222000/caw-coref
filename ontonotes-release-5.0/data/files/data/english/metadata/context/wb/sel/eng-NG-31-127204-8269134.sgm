I just returned to my upstate New York home from a cross country vacation by
rail.  I'll have other posts in various newsgroups about aspects of the
trip.  But I wanted to comment about this incident.

We were on the Lake Shore Limited, traveling from Chicago to Schenectady
(the train goes on to New York City) when, just after the Buffalo stop, the
train stopped and two uniformed immigration patrol officers boarded and
walked through the coach class cars asking each person if he or she is an
American citizen.  They did not ask for papers or identification.  I heard
that they did take someone off the train from another car.

I spoke to the conductor about this since it further delayed a train that
was already running 45 minutes late.  The conductor said that it doesn't
happen for every train, but it happens frequently.  He also mentioned that
the officers do not go through the first class sleeper cars.

Legally, I don't think traveling by Amtrak is any different than driving on
highways.  You don't see roadblocks on the nation's interstates (except for
some poorly thought out ones on the interstates leading from Canada and,
presumably, from Mexico).  This train never crossed a border.  And the
officers did not bother with the presumably wealthier sleeper passengers.

I think that at best, this is a huge waste of government resources.  If they
are really looking for illegal aliens, they know where to look:  the work
places where the illegals work for peanuts.  If they are looking for
terrorists, then they should concentrate on the borders and international
airline terminals.

At it's worst, it reeks of countries where you can be stopped at any time
and place and asked to present your papers.

I wonder what the response would have been if I answered &quot;American citizen&quot;
but in a foreign accent.

You must not have travel on any of the interstate highways or US Routes
in the southwest part of the country.  The Border Patrol has numerous
elaborate check points that are manned 24/7.  If you are east bound on
IH 10 from El Paso, there is permanent check point station near Sierra
Blanca that you have to go through.  I have been through at least a half
dozen or more of these permanent facilities while traveling through the
southwestern part of the country.

I do frequently travel on I-87 in northern New York's Adirondack Mountains.
For a while there was a permanent road block about 50 miles south of the
Canadian border...on a blind curve in a very rural area.  After a semi
plowed into a stopped car, killing several, local uproar over this stop
forced the feds to shut it down at least some of the time.  I'm going up
that way tomorrow so I'll see if they have reopened it.

I still think it's dumb.  Protect the borders at the borders.

&gt; If that were the case, they wouldn't have to ask for identification if

I live 6 miles from the Mexican border. The Border Patrol does its job
but illegals do slip through. Many, many of them are caught at
checkpoints along US 281 and US 77. Those checkpoints are located 70+
miles north of the Rio Grande.

The local media reports on the catching of illegal immigrants and drug
shipments at these checkpoints on an almost daily basis.

I suppose I shouldn't compare the southern border with the northern.
Relatively few illegal immigrants come over from Canada.  I rarely hear of
anyone being caught due to checkpoints near the Canadian border (or even at
the border itself).  In fact, the guy with the TB case came across on the
I-87 crossing from Canada into New York State.  He was on a watch list, and
border patrol just waved him through.

The same border patrol treated my family of four, with two teenaged girls,
rather roughly when we came through the same crossing last year.  They
showed us who was boss, but didn't catch someone on a watch list.

Well, this was at the Buffalo stop.  The train runs from Chicago to NYC.
Between Chicago and Syracuse, the only crossings from Canada are over
bridges.

So, why didn't they also check first class?  Why don't they put road blocks
on the Thruway?  Seems to me that they only look at public transportation
since that's what the poor people use.  The real terrorists, though, have
resources.  They by airline tickets.

I had no problems using it and I certainly wouldn't consider

The document Amtrak asks a passengers to carry is a driver's license (or

No, it does not mean a US government issued ID. It means a government
issued photo ID. If the photo ID is issued by the Albanian government
it is a valid. And it does not have to be a passport. It can for
example, be a drivers license issued by the Albanian government.

It is?  I've crossed the US-Canadian border a dozen times in the last few
years, and I've never been able to figure out exactly where it is because
it's just a bunch of trees right up to the road.  I figure it's somewhere
between the respective countries' checkpoints, but they're a quarter mile or
so a part in places.  No clearcutting or even signs to tell you where the
actual border is.  Anyone who cared could easily just walk around the
checkpoints and never be noticed.

What really jerks my chain is that folks on the US side demanded to see my
passport to allow me to _leave_ the US.  They were far more interested in me
than the Canadians, who just waved me through without even opening the
booth's window.

&quot;Government-issued photo ID&quot; means any piece of paper or plastic issued by

It was just a couple guys in uniform standing in the northbound lanes,

they said it was a &quot;courtesy&quot; to make sure people had the papers they'd need

me about why I was going to Canada.

My bet is they were really looking for fugitives trying to leave the
country, and it's a lot easier to catch them on the US side than to hope the
Canadians will nab them and then have to deal with extradition.  Since I've
only crossed at that location once, I don't know if it's a regular thing
there or only on special occasions.

Try hiking up north along the trails from North Cascades National Park in
WA.  Once you get to the border (where there is no checkpoint, being in the
wilderness) there is a very noticeable 20-foot wide clearcut that marks
the border.  You can see it stretching right up the mountain.  Fire up
Google Earth or maps.google.com and explore any forested area along the
border and you'll clearly see it.

I-5 and I-15 both have such facilities built right into the northbound
lanes of the interstates, about 50 mile north of the border in areas where
there are no practical detours off of the interstates.  It is very similar
to a toll plaza, where drivers are forced to slow and pass through a lane
where a border guard can be stationed.  Lately, however, on I-5 (I haven't
used that part of I-15 in a few years), the lanes have been wide open with
no guards in sight.  I suppose they are all deployed along the actual
border.

If they have advance knowledge that someone is trying to sneak through
with a vanload of immigrants, or some other police action is needed, they
can quickly seal the checkpoint, however.

That probably is not completely legal, but I suspect the reason for is
that they don't want the hassle when you try to come back into the U.S.  I
don't think there is any law on the books that requires you to have a
passport or any other kind of permission to LEAVE the U.S.  Entering
another country is a different matter.  I am sure if you made an issue out
of your right to leave the U.S. without a passport, they would wave you
through, while informing the Canadian guards, who would then refuse you
entry.

only means that you need some form of official photo ID (usually a
state-issued driver's license, in the case of US residents) when picking
up your ticket prior to boarding the train.  Probably a British driver's
license would work, but of course a British passport would also do the job.

And, contrary to the other poster's remarks, Amtrak is not in the habit of
demanding ID from its en route passengers.

You must not have gone through one of these Border Patrol check points
before.  All you do is drive up to the Border Patrol officer, lower your
window and he asks if you are a U.S. citizen.  You answer yes while he
looks inside your vehicle to see if there are any other passengers.
Then you tell the officer to have a nice day, raise your window and you

If you have passengers in the vehicle, the officer asks them the same

Read what I said again - I don't think much of the present
system is effective at all. However, covert surveillance,
deep intelligence and random checking is likely, in my
opinion, to be more effective than the sort of nonsense we
see at airports.

Consider the difference between the action taken prior to
9/11 by US authorities, and the pre-emptive action taken
here:
http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/08/news/australia.php
Or the arrests this week.

Not that I'm saying we are necessarily better, maybe we were
just luckier. Also note the preparations for APEC occurring
in Sydney; that experience makes me doubt the wisdom of ever
holding such a conference in a major city in the future.
http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/sydney-security-tightens-for-apec...

Not a good week for tourists to be visiting Sydney if you
aren't attending the conference.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trip.  But I wanted to comment about this incident.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We were on the Lake Shore Limited, traveling from Chicago to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Schenectady
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (the train goes on to New York City) when, just after the Buffalo
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; stop,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; train stopped and two uniformed immigration patrol officers boarded
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; walked through the coach class cars asking each person if he or she is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; American citizen.  They did not ask for papers or identification.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heard
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that they did take someone off the train from another car.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I spoke to the conductor about this since it further delayed a train
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was already running 45 minutes late.  The conductor said that it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happen for every train, but it happens frequently.  He also mentioned
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the officers do not go through the first class sleeper cars.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Legally, I don't think traveling by Amtrak is any different than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; driving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; highways.  You don't see roadblocks on the nation's interstates
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (except
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some poorly thought out ones on the interstates leading from Canada
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; presumably, from Mexico).  This train never crossed a border.  And the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; officers did not bother with the presumably wealthier sleeper
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passengers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You must not have travel on any of the interstate highways or US Routes
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the southwest part of the country.  The Border Patrol has numerous
&gt;&gt; &gt; elaborate check points that are manned 24/7.  If you are east bound on
&gt;&gt; &gt; IH 10 from El Paso, there is permanent check point station near Sierra
&gt;&gt; &gt; Blanca that you have to go through.  I have been through at least a
&gt;&gt; &gt; half
&gt;&gt; &gt; dozen or more of these permanent facilities while traveling through the
&gt;&gt; &gt; southwestern part of the country.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fred Ellis
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; I do frequently travel on I-87 in northern New York's Adirondack
&gt;&gt; Mountains.
&gt;&gt; For a while there was a permanent road block about 50 miles south of the
&gt;&gt; Canadian border...on a blind curve in a very rural area.  After a semi
&gt;&gt; plowed into a stopped car, killing several, local uproar over this stop
&gt;&gt; forced the feds to shut it down at least some of the time.  I'm going up
&gt;&gt; that way tomorrow so I'll see if they have reopened it.

&gt;&gt; I still think it's dumb.  Protect the borders at the borders

&gt; That's a dumb statement.  So you are saying they should not raid
&gt; illegal sweat shops in NYC or LA for illegal immigrants?
">

You just hit the nail on the head.  Where are the illegal immigrants?  They
are on the farms, in the sweat shops, cleaning your houses and keeping your
lawns and gardens.  However, the government really doesn't want to hit too
hard in those locations because we LIKE the cheap labor!  So they do some
token busts here and there just to give the public the illusion that they
are doing their job.  Same with the road, train and bus stops.  It is token.
It is an illusion.  It is purely for show.

We boarded trains at five different locations during our cross country and

boarding, and never asked for it on the train.  They did not ask for a photo
ID at the following locations:

Schenectady, NY (point of origin...although my wife had to show an ID and
sign the tickets when she picked them up)

Malta, Montana
Portland, Oregon
East Glacier Montana.

Only in Chicago when changing trains.

Also, I frequently take Amtrak to and from New York City and have never been
asked for an ID.
