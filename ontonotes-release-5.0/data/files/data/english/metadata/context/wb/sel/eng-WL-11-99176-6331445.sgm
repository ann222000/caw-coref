Normal Solomon has a great facility for turning a phrase: We can blame Bush all we want -- and he does hold the reins right now -- but his main enablers these days are the fastidious public servants in Congress. They keep preparing the hay, freshening the water, oiling the saddle, even while criticizing the inappropriately jocular rider. And when the band plays "Hail to the Jockey," most of the grown-up stable boys and girls can't help saluting.

The key problem right now isn't the headless jockey. It's the stable hands who keep feeding the horse he rode in on.

Let's go one step farther:
The so-called "owners" of the enterprise, who "hire" the stable hands and believe the stable hands are working for them (THE PEOPLE) and the cheerleaders who tell the owners, as the thieving stable hands walk away with all the feed, that "the system is working." (THE FOURTH ESTATE).
And how could we forget the god-like overseers of the whole spiel, THE CORPORATIONS.
Wake up everybody? Sssshhhhh! As it says in the movies: SILENCE IS GOLDEN.

At some point the American people have to get off their asses and end this war. As Michael Parenti has said numerous times: When the people are ready to lead, the leaders will follow. It's up to us. Let's keep organizing and agitating. We can do it.

This was also posted on The Huffington Post. I wrote that I agreed with a commenter who inquired "What are the Democrats waiting for?" They are, allegedly, supposed to be the voice of the people.

The commenter's question reminds me of the classic anti-war film The Train [1964], when, as the war is winding down, the French resistance is waiting for the Allies to show up before they march onto Paris to liberate that city. Burt Lancaster cries out "Where are the Allies?" Likewise, why are the Democrats not speaking out in a unified voice against the escalation, speaking out in favor of cutting off the funding, demanding that those troops be withdrawn from that quagmire as rapidly as possible? Where are the Democrats? It is almost as if the Republicans are still in power. It is way past the point that these pusillanimous Democrats should beseech the Wizard for a large heaping of courage.
