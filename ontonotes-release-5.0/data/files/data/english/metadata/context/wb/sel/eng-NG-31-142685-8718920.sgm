&quot;James K. Polk Where Are You When We Need You, We Are Being Governed By
Idiots&quot;

The invasion by illegal aliens is not the only dire threat that
confronts us today, but other than the fascist government that
deliberately enables it, it is the most critical threat to face this
nation in its history, and that includes two world wars, the fighting of
which never reached our shores.

The invasion of the nation proper by millions of illegal aliens can no
longer be considered to be only a nuisance or a situation that we can
withstand with little consequence. We simply cannot continue to ignore
or countenance the hoards of law-breaking invaders that pour across our
borders with impunity and with nothing in the way of containment by our
government.

Our politicians should be dragged from the chambers that they profane by
their very presence and be scourged and whipped as traitors to the
nation and to the people who they purportedly represent.

All but a handful of Senators and entirely too many Congressional
Representatives have encouraged and ignored the festering disease of
illegal border crashing and allowed it to burgeon into an insidious
malignancy, which rots away the foundations of the nation and threatens
the people of this nation with a full fledged insurrection by a
non-indigenous people whose stated purpose is to pave the way for the
overthrow of the nation, to institutionalize a socialistic order, and to
banish entirely those European and African descendents who by their
sweat and ingenuity built the nation and defended its principles through
two world wars.

I have long maintained, and still do, that if for no other reason than
to head off the possibility of such an overthrow, that every last man,
woman, and child, who are in this country by a means other than lawful
immigration, must be purged from the country by deportation. I have also
maintained that despite what George W. Bush, the witting head of this
increasingly militant insurgency, tells you we have everything to fear
from the Latin-American hoards that have illegally invaded our borders
and laid siege to our institutions and our society.

One has only to look to the statements by militant Hispanic groups in
this country and the pronouncements of equally militant leaders of
Latin-American countries to ascertain that these have designs on the
United States as a place to provide living space for their masses.

With avaricious desire they contemplate the appropriation of the
infrastructure and the resources of a nation built upon the sweat and
blood of the millions of Euro-Americans and Afro-Americans who
established and populated this nation. Like Hitler who looked to Poland
and Czechoslovakia for Lebensraum (Lining Space) for the German people
these suckers covet the United States in likewise fashion.

I once wrote a piece in which I contended that not only is the huge and
ever growing number of illegal aliens - who may call themselves by
various names such as Latinos, Mestizos, Hispanics, Nican Tlaca, or
whatever - in this country a threat to our economic well-being and
social stability, it also constitutes a precursor to a military invasion
of the country from the south. As previously stated these people and
these governments have no love for the United States, they have only an
abiding hatred for, and a jealousy of, our people, and an insatiable
lust for that which belongs to us.

The only friend that we have upon the North American continent is
Canada; the letters that I receive from our neighbors to the north
indicates such. If, or when, the internal stability of this nation
dissipates to a point where our military formidability can no longer
assure the inviolability of our borders, a situation not too far fetched
in view of current events, we can expect a military invasion across our
southern borders, and the invaders will have the advantage of thirty to
forty million or more well placed saboteurs and guerilla insurgents.

The last time that I laid out this scenario in writing, some idiot wrote
and said, &quot;Hahahahahohohoheeheehee what a laugh to think that these
ignorant countries could prevail against our invincible military, dream
on.&quot; The only ignorance that I could perceive was that of the person who
wrote that letter. No military is invincible; if history has taught us
anything it has taught us that. The Russians thought that they were
invincible when they invaded Afghanistan, and they were completely
outfought demoralized and humiliated by the rag tag guerilla fighters
who prevailed against them, and think of the fact that our supposedly
invincible military forces have not been able to diminish or eliminate
the presence of the militant insurgents in Iraq and the middle-east.

Now envision, if you will, what would have been the result if some
thirty to forty million well placed American and English foot-loose and
unrestrained internal agents, who were loyal to the countries of their
origin, had been allowed to infiltrate pre-war Germany. Of course we
know that Adolph Hitler, unlike the cretin who serves as our
commander-in-chief, had more brains than to allow this to happen, but
for the sake of argument let's assume that these foreign agents had been
allowed to infiltrate to the extent that the United States has been
infiltrated by foreign nationals and I believe that you will concede
that these millions could have created an internal havoc, which would
have shortened the war in our favor considerably.

I used to think that the people of this country had little discernment
and even less God-given common sense, and that they were a hopeless
cause. I have altered that opinion to a great extent given the fact that
eighty percent of the people have demonstrated that they do have a
capacity for common sense and that they recognize the dire consequence
of the invasion of millions of illegal aliens.

To the politically correct who think that I use the term alien to cause
my readers to equate these invaders with the grotesque caricatures of
space invaders, you are right. Since I am not politically correct it
bothers me not to do so. It is the abysmally ignorant minions of our
government who have reached the absolute ultimate in stupidity and who
have demonstrated a lack of lucidity and the grievously greedy, grasping
and predatory people in high places who wish to surrender the nation to
selfish causes that have earned my detestation. I'm talking about those
in this country who would sacrifice their mother for a dirty dollar.

In other words those who sit upon their thinking apparatus and lust
after the god of money. In case I have not made myself absolutely clear
in this regard, I include in this group the corporations, big business
moguls, some, but not all, trade unionists, the Chamber of Commerce on
both the national and state levels, and last, but not least, the
politically correct do-gooders who invariably champion wrong causes and
do their level best to suppress the freedoms of their neighbors.

Anyone who would sacrifice the lives and well-being of his, or her,
fellow citizens for filthy lucre or social expediency is corrupt of mind
and soul and has no worth or value to the nation. They just take up
space and breathe air that should be reserved for selfless servants of
the human race.

It is sink or swim time for this nation. Illegal parasites are tied to
this nation like a dead weight and are pulling us into the depths of a
sea of destruction and strangulating a once vibrant society. The
economic stress is overwhelming, the deterioration is fearful, and the
transformation of our culture to that of a third-world nation is
disheartening. The lives of every last citizen of the nation has been
jeopardized by these invaders, that the criminal miscreants from among
the thirty million illegal invaders have taken the lives of forty-two
thousand lawful and peace abiding United States citizens points up the
monstrousness of this deliberately countenanced invasion.

The president and every last one of the demonically led people,
heretofore delineated, who have enabled these killers will stand to
account for every single life that has been sacrificed to their greed
and their deviancy of mind.

The solution is simple. When I was a youth I would be required to assist
my Dad who was a mechanic. Often times while toiling in his shop he
would, being too engaged in his work to leave it, send me to the work
bench for a specific tool. It seems that invariably I would be unable to
locate the tool that he would need, and I would exclaim, &quot;Dad, I can't
find it.&quot; He would then disengage himself from the task at hand and walk
to the workbench, pick up the tool, and then say to me, &quot;If it had been
a snake it would have bit you.&quot; It occurs to me that we have a similar
situation in regard to the need of a tool to remove from our midst these
destructive invaders.

The tool is fully in view and accessible; that tool is deportation. The
politicians fume, dawdle, pontificate and procrastinate. They huff and
puff about finding the right solution, when that solution is at hand and
has been all along, if it had been a snake it would have bit them.

Reliable estimates of the annual cost to American taxpayers to sustain
and provide for the welfare of these criminal invaders is, $338.3
billion dollars annually. This is the on-going cost of the coddling of
these law-breakers, and it increases incrementally as untold numbers of
additional aliens crash our borders daily to join the unholy flock
already in the country. The politicians, and the idiots in the media who
parrot them, pee and moan that a one-time cost of $230 billion dollars
for the deportation of the entirety of this parasitic clump is
prohibitive.

One has to wonder where these geniuses received their mathematical
prowess. It must have been garnered in the same public school

Well We need all people that believe
that we need a change, that NAFT is no good, that the superhighway is no
good,
that Illegal Aliens are not good, that Open borders are no good
to join numbersusa.com, firesociety.org, grassfire.org
and tel all their friends that also believe in the above to join those
website and to sign the peitions
and faxes (which all are free other then taking a little time)
and that is the way to get things done. We can sit here all day long
everyday
on this newsgroup and complain but it won't go too far.

&gt; fellow citizens for filthy lucre or social expediency is corrupt of mind
&gt; and soul and has no worth or value to the nation. They just take up
&gt; space and breathe air that should be reserved for selfless servants of
&gt; the human race.

&gt; It is sink or swim time for this nation. Illegal parasites are tied to
&gt; this nation like a dead weight and are pulling us into the depths of a
&gt; sea of destruction and strangulating a once vibrant society. The
&gt; economic stress is overwhelming, the deterioration is fearful, and the
&gt; transformation of our culture to that of a third-world nation is
&gt; disheartening. The lives of every last citizen of the nation has been
&gt; jeopardized by these invaders, that the criminal miscreants from among
&gt; the thirty million illegal invaders have taken the lives of forty-two
&gt; thousand lawful and peace abiding United States citizens points up the
&gt; monstrousness of this deliberately countenanced invasion.

&gt; The president and every last one of the demonically led people,
&gt; heretofore delineated, who have enabled these killers will stand to
&gt; account for every single life that has been sacrificed to their greed
&gt; and their deviancy of mind.

&gt; The solution is simple. When I was a youth I would be required to assist
&gt; my Dad who was a mechanic. Often times while toiling in his shop he
&gt; would, being too engaged in his work to leave it, send me to the work
&gt; bench for a specific tool. It seems that invariably I would be unable to
&gt; locate the tool that he would need, and I would exclaim, &quot;Dad, I can't
&gt; find it.&quot; He would then disengage himself from the task at hand and walk
&gt; to the workbench, pick up the tool, and then say to me, &quot;If it had been
&gt; a snake it would have bit you.&quot; It occurs to me that we have a similar
&gt; situation in regard to the need of a tool to remove from our midst these
&gt; destructive invaders.

&gt; The tool is fully in view and accessible; that tool is deportation. The
&gt; politicians fume, dawdle, pontificate and procrastinate. They huff and
&gt; puff about finding the right solution, when that solution is at hand and
&gt; has been all along, if it had been a snake it would have bit them.

&gt; Reliable estimates of the annual cost to American taxpayers to sustain
&gt; and provide for the welfare of these criminal invaders is, $338.3
&gt; billion dollars annually. This is the on-going cost of the coddling of
&gt; these law-breakers, and it increases incrementally as untold numbers of
&gt; additional aliens crash our borders daily to join the unholy flock
