In the news article below on the CBS reality show Kid Nation, the
reporter writes that a New Mexico Labor Department inspector was not
allowed on the production site and he left, doing nothing.  Civil
servants like that inspector are kept on a pretty tight leash, they
have to account for their time.  Further, the inspector did not just
wander onto the set, he or she got orders to check out the Bonanza
Creek movie ranch, which is off the beaten path.

Telling the inspector to buzz off would normally mean a visit from
more inspectors and maybe their supervisor.  Unless someone at CBS
went to the top of New Mexico's government, maybe even to Governor
Bill Richardson's office, to quash any child labor investigation.
Richardson is trying to get more movies and TV shows made in New
Mexico to help the state's economy.  If the Richardson administration
shielded the producers of Kid Nation, allowing them to skirt school
truancy regulations, that won't do much good to Richardson's
Presidential campaign.

A CBS Reality Show Draws a Claim of Possible Child Abuse
By Edward Wyatt, New York Times

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/arts/television/18kid.html?ei=5090&amp;...

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17 - The ads promoting &quot;Kid Nation,&quot; a new reality
show coming to CBS next month, extol the incredible experience of a
group of 40 children, ages 8 to 15, who built a sort of idealistic
society in a New Mexico ghost town, free of adults.

For 40 days the children cooked their own meals, cleaned their own
outhouses, formed a government and ran their own businesses, all
without adult intervention or participation.

To at least one parent of a participant, who wrote a letter of
complaint to New Mexico state officials after the show had completed
production, the experience bordered on abuse and neglect. Several
children required medical attention after drinking bleach that had
been left in an unmarked soda bottle, according to both the parent and
CBS. One 11-year-old girl burned her face with splattered grease while
cooking.

The children were made to haul wagons loaded with supplies for more
than a mile through the New Mexico countryside, and they worked long
hours - &quot;from the crack of dawn when the rooster started crowing&quot;
until at least 9:30 p.m., according to Taylor, a 10-year-old from
Sylvester, Ga., who was made available by CBS to respond to questions
about conditions on the set.

Taylor and her mother, and another participant and his mother, all
spoke enthusiastically about the show and said they believed the
conditions on the set were adequate. But Divad, an 11-year-old girl
from Fayetteville, Ga., whose mother wrote the letter of complaint and
who was burned with hot grease while cooking, said she would not
repeat the experience. She said there was no adult supervision of the
cooking operation when she was hurt, although there often was an adult
&quot;chef&quot; present in the kitchen.

Her mother, Janis Miles, declined to speak to a reporter.

A New Mexico official whose department oversees licensing of
congregant child-care settings said in an interview that the project
almost assuredly violated state laws requiring facilities that house
children be reviewed and licensed.

The official, Romaine Serna, public information officer for the New
Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, said Friday that CBS
had never contacted the agency. If the department had known of the
parent's allegations when the incidents occurred, she said, &quot;We would
have responded and would have assured the children's safety.&quot;

CBS officials say they broke no laws. &quot;We feel very comfortable that
this was appropriate from a legal point of view,&quot; Ghen
Maynard, the executive vice president for alternative programming at
CBS, said in an interview Friday.

Jonathan Anschell, who oversees CBS's West Coast legal office, said
that a state labor department inspector visited the set of the show
unannounced during the production. But Carlos Castaneda, a spokesman
for the state labor department, now known as the Department of
Workforce Solutions, said that the inspector was not allowed on the
site and left without inspecting anything.

Mr. Anschell said that after the visit from the labor department
inspector, the network contacted the attorney general's office about
its program but was never advised that it was not in compliance with
the law.

The question of how CBS accomplished the feat of taking 40 young
children into the New Mexico desert for nearly six weeks during the
middle of the school year, allowing them almost no contact with their
parents, in order to produce a television show has attracted
attention. The network has heavily promoted &quot;Kid Nation,&quot; which
executives are hoping will be one of its breakout hits this fall.

Almost from the time CBS announced the concept in May, doubts have
grown about whether its actions skirted state or federal laws
regarding child welfare and child labor. The show's executive producer
defended the project in a heated session with television writers in
Beverly Hills last month, but the previously undisclosed allegations
of neglect raise questions about how the experience was structured.

It also raises questions about the still-growing genre of reality
shows, or unscripted programming as it is known in Hollywood.
As reality producers have been forced to reach further to invent
something new or exciting, many shows have apparently left reality
behind. The Discovery Channel last month said it would re-edit some
episodes of &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot; after a British television network reported
that the show's star, adventurer Bear Grylls, was staying in a hotel
on some nights when the show depicted him sleeping in the wild.

The Oxygen cable network heavily promoted a reality show that featured
the actress Tori Spelling investing her inheritance from her
television producer father, Aaron Spelling, in a bed and breakfast
that she was to run with her husband, only to have it later revealed
that she never actually bought the property. A lawsuit filed in New
York last month charged Gordon Ramsey, star of the upcoming reality
show &quot;Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares,&quot; with faking scenes, including
hiring actors to pose as customers. The parties were ordered to go to
arbitration by a Manhattan judge.

Until &quot;Kid Nation,&quot; no reality show had focused on taking a group of
children from their homes and placing them in unknown situations,
forced to deal with whatever arises and recording the results.

Just days after the shooting of &quot;Kid Nation&quot; ended, an anonymous
letter was sent to the New Mexico governor's office, the attorney
general's office and the sheriff of Santa Fe County, spelling out the
bleach-drinking incident and other potentially harmful circumstances.
That was followed three weeks later by a letter from Ms. Miles, the
parent of Divad, that detailed many of the same incidents and
injuries.

The program, which is scheduled to have its premiere on Sept. 19, was
produced on the Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch, located on several thousand
acres about eight miles south of Santa Fe. The ranch contains several
dozen buildings in various locations, most of which were built for the
filming and production of movies like &quot;Into the West&quot; and &quot;Silverado.&quot;

Tom Forman, the executive producer of the show, told television
writers last month at the semi-annual Television Critics Association
press tour that New Mexico had been chosen because Bonanza Creek
offered a unique setting. New Mexico also had no specific regulations
concerning the use of child actors in television and film production,
which many states, including California and New York, do have.

Though the children spent six weeks away from school in April and May,
no tutors were present on the set. Though many states limit the number
of hours children can work a day on television productions, Mr. Forman
said the children set their own hours.

Ms. Miles's letter, which requested an investigation into issues of
child abuse, neglect and endangerment, was sent to her local sheriff's
office, which forwarded it to the sheriff's office in Santa Fe County.
Greg Solano, the Santa Fe sheriff, said he had investigated the
allegations but found no criminal activity. He sent the letter along
to civil authorities.

Ms. Serna's office was among those that received the information, but
by that time the production was already packed up and gone from New
Mexico. &quot;This type of setting, with 40 kids away from their parents
for an extended time, would have required some notice and work prior
to actually bringing the children into the state,&quot; she said.

Mr. Anschell of CBS disputed that, saying that the network's
correspondence with the attorney general's office produced nothing
except a warning that as of June 15, state law had been changed to
limit the number of hours that children can be on the set of a
television production.

Mr. Anschell also said that state labor laws did not apply. &quot;The
children were not employed under the legal definition,&quot; he said. &quot;They
were not receiving set wages for performing specific tasks or working
specific hours.&quot;

But the parents were told before the children left to go to the set
that they would receive a $5,000 stipend for their participation. The
children also had the opportunity to earn a gold star that was given
at the end of each episode - or roughly every three days of filming -
that at the end of the session could be turned in for a $20,000 check.
In addition, the children were assigned tasks and

CBS ought to have learned from past experience that reality show contestants
are real people and not objects...one of the 'PirateMaster' contestants
recently committed suicide (Cheryl) soon after leaving the show...and one of
Fox's 'Hell's Kitchen' contestants from last year's season two was found
dead in May (Rachel Brown).  A Mark Burnett boxing reality contestant did a
suicide a few years back also...and a foreign version of 'Survivor'
generated yet another suicide a while back.  Some adult contestants come out
of the reality-show experience deeply disturbed and physically/emotionally
battered (just look at the online reruns of last season's
'Survivor')--reality shows are not for kids.  In past years, one 'Survivor'
was burned in the face, another was whacked with a machete, and the
Machiavellian backstabbing nature of 'Survivor' is too much for
psychologically frail folks, etc...this 'Kids Nation' show looks as bad.
For strong-willed and athletic adult contestants who know what they are
getting into, the reality shows can be a rewarding experience, but for most
normal folks, it's as tough as joining the Marines.

Corporations view people as capital to be used for the generation of
profit...and nothing more.  The use of kids in a hard-core reality series
such as this one is a disgrace and ought to be banned.

Amazing Race was bumped for this crap...TAR was a class act amongst reality

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group of 40 children, ages 8 to 15, who built a sort of idealistic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; society in a New Mexico ghost town, free of adults.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For 40 days the children cooked their own meals, cleaned their own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outhouses, formed a government and ran their own businesses, all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without adult intervention or participation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To at least one parent of a participant, who wrote a letter of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complaint to New Mexico state officials after the show had completed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production, the experience bordered on abuse and neglect. Several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; children required medical attention after drinking bleach that had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been left in an unmarked soda bottle, according to both the parent and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CBS. One 11-year-old girl burned her face with splattered grease while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cooking.
&gt;&gt;&gt; CBS ought to have learned from past experience that reality show contestants
&gt;&gt;&gt; are real people and not objects...one of the 'PirateMaster' contestants
&gt;&gt;&gt; recently committed suicide (Cheryl) soon after leaving the show...and one of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fox's 'Hell's Kitchen' contestants from last year's season two was found
&gt;&gt;&gt; dead in May (Rachel Brown).  A Mark Burnett boxing reality contestant did a
&gt;&gt;&gt; suicide a few years back also...and a foreign version of 'Survivor'
&gt;&gt;&gt; generated yet another suicide a while back.  Some adult contestants come out
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the reality-show experience deeply disturbed and physically/emotionally
&gt;&gt;&gt; battered (just look at the online reruns of last season's
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Survivor')--reality shows are not for kids.  In past years, one 'Survivor'
&gt;&gt;&gt; was burned in the face, another was whacked with a machete, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Machiavellian backstabbing nature of 'Survivor' is too much for
&gt;&gt;&gt; psychologically frail folks, etc...this 'Kids Nation' show looks as bad.
&gt;&gt;&gt; For strong-willed and athletic adult contestants who know what they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; getting into, the reality shows can be a rewarding experience, but for most
&gt;&gt;&gt; normal folks, it's as tough as joining the Marines.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporations view people as capital to be used for
&gt;&gt; This is not, of course, about the eeeeeeeevil
&gt;&gt; corporations (the lunatic left's favorite bogeyman.)
&gt;&gt; This is about the liberal icon CBS getting special
&gt;&gt; treatment from a Democratic administration.

&gt; So then you don't think CBS is incorporated.
">

You're a fuckwit.

CBS being a corporation is irrelevant.  The left's
fanatical obsession with &quot;the corporations&quot; as the
eeeeeeeeevil bogeyman is a big part of why the left is
an impotent laughingstock.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the news article below on the CBS reality show Kid
&gt; Nation, the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reporter writes that a New Mexico Labor Department
&gt; inspector was not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowed on the production site and he left, doing
&gt; nothing.  Civil
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; servants like that inspector are kept on a pretty tight
&gt; leash, they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to account for their time.  Further, the inspector
&gt; did not just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wander onto the set, he or she got orders to check out
&gt; the Bonanza
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Creek movie ranch, which is off the beaten path.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling the inspector to buzz off would normally mean a
&gt; visit from
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more inspectors and maybe their supervisor.  Unless
&gt; someone at CBS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; went to the top of New Mexico's government, maybe even
&gt; to Governor
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill Richardson's office, to quash any child labor
&gt; investigation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Richardson is trying to get more movies and TV shows
&gt; made in New
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mexico to help the state's economy.  If the Richardson
&gt; administration
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shielded the producers of Kid Nation, allowing them to
&gt; skirt school
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; truancy regulations, that won't do much good to
&gt; Richardson's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Presidential campaign.

&gt; For 40 days the children cooked their own meals, cleaned their own

&gt; To at least one parent of a participant, who wrote a letter of

&gt; The children were made to haul wagons loaded with supplies for more

&gt; until at least 9:30 p.m., according to Taylor, a 10-year-old from
&gt; Sylvester, Ga., who was made available by CBS to respond to questions
&gt; about conditions on the set.

&gt; Taylor and her mother, and another participant and his mother, all

&gt; who was burned with hot grease while cooking, said she would not
&gt; repeat the experience. She said there was no adult supervision of the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In the news article below on the CBS reality show Kid Nation, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reporter writes that a New Mexico Labor Department inspector was not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; allowed on the production site and he left, doing nothing.  Civil
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; servants like that inspector are kept on a pretty tight leash, they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have to account for their time.  Further, the inspector did not just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wander onto the set, he or she got orders to check out the Bonanza
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Creek movie ranch, which is off the beaten path.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Telling the inspector to buzz off would normally mean a visit from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more inspectors and maybe their supervisor.  Unless someone at CBS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; went to the top of New Mexico's government, maybe even to Governor
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Bill Richardson's office, to quash any child labor investigation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Richardson is trying to get more movies and TV shows made in New
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Mexico to help the state's economy.  If the Richardson administration
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; shielded the producers of Kid Nation, allowing them to skirt school
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; truancy regulations, that won't do much good to Richardson's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Presidential campaign.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;From New York Times article: Jonathan Anschell, who oversees CBS's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; West Coast legal office, said that a state labor department inspector
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; visited the set of the show unannounced during the production. But
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Carlos Castaneda, a spokesman for the state labor department, now
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; known as the Department of Workforce Solutions, said that the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A CBS Reality Show Draws a Claim of Possible Child Abuse
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; By Edward Wyatt, New York Times

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/arts/television/18kid.html?ei=5090&amp; ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17 - The ads promoting &quot;Kid Nation,&quot; a new reality
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; show coming to CBS next month, extol the incredible experience of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; group of 40 children, ages 8 to 15, who built a sort of idealistic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; society in a New Mexico ghost town, free of adults.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; For 40 days the children cooked their own meals, cleaned their own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; outhouses, formed a government and ran their own businesses, all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; without adult intervention or participation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To at least one parent of a participant, who wrote a letter of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; complaint to New Mexico state officials after the show had completed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; production, the experience bordered on abuse and neglect. Several
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children required medical attention after drinking bleach that had
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; been left in an unmarked soda bottle, according to both the parent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; CBS. One 11-year-old girl burned her face with splattered grease
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; while
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cooking.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; CBS ought to have learned from past experience that reality show
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; contestants are real people and not objects...one of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'PirateMaster'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; contestants recently committed suicide (Cheryl) soon after leaving the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show...and one of Fox's 'Hell's Kitchen' contestants from last year's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; season two was found dead in May (Rachel Brown).  A Mark Burnett
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; boxing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reality contestant did a suicide a few years back also...and a foreign
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; version of 'Survivor' generated yet another suicide a while back.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adult contestants come out of the reality-show experience deeply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disturbed and physically/emotionally battered (just look at the online
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reruns of last season's 'Survivor')--reality shows are not for kids.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; past years, one 'Survivor' was burned in the face, another was whacked
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a machete, and the Machiavellian backstabbing nature of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'Survivor'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is too much for psychologically frail folks, etc...this 'Kids Nation'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show looks as bad. For strong-willed and athletic adult contestants
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; know what they are getting into, the reality shows can be a rewarding
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience, but for most normal folks, it's as tough as joining the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marines.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Corporations view people as capital to be used for

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is not, of course, about the eeeeeeeevil corporations (the lunatic
&gt;&gt; &gt; left's favorite bogeyman.)

&gt;&gt; The left does not say that corporations are evil per se, any more than a
&gt;&gt; Canoza-eating shark is evil per se.

&gt; Actually, the majority of leftists /do/ speak and act as if they
&gt; believe business - that's what they really mean by &quot;the corporations&quot;
&gt; - is eeeeeevil.  This is consistent with their overall anti-private
&gt; property mentality.

&quot;Anti-private property mentality???&quot;  Parroting rightwing talk radio these
days?

Can't you speak your own mind?

What &quot;anti-private property mentality&quot; are you going on about?  The Left
just wants you lazy Corporatist-Fascists to cease buying off our public
officials...and to take on minimal responsibility for your actions...and to
let the Producing Working Class get its fair share of the Economic Pie.  As
a self-professed economist, why can't you see that it's the lazy Corporatist
Investor classes who parasitically feed off the backs of the Producing
Working Class?  Why don't you people learn to do a day's work for a change?

Do you Corporatist types want to continue to exist as parasites off the
Producing Working Class forever???  It's time you people contributed your
fair share...and not continue to beg the government for more Corporate
Welfare handouts, you feeder off the Corporate Nanny State.  Do you expect
Bernanke forever to give you Corporatist types a taxpayer-funded break every
time you screw up?

NBC, ABC, etc. even air the same news stories at the same time...the same

You're not the only one to cower submissively under the Corporate whip--even
the Dems are their de-facto slaves...that's why we're still in Iraq.

Nothing cliche about it...workers produce, lazy capitalist investors feed
off production by the workers...that's parasitism.

Let's face it, you want a system that supports Lazy Corporate Investor
Parasites at the expense of Honest Producer-Class Workers.  And, the
propaganda package for that system is taught in schools as 'Economics,'
which you claim as your stock and trade.

Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the confidence
trickster's way of brainwashing the intelligentsia into believing the Great
Capitalist Scam: robbing the Producing Working Class out of what's rightly
theirs for the benefit of the Lazy Parasitical Corporate Investor Class.

Economics is the religion of the Parasitical Capitalist Feeder--that's you,
son.  If you sally forth someday to learn what it is to really produce
something through your own labor, you might understand why workers are
entitled to their fair share of the economic pie.

Let them who works, get.

At least those kids on Kid Nation are better off then the Chinese kids
who were kidnapped and sold into slavery ($65 each was the going rate)
to work in brickyards in Shanxi province.  Most of those bricks were
probably heading toward Beijing for Summer Olympic construction
projects.

There was one vile story, someone robbed a kid's train ticket, a woman
came up and said she would help him, and she sold him to a brickyard
owner.  Kidnapping these kids was probably a team effort: a spotter
checking for cognitively disabled  travellers or children alone, a
thief to grab the person's money and tickets and a helpful citizen to
lure the person into the fenced and guarded brickyard prison.   The
People's Public Security Bureau, which monitors Internet traffic so
tightly that if you send an e-mail from a Chinese cyber cafe in
Shanghai that includes the word Falun Gung, police will be in that
cafe in minutes, never did find any of the hundreds of missing kids
for months, even after mass protests by the parents of the missing
children.  These enslaved kids were in plain sight to government
inspectors, either paid off or ordered not to interfere with the Party
bosses brickyards.  A real workers' paradise over there.

Nope.  Those people all are measurably poorer in terms
of purchasing power parity, with the exception of a
couple of inconsequential places like Liechtenstein.
Their economies are all stagnant, and the two big
reasons are unsustainable social welfare spending and
absurdly rigid labor markets, in which redundant
workers cannot be fired.  It is paradoxical only to
economics-illiterate dunderheads like you, but
increasing the ease with which workers can be fired
creates more, not less, overall job security.

&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be capital.
&gt;&gt; And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce and not have it
&gt;&gt; leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.
&gt;&gt; I know that the left-wing Social Democracies of Europe provide a better way
&gt;&gt; of life for the Producer-Worker--how's that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports
&gt;&gt;&gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens better
&gt;&gt; overall.  Most Americans are not doing well...only a few at the top do well
&gt;&gt; materially.  Our system is very poor at creating wealth for most citizens,
&gt;&gt; whether you slander them as lazy or not...American workers are not lazy,
&gt;&gt; they're just poorly paid.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism is predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt; on private enterprise and private property.
&gt;&gt; Most of the private property the Capitalists now own was once public
&gt;&gt; property--it was stolen from the public via crony connections and sheer
&gt;&gt; corruption...that's how the railroads got their land.  It's easy to leverage
&gt;&gt; yourself into capital when you've got friends in high places...that's not
&gt;&gt; enterprise, it's corruption.

&gt;&gt; Capitalism, as practised in the U.S., is not true capitalism anyhow...it is
&gt;&gt; a system of favoritism and corruption...them that has, gits.  The Corporate
&gt;&gt; Welfare Mess (&gt;$200 billion a year in handouts to the very rich) is
&gt;&gt; well-known to all but you. There's very little true competition--monopolies
&gt;&gt; and near monopolies are common...that's why gas is at an all-time high.  The
&gt;&gt; same group of well-heeled cronies flock from one corporate board to
&gt;&gt; another...that's not true competition, now is it?  American Capitalists are
&gt;&gt; afraid of full-blown laissez-faire capitalism--they'd never survive it,
&gt;&gt; because the Workers would have few barriers toward becoming Entrepreneurs
&gt;&gt; themselves...it's always the most conservative types in a town who fight
&gt;&gt; most vociferously for zoning regulations, for example--if your unemployed
&gt;&gt; next-door neighbor opened a hot dog stand at his house, I'll bet you'd be
&gt;&gt; the first to scream 'zoning violation' at him.

&gt;&gt; Private enterprise is a good thing, but those who are successful ought to
&gt;&gt; pay those workers who made them successful a proper wage, adhere to the law
&gt;&gt; like anyone else, and these successful entreprenuers oughtn't to use their
&gt;&gt; cash to buy favorable policy decisions from the public's elected officials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the confidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trickster's way of brainwashing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; You demonstrate that you don't know what the fuck you're talking
&gt;&gt;&gt; about, regarding anything, and that YOU are the one brainwashed by a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of leftover 60s potheads.
&gt;&gt; Not quite right...I do quite well financially as a programmer...and I like
&gt;&gt; my  corporate-made can of Pepsi just as anyone else does.  All I want is for
&gt;&gt; corporations to stop exerting undue influence over our government, pay their
&gt;&gt; fair share of taxes, and, to earn the privilege of access to our Esteemed
&gt;&gt; American Work Force, pay American Workers proper wages and benefits.  That
&gt;&gt; leaves a heap of profits for the true entrepreneur...true entrepreneurship
&gt;&gt; amongst our current crop of business leaders is dead because they are
&gt;&gt; getting a free ride to riches.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxism is dead.  Get over it.  It and all other forms of socialist
&gt;&gt;&gt; dogma were not based in reality, and have been discarded.  You want to
&gt;&gt;&gt; spout that shit, feel free to do so - but understand that you are self-
&gt;&gt;&gt; marginalized by doing so.  You're powerless, you work to ensure that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you remain that way, and productive people everywhere laugh at you and
&gt;&gt;&gt; scorn you.  Have it your way.
&gt;&gt; Am not a Marxist or a Communist, no.  Nor is pure socialism the answer...nor
&gt;&gt; is pure capitalism the answer.  All of these systems concentrate power into
&gt;&gt; the hands of a few corrupt men.  We've seen a system that is superior to
&gt;&gt; ours: the Social Democracies of Scandinavia are the best example.  Our
&gt;&gt; system does not work for most Working Americans--the good news is that only
&gt;&gt; minor tweaks are needed to achieve the Scandinavian Social Democratic ideal
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's you who do more in a practical sense to buttress the Marxists
&gt;&gt; and the Communists...your so-called 'private enterprise' Corporatists prop
&gt;&gt; up Red China via your investment and purchasing habits...the Corporatists
&gt;&gt; actively help the Reds keep the low-paid and overworked Chinese Worker in
&gt;&gt; Communist chains.  Any talk about paying the Chinese Worker a proper wage is
&gt;&gt; quickly silenced--both in America and in Red China.  Which goes to prove
&gt;&gt; that while Communism amounts to public tyranny, Capitalism, as we know it,
&gt;&gt; is just privatized tyranny.

&gt;&gt; Pure Capitalism is as tyrannical and murderous as Stalinism or Fascism.
&gt;&gt; American Capitalists massacred 600,000 Filipinos during the McKinley
&gt;&gt; era...American Capitalists murdered millions of African slaves...American
&gt;&gt; Capitalists practised genocide against Native-Americans...American
&gt;&gt; Capitalists have destroyed the health of small children in
&gt;&gt; sweatshops...American Capitalists have murdered thousands of peaceful labor
&gt;&gt; protesters...and now American Capitalists use Red China as their Anti-Union
&gt;&gt; goon squad to enslave the Chinese Peasant Worker...and on and on.

&gt; At least those kids on Kid Nation are better off then the Chinese kids
&gt; who were kidnapped and sold into slavery ($65 each was the going rate)
&gt; to work in brickyards in Shanxi province.  Most of those bricks were
&gt; probably heading toward Beijing for Summer Olympic construction
&gt; projects.

&gt; There was one vile story, someone robbed a kid's train ticket, a woman
&gt; came up and said she would help him, and she sold him to a brickyard
&gt; owner.  Kidnapping these kids was probably a team effort: a spotter
&gt; checking for cognitively disabled  travellers or children alone, a
&gt; thief to grab the person's money and tickets and a helpful citizen to
&gt; lure the person into the fenced and guarded brickyard prison.   The
&gt; People's Public Security Bureau, which monitors Internet traffic so
&gt; tightly that if you send an e-mail from a Chinese cyber cafe in
&gt; Shanghai that includes the word Falun Gung, police will be in that
&gt; cafe in minutes, never did find any of the hundreds of missing kids
&gt; for months, even after mass protests by the parents of the missing
&gt; children.  These enslaved kids were in plain sight to government
&gt; inspectors, either paid off or ordered not to interfere with the Party
&gt; bosses brickyards.  A real workers' paradise over there.
">

There's a reason why the &quot;workers' paradises&quot; collapsed
- either a total political collapse, like the Soviet
Union, or a complete ideological collapse like Mao's
China.  That reason is evident to anyone except a
blinkered, brainwashed true-believer like &quot;classwarz&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism is predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on private enterprise and private property.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the private property the Capitalists now own was once public
&gt;&gt;&gt; property--it was stolen from the public via crony connections and sheer
&gt;&gt;&gt; corruption...that's how the railroads got their land.  It's easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt; leverage
&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself into capital when you've got friends in high places...that's
&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; enterprise, it's corruption.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism, as practised in the U.S., is not true capitalism anyhow...it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; a system of favoritism and corruption...them that has, gits.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare Mess (&gt;$200 billion a year in handouts to the very rich) is
&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known to all but you. There's very little true
&gt;&gt;&gt; competition--monopolies
&gt;&gt;&gt; and near monopolies are common...that's why gas is at an all-time high.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt; same group of well-heeled cronies flock from one corporate board to
&gt;&gt;&gt; another...that's not true competition, now is it?  American Capitalists
&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid of full-blown laissez-faire capitalism--they'd never survive it,
&gt;&gt;&gt; because the Workers would have few barriers toward becoming
&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrepreneurs
&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves...it's always the most conservative types in a town who fight
&gt;&gt;&gt; most vociferously for zoning regulations, for example--if your
&gt;&gt;&gt; unemployed
&gt;&gt;&gt; next-door neighbor opened a hot dog stand at his house, I'll bet you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; the first to scream 'zoning violation' at him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Private enterprise is a good thing, but those who are successful ought
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; pay those workers who made them successful a proper wage, adhere to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt;&gt; like anyone else, and these successful entreprenuers oughtn't to use
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt; cash to buy favorable policy decisions from the public's elected
&gt;&gt;&gt; officials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the confidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trickster's way of brainwashing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You demonstrate that you don't know what the fuck you're talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about, regarding anything, and that YOU are the one brainwashed by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of leftover 60s potheads.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not quite right...I do quite well financially as a programmer...and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt; my  corporate-made can of Pepsi just as anyone else does.  All I want is
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations to stop exerting undue influence over our government, pay
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt; fair share of taxes, and, to earn the privilege of access to our
&gt;&gt;&gt; Esteemed
&gt;&gt;&gt; American Work Force, pay American Workers proper wages and benefits.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That
&gt;&gt;&gt; leaves a heap of profits for the true entrepreneur...true
&gt;&gt;&gt; entrepreneurship
&gt;&gt;&gt; amongst our current crop of business leaders is dead because they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; getting a free ride to riches.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxism is dead.  Get over it.  It and all other forms of socialist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dogma were not based in reality, and have been discarded.  You want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spout that shit, feel free to do so - but understand that you are self-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marginalized by doing so.  You're powerless, you work to ensure that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you remain that way, and productive people everywhere laugh at you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scorn you.  Have it your way.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Am not a Marxist or a Communist, no.  Nor is pure socialism the
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer...nor
&gt;&gt;&gt; is pure capitalism the answer.  All of these systems concentrate power
&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt; the hands of a few corrupt men.  We've seen a system that is superior to
&gt;&gt;&gt; ours: the Social Democracies of Scandinavia are the best example.  Our
&gt;&gt;&gt; system does not work for most Working Americans--the good news is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt; minor tweaks are needed to achieve the Scandinavian Social Democratic
&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal
&gt;&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's you who do more in a practical sense to buttress the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxists
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Communists...your so-called 'private enterprise' Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt; prop
&gt;&gt;&gt; up Red China via your investment and purchasing habits...the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt; actively help the Reds keep the low-paid and overworked Chinese Worker
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Communist chains.  Any talk about paying the Chinese Worker a proper
&gt;&gt;&gt; wage is
&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly silenced--both in America and in Red China.  Which goes to prove
&gt;&gt;&gt; that while Communism amounts to public tyranny, Capitalism, as we know
&gt;&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is just privatized tyranny.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pure Capitalism is as tyrannical and murderous as Stalinism or Fascism.
&gt;&gt;&gt; American Capitalists massacred 600,000 Filipinos during the McKinley
&gt;&gt;&gt; era...American Capitalists murdered millions of African
&gt;&gt;&gt; slaves...American
&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists practised genocide against Native-Americans...American
&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists have destroyed the health of small children in
&gt;&gt;&gt; sweatshops...American Capitalists have murdered thousands of peaceful
&gt;&gt;&gt; labor
&gt;&gt;&gt; protesters...and now American Capitalists use Red China as their
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anti-Union

&gt;&gt; At least those kids on Kid Nation are better off then the Chinese kids
&gt;&gt; who were kidnapped and sold into slavery ($65 each was the going rate)
&gt;&gt; to work in brickyards in Shanxi province.  Most of those bricks were
&gt;&gt; probably heading toward Beijing for Summer Olympic construction
&gt;&gt; projects.

&gt;&gt; There was one vile story, someone robbed a kid's train ticket, a woman
&gt;&gt; came up and said she would help him, and she sold him to a brickyard
&gt;&gt; owner.  Kidnapping these kids was probably a team effort: a spotter
&gt;&gt; checking for cognitively disabled  travellers or children alone, a
&gt;&gt; thief to grab the person's money and tickets and a helpful citizen to
&gt;&gt; lure the person into the fenced and guarded brickyard prison.   The
&gt;&gt; People's Public Security Bureau, which monitors Internet traffic so
&gt;&gt; tightly that if you send an e-mail from a Chinese cyber cafe in
&gt;&gt; Shanghai that includes the word Falun Gung, police will be in that
&gt;&gt; cafe in minutes, never did find any of the hundreds of missing kids
&gt;&gt; for months, even after mass protests by the parents of the missing
&gt;&gt; children.  These enslaved kids were in plain sight to government
&gt;&gt; inspectors, either paid off or ordered not to interfere with the Party
&gt;&gt; bosses brickyards.  A real workers' paradise over there.

&gt; There's a reason why the &quot;workers' paradises&quot; collapsed - either a total
&gt; political collapse, like the Soviet Union, or a complete ideological
&gt; collapse like Mao's China.  That reason is evident to anyone except a
&gt; blinkered, brainwashed true-believer like &quot;classwarz&quot;.
">

You deliberately distorted my views, which I made known to you--you know
full well that a Progressive and a Social Democrat is as far removed from
Stalinism or Maoism as Pluto is from Mars.  That's okay...distortions from
you are expected by all.

Perhaps you're just embarrassed when you see your Corporatist heroes at
Wal-Mart cozy up to Red Chinese leaders?

I understand.

It does look as though that your beloved Authoritarian Corporatists are
aping the Authoritarian Communists these days.  Does that make you
uncomfortable at all?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Liar.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're an Apologist for Parasites who feed off the Producing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Working
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Class.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ha ha ha ha ha!  Boy, you're in full-on frenzied leftwing cliche
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spouting mode now, aren't you?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nothing cliche about it...workers produce, lazy capitalist investors
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; off production by the workers...that's parasitism.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, it's nothing but stale, worn-out and WRONG mushy marxist
&gt;&gt; &gt; bullshit.  Capitalism is not &quot;parasitism&quot;, workers can't produce
&gt;&gt; &gt; without capital, and capital won't be accumulated by workers.

&gt;&gt; False...worker-owned corporations are common and they thrive.

&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be capital.
&gt;&gt; And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce and not have
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.

&gt;&gt; I know that the left-wing Social Democracies of Europe provide a better
&gt;&gt; way
&gt;&gt; of life for the Producer-Worker--how's that?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports

&gt;&gt; &gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.

&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens
&gt;&gt; better
&gt;&gt; overall.  Most Americans are not doing well...only a few at the top do
&gt;&gt; well
&gt;&gt; materially.  Our system is very poor at creating wealth for most
&gt;&gt; citizens,

Spot on...and our Global Corporations and Investors are supporting that

Capitalism mates with Communism to produce one sickly brew.

CARE stats say that there are 126 million child laborers exploited in that
ball of dung called the Global World Economy.  It seems that the Capitalist
impulse to exploit children is alive and well.  You can't tell the
Capitalists and the Communists apart anymore...same shit, different pile, as
it were.  Both systems want labor, neither want to pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're an Apologist for Parasites who feed off the Producing Working
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Class.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ha ha ha ha ha!  Boy, you're in full-on frenzied leftwing cliche
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spouting mode now, aren't you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing cliche about it...workers produce, lazy capitalist investors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off production by the workers...that's parasitism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, it's nothing but stale, worn-out and WRONG mushy marxist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bullshit.  Capitalism is not &quot;parasitism&quot;, workers can't produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without capital, and capital won't be accumulated by workers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; False...worker-owned corporations are common and they thrive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capital.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that the left-wing Social Democracies of Europe provide a better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of life for the Producer-Worker--how's that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overall.  Most Americans are not doing well...only a few at the top do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; materially.  Our system is very poor at creating wealth for most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether you slander them as lazy or not...American workers are not lazy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're just poorly paid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism is predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on private enterprise and private property.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the private property the Capitalists now own was once public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; property--it was stolen from the public via crony connections and sheer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corruption...that's how the railroads got their land.  It's easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leverage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself into capital when you've got friends in high places...that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enterprise, it's corruption.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism, as practised in the U.S., is not true capitalism anyhow...it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a system of favoritism and corruption...them that has, gits.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare Mess (&gt;$200 billion a year in handouts to the very rich) is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known to all but you. There's very little true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competition--monopolies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and near monopolies are common...that's why gas is at an all-time high.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same group of well-heeled cronies flock from one corporate board to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another...that's not true competition, now is it?  American Capitalists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid of full-blown laissez-faire capitalism--they'd never survive it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the Workers would have few barriers toward becoming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrepreneurs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves...it's always the most conservative types in a town who fight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most vociferously for zoning regulations, for example--if your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unemployed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next-door neighbor opened a hot dog stand at his house, I'll bet you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first to scream 'zoning violation' at him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Private enterprise is a good thing, but those who are successful ought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay those workers who made them successful a proper wage, adhere to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like anyone else, and these successful entreprenuers oughtn't to use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cash to buy favorable policy decisions from the public's elected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the confidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trickster's way of brainwashing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You demonstrate that you don't know what the fuck you're talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about, regarding anything, and that YOU are the one brainwashed by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of leftover 60s potheads.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not quite right...I do quite well financially as a programmer...and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my  corporate-made can of Pepsi just as anyone else does.  All I want is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations to stop exerting undue influence over our government, pay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fair share of taxes, and, to earn the privilege of access to our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Esteemed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American Work Force, pay American Workers proper wages and benefits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leaves a heap of profits for the true entrepreneur...true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entrepreneurship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amongst our current crop of business leaders is dead because they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting a free ride to riches.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxism is dead.  Get over it.  It and all other forms of socialist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dogma were not based in reality, and have been discarded.  You want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spout that shit, feel free to do so - but understand that you are self-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marginalized by doing so.  You're powerless, you work to ensure that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you remain that way, and productive people everywhere laugh at you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scorn you.  Have it your way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Am not a Marxist or a Communist, no.  Nor is pure socialism the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer...nor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is pure capitalism the answer.  All of these systems concentrate power
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the hands of a few corrupt men.  We've seen a system that is superior to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ours: the Social Democracies of Scandinavia are the best example.  Our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system does not work for most Working Americans--the good news is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minor tweaks are needed to achieve the Scandinavian Social Democratic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's you who do more in a practical sense to buttress the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Communists...your so-called 'private enterprise' Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up Red China via your investment and purchasing habits...the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actively help the Reds keep the low-paid and overworked Chinese Worker
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Communist chains.  Any talk about paying the Chinese Worker a proper
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wage is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly silenced--both in America and in Red China.  Which goes to prove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that while Communism amounts to public tyranny, Capitalism, as we know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is just privatized tyranny.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pure Capitalism is as tyrannical and murderous as Stalinism or Fascism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American Capitalists massacred 600,000 Filipinos during the McKinley
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; era...American Capitalists murdered millions of African
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slaves...American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists practised genocide against Native-Americans...American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists have destroyed the health of small children in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sweatshops...American Capitalists have murdered thousands of peaceful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; labor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protesters...and now American Capitalists use Red China as their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anti-Union
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goon squad to enslave the Chinese Peasant Worker...and on and on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At least those kids on Kid Nation are better off then the Chinese kids
&gt;&gt;&gt; who were kidnapped and sold into slavery ($65 each was the going rate)
&gt;&gt;&gt; to work in brickyards in Shanxi province.  Most of those bricks were
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably heading toward Beijing for Summer Olympic construction
&gt;&gt;&gt; projects.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There was one vile story, someone robbed a kid's train ticket, a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt; came up and said she would help him, and she sold him to a brickyard
&gt;&gt;&gt; owner.  Kidnapping these kids was probably a team effort: a spotter
&gt;&gt;&gt; checking for cognitively disabled  travellers or children alone, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; thief to grab the person's money and tickets and a helpful citizen to
&gt;&gt;&gt; lure the person into the fenced and guarded brickyard prison.   The
&gt;&gt;&gt; People's Public Security Bureau, which monitors Internet traffic so
&gt;&gt;&gt; tightly that if you send an e-mail from a Chinese cyber cafe in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shanghai that includes the word Falun Gung, police will be in that
&gt;&gt;&gt; cafe in minutes, never did find any of the hundreds of missing kids
&gt;&gt;&gt; for months, even after mass protests by the parents of the missing
&gt;&gt;&gt; children.  These enslaved kids were in plain sight to government
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspectors, either paid off or ordered not to interfere with the Party
&gt;&gt;&gt; bosses brickyards.  A real workers' paradise over there.
&gt;&gt; There's a reason why the &quot;workers' paradises&quot; collapsed - either a total
&gt;&gt; political collapse, like the Soviet Union, or a complete ideological
&gt;&gt; collapse like Mao's China.  That reason is evident to anyone except a

Hmmm. Let's compare Rudy with a one of those &quot;mushy marxists&quot;...

&quot;It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be
made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its
connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief
attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with,
if not above, labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that
labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors,
unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by use of it, induces
him to labor.

&quot;Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the
fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
existed. Labor is the superior of capital and man deserves much the
higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of
protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and
probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital,
producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole
labor of the community exists within that relation. A few men own
capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital
hire or buy another few to labor for them.

&quot;No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up
from poverty, none, less inclined to take or touch aught which they
have nor honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political
power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will
surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they,
and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty
be lost.&quot; - President Abraham Lincoln, address to Congress, December 3,
1861

&quot;These capitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert, to fleece
the people.&quot;  -  Abraham Lincoln

Rudy, you are the funniest shit-for-brains on Usenet. Abraham Lincoln
had more authority in his little pinky than you will exercise in your
entire life, Rudy.

Keep up the humor, though. You are better than any sit-com on tee vee.

Hey, here's more quotes you can dismiss because he doesn't qualify, in
your book, as an economist.

But still, the question is whether the words are true or not, not
whether Rudy Canoza approves of the speaker's qualifications.

Or don't you agree, Rudy?

&quot;At times like the present, when the evils of unsound finance threaten
us, the speculator may anticipate a harvest gathered from the
misfortune of others, the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding or
may even find profit in the fluctuations of values; but the wage
earner---the first to be injured by a depreciated currency and the last
receive the benefit of its correction---is practically
defenseless...&quot; - Grover Cleveland

&quot;As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the
existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while the citizen is
struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron
heel.  Corporations which should be restrained creatures of the law and
servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters.&quot;  -

rich and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor.&quot;  -  Grover

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Liar.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Working
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Class.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bullshit.  Capitalism is not &quot;parasitism&quot;, workers can't produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without capital, and capital won't be accumulated by workers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; False...worker-owned corporations are common and they thrive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capital.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that the left-wing Social Democracies of Europe provide a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of life for the Producer-Worker--how's that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overall.  Most Americans are not doing well...only a few at the top do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; materially.  Our system is very poor at creating wealth for most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether you slander them as lazy or not...American workers are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lazy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're just poorly paid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism is predicated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on private enterprise and private property.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the private property the Capitalists now own was once public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; property--it was stolen from the public via crony connections and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sheer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corruption...that's how the railroads got their land.  It's easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leverage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself into capital when you've got friends in high places...that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enterprise, it's corruption.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism, as practised in the U.S., is not true capitalism
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyhow...it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a system of favoritism and corruption...them that has, gits.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare Mess (&gt;$200 billion a year in handouts to the very rich) is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known to all but you. There's very little true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competition--monopolies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and near monopolies are common...that's why gas is at an all-time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same group of well-heeled cronies flock from one corporate board to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another...that's not true competition, now is it?  American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid of full-blown laissez-faire capitalism--they'd never survive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the Workers would have few barriers toward becoming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrepreneurs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves...it's always the most conservative types in a town who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most vociferously for zoning regulations, for example--if your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unemployed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next-door neighbor opened a hot dog stand at his house, I'll bet you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first to scream 'zoning violation' at him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Private enterprise is a good thing, but those who are successful ought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay those workers who made them successful a proper wage, adhere to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like anyone else, and these successful entreprenuers oughtn't to use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cash to buy favorable policy decisions from the public's elected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trickster's way of brainwashing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You demonstrate that you don't know what the fuck you're talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about, regarding anything, and that YOU are the one brainwashed by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of leftover 60s potheads.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not quite right...I do quite well financially as a programmer...and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my  corporate-made can of Pepsi just as anyone else does.  All I want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corporations to stop exerting undue influence over our government, pay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fair share of taxes, and, to earn the privilege of access to our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Esteemed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American Work Force, pay American Workers proper wages and benefits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leaves a heap of profits for the true entrepreneur...true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entrepreneurship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amongst our current crop of business leaders is dead because they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting a free ride to riches.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxism is dead.  Get over it.  It and all other forms of socialist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dogma were not based in reality, and have been discarded.  You want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spout that shit, feel free to do so - but understand that you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; self-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marginalized by doing so.  You're powerless, you work to ensure that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you remain that way, and productive people everywhere laugh at you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scorn you.  Have it your way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Am not a Marxist or a Communist, no.  Nor is pure socialism the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer...nor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is pure capitalism the answer.  All of these systems concentrate power
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the hands of a few corrupt men.  We've seen a system that is superior
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ours: the Social Democracies of Scandinavia are the best example.  Our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system does not work for most Working Americans--the good news is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minor tweaks are needed to achieve the Scandinavian Social Democratic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's you who do more in a practical sense to buttress the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marxists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Communists...your so-called 'private enterprise' Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up Red China via your investment and purchasing habits...the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corporatists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actively help the Reds keep the low-paid and overworked Chinese Worker
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Communist chains.  Any talk about paying the Chinese Worker a proper
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wage is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly silenced--both in America and in Red China.  Which goes to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that while Communism amounts to public tyranny, Capitalism, as we know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is just privatized tyranny.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pure Capitalism is as tyrannical and murderous as Stalinism or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fascism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American Capitalists massacred 600,000 Filipinos during the McKinley
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; era...American Capitalists murdered millions of African
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slaves...American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists practised genocide against Native-Americans...American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalists have destroyed the health of small children in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sweatshops...American Capitalists have murdered thousands of peaceful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; labor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protesters...and now American Capitalists use Red China as their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anti-Union
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goon squad to enslave the Chinese Peasant Worker...and on and on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least those kids on Kid Nation are better off then the Chinese kids
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who were kidnapped and sold into slavery ($65 each was the going rate)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to work in brickyards in Shanxi province.  Most of those bricks were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably heading toward Beijing for Summer Olympic construction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; projects.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was one vile story, someone robbed a kid's train ticket, a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; came up and said she would help him, and she sold him to a brickyard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; owner.  Kidnapping these kids was probably a team effort: a spotter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; checking for cognitively disabled  travellers or children alone, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thief to grab the person's money and tickets and a helpful citizen to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lure the person into the fenced and guarded brickyard prison.   The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People's Public Security Bureau, which monitors Internet traffic so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tightly that if you send an e-mail from a Chinese cyber cafe in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shanghai that includes the word Falun Gung, police will be in that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cafe in minutes, never did find any of the hundreds of missing kids
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for months, even after mass protests by the parents of the missing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; children.  These enslaved kids were in plain sight to government
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inspectors, either paid off or ordered not to interfere with the Party
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bosses brickyards.  A real workers' paradise over there.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a reason why the &quot;workers' paradises&quot; collapsed - either a total
&gt;&gt;&gt; political collapse, like the Soviet Union, or a complete ideological
&gt;&gt;&gt; collapse like Mao's China.  That reason is evident to anyone except a

You are ignorant.  Check it out, shitbag - incomes of
OECD countries at purchasing power parity:
http://www.demographia.com/db-ppp60+.htm .

The U.S. has higher GDP per capita than everyone.
Without exception.

That chart shows a number of other interesting things,
all bad for the dull plodding socialist:  you.  First,
West Germany, which was always in second or third
position after the U.S., fell precipitously after they
had to incorporate the utterly failed &quot;socialist
paradise&quot; of East Germany.  The combined Germany now is
in 12th place among these countries.  Secondly, Norway,
a vastly more free-market country than Sweden, beats
the hell out of the socialist Swedes in the per-capita
GDP statistics.

The upshot is, the charts show that the more
free-market/private enterprise countries do better than
the more socialist countries.

&gt; to incorporate the utterly failed &quot;socialist paradise&quot; of East Germany.

wealth to anyone making the claim (you, nitwit) that he's a UCLA PhD econ

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investors feed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off production by the workers...that's parasitism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, it's nothing but stale, worn-out and WRONG mushy marxist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bullshit.  Capitalism is not &quot;parasitism&quot;, workers can't produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without capital, and capital won't be accumulated by workers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; False...worker-owned corporations are common and they thrive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capital. And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and not have it leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better overall.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  Those people all are measurably poorer in terms of purchasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; power parity, with the exception of a couple of inconsequential places
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like Liechtenstein.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's false.  Go travel there sometime.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've done more than travel there, shit-4-braincell: I've *lived* there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice.

You don't know squatty-doo about them.  You don't even

damaged by the German occupation during WWII, caught

Sweden's, while in 1960 Sweden's was almost 25% higher

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ha ha ha ha ha!  Boy, you're in full-on frenzied leftwing cliche
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spouting mode now, aren't you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing cliche about it...workers produce, lazy capitalist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investors feed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off production by the workers...that's parasitism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, it's nothing but stale, worn-out and WRONG mushy marxist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bullshit.  Capitalism is not &quot;parasitism&quot;, workers can't produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without capital, and capital won't be accumulated by workers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; False...worker-owned corporations are common and they thrive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Workers produce capital...without workers there wouldn't even be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capital. And, the workers should get to keep the capital they produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and not have it leveraged away from them by the powerful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know nothing of economics - zero.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that the left-wing Social Democracies of Europe provide a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better way of life for the Producer-Worker--how's that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's face it, you want a system that supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want a system that creates wealth and satisfies consumer demand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better overall.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.  Those people all are measurably poorer in terms of purchasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; power parity, with the exception of a couple of inconsequential places
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like Liechtenstein.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's false.  Go travel there sometime.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've done more than travel there, shit-4-braincell: I've *lived* there
&gt;&gt;&gt; twice.

&gt;&gt; Liar.

&gt; Nope.  Lived in Switzerland for a year, 1971-72, and in Germany for 18

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism does that, better than any other.
&gt; &gt;&gt; No, the hybridized Social Democracies of Europe serve their citizens better
&gt; &gt;&gt; overall.  Most Americans are not doing well...only a few at the top do well
&gt; &gt;&gt; materially.  Our system is very poor at creating wealth for most citizens,
&gt; &gt;&gt; whether you slander them as lazy or not...American workers are not lazy,
&gt; &gt;&gt; they're just poorly paid.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalism is predicated
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on private enterprise and private property.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Most of the private property the Capitalists now own was once public
&gt; &gt;&gt; property--it was stolen from the public via crony connections and sheer
&gt; &gt;&gt; corruption...that's how the railroads got their land.  It's easy to leverage
&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself into capital when you've got friends in high places...that's not
&gt; &gt;&gt; enterprise, it's corruption.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Capitalism, as practised in the U.S., is not true capitalism anyhow...it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; a system of favoritism and corruption...them that has, gits.  The Corporate
&gt; &gt;&gt; Welfare Mess (&gt;$200 billion a year in handouts to the very rich) is
&gt; &gt;&gt; well-known to all but you. There's very little true competition--monopolies
&gt; &gt;&gt; and near monopolies are common...that's why gas is at an all-time high.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; same group of well-heeled cronies flock from one corporate board to
&gt; &gt;&gt; another...that's not true competition, now is it?  American Capitalists are
&gt; &gt;&gt; afraid of full-blown laissez-faire capitalism--they'd never survive it,
&gt; &gt;&gt; because the Workers would have few barriers toward becoming Entrepreneurs
&gt; &gt;&gt; themselves...it's always the most conservative types in a town who fight
&gt; &gt;&gt; most vociferously for zoning regulations, for example--if your unemployed
&gt; &gt;&gt; next-door neighbor opened a hot dog stand at his house, I'll bet you'd be
&gt; &gt;&gt; the first to scream 'zoning violation' at him.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Private enterprise is a good thing, but those who are successful ought to
&gt; &gt;&gt; pay those workers who made them successful a proper wage, adhere to the law
&gt; &gt;&gt; like anyone else, and these successful entreprenuers oughtn't to use their
&gt; &gt;&gt; cash to buy favorable policy decisions from the public's elected officials.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Economics, as taught in American universities, is just the confidence
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trickster's way of brainwashing the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You demonstrate that you don't know what the fuck you're talking
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; about, regarding anything, and that YOU are the one brainwashed by a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of leftover 60s potheads.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Not quite right...I do quite well financially as a programmer...and I like
&gt; &gt;&gt; my  corporate-made can of Pepsi just as anyone else does.  All I want is for
&gt; &gt;&gt; corporations to stop exerting undue influence over our government, pay their
&gt; &gt;&gt; fair share of taxes, and, to earn the privilege of access to our Esteemed
&gt; &gt;&gt; American Work Force, pay American Workers proper wages and benefits.  That
&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves a heap of profits for the true entrepreneur...true entrepreneurship
&gt; &gt;&gt; amongst our current crop of business leaders is dead because they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; getting a free ride to riches.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Marxism is dead.  Get over it.  It and all other forms of socialist
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dogma were not based in reality, and have been discarded.  You want to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; spout that shit, feel free to do so - but understand that you are self-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; marginalized by doing so.  You're powerless, you work to ensure that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you remain that way, and productive people everywhere laugh at you and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; scorn you.  Have it your way.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Am not a Marxist or a Communist, no.  Nor is pure socialism the answer...nor
&gt; &gt;&gt; is pure capitalism the answer.  All of these systems concentrate power into
&gt; &gt;&gt; the hands of a few corrupt men.  We've seen a system that is superior to
&gt; &gt;&gt; ours: the Social Democracies of Scandinavia are the best example.  Our
&gt; &gt;&gt; system does not work for most Working Americans--the good news is that only
&gt; &gt;&gt; minor tweaks are needed to achieve the Scandinavian Social Democratic ideal
&gt; &gt;&gt; here.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyhow, it's you who do more in a practical sense to buttress the Marxists
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the Communists...your so-called 'private enterprise' Corporatists prop
&gt; &gt;&gt; up Red China via your investment and purchasing habits...the Corporatists
&gt; &gt;&gt; actively help the Reds keep the low-paid and overworked Chinese Worker in
&gt; &gt;&gt; Communist chains.  Any talk about paying the Chinese Worker a proper wage is
&gt; &gt;&gt; quickly silenced--both in America and in Red China.  Which goes to prove
&gt; &gt;&gt; that while Communism amounts to public tyranny, Capitalism, as we know it,
&gt; &gt;&gt; is just privatized tyranny.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Pure Capitalism is as tyrannical and murderous as Stalinism or Fascism.
&gt; &gt;&gt; American Capitalists massacred 600,000 Filipinos during the McKinley
&gt; &gt;&gt; era...American Capitalists murdered millions of African slaves...American
&gt; &gt;&gt; Capitalists practised genocide against Native-Americans...American
&gt; &gt;&gt; Capitalists have destroyed the health of small children in
&gt; &gt;&gt; sweatshops...American Capitalists have murdered thousands of peaceful labor
&gt; &gt;&gt; protesters...and now American Capitalists use Red China as their Anti-Union
&gt; &gt;&gt; goon squad to enslave the Chinese Peasant Worker...and on and on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look, punky:  you're overmatched.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Self-delusion.
&gt;&gt; No, not in the least.  You *are* overmatched, punky - and badly so.

&gt; I've got you on the defensive again

You already posted this bullshit, and I already
responded to it, showing again that you're a marginal
far out on the lunatic fringe.  Stop trying to waste my
time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rudy, you are the funniest shit-for-brains on Usenet.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dizzy, Lincoln never studied economics or political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Golly, never? He was completely ignorant of economics?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.  Lincoln never even attended law school, although
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he &quot;read&quot; law and passed the bar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes you think he did study economics, dizzy?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where, when and with whom?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Poor Rudy.
&gt;&gt; Ha ha ha ha ha!  Lincoln the great anti-capitalist:

&gt;&gt; dizzy, you never cease to amuse us with your singular
&gt;&gt; talent for shooting yourself in your doughy ass.

&gt; Rudy, you are the one calling him a &quot;mushy marxist.&quot;
">

No, I didn't, dizzy.  You're a liar.  I used the term
once, and it wasn't in reference to Lincoln.

Didn't the village teach you lying is wrong, dizzy?

You fucked up, dizzy.  You wanted to claim Lincoln as
one of The Side, and you shot yourself in your doughy
ass.  Just admit you fucked up, dizzy, and move on.
