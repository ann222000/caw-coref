I hope you're joking.  Using your biceps during the deadlift is a good
way to get them torn off the bone.

Kinda. Not using them is a good way to dislocate a shoulder. The muscles
contract even when your arms are straight because the cross the shoulder
joint (well, one head does). I was also half alluding to my belief that
if you're wasting your time trying to 'pump' your biceps you're not
going to gain enough mass for anyone to notice, even on your biceps.

I've seen 800 pound deadlifts and have never ever seen anyone
dislocate a shoulder while deadlifting.  In fact, most good
deadlifters will stretch their shoulders to make their arms as long as
possible while deadlifting.  OTOH, I've seen people deadlift with a
slightly bent arm that have ripped the biceps right off the bone.

enough bickering children..

i always struggled with my bi's...
i know this is booooring.. but im afraid its true.. standing straight bar
curls.. heavy, good form, full rom, cheat for last 2 reps, sometimes spotter
for forced.

honestly. and standing, cross-body dumbell hammer curls have given me some
nice shape when viewed from the front. thats all i do at mo..

The elbow does not have to be bent for the biceps to work hard to help
you pull and stabilise the weight, but that's not really the point I was
trying to make re: productive lifting in contrast to 'pump' lifting.

Standing overhead cable curls give me a good pump. High rep dumbbell curls
seem to pump well too. I think some of the best pumps I've had are with 15
reps on the 55lb dumbbell's.

One-armed standing barbell curls (and it's best, because it targes
way more than just a bicep).  Sternum pullups are a close second.

I no longer do them, as they require a gym. My workouts now are at home.

I would do them once a week as the only direct biceps exercise. Plenty of

Actually, for pump sake, you might wanna try a machine with constant
resistance, IOW, there is just as much load in the beginning, middle and
last part of the rep.

Usually, biceps dont get much stress at the end, if any.

You might give it a try.

Correct.

Whilst standing, perform a curl, with a barbell.

Because it gives the best pump? Or maybe because it works best for him? Or

Gee, how could i forget ?!?!?!

Big, useless, fluffy muscles, due to "muscle-buildup."

Avoid this at all times. Do one rep, and drop the weight. And use lower
back/hip momentum to get the weight up.

Avoid heavy contractions of the biceps at all times.

You may wanna check PubMed, but every pop fitness website I've
consulted (and, ohhhh, there are MANY) states that peak is determined
by genetics and not altered by machine nor bar nor sand buckets nor
any manner of resistance.

Losing bodyfat will allow the biceps peak you already possess to be
revealed, however it doesn't physically create that peak.

So sayeth Flex magazine. Do not doubt The Text of Flex! ;o)

but the feeling, the struggle at the top end of the rep is so hard... its
gotta help a little. like when you squeeze your bicep and can feel the deep
pinch inside its belly... its within that range of the movement...
basically, its a good feeling.. i'll let you know if i create a little peak!

I dont think so.

But i suspect that you will be able to flex them better.

Which is why BBers still value those exercises. It wont give you any more

And another thing about the peak;

The peak will come, with the right genetics, if the biceps are developed to
the max. Or are close to. Just like that teardrop in the lower/outher side
of the pectorals. There are no exercises for it. It will come if you build
enough size.

You grab the barbell in the middle by one arm at a time and curl it
up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Barbells are long, so in order to keep them level you need to use
your forearms quite a bit too.  There would be some marginal stress
to your torso muscles, due to asymmetric load too, but not much if
you do strict curls.  Not enough weight for that, but you'll find
that you really try to be tight while doing this movement.

Concentration curls focus on the brachialis, not the biceps peak. If you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Losing bodyfat will allow the biceps peak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you already possess to be revealed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however it doesn't physically create that peak.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So sayeth Flex magazine. Do not doubt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Text of Flex! ;o)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i realise that already.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the feeling, the struggle at the top end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the rep is so hard... its gotta help a little.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Otoh, my Magic Internet 8-Ball Pop Fitness Website Arnold Quote
&gt;&gt;&gt; Generator says:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone is born with a different set of genes, including those that
&gt;&gt;&gt; determine muscle size and shape. Some people naturally have the
&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to put on great amounts of muscle mass, while others have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; fight for every pound. Some have long full muscle bellies, while
&gt;&gt;&gt; others have muscles that are shorter or less round. The kind of
&gt;&gt;&gt; muscles you inherit is pretty much the luck of the draw, and since you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can't choose your parents, you'll have to make the best of what you've
&gt;&gt;&gt; got.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; OtOoh, even Ahnuld believed in concentration curls. Still, if they
&gt;&gt;&gt; worked, then why weren't his biceps peaked equally?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like when you squeeze your bicep and can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feel the deep pinch inside its belly... its within
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that range of the movement...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basically, its a good feeling.. i'll let you know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if i create a little peak!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; btw. not enough B/F to make a difference... ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bastard!

&gt; You grab the barbell in the middle by one arm at a time and curl it
&gt; up.

&gt;&gt; Why?

&gt; Barbells are long, so in order to keep them level you need to use your
&gt; forearms quite a bit too.  There would be some marginal stress to your

&gt; to be tight while doing this movement.

Hmm. If the bar's balanced in your hand, i don't see why it would be
different to a dumbbell curl. If it's not, i can see that it definitely
would be!

The body would be dynamically working to balance the bar. Unless of course
you found the ideal balance point and exerted ONLY force that runs parallel
to the opposing force (gravity). It works on paper but according to
numerical analysis it is an impossibility in practice.

This is a subject that I am very ignorant in. What part of ones body
controls balance. Lever machines require no balance but freeweights do.
How do analogous exercises compare between freeweights and lever machines?

&gt; Are you saying that curls for 12-15 reps are not productive?

Nope. I'm saying training for a pump is unlikely to be productive if
that is the goal each workout.

A lot of ways, including taking time away from large multi-joint
exercises that hit the biceps among several other muscles.

&gt;Gidday.
&gt;I love doing pump classes at the gym.  Best with an agressive
&gt;instructor who likes their music loud.  I realy feel the burn if the
&gt;biceps track is fast and long.  Does this help?
