Try Jerry Howe's training manual.

Please do not listen to the others in here that don't like
him or his methods, they have never tried them....I  have
and it works!!!!

I broke my dog from nipping almost 100% in 1 day and
she usually does this SEVERAL times a day and actually
makes my kids bleed!

Try it or contact him!  The manual is at the above website
also, and it is free!

Hi ! Our black lab girl is 3 months old
(she will be 4 months on the 30th).

When we first brought her home she had a
bad habit of trying to nip our faces (including
my 3 year old twins) during playtime.

It drove everyone in the house nuts and it
brought my little girls to tears as you can
imagine.

We tried saying no, and that would just get
her even more excited, so we would yell no
and that would just get her "scared" but still
excited.

In short it just wasn't working.

So we finally did what Jerry has suggested to you.

We used a sound do distract her and we would
immediately praise her.

I have to say that it worked great.

BUT she then moved on to nipping at the feet
LOL silly little thing.

So again, we tried no, and then louder no,
but again it didn't work so we went for the
distraction and praise.

I must say that she is doing great!

I hope that helps. Edyta aka Ned

Dogs Can Easily And Readily Be Done Using TLC.
Tender Loving Care Is At The Root Of The Scientific
Management Of Doggys.  &lt;{) ; ~ ) &gt;

"...all the highest nervous activity, as it manifests
itself in the conditional reflex, consists of a continual
change of these three fundamental processes --
excitation, inhibition and disinhibition,"  Ivan P. Pavlov

"Postitive emotions arising in connection
with the perfection of a skill, irrespective
of its pragmatic significance at a given
moment, serve as the reinforcement. IOW,
emotions, not outside rewards, are what
reinforces any behavior," Ivan Pavlov.

"All animals learn best through play." -- Konrad Lorenz

"Despite Skinner's clear denunciation of "negative
reinforcement" (1958) NEARLY EVER LEARNING
THEORY model involves the USE OF PUNISHMENT.
Of curse, Skinner has never to my knowledge, demonstrated
HOWE we escape the phenomenon that an expected
reward not received is experienced as a punishment
and can produce extensive and persistent aggression
(Azrin et al, 1966).

Kanner (1954) reports that 13 classically autistic
children improved enough to go to school without
"anything that is regarded as good psychotherapy or
as psychotherapy at all...

Autistic children have been known to become
permenantely social by deinstitutionalization,
BY REMOVAL  from the parents, BY RADICAL
CHANGES in other environments, and by MASSIVE
DOSAGE of TOUCHING, HOLDING, FONDLING
LOVE DESPITE THE REJECTION OF THE CHILD.

The IMBECILITY of some of the claims for operant
technique simply take the breath away. Lovas et al
(1966) report a standard contingent reward/punishment
procedure developing imitative speech in two severly
disturbed non verbal schizophrenic boys. After twenty-
six days the boys are reported to have been learning
new words with alacrity. HOWEver, when REWARDS were
moved to a delayed contingency the behavoir and learning
immediately deteriorated."

"It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's social
behaviors shaping the child (Whaler, 1966). Some
clinics have reported ELIMINATION ofthe need for
child THERAPY through changing the clinical emphasis
from clinical to parental HANDLING of the child
(Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently after
preliminary contact with parents that NO treatment
of children was required, and almost ALL cases
SHOWE a remarkably shortened period for therapy.
Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in own to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING
SUBSTITUTES (Groen, 1966)."

handsome happy jackass morrison aka dogman aka tommy sorenson sez:

"I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little "knee action," that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her "over-reacting."

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it."

"My objective is always to find a way that WORKS.
And if it is DANGEROUS behavior that I'm trying
to modify, behavior than can get the dog KILLED,
I will resort to ANYTHING to save him.

A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Okay.  Call me a cruel, inhumane, abusive bastard
if you want to, but it doesn't affect me at all.
When you've saved the lives of as many dogs as I
have, you'll learn that that's the only thing that
really matters.  Saving lives and making dogs become
good citizens

At no time do the Monks *ever* advocate beating a
dog. A swat on the rump or a check to the chin does
*not* constitute a "beating."

Subject: Re: good dog training books?

I've personally seen their methods (as applied by
them) NOT work on dogs they themselves have bred.

IMO, their methods actually made the underlying problems
*worse*. In three cases, where they both bred and trained
the dogs, they subsequently washed their hands of the dogs
and suggested euthanasia....and then promptly tried to
talk the owners into taking another one of their own pups.

&lt;snip&gt;

Since I have serious issues and doubts about the
practices and ethics of the Monks, I obviously
only support the latter two ;-)

Subject: Re: Monks of New Skete

Just as a bit of a counterpoint, my trainer has a Great
Pyrenees looking for a home right now that was *ruined*
by these books.  Not all methods are valid for all dogs
or all owners or all dog/owner combinations.

While these books may work for you and others and dogs
you have worked, I've found the practices within to be
significantly less reliable than other methods, even
when properly applied, especially the "shake", even if
the methods do work for many owners and dogs.

Personally, I've seen far too many disastrous results
to recommend these books to anyone (sight unseen).

IOW, one can't really recommend a book or method without
first evaluating the owner/dog combo and anyone reading
such recommendations should remember this and remember
to try other methods when the ones they are using fail.

Subject: Re: Recommendations on Puppy training Books

Personally, I do not care for the Monks book.
(Even Job Michael Evans, one of its two co-authors,
later rethought the "alpha roll" advice.)

My main objection is that it assumes the dog will
be raised in the same kind of milieu as the New
Skete monastery, which is very far from accurate.

Subject: My GSD bit me.
The question:

I have a four year old male GSD.  He growls at me sometimes.
When he growls at me he stares me in the face and lays his
ears back.

The New Skete books say that the dog should not be allowed
to do that.  They suggest shaking down the dog by grabing
the dog on the sides of his neck and picking him off his
front feet, then giving the dog the same sort of treatment
the dog would give another if it were challenging him.

Namely getting in the dogs face and letting
the dog know you are the alpha dog.

Well, my dog bit me clearly he felt that I was not
convincing enough or he bit me out of fear.

Anyone got ideas on what to do with this dog that might
help him to decide that he wants to follow and that he
has nothing to fear from me?
