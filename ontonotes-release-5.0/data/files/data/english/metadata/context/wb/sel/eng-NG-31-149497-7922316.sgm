I have a friend whose mother is so ugly that the chances of her getting
laid make your stats pale in comparison. :)Seriously, I like what
Richard Dawkins always says, - something like, &quot;It's true that it's
statistically unlikely, but it only has to happen once.&quot;

It's an argument i have often used when sparing with fundies. The odds
of any one of us having obtained life is so vast as to make the lottery
look like a coin toss. Th gratest people who could possibly ever live
didn't make the cut.....too bad you have to take me, instead......

Definitely random and accidental!During a human male ejaculation,
300,000,000 (300 million)spermatozoa are released! And only one
fertilizes an egg.To add to the accidental; According to Stanford
School of Medicine, &quot;Even after implantation, spontaneous abortions can
occur. In the normal course of human reproduction, about 60 percent of
embryos spontaneously abort and are simply flushed in the course of the
menstrual cycle&quot;. So much for the soul being given at fertilization!

Coming to grips with the fact that god did not &quot;form me in my mother's
womb&quot; was actually a major part of my deconversion process. I was
taught since birth that god had a hand in the creation of every person
alive today. The old scripture about god knowing every detail of my
life before I even existed comes to mind.But to accept that is to
accept that god can create something less than perfect. How can a
perfect being create an imperfect baby?Furthermore, WHY? Why would this
god go out of his way to fuck up not just my life but the lives of
countless other people since time began?And I'm supposed to WORSHIP
this being?HELL NO!!~ Aurelia ~

There is a youtube video out there where a guy illustrates the point by
dumping out a bunch of sugar and stating how astronomical the odds are
agaist each grain of sugar lying exactly where they did in relation to
the others, yet it happened and it was entirely by chance.xrayman

You know, I sometimes think about all the babies that die at birth, and
the children that only live very very short lives, and also the ones
that are born with mental/physical retardiness, and then think to
myself; if god exist, he/she/it should have the all-power to at least
mix the sperm with the egg right to create everyone equal. I think to
myself, this shit just ain't no fair, so what's the purpose in
life. &quot;Some&quot; religous people will say,&quot;god works in mysterious ways&quot;,
all the while thinking deeply about it themselves and doubting in their
god's existense.

Moronic.The comparison between your existence and the evolution of life
itself is a stunning false analogy.

Dave,I've considered your own thoughts several times in my life about
why the person I call 'ME' is the one that landed up alive, over and
above a non-ME person.Beyond what you said though, I've wondered such
things as to why I was lucky enough to land up in the USA and not
somewhere much less pleasant on earth. What are the chances of being
born not only in the USA versus other countries, but in a time of
having all this modern technology etc..Also, why wasn't I born as one
of MANY lower life forms we have around, as some religions believe we
can be.Are we to assume that because I'm such a ummm 'great being',
that god chose to put me in this great land and time, and as a human
life form as well?Then of course we have the folks who think god exists
because the chances are also mighty slim for having such a viable
planet as earth, with just the right conditions to support life.Surely
it took a 'god' to make such a perfect planet, they insist.Of course,
they ignore the fact that we couldn't have been born on Jupiter or Mars
etc., so where else could we have landed up being born....other than
some other distant earth; if one does exists.It makes much more sense
to say you were born on earth, because it's really the only place you
could have been born; that we know about.If you weren't 'born' on such
a viable planet, you wouldn't be pondering such questions like these,
at all.So there are two ways to look at all this chance going on.Either
one realizes that things do indeed happen by beating some huge odds, or
god is directing the whole show, right down to the swimming sperms you
mention.I think the answer is quite obvious, but only if one takes off
that darn fundie hat first.AtheistToothFairy

The point, Gold-troll, is that the statistical unlikelihood of things
is a moronic Christian apologetic. Anyway, you wore out your welcome
here a few years ago. Your comments are deleted.
