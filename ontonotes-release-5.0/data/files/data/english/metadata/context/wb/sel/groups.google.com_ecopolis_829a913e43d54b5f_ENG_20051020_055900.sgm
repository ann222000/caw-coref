Old Ways of Life Are Fading as the Arctic Thaws

TIKSI, Russia - Freed by warming, waters once locked beneath ice are
gnawing at coastal settlements around the Arctic Circle.

In Bykovsky, a village of 457 on Russia's northeast coast, the
shoreline is collapsing, creeping closer and closer to houses and tanks
of heating oil, at a rate of 15 to 18 feet a year. Eventually, homes
will be lost, and maybe all of Bykovsky, too, under ever-longer periods
of assault by open water. &quot;It is eating up the land,&quot; said Innokenty
Koryakin, a member of the Evenk tribe and the captain of a fishing
boat. &quot;You cannot do anything about it.&quot;

To the east, Fyodor V. Sellyakhov scours a barren island with 16 hired
men. Mammoths lived here tens of thousands of years ago, and their
carcasses eventually sank deep into sediment that is now offering up a
trove of tusks and bones nearly as valuable as elephant ivory.

Mr. Sellyakhov, a native Yakut, hauls the fossils to a warehouse here
and sells them for $25 to $50 a pound. This summer he collected two
tons, making him a wealthy man, for Tiksi. &quot;The sea washes down the
coast every year,&quot; he said. &quot;It is practically all ice - permafrost -
and it is thawing.&quot;

For the four million people who live north of the Arctic Circle, in
remote outposts and the improbable industrial centers built by Soviet
decree, a changing climate presents new opportunities. But it also
threatens their environment, their homes and, for those whose
traditions rely on the ice-bound wilderness, the preservation of their
culture.

A push to develop the North, quickened by the melting of the Arctic
seas, carries its own rewards and dangers for people in the region. The
discovery of vast petroleum fields in the Barents and Kara Seas has
raised fears of catastrophic accidents as ships loaded with oil and,
soon, liquefied gas churn through the fisheries off Scandinavia, headed
to markets in Europe and North America. Land that was untouched could
be tainted by pollution as generators, smokestacks and large vehicles
sprout to support the growing energy industry.

But the thaw itself is already causing widespread anxiety. In Russia,
20 percent of which lies above the Arctic Circle, melting of the
permafrost threatens the foundations of homes, factories, pipelines.
While the primary causes are debated, the effect is an engineering
nightmare no one anticipated when the towns were built, in Stalin's
time.

Coastal erosion is a problem in Alaska as well, forcing the United
States to prepare to relocate several Inuit villages at a projected
cost of $100 million or more for each one.

Across the Arctic, indigenous tribes with traditions shaped by
centuries of living in extremes of cold and ice are noticing changes in
weather and wildlife. They are trying to adapt, but it can be
confounding.

Take the Inuit word for June, qiqsuqqaqtuq. It refers to snow
conditions, a strong crust at night. Only those traits now appear in
May. Shari Gearheard, a climate researcher from Harvard, recalled the
appeal of an Inuit hunter, James Qillaq, for a new word at a recent
meeting in Canada.

One sentence stayed in her mind: &quot;June isn't really June any more.&quot;

Changing Traditions

In Finnmark, Norway's northernmost province, the Arctic landscape
unfolds in late winter as an endless snowy plateau, silent but for the
cries of the reindeer and the occasional whine of a snowmobile.

A changing Arctic is felt there, too. &quot;The reindeer are becoming
unhappy,&quot; said Issat Heandarat Eira, a 31-year-old reindeer herder and
one of 80,000 Samis, or Laplanders, who live in the northern reaches of
Scandinavia and Russia.

Few countries rival Norway when it comes to protecting the environment
and preserving indigenous customs. The state has lavished its oil
wealth on the region, and Sami culture has enjoyed something of a
renaissance. There is a Nordic Sami Institute, a Sami College, a
state-sponsored film festival and a drive-in theater where moviegoers
watch from snowmobiles.

And yet no amount of government support can convince Mr. Eira that his
livelihood, intractably entwined with the reindeer, is not about to
change. Like a Texas cattleman, he keeps the size of his herd secret.
But he said warmer temperatures in fall and spring were melting the top
layers of snow, which then refreeze as ice, making it harder for his
reindeer to dig through to the lichen they eat. He worries, too, about
the encroachment of highways and industrial activity on his once
isolated grazing lands.

&quot;The people who are making the decisions, they are living in the south
and they are living in towns,&quot; said Mr. Eira, sitting inside his home
made of reindeer hides. &quot;They don't mark the change of weather. It is
only people who live in nature and get resources from nature who mark
it.&quot;

Other Arctic cultures that rely on nature report similar disruptions.
For 5,000 years, the Inuit have lived on the fringe of the Arctic
Ocean, using sea ice as a highway, building material and hunting
platform. In recent decades, their old ways have been fading under
forced relocations, the erosion of language and lore and the lure of
modern conveniences, steady jobs and a cash economy.

Now the accelerating retreat of the sea ice is making it even harder to
preserve their connections to &quot;country food&quot; and tradition. In Canada,
Inuit hunters report that an increasing number of polar bears look
emaciated because the shrinking ice cover has curtailed their ability
to fatten up on seals. In Alaska, whale hunters working in unusually
open seas have seen walruses try to climb onto their white boats,
mistaking them for ice floes.

Hank Rogers, a 54-year-old Inuvialuit who helps patrol Canada's Far
North, said the pelts of fox, marten and other game he trapped were
thinning. As for the flesh of fish caught in coastal estuaries of the
Yukon, &quot;they're too mushy,&quot; he said. Slushy snow and weaker ice has
made traveling by snowmobile impossible in places.

&quot;The next generation coming up is not going to experience what we did,&quot;
he said. &quot;We can't pass the traditions on as our ancestors passed on to
us.&quot;

Even seasoned hunters have been betrayed by the thaw, stepping in snow
that should be covering ice but instead falling into water. And on
Shingle Point, a sandy strip inhabited by Inuvialuit at the tip of the
Yukon in Canada, Danny A. Gordon, 70, said it was troubling that fewer
icebergs were reaching the bay. It has become windier, too, for reasons
people here cannot explain.

&quot;In the summer 40 years ago, we had lots of icebergs, and you could
land your boat on them and climb on them even in summer,&quot; Mr. Gordon
said. &quot;Now in the winter they are tiny. The weather has changed.
Everyone knows it. It's global warming.&quot;

Sinking Cities

Vorkuta, a coal-mining city of 130,000, is crumbling.

Many of the city's homes and factories were built not on hard rock, but
on permafrost, a layer of perpetually frozen earth that covers 65
percent of Russia's territory. If the permafrost underneath melts, the
ground turns to mush.

&quot;Everything is falling apart,&quot; said Lyubov I. Denisova, who lives in a
cramped apartment on Lokomotivnaya Street. The ceiling has warped, the
walls cracked, the window frames splintered. Some buildings have been
declared unsafe and abandoned.

Vorkuta lies on the edge of Russia's permafrost boundary, and some
scientists predict that continued warming could advance that border
hundreds of miles northward, weakening the earth beneath the vast
infrastructure built during the days of the Soviet Union's
industrialization of the Arctic. According to the Permafrost Institute
in Yakutsk, the average temperature of the permafrost has already
increased a degree or two.

While most Arctic climate experts say the warming trend is driven by
heat-trapping emissions and is unlikely to reverse, many scientists and
officials in Russia predict the warming of the last 30 years will give
way to a new period of cold. Vorkuta's mayor, Igor I. Shpektor, hews to
that line. He said the damage in the city - 80 percent of all buildings
show signs of it, one study found - resulted from faulty construction
or maintenance, not a general thaw.

Still, Mr. Shpektor acknowledged, &quot;the permafrost is unforgiving.&quot;

Any significant warming, said Anatoly A. Chumashov, the city's chief
engineer, would leave officials like him scrambling to save the city.
&quot;It is an example of how fragile it is and how careful we should be,&quot;
he said. But he added: &quot;If the permafrost melts, this city will not
collapse overnight. There is time to adjust, but it requires very
serious investments in labor and money.&quot;

Spills and Depredation

&quot;One oil spill would be the end of us,&quot; said Borge Iversen, a fisherman
on the Lofoten Islands, a striking archipelago north of the Arctic
Circle in the Norwegian Sea.

As recently as 2000, Russian tankers were rarely spotted passing the
jagged peaks and sheltered inlets, surrounded by seas with the world's
largest stocks of cod and herring, as well as killer and sperm whales.
So far, there has not been a major accident, but the ships appear more
and more, a harbinger of Russia's expanding efforts to extract oil and,
increasingly, gas in the Arctic.

As much as a quarter of the world's remaining oil and gas resources are
believed to exist in the Arctic. And as technology improves, oil prices
rise and the seasonal ice cap retreats, countries like Norway and
Russia are acting with startling speed.

Oil shipments from the White Sea and the coast of the Barents Sea have
soared, said Mikhail M. Kalenchenko, director of the World Wildlife
Fund's branch in Murmansk, the Russian port.

&quot;It was supposed to increase over the next 10 years, up to 20 million
tons of oil,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 20 million this year,&quot; or 146 million
barrels. At this rate, he said, &quot;we can expect up to 100 million tons,
over 10 to 20 years, to be transported through our area.&quot;

Russia's history of environmental protection is a poor one. The Soviet
drive for industrial development paid little heed to the natural spaces
around its mines, factories and ports. Its disregard is evident in the
poisoned wasteland around the nickel smelter in Monchegorsk, south of
Murmansk, where hundreds of square miles of what was once forest is now
almost entirely devoid of life.

Western countries have paid millions to help Russia dismantle its aging
fleet of nuclear submarines in the area and safely store the nuclear
material aboard them, but Mr. Kalenchenko said far less attention had
been paid to the environmental risks of expanding oil shipments in the
same area, most in single-hull tankers.

&quot;What has never happened before is a big accident in the high seas in
the Artic,&quot; he said. For the entire Barents region, he said, Russia has
only two bases with the equipment necessary to fight an oil spill. &quot;In
Norway, they have at least 50 bases of this kind,&quot; he said.

David Dickins, an engineer from San Diego who has spent 30 years
studying how to clean up oil spills in icy waters, said that while the
ice impeded the use of tools like booms that hold a slick in place, the
ice also naturally contained the oil, giving response teams more time
to act before environmental damage occurred.

&quot;People ought not paint the Arctic in some sort of raving sense where a
spill is somehow going to be catastrophic,&quot; he said.

But he added: &quot;A spill is always serious. In the Arctic it will
naturally take longer to clean up because there is less wave action,
and breakdown is slower in colder temperatures.&quot;

That is what worries Mr. Iversen, who sails each morning from the
village of Ballstad, into the coastal waters around the Lofoten
Islands. The village's history, islanders say, reaches back to the
Vikings, and fishing is central to the region's social and economic
life.

&quot;We've fished these waters for centuries, and while it's a hard life,
we've survived in doing so,&quot; he said.

Although the fishing industry accounts for less than 1 percent of
Norway's gross domestic product, as against the nearly 18 percent
brought in by oil and gas, the fisheries are Norway's second-largest
earner of foreign exchange and are viewed as a more sustainable
resource.

&quot;We need a policy for the Arctic that considers the next 100 years, not
just the next 10 years,&quot; Mr. Iversen said.

Such sentiment goes far in Norway, where fishing is still part of the
oil-rich nation's soul. On Oct. 13, a new leftist coalition upheld a
ban on drilling in the waters around the Lofoten Islands until 2009,
while allowing exploration to proceed further north in the Barents Sea.
As for the tanker traffic, Oslo is looking at other ways of advancing
its concerns.

Norway and the seven other Arctic nations have started to discuss ways
to protect the environment they share in a forum called the Arctic
Council, established nine years ago. In 2002, the council issued
guidelines for offshore oil drilling, calling for drilling projects to
be preceded by studies on environmental effects and the availability of
cleanup equipment.

The guidelines come with no enforcement powers, but several experts say
they think they will have some effect, particularly because Russia is
preparing for entry into the World Trade Organization and seeking
closer ties with the European Union.

A Less Wild Future

One day last summer, the 1,200 residents of Pangnirtung, a windswept
outpost on a fjord in Nunavut, Canada's Inuit-administered Arctic
territory, were startled to see a 400-foot European cruise ship drop
anchor unannounced and send several hundred tourists ashore in small
boats.

While small ships have stopped in the Canadian Arctic, visits from
large liners are increasing as interest grows in the opening Northwest
Passage, said Maureen Bundgaard, chief executive of Nunavut Tourism, a
trade association.

Ms. Bundgaard has been training villagers how to stage cultural shows,
conduct day tours and sell crafts and traditional fare - without being
overrun. &quot;We're not prepared to deal with the huge ships, emotionally
or in other ways,&quot; she said.

Inuit leaders say they are trying to balance tradition with the
inevitable changes that are sweeping their lands. The Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, which represents 155,000 Inuit scattered across Canada,
Greenland, Russia and the United States, has enlisted lawyers and movie
stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Salma Hayek to draw attention to its
imperiled traditions.

The group's leaders hope to submit a petition to the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights in December, claiming that the United
States, by rejecting a treaty requiring other industrialized countries
to cut emissions linked to warming, is willfully threatening the
Inuit's right to exist.

The commission, an investigative arm of the Organization of American
States, has no enforcement powers. But legal analysts say that a
declaration that the United States has violated the Inuit's rights
could create the foundation for a lawsuit either against the United
States in international court or American companies in federal courts.

But some Inuit question the wisdom of the petition. They ask, how can
they push countries to stem global warming when the Inuit's own
prosperity in places like Nunavut is tied to revenues from oil and gas,
which are sources of greenhouse gases when burned?

Sheila Watt-Cloutier, the elected chairwoman of the group, said the
goal was not to stop development but to make sure that native cultures
had a say in how development was carried out.

&quot;It's how we do the business that's more important,&quot; she said. &quot;There
are more environmentally friendly ways in which we can do development
and still live a certain way, with a way of life and business that can
balance both.&quot; While it is the people of the Arctic who will feel the
melt and the rush for development most directly, the world, too, will
have to give up something - its treasured notion of the Far North as a
place of wilderness, simplicity and unspoiled cultures.

In a report on Arctic development, the United Nations Environment
Program estimated that 15 percent of the region's lands were affected
in 2001 by mining, oil and gas exploration, ports or other industrial
incursions. But that figure is likely to reach 80 percent in 2050, it
said. The Arctic, then, is probably making the same transition that
swept the coastal plains of the North Slope of Alaska starting 38 years
ago when the first oil was struck in Prudhoe Bay, said Charles
Wohlforth, an Alaskan and author of &quot;The Whale and the Supercomputer,&quot;
describing Arctic climate change.

Since then, a lacework of pipelines and wells has steadily spread west
and east from that central field, ending the sweeping sense of
emptiness that defined the Arctic landscape through the ages.

&quot;Even if you support oil development and think it makes sense, there's
a point at which it becomes West Texas or the Gulf of Mexico and is not
really the Arctic any more,&quot; Mr. Wohlforth said.
