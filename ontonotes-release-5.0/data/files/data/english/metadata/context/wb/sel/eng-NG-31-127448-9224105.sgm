The Magical Human Brain

Unlike a computer, the brain does not have the ability to instantly
scan a random series of locations in its memory. To do so would
require that every memory location be connected to every other
location, which is clearly not the case, biologically speaking.
Alternatively, it would require an address bus, a data bus, a memory
controller and RAM, much like a computer. This is not the case either.
Human memory does have a random access capability but it is extremely
slow compared to a computer: the axon of a neuron must grow until it
physically establishes a synaptic connection. And yet, amazingly,
human memory acts as if it does have instant random access capability.
For example, we can instantly record (memorize) any short sequence of
random musical notes and instantly recite it with no trouble even if
we have never heard or used that sequence before. How can this be? How
does the brain instantly record a random sequence of events that it
has never encountered before and play it back in the same order?

The act of recording a sequence of events presupposes the existence of
a recording medium. The only biologically plausible way to record and
play back a sequence of events is to use a control neuron that is
physically connected to all the neurons that represent the events in
the sequence. One can imagine using synaptic strengths to encode the
delays and a steady oscillatory firing of the control neuron to
trigger each node at its assigned time. One can even imagine using a
faster or slower oscillation frequency to play the sequence under
different tempos. The point I am driving at is that, in order for the
human brain to be able to instantly record and play back short random
melodies, it would need a pre-wired network of all such possible
sequences to serve as a universal medium. This is an extremely huge
number even if we limit the melodies to seven notes each, the capacity
of human short-term memory. If we include all the other possible event
sequences that human memory can instantly record, the number becomes
astronomical. There is no evidence for the existence of such an
immense pre-wired network. In fact, the evidence is that much of the
wiring of the brain occurs during learning. Is the brain using some
kind of magic to do its amazing tricks? The answer depends on what one
calls magic. I call it something else. I call it the spirit.

Hmmm.  So 'spirit' is required to explain the human brain.  I wonder
what explains the parrot brain.  Maybe parrots don't use spirit or
huge pre-wired networks.  Maybe they use Memorex.

That's not the point of the article. The point is that human
short-term memory has the ability to instantly record, not only random
melodies, but *any* type of random sequences of stimuli as well. An
animals' short term memory is limited in this respect because it is
genetically pre-wired for a narrow cognitive domain.

ahaha... This is getting funny. Obviously parrots have a huge

can't go much beyond repetitions and have a coherent conversation.
That requires an unlimited ability to record all sorts of random
sequences, not just sounds. That's the point of the article.

Having said that, I have to ask, are all atheists this dumb?

why are you lying to me? do you think i am stupid? this idiocy is

&gt; The act of recording a sequence of events presupposes the existence of

&gt; delays and a steady oscillatory firing of the control neuron to
&gt; trigger each node at its assigned time. One can even imagine using a
&gt; faster or slower oscillation frequency to play the sequence under

&gt; human brain to be able to instantly record and play back short random
&gt; melodies, it would need a pre-wired network of all such possible
&gt; sequences to serve as a universal medium. This is an extremely huge

&gt; astronomical. There is no evidence for the existence of such an
&gt; immense pre-wired network. In fact, the evidence is that much of the
&gt; wiring of the brain occurs during learning. Is the brain using some
&gt; kind of magic to do its amazing tricks? The answer depends on what one
&gt; calls magic. I call it something else. I call it the spirit.

So, when a computer, programmed to learn, learns to repeat a simple
sequence, it is using its spirit? When my cat learned to rattle the
screen door to get in, was she sorting thru a vast array of
possibilities that included screen doors, or was she using her spirit?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hmmm.  So 'spirit' is required to explain the human brain.  I wonder
&gt;&gt; &gt;what explains the parrot brain.  Maybe parrots don't use spirit or
&gt;&gt; &gt;huge pre-wired networks.  Maybe they use Memorex.

&gt;&gt; ahaha... This is getting funny. Obviously parrots have a huge
&gt;&gt; pre-wired network dedicated to sounds. But it's severely limited. They
&gt;&gt; can't go much beyond repetitions and have a coherent conversation.
&gt;&gt; That requires an unlimited ability to record all sorts of random
&gt;&gt; sequences, not just sounds. That's the point of the article.

&gt;so parrots have an unembodied spirit that is dedicated to sounds only,
&gt;but the human unembodied spirit is dedicated to more things?

Hey, Rainman! Why are you moving the goalposts over to a new field?
Are humans smarter than chimpanzees because they can lose in chess to
a computer, but a chimp can't?

The human brain is four times the size of a chimpanzee's brain. I
think that is a better explanation than making up a &quot;spirit&quot;. That
also explains why damaged, drunk or aged brains have less efficient
memories. Why should rohypnol affect a spirit's memory?

Some chemicals block the neurons from forming new dendritic
connections and keeps the brain from forming new memories. Short-term
memory is thought to be somewhat like the after-image when you look at
a bright object for a while, then look away.

There are far better explanation than desperate claims of a spirit.

You know this because you can recall everything?

Did you ever stop to think that your brain is actually failing to record
most of the data, but that you are simply not aware of what it failed to
record because your brain failed to record it?  You have no memory, and no
awareness, of what you brain is failing to recognize, and failing to
record, because of the fact your brain is failing to recognize it exists in
the first place.

It's quite trivial to do controlled experiments to show how little humans
are able to remember and how often they are wrong about what they are sure
happened.  Human memory is weak, inaccurate, and not magical in any sense.

The signals that flow in your brain is what you are aware of.  To
&quot;remember&quot; a past event, is nothing more than an act of the brain
duplicating some of the same signal patterns a second time (typically a
small subset of the original patterns).

To suggest this sort of power is magically is to suggest that it is
unreasonable for a signal processing machine to repeat the same temporal
pattern of signals twice.  That's just an odd thing to believe.

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://rebelscience.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-humans-are-smarter-than- ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Magical Human Brain

&gt; &gt;&gt; Unlike a computer, the brain does not have the ability to instantly
&gt; &gt;&gt; scan a random series of locations in its memory. To do so would
&gt; &gt;&gt; require that every memory location be connected to every other
&gt; &gt;&gt; location, which is clearly not the case, biologically speaking.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Alternatively, it would require an address bus, a data bus, a memory
&gt; &gt;&gt; controller and RAM, much like a computer. This is not the case either.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Human memory does have a random access capability but it is extremely
&gt; &gt;&gt; slow compared to a computer: the axon of a neuron must grow until it
&gt; &gt;&gt; physically establishes a synaptic connection. And yet, amazingly,
&gt; &gt;&gt; human memory acts as if it does have instant random access capability.
&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, we can instantly record (memorize) any short sequence of
&gt; &gt;&gt; random musical notes and instantly recite it with no trouble even if
&gt; &gt;&gt; we have never heard or used that sequence before. How can this be? How
&gt; &gt;&gt; does the brain instantly record a random sequence of events that it
&gt; &gt;&gt; has never encountered before and play it back in the same order?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The act of recording a sequence of events presupposes the existence of
&gt; &gt;&gt; a recording medium. The only biologically plausible way to record and
&gt; &gt;&gt; play back a sequence of events is to use a control neuron that is
&gt; &gt;&gt; physically connected to all the neurons that represent the events in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the sequence. One can imagine using synaptic strengths to encode the
&gt; &gt;&gt; delays and a steady oscillatory firing of the control neuron to
&gt; &gt;&gt; trigger each node at its assigned time. One can even imagine using a
&gt; &gt;&gt; faster or slower oscillation frequency to play the sequence under
&gt; &gt;&gt; different tempos. The point I am driving at is that, in order for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; human brain to be able to instantly record and play back short random
&gt; &gt;&gt; melodies, it would need a pre-wired network of all such possible
&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences to serve as a universal medium. This is an extremely huge
&gt; &gt;&gt; number even if we limit the melodies to seven notes each, the capacity
&gt; &gt;&gt; of human short-term memory. If we include all the other possible event
&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences that human memory can instantly record, the number becomes
&gt; &gt;&gt; astronomical. There is no evidence for the existence of such an

Louis, neurons, neourotransmitters, along with an understanding brain
structure and function do explain the dynamics of human memory. Short-
term memory is specifically linked most notably to the temporal lobe
and the hypothalamus. Individuals that have some defect in the brain,
either structural (such as atrophy of the hypothalamus) or chemical
(such as an imbalance of neurotransmitters) will suffer memory
problems. Are you thus trying to imply that the &quot;spirit&quot; rests in the
hypothalamus or that it is carried along on the back of dopamine or
serotonin. Although the mechanisms are not completely understood,
enough is known about memory processes to state there are anatomical
and physiological explanations for how it works. These anatomical and
physiological processes are shared in common with a great many other
organisms. Memory in other species with high cognitive power is also
quite impressive. Do they also have a &quot;spirit&quot; albeit one that may be
a bit slow.

Well, since the original post was pathetic, that's a step
forward.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Obviously parrots have a huge

I thought the point of the article was obvious: Make
assertions regarding how the brain &quot;must&quot; operate (even
though all the latest evidence shows it *doesn't* operate
that way), then use the implications derived from those

I don't think so. If one understands how neurons transmit signals and
how they form new connections (it's not rocket science), it is easy to
see that there is no possible way for human STM to have unlimited
instantaneous random access capability. That would require the use of
a memory controller and RAM. The brain does not work like a computer.

Isn´t it kind of sad that you falters even before you come to the

Actually what is described by you above is fairly uniterresting with
regard to the capabilities of the brain. What is interesting about the
brain is how it's able to form relationships between subjects in
recalling, i.e. associative memory, as this seems to be at the
fundation of concept formation.

You really know very very little about both computers and neurology,
don't you. Why do you find it interesting to expose you lack of

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Magical Human Brain

&gt; &gt;&gt; Unlike a computer, the brain does not have the ability to instantly

&gt; &gt;&gt; require that every memory location be connected to every other

&gt; &gt;&gt; Alternatively, it would require an address bus, a data bus, a memory
&gt; &gt;&gt; controller and RAM, much like a computer. This is not the case either.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Human memory does have a random access capability but it is extremely
&gt; &gt;&gt; slow compared to a computer: the axon of a neuron must grow until it
&gt; &gt;&gt; physically establishes a synaptic connection. And yet, amazingly,
&gt; &gt;&gt; human memory acts as if it does have instant random access capability.
&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, we can instantly record (memorize) any short sequence of
&gt; &gt;&gt; random musical notes and instantly recite it with no trouble even if
&gt; &gt;&gt; we have never heard or used that sequence before. How can this be? How
&gt; &gt;&gt; does the brain instantly record a random sequence of events that it
&gt; &gt;&gt; has never encountered before and play it back in the same order?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The act of recording a sequence of events presupposes the existence of
&gt; &gt;&gt; a recording medium. The only biologically plausible way to record and
&gt; &gt;&gt; play back a sequence of events is to use a control neuron that is
&gt; &gt;&gt; physically connected to all the neurons that represent the events in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the sequence. One can imagine using synaptic strengths to encode the
&gt; &gt;&gt; delays and a steady oscillatory firing of the control neuron to
&gt; &gt;&gt; trigger each node at its assigned time. One can even imagine using a
&gt; &gt;&gt; faster or slower oscillation frequency to play the sequence under
&gt; &gt;&gt; different tempos. The point I am driving at is that, in order for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; human brain to be able to instantly record and play back short random
&gt; &gt;&gt; melodies, it would need a pre-wired network of all such possible
&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences to serve as a universal medium. This is an extremely huge
&gt; &gt;&gt; number even if we limit the melodies to seven notes each, the capacity
&gt; &gt;&gt; of human short-term memory. If we include all the other possible event
&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences that human memory can instantly record, the number becomes
&gt; &gt;&gt; astronomical. There is no evidence for the existence of such an
&gt; &gt;&gt; immense pre-wired network. In fact, the evidence is that much of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; wiring of the brain occurs during learning. Is the brain using some
&gt; &gt;&gt; kind of magic to do its amazing tricks? The answer depends on what one
&gt; &gt;&gt; calls magic. I call it something else. I call it the spirit.

&gt; &gt;Hmmm.  So 'spirit' is required to explain the human brain.  I wonder
&gt; &gt;what explains the parrot brain.  Maybe parrots don't use spirit or
&gt; &gt;huge pre-wired networks.  Maybe they use Memorex.

&gt; ahaha... This is getting funny. Obviously parrots have a huge
&gt; pre-wired network dedicated to sounds. But it's severely limited. They
&gt; can't go much beyond repetitions and have a coherent conversation.

&gt; &gt;Fine...your work is almost complete...

&gt; &gt;Now, define what you refer to as &quot;spirit&quot;, and describe how this mechanism
&gt; &gt;physically manipulates brain chemistry.  Also, let us all know how we can
&gt; &gt;test your theory.  Be sure to show your work...

&gt; Are all of you atheists, autistic or something? Stay on topic,

Oh, but it *does*, sweetie.  You said the only explanation was
something called &quot;the spirit.&quot;  You don't just get to assert that and
get off scot-free.  If you think &quot;the spirit&quot; does it, you have to
define &quot;spirit&quot; and explain it's composition and how it makes the
brain work.  *You* opened the door.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It has to do with the fact

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The Magical Human Brain

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unlike a computer, the brain does not have the ability to instantly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; scan a random series of locations in its memory. To do so would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; require that every memory location be connected to every other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; location, which is clearly not the case, biologically speaking.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Alternatively, it would require an address bus, a data bus, a memory
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; controller and RAM, much like a computer. This is not the case either.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Human memory does have a random access capability but it is extremely
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slow compared to a computer: the axon of a neuron must grow until it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physically establishes a synaptic connection. And yet, amazingly,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human memory acts as if it does have instant random access capability.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, we can instantly record (memorize) any short sequence of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; random musical notes and instantly recite it with no trouble even if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we have never heard or used that sequence before. How can this be? How
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; does the brain instantly record a random sequence of events that it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has never encountered before and play it back in the same order?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The act of recording a sequence of events presupposes the existence of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a recording medium. The only biologically plausible way to record and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; play back a sequence of events is to use a control neuron that is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physically connected to all the neurons that represent the events in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the sequence. One can imagine using synaptic strengths to encode the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; delays and a steady oscillatory firing of the control neuron to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trigger each node at its assigned time. One can even imagine using a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faster or slower oscillation frequency to play the sequence under
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; different tempos. The point I am driving at is that, in order for the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human brain to be able to instantly record and play back short random
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; melodies, it would need a pre-wired network of all such possible
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences to serve as a universal medium. This is an extremely huge
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; number even if we limit the melodies to seven notes each, the capacity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of human short-term memory. If we include all the other possible event
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sequences that human memory can instantly record, the number becomes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astronomical. There is no evidence for the existence of such an

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; calls magic. I call it something else. I call it the spirit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;So, when a computer, programmed to learn, learns to repeat a simple
&gt;&gt; &gt;sequence, it is using its spirit? When my cat learned to rattle the
&gt;&gt; &gt;screen door to get in, was she sorting thru a vast array of
&gt;&gt; &gt;possibilities that included screen doors, or was she using her spirit?

&gt;&gt; Another shit-for-brains atheist. Is there a factory around somewhere?
&gt;&gt; ahahaha...

&gt;Out of ammunition, are you?  Can't come up with a coherent argument to
&gt;anwer Kermit?  Man, you didn't last long.

&gt;&gt;no need to go into whats wrong with his &quot;understanding&quot; of how memory
&gt;&gt;works, because what kind of idiot isnt aware that some animals can
&gt;&gt;memorize and play back music too?

&gt; That's not the point of the article. The point is that human
&gt; short-term memory has the ability to instantly record, not only random
&gt; melodies, but *any* type of random sequences of stimuli as well. An
&gt; animals' short term memory is limited in this respect because it is
&gt; genetically pre-wired for a narrow cognitive domain.
