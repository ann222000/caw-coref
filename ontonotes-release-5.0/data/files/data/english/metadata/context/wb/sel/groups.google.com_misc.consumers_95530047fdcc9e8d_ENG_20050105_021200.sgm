It's an irritant, but the level these things generate is considered
to be safe.

There's no way to get rid of it, so if it really bothers you, you
should return the unit.

i bought one yep $350 sucker here

but it works for me i used some string and hooks and have is right
over my headboard of my bed and it does make me breath easier

but as is doesnt move enought air to fill a garbage bag it is not
useful to clean the air of a room of any size over a cubic yard

it takes about two weeks to get a pile of crud on the plates unless
you burn candles which will turn the grey unit black almost instantly

and if you want to see it work you need to tie a strin of tinsel on
the front

you cant use a ribbon or string cause its flow is so low

i can't really say if it was a complete waste it did help one day when
there was a forrest fire nearby and it cleaned the air over my face
while i slept

every other one is way too loud to sleep with one on and thats when i
need one most

also its not completely silent after a day or so after cleaning it
starts making a pooooo,second of silence,zzz,poooooo,second of
silenceover and over

its really quiet but i have really good ears i can hear my swatch
ticking acros the room`

&gt;What do you think &quot;placebo effect&quot; means???

"/> Kind of thought you would post without thinking. From the Scientific
American web site: &quot;The concept of a placebo effect, by which patients GET
BETTER from the mere illusion of treatment, has intrigued scientists since
it was first proposed in 1955. &quot;

Notice the patient gets better, which is different that imagining getting
better.

From Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary: &quot;improvement in the condition of a
patient that occurs in response to treatment but cannot be considered due
to the specific treatment used&quot;

i feel a slight cool breeze on my face when it is a foot above me
aiming down on me

and i notice my pile of kleenex it smaller in the morning near the
trashcan

so maybe there is 2 on the floor as opposed to 4 every night without it

and it does seem to attract black gunk alot better than my tv set

I have tested the ionic breeze 3.0 for a few days and found it just
DOES NOT work , My computer fan picked up more dust , cat hair and
pollen in the same time period and uses even less power then the 6 watt
ionic breeze , Im not sure how this product ended up on so many store
floors , but I would not pay $50 let alone $299 which was the price at
Costco , this product is being made in china for $16 , why rip off all
of America at such high costs for a product that just does NOT work.

I also have a Hepa Filter system , uses a litte more power and needs
filters but I could run it for over 10 years , at the cost of the ionic
breeze, so there claim of costing you less is just BS

IMO, any product that requires a lot of selling probably doesn't work very
well. And if the word &quot;amazing&quot; is used in the selling, it is even useless.

Hello :

Consumer Reports says this Ionic Breeze : It is a piece of JUNK. Here
is what consumer reports says.

THE BOTTOM LINE

The Ionic Breeze and the Environizer are quiet but ineffective. A
comparable product, the Hoover SilentAir 4000, performed poorly in our
standard test; we chose not to put it through any extended trials.
Considering how slowly these three products worked, our advice is to
avoid all three. There are much better choices.

Also they tried to intimidate Consumer Reports for honest reporting.
IONIC BREEZE are bunch of THUGS - DISHONEST MARKETERS. ONLY THING THEY
DO IS TAKE YOUR MONEY AWAY AND GIVE YOU PIECE OF JUNK.

Consumer Reports' ability to publish its expert findings without the
fear of being crushed by wealthy corporate interests that disagree with
them. In 2003, The Sharper Image tried to silence us by filing a
product disparagement lawsuit in California after we rated the
company's Ionic Breeze Quadra air cleaner &quot;ineffective.&quot; We
fought back. We filed a motion to strike the suit under California's
Anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) statute.
Such statutes protect against meritless lawsuits designed to chill
constitutional rights, particularly the right to free speech.

I'm proud to say that we prevailed.The U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California dismissed the case, rejecting all of
Sharper Image's claims and thereby powerfully affirming Consumers
Union's reputation as an objective, unbiased testing organization.
Under California's Anti-SLAPP statute, CU is now entitled to
reimbursement for legal fees and expenses incurred in its defense. So,
not only did we win, but we won with a decision that sends a strong
message to deep-pocketed interests, who should think twice before
dragging honest critics to court.

Jimmy
