Hi all.

I've just traded-in my 406 for a 2004 model 407 which has the built-in
colour satnav system. I've been playing around with it for a few days, and
as I understand it there are two stored lists of destinations - the
"previous destinations" list and the "directory" list.

My problem is that these are cluttered up with locations put in by the
previous owner. I've read the manual and worked through the on-screen menus,
but as far as I can see there's no way of deleting any of these. Am I right,
or have I just missed something? If anyone can tell me how to delete
locations from these stored lists I'd be grateful. I wondered about putting
the telematics system disc in the CD drive, thinking maybe this might
re-initialise the whole system, but there's so little information about what
this disc actually does I don't like to chance it. All the booklet seems to
say is "put the disc in and let it run - it'll take about 10 minutes". But
*what* it does, it doesn't say. Can anybody help?

Lastly, am I just being paranoid about the potential security risk of not
being able to delete stored locations? If someone sees my family walk away
from the car and then nicks it, all they've got to do is look for "home"
among the stored destinations and the car will take them right to the door
of my empty house. Also if/when I sell it on, I don't really want the next
owner to have a list of all the places I've navigated to. Yes, maybe I'm
just paranoid, but .....

TIA

Snipped for brevity.

I have recently bought a 406 estate also with Sat Nav and
was surprised to find the previous owner had left all his
data on. I have now removed it all. However the disc with
the system is the 2000- 2002 edition so I have ordered the
2005-2006 disc which I understand has the post codes ( UK )
cost £125.00 which I thought was far too expensive, but what
can you do, if you want it, that's the price. This is my
first Peugeot and I must say I am more than pleasantly
surprised by it, a really nice car, it is the estate version
110 diesel, I just can't believe the fuel consumption 42-44
mpg and the performance, I would not have believed possible
for a diesel, it goes like a rocket. The only problem I have
is, I need a 2 week course to work out what everything does,
it's an electronic wilderness.

_____________________________________

How did you remove the previous owner's data, Bryan?

When you get your new disc, I'd be interested to know what's new - you
suggest postcodes, for one. Mine's the 2003/4 disc, and doesn't have
postcodes, AFAIK. I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be a way of seeing the
complete route the system will follow once you've entered a destination, nor
a way to specify a destination with specific points you want the route to
take you via.

Cheers

If there is a simple way I haven't found it, but the lists are only so long
so, once they are full, if you put a new address on top, an old one will
drop off the bottom.
One way to clear your stuff off when you sell the car would be to load
enough fictitious names to do the trick.

Would that 6.6 software fix those bugs people were having with "miles to
service"? When their miles were suddenly dropping.

Thanks for the various suggestions.

I think I've got version 5.23. Where do you get the updated software -
dealer, direct order ?

yeah your dealer

it has some advantages and some bugs.
the goodthings are; mp3 payback on the unit, dynamic TMC navigation, the
AUX audio part keeps on working while driving, so you can hook up a
external audio source.
some bugs; the SMS wont work no more....the first 20 min after a call
the ringtone wont work nomore, solve this by pressing the voice-command
key 2 times....and some ppl complain about that the radio frequency's
are messing up...

:) so still italian....fix one big and create another one.....

I have posted several discussions on this forum
With regard to your question, I have not found a way of clearing the
list but a simple security tip is to not use recognisable short names
in the directory.  Don't call home "home" but give it some cryptic
acronym only meaningful to you.  Also when storing telephone numbers
and using voice commands - dont use the word "home" or "office".
Obvious I know but it works.

By the way of you can find a way to make the compass display rather
than the aircon window then tell us as there are many of us who just
cant solve that problem.

Happy 407 driving - great car but with a few idiosyncracies!

I've found the answer to part of my original question - deleting directory
entries.

My system is Magneti Marelli v5.23. On the main telematics menu there's a
"Directory" option. From there, select "Manage Directory Records" and you'll
find "Delete" among the options.

Works for me!

Haven't found a way to clean up the "Previous Destinations" yet.
