How do they do it?

Yesterday I was with DD at an audition (college admission related).
Knowing that I'd be sitting around awhile, of course I brought a little
project, and the waiting time maybe didn't quite fly, but at least
wasn't painful to me. But I was amazed at how many people just
SAT....staring into space, waiting, waiting...few books, projects,
newspapers, or anything. Many were bored and used cell phones as
entertainment ("hi, I'm waiting for her, she text messaged me and she's
finished with dance and on her way into the singing part..."). (Parents
were barred from the audition area, but in the age of cell phones/text
messages, nobody can cut off communication!) Just a weird kind of day,
that nobody else in this group of at least a hundred parents had any
kind of project going or apparent plan for passing time.

I was lucky. DD was done in about 3 hours (and I made some progress on a
Christmas ornament for next year). But others still had 2-3 hours more
to wait!

I don't know and I think that I don't want to know! I'd have brought a book
at the very least. More likely, I'd have had a book or two, some knitting
and some stitching.

Mom used to ask the same thing when she went to jury duty.  The women
would bring knitting and crossword puzzle books.  The men would bring
the newspaper and by 10 AM would be bored and staring off into space.

I suppose some people really don't have any portable hobbies/interests.
There are also some who like the break from the normal stress of life
and don't mind vegging for a few hours.  It might be years before they
get to do that again!  It is also possible they have in earbuds and have
a portable audio device playing and you don't know it.  And then there
are those who just can't believe they would actually be made to wait
anywhere for anything so why plan for it!

I always wonder the same thing - at doctor's offices, school events and
especially airports. I always have at least 1 stitching project and 2
paperback books with me in case I get stuck for hours.  I can't seem to
stand more than 5 minutes of "nothing".  Even at home I watch TV while
stitching.
I sometimes think maybe they are just dull boring people - but that sounds
mean, but how can you just sit like a rock for hours?

Huh?  I often like to have something along to do, but I
would be more inclined to say the exact opposite--how could
anyone *not* be able to occupy themselves with their thoughts
for any significant amount of time?
I like to make good use of my time, and like to leverage
time spent waiting on doing something productive, but I wouldn't
say it's a problem not to have something to do while waiting.
There's always plenty to think about and consider.

Best wishes,

Has anyone ever wondered whether it's because we're easily bored and
impatient that we do needlework, or read or do some sort of busy work so
much of the time?  Maybe those people who are content to just sit staring
into space are more docile and content by nature than we are.  I sometimes
suspect that if I were born further into the century than I was I might have
been diagnosed as having some form of ADD.  According to my parents I was
never able to sit still for long and I was often in trouble in school for
that.

I know that I get antsy at the movies and nearly always think they're too
long, but I can watch the same thing on TV at home as long as I have
something else to do at the same time.  Sometimes that something is reading.
Then I can kind of absorb enough of the story on TV to follow it and only
look up when there is something exciting, or noisy happening on screen.

How many of us are satisfied just to veg out?

There is the opposite argument, that if you have to have an external
means of entertainment, then you must have a dull, boring internal
life....  I'm not very good at it, but I do know people who are
perfectly content to just sit and think for a few hours.  DH invents
things when he has to wait.

Absolutely.  I'll be sitting next to someone who's waiting patiently for
the doctor/train/lecturer to get there, and they'll point to my
needlework "I would never have the patience to do that".  I always point
out that I do needlework because I would never have the patience to wait
if I didn't have something to do.

If I for some reason get off without something to work on, I get
incredibly fidgety.  Mind you, the trolley runs every 15 minutes, so I'm
not waiting all that long for it to arrive, but it's enough to run me
out of patience waiting without a distraction.

Well, I do both! If I have a doctors appointment or whatever, I have a
paperback to read. When I fly, I bring a stitchy project, but usually
can't get the needle to find the hole too well with the movement. I read
a paperback intermittently, and other times I just think!

The long flight from Orlando to Tokyo, via Dallas, was rough. I read
about half my book, but the interest palls after a long period of time.
I brought along two stitchy projects,( over two on 18ct)  but either the
light was bad, or the plane bounced. In the end I just vegetated, put
the mind on "thought" process. and let the time fly by. I can't sleep on
planes, and I find it hard to concentrate on movies.

&gt; They are always such awful movies I find - but then since I rarely go

&gt; I take one of those masks, I find that makes it easier to sleep.  It's
&gt; dark behind the mask and I can believe nobody else is around.

You should have seen me!! I selected a seat at the rear of the plane,
near the loo, but by the aisle so I could stretch my legs. The plan was
to be away from noise and kids. To a certain extent it was a good move.
I got to know the staff, and they plied me with red wine (free) to help
me sleep!! I put in my earplugs, and wore my sunglasses. I managed two
or three one-hour naps!

I got to Tokyo, next day, a weird time, DS and DDIL drove me two hours
to where they lives. It was about 8pm their time.

"Mom, you have to come to the club with us for a couple of hours, every
one wants to meet you."

Several Japanese beers later, no sleep for nearly 36 hrs, I felt cold
sober, and slept until 8am their time!!

Oh well, lat time I will have that great opportunity!

&gt;&gt; How do they do it?

&gt;&gt; Yesterday I was with DD at an audition (college admission related).
&gt;&gt; Knowing that I'd be sitting around awhile, of course I brought a little
&gt;&gt; project, and the waiting time maybe didn't quite fly, but at least wasn't
&gt;&gt; painful to me. But I was amazed at how many people just SAT....staring
&gt;&gt; into space, waiting, waiting...few books, projects, newspapers, or
&gt;&gt; anything. Many were bored and used cell phones as entertainment (&quot;hi, I'm
&gt;&gt; waiting for her, she text messaged me and she's finished with dance and
&gt;&gt; on her way into the singing part...&quot;). (Parents were barred from the
&gt;&gt; audition area, but in the age of cell phones/text messages, nobody can
&gt;&gt; cut off communication!) Just a weird kind of day, that nobody else in
&gt;&gt; this group of at least a hundred parents had any kind of project going or
&gt;&gt; apparent plan for passing time.

&gt;&gt; I was lucky. DD was done in about 3 hours (and I made some progress on a
&gt;&gt; Christmas ornament for next year). But others still had 2-3 hours more to
&gt;&gt; wait!

&gt; Has anyone ever wondered whether it's because we're easily bored and
&gt; impatient that we do needlework, or read or do some sort of busy work so
&gt; much of the time?  Maybe those people who are content to just sit staring
&gt; into space are more docile and content by nature than we are.  I sometimes
&gt; suspect that if I were born further into the century than I was I might
&gt; have been diagnosed as having some form of ADD.  According to my parents I
&gt; was never able to sit still for long and I was often in trouble in school
&gt; for that.

&gt; I know that I get antsy at the movies and nearly always think they're too
&gt; long, but I can watch the same thing on TV at home as long as I have
&gt; something else to do at the same time.  Sometimes that something is
&gt; reading. Then I can kind of absorb enough of the story on TV to follow it
&gt; and only look up when there is something exciting, or noisy happening on
&gt; screen.

&gt; How many of us are satisfied just to veg out?

&gt; Lucille
">

I watch TV that way too - my DH says I watch with the "top of my head"  :)

I'm feel that I'm impatient and always busy but find I have infinite
patience for needlework - small and detailed, and I love to bake and
decorate detailed cookies too.   And I spend countless hours in my veggie
garden in the 3 warmer seasons of the year - sometimes pulling weeds but
often just watching birds -  and I love to hike and walk and just enjoy the
scenery....but just sitting, esp. waiting for something/someone drives me
bonkers!

The last time we went to the cinema was many, many years ago. We were
put off by people talking throughout the film, by the continual rustle
of food-wrappers, the loud chomping of food, the slurping of soft drinks
and by the dreadful aroma of burgers, pop-corn &amp; other assorted fast
"food" items. I suppose folk do this at home when watching the Idiot's
Lantern and fail to realise that the cinema requires different behaviour.

Amen to that! The only thing that comes close is to pop it fresh and pour a
ton of melted butter over it!!

You have to pop it in an oil blend containing coconut oil.  That is part
of the theatre flavor secret.  It is also far more fattening than other
oils.

When I had no children, I would take one of three approaches depending
on the circumstance.

1) Read whatever book I have stashed in my purse for just such emergencies.

2) Daydream.  I think up lots of stuff this way and if it looks like
it's not going to be a long wait, I won't bother with the book.

3) Write.  I clean out my brain on a regular basis so I always have to
have paper and pencil on hand.

I never, ever took stitching projects anywhere except on the bus to work
(which was the main reason I rode the bus to work), because I have a
getting-out ritual and a putting-back ritual, and those just take too
much time.

Now that I have young children, I'm always chasing after them or
teaching them something, so it doesn't matter if I brought anything--it
won't get used.  Also, we don't wait long at most of the places I go.
Whether it's luck, good business on the part of doctors et al, or
learned timing, I don't know.  (Well, I DO know to go to the post office
between 12:45 and 1:15.)

The only way I GET to read books now is in the bathroom.  The days of
sitting in a chair for a weekend reading the whole of a monster book are
gonegonegone.

However, if I were going on a long trip (especially in the winter with
the threat of places being closed/shut down on account of weather), I
wouldn't be caught dead without my stitching bag and a book or two.

&gt; Yesterday I was with DD at an audition (college admission related).
&gt; Knowing that I'd be sitting around awhile, of course I brought a little
&gt; project, and the waiting time maybe didn't quite fly, but at least
&gt; wasn't painful to me. But I was amazed at how many people just
&gt; SAT....staring into space, waiting, waiting...few books, projects,
&gt; newspapers, or anything. Many were bored and used cell phones as
&gt; entertainment (&quot;hi, I'm waiting for her, she text messaged me and she's
&gt; finished with dance and on her way into the singing part...&quot;). (Parents
&gt; were barred from the audition area, but in the age of cell phones/text
&gt; messages, nobody can cut off communication!) Just a weird kind of day,
&gt; that nobody else in this group of at least a hundred parents had any

It does make you wonder.  I think just lots of people tend to zone out.  Or
rixate on cell phones.

&gt; I was lucky. DD was done in about 3 hours (and I made some progress on a
&gt; Christmas ornament for next year). But others still had 2-3 hours more

How'd it go?  And glad you kept yourself entertained.

&gt; Has anyone ever wondered whether it's because we're easily bored and
&gt; impatient that we do needlework, or read or do some sort of busy work so
&gt; much of the time?  Maybe those people who are content to just sit staring
&gt; into space are more docile and content by nature than we are.  I sometimes
&gt; suspect that if I were born further into the century than I was I might have
&gt; been diagnosed as having some form of ADD.  According to my parents I was
&gt; never able to sit still for long and I was often in trouble in school for
&gt; that.

&gt; I know that I get antsy at the movies and nearly always think they're too
&gt; long, but I can watch the same thing on TV at home as long as I have
&gt; something else to do at the same time.  Sometimes that something is reading.
&gt; Then I can kind of absorb enough of the story on TV to follow it and only
&gt; look up when there is something exciting, or noisy happening on screen.

&gt; How many of us are satisfied just to veg out?
">

I think it's just some people get restless, or need some stimulation.  For
me, honestly, a bit like Erika - I can just sit and ponder. But, in general
I'm not good at being still for much time.  And as my personality is a
multi-tasker (used to think I was time-sharing my brain in the way that
computers work - they go round from task to task kind of) so it's just
better for me to be doing something with my hands, etc.

The knitting at the hockey games - at the pro ones anyhow - is newish for
me. But, I'm much happier - even though there is lots going on, and we're
right there with the banging glass, and friends around - I find that if I'm
knitting I'm happier - nothing too complicated.  So, I don't know that it's
boredom, just being happier doing something.

I do know people (my crazy extended family aunt for one) that must be
entertained all the time - and cannot just be by themselves.  That's a
different thing.  Personally, I think that's some kind of unhappiness with
life, or self, and she's someone that is constantly needing somebody to "go
do something" with her.  For me, while I tend to be "doing something" I'm
fine just by myself.  It's the people that just can't be alone, or honestly
be still at all that would concern me or have my sympathy or something.

I think it's just for some of us how our attention spans run, and what keeps
your interest at what level, etc.  You may have been bored in school a bit,
so needed more stimulus and thus were restless.

&gt; There is the opposite argument, that if you have to have an external

&gt; life....  I'm not very good at it, but I do know people who are
&gt; perfectly content to just sit and think for a few hours.  DH invents

That's good.  I tend to write something or sketch.  I'm having to repeat a
class - because a lab that I dropped was rolled into this class - which I
already took for 4 credits and an A.  Plus, the dept chair makes all the
instructors use the canned slides from the text company - so it's very, very
boring - meaning the slides are from the book.  It's an important class
Medical Emergency stuff for paramedics (as opposed to trauma, etc). 2 hour
lab, hour break, then 3 hour lecture.  I am going nuts about 15 min into
this (if that long).  But, attendance and participation count. There is no
way I could knit or stitch in class - she'd kill me.  Very, very strict with
the grades person.  So, I ended up sketching the tableau of the room front
in the last class.  I think I'm going to start bringing a sketch pad and
some pencils and just do that - it won't be too obvious (I hope) and at
least isn't distracting to others.  And I could still keep the text open -
literally I just hit stuff with an extra highlighter star to note things.
Yuck.

At least I don't do math problems in my head anymore.  The other thing I
used to do in class is take notes in another language.  Hmmm - maybe I'll
start that.
