I hope the group will pardon a newbie question about the
importance of establishing provenance, more as a matter of
historical interest than in establishing value.

We recently inherited the big Victorian &quot;cottage&quot; my
husband's grandparents bought in 1912. It came down from
them to my husband's mother, who recently died at 79, and
hence to us. My husband has lived here for his 50 years, and
I've been here since we married 15 years ago. The place is
full of Victorian furniture and knick-knacks, and my
mother-in-law taught me quite a lot about what's what in
Victoriana. At times I've felt like the curator-in-training
of a small museum :-)

I'm now beginning to catalogue things, more for family
interest than to sell them, and I'm running up against
questions of provenance. For some of the items, we can
establish clear provenance through things like the list of
my husband's grandparents' wedding gifts, the tag on the
back of the piano (always assuming it wasn't transferred
from another, older piano), or the date the framer
scribbled on the back of an etching. For others, we have no
information except my mother-on-law's anecdotes (&quot;Oh yes,
Gramma bought that carpet at an auction house in Atlantic
City in 1926&quot; kind of thing).

I don't mind the job of curatorship, but I'm getting lost
in detail without knowing what to spend my time on, and
what's a waste of time. My question is, what's good enough
to establish provenance? Are anecdotes about where/when
something was bought sufficient? Is it enough (for another
example) that I have a photograph taken in 1946 of a settee
that's still sitting in the exact same spot in the house?
Or that the dining room chairs have women's names written on
the bottom of each, to designate the long-gone aunt who
needle-pointed the cover?

Sorry for the length of this. I've probably given way too
much information, but I have a feeling I'm in very deep
water here for a beginner. A few suggestions about reliable
books or websites would be very welcome. Thanks.

"/>  If they can be backed up by proof the supposed buyer had
opportunity to buy the piece under the conditions of the
anecdote. If family legend has it that great-uncle Alfie brought
back the rhino-foot umbrella stand from his stint as a missionary
in Africa, you have to show that he REALLY was a missionary in
Africa. If your research shows that Alfie spent his days
hustling pool Detroit ... anecdote is bad.

Good points already made by Psued and Jon.
I think part of the answer to your question &quot;what is good enough
to establish provenance&quot; will be answered by the question-
Who is it for?
If it is for the grandchildren etc., then the family story should
suffice without any kind of hard evidence.

On the other hand, family stories do turn out to be incorrect
or untrue in many cases.
My old grandmother has been known to tell a tall tale or two. ;)

And remember, often assumptions lead to error. Probably the most
common one made is that people think that just because something
belonged to their grandmother, it must be old. This happens all the
time.

So, the value of what we are told about things, I guess I am trying to
say, is of dubious value. In the end, there is no substitute for
learning
what's what.

Evelyn, you can never have &quot;too much information&quot; when it comes to
family history!

I certainly don't have all your answers, and I'm sure others will chime
in with their thoughts, but my first suggestion is to leave all those
tags and names attached to the furniture and what-nots. But you might
want to catalog every thing you do know in one place... if the info is
&quot;anecdotal&quot; make a note, if it's from the wedding lists or photos, keep
them with the other info (definitely in an acid-free binder). And don't
be afraid to add new pictures of everything to the book (and sending
copies to your homeowner's insurance agent wouldn't hurt either). &lt;grin&gt;

On items like the chairs, add any info you know into your book - dates
of birth/death of your great-aunts will help give a time frame for their
needlepoint, how they're related to you and your family, etc. If the
house and furnishings were appraised when you inherited them, keep that
info with everything else too.

As to how much to catalog and where to stop, that's up to you - it can
become a life long passion if you want it to be! There are many good
books out there on how to care for your antiques, or books that can help
you ID a time period for that odd bit of furniture stashed in the attic,
and some good pottery, porcelain and glass books can help you with the
knick-knacks.

You can also take photos and post them on your web site. If you have
questions on some of them, post the URLs here and we'll all have a peek
at your stuff!

Good luck, Michele

A short cut way to do this might be with a video camera. If you talk
about what you know about each piece while you film it you will have a nice
basic record. Then you could go from there and get as detailed as you want.
Just remember to store a copy in your safety deposit box.

by the 'famous' Duke of Wellington and had a proven 'provenance' that
added (slightly) to its value. Otherwise it is all just background
history..

merely means &quot;the fact of coming from some particular source or
quarter&quot;. The definition says nothing about getting an owner's
pedigree, family arms, or appraising the value of a piece before
&quot;past history&quot; can be considered &quot;provenance&quot;.

"/> I do know what its general definition is, but it is a technical term
in antiques and auction houses, at least here in the UK, and is used
to denote proof of importance of ownership or craftsman.

If you see the UK Antiques Roadshow they ask if the owner of an
ordinary piece has any &quot;history&quot; of the item. If the person is
claiming they have a piece of Napolean's hair taken from his deathbed
placed in a gold locket and given to a faithful servant...they then
start talking about 'provenance'.

Your BB definately does NOT have provenance in this manner,unless your
cryptic name is hiding a very famous one !!!!

For fun .. here's a picture from a Sotheby's estate sale, and you'll
agree, a load of old kitsch junk if ever there was, this was the part
contents of the kitchen. If it had been my junk or Jon's junk or even T's
junk, Sotherby's would probably have told our executors to piss off on
down the street to the local flea.

But oh no!! this junk was embraced by Sotheby's with all the hype they
could muster, with full coloured catalogue, TV and media press coverage
and in the end, silly ridiculous prices. Why? simply because of
provenance ... the former property and estate of Andy Warhol ... viewing
at the time: Frankfurt, 10th-12th March; Cologne, 15th-17th March;
London, 24th-28th March; and Tokyo, 31st March - 5th April with the sale
finally ending in New York between 23th April-3rd May.

Of course there were a few good things as well. :)))

"/> Btw Jon, did you catch the TV programme on Sir Anthony Van Dyck last
evening ... brilliant programme?

For our American cousins, there is a major exhibition being staged and
planned at the Royal Academy of Anthony Van Dyck's portraiture work, a
mammoth under-taking, bringing together from all over the world Van
Dyck's major works, some being seen for the first time since he painted
them.

The programme showed a major work being removed from the Earl Spencer's
house (the former Lady Diana's family home) this was the first time that
the painting has left the home. Painted by Van Dyck's some 300+ years ago
and still with the same family.

Now that's provenance. :))

Well, I was thinking more of a family archive sort of thing, but you have a
point. I expect there will be ways to convert old formats to new as they come
along...I mean nobody has 8 mm projectors anymore (except my shop....need one?
It's cheap.), but there are folks who put the 8 mm image on to VHS.
Of course the same problem exists with computers. I guess paper is the
answer, but despite some fine quotes that people here can find, the fact is that
it doesn't always last either. What to do? What do folks suggest to create
lasting information?

Ronnie,
I think you are going to hear from several of us that would have
loved to have gotten our hands on that load of shite. Gotta pay the rent.
I think that most of that style was already popular before this sale,
but these things became cemented in popularity after the Wahol sale and the
media frenzy that surrounded it. And he sure brought the cookie jar
collectors out of the wood work! The difference between this mega-sale and
some others may be that while the average gal isn't ever gonna get her hands
on the Duchess of Windsors jewels, or Jackie Onassis's stuff that fact is
that you CAN get dishes like Wahols. What's more you can use the stuff and
display it. I mean really, how often can you wear that diamond encrusted
leopard pin?
See, we don't have products with &quot;this brand used by the royal family&quot;
plastered all over it. So what's a poor little social climber to do?
I am digressing from providence...it's just that common lament, &quot;We
ain't gone no history&quot;, so we grab it where we can. And we aren't to fussy.
:-)

We onetime had a very interesting piece in the NY Times about this

At least with the jewels and the costume paste of the Duchess of Windsor
one could have removed the provenance and the objects would have still
had serious merit, because the object itself had merit to start with, and
so in that case it wasn't solely dependent upon a provenance, but the
provenance did boost and hype the sale. :)

I know that I went off topic so to speak, I don't disagree with what you
are saying about provenance at all. I didn't get any cookie jars at all
(sob), but I did sell a cookbook ABOUT the Warhol cookie jars. So I guess it
does trickle down.
I think the provenance part is really brought home when you see those
creepy e-bay sales of 'special dirt' or that creeps Buttafucco's car.
Guess I'm in no danger of getting rich that way. At least I hope not!

"/> Is that a question Jane, or a statement? .. I suppose much like the
Nanking cargo. :)

I believe Warhol was not so much a collector but a hoarder, keeping
virtually anything, plastic shopping bags and empty cartons nearly taped
and dated, which in turn were crammed with everything from valuable
documents, fan-mail, junk mail, back numbers of Hola! and all manner of
rubbish. He even contemplated packaging all this rubbish into metal boxes
to be known as 'Warhol's time-bombs' .. to Warhol, every last scrap of
rubbish had validity by virtue of being memorabilia. His drawing-room was
fitted out with a fine collection of Federal furniture and in the Federal
style, no expense spared, he never actually used the room, as with the
dinning-room, all decorated and finely furnished then just left
uninhabited. It is reported over the years these two 'state' rooms came
to be used primarily as storage space. At first a few crates and paper
bags, but by the time he died, phase after phase of collecting fad
crammed the rooms out and the entire house. In the end he let his
'collections' take over and withdrew to his bedroom and kitchen.

One man's shite is another man's obsession, or should that be the other
way around? :&gt;))

The picture doesn't hang above a fireplace, it hangs at Althorp House in
the 115ft Picture Gallery, which is hung with a succession of portraits
culminating in Van Dyck's masterpiece, War and Peace, situated on the far
end wall. The room was originally conceived for Elizabethan ladies to
take exercise in on wet days to prevent their long dresses from getting
dirty in the mud.

The first Earl, Henry Spencer, a firm Royalist, served as Charles I's
negotiator in the early years of the conflict with Parliament, a conflict
that evolved into the Civil Wars. In 1643, he was created Earl of
Sunderland. Three months later he was killed at the Battle of Newberry.
Anthony Van Dyck was, of course, the court painter of Charles I.

"/> Hi T.!
I believe what you are looking at (the doo-dad to the left that looks like a
ball on a pedestal) is a Fiesta Bulb candle holder. Seems logical that it
would be Fiesta, what with all that fiesta in the background.
BTW.....I know some fiesta collectors who would sell their birthright to get
their hands on all that stuff. Once, when I was a teenager, I was in a thrift
store with my mom and spotted a bunch of Fiesta. All the pieces were like 50
cents or a dollar and I told my mom I wanted to start collecting it. Mom said
&quot;Oh NO! That JUNK?! You don't want that ugly, heavy stuff!&quot; Well,
golly.....I did too! And I am still sorry I didn't buy it then. I could be
selling those one dollar plates for $20 a shot right now. Unless I was a
descendant of Andy Warhol, of course. Then I suppose each plate would go for
many times that.
As far as provenance...I agree...why should some famous person's ownership
make any item valuable if it does not have value as it stands on it's own?
(like that soda can that washed up on the beach that &quot;could&quot; have belonged to
JFK Jr.). When someone in the States asks for &quot;provenance&quot; I think what they
are really asking is this: Does it have history? Is it really an antique?
Can you tell me if it was made by an immigrant in Minnesota 200 years ago or
was it made three weeks ago by someone in Taiwan?
When we talk about provenance here we do not talk about famous
owners...(usually) but it is nice to be able to say that it was from an estate
in Pennsylvania, or given to some bankers wife when he returned from Europe in
1920 (because it was inscribed, or whatever). I once had an entire box of
linens that someone had carefully labeled. Each tablecloth had a note of what
event it had been used for! Example: Fred's 60th birthday party, Mabel's
daughter's baby shower, etc. Ok...so maybe it wasn't real provinence...but the
owner certainly attributed some kind of value or interest to the item based
upon these little tidbits of information.
Of course, all of this could just be a nice work of fiction. When they
ask you to start writing it down and putting your John Hancock on it...well
then you better have your &quot;Provenance&quot; Lawyer standing by. Heh, heh.
Talk to you soon!

You are right, Fayette. That's what it is.

Recently, so I hear, a distant, distant
relative of a relative of mine
died and left a house full
of Fiesta that went unrecognised by the
heirs.
Someone somewhere had a good month
on that stuff, I guess.

The difference is only that Fiesta represents an attainable touch of
style for we, the great unwashed! Utilitarian, yes.
Mass produced? Absolutely! Common? Certainly! Beautiful? No more or
less so than a Monet painting, in their own way IMO. As someone who
dines on these plates on a daily basis (with catalin flatware, of
course), I can only say that it adds to my enjoyment of life. Homer
Laughlin Co. hit on a pallette of colors that WORKS! The simple colors
come in a blend of options that pleases my eye and sensibilities. Why
do I need to defend this feeling to the likes of you, Mr. M? The value
has only been reassessed in the market of supply and demand, the same as
&quot;The Waterlillies&quot; - it's only a question of dollar amount. When one
equates &quot;merit&quot; with rarity, it all comes out as eliteism in my opinion!
If you want to talk about your Irish crystal or cased clocks or elf
ashtrays, Ronnie, have at it. I shant interrupt you. But I am sick to
death of your belittling of the simple joys and collecting pleasures of
the majority of the posters of this group under the guise of &quot;raising
their heads&quot; to your Elysian level and your (mis)interpretation of the
role of Rhadamanthus.

"/> Bob , for about the fifth time this week I sat down and wrote multiple
pages to respond to this issue of Collectibles vs Antiques only to
delete the whole works in frustration. In both camps the true collector
of either cares not a bit about value other than to get insurance, both
love what they collect and do so because something moves them about the
item in question. They collect it because they want to, not because it
is the hot item of the month,or Oprah and Martha tell them &quot; IT's a good
thing&quot;. It's this point where the problem sits, what is worthy of
discussion? something whose only merit is it's value as a commodity (
ready made collectibles) or things we find interesting because of their
beauty, age or unusual nature? In my opinion you can collect and discuss
anything you want, but let's face facts, a lot of the stuff we talk
about is crap, stuff our parents and grandparents threw out, whose value
and merit is being blown all out of proportion by demographics and
nothing more. No matter how many articles are written about it or how
much exposure it receives on TV it will always still be crap,
interesting, fun to talk about with other collectors, but still just old
crap. Am l looking down collectors of Fiesta or collectors of similar
items?, no, l collect crap myself , ( I'II bet Ronnie's got a collection
of pot lids);~)) but l'm not afraid to call it what it is, old crap.
It's only redeeming quality is nostalgia and the monetary value other
nostalgic people are willing to pay for the memory.

"/> Yes it certainly is Bob, I believe that is the object and the exercise of
this group, thanks for pointing that out. However, I was under the
impression we were already having a discussion until you popped your head
around the corner and turned it into a personal discussion on me, and how
I &quot;belittled&quot; the &quot;majority&quot; of the folk posting to this ng, and of
course, your health problems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Rarely do I discuss value here - most of my comments relate to dating

"/> Over the years I have shown a VAST range of stuff to this group, from
everyday objects, to pieces of period furniture, NOTHING is beneath me,
Bob. I have over the last 25+ years sold all manner of shite, that I
would imagine would even gob-smack YOU, Bob. I pride myself in instantly
recognizing shite, it's part and parcel of this trade, Bob.

I took the time, trouble and effort to further the on-going discussion on
provenance, which is what WE were originally discussing or pondering, if
YOU recall?. My effort was to look out some old Sotheby's catalogues and
previews and I picked on the Warhol sale, (I could have picked the Elton
John sale and illustrated some of that junk) I took the time and scanned
and image of everyday ware and commercial stock from that sale (namely
the coloured crockery and the contents of his kitchen) and at my own
expense loaded the image to the group. In the post that accompanied that
image my opening words were ..

&quot;For fun .. here's a picture from a Sotheby's estate sale ... &quot;

Seems to me, you took this to be a personal onslaught on you and the
things that YOU collect, I somehow feel you have missed the plot along
the way, Bob. You are not discussing ANYTHING Bob relating to the subject
at hand, but are away out on some holy crusade of your own. I would
suggest YOU re-read the whole of the on-going discussion and make an
effort to grasp what I am really saying and attempting to discuss. That
is, &quot;provenance&quot; or conceived provenance and how that in turn can affect
the antique and collecting markets on what was once merely regarded as
undistinguished everyday objects and how the big sales rooms can
manipulate the market for no-ones benefit, other than their own.

The question of VALUE seems to be more important to some in this ng than
the actual merit of the object itself. In my own personal field of
collecting, the VALUE is totally unimportant to me, and the object itself
must stand on its own two feet with its merits, and for whatever reason
those merits may be, if its purely a case that a former 50cent object
that was originally regarded as junk but is now &quot;worth&quot; 20bucks a go then
discuss away, and I &quot;shant&quot; interrupt YOU.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You wrote:
&gt;&quot;=85Let them eat .. cake?&quot; ... &quot;Qu'ils mangent de la brioche,&quot; I don't
&gt;mind you misquoting Marie Antoinette, however, I do object when you
&gt;misquote me and mix other quotes into mine. With a quote like the above,
&gt;it would seem to me you must get a kick from other people's suffering.&quot;
&gt;--------------------------
&gt;Who said I was quoting you?

"/> Huh?? .. You have lost it again, Bob. The &quot;Let them eat .. cake?&quot; is not
my quote, obviously, but a quote *attributed* to Marie Antoinette, it's
is also a misquote, Bob. But the point Bob, is at the end of your
previous post you misquoted me by mixing part of Fayette's previous post
with parts of my post, please pay attention, Bob.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Irish people.&quot; Now, I will freely admit that in some parts of Ireland
&quot;An Irish State for and Irish people&quot; will be regarded as &quot;rude&quot;
although, regarded as more offensive that rude, however, that section of
the Irish constituent is currently under review, or should I say, up for

Ronnie, Mike....

Ronnie - your stuff doesn't look like crap. Actually looks like some neat
porcelain. Unfortunately I am viewing from AOL's compressed webviewer and so I
can't tell too much...

Guys, there are plenty of things I consider crap - but its really not crap if
someone enjoys it. Because its not valuable doesn't make it crap.

There are plenty of high priced antiques &quot;I&quot; think are crap. Because its
expensive doesnt make me think its great.

Many antiques and collectible markets are created just from that memorible or
sentimental warm fuzzy feeling people get over stuff they remember from their
childhood. Once someone writes a book about it - it creates a following and
therefore it becomes valuable.

Ya know - back in the 1940-early 1960's - Tiffany (what I specialize in) was
considered crap. At the turn of the century Louis Comfort Tiffany was
considered one of the most desirable interior designers, church window
designer, lamp mfg, glass blower in America. The price people paid to have
something from Tiffany Studios was outrageous (and it still is) - however when
the Art Deco movement came about, Tiffanys works were thought to be rather
garrish and people began throwing them out (seriously) - many windows were
destroyed, lamps tossed out along with glass pieces etc. When found in
auctions, they would sell boxlots for maybe $30-40.

Lillian Nassau and a few friends decided back in the 1960's to create a market
for these wares. They would attend auctions where his merchandise would be
sold and bid against each other to give the appearance there was a desire for
Tiffany items again. It worked!

Today, prices are at an all time high. I pay up to 5 figures for some pieces
of glass and over 6 figures for some lamps. And you know what....some people
think what I buy and sell is pretty damn neat - and other people still think
its crap.

I guess I won't quote anyone....
But I'd like to say: I just LOVE it when the big boys fight! HA! Let
them eat Cake! 3D3D3D3D (what is all that 3D stuff anyway?)
And I thank T for the sporking. Made me laugh, it did.
And the jpeg of Ronnie's collections....what fun. A collection today -
Tomorrow squeezed into your bedroom like Andy Warhol. Beware! :-D
Now where was I....Oh yes. All this talk of junk and enjoyment and
collecting. Wanted to tell you what I did the other night. I had found an
aluminum table fountain at the flea market. Totally wacky. Totally tacky.
The worst of the worst. I bought it. I had also just ordered stainless
steel chopsticks from William Sonoma. HEY, I like them better than sporks!

So for dinner I served up grilled salmon, couscous (try eating that with
chopsticks!) and grilled vegetables....all on red and white striped fireking
dishes with the aluminum fountain in the middle. Life is an ADVENTURE!
Good thing I can sell all this stuff when I am done playing, huh?
Good luck and be merry!
Fayette
btw Floyd paid me a visit last night....had water up to the doorstep, over
the wheel wells on the cars....had the *tiny* car parked up on high ground so
it would not float away. Heard a loud crashing noise as a large branch fell
on the roof. Son #2 went wading up to his waist in the front yard. No
school today. Don't ya love it! Wish I had some fiestaware for the &quot;after
hurricane celebration&quot;.

And, an over-coloured framed print of a fairy, most likely an

Now this is the lowest I will go!!

"/> Hi Reyne, the crap l collect has little value( stereo scopes and cards),
l love the stuff, but it would still be crap if it were worth six
figures. I like it because the views are like little time capsules , I
find them interesting and that's why I collect them, what other people
feel about it matters not. It's the people that try to elevate these
mundane things, give them special status as works of art that's
laughable, not us humble sods that collect the stuff because we love the
'Crap';~))

&gt;Ya know - back in the 1940-early 1960's - Tiffany (what I specialize in) was

&gt;considered one of the most desirable interior designers, church window
&gt;designer, lamp mfg, glass blower in America. The price people paid to have
&gt;something from Tiffany Studios was outrageous (and it still is) - however when
&gt;the Art Deco movement came about, Tiffanys works were thought to be rather
&gt;garrish and people began throwing them out (seriously) - many windows were
&gt;destroyed, lamps tossed out along with glass pieces etc. When found in
&gt;auctions, they would sell boxlots for maybe $30-40.

"/> Exactly Reyne, and that is the point to my previous respond to you,
although I may have appeared rather cryptic. - Anyhow, it's not merely
YOUR opinion on Tiffany, it's the general universal opinion. That's what
is really important and what matters. Sure Tiffany was influenced by
others, both contemporary and what went before, but in turn, he had a
massive impart within his own time frame, remove him from that overall
time frame of the period and there would be an exceptionally large
missing piece of the jig-saw, a big empty hole. Removing him from the
time frame would have resulted in a different design of decorative
arts/studio glass movement, not only in America but in Europe as well.

It is the same, only to a bigger extent, in removing someone like William
Morris from the period, the whole of the 19thC and 20thC decorative
movement would have been totally different, perhaps even non-existent.
That to me, is the important thing, and the merits of these people, their
work, their designs, how they influenced further generations and even
their philosophy and ideals were immense.

The **monetary** value, worth, book price, market price, call it what you
wish, is TOTALLY irrelevant, be it 50 cents or 100000 bucks a go, it will
make no difference to the real merits these people left behind and how
they effected the history of design and influenced that design for others
that followed.

Now, can we say the same for J.&amp;G.Meakin flow blue china, Japanese willow
pattern, colourful utility crockery, 19thC bric-à-brac, nondescript
silver plate and all the other mountains of useless shite we discuss in
this ng? - take away *their* monetary value and the personal sentiment of
this nondescript carp and what is left? ... NOTHING IMO .... because
this sort of stuff and its like has no other merits whatsoever .. other
than &quot;how much is it worth .. today?&quot; and &quot;how much can I sell it for?&quot;

"/> Clever miss Charleen got it right off :) .. It's a sweetmeat fork or a
&quot;sucket fork&quot; for eating sweetmeats or sucket. I have no idea the date of
this one, probably 17thC yes. A two or three pronged fork at one end of
the handle and a spoon bowl, usually of teaspoon size, at the other.
Early inventories of c1550 mention these utensils, but most of the few
surviving English and American examples, which are usually made of
silver, date from the late 17th century.

Whilst we are NOW discussing forks you will enjoy these couple of quotes,
at least I hope you do, but you'll love the spelling that's for sure. :)

Early reference to a fork c1463, no exact source .... &quot;my silvir forke
for grene gynor&quot; ... 50 years later another was described as being used
for the same delicacy ... now what the hell is &quot;grene gynor?&quot; I have no
idea.

Another, this appears in Coryat's, Crudities, c1611, in which Thomas
Coryat tells of his five month of travelling on mainland Europe, he
wrote, ... &quot;I observed a custome in all those Italian Cities and Townes
through which I passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw
in my travels, neither doe I think that any other nation of Christendome
doth use it, but only Italy. The Italian, and most other strangers that
are cormorant in Italy, doe alwaies, at their meales, use a little forke
when they cut the meate&quot; he goes on to say, that the Italians dislike
meat on a dish being touched with the fingers .... &quot;seeing all men's
fingers are not alike cleane ...&quot;

And this one, a Joseph Brasbridge, who was a retail silversmith in Fleet
Street, London c1770, wrote about an invitation to dinner he received
from one of his clients, at a fashionable London hotel .. &quot;where the
cloth was laid with a profusion of plate&quot; but Brasbridge could not do
justice to the occasion. In his own words .... ' &quot; because&quot; said I,
taking up one of the silver forks, &quot;I know how to sell these articles,
but not how to use them&quot;. ' - he must have been a Yank, Eh? :)))

Your sweetmeat fork is interesting. Not enough detail in the photo,
though. I couldn't tell if that was a spoon or a bulb at the top.
How big is it? What's it made of? The tines look too blunt to stab
anything with, have they been dulled, or were you meant to scoop &amp;

I hear what you are saying and in part agree, however here is a side thought...

just my 2 cents

I have a kitchen full of depression glass. I am 31 yrs old, so far from it
being something of my childhood memories.

Is it valuable? Well...there is definitely a strong market for it, and alot of
people buy it because they like it, enjoy collecting it etc. There are
definitely those that buy it because they can make money selling it - but those
people dont' count. The people like myself that buy it really enjoy it.

Now...this was made during the depression era which I am sure I don't have to
explain to you. It is mass produced, machine made crap.

BUT! (there is a BUT) if you ask me....the mfg of glass from that time period
were often very creative in their exterior designs, colors manufactured and
shapes created. At the time much of this merchandise was sold in dime stores,
and or given away in soap boxes, at banks, movie theaters etc.

Now when you compare depression glass with the equivalent such as Corelle today
- seems to me like depression glass is far more artistically impressive, and
historically significant.

So does this qualify as crap? or not?

Many people think depression glass is cheap shit/junque if you will. But from
its qualifications, I would say its far from crap.

"/> Reyne, it may have some context from the USA viewpoint, but for the rest
of us, this side of the pond, it has no significance whatsoever, it is
merely, pressed glass from the 1930/40s, plus.

I have a friend that's a serious glass collector, but he would also buy
cheap pressed glass for everyday kitchen use, amongst his accumulation of
pressed glass he would have a number of US pieces, as well as, English
pieces of the same time frame. This is not a collection, he uses it and
sometimes he accidentally breaks it, and no tears are spilled, the stuff
is treated like any other kitchen utility ware, or for dishing up a salad
or serving deserts, sticking bunches of flowers into .. etc etc.

Anyways, to the point. I honestly see little difference between his US
examples and the English pieces, except, the US pieces would be a lot
more gaudy. I am sorry, but you wouldn't wish me to lie, just to win
friends and influence people. ;)

The English Victorian pressed glass is equally as gaudy, but over here,
pressed glass is cheap, no-one really wants it, and most times it's VERY
hard to sell, it really needs to be cheap in order to move it on. It's
the sort of stuff that the auction houses put into box lots and we pick
up at car boots sales, jumble sales and in the second-hand shops. Some of
this Vicky stuff dates from the mid-late 19thC, makes no difference how
old it is. The stuff has never been a good seller, we see it around the
antique fairs, week after week, month after month some times years, just
sitting on dealers stands collecting dust, why the hell they buy it in
the first place is a mystery to me. Good money down the pan.

Early, 3 or 4 parts mould pressed stuff is slightly different, it does
sell but only amongst knowledgable glass collectors, the general public
wouldn't know ass from elbow if presented with an 1830s press moulded
piece. It's also cheap compared with quality pieces of the same time
frame. There's some history behind the early pieces, but as I say no
significance with late Vicky stuff onwards, it was mass-produced in the
millions.

That's the story from over here, is it crap?? ... well IMO, from what I
have see of it, and the stuff on the web, and the stuff that is sometimes
posted in this ng ... YES .. it is crap, be it English, US or Timbuctoo,
pressed glass is pressed glass is pressed glass. :)

&gt;Exactly Reyne, and that is the point to my previous respond to you,
&gt;although I may have appeared rather cryptic. - Anyhow, it's not merely
&gt;YOUR opinion on Tiffany, it's the general universal opinion. That's what
&gt;is really important and what matters.
&gt;Sure Tiffany was influenced by
&gt;others, both contemporary and what went before, but in turn, he had a
&gt;massive impart within his own time frame, remove him from that overall
&gt;time frame of the period and there would be an exceptionally large
&gt;missing piece of the jig-saw, a big empty hole. Removing him from the
&gt;time frame would have resulted in a different design of decorative
&gt;arts/studio glass movement, not only in America but in Europe as well.

&gt;It is the same, only to a bigger extent, in removing someone like
&gt;William
&gt;Morris from the period, the whole of the 19thC and 20thC decorative
&gt;movement would have been totally different, perhaps even non-existent.
&gt;That to me, is the important thing, and the merits of these people, their
&gt;work, their designs, how they influenced further generations and even
&gt;their philosophy and ideals were immense.
&gt;The **monetary** value, worth, book price, market price, call it what you

&gt;make no difference to the real merits these people left behind and how
&gt;they effected the history of design and influenced that design for others

&gt;Now, can we say the same for J.&amp;G.Meakin flow blue china, Japanese willow

excellence...against all outside pressures....are often not successful at all.
And people who compromise their standards for the sake of &quot;how much can I sell

ideals.....selling to the highest bidder and adapting to the general masses
desires, but losing their souls in the process.
Going even further with Ayn we can see how the general public takes these
ideals of purity of design and thought and call them ugly. Anyone who dares
to maintain their views and not compromise and &quot;get along&quot; by doing so....is
considered anti-social.

Massive snippola of good stuff...

Dear diary, I nearly had a relapse today....woke up to find r.a.
actually DICUSSING antiques...!!

Basically the bottom line is that there are items that simply please
the eye and items that lift the soul and make a small mark in history.

Antiques, ***true antiques*** fall into the second category.

Unfortunately there is not much exposure to this category for most of
us and we have to deal with the former. After a while this causes
thoseof us lucky enough to be nearer good pieces in homes, museums and
fineantique shops, to draw a heavy sigh and wish for more discussion
of these items.

The final blow is when pure monetary value is added to the first
category as its major or even sole characteristic and some prat posts
a &quot;howmuch is this awful 1950's elf ashtray worth?&quot;

William Morris' family via Jane Burden (my wife was Elaine Burden)

Interesting. I'd love to see a book showing photos of English Depression Glass.

We have EAPG here from the 1830-50's and its a hard sell. There are some people
that collect it but not near the following as depression glass.

Depression glass here started in the late 19'teens till the 40's but I guess
that really isn't considered depression during the 40's

I use mine daily - eat off it, drink out of it, put flowers in it, just like
your friend. I don't cry when a piece breaks because I know I can find another
one. However, crap or not - its equivalent on being sold at the likes of Kmart
or Target and any other dime store of today is no where near as pleasing as
good ole DG

Good question

Actually, I believe it was the awards he won at the expositions that earned him
the original recognition he received (along with the help of his fathers money
to help him with his endeavors along the way)

The artifically created market didn't happen until much later.

&gt;Interesting. I'd love to see a book showing photos of English Depression Glass.

"/> Reyne, the term &quot;depression glass&quot; is not used over here, in fact, one
would be hard pressed (oops sorry) to find such a term in any English
reference book on the subject of glass. Whilst the book may well have a
section or a chapter or two on the subject of US glass, the term
depression glass is not really used.

My glass books, the ones which include a US glass section, would mainly
discuss 19thC American glass, American studio, and American decorative
art glassware, none that I have, would even mention, let alone discuss US
mass-produced pressed glass from the 1930s onwards.

Now perhaps, we are at cross purpose here, or I may well be
misinterpreting the term &quot;depression glass&quot; as used in the US., as
something else. As I understand it, depression glass is just machine made
mass-produced pressed glassware of utility standard, and made during the
Depression years (economical depression) in the USA so its term
&quot;depression&quot; for that reason??

Am I correct in my conclusion on the term &quot;depression glass&quot; or are we
discussing some unique US manufacturing process? As I am led to believe,
the process of making pressed glass during the 1930s onwards is the same
in the US as it is/was in England, therefore, it's nothing more than mere
machine &quot;Pressed glassware&quot; and as such, there really isn't that much to
separate the English version from the US examples, other than, an over
the top style in the US version and maybe less metal in the US stuff.

English pressed glassware would differ in its quality. Some pieces (most
pieces) would be very shoddy indeed, seams not polished out, poor
pressing, burr on the pressing and poor colour. Whereas other English
made pieces, by the better manufactures and marketed at a higher end
retail outlet, would attempt to imitate cut glass a lot more faithfully,
with polished out seams, no burrs, deep and sharper pressing, and much
better colour. I don't think, if you handled a piece of English pressed
glass of the 1930s time frame you would be all that impressed (oops
sorry) .. it's basically crap. :)

&gt;&gt;both daughters of the same family of Oxford blacksmiths and farriers!

&gt; For those with a real and genuine interest (other than mere value) in the
&gt; art and crafts movement of the 19thC here a great book, a masterpiece.

&gt; Be warned, this is NOT a price guide but a real book with historical
&gt; content, a massive read of nearly a 1000 pages, of text, references and
&gt; index, plus a wonderful photo section of Morris, his family and his
&gt; followers

&gt; .... Not for you GK, so save your money, there isn't a $$ sign in sight.

&gt; William Morris, by Fiona MacCarthy, Faber and Faber, ISBN 0-571-17495-7

&gt; Jon, here's a wee photo of some of your misses' relations and friends of
&gt; the Morris family, what a mob. :)

One little nitpick, belleek is spelled with 2 l's, not one. A common error,
according to ebay's listings. The dog on the jug and on belleek's mark is an

could be wrong. The local irish store has several tucked here and there for

I've also seen them at local fleamarkets &amp; antique malls, usually more then

Gary and Lois,

China like the ones you see on my website can still
be picked up pretty cheaply in Sweden. I have even
picked up a few pieces of chintz for pennies.
I think the Swedish taste prefers porcelain that
is a bit less decorative so there isn't always a
demand for this type of English porcelain here.

I have pieces from many different factories like
Myott, Mason, Adams, Staffordshire, etc.
But instead of collecting odd pieces that don't
always match each other I need to concentrate
on collecting a set of this kind of china.

I have some of the blue &amp; white stuff also.
Most of what I collect is blue, pinkish, &amp; brown.

Its nice to meet a fellow collector of this type
of china. Show me some of your collection when
you get a chance.

Regards,

Kat

"/> Kat, I wasn't going to get involved in this, however, what you show on
you page could by no stretch of the imagine be termed antique.

That said, the Masons is not true porcelain. The Wedgwood, looks like
earthenware to me.(??) - both pieces are of little age, nor would appeal
to a serious collector, certainly nothing to do with the Victorian era or
the 19thC ... &quot;Probably 20thC&quot; is bang on the mark

Ironstone was a type of stoneware introduced in England early in the 19th
century by Staffordshire potters who sought to develop a porcelain
substitute that could be mass-produced for the cheaper market. The result
of their experiments was a dense, hard, durable stoneware that came to be
known by several names - e.g., semiporcelain, opaque porcelain, English
porcelain, stone china, new stone - all of which were used to describe
essentially the same product. The first successful manufacture of
ironstone was achieved in 1800 by William Turner of the Lane End
potteries at Longton, Staffordshire. In 1805 Turner sold his patent to
Josiah Spode the Second, Stoke-on-Trent, who called his bluish gray wares
stone china and new stone. A patent was granted to Charles James Mason,
Lane Delph, in 1813 for the manufacture of &quot;English porcelain,&quot; a white
ware that he marketed as Mason's Ironstone China. Job and George Ridgway
also produced a similar product under the name stone china. The wares,
usually service pieces and vases based on Oriental shapes, were most
often decorated with painted Chinese and Japanese motifs, some of which
were executed by transfer printing. An ironstone china called graniteware
or white granite was a standard of American potteries from about 1860 to
1900.

Now maybe someone else with pop in and tell you all about &quot;Enoch
Wedgwood&quot; with the 'detergent and acid resisting colours.'

As to Tullamore Dew, it's a premium Irish whiskey - distilled, matured
and blended at the Midleton Distillery in County Cork, Ireland. The
origins can be traced back to 1829, when it was founded by Michael
Molloy. Tullamore Dew is currently sold in 40 countries. In Germany and
Denmark, it is the brand leader of the Irish whiskey category, whilst
across continental Europe, it holds the number two position. I believe it
is now being actively marketed in Ireland by Cantrell &amp; Cochrane, who
acquired the brand from Irish Distillers.

&quot;Oh, won't you help me, Sergeant. Get me out of this old jail.
I don't know how I got here. I was drunk on a swampy trail;
On Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew; drinkin' Tullamore Dew,
Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew; drinkin' Tullamore Dew.

I didn't mean to be drunk and bring ya all this shame,
But I had a fight with the Shore Patrol, down in old Blauvain,
Over Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew; drinkin' Tullamore Dew.

Now, this old jail has rats and fleas and snakes crawl on the floor.
Take me back to my swamp, Sarge and I won't get drunk no more,
On Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew; drinkin' Tullamore Dew.

There's Friendlies all around us and it's lookin' bad, I think.
We can't do a thing, Sarge, so let's have a little drink
Of Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew; drinkin' Tullamore Dew.&quot;

And finally, a link for you .....

Agreed. Remember what happened to the price of cookie jars after the auction

earth a little bit. Big mistake for people to see selling price of something
for someone famous and then assume that one they have just like it is worth the

&gt;For fun .. here's a picture from a Sotheby's estate sale, and you'll
&gt;agree, a load of old kitsch junk if ever there was, this was the part
&gt;contents of the kitchen. If it had been my junk or Jon's junk or even T's
&gt;junk, Sotherby's would probably have told our executors to piss off on
&gt;down the street to the local flea.

&gt;But oh no!! this junk was embraced by Sotheby's with all the hype they
&gt;could muster, with full coloured catalogue, TV and media press coverage
&gt;and in the end, silly ridiculous prices. Why? simply because of
&gt;provenance ... the former property and estate of Andy Warhol ... viewing
&gt;at the time: Frankfurt, 10th-12th March; Cologne, 15th-17th March;
&gt;London, 24th-28th March; and Tokyo, 31st March - 5th April with the sale
&gt;finally ending in New York between 23th April-3rd May.

&gt;Of course there were a few good things as well. :)))

Ronnie,

We were talking about junk. Right?

A direct quote from my page:

&quot;All of the above porcelain is probably of 20th century production.&quot;
8-p hehe!

I put the above statement on the page because of my lack
of information on this kind of china. I have info on
older marks from these factories but not 20th century
marks.

I know these items aren't truly antique. I thought
since the post was about junk then I could show some
of my 50 years or less items. Was I mistaken? I'm not
the only one who collects this type of porcelain and
from what I have heard they fetch good prices abroad
despite their lack of age. I think despite their age
they are beautiful and carry on the proud British
tradition of making incredible china and/or porcelain.

I thought the dew jug was interesting and I thank you
for giving me a bit of background information on it
and a nice limmerick. I also thank you for the
information on the porcelain since I have mainly
read about how to tell the difference between hard
and soft paste.

I have actually seen this Swedish band play Irish music.
They are not to bad.

Cheers,

Kathleen

&gt; Kat, I wasn't going to get involved in this, however, what you show on

&gt; Ironstone was a type of stoneware introduced in England early in the 19th
&gt; century by Staffordshire potters who sought to develop a porcelain
&gt; substitute that could be mass-produced for the cheaper market. The result
&gt; of their experiments was a dense, hard, durable stoneware that came to be
&gt; known by several names - e.g., semiporcelain, opaque porcelain, English
&gt; porcelain, stone china, new stone - all of which were used to describe
&gt; essentially the same product. The first successful manufacture of
&gt; ironstone was achieved in 1800 by William Turner of the Lane End
&gt; potteries at Longton, Staffordshire. In 1805 Turner sold his patent to
&gt; Josiah Spode the Second, Stoke-on-Trent, who called his bluish gray wares
&gt; stone china and new stone. A patent was granted to Charles James Mason,
&gt; Lane Delph, in 1813 for the manufacture of &quot;English porcelain,&quot; a white
&gt; ware that he marketed as Mason's Ironstone China. Job and George Ridgway
&gt; also produced a similar product under the name stone china. The wares,
&gt; usually service pieces and vases based on Oriental shapes, were most
&gt; often decorated with painted Chinese and Japanese motifs, some of which
&gt; were executed by transfer printing. An ironstone china called graniteware
&gt; or white granite was a standard of American potteries from about 1860 to
&gt; 1900.

&gt; Now maybe someone else with pop in and tell you all about &quot;Enoch
&gt; Wedgwood&quot; with the 'detergent and acid resisting colours.'

&gt; As to Tullamore Dew, it's a premium Irish whiskey - distilled, matured
&gt; and blended at the Midleton Distillery in County Cork, Ireland. The
&gt; origins can be traced back to 1829, when it was founded by Michael
&gt; Molloy. Tullamore Dew is currently sold in 40 countries. In Germany and
&gt; Denmark, it is the brand leader of the Irish whiskey category, whilst
&gt; across continental Europe, it holds the number two position. I believe it
&gt; is now being actively marketed in Ireland by Cantrell &amp; Cochrane, who
&gt; acquired the brand from Irish Distillers.

&gt;&quot;Oh, won't you help me, Sergeant. Get me out of this old jail.

"/> The missing puzzle piece falls into place.
I'll owe you a drink or two for that one, Ronnie.

If you recall my confusion about what constitutes
pearlware, creamware and ironstone; the place
where I was finally left was early Spode. No one
ever bothered to say, at least in the references I
checked, what the hell the stuff was made of.
They all just called it Spode, as if I was already
supposed to know what it was. So, it is just
stoneware like Mason's.

If you will further recall, I had posted a picture of
a handless cup that I called &quot;pearlware&quot;. It turns out
that that is a common misnomer that I had picked up
along the way. But it is just stoneware.

Many thanks,

&quot;Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o&quot;

Time to cut the crap, the jugs of whiskey, and the little folk.

For you Kat, and also for Ash, here is a page I put together of Irish
objects, made during the Irish Arts and Craft period in Ireland, c1880 -
c1930. I would point out, none of these pieces I own.

These pieces would represent only a very small fraction of what was going
on in Ireland within the aesthetic arts during this period, would also
have been known as the 'Irish Revival of Design and Handicraft' a phrase
coined at the time, which would have covered the full spectrum of art and
design, from fine art, to needlework and every other imaginable craft,
art and handicraft in between. Whilst the artists and movement were
directly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movements in England and
particularly that of William Morris, the Irish design and crafts work
draws directly on the Celtic arts, which also enjoyed a revival around
this time.

None of the pieces I have titled or written a description for, so if
anyone is really interested in knowing a little more, or in fact, the
purpose of some of the pieces, then feel free and post a question. This
may not be all that appealing to our American cousins but I believe it's
at least worth the look for interest sake, and there ISN'T a green
shamrock, leprechaun or bottle of Guinness in sight and certainly none of
that, diddley-dee music, which should be a relief for some. :&gt;)

The settle is nice but not my thing.

What is the pin, scarf clasp looking piece. I would guess it is neither
because it might be very painful to be wearing it on one's &quot;front&quot; and

Damn, was that YOU? Naw, that was some old broad.

But back when I was with headquarters for the Atlantic Submarine Force
at New London, Ct., the actress Betsy Palmer *did* actually get into
my pants.

She showed up to tour some of our boats, but she was wearing a skirt,
something that was thought ... um ... too unseamly. Up and down
ladders and all. :)

So off I went to my quarters, brought back a pair of jeans, and
Betsy's day was saved. Probably oughta wash those pants sometime.

Maureen Collins Ryan, 1909-1977 of Limerick, she worked in silver
jewellery, hand-wrought silver objects and enamels. Her jewellery fused
Celtic and Art Nouveau styles. This style of jewellery is heavily
reproduced today in Ireland, at the tacky end, made from cheap soft base
metals and set with Connemara marble or other cheap coloured stones and
sold in the tourist traps. But there is a higher end crafted work as
well, hand made piece of this style in silver made at small studios, a
different thing altogether, Of course, it's all based and influenced by
medieval and earlier Celtic jewellery. The turn of the century and 1920's
pieces are absolutely beautiful and stunning ... these can be very
expensive and hard to come by.

It's an enamel plaque in a copper frame, made by John Keating 1917, and
entitled the 'The Dance' ... The dimensions I don't know, but my
impression also was that this could be a fire-screen. I have come across
this style in fire screens before, not by Keating and not of this
quality.

Keating was also known as Seán Keating, he was from Dublin, but went on
to become a leading painter in oils rather than a craft-worker.

&gt;&gt;then bend over. :-)

&gt; It's a silver brooch with coloured stones c1930 by Maureen Collins, later
&gt; Maureen Collins Ryan, 1909-1977 of Limerick, she worked in silver
&gt; jewellery, hand-wrought silver objects and enamels. Her jewellery fused
&gt; Celtic and Art Nouveau styles. This style of jewellery is heavily
&gt; reproduced today in Ireland, at the tacky end, made from cheap soft base
&gt; metals and set with Connemara marble or other cheap coloured stones and
&gt; sold in the tourist traps. But there is a higher end crafted work as
&gt; well, hand made piece of this style in silver made at small studios, a
&gt; different thing altogether, Of course, it's all based and influenced by
&gt; medieval and earlier Celtic jewellery. The turn of the century and 1920's
&gt; pieces are absolutely beautiful and stunning ... these can be very
&gt; expensive and hard to come by.

Ronnie,
These are some of the most unique A&amp;C items I've ever seen. I also
thought the one was a firescreen. I'd love to see more from this period
sometime. I seldom use the word breathtaking, but some of these really
are. Thank you for sharing.

&gt;The missing puzzle piece falls into place.
&gt;I'll owe you a drink or two for that one, Ronnie.

&gt;If you recall my confusion about what constitutes
&gt;pearlware, creamware and ironstone; the place
&gt;where I was finally left was early Spode. No one
&gt;ever bothered to say, at least in the references I
&gt;checked, what the hell the stuff was made of.
&gt;They all just called it Spode, as if I was already
&gt;supposed to know what it was. So, it is just
&gt;stoneware like Mason's.

&gt;If you will further recall, I had posted a picture of
&gt;a handless cup that I called &quot;pearlware&quot;. It turns out
&gt;that that is a common misnomer that I had picked up
&gt;along the way. But it is just stoneware.

"/> Hey T, at the fear of missing out on a drink or two, I have to say you
*may be* jumping the gun here.

First Spode .... Spode porcelain was introduced about 1800 in the factory
of Josiah Spode and Josiah Spode II at Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. It
was a hybrid porcelain, combining the ingredients of hard-paste porcelain
(china clay and china stone) and bone ash and became the standard English
bone china.

Now, Bone china ... The basic formula of six parts bone ash, four parts
china stone, and three and a half parts china clay remains the standard
English body. Hard porcelain is strong but chips fairly easily and,
unless specially treated, is usually tinged with blue or gray. Somewhat
easier to manufacture, bone china is strong, does not chip easily, and
has an ivory-white appearance.

Shortly after its introduction, the formula for bone china was being
utilized by Spode's competitors - Minton, Coalport, Davenport, Derby,
Worcester, and the Herculaneum factory at Liverpool. Later entrants in
the field were New Hall in 1810, Wedgwood in 1812, and Rockingham in
1820, quality, as much as form and decoration, varied from factory to
factory.

And then, there's stoneware ... which is a pottery that has been fired at
a high temperature (about 1,200 C) until vitrified (that is, glasslike
and impervious to liquid). Although usually opaque, some stoneware is so
thinly potted that it is somewhat translucent. Because stoneware is
nonporous, it does not require a glaze. When a glaze is used, it serves a
purely decorative function. There are three main kinds of glaze: lead
glaze, salt glaze, and feldspathic glaze (the same material used in the
body and glaze of porcelain). Stoneware originated in China as early as
1400 BC (Shang dynasty). In Europe, at Meissen in Saxony, developed a red
stoneware (in fact, varying from red to dark brown) in about 1707.
Because of the vogue for porcelain, stoneware manufacture declined in
Germany in the 18th century and was finally abandoned about 1730.

In 17thC England attempts were made to imitate both Meissen red stoneware
and I-hsing ware, for example, by John Dwight at Fulham and by John
Philip and David Elers at a factory in Staffordshire. About 1690 these
wares were largely replaced in England by salt-glazed stoneware, though
as late as the 18thC a red stoneware was produced by Josiah Wedgwood, who
called it rosso antico.

In 18thC England, salt-glazed stoneware was superseded by lead-glazed
earthenware, or creamware, by porcelain, and by Wedgwood's unglazed
stonewares (the black basaltes and white jaspers). In the early 19th
century it was superseded in the Rhineland by porcelain. In the 20thC
stoneware has been used by artist-potters such as Bernard Leach of
England and his followers.

I have said this before, T ... the cream colour of &quot;creamware&quot; was
considered a fault at the time, so Wedgwood introduced a white to bluish
white product called ***pearl ware*** in 1779. It was produced for nearly
a century. Creamware, however, continued to be made throughout the 19th
century and later.

Hey T, this bloody &quot;pearl ware&quot; is going to be the death of you man. :)

Make mine a dark rum and top it up with coke ... oops! sorry, Coca-Cola.

It was made by Margaret O'Keefe she showed it at the Arts and Crafts
Society of Ireland in 1917, the piece is called 'Spring' and it's an
enamelled plaque in a copper frame, appears to have been inspired by
paintings of the early Italian Renaissance. O'Keefe who was originally
from Wexford and closely associated with the Cluna Studio in Dublin. She
studied and trained at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin where she
excelled at enamelling. The Cluna Studio, also had other artists at work
and the studio turned out hand-made jewellery, fabrics, hand-coloured
prints, hand-paint woodwork, most all the work decorated in Celtic style.

Just in case anyone actually reads this stuff, I have requoted Ronnie's
post. I posted in reply that I was glad to find out what
early Spode was but instead of calling it &quot;ironstone&quot;, as I
should have, I got mixed up called it &quot;stoneware&quot; instead,
which led Ronnie to kindly post again, on the subject of stoneware.
Oy vey!

Thanks for both posts Ronnie and sorry everyone for
mucking this up.

&gt;&gt; Ironstone was a type of stoneware introduced in England early in the 19th
&gt;&gt; century by Staffordshire potters who sought to develop a porcelain
&gt;&gt; substitute that could be mass-produced for the cheaper market. The result
&gt;&gt; of their experiments was a dense, hard, durable stoneware that came to be
&gt;&gt; known by several names - e.g., semiporcelain, opaque porcelain, English
&gt;&gt; porcelain, stone china, new stone - all of which were used to describe
&gt;&gt; essentially the same product. The first successful manufacture of
&gt;&gt; ironstone was achieved in 1800 by William Turner of the Lane End
&gt;&gt; potteries at Longton, Staffordshire. In 1805 Turner sold his patent to
&gt;&gt; Josiah Spode the Second, Stoke-on-Trent, who called his bluish gray wares
&gt;&gt; stone china and new stone. A patent was granted to Charles James Mason,
&gt;&gt; Lane Delph, in 1813 for the manufacture of &quot;English porcelain,&quot; a white
&gt;&gt; ware that he marketed as Mason's Ironstone China. Job and George Ridgway
&gt;&gt; also produced a similar product under the name stone china. The wares,
&gt;&gt; usually service pieces and vases based on Oriental shapes, were most
&gt;&gt; often decorated with painted Chinese and Japanese motifs, some of which
&gt;&gt; were executed by transfer printing. An ironstone china called graniteware
&gt;&gt; or white granite was a standard of American potteries from about 1860 to
&gt;&gt; 1900.

Ronnie,

Thank you for showing this its very interesting to
see the Irish contribution to the Arts and Crafts
movement. My favorite pieces where the bowl and
high backed bench. Was the bench carved then painted
or just painted? The paint seems to have a bit of
dimension to it.

The metal work in the chest and pin look quite
intricate. How did they achieve such detail? And
the swans on the side of the box is an incredible
detail. Are these items made of silver? plated?

I have always admired celtic scrollwork.

I noticed some shamrocks on the sail of the boat
on the card at the bottom. )8-)

Regards,

Kat

&gt; /////////////////

&gt;&quot;Whack for my daddy-o
&gt; There's whiskey in the jar-o&quot;

&gt; Time to cut the crap, the jugs of whiskey, and the little folk.

&gt; For you Kat, and also for Ash, here is a page I put together of Irish
&gt; objects, made during the Irish Arts and Craft period in Ireland, c1880 -
&gt; c1930. I would point out, none of these pieces I own.

&gt; These pieces would represent only a very small fraction of what was going
&gt; on in Ireland within the aesthetic arts during this period, would also
&gt; have been known as the 'Irish Revival of Design and Handicraft' a phrase
&gt; coined at the time, which would have covered the full spectrum of art and
&gt; design, from fine art, to needlework and every other imaginable craft,
&gt; art and handicraft in between. Whilst the artists and movement were
&gt; directly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movements in England and
&gt; particularly that of William Morris, the Irish design and crafts work
&gt; draws directly on the Celtic arts, which also enjoyed a revival around
&gt; this time.

&gt; None of the pieces I have titled or written a description for, so if
&gt; anyone is really interested in knowing a little more, or in fact, the
&gt; purpose of some of the pieces, then feel free and post a question. This
&gt; may not be all that appealing to our American cousins but I believe it's
&gt; at least worth the look for interest sake, and there ISN'T a green
&gt; shamrock, leprechaun or bottle of Guinness in sight and certainly none of
&gt; that, diddley-dee music, which should be a relief for some. :&gt;)

"/> The bench is poker-work. A technique of burning designs on white wood
etc. with a heated metal rod, then it could be stained and polished or
parts of the design could be dyed with colour pigments. Was very popular
in Ireland, as it was in England. I believe poker-work kits can still be
obtained today.

"/> The metal casket with the bird supports was the work of James Archer
carried out at the Cork School of Art, c1910-20. It's a combination of
engraved steel borders, repoussé copper panels and cast brass elements,
and set with enamel roundels depicting Irish mythological figures. Archer
was also a teacher at the Cork School of Art, in metal-work and
enamelling.

The other casket, sitting on top of the wooden plinth, was the work of
Mia Cranwill, she was born in Dublin and dubbed by George Bernard Shaw as
'the Irish Benvenuto Cellini' - Mia Cranwill studied goldsmiths' and
silversmiths' at Manchester School of Art, after c1917 she set up her own
jewellery and metal-work studio in Dublin.

The casket was made and completed by her, in 1924. It was commissioned
for presentation to the Irish Free State Senate and was intended as a
receptacle for a vellum roll inscribed with the signatures of all the
members of that first Senate.

The main body of the shrine-like metal casket was made of Norwegian
copper, overlaid with pierced and repoussé silver panels with top panels
of filigree silver and gold, ornamented with four large conical panels in
blue, vermilion and black colour cloisonné enamel. Cones of similar type
appear on the handles and on the ridge, and the same shape was repeated
in the metal rivets. The four feet were fashioned in the form of rings
which turn down and lock into an upright position so that the casket
could be carried ceremonially on poles in the manner of early shrines,
otherwise, they rested flat on a plain stand made of Irish yew. The
designs at the front embodies heraldic devices, the crane to the right is
the artist's emblem which incorporated her monogram. She continued to
work until the 1950s ... she died in 1972.

Yes, a lot of what I have isn't old, in the antique sense of the
word.....but I love it. Something about the colors of the old glazes is
restful to the eyes, (heart, spirit?) and I find if I've had a stressful
day, (wait a minute....I'm a merchant selling giftware to an undeserving
public.....hell, ALL my days are stressful!!) I can just look upon my
collection and I feel better. As soon as I get to it, I'll drop a couple of
pictures to you. I only collect B &amp; W, tho....don't care for any of the reds
or browns. Did see a lavender set of Clarice Cliff, Tonquin, one time that I
really liked, but not enough to buy it instead of the blue.

&gt; Gary and Lois,

&gt; China like the ones you see on my website can still
&gt; be picked up pretty cheaply in Sweden. I have even
&gt; picked up a few pieces of chintz for pennies.
&gt; I think the Swedish taste prefers porcelain that
&gt; is a bit less decorative so there isn't always a
&gt; demand for this type of English porcelain here.

&gt; I have pieces from many different factories like
&gt; Myott, Mason, Adams, Staffordshire, etc.
&gt; But instead of collecting odd pieces that don't
&gt; always match each other I need to concentrate
&gt; on collecting a set of this kind of china.

&gt; I have some of the blue &amp; white stuff also.
&gt; Most of what I collect is blue, pinkish, &amp; brown.

&gt; Its nice to meet a fellow collector of this type
&gt; of china. Show me some of your collection when
&gt; you get a chance.

&gt; Regards,

&gt; Kat

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ronnie,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here are a few pieces of English porcelain I have
&gt;&gt;&gt; picked up and typically collect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also a jug of the ole UISGE BAUGH Irish whiskey we
&gt;&gt;&gt; were talking about once.

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://victorian.fortunecity.com/crescent/102/recantiques2.html

&gt;&gt;&gt; I bought the thing because I like collecting Irish
&gt;&gt;&gt; porcelain/pottery with shamrocks on them and I liked
&gt;&gt;&gt; the phrase &quot;give every man his dew&quot; Tullamore Dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I paid about the equivelant of $1.50 for the jug. WOW!
&gt;&gt;&gt; That really set me back quite a bit! hehe.... I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have paid much more if the whiskey was still in it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Kathleen

&gt;&gt;The missing puzzle piece falls into place.
&gt;&gt;I'll owe you a drink or two for that one, Ronnie.

&gt;&gt;If you recall my confusion about what constitutes
&gt;&gt;pearlware, creamware and ironstone; the place
&gt;&gt;where I was finally left was early Spode. No one
&gt;&gt;ever bothered to say, at least in the references I
&gt;&gt;checked, what the hell the stuff was made of.
&gt;&gt;They all just called it Spode, as if I was already
&gt;&gt;supposed to know what it was. So, it is just
&gt;&gt;stoneware like Mason's.

&gt;&gt;If you will further recall, I had posted a picture of
&gt;&gt;a handless cup that I called &quot;pearlware&quot;. It turns out
&gt;&gt;that that is a common misnomer that I had picked up
&gt;&gt;along the way. But it is just stoneware.

&gt; Hey T, at the fear of missing out on a drink or two, I have to say you
&gt; *may be* jumping the gun here.

&gt; First Spode .... Spode porcelain was introduced about 1800 in the factory
&gt; of Josiah Spode and Josiah Spode II at Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. It
&gt; was a hybrid porcelain, combining the ingredients of hard-paste porcelain
&gt; (china clay and china stone) and bone ash and became the standard English
&gt; bone china.

&gt; Now, Bone china ... The basic formula of six parts bone ash, four parts
&gt; china stone, and three and a half parts china clay remains the standard
&gt; English body. Hard porcelain is strong but chips fairly easily and,
&gt; unless specially treated, is usually tinged with blue or gray. Somewhat
&gt; easier to manufacture, bone china is strong, does not chip easily, and
&gt; has an ivory-white appearance.

&gt; Shortly after its introduction, the formula for bone china was being
&gt; utilized by Spode's competitors - Minton, Coalport, Davenport, Derby,
&gt; Worcester, and the Herculaneum factory at Liverpool. Later entrants in
&gt; the field were New Hall in 1810, Wedgwood in 1812, and Rockingham in
&gt; 1820, quality, as much as form and decoration, varied from factory to
&gt; factory.

&gt; And then, there's stoneware ... which is a pottery that has been fired at
&gt; a high temperature (about 1,200 C) until vitrified (that is, glasslike
&gt; and impervious to liquid). Although usually opaque, some stoneware is so
&gt; thinly potted that it is somewhat translucent. Because stoneware is
&gt; nonporous, it does not require a glaze. When a glaze is used, it serves a
&gt; purely decorative function. There are three main kinds of glaze: lead
&gt; glaze, salt glaze, and feldspathic glaze (the same material used in the
&gt; body and glaze of porcelain). Stoneware originated in China as early as
&gt; 1400 BC (Shang dynasty). In Europe, at Meissen in Saxony, developed a red
&gt; stoneware (in fact, varying from red to dark brown) in about 1707.
&gt; Because of the vogue for porcelain, stoneware manufacture declined in
&gt; Germany in the 18th century and was finally abandoned about 1730.

&gt; In 17thC England attempts were made to imitate both Meissen red stoneware
&gt; and I-hsing ware, for example, by John Dwight at Fulham and by John
&gt; Philip and David Elers at a factory in Staffordshire. About 1690 these
&gt; wares were largely replaced in England by salt-glazed stoneware, though
&gt; as late as the 18thC a red stoneware was produced by Josiah Wedgwood, who
&gt; called it rosso antico.

&gt; In 18thC England, salt-glazed stoneware was superseded by lead-glazed
&gt; earthenware, or creamware, by porcelain, and by Wedgwood's unglazed
&gt; stonewares (the black basaltes and white jaspers). In the early 19th
&gt; century it was superseded in the Rhineland by porcelain. In the 20thC
&gt; stoneware has been used by artist-potters such as Bernard Leach of
&gt; England and his followers.

&gt; I have said this before, T ... the cream colour of &quot;creamware&quot; was
&gt; considered a fault at the time, so Wedgwood introduced a white to bluish
&gt; white product called ***pearl ware*** in 1779. It was produced for nearly
&gt; a century. Creamware, however, continued to be made throughout the 19th
&gt; century and later.

&gt; Hey T, this bloody &quot;pearl ware&quot; is going to be the death of you man. :)

&gt; Make mine a dark rum and top it up with coke ... oops! sorry, Coca-Cola.

You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and

deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You

I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard
stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way
beyond the
stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are
trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far
that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no

Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe
can
really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from
the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so
uncontaminated
by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm
sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this,
you
may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength
left to
deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about
unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped
away
most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything.
Your
attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really,
stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was
hardly
effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read,
write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are
rudimentary
skills that many of us &quot;normal&quot; people take for granted that everyone
has an
easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are
&quot;challenged&quot;
persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had
known,
that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just
wouldn't have been &quot;right&quot;. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I

stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are
trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far
that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no
intellect
can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury
stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a
year.
Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe
can
really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from
the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so
uncontaminated
by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm
sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this,
you
may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength
left to
deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about
unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped
away
most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything.
Your
attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really,
stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was
hardly
effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read,
write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are
rudimentary
skills that many of us &quot;normal&quot; people take for granted that everyone
has an
easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are
&quot;challenged&quot;
persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had
known,
that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just
wouldn't have been &quot;right&quot;. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I
wish
you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem
to be
placing such a demand on you.

I'll have a look for that.

I own a pair of Art Nouveau wall plaques with the half clad ladies &lt;the
hussies&gt; a book cover box, maybe for Sunday church and a small expanding
book trough all in poker work. That's all at the moment ... sadly. But
over the years, stools/benches, wall hanging cabinets, stationary boxes,
frames single ones or the double and triples, furniture with poker work
panel and loads of other stuff. It has all gone up in price terribly over
the years, especially good Art Nouveau, it's a pity because it's nice
stuff and getting spoilt by over pricing.

So if I have a butcher block that was used in a butcher shop in London
in the 1500's, having the provenance to prove that makes no difference?

Obviously some things are immediately of importance. But aren't there
some things which are important basically because of their age? A 50
year old Amish bench is no big deal today, but if I have a photo of the
bench and maker, won't that be helpful 200 years from now? (Assuming my
grandchildren don't throw everything out with the trash). Isn't now
the best time to start establishing provenance, just in case?

&gt;&gt;&gt;We've been here before but 'provenance' (in Europe anyway) is only

&gt;&gt;&gt;knickers asseen by Prince Albert on their wedding night (or the
&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt;cabinet designed by Chippendale etc)....otherwise you are just
&gt; talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;about 'proof of ownership' or 'past history'....completely
&gt; different
&gt;&gt;&gt;from provenance and of no great affect to the value!!!

&gt;&gt;Jon -
&gt;&gt; My Beenie baby with the MINT tush tag and the original sales
&gt;&gt;slip has as much provenance as Vicky's knickers.

&gt;&gt;&quot;provenance&quot; ... according to the Oxford English Dictionary,
&gt;&gt;merely means &quot;the fact of coming from some particular source or
&gt;&gt;quarter&quot;. The definition says nothing about getting an owner's
&gt;&gt;pedigree, family arms, or appraising the value of a piece before
&gt;&gt;&quot;past history&quot; can be considered &quot;provenance&quot;.

&gt;&gt;Tsu Dho Nimh

&gt; I do know what its general definition is, but it is a technical term
&gt; in antiques and auction houses, at least here in the UK, and is used
&gt; to denote proof of importance of ownership or craftsman.

&gt; If you see the UK Antiques Roadshow they ask if the owner of an
&gt; ordinary piece has any &quot;history&quot; of the item. If the person is
&gt; claiming they have a piece of Napolean's hair taken from his deathbed
&gt; placed in a gold locket and given to a faithful servant...they then
&gt; start talking about 'provenance'.

&gt; Your BB definately does NOT have provenance in this manner,unless your
&gt; cryptic name is hiding a very famous one !!!!
