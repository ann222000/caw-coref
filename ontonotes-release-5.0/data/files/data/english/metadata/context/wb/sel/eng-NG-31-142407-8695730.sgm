(sorry but don't have time to email all posts) “The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists”. J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover, FBI Director 1924-1972, quoted in The Elks Magazine (August 1956).

“America’s top military leaders drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in US cities to trick the public into supporting a war against Cuba in the early 1960s. Approved in writing by the Pentagon Joint Chiefs, Operation Northwoods even proposed blowing up a US ship and hijacking planes as a false pretext for war.” [ &lt; http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662&amp;page;=1 &gt; ABC News, 5/1/01,  &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods &gt; Pentagon Documents]

March 2001: Taliban envoy Rahmatullah Hashimi meets with reporters, middle-ranking State Department bureaucrats and private Afghanistan experts in Washington. He discusses turning bin Laden over, but the US wants to be handed bin Laden directly, and the Taliban want to turn him over to some third country. About 20 more meetings on giving up bin Laden take place up till 9/11, all fruitless. [Washington &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/wpost102901.html &gt;  Post, 10/29/01] Hashimi also proposes that the Taliban would hold bin Laden in one location long enough for the US to locate and destroy him. However, this offer is refused. This is according to Laila Helms, daughter of former CIA director Richard Helms, who is doing public relations for the Taliban at the time [Village Voice, &lt; http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0124/ridgeway.php &gt;  6/6/01]

Spring 2001: The Sydney Morning Herald later reports, &quot;The months preceding September 11 [see] a shifting of the US military's focus. Over several months beginning in April [2001] a series of military and governmental policy documents [are] released that [seek] to legitimize the use of US military force in the pursuit of oil and gas.&quot; An article in the Army War College's journal by a former staff member of the Senate armed services committee argues for the legitimacy of &quot;shooting in the Persian Gulf on behalf of lower gas prices.&quot; He also &quot;advocate[s] the acceptability of presidential subterfuge in the promotion of a conflict&quot; and &quot;explicitly urge[s] painting over the US's actual reasons for warfare as a necessity for mobilising public support for a conflict.&quot; In April, the commander of US forces in the Persian Gulf/South Asia area, testifies to Congress that his command's key mission is &quot;access to [the region's] energy resources.&quot; The next month US Central Command begins planning for war with Afghanistan, plans that are later used in the real war. [Sydney &lt; http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511092926.html &gt;  Morning Herald, 12/26/02]

April 2001: A report commissioned by former US Secretary of State James Baker and the Council on Foreign Relations warns that the US is running out of oil, with a painful end to cheap fuel already in sight. It argues that &quot;the United States remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma,&quot; and that one of the &quot;consequences&quot; of this is a &quot;need for military intervention&quot; to secure its oil supply. It argues that Iraq needs to be overthrown so the US can control its oil.

April 23, 2001: A Global Hawk plane flies 22 hours from the US to Australia without pilot or passengers. A Global Hawk manager says, &quot;The aircraft essentially flies itself, right from takeoff, right through to landing, and even taxiing off the runway&quot;. [ITN, &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/itn042401.html &gt;  4/24/01] [this is the aircraft that crashed into the Pentagon, i.e. the passenger jet was a decoy]

May 2001 (B): Secretary of State Powell gives $43 million in aid to Afghanistan's Taliban government, purportedly to assist hungry farmers who are starving since the destruction of their opium crop in January on orders of the Taliban. [Los &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010522latimeslead &gt;  Angeles Times, 5/22/01] This follows $113 million given by the US in 2000 for humanitarian aid. [State Department Fact Sheet, &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/011211statedept &gt;  12/11/01]

May-August 2001: A number of the alleged hijackers make at least six trips to Las Vegas. At least Atta, Alshehhi, Nawaf Alhazmi, Ziad Jarrah, Khalid Almihdhar and Hani Hanjour were involved. These &quot;fundamentalist&quot; Muslims drink alcohol, have girlfriends, gamble, and frequent strip clubs. They even have strippers perform lap dances for them.

June 2001 (B): A 60-page internal memo on the Israeli &quot;art student&quot; spy ring is prepared by the DEA's Office of Security Programs. [Read the memo here: DEA &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/dea0601.html &gt;  report, 6/01] The memo is a compilation of dozens of field reports, and was meant only for the eyes of senior officials at the Justice Department, but it is leaked to the press around December 2001. The report connects the spies to efforts to foil investigations into Israeli organized crime activity involving the importation of the drug Ecstasy. The spies also appear to be snooping on top-secret military bases. For instance, on April 30, 2001, an Air Force alert was issued from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City concerning &quot;possible intelligence collection being conducted by Israeli art students.&quot; By the time of the report, the US has &quot;apprehended or expelled close to 120 Israeli nationals,&quot; but many remain at large. [Le &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/lemonde030502.html &gt;  Monde, 3/5/02, Salon, 5/7/02 &lt; http://real-info.1accesshost.com/artstudents.html &gt; ]

June 1-2, 2001: A multi-agency planning exercise sponsored by NORAD (the North American Aerospace Defense Command, in charge of defending US airspace) involves the hypothetical scenario of a cruise missile launched from a barge off the East Coast. Bin Laden is pictured on the cover of the proposal for the exercise. [American &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/afps060402.html &gt;  Forces Press Service, 6/4/02] After 9/11, the government claims that this type of an attack was completely unexpected, and as a result it had only 14 fighters on standby to defend the entire US. [Newsday, &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010923newsday &gt;  9/23/01]

June 9, 2001: Robert Wright, an FBI agent who spent ten years investigating terrorist funding, writes a memo that slams the FBI. He claims the &quot;FBI was merely gathering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred&quot; rather than actually trying to stop the attacks. [UPI, &lt; http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/30052002-054621-5800r.htm &gt;  5/30/02] Wright's shocking allegations are largely ignored when they first become public a year later. He is asked on CNN's Crossfire, one of the few outlets to cover the story at all, &quot;Mr. Wright, your charges against the FBI are really more disturbing, more serious, than [Coleen] Rowley's (see August 28, &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/9-11timeline60pg#rowley#rowley &gt;  2001). Why is it, do you think, that you have been ignored by the media, ignored by the congressional committees, and no attention has been paid to your allegations?&quot; The Village Voice says the problem is partly because he went to the FBI and asked permission to speak publicly instead of going straight to the media as Rowley did. The FBI put severe limits on what details Wright can divulge. He is now suing them. [Village Voice, 6/19/02 &lt; http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0225/gray.php &gt; ]

June 28, 2001: CIA Director George J. Tenet has been &quot;nearly frantic&quot; with concern. A written intelligence summary for national security adviser Condoleezza Rice says: &quot;It is highly likely that a significant al Qaeda attack is in the near future, within several weeks.&quot; Rice will later claim that everyone was taken by complete surprise by the 9/11 attack. By late summer, one senior political appointee says, Tenet had repeated this threat &quot;so often that people got tired of hearing it.&quot; [Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A30176-2002May16 &gt;  Post, 5/17/02]

Late June 2001: White House National Coordinator for Counter-terrorism, Richard Clarke, gives a direct warning to the FAA to increase security measures in light of an impending terrorist attack. The FAA refuses to take such measures. [New Yorker, &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity &gt;  1/14/02]

July 12, 2001: While in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to receive lifesaving medical treatment, Bin Laden supposedly meets with CIA agent Larry Mitchell in the Dubai hospital on this day, and possibly others. Mitchell reportedly lives in Dubai as an Arab specialist under the cover of being a consular agent. The CIA, the Dubai hospital and even bin Laden deny the story. Le Figaro and Radio France International stand by it. [Le &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/lefigaro103101.html &gt;  Figaro, 10/31/01, Radio France &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/rfi110101.html &gt;  International, 11/1/01, Reuters, &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/reuters111001.html &gt;  11/10/01] The Guardian claims that the two news organizations that broke the story, Le Figaro and Radio France International, got their information from French intelligence, &quot;which is keen to reveal the ambiguous role of the CIA, and to restrain Washington from extending the war to Iraq and elsewhere.&quot; The Guardian adds that during his stay bin Laden is also visited by a second CIA officer. [Guardian, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,584444,00.html &gt;  11/1/01]

Mid-July 2001:  John O'Neill, FBI counter-terrorism expert, privately discusses White House obstruction in his bin Laden investigation. O'Neill says: &quot;The main obstacles to investigate Islamic terrorism were US oil corporate interests and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.&quot;  He adds: &quot;All the answers, everything needed to dismantle Osama bin Laden's organization, can be found in Saudi Arabia.&quot; [CNN, 1/8/02 &lt; http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/08/ltm.05.html &gt; , CNN, &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/cnn010902.html &gt;  1/9/02, Irish &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/irishtimes111901.html &gt;  Times, 11/19/01,  &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/nodate/forbiddentruth.html &gt; Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth, released 11/11/01 (the link is an excerpt containing Chapter 1)]

July 21 2001: Alex Jones announces on his TV program that people must call their congressmen to stop a disaster which his contacts in the CIA and FBI tell him that they are not allowed to talk about and stop. http://www.inforwars.com &lt; http://www.inforwars.com/ &gt;

July 21, 2001: Three American officials, including a former US Ambassador to Pakistan meet with Pakistani and Russian intelligence officers in a Berlin hotel. [Salon, &lt; http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2002/08/15/forbidden_truth/index_np... &gt;  8/16/02, Guardian, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,556254,00.html &gt;  9/22/01] At the meeting, a former US State Department official passes on a message from Bush officials. He later says, &quot;I think there was some discussion of the fact that the United States was so disgusted with the Taliban that they might be considering some military action.&quot; [Guardian, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4264545,00.html &gt;  9/26/01] Accounts vary, but former Pakistani Foreign Secretary Niaz Naik later says he is told by senior American officials at the meeting that military action to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan is planned to &quot;take place before the snows started falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of October at the latest.&quot; The goal is to kill or capture both bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Omar, topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government of moderate Afghans in its place. Uzbekistan and Russia would also participate. Naik also says &quot;it was doubtful that Washington would drop its plan, even if bin Laden were to be surrendered immediately by the Taliban.&quot; [BBC, 9/18/01 &lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1550366.stm &gt; ]

July 24, 2001: Larry Silverstein's $3.2 billion lease of the WTC is finalized.

July 26, 2001: CBS News reports that Attorney General Ashcroft has stopped flying commercial airlines due to a threat assessment, but &quot;neither the FBI nor the Justice Department ... would identify [to CBS] what the threat was, when it was detected or who made it.&quot; [CBS, &lt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/07/26/national/main303601.shtml &gt;  7/26/01] “Ashcroft demonstrated an amazing lack of curiosity when asked if he knew anything about the threat. 'Frankly, I don't,' he told reporters.&quot; [San &lt; http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/06/... &gt;  Francisco Chronicle, 6/3/02] It is later reported that he stopped flying in July based on threat assessments made on May 8 and June 19. In May 2002, it’s claimed the threat assessment had nothing to do with al-Qaeda, but Ashcroft walked out of his office rather than answer questions about it. [AP, 5/16/02 &lt; http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,52982,00.html &gt; ] The San Francisco Chronicle concludes, &quot;The FBI obviously knew something was in the wind ... The FBI did advise Ashcroft to stay off commercial aircraft. The rest of us just had to take our chances.&quot; [San &lt; http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/06/... &gt;  Francisco Chronicle, 6/3/02] CBS's Dan Rather later says of this warning: &quot;Why wasn't it shared with the public at large?&quot; [Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node;=&amp;conte...; &gt;  Post, 5/27/02]

July 31, 2001: The FAA issues another warning to US airlines, citing no specific targets but saying &quot;terror groups are known to be planning and training for hijackings, and we ask you therefore to use caution.&quot; These alerts had expired by 9/11. Note that pilots and flight attendants later claim they were never told about warnings such as these. The airlines also disagree about the content of pre-9/11 warnings generally. For instance, American Airlines states these warnings were &quot;extremely general in nature and did not identify a specific threat or recommend any specific security enhancements.&quot; The text of these warnings remain classified. [CNN, &lt; http://www.cnn.com/interactive/us/0205/intelligence.timeline/content.... &gt;  3/02, Ananova, &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/ananova051702.html &gt;  5/17/02]

Late July 2001 (A): The Taliban Foreign Minister learns that bin Laden is planning a &quot;huge attack&quot; on targets inside America. The attack is imminent, and will kill thousands. He learns this from the leader of the rebel Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which is allied with al-Qaeda at the time. He sends an emissary to pass this information on to the US consul general, and another US official, &quot;possibly from the intelligence services,&quot; also attends the meeting. The message is not taken very seriously. The emissary then takes the message to the Kabul offices of UNSMA, the political wing of the UN. They also fail to take the warning seriously. [Independent, 9/7/02 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/020907independent &gt; , Reuters, &lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=206065&amp;contrass...; &gt;  9/7/02] Isn't it ironic the US destroyed the Taliban, who tried to warn them of the attacks?

Late July 2001 (B): David Schippers, noted conservative Chicago lawyer and the House Judiciary Committee's chief investigator in the Clinton impeachment trial, later claims that FBI agents in Chicago and Minnesota contact him around this time and tell him that a terrorist attack is going to occur in lower Manhattan. According to Schippers, the agents had been developing extensive information on the planned attack for many months. However, the FBI soon pulls them off the terrorist investigation and threatens them with prosecution under the National Security Act if they go public with the information. As a result, they contact Schippers hoping he can persuade the government to take action. Schippers tries to pass the information on to high government officials, but apparently his efforts are ignored. Partly in conjunction with Judicial Watch, the public interest law firm, Schippers is now representing at least ten FBI agents in a suit against the US government in an attempt to have their testimony subpoenaed, which would enable them to legally tell what they know without going to jail. [Judicial &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20020619024543/http:/www.judicialwatch.org... &gt;  Watch, 11/14/01, World Net Daily, &lt; http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25008 &gt;  10/21/01, Alex &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20021114055152/http:/cooperativeresearch.o... &gt;  Jones Show, 10/10/01, note the sources are partisan, Schipper's claims are being reported nowhere else]

August 2001 (A): The German newspaper Der Spiegel later reports that this month the US company Raytheon landed a 727 six times in a military base in New Mexico without any pilots on board. This was done to test equipment making future hijackings more difficult, by allowing ground control to take over the flying of a hijacked plane. [Der &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/derspiegel102801.html &gt;  Spiegel, 10/28/01] Even though Der Spiegel got their information directly from Raytheon, most media lie about it and report after 9/11 that such technology is currently impossible. For instance, the Observer quotes an expert who says &quot;the technology is pretty much there&quot; but still untried. [Observer, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/wtccrash/story/0,1300,552793,00.html &gt;  9/16/01] The New York Times reports on a Bush speech in which he mentioned that the government would give grants to research &quot;new technology, probably far in the future, allowing air traffic controllers to land distressed planes by remote control.&quot; [New York Times, &lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/28/national/28BUSH.html &gt;  9/28/01]

August 2001 (B): At least six 9/11 alleged hijackers, including all of those that boarded Flight 77, live in Laurel, Maryland from about this time. NSA expert James Bamford later states, &quot;the [alleged] terrorist cell that eventually took over the airliner that crashed into the Pentagon ended up living, working, planning and developing all their activities in Laurel, Maryland, which happens to be the home of the NSA. So they were actually living alongside NSA employees as they were plotting all these things.&quot; [Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A52712-2001Sep18?language=pr... &gt;  Post, 9/19/01, BBC, &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/bbc062102.html &gt;  6/21/02]

August 22, 2001 (B): Counter-terrorism expert John O'Neill quits the FBI. He says it's partly because of a recent power play against him, but also because of repeated obstruction of his investigations into al-Qaeda. [New Yorker, &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity &gt;  1/14/02] In his last act, he signs papers ordering FBI investigators back to Yemen to resume the USS Cole investigation, now that Barbara Bodine is leaving as ambassador (they arrive a couple days before 9/11). He never hears the CIA warning about alleged hijackers Alhazmi and Almihdhar sent out just one day later. Because he fell out of favor a few months earlier, he also is never told about Ken Williams' flight school memo, nor about the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui [PBS &lt; http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/john/timeline.html &gt;  Frontline, 10/3/02], nor is he at a June meeting when the CIA revealed some of what it knew about Alhazmi and Almihdhar. [PBS Frontline, &lt; http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/could/ &gt;  10/3/02] The FBI New York office is eventually told of Walid Arkeh's warning that the WTC would be attacked, but presumably not in time for O'Neill to hear it. One can only wonder what the government's &quot;most committed tracker of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network of terrorists&quot; [ &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity &gt; New Yorker, 1/14/02] could have accomplished if he was aware of these things, i.e. he would have traced 9/11 all the way to its plotters in the CIA, however, he was murdered on 9/11 by a gunshot.

August 23, 2001 (B): John O'Neill begins his new job as head of security at the WTC. [New Yorker, &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/020114johnoneillfbi911wtcsecurity &gt;  1/14/02]  A friend says to him, &quot;Well, that will be an easy job. They're not going to bomb that place again.&quot; O'Neill replies, &quot;Well actually they've always wanted to finish that job. I think they're going to try again.&quot; On September 10, he moves into his new office on the 34th floor of the North Tower. That night, he tells colleague Jerry Hauer, &quot;We're due for something big. I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan&quot; (a probable reference to the assassination of Afghan leader General Massoud on September 9). O'Neill is killed the next day in the 9/11 attack. [PBS &lt; http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/john/timeline.html &gt;  Frontline, 10/3/02]

September 6-10, 2001: Suspicious trading occurs on American and United (UAL), the two airlines used in the 9/11 attacks. Between 6 and 7 September, The Chicago Board Options Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 put option contracts [a speculation that the stock will go down] in UAL versus 396 call options [a speculation that stock will go up]. Holders of the put options would have netted a profit of $5 million once the carrier's share price dived after September 11. On 10 September, more trading in Chicago saw the purchase of 4,516 put options in American Airlines, the other airline involved in the hijackings. This compares with a mere 748 call options in American purchased that day. No other airlines saw such trading in their put options. One analyst says: &quot;I saw put-call numbers higher than I've ever seen in 10 years of following the markets, particularly the options markets.&quot; [San &lt; http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/200... &gt;  Francisco Chronicle, 9/19/01, Associated &lt; http://cjonline.com/stories/091901/ter_tradingacts.shtml &gt;  Press, 9/18/01, AP &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20020215082158/http:/cjonline.com/stories/... &gt;  article archived] &quot;To the embarrassment of investigators, it has also emerged that the firm used to buy many of the &quot;put&quot; options ... on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by ‘Buzzy’ Krongard, now executive director of the CIA.&quot; [Independent, &lt; http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/story.jsp?story=99402 &gt;  10/14/01, Independent &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20011014112049/http:/news.independent.co.u... &gt;  article archived] Why didn't this cause a storm of media attention and further investigation?

September 10, 2001 (A): In a speech to the Department of Defense, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announces that the Department of Defense &quot;cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.&quot; CBS later calculates that 25% of the yearly defense budget is unaccounted for, and quotes a long-time defense budget analyst: &quot;[Their] numbers are pie in the sky. The books are cooked routinely year after year.&quot; Coverage of this rather shocking story is nearly nonexistent given the events of the next day.

September 10, 2001 (B): CBS Dan Rather later reports that on this day, bin Laden is admitted to a military hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, for kidney dialysis treatment. Pakistani military forces guard bin Laden. They also move out all the regular staff in the urology department and send in a secret team to replace them. It is not known how long he stayed. [CBS &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/cbs012802.html &gt;  News, 01/28/02]

September 10, 2001 (C): Attorney General Ashcroft rejects a proposed $58 million increase in financing for the bureau's counter-terrorism programs. On the same day, he sends a request for budget increases to the White House. It covers 68 programs, but none of them relate to counter-terrorism. He also sends a memorandum to his heads of departments, stating his seven priorities - none of them relating to counter-terrorism. This is more than a little strange, since Ashcroft stopped flying public airplanes in July due to terrorist threats (see July &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/9-11timeline60pg#ashcroftstops#ashcroftstops &gt;  26, 2001) and he told a Senate committee in May that counter-terrorism was his &quot;highest priority.&quot; [New &lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/01/national/01INQU.html?ei=1&amp;en;=c74c74... &gt;  York Times, 6/1/02, Guardian, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/story/0,11209,719231,00.html &gt;  5/21/02] The Patriot Act I is already sitting on Ashcroft’s desk waiting for 9/11 to happen to usher it into law.

September 10, 2001 (E): According to CBS News, in the afternoon before the attack, &quot;alarm bells were sounding over unusual trading in the US stock options market.&quot; It has been documented that the CIA, the Mossad and many other intelligence agencies monitor stock trading in real time using highly advanced programs such as Promis. Both the FBI and the Justice Department have confirmed the use of such programs for US intelligence gathering through at least this summer. This would confirm that CIA should have had additional advance warning of imminent attacks against American and United Airlines planes.

At least one CEO who would otherwise have died in the WTC attends. Attendees had just arrived when the first WTC attack occurs. This base is the center of the nation's military defenses, and the same base that Bush will fly to later in the day. The timing, probable attendance, and location of the meeting is curious, to say the least, as is the total lack of any mention of the meeting anywhere, except for one aside by a business leader (Anne Tatlock, CEO and President of Fiduciary and Franklin)explaining why she survived the WTC attack.

September 11, 2001 (B): An advertisement for a &quot;homeland security&quot; event in 2002 will mention the following curious sentence: &quot;On the morning of September 11th 2001, Mr. [John] Fulton and his team at the CIA were running a pre-planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a plane were to strike a building. Little did they know that the scenario would come true in a dramatic way that day.&quot; [National Law Enforcement Security &lt; http://www.nlsi.net/hs-alc-info.htm &gt;  Institute, 8/02] Fulton's team is part of the National Reconnaissance Office, which &quot;operates many of the nation's spy satellites.

September 11, 2001 (C): Data recovery experts later looking at 32 hard drives salvaged from the 9/11 attacks discover a surge in credit card transactions from the WTC in the hours before and during the attacks. Unusually large sums of money were rushed through computers even as the disaster unfolded. Investigators say, &quot;There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes in order to move out amounts exceeding $100 million. They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed.&quot; [Reuters, 12/18/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/011218reuters &gt; , CNN, &lt; http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/12/20/wtc.harddrives.idg/ &gt;  12/20/01]

Department of Defense (6/1/01) and FAA (7/12/01) procedure: In the event of a hijacking, the FAA hijack coordinator on duty at Washington headquarters requests the military to provide escort aircraft. Normally, NORAD escort aircraft take the required action. The FAA notifies the National Military Command Center by the most expeditious means.

&quot;Pilots are supposed to hit each fix with pinpoint accuracy. If a plane deviates by 15 degrees, or two miles from that course, the flight controllers will hit the panic button. They’ll call the plane, saying &quot;American 11, you’re deviating from course.&quot; It’s considered a real emergency, like a police car screeching down a highway at 100 miles an hour.&quot; [MSNBC, &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20021104122925/http:/cooperativeresearch.o... &gt;  9/12/01]

If NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) hears of any difficulties in the skies, they begin the work to scramble jet fighters [take off and intercept aircraft that are off course].

8:46 A.M. According to Robert Marr, commander of NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), NORAD is unable to find the location of Flight 11. Finally, someone sees a &quot;green dot that's not identified. Almost as soon as it's discovered, it disappears. It's 8:46 A.M.&quot; At the time, &quot;there are no other missing aircraft.&quot; But then, at 9:02, they see a second unidentified aircraft on a screen, which is Flight 175 crashing into the WTC.

8:46 A.M. At the time of the first WTC crash, three F-16's assigned to Andrews Air Force Base 10 miles from Washington are flying an air-to-ground training mission on a range in North Carolina, 207 miles away. Eventually they are recalled to Andrews and land there at some point after Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon. [Aviation &lt; http://www.aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_awst.jsp?view=story&amp;id;=... &gt;  Week and Space Technology, 9/9/02] F-16's can travel a maximum speed of 1500 mph. Traveling even at 1250 mph, at least one of the F-16's could have returned to Washington within 10 minutes and started patrolling the skies well before 9:00 A.M. Why were they recalled so late, and then ordered back to base (and then to take off again) instead of being sent straight to Washington?

(8:46 A.M.) Flight 77 from Washington goes severely off course. It heads due north for a while, then flies due south and gets back on course. [see USA Today's Flight 77 &lt; http://billstclair.com/911timeline/images/flight77route.jpg &gt;  flight path] It was off course by around 15 miles, and stayed off course for about five minutes.

Col. Timothy Duffy, one of the pilots, before takeoff, a fellow officer had told him &quot;This looks like the real thing.&quot; He says, &quot;It just seemed wrong. I just wanted to get there. I was in full-blower all the way.&quot; A NORAD commander has said the planes were stocked with extra fuel as well. [Aviation &lt; http://www.aviationnow.com/content/publication/awst/20020603/avi_stor... &gt;  Week and Space Technology, 6/3/02] Full-blower is very rare - it means the fighters are going as fast as they can go.

[Air &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/1990s/airforcenews073097.... &gt;  Force News, 7/30/97] An at average speed of 1600 mph, they would have reached New York City in seven minutes - 8:59. An at average speed of 1125 mph, they would have reached it in 10 minutes - 9:02 - still before Flight 175 crashes. Yet according to the NORAD timeline, these planes take about 19 minutes to reach New York City - less than 600 mph. Why so slow??

(9:01 A.M.) Bush later makes the following statement. &quot;And I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower -- the TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself, and I said, 'There's one terrible pilot.

By 8:38, NORAD knew that Flight 11 was hijacked, and by 8:43, they knew Flight 175 was hijacked. The New York Times points out that they also probably knew Flight 77 was hijacked a few minutes after 8:48. [New &lt; http://college4.nytimes.com/guests/articles/2001/09/15/868107.xml &gt;  York Times, 9/15/01] He's had time to think about it - he's been briefed by his National Security Advisor on the situation. So by this time Bush certainly knew two planes were hijacked and headed towards New York City, and probably knew of a third hijacking. Yet he can only think &quot;There's one terrible pilot&quot;?

[Aviation &lt; http://www.aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_awst.jsp?view=story&amp;id;=... &gt;  Week and Space Technology, 9/9/02] The problem with this account is that prior to 9/11, The District of Columbia Air National Guard (located at Andrews) had a publicly stated mission &quot;to provide combat units in the highest possible state of readiness.&quot; Shortly after 9/11 this mission statement on its website is changed, so it merely has a &quot;vision&quot; to &quot;provide peacetime command and control and administrative mission oversight to support customers and DCANG units in achieving the highest levels of readiness.&quot; [DCANG &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/nodate/dchanghomepage.html &gt;  Home Page (before and after the change)]

9:09 A.M. Supposedly, NORAD orders F-16's at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, on battle stations alert. Yet the order to scramble won't come till 9:27 or so, and they won't take off until 9:30. Around this time, the FAA command center reports 11 aircraft either not in communication with FAA facilities, or flying unexpected routes. [Aviation &lt; http://www.aviationnow.com/content/publication/awst/20020603/avi_stor... &gt;  Week and Space Technology, 6/3/02] So why aren't planes scrambled immediately, at 9:09 or even before, to find out what's going on?

9:16 A.M.  The FAA informs NORAD that Flight 93 may have been hijacked. No fighters are scrambled in specific response, now or later (there is the possibility some fighters sent after Flight 77 later headed towards Flight 93). Although this is what CNN learned from NORAD, it’s not clear why NORAD claims it was hijacked at this time (NORAD's own timeline inexplicably fails to say when the FAA told them about the hijack, the only flight they fail to provide this data for). [CNN, 9/17/01 &lt; http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.hijack.warning/ &gt; , NORAD, &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20021024070353/http:/web.archive.org/web/2... &gt;  9/18/01] Note that the crash of Flight 77 is still 25 minutes away. F-16 fighters from Langley Air Force Base could have reached Washington in six minutes if they traveled at 1300 mph (maximum speed for an F-16 is 1500 mph). Even if the fighters were traveling slower, and it took some minutes to get the plane off the ground, they still could easily have made it to Washington in those 25 minutes and prevented the Flight 77 crash.

(9:30 A.M.) The alleged hijackers make an announcement to the passengers in Flight 77, telling them to phone their families as they are &quot;all going to die&quot;. They also told the passengers that they were going to hit the White House. [&quot;When they took over the controls,&quot; Sunday Herald, 9/16/01 &lt; http://www.sundayherald.com/18498 &gt; , &quot;around 9:30,&quot; Cox &lt; http://www.capecodonline.com/cctimes/archives/2001/oct/21/bottomguns2... &gt;  News, 10/21/01] Given this announcement, why are there almost no phone calls from this flight?

(9:32 A.M.) Secret Service agents burst into Vice President Cheney's White House office. They carry him under his arms - nearly lifting him off the ground - and propel him down the steps into the White House basement and through a long tunnel towards an underground bunker. [9:32, Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A42754-2002Jan26 &gt;  Post, 1/27/02, shortly after Bush's speech at 9:30, CBS, &lt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/11/60II/main521718.shtml &gt;  9/11/02] Why didn't this happen to Bush? Was he meant to remain visibly out of the loop? Another article claims this happened to Cheney at 9:05, exactly when Bush was being told of the second WTC hit. [Telegraph, &lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2001%2F12%2F... &gt;  12/16/01] If that's true, the fact that Cheney gets moved to safety and Bush doesn't is even stranger.

(9:41 A.M.)  Flight 77 allegedly crashes into the Pentagon. The section of the Pentagon hit consists mainly of newly renovated, unoccupied offices. Approximately 125 are later determined killed or missing. The surface to air missiles presumably surrounding the Pentagon are not fired in defense. Fighters are supposedly still 105 miles or 12 minutes away.

[NORAD, &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20021024070353/http:/www.cooperativeresear... &gt;  9/18/01] So that means they must have been flying at an average of about 130 mph! Even if one uses the NORAD crash time of 9:37 (which we know is untrue), that still averages to only about 205 mph!

9:58 A.M. A man calls 911 from a bathroom on Flight 93, crying, &quot;We're being hijacked, we're being hijacked!&quot; [Toronto Sun, &lt; http://www.canoe.ca/CNEWSAttack010916/16_week-sun.html &gt;  9/16/01], then reports that &quot;he heard some sort of explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane and we lost contact with him.&quot; [ABC &lt; http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/091101_nw_terrorist_attack_united.html &gt;  News, 9/11/01, AP, &lt; http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2001/09/12attack/ke091201s69... &gt;  9/12/01] One minute after the call began, the line goes dead. [Pittsburgh &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/pittsburghchannel120... &gt;  Channel, 12/6/01] The mentions of smoke and explosions of the recording of his call are now denied.

[Mirror, &lt; http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12192317&amp;metho...; &gt;  9/13/02] If that's true, why is this important fact only denied now, when the FBI got a copy of the recording on 9/11, and let the media report the smoke and explosion story for months?

4:55 PM: BBC announces that WTC 7 has collapsed but it actually hasn’t. BBC made the same mistake in 1943 when they announced that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor 23 minutes before it actually happened. BBC is run by British Intelligence and they preplan their scenario but sometimes they make mistakes which reveal their lies.

5:20 PM: Building 7 of the World Trade Center collapses. [CNN, 9/12/01 &lt; http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/11/chronology.attack/ &gt; ] Though the media claims fires brought the building down, the building's owner Larry Silverstein later recounts the story of the collapse of this 47-story skyscraper in a PBS documentary America Rebuilds, &quot;I remember getting a call from the fire department commander...I said...maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull it. And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.&quot; [PBS &lt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3E-26oVIIs&amp;search;=%22pull%20it%22%20s... &gt;  Documentary]

September 11, 2001 (F): It is later revealed that only hours after the 9/11 attacks, a US &quot;shadow government&quot; is formed. Initially deployed &quot;on the fly,&quot; executive directives on government continuity in the face of a crisis dating back to the Reagan administration are put into effect. Approximately 100 mid-level officials are moved to underground bunkers and stay there 24 hours a day. Officials rotate in and out on a 90-day cycle. When its existence is revealed, some controversy arises because of the exclusion of any Democrats from it. In fact, top Congressional Democrats had never even heard of it until journalists broke the story. [Washington Post, 3/2/02 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/020302post &gt; , CBS, &lt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/01/attack/main502530.shtml &gt;  3/2/02]

September 11, 2001 (H): A National Public Radio correspondent states: &quot;I spoke with Congressman Ike Skelton – a Democrat from Missouri and a member of the Armed Services Committee – who said that just recently the director of the CIA warned that there could be an attack – an imminent attack – on the United States of this nature. So this is not entirely unexpected.&quot; [NPR, 9/11/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010911npr &gt; ] This dramatically contradicts what CIA Director Tenet told the American public.

September 11, 2001 (J): Conveniently for the purpose of framing the attacks on the Arab patsies, two of Atta's bags from an early flight from Portland are not loaded onto Flight 11 and are discovered. They contain a handheld electronic flight computer, a simulator procedures manual for Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft, two videotapes relating to &quot;air tours&quot; of the Boeing 757 and 747 aircraft, a slide-rule flight calculator, a copy of the Koran, Atta's passport, his international driver's license, a religious cassette tape, airline uniforms, a letter of recommendation, &quot;education related documentation,&quot; a note to other alleged hijackers on how to mentally prepare for the hijacking, and Atta's will (written in 1996). [AP, &lt; http://multimedia.belointeractive.com/attack/investigation/1005hijack... &gt;  10/5/01, Sydney Morning &lt; http://old.smh.com.au/news/0109/15/world1/world10.html &gt;  Herald, 9/15/01, Boston &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/bostonglobe091801.html &gt;  Globe, 9/18/01, Independent, 9/29/01 &lt; http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=96697 &gt; , (see also an FBI &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/images/fbi_10.jpg &gt;  affidavit that omits certain items, like the uniforms and the how-to note)] A New Yorker reporter later writes, &quot;many of the investigators believe that some of the initial clues that were uncovered about the terrorists' identities and preparations, such as flight manuals, were meant to be found. A former high-level intelligence official told me, 'Whatever trail was left was left deliberately—for the FBI to chase.'&quot; [New Yorker, 10/1/01 &lt; http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?011008fa_FACT &gt; ] Why would Atta have brought his will onto a plane he knew would be destroyed? Why would the airline uniforms be where they couldn't be used in the hijacking? In fact, why bring anything at all? i.e. these were planted by the CIA to falsely incriminate the Arabs for Bush’s and his Zionist friends’ propaganda purposes!

September 11, 2001 (K): TV news coverage on 9/11 repeatedly shows images of Palestinians rejoicing over the 9/11 attack. According to Mark Crispin Miller, a Professor of Media Studies at New York University who investigated the issue, the footage was filmed during the funeral of nine people killed the day before by Israeli authorities. He said &quot;to show it without explaining the background, and to show it over and over again is to make propaganda for the war machine and is irresponsible.'' [Australian, &lt; http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,2943210... &gt;  9/27/01] Also, conveniently, ex-Israeli Prime Minister Barrack is in the BBC studios spewing his hate propaganda against Arabs and Muslims immediately after the 1st attack.

September 11, 2001 (L):  Five Israelis are arrested for &quot;puzzling behavior&quot; related to the WTC attacks. They are arrested around 4:30 P.M. after having filmed the burning WTC from the roof of their company's building near Liberty State Park, then shouting in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery. They were spotted by a neighbor who called the police and the FBI. The police tracked them down in a van with the words &quot;Urban Moving Systems&quot; written on the side. [Bergen &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/bergenrecord091201.html &gt;  Record, 9/12/01, Ha'aretz, &lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=75266&amp;sw;=mocker... &gt;  9/17/01] One man was found with $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock, another had two passports on him, and a box cutter was found in the van.

The FBI interrogates them for weeks. [Forward, 3/15/02 &lt; http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.03.15/news2.html &gt; ] They are held on immigration violation charges and released 71 days later.

September 11, 2001 (M): Six air traffic controllers who dealt with two of the hijacked airliners make a tape recording describing the events, but the tape is later destroyed by a supervisor without anyone making a transcript or even listening to it.

September 12, 2001: The passport of hijacker Satam Al Suqami is very conveniently found planted a few blocks from the WTC. [ABC &lt; http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/disinfo/deceptions/abc_hunt.html &gt;  News, 9/12/01, ABC &lt; http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/disinfo/deceptions/abc_nosurvivors.... &gt;  News, 9/16/01] What are the odds that this passport became separated from al Suqami or his luggage, and somehow escaped the fireball that consumed the airplane, then the collapse of the buildings? The Guardian says, &quot;the idea that Atta's passport had escaped from that inferno unsinged [tests] the credulity of the staunchest supporter of the FBI's crackdown on terrorism.&quot; [Guardian, &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/story/0,11209,669961,00.html &gt;  3/19/02]. Note the passport did not belong to Atta, as is sometimes claimed.

September 13, 2001: A Pentagon official, when asked if the US shot down Flight 93 (the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania), says &quot;We have not ruled out that.&quot; This is one of many quotes from officials in the first days that fail to rule out that 93 was shot down. [ABC &lt; http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/WTC_PAcrash010912.html &gt;  News, 9/13/01, Pittsburgh &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/pittsburghtribunerev... &gt;  Tribune Review, 9/14/01] On the same day, a flight controller in Nashua claims an F-16 fighter closely pursued Flight 93 until it crashed in Pennsylvania. &quot;Although controllers don't have complete details of the Air Force's chase of the Boeing 757, they have learned the F-16 made 360-degree turns to remain close to the commercial jet. 'He must've seen the whole thing,' the employee said of the F-16 pilot's view of Flight 93's crash’&quot; (Flight controllers have been ordered not to speak publicly about 9/11, but somehow this slipped out). [AP, 9/13/01 &lt; http://www.portland.com/news/attack/010913faa.shtml &gt; , Nashua &lt; http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/main.asp?SectionID=25&amp;SubSectionID;=354... &gt;  Telegraph, 9/13/01] Cheney later tells the Washington Post that he had ordered a plane to shoot down Flight 93, and confirmed that order two more times as the distance between the fighter and the airliner grew closer. So, supposedly, when Flight 93 crashed, Bush had to ask, &quot;Did we shoot it down or did it crash?&quot; [Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A42754-2002Jan26 &gt;  Post, 1/27/02] If the plane was shot down after the passengers had taken it over, would that have looked so bad that one might want to cover it up?

September 13-19, 2001: Members of bin Laden's family and important Saudis are &quot;driven or flown under FBI supervision to a secret assembly point in Texas, and then to Washington from where they left the country on a CIA private charter plane when airports reopened three days after the attacks.&quot; (The same company has been hired by the CIA to fly its torture rendition flights around the World and in Europe). The flights to Texas and Washington occur before the national air ban is lifted. Top White House officials personally approve these evacuations.

They then fly a private 747 out of the country. Multiple 747s with Arabic lettering on their sides are already there, suggesting another secret assembly point. The Tampa flight left from a private Raytheon hangar [Tampa &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20011108145853/http:/www.tampatrib.com/MGA... &gt;  Tribune, 10/5/01] (Raytheon's name keeps coming up in relation to 9/11 - for instance, see September 25, 2001). There have been conflicting reports as to whether the FBI interviewed these people before they left the country. Osama bin Laden's half brother, Abdullah bin Laden, stated that even a month after 9/11, his only contact with the FBI was a brief phone call. [Boston &lt; http://web.archive.org/web/20010927124917/www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/... &gt;  Globe, 9/21/01, New Yorker, &lt; http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?011112fa_FACT3 &gt;  11/5/01] An earlier FBI attempt to investigate Abdullah was obstructed by higher-ups (see 1996). Obviously, if the Binladens had been involved in 9/11, they would have left the US before 9/11, not after.

September 14, 2001 (A): The two &quot;black boxes&quot; for Flight 77 are found. [PBS &lt; http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/wash_9-14.html &gt;  Newshour, 9/14/01] FBI Director Mueller will later say that the boxes provided altitude, speed, headings and other information, but the voice recorder contained &quot;nothing useful.&quot; [CBS, &lt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/25/attack/main501989.shtml &gt;  2/23/02]

September 15-17, 2001: A series of major media articles state that several of the 9/11 alleged hijackers may have had training in US military bases. [New York Times, 9/15/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010915nytimes &gt; , Newsweek, 9/15/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010915newsweek &gt; , Washington Post, 9/16/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010916post &gt; ] Ahmad Alnami, Ahmed Alghamdi, and Saeed Alghamdi even listed the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida as their permanent address on their driver's licenses.

Abdulaziz Alomari attended Brooks Air Force Base Aerospace Medical School in San Antonio, Texas. [Gannett News &lt; http://summeroftruth.org/mcclellan.html &gt;  Service, 9/17/01] &quot;Air Force spokesman Col. Ken McClellan said a man named Mohamed Atta -- which the FBI has identified as one of the five alleged hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 -- had once attended the International Officer's School at Maxwell/Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery, Ala.&quot; [Gannett News Service, 9/17/01 &lt; http://summeroftruth.org/mcclellan.html &gt; ] Atta graduated from the US International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Abdulaziz Alomari graduated from the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The media drops the story after the Air Force makes a not-very-definitive statement, saying that while the names are similar, &quot;we are probably not talking about the same people.&quot; [Washington Post, 9/16/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/010916post &gt; ]  However, the military fails to provide any information about the individuals whose names supposedly match those of the alleged hijackers, making it impossible to confirm or refute the story.

September 16-23, 2001: Reports appear in several news media that some of the people the US says were 9/11 alleged hijackers are actually still alive. Pilot Waleed Al Shehri is one of the men the FBI said crashed a plane into the WTC. His photograph was released, and he acknowledges that he is indeed the Waleed Al Shehri named by the FBI. But, he says, he left the US last year and became a pilot with Saudi Arabian airlines. [BBC, 9/23/01 &lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1559151.stm &gt; ] The Saudi government insists that five of the Saudis mentioned are still alive. [New &lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/21/international/middleeast/21IDEN.htm... &gt;  York Times, 9/21/01] On September 20, FBI Director Mueller says: &quot;We have several others that are still in question.

[BBC, 8/1/02 &lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2165759.stm &gt; ] On September 20, The London Times reported, &quot;Five of the alleged hijackers have emerged, alive, innocent and astonished to see their names and photographs appearing on satellite television...The alleged hijackers were using stolen identities, and investigators are studying the possibility that the entire suicide squad consisted of impostors.&quot; [London Times, &lt; http://www.wanttoknow.info/010920londontimes.hijackers &gt;  9/20/01] Briefly, the press took this story to heart. For instance, a story in the Observer on September 23 put the names of alleged hijackers like Saeed Alghamdi in quotation marks. [Observer, &lt; http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,556695,00.html &gt;  9/23/01] But the story died down after the initial reports, and it was hardly noticed when Mueller stated on November 2, 2001: &quot;We at this point definitely know the 19 alleged hijackers who were responsible,'' and claimed that they were sticking with the names and photos released in late September. [AP, &lt; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/11/02/attack/main316806.shtml &gt;  11/02/02] Yet while many of the names are known to be wrong, these are the same names that appear much later in the 2004 9/11 Commission Report. [9/11 Commission &lt; http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch7.htm &gt;  Report - see graphic slightly over half way down the page] Perhaps embarrassing facts might come out if we knew their real names, such as more terrorists who studied at military bases or were on watch lists.

September 17, 2001 (A): Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R), who claims to have made many secret trips into Afghanistan and even fought with the mujaheddin, describes to Congress a missed opportunity to capture bin Laden. He claims that &quot;a few years ago,&quot; he was contacted by someone he knew and trusted from the 1980's Afghan war, who claimed he could pinpoint bin Laden's location. Rohrabacher passed this information to the CIA, but found the informant wasn't contacted. After some weeks, Rohrabacher used his influence to set up a meeting with agents in the CIA, NSA and FBI. Yet even then the informant wasn't contacted, until weeks later in a &quot;disinterested&quot; way. Rohrabacher concludes &quot;that our intelligence services knew about the location of bin Laden several times but were not permitted to attack him... because of decisions made by people higher up.&quot; [Speech &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?id=1521846767-2190 &gt;  to the House of Representatives, 9/17/01]

September 21, 2001: The Pentagon has told broadcast news reporters that its security cameras did not capture the crash. The attack occurred close to the Pentagon's heliport, an area that normally would be under 24-hour security surveillance, including video monitoring.&quot; [Gertz &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/gertzfile092101.html &gt;  File, 9/21/01] In a later report, an employee at a gas station across the street from the Pentagon that services only military personnel says the gas station's security cameras should have recorded the moment of impact. However, he says, &quot;I've never seen what the pictures looked like. The FBI was here within minutes and took the film.&quot; [Richmond &lt; http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1211_wirepentagon.html &gt;  Times-Dispatch, 12/11/01] A later release of five tiny and grainy images of the crash from a Pentagon security camera shows the government's claim that no security cameras captured the crash was untrue (see March 7, 2002). If there is nothing to hide about the Pentagon crash, why don't they release the footage of it?

September 25, 2001: As details of the passengers on the four hijacked flights emerge, some are shown to have curious connections to the defense company Raytheon, and possibly its Global Hawk pilotless aircraft program (see 1998 and August 2001). Stanley Hall (Flight 77) was director of program management for Raytheon Electronics Warfare.

Late September 2001: Sibel Edmonds is hired as a Middle Eastern languages translator for the FBI. As she later tells CBS's 60 Minutes, she immediately encounters a pattern of deliberate failure in her translation department. Her boss says, &quot;Let the documents pile up so we can show it and say that we need more translators and expand the department.&quot; She claims that if she wasn't slowing down enough, her supervisor would delete her work. Meanwhile, FBI agents working on the 9/11 investigation would call and ask for urgently needed translations. Senator Charles Grassley (R) says of her charges, &quot;She’s credible, and the reason I feel she’s very credible is because people within the FBI have corroborated a lot of her story.&quot; He points out that the speed of such translation might make the difference between a terrorist bombing succeeding or failing.

October 2, 2001 (A): The &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; USA Patriot Act which was on Ashcroft’s desk Sept 10 is introduced in Congress, but is not well received by all. One day later, Senate Majority Leader and future anthrax target Tom Daschle (D) says he doubts the Senate will take up this bill in the one-week timetable the administration wants. As head of the Senate, Daschle has great power to block or slow passage of the bill. [Washington &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/wpost100301b.html &gt;  Post, 10/3/01] On October 4, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman and future anthrax target Patrick Leahy (D) accuses the Bush administration of reneging on an agreement on the anti-terrorist bill. Leahy is in a key position to block or slow the bill. [Washington &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node;=&amp;conte...; &gt;  Post, 10/4/01] The anthrax letters to Daschle and Leahy are sent out on October 9.

October 4, 2001: The first case of anthrax infection, in Florida, appears in the media. Letters containing anthrax continue to be received until October 19. Anthrax letters are sent to NBC, New York Post, Democratic Senator Daschle and Democratic Senator Leahy. There are a number of hoax letters, however, likely sent by the same person to all the recipients of the real anthrax letters, plus to CBS, Fox News, New York Times, and the St. Petersberg Times. Eleven people are infected, five people die.

October 10-11, 2001: The FBI allows the original batch of the Ames strain of anthrax to be destroyed, making tracing the anthrax type more difficult. Suspicions that the anthrax used in the letters was the Ames strain are confirmed on October 17. [New York Times, 11/9/01 &lt; http://www.WantToKnow.info/011109nytimes &gt; , South &lt; http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sfl-1013anthraxchronology.story &gt;  Florida Sun-Sentinel, 12/01] What possible excuse can the FBI have for allowing this destruction, especially when the Ames strain was already suspected?

October 15, 2001: According to the Moscow Times, the Russian government sees the upcoming US conquest of Afghanistan as an attempt by the US to replace Russia as the dominant political force in Central Asia, with the control of oil as a prominent motive: &quot;While the bombardment of Afghanistan outwardly appears to hinge on issues of fundamentalism and American retribution, below the surface, lurks the prize of the energy-rich Caspian basin into which oil majors have invested billions of dollars. Ultimately, this war will set the boundaries of US and Russian influence in Central Asia - and determine the future of oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea.&quot; [Moscow &lt; http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/moscowtimes101501.html &gt;  Times, 10/15/01]

October 16, 2001 (A): &quot;The Financial Services Authority - Britain's main financial regulator - has cleared bin Laden and his henchmen of insider trading.

Furthermore, &quot;none of the nearly 100 people still being sought by the [FBI] is seen as a major suspect.&quot; Of the all the people arrested, only four, Zacarias Moussaoui, Ayub Ali Khan and Mohammed Azmath, and Nabil al-Marabh, a former Boston cabdriver, are likely connected to al-Qaeda.

The report mentions that at least 60 more Israelis have been detained or arrested since 9/11. &quot;There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks, but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance, and not shared it.&quot; When a government source is asked if the Israeli spies knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened, he responds, &quot;The principal question is 'how could they have not known?'&quot; &quot;Investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying ... is considered career suicide.&quot; A highly placed investigator says there are 'tie-ins' between the spy ring and 9/11. But when asked for details, he flatly refuses to describe them, saying, “evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified.&quot; The report also reveals that Amdocs, an Israeli company, is recording virtually every phone call in the US and could be passing information on to the Israeli government (similar claims were first raised in 2000 [Insight, &lt; http://www.insightmag.com/main.cfm/include/detail/storyid/160595.html &gt;  5/29/00]).
