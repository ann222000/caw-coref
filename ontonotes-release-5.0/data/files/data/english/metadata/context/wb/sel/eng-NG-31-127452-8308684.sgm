A GHET

A New York judge is presiding  over the divorce proceedings of
a Jewish couple.  When the final papers  have been signed and
the divorce is complete, the woman thanks the judge and says,
&quot;Now I have to arrange for a Ghet.&quot;  The judge inquires what is
meant by a Ghet.  So, the woman explains that A Ghet is a
religious ceremony that is required under Jewish law to grant a
divorce that is recognized by the Jewish faith.  The judge says,
&quot;You mean a religious ceremony like a Bris?&quot; (a circumcision).
She replies, &quot;Yes, very similar, only in this case you get rid of
the entire prick.
