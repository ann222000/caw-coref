Can anyone offer advice as to the best way to go about reattaching a leg to a
small antique ottoman? One of four legs has come off the piece, having until
now been held on by small one vertical dowel and a lot of glue, the residue of
which is still there. I'd like the resulting joint to be strong enough so that
a person could sit on the piece without imperiling either it or him/her.

By way of background, the entire piece (with legs) is approximately
17&quot;x17&quot;x17-3/4&quot; high, including in the height the beautifully needlepointed
seat. The box part of the top is about 17&quot;x17&quot;x4½&quot; with patterned mahogany
veneer on the outside and what looks like a strip of curved solid mahogany trim
just on top and just under the veneered part. I believe the piece to be 19th
century. It was already much repaired by an apparent amateur before I bought
it (as evidenced by lines of heavy glue all around the inside especially around
the inner top of the legs and inside the small skirt).

The legs are 10&quot; tall, of mildly cabriole style and footless. Each one seems
to be composed of a central core of solid mahogany about 1¼&quot;x1¼&quot; at the top but
that tapers away at the bottom. The dowel now protrudes from the top end of
that central core. At the top of each leg, the central core is surrounded by
what looks like two pieces of well-joined solid mahogany that form a corner
around the outside of the central core. That outer corner continues about 4&quot; to
each side of the leg and the same wood also extends down to form the curves of
the leg. (I hope this makes sense. It's hard to describe.) I think that
outer part of the corner pieces were once connected to the rest of the small
(1½&quot;) skirt that extends down below the box part all around the footstool.
There are little blocks all around the inside of the skirt and by the three
other legs. Only one block, clearly a replacement, is still there for this
particular leg. The other one must have been gone before I bought the
footstool a few years ago. The skirt as a whole has shrunk and there are a
few tiny (less than 1/8&quot;) gaps in it.

I assume I should sand away the existing glue while trying to avoid losing wood
and then should glue the leg back and somehow weight the repair. Is this
right? Questions: What kind of glue is best? (E.g. is Elmer's ok?) Do I
glue the dowel too? How is the repair best weighted or held in place while the
glue dries? Should I turn the footstool right side up and put something heavy
on top or should I rig something to weight the leg down onto the piece while
its all upside down?

Given the amateurish repairs the piece has already had, I assume that it is not
worth taking the stool to a professional at this time. If anyone disagrees,
I'd welcome that input too.

And -- by the way -- I assume this questions fits within antique discussion.
But if there is another newsgroup to which this kind of query should go, I'm
happy to try there too if someone can give me the address.

Thanks in advance.

"/> You'll need to fabriate the missing block and install it so it fits like
the others.
Yes, remove as much of the old glue as possible. The new glue needs to
be able to get into the pores of the wood in order to hold well. Remove
as much of the old glue as possible by sanding/scraping. Be careful not
to remove any of the wood though!
Elmer's CARPENTERS glue works well. (There is a difference)
Squirting glue into crack will not hold, as this appears to have been
done from your description...Item must be clamped tight. Apply glue to
the dowel and hole, and any place where the leg touches the frame. Apply
glue sparingly, don't overdue. Use a &quot;C&quot; Clamp or a large BAR clamp,
whatever will fit your project.
Place a scap block of wood between the jaws of the clamp and the piece
of furniture to avoid scarring it. Clamp it tight and let it squish out
any excess glue. Remove excess glue with a wet rag. It will continue to
seep out or about 20 minutes. Wipe as necessary, being careful not to
get water into your repair.
Let dry a MINIMUM of 24 hours in a warm place.

Thanks Ron for all the advice. It may take me a while to find the right kind
of clamps, but I'll report back on how it all worked out.
