This is from the pagan, 'christian science monitor'.  A group that is a
bunch of Bush fans, who have always been against Israel.  Wake up American
christians, Bush and his followers, will have you and your sons and
daughters march to their deaths against the very Gates of Jerusalem.

Israel may have used experimental weapon in Gaza

In response to Italian TV report, Israel denies use of "Dense Inert Metal
Explosives."

An investigative report
&lt; http://www.rainews24.rai.it/ran24/inchieste/10102006_gaza_eng.asp &gt;  aired
by the all-news state-run satellite channel in Italy alleges that Israel may
have used a new weapon in Gaza recently that causes "especially serious
physical injuries."

Haaretz writes that the &lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/772933.html &gt;
Rai News 24 investigation follows reports by Gaza-based doctors of
inexplicable injuries: an exceptionally large number of wounded who have
lost legs, severe burns, and injuries unaccompanied by metal shrapnel that
comes from a conventional bomb. Some of the doctors also claimed that they
removed particles from wounds that could not be seen in an x-ray machine.

The Italian report identifies the possible cause of such effects may be a
new weapon, launched by unmanned drones, mostly in July, though there were
also reports of similar attacks in August. The Italian investigation raises
the possibility that Israel has developed a weapon similar to the US
military's Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME), "which causes a powerful and
lethal blast, but only within a relatively small radius."

According &lt; http://www.defensetech.org/archives/002434.html &gt;  to the
DefenseTech site, DIME is an effort to solve the problem of battle in an
urban environment without hurting innocent bystanders. But the cost of
having DIME result in "an incredibly destructive blast in a small area" is
having "the destructive power of the mixture cause[s] far more damage than
pure explosive." The US weapon, which is still in the testing phase, is
believed by experts to be "highly carcinogenic and harmful to the
environment."

The Italian investigative report was produced by the same journalists who
exposed the US use &lt; http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1108/dailyUpdate.html &gt;  of
the chemical phosphorous bombs during their assault on Fallujah in Iraq.

The Guardian reports that an Italian laboratory given samples from wounded
patients found that the results were similar to the hypothesis that
DIME-like weapons had been used. But the Israeli military, in a statement
after the show, strongly denies the use of DIME weapons
&lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1924524,00.html &gt; .

"The defence establishment is investing considerable effort to develop
weaponry in order to minimize the risk of injury to innocent civilians. With
regard to allegations of the use of Dime weaponry, the Israel Defence Forces
deny the possession or use of such weapons," it said.

"In addition it should be emphasized that the IDF only uses weapons in
accordance with international law." Some Israeli military experts have also
dismissed the suggestion that a Dime weapon is involved.

The International Committee of the Red Cross had heard reports of similar
injuries
&lt; http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=MAN200608...
icleId=2918&gt; , and was investigating reports of how they were caused. A
spokesman for the Red Cross said they were not yet ready to say what kind of
weapon had caused these injuries.

During the recent conflict with Hizbullah, the Lebanese government accused
Israel of using banned weapons
&lt; http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/lebanon-claims-israel-u...
anned.php&gt; , including phosphorus incendiary bombs and vacuum bombs. Israel
denied the charges. DIME weapons have not been banned because they have not
yet been tested by international authorities.

In an opinion piece for Haaretz, columnist Amira Hass writes that Israel and
its news media often fixate on reports of how many weapons Palestinians
possess, while ignoring the fact that Israel is a "weapons superpower
&lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/776076.html &gt; ."

And therefore, what exists in Israelis' consciousness is not the millions of
cluster bombs - that is, the flying mines - or the tens of millions of bombs
and shells and lethal bullets stored in our arms warehouses and our gun
barrels and the bellies of our helicopters and planes. Although the amount
of such explosives is measured in the millions of tons, it is the 20 tons of
explosives and the few thousand rifles that permeate the Israeli
consciousness.

Israelis are convinced that we are facing an existential danger. But what
has been erased from the Israeli consciousness is that Israel is a weapons
superpower, and that the weapons this state has, as is the nature of all
weapons, are lethal and frightening. The Israeli media, of course,
cooperates with this distortion of reality. It devoutly reports every shot
fired by the Palestinians and every rocket they launch - even when they
cause no harm. But Israeli bullets and shells, which are fired routinely, do
not exist in the media unless there are fatalities, and even those are
quickly forgotten.

But columnist Michael Freund, writing in The Jerusalem Post, argues that
everywhere there are signs that Israel's foes are preparing for another war
&lt; http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1159193465378&amp;page...
Post%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&gt;  and "it's time that we opened our eyes to the
danger that confronts us." Freund writes that Hizbullah, Iran, Hamas, and
Syria all seem to be rearming or preparing for a confrontation, so that
Israel faces an "arc of hate" from "stretching from Beirut and Damascus in
the north, to Tehran in the east, and back to Gaza in the south." Israel, he
argues, needs to act now.

Instead of making this same mistake once again, Israel should take whatever
steps are necessary to interdict weapons shipments to the terrorists, seal
off their supply routes, and hit hard at those who are sending them the
weapons in the first place.

Second, the government needs to begin seriously contemplating the
possibility of launching preemptive and wide-ranging military strikes. Our
foes are openly preparing for war, so why should we allow them the luxury to
choose when it starts?

In a meeting Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Reuters
reports that Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert brought up Iran's nuclear
program, and Russian arm sales
&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR200...
0322.html&gt;  to Iran and Syria. Israel says Russian arms sold to Syria were
used against it during the recent conflict in Lebanon.

But Russian officials, who have stated they don't want Iran to have a
nuclear weapon, said they have not yet seen "a direct threat" coming from
Tehran. The officials also dismissed calls for a halt of weapons shipments
to Damascus and Tehran. The Russians recently signed a contract to supply
the Iranian military with Tor-1M anti-aircraft missile systems. Moscow says
the weapons are purely defensive.
