Question:

This may sound strange, but what _is_, exactly, this &quot;authorship&quot;
thing that people here are arguing about? I know that there were
people, once, who thought Francis Bacon must have written
&quot;Shakespeare's plays,&quot; and that now there are people who think a
nobleman, the Earl of Oxford, wrote them. I assume that the latter
group is just as silly as the former was.

But what people are discussing here seems even more wide-ranging than
that. Does this have anything to do with the notorious, putative
&quot;death of the author&quot;? With the New Historicist (I think) idea that
&quot;social forces&quot; wrote (somehow) &quot;Shakespeare's plays&quot;? (I know almost
nothing about New Historicism except that Harold Bloom has said of it
that &quot;it's neither new nor history.&quot;)

(Since it was mentioned that someone on this newsgroup lives in the
Valley, I keep wanting to say, &quot;Ohmygod, that's like so bitchin',&quot; but
I guess I shouldn't chat.)

Yes, though on the surface they seem less silly. What makes the Baconians
transparently silly is their thinking that Shakespeare's plays constitute
some giant crossword puzzle, with clues across and down. The normal factual
material of historical documents that scholars normally work with, like
names, dates, places, etc, don't interest them very much. Baconians inhabit
some kind of parallel universe where mundane facts of that nature don't
carry much weight.

At first glance, Oxfordianism seems more sensible. It does deal with mundane
factual material like names, dates and places. It is in the interpretations
of this factual material presented in Oxfordian books that the silliness
comes in. Which means you might be several chapters into the book before you
realize you are dealing with a lunatic, whereas with Baconians it's evident
from Page 1.

That sounds about right. I thought the Baconian argument was that
there were these sophisticated codes and acrostics, hiding esoteric
knowledge, scattered throughout the text of the plays, in some
systematic manner, therefore they were written by someone who knew
about codes and esoteric knowledge. If William Shakespeare wrote
them, then the codes and knowledge couldn't be there; if the codes and
knowledge are there, William Shakespeare can't have written them.

There's a lot of weirdness in a lot of places in the humanities,
though. &quot;Social forces&quot; writing plays is weird enough in itself.
Once or twice I've found that the silliness eventually makes sense --
and once or twice I've changed my mind back again. With every genre
and subgenre, practically, having its own weirdnesses, it takes more
and more motivation for me to start trying to read about a new one.
If this one is really entirely random, I think it's not something I'm

Yeah, I'm not really sure where my Carl Sagan books got to. I saw a
planetarium show on Von Daniken once when I was about ten. I don't
remember much, except supposedly X-rays could reconstitute the image
of a missing fingertip from the aura of the rest of the hand.

Not all of Bloom is _that_ hard going, his most recent books
especially. &quot;Agon&quot; is another story. The collection is one of the
reasons I now have a rule that if I'm going to borrow the same book
from the library three or more times, I really ought to get my own
copy. Mostly that's kept me from reading the book in question a third
(or fourth?) time, while I decide whether or not I want to go out and
purchase it.

Strictly speaking, it's not only not the World Wide Web [cf. sp.],
it's not even the Internet, because there are still places (don't ask

I was calling attention to my Americanness by using American slang.
When I first peeked in here, I'm pretty sure I saw some Cockney
gobbledygook I couldn't make head nor tail of. I was also cleverly
referring to the onetime hit song, &quot;Valley Girl,&quot; referring to the
Valley where the Valley Girls live. Somewhere in California, I think.

I don't know if you're limiting your view to &quot;social forces&quot; writing
plays in a structuralist approach, but the biographical approach to
criticism, sometimes combined with the historical, has a lot to
contribute; so, at least in the final analysis, we use the
distinctions you refer to in appraising the author's intentions,
influences, and historical context, IMO. Maybe an author has a
unique, past, approach, and theory of creativity, like Blake, that we
really want to factor in?

Sure he can--and does. My theory about Crowley is that his approach
can be analyses in terms of the pragmatic, because he says things
meaning to create a planned reaction in his audience, and this is a
form of communication. He can argue that Shakespeare does this, too.
He could combine this with a mimetic approach, where he perhaps uses
Freudianism or another startling -ism, but so far I haven't seen him
try for this level of legitimacy. bb

Yes, it isn't fair to claim the Baconians are just nutto would-be
cryptographers. They, like all the other anti-Stratfordians, started out simply
believing that Will just wasn't the right sort of chap to have written plays and
poems seventeen orders of magnitude more brilliant as literature, science,
philosophy and gardening than anyone else had or ever could. So they
accumulated &quot;evidence&quot; against him such as absence of school attendance,
documents indicating he sued people, etc. The finding of secret messages in the
works followed. I think that it inevitably has to for such people--because the
lack of real evidence for their belief systems will eventually bother even them.
Hence, the jump into texts that, when decoded, directly indicate . . . The
Truth. See, for instance, the way the Oxfordians are slowly turning to a secret
text in the Puttenham book, for example. And Marlovians have decoded the
inscription on Shakespeare's monument as a secret message in favor of their
belief system.

Mr. Crowley is being sarcastic; he has posted almost exactly those
same words repeatedly in support of his belief that knowledge of an
author's life is so crucial to understanding his work that, if you
don't have the biographical data at hand, you can't say anything
interesting. Thus, in his view, we Stratfordians are unable to read
Shakespeare, because we don't &quot;know&quot; that his works were written by
the Earl of Oxenford.

As you'll discover if you read further into Mr. Crowley's rantings, he
doesn't himself know much about Oxenford's life. He has invented a
story in which Oxenford is Queen Elizabeth's intimate friend, for
which there isn't the slightest evidence, and shares pastimes with her
that I am too delicately minded to describe and whose existence is
likewise undiscernible in the evidence.

Even were that not the case, his extreme biographicalism (if I may
coin a word) is dubious. By his standards, we cannot read Homer, about
whose life we possess not a shred of reliable information, or any of
the other numerous authors whose lives are documented scantily or not
at all.

There are few historians, or historians of
science, who would go along with you
there. They care passionately who did what.
And it is accepted that the discovery has,
in some strange way, aspects of the

We know very few facts about the life of
the Stratman. I think my list is a pretty
good summary of the most significant.
I note you don't seek to add any.
I could go on about his money-lending,
his litigation, his dealing (and double-
dealing) in land and property, his will,
his hoarding of grain in time of famine,
his 'signatures', the records made of him
by his family, and so on and on . . . but
not one fact that I could state, nor one
that you could find out, would help
support the case that he was, in reality,
the Great Bard.

About 70 documentary records of the
man survive from his lifetime. Another
30 or so come from soon after his death.
Not one indicates that he was poet or a
playwright.

I believe that I am what most people would call an anti-
Stratfordian, but I don't recognize this as anything like
an accurate description of how I personally came to have
the opinions I do concerning Shakespeare's authorship. I
didn't start out with the belief that William Shakespeare
couldn't (for whatever reason) have written the plays
attributed to him, and I still don't believe that, as it
happens.

I do find it somewhat difficult to relate what we know
about Shakespeare's life to the competencies demonstrated
in the works, but still don't think it impossible for him
to have written them. I just think it far more likely he
had a *lot* of 'help' from elsewhere.

"/>

Yes, I think there is a lot of truth in what Bob says. The
very nature of any anti-Stratfordian's belief is that what
Bob calls the 'real evidence' is not to be trusted - much
of it having either been fabricated to promote a myth, or
unknowingly perpetuated by those who believed it. This
does mean that such evidence 'antis' present in support
of their beliefs will often have been either accidentally
left behind, or deliberately concealed.

Where most anti-Stratfordians go wrong, however - and
Marlovians are as guilty as anyone in this - is in failing
to understand that there are certain requirements which
must be met before *any* alleged 'hidden message' from
around that time can be taken seriously:

1) It must *say* something, so a name on its own is
probably not good enough, and what it says must make as
much sense and be as grammatically correct as is reason-
able in the circumstances. (For example, this rule may
have to be relaxed a bit if both the plaintext *and* the
cyphertext must obey it).

2) There must be a clue, key, or instruction for finding
the message, which can be written down fairly simply,
although this may be inferred, and need not be either
clearly specified or known to have been used before.

3) The *probability* of finding that message (or an equal-
ly lucid one) by that method (or one of equal simplicity)
must be shown statistically to be so low as to be almost
impossible to have happened by chance.

Where most *Stratfordians* go wrong is in being unable
(whether through a lack of intelligence, knowledge, or
courage - or simply too fixed a mind-set) to recognize
when such requirements have been met.

One example off the top of my head. In one of his plays, Shakespeare gives
Bohemia a sea-coast, which Ben Jonson produced as an example of how slapdash
he was in matters of fact. Charlton Ogburn in his book disagrees. Since a
Bohemian prince was at that time ruling the Habsburg Empire, which reached
as far south as the Mediterranean, it means that we're justified in saying
that Bohemia had a sea-coast. Rather as (to extend the logic) we could say
after 1603 that the English Channel was &quot;the Scottish coast&quot;, because James
VI of Scotland was now James I of England. A century later, of course, it
would become &quot;the German coast&quot;.

The biggest problem that Oxfordians have is not so much a lack of arguments,
because there are some that could reasonably be pursued, but an inability to
distinguish between good arguments and bad ones. They seem not to know that
merely establishing some train of connective logic, as in the above example,
does not give an argument credibility. They are hamstrung by their continual
failure to know how much the average person will swallow. It means that any
arguments they produce that we might go along with, at least provisionally,
are swamped by those that no one except another Oxfordian would believe. So
far I've read three Oxfordian books, and all three suffer from that same
lack of discrimination. It seems to be an Oxfordian disease.

When will you ever state your boilerplate accurately, Paul? Let me do it for

My first addition is to indicate that there are MANY documentary records from

It would be more accurate to say that anti-Stratfordians try to
explain away all records that do indicate that Shakespeare of
Stratford was a poet or playwright, e.g., the Stratford Monument, the
First Folio, Ben Jonson's recollections in &quot;Timber&quot;, the references to
the playwright as an actor, etc. Mr. Crowley may, if he pleases,
believe that a glover's son from Stratford-upon-Avon lacked the

I agree that this argument could well be seen
as on the fringes of lunacy. But, then we all
see numerous ones as bad as this every day
-- in this newsgroup for a start. It's almost
typical: Ogburn has a problem here; he cannot
see a good answer; so he grasps at a handy
passing straw. In reality, he's no worse than a
lot of others. The test here might be to ask
those propounding such an argument, whether
they thought it strong, or whether its acceptance
was fundamental to their beliefs. In this case,
I'm sure we'd invariably get a definite 'no' from
Oxfordians to both questions.

There is a fundamental problem on this matter,
often discussed in this NG. The alternative
(superficially) is to believe that those who put
on the plays, for year after year (including the
theatre managers and the actors) and those who
were in the audience (including the royal court
and the nobility) were entirely ignorant of the
basic facts of European geography OR that they
simply did not care when it was hopelessly
misrepresented on stage. (Also, we have to
assume that the actors, and the theatre company
generally did not mind being seen as ignorant
clod-hoppers by their aristocratic audiences.)

Stratfordians ignore this question . . . or try to
dodge it in various ways -- all at least as 'lunatic'
as Ogburn's.

It is a conundrum -- and the answer IMO is to
question the traditional idea of the way in which
the plays were mounted and produced -- and
come up with an entirely different picture of the
author, his relationship with his 'public', and of
the sense of humour he possessed.

But that is another story.

Since I'll be going on vacation (out of Internet range) in a couple of
days, I feel safe in leaping into this argument. Let's assume arguendo
that your decipherment of the Stratford monument were irrefragible.
That would prove, at most, that an unknown individual believed (or, to
be more precise, asserted), for unknowable reasons, that Christopher
Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare. His untestable opinion would
then have to be weighed against the large body of evidence identifying
William Shakespeare of Stratford as the author. There would obviously
be either error or dishonesty on one side or the other. Why should we
assume that the unknown cryptographer, rather than Condell, Hemmings,
Jonson, etc., was the accurate purveyor of facts?

Well, I don't think I know the answer, and the only thing I can think
of is that perhaps &quot;Bohemia&quot; is meant to personify the sovereign. And
then the idea would be something like, &quot;The sovereign of Bohemia (now)
has access to a warm-water port [so he is now something of a threat to
our own commercial interests].&quot; Thus, this really doesn't seem all
that crazy. Maybe Shakespeare even thought that country-names were
supposed to be used that way. What _I_ would call &quot;lunatic&quot; is
suddenly talking about faster-than-light travel, or something, as if
it were known by everyone to be possible. They don't go that far, do
they?

What I know of statistical studies of vocabulary, for instance, don't
particularly inspire me with much confidence. But on the other hand,
it seems that a statistical argument, if any could be produced, might
reasonably be more useful than an argument like, &quot;he's not the type of
person to make _that_ mistake.&quot; I'm not sure. I don't know enough
about statistics to follow that up, and I don't know enough about the
kinds of people who write plays like Shakespeare's to know what
mistakes they might or might not make. I don't know of any book that
covers just this kind of thing.

And hide my self from SHAME, sith that myne eyes doe see,
Ah, a alantida my deare dame, hath thus tormented me. - *E.O.*

---------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;I am writing this to make known to other readers what may be
the first sonnet sequence in English written by an Englishwoman.
It consists of four sonnets and two quatrains in which
the supposed poet, Anne Cecil de Vere, Countess of Oxford (1556-88)
mourns the death (in 1583) of her new-born infant son, Lord Bulbecke.
The sequence first appeared in print in Pandora (1584),
a slender book of verse otherwise attributed to John SOOWTHERN
and dedicated to the infant's father, Edward de Vere:
----------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;Four Epytaphs made by the Countes [sic] of Oxenford,
after the death of her young Sonne, the Lord Bulbecke, &amp;c.&quot;

Idall, for *ADON*, ne'er shed so many tears:
Nor Thet' for Pelid: nor Phoebus, for Hyacinthus
Nor for *ATIS*, the mother of Prophetesses:
As for the death of Bulbecke, the Gods have cares.
At the bruit of it, the Aphroditan Queen,
Caused more silver to distill from her eyes
Than when the drops of her cheeks raised Daisies:
And to die with him, mortal she would have been.
The Charits, for it break their Peruqs of gold:
The Muses and the NYMPHS of CAVEs: I behold&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------
The first biblical notice of a CAVE occurs
in the history of Lot (Gen. 19:30).

The next we read of is the CAVE of Machpelah (q.v.), which Abraham
purchased from the sons of HETH (Gen. 25:9, 10). It was the
burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also of Isaac,
Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob (Gen. 49:31; 50:13).

The CAVE of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural CAVERN,
where David hid himself from Saul (1 Sam. 22:1, 2).

1 Samuel 22:1 David therefore departed thence, and saved
himself in the CAVE of Adullam: and when his brethren and
all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
22:2 And there gathered unto him all men that were in trouble and all
men that were in debt, and all those that were vexed in mind, and
he was their prince, and there were with him about four hundred men.

CAVEs were frequently used as dwelling-places (Num. 24:21; Cant. 2:14;
Jer. 49:16; Obad. 1:3). &quot;The excavations at Deir Dubban, on the south
side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh, are probably the dwellings of
the Horites,&quot; the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The pits or
cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as prisons (Isa. 24:22;
51:14; Zech. 9:11). Those which had niches in their sides were
occupied as burying-places (Ezek. 32:23; John 11:38).

Genesis makes a big to-do about Abraham buying a field
with a CAVE at one end to bury his wife Sara:

Gen 23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed
to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of
HETH, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17: And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
Mamre, the field, and the CAVE which was therein, and all the trees
that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about,
were made sure
18: Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the
children of HETH, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
19: And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the CAVE
of the field of Machpelah before Mamre:
the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

Later Abraham is buried there himself:

8: Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age,
an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
9: And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the CAVE of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,
which is before Mamre;

there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

I hope this (like my previous post on this subthread) doesn't come
across as too brusque. I mean these comments seriously.

&gt;&gt; In the sciences, a theory discovered by a particular person will
&gt;&gt; eventually be merged into the science as a whole, so it no longer
&gt;&gt; matters who did what.

&gt; There are few historians, or historians of
&gt; science, who would go along with you
&gt; there. They care passionately who did what.

"/>

In most science as it's actually practiced today, and as it's been
practiced throughout most of history, it's as impossible to determine
who did what, precisely, as it would be to discover who painted some
particular ear in a painting out of some particular medieval studio.

And much history revolves around the inevitable fact that the answers
to most questions can't even remotely possibly be retrieved.

What historians do care about, as anybody in any scholarly profession
would, is the discovery of some piece of evidence that would prove or
disprove some theory concerning who did what, or when.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And it is accepted that the discovery has,
&gt; in some strange way, aspects of the
&gt; character of the scientist. So 'gravity' and
&gt; the spectrum, etc., are inextricably linked
&gt; to Newton, and Relativity reflects the
&gt; mind of Einstein.

"/>

Discoveries only seem to be related to the personality of the
discoverer when the discovery has turned out to be wrong. (The same
is true in literature. Good literature transcends time and space.
Only bad literature shows traces of its age's prejudice.) All truths
are the same, each error errs in its own way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But in literature, I think, the distinctions
&gt;&gt; between one writer and another are important, if not necessarily
&gt;&gt; meaningful in themselves.

&gt; Of course they are meaningful in themselves.

&gt;&gt; How much writing about literature would be
&gt;&gt; left if you couldn't compare Byron to Shelley or Eliot to Pound?
But
&gt;&gt; it doesn't really even matter if Wordsworth's poems were written by
&gt;&gt; his sister Dorothy instead.

&gt; Two people, with close genetic inheritances
&gt; who lived together and shared nearly all
&gt; their experiences, might well have produced
&gt; near-identical work.

"/>

Personally, I don't believe biology has that much to do with anything.
But, basically, that seems plausible. I don't know whether or not
it's true, and I suspect it isn't. I think most studies that have
actually been done tend not to support that hypothesis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The TRUE SECT believes the Great Bard
&gt;&gt;&gt; was born into a house of illiterates in a tiny
&gt;&gt;&gt; provincial town (with 210 houses), stayed
&gt;&gt;&gt; there, marrying at 18 and having three kids
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the time he was 21 . . . but somehow got
&gt;&gt;&gt; to London in his mid or late 20s and then
&gt;&gt;&gt; STARTED a literary career . . . from which
&gt;&gt;&gt; he retired at the 'elderly' age of his mid-
&gt;&gt;&gt; forties, forgetting in the meantime, to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure that his children learnt to read.

&gt;&gt; That's not quite what the books I've read say about William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. You can't just pull individual facts out of entire
&gt;&gt; books, and make up your own argument with them.

&gt; We know very few facts about the life of
&gt; the Stratman. I think my list is a pretty
&gt; good summary of the most significant.
&gt; I note you don't seek to add any.
&gt; I could go on about his money-lending,
&gt; his litigation, his dealing (and double-
&gt; dealing) in land and property, his will,
&gt; his hoarding of grain in time of famine,
&gt; his 'signatures', the records made of him
&gt; by his family, and so on and on . . . but
&gt; not one fact that I could state, nor one
&gt; that you could find out, would help
&gt; support the case that he was, in reality,
&gt; the Great Bard.

"/>

Okay, let's see -- how might I refute this argument of yours? I think
that's a reasonable way to see if your method is sound. You give a
capsule summary of the important, most objective points, agreeing that
I might modify the list if I see fit. Then you add a significant list
of topics of (I might want to say) dubious relevance. I might, I
think fairly, conclude that these topics are what you really want to
talk about, and that you are using the subject of this man's biography
as merely a hook on which to hang your own discussion. Then you
conclude that your argument cannot prove my case. To even minimally
address your argument, I would have to concede that this list of
topics is relevant, I would have to provide additional support for the
idea that these topics are worth discussing, and I would have to
research these topics and think about them in some depth. Or, I could
ignore the middle part of the &quot;argument&quot; entirely -- but then there's
little left, isn't there?

If you provided reasonably detailed references (to secondary
literature) in your treatment of those topics, I _might_ find
something of interest to me, in some way other than what I just
described.

If I were only interested in what other people have said about the
biography, and not in analyzing the content of what they've said, I
could probably summarize your argument in some interesting or
informative way, I guess. I might even be able to analyze the
argument, your choice of evidence, and so forth, in some way. But if
a method, to be valid, needs to be falsifiable, this one seems not
valid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; About 70 documentary records of the

"/>

I don't know how these documentary records, either in their numbers or
in their contents, relate to the sets of similar records for his
contemporaries. I can see what you apparently believe the
significance of the fact is, but that's about it. I could use your
argument by saying, &quot;Paul Crowley believes thus-and-such,&quot; but I'd
still probably have to decide what I'm going to think, myself, about
Paul Crowley's believing this.

Yes indeed, and it is a point that I have made here
myself on several occasions. In my essay I also quote
William and Elizebeth Friedman, who wrote:

&quot;It does not matter whether what the solution says is
true or not; it may be a pack of lies, but that is not
the cryptologist's business. The important thing is
that it must say something, and say it intelligibly.&quot;

I do wonder, in fact, whether rather fewer people would
simply reject it out of hand if they realized that this
was the case. The whole Stratfordian edifice would not
come tumbling down if this hidden message was accepted
without doubt to have been intentional.

The most that such an acceptance would do, at least to
start with, is to make the possibility that Marlowe
survived and contributed to the works of Shakespeare a
legitimate area for serious academic study and debate,
and not just the realm of authorship 'crackpots' like me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why should we assume that the unknown cryptographer,

I would not suggest, of course, that one should 'assume'
any such thing. Clearly it would need to be considered
in the light of everything else we know, or may infer,
about the whole situation. What this would *now* include,
however, would be a serious consideration of what the
results might have been if the monument's message *had*
been true, and in that case what Jonson *et al* might
have been *really* saying.

P.S. To be precise the First Folio does not identify
William Shakespeare &quot;of Stratford&quot; as the author. It
refers to the author's &quot;Stratford moniment&quot; which would
still apply. The hidden message also has 'Shakspeare'
as the author, but indicates that this name had in fact
been used to cover both of them - the 'dead' one (Art)

&gt;&gt; Stratfordians ignore this question . . . or try to

&gt;&gt; as Ogburn's.

&gt; Dodging a question, if that's what you think they are doing, might be
&gt; dishonest, but it couldn't be called lunatic.

"/>

If everything you do and say implies that
your firm belief that everyone is controlled
by aliens who inhabit most people's rectums
-- but you never actually say so, are you a
'lunatic'?

Ogburn openly questioned the 'aliens in
rectums' notion, but because his thinking
(along with that of all others) had become
so screwed-up, his solution to this particular
problem was not much better than the
prevailing one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The biggest problem that Oxfordians have is not so much a
&gt;&gt;&gt; lack of arguments, because there are some that could
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably be pursued, but an inability to distinguish between
&gt;&gt;&gt; good arguments and bad ones.

&gt;&gt; You need to come up with MUCH better examples
&gt;&gt; than that you present above -- if you are to show
&gt;&gt; that you have any case at all.

&gt; The fact that I do have a case has already been acknowledged by you in an
&gt; earlier paragraph of your post:-

"/>

So, it seems, you have NO OTHER
examples at all. That marginal one
of Ogburn taking a different view on
Shakespeare's perplexing geographical
'mistakes' is the sum total of your case.

How pathetic can you get?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I agree that this argument could well be seen
&gt;&gt;as on the fringes of lunacy.

The 'fringes of lunacy' are not 'lunacy'.
And &quot;could well be seen [to be] . . .&quot;
does not mean that it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems you forget from one moment to the next what you yourself have
&gt; written.

You seem unable to read with the least
discrimination. Also, as others have
pointed out to you, definitions of 'lunacy'
are slippery. The looseness of the language
in this thread came from you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact that Ogburn has presented this argument at all, instead of
&gt; excising it from his book, is an indication that he did not consider it a
&gt; lunatic argument himself, and did not think his readership would consider it
&gt; lunatic. It thus becomes a very good example supporting my contention that
&gt; Oxfordians have difficulty distinguishing between good arguments and bad
&gt; ones.

"/>

It's more a question of a different approach.
There are occasions for the articulation of
arguments about which you are far from certain.
One is when the whole field of knowledge is so
open and confused, that no one knows in which
direction the truth may lie as, say, in Chemistry
around 1700. THAT is very roughly the situation
today as regards Shakespeare and the authorship,
meaning and purpose of much Elizabethan literature.

You would undoubtedly find much of that
discussion 'lunatic', and in retrospect (in a few
hundred years' time) there may be others who will
say the same -- as we now say much the same
about much of 17th c Alchemy -- but they will
regard your conception of 'Shakespeare' as
more primitive than witchcraft.

&gt;&gt; Well good for you, Colin. But does this have any bearing

&gt;&gt; terms for many years now, so what you avoid using is
&gt;&gt; unlikely to have many of us changing them now.

&gt; To begin with, my name is not Colin. If you still think it is, all I can
&gt; say is that you're entitled to your opinion no matter how incorrect and
&gt; uninformed it may be. In this instance, however, I assure you that you are
&gt; distinctly incorrect in such an assumption. In all probability, if there
is
&gt; such a one named Colin of whom posts to this newsgroup, I wouldn't even
&gt; live in the same part of the world as he.

&gt; Succinctly, just because certain terms have been adopted by the majority
of
&gt; people doesn't mean that they have to be accepted and used by everyone
&gt; else. Since we supposedly possess freedom I remain free to use such terms
&gt; as I please, irrespective of that which others do and that which is
&gt; considered acceptable at any given point in time. Terminologies that are
&gt; deemed as acceptable by the majority shouldn't stiffle the freedom of the
&gt; individual to their right to personal expression. Hence, Peter, I respect
&gt; your choice to continue using the appellation anti-Stratfordian. Also,
&gt; corrections and adaptations to language are indeed ongoing. This is an
&gt; aspect of the evolution of language as it is the evolution of the
&gt; mentality of genus homo of Terra.

&gt; Given that which I've said in the foregoing, I don't know why you seem to
&gt; be under the mistaken impression that I expect you to utilise the term
&gt; non-Stratfordian instead of anti-Stratfordian. I didn't either state nor
&gt; infer in my previous posts that you are required to so do. I, however, did
&gt; state that I prefer to not use the designation anti-Stratfordian.
&gt; Egocentric interpretations of that which someone said often cloud the
&gt; vision.

&gt;&gt; No it isn't. There is no question that there is 'real
&gt;&gt; evidence' that William Shakespeare wrote the plays. I
&gt;&gt; personally think we are being conned, but that doesn't
&gt;&gt; stop it being real evidence, any more than the lies of
&gt;&gt; someone perjuring himself are.

&gt; Such is your opinion and you are entitled to it. Nonetheless, it's an
&gt; assumption that it's real evidence. Appearances can in many instances be
&gt; deceptive. Apparent evidence is not real evidence, anymore than the
&gt; reflection of someone in a mirror is that person themselves. One is the
&gt; real, while the other is the appearance of the real. They are two distinct
&gt; things. That distinction is the difference between the true and the false.
&gt; In other words, it's not enough to designate something as evidence when
&gt; it's not really evidence but an opinion of something that's an illusion,
&gt; just a thought in the mind of the thinker without any substantive reality.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It could be equally asserted that there is no &quot;real
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence&quot; to William Shakespeare having written the
&gt;&gt;&gt; works attributed to him. Which camp, as it were, is
&gt;&gt;&gt; correct if every camp makes such an assertion?

&gt;&gt; Such assertions are not evidence. Historical records
&gt;&gt; (including assertions) are.

&gt; While I was not saying nor inferring that mere assertions are real
&gt; evidence, it is equally true that when an assertion is supported by real
&gt; evidence that assertion becomes more than just an assertion.

&gt; What you are saying pertaining to historical records is an assumption, an
&gt; expressed opinion, not a fact. Historical records, for the record, aren't
&gt; necessarily correct. Many times recorded history has to be revised and
&gt; they are often tampered with in their initial or subsequent recording.
&gt; Historical representations alone are no real evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mostly, the term &quot;real evidence&quot;, as in no accepted
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence to the individual(s) making such a statement,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is used in an assumptive and derogatory context to
&gt;&gt;&gt; blindly refute an opposing statement.

&gt;&gt; Neither Bob nor I (who seem to oppose each other at
&gt;&gt; every available opportunity) are guilty of this, I trust. If
&gt;&gt; you think you know better, do tell.

&gt; For heavens sake, get over yourself! In many instances I was not referring
&gt; to you or indeed any particular person, I was making a general statement
&gt; because you were kind enough to respond to my response to a posting
&gt; relevant to this thread. Learn, therefore, to extend yourself beyond
&gt; yourself. Don't automatically take things personally.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Anent&quot;? Don't you come the old &quot;anent&quot; with us, squire!
&gt;&gt; That's John W. Kennedy's word, and don't you forget it.

&gt; Anent is the word I used and anent it stays. I need no one to dictate to
me
&gt; otherwise. It is neither John W. Kennedy's word or for that matter anyone
&gt; else's.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the theory they hold to as being the correct one. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; seems to me that most people don't even know how to
&gt;&gt;&gt; reason correctly.

&gt;&gt; Indeed they don't, Esso, Do you?

&gt; Anyone with real intelligence, real knowledge and real wisdom (and such
are
&gt; unfortunately rare persons) would impart that knowledge and wisdom with
&gt; due care, not to those who would seek it just for fun, to play mental
&gt; games of disputation and psuedo-intellectualistic manipulations.
&gt; Contemptuousness and egotistic utterances will not gain their favour.

&gt;&gt; ...Why are you so anti Stratfordians, by the way?

&gt; Why are you so argumentative? Why do you assume so much? Why do you play
&gt; mental games? Such is not the mark of real intelligence, it is but
&gt; pseudo-intellectualism. No one who is in possession of real intelligence,
&gt; real knowledge and real wisdom will suffer such for long, their thundering
&gt; silence mark their stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; thereby negating the possibility of cyphers and concealed
&gt;&gt;&gt; substantive meanings to words and phrases. It could be,
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore, possible that rather than cyphers, codes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; acrostics and concealed meanings being &quot;fabricated to
&gt;&gt;&gt; promote a myth&quot;, as you put it,

&gt;&gt; Read it again, my friend. That was not what I said.

&gt; Learn to interpret differently, mon ami, as I was conveying my thoughts
&gt; relevant to this thread. You see, it had nothing to do with you. Why must
&gt; everything be about you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians ignore this question . . . or try to
&gt;&gt;&gt; dodge it in various ways -- all at least as 'lunatic'
&gt;&gt;&gt; as Ogburn's.

&gt;&gt; Dodging a question, if that's what you think they are doing, might be
&gt;&gt; dishonest, but it couldn't be called lunatic.

&gt; If everything you do and say implies that
&gt; your firm belief that everyone is controlled
&gt; by aliens who inhabit most people's rectums
&gt; -- but you never actually say so, are you a
&gt; 'lunatic'?

&gt; Ogburn openly questioned the 'aliens in
&gt; rectums' notion, but because his thinking
&gt; (along with that of all others) had become
&gt; so screwed-up, his solution to this particular
&gt; problem was not much better than the
&gt; prevailing one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The biggest problem that Oxfordians have is not so much a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lack of arguments, because there are some that could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably be pursued, but an inability to distinguish between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good arguments and bad ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to come up with MUCH better examples
&gt;&gt;&gt; than that you present above -- if you are to show
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you have any case at all.

&gt;&gt; The fact that I do have a case has already been acknowledged by you in
an
&gt;&gt; earlier paragraph of your post:-

&gt; So, it seems, you have NO OTHER
&gt; examples at all. That marginal one
&gt; of Ogburn taking a different view on
&gt; Shakespeare's perplexing geographical
&gt; 'mistakes' is the sum total of your case.

"/>

Crowley tactic #1: change the subject.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; How pathetic can you get?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree that this argument could well be seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;as on the fringes of lunacy.

&gt; The 'fringes of lunacy' are not 'lunacy'.
&gt; And &quot;could well be seen [to be] . . .&quot;
&gt; does not mean that it is.

&gt;&gt; It seems you forget from one moment to the next what you yourself have
&gt;&gt; written.

&gt; You seem unable to read with the least
&gt; discrimination.

"/>

&quot;Discrimination&quot; in this case meaning &quot;however I want.&quot;

Also, as others have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; pointed out to you, definitions of 'lunacy'
&gt; are slippery. The looseness of the language
&gt; in this thread came from you.

"/>

Crowley tactic #2: accuse others of what he is guilty of.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The fact that Ogburn has presented this argument at all, instead of
&gt;&gt; excising it from his book, is an indication that he did not consider it
a
&gt;&gt; lunatic argument himself, and did not think his readership would
consider it
&gt;&gt; lunatic. It thus becomes a very good example supporting my contention
that
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians have difficulty distinguishing between good arguments and bad
&gt;&gt; ones.

&gt; It's more a question of a different approach.
&gt; There are occasions for the articulation of
&gt; arguments about which you are far from certain.
&gt; One is when the whole field of knowledge is so
&gt; open and confused, that no one knows in which
&gt; direction the truth may lie as, say, in Chemistry
&gt; around 1700. THAT is very roughly the situation
&gt; today as regards Shakespeare and the authorship,
&gt; meaning and purpose of much Elizabethan literature.

&gt; You would undoubtedly find much of that
&gt; discussion 'lunatic', and in retrospect (in a few
&gt; hundred years' time) there may be others who will
&gt; say the same -- as we now say much the same
&gt; about much of 17th c Alchemy -- but they will
&gt; regard your conception of 'Shakespeare' as
&gt; more primitive than witchcraft.

&gt; Paul.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right, of course. Authorship is
&gt;&gt;&gt; irrelevant. It does not matter who wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; what -- so long as we have the texts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So it's Byron's or Chaucer's or Scott

&gt;&gt; In the sciences, a theory discovered by a particular person will

&gt;&gt; it doesn't really even matter if Wordsworth's poems were written by

&gt; around that time can be taken seriously:

&gt; 1) It must *say* something, so a name on its own is
&gt; probably not good enough, and what it says must make as
&gt; much sense and be as grammatically correct as is reason-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Question:

&gt;&gt;&gt; This may sound strange, but what _is_, exactly, this &quot;authorship&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing that people here are arguing about?

&gt;&gt; You're right, of course. Authorship is
&gt;&gt; irrelevant. It does not matter who wrote
&gt;&gt; what -- so long as we have the texts.
&gt;&gt; So it's Byron's or Chaucer's or Scott
&gt;&gt; Fitzgerald's 'Wuthering Heights' and
&gt;&gt; Hemingway's or Longfellow's or Dylan
&gt;&gt; Thomas's 'War and Peace' etc., etc,. . . .
&gt;&gt; and who cares . . . or should care?

&gt; In the sciences, a theory discovered by a particular person will
&gt; eventually be merged into the science as a whole, so it no longer
&gt; matters who did what. But in literature, I think, the distinctions
&gt; between one writer and another are important, if not necessarily
&gt; meaningful in themselves. How much writing about literature would be
&gt; left if you couldn't compare Byron to Shelley or Eliot to Pound? But
&gt; it doesn't really even matter if Wordsworth's poems were written by
&gt; his sister Dorothy instead.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that there were
&gt;&gt;&gt; people, once, who thought Francis Bacon must have written
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Shakespeare's plays,&quot; and that now there are people who think a
&gt;&gt;&gt; nobleman, the Earl of Oxford, wrote them. I assume that the latter
&gt;&gt;&gt; group is just as silly as the former was.

&gt;&gt; The TRUE SECT believes the Great Bard
&gt;&gt; was born into a house of illiterates in a tiny
&gt;&gt; provincial town (with 210 houses), stayed
&gt;&gt; there, marrying at 18 and having three kids
&gt;&gt; by the time he was 21 . . . but somehow got
&gt;&gt; to London in his mid or late 20s and then
&gt;&gt; STARTED a literary career . . . from which
&gt;&gt; he retired at the 'elderly' age of his mid-
&gt;&gt; forties, forgetting in the meantime, to make
&gt;&gt; sure that his children learnt to read.

&gt; That's not quite what the books I've read say about William
&gt; Shakespeare. You can't just pull individual facts out of entire
&gt; books, and make up your own argument with them.

Well, what do the books you've read say about William Shakespeare, Bianca?

I have no case regarding the Authorship. It's still an open question -

The original poster, Bianca, asked me for an example of what I meant by

Buffalo,

One assumes that since you have read several Oxfordian books, you have also
read traditional accounts. Is there no &quot;lunacy&quot; in them? Do you find
everything written about Shakespeare of Stratford reasonable? Or are the
books of traditionalists also tainted?

I think you're dead on about Shakespeare of Stratford, apart from the bit
that goes &quot;he turned out to be the best playwright around, and took
advantage of that opportunity.&quot; There appears to be nothing earlier in your
description that would account for his brilliance. How do you explain it?
You should be able to do so with ease, as you feel the Baconians and now the
Oxfordians are extremely silly. No doubt you've read the books on these
candidates and dismissed them because you have a better explanation.

And by the way, Shakespeare, whoever he was, wasn't just the best playwright
around. He was for All Time. How do you explain that?

Stratfordian books frequently resort to Polyfilla to plug the gaps. Too much
inferential scholarship. &quot;We need have no doubt that&quot;, &quot;It is unquestionably
the case that&quot;, &quot;It would be reasonable to suppose&quot;, etc, doing service for
hard evidence. That's a very different thing from lunacy. Of course,
Stratfordians cover a much larger spectrum than Oxfordians (there are many
more of them: it's a bigger database) so of course you can find lunatic
theories there too - Chalmers being the outstanding case, with Charlotte
Stopes coming a close second. But those writers do not carry much weight
with other Strats. The closest we have to a lunatic amongst modern
Stratfordian scholars is A.L. Rowse.

Oxfordian writers are not necessarily lunatic either, even when they reach
for the Polyfilla, which they do at least as often as Stratfordians. For
example, I do not find Joseph Sobran's arguments very convincing, but I
could never call them lunatic. The idea of Sir Edward Alleyn as the Upstart
Crow is not one that will win many converts. But it isn't a lunatic theory.
Sobran does at least score one point: Alleyn is an actor. It takes Ogburn to
score nil. His Upstart Crow, the Earl of Southampton, isn't *even* an actor
(never mind a Johannes Factotum, etc). It's also a lunatic theory that
depends upon another lunatic theory, one Ogburn borrowed from his parents,
Charlton Sr and Dorothy Ogburn - namely, that Southampton was the
illegitimate son of Oxford and Queen Elizabeth.

I should say also that the idea of Oxford as Shakespeare is not in itself a
lunatic idea, even though I cannot find a lot in its favour.

Of course I often feel that in reverse. David, why not come to our website

no opinions about the question, except of the most oblique kind. As she

came here to ask a question about it, not to express an opinion, or to make

Why should there be? Can you find anything in Dickens's early life that
accounts for his brilliance? He was taken out of school at age 12 and put to
work in a blacking factory. Not much promise in that, is there? What do you
expect to find in Shakespeare's early life - a visit from the Angel Gabriel?
I myself can find nothing in the life of either Oxford or William that
points at the later Shakespeare - because I do not know what counts as a

His brilliance is &quot;kind of ordinary&quot;? Do you think if it was really ordinary

I can't speak for Mr. Crowley, but I've certainly made no such claim. (by
the way, you're the first person ever to lump me together with Mr. Crowley).
I don't believe the case has anything to do with upper or lower classes. Ben
Jonson, after all, was a commoner, and none of us are disputing his
authorship of his works. On the contrary, the case has to do with whether
*Shakespeare himself* had the temperament and education necessary to write
the canon.

If you'd like to see more about why I believe the Earl of Oxford wrote the
works, please visit our website at  . There's
plenty of information there to get you started. In the meantime, I have no
objection to your knowing nothing about the Oxfordians, as long as you don't
call us silly out of ignorance. When you've learned about us, if you still
feel the need to, you may indeed call us silly. Bob and Tom and Neil and
others here do so all the time. But they've done some reading about
authorship so I'm happy for them to do so (even if they're wrong, which they
are). ;)

That's a good question, Tom, and my answer would be that one must have
brilliance to be the kind of writer that Dickens was, and thousands didn't
have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my statement that
his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so it is easy
to see that he wrote the books attributed to him. In some cases, as with
_David Copperfield_, his work was close to autobiographical. The problem
with Shakespeare of Stratford is that however brilliant he may have been
(and of course we have no evidence whatsoever of his having any kind of
brilliance except perhaps business acumen), imo there is no correspondence
between his life and the canon.

Love,
Lynne

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Well, what do the books you've read say about William Shakespeare, Bianca?

&gt; I believe, that he was from an average family in an average town in an
&gt; average region of southern England; that he fooled around a bit and
&gt; had to get married; that he got to London at a time of great ferment,
&gt; something like (in what I admit is a bad analogy) Greenwich Village in
&gt; the 1960s and early 1970s; that there was an opportunity at the time
&gt; for people who could do something original, in the theatre and in
&gt; English poetry; and that he turned out to be the best playwright
&gt; around, and took advantage of that opportunity. And lots of artists
&gt; settle down when they hit middle age.

&gt; I don't remember what all my sources have been, though, unfortunately.
&gt; Probably the standard ones.

"/>

Yep. That's the standard story -- pretty much.

What is amazing is that so many seem to be
fairly happy with it. I suppose it's warm and
cosy. Any ordinary normal jerk can turn into
the next Shakespeare. All he or she needs is
a bit of luck -- and that magic pen.

Do you think someone could win it on the
lottery?

Pepys diary: November 7th. 1667

Up, and at the office hard all the morning, and at noon resolved
with Sir W. Pen to go see &quot;The Tempest,&quot; an old play of Shakespeare's,
acted, I hear, the first day; and so my wife, and girl, and W. Hewer
by themselves, and Sir W. Pen and I afterwards by ourselves; and
forced to sit in the side balcone over against the musique-room at
the Duke's house, close by my Lady Dorset and a great many great ones.
The house mighty full; the King and Court there and

the most INNOCENT play that EVER I saw;

and a curious piece of musique in an ECHO of half sentences,
the ECHO repeating the former half,
while the man goes on to the latter; which is mighty pretty.

The play [has] no great wit, but yet good, above ordinary plays.

Of course it had something to do with class.
A very great deal. Everything in England
has a lot to do with class -- and this much
more than most.

First he had great genetic inheritance.
I don't know what that counts for -- but,
if it counts for anything, he had it.

Second, he had the best conceivable
education. He was taught by the top
minds of his day. That is very important,
not just in itself, but in the confidence it
gave him. He knew what was the absolute
best that was around, and he found that
not merely could he match it, he could
outdo it.

Third, he had access to all the books
and materials he wanted. Nothing was
stinted to him.

Fourth, his father (and his grandfather
before him) had their own company of
players in their own house, to entertain
them in the winter months. This lad
was virtually born into the theatre.

Fifth, he was not restrained by the kind
of middle-class small-mindedness most
of us have suffered in growing up. He
asked questions from his earliest days,
and he got true and honest answers.
Nothing was concealed, nor held back
from him. He was never told 'that's dirty
-- nice people don't talk about such
things&quot;.

So he knew the 'facts of life' from as soon
as he could grasp them. That whole
attitude meant that his enormous talent
was able to develop without restraint from
the time he was very young -- as it had to,
if he was to turn into such a genius.

Sixth, he was born at the perfect time.
He spent his first nine years or so in the
great family castle in Essex, His parents
and their set of Cambridge 'intellectuals'
were in a kind of exile from the court
during Mary's reign. So he got plenty
of the best kind of attention.

He was nearly nine years old when
Elizabeth I came to the throne. His
family were right at the heart of the
new 'ruling party'; his mother was a
Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen. So he
experienced the glorious early years of
her reign. The Queen herself saw his
great talent and gave it her personal
protection for the rest of her life.

I would say that the appearance of genius in the middle class (often
without benefit of the elite educational opportunities that so many
Oxfordians seem to regard as obligatory for its development) is &quot;kind of
ordinary&quot; among geniuses. It is no easier to account for Newton or
Gauss or Bach or Grothendieck than for Shakespeare, yet nobody seems to
doubt that Bach wrote the prodigious amount of unsurpassed organ,
choral, and instrumental music attributed to him (with a couple dozen
kids underfoot) or that Newton really did discover some stunningly
general and powerful laws of nature despite his extremely vindictive
personality or that Gauss proved the Therorem Egregium. There is no
accounting for genius, and among the small sample space of geniuses, it
arises routinely in places that persons unfamiliar with its history find
implausible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But Lynne -- most Oxfordians *are* silly out of ignorance, although

I also find it difficult to believe that seemingly intelligent people would
look at Shakespeare of Stratford, at his (possible) dubious education, at
his obsession with trade and money, at his illiterate daughters (or at
least, his one definitely illiterate daughter; the other could sign her
name); at his wavering signatures; at his lack of a paper trail; at his
absence of connection to Southampton, to whom the narrative poems are
dedicated; at his total ignorance of the courtly mores that are displayed
over and over in the works; and still believe that he wrote the canon.

Dickens has been brought up today in discussion. Examining his life and
novels provides even more evidence that the experience of an author is
almost certainly mirrored *in some way* in his body of work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dickens died at Gad's Hill Place on JUNE 9, 1870
exactly 5 years after his train accident on JUNE 9, 1865.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In his will Dickens had directed 'that my name be inscribed in plain
English letters on my tomb. I rest my claims to the remembrance of my
country upon my published works and to the remembrance of my friends
upon their experience of me.' Towards evening, Percy Fitzgerald joined
the growing throng and recorded 'There was a wreath of white roses
lying on the flags at his feet, a great bank of ferns at his head, rows of
white and red roses down the sides.' With Forster's permission,
Dean Stanley allowed the grave to remain open for two more days.

At dusk on 16 June (Thursday), after the Abbey closed to the public,
Lord Houghton heard that the grave would not be closed until
MIDNIGHT. He was the last to look on the coffin.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;apart from the bit that

advantage
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that opportunity.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, well.

&gt;&gt; Excellent argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There appears to be nothing earlier in your description
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that would account for his brilliance. How do you explain it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you think it needs an explanation? It's kind of ordinary.

&gt;&gt; His brilliance is &quot;kind of ordinary&quot;? Do you think if it was really
ordinary
&gt;&gt; we would still be discussing the works 400 years later? Or have I
&gt;&gt; misunderstood you?

&gt; I would say that the appearance of genius in the middle class (often
&gt; without benefit of the elite educational opportunities that so many
&gt; Oxfordians seem to regard as obligatory for its development) is &quot;kind of
&gt; ordinary&quot; among geniuses. It is no easier to account for Newton or
&gt; Gauss or Bach or Grothendieck than for Shakespeare, yet nobody seems to
&gt; doubt that Bach wrote the prodigious amount of unsurpassed organ,
&gt; choral, and instrumental music attributed to him (with a couple dozen
&gt; kids underfoot) or that Newton really did discover some stunningly
&gt; general and powerful laws of nature despite his extremely vindictive
&gt; personality or that Gauss proved the Therorem Egregium. There is no
&gt; accounting for genius, and among the small sample space of geniuses, it
&gt; arises routinely in places that persons unfamiliar with its history find

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; All I've heard so

&gt;&gt;&gt; seen nothing at all concerning what kind of scholarship is supposed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; support the &quot;Oxfordian&quot; case. You and Mr. Crowley, taken together,
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be implying that the case comes down to something like &quot;a
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater probability of talent in the upper classes than in the lower.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I can't speak for Mr. Crowley,

&gt; Don't feel too bad, Lynne -- nobody can. Mr. Crowley's delusions are
&gt; one of a kind, and they surpass in eccentricity anything even a gifted
&gt; parodist could invent.

&gt;&gt; but I've certainly made no such claim. (by
&gt;&gt; the way, you're the first person ever to lump me together with Mr.
Crowley).
&gt;&gt; I don't believe the case has anything to do with upper or lower classes.
Ben
&gt;&gt; Jonson, after all, was a commoner, and none of us are disputing his
&gt;&gt; authorship of his works. On the contrary, the case has to do with
whether
&gt;&gt; *Shakespeare himself* had the temperament and education necessary to
write
&gt;&gt; the canon.

&gt;&gt; If you'd like to see more about why I believe the Earl of Oxford wrote
the
&gt;&gt; works, please visit our website at  www.shakespearefellowship.org .
There's
&gt;&gt; plenty of information there to get you started. In the meantime, I have
no
&gt;&gt; objection to your knowing nothing about the Oxfordians, as long as you
don't
&gt;&gt; call us silly out of ignorance.

&gt; But Lynne -- most Oxfordians *are* silly out of ignorance, although
&gt; many are silly for other reasons as well: an inability to read English,

they
&gt;&gt; are). ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No doubt you've read the books on these candidates and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dismissed them because you have a better explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'd &quot;read the books on&quot; Oxford as a &quot;candidate,&quot; I wouldn't have

I find it strange that anti-strats can accept that, in the previous

A bit of circular logic. You know nothing about his interests and his
character except from his books, and from books written about him. You infer
the persona from this material and project it backwards in time, because you
are safe in assuming that Dickens is the true author. If you had no more
documentary evidence for Dickens than you had for Shakespeare, you would
know nothing about him either, and would have to ask how someone whose
schooling ended at age 12 came to write works of genius. The next step,
inevitably, would be proposing that Lord Verisopht wrote them, using
Dickens as a front-man. There is nothing in Dickens's early life that
indicates a nascent genius. He's just lucky that the documentary evidence in
his favour is incontrovertible.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why weren't there a thousand Dickenses?

&gt;&gt; That's a good question, Tom, and my answer would be that one must have
&gt;&gt; brilliance to be the kind of writer that Dickens was, and thousands
didn't
&gt;&gt; have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my statement
that
&gt;&gt; his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so it is
&gt; easy
&gt;&gt; to see that he wrote the books attributed to him.

&gt; A bit of circular logic. You know nothing about his interests and his
&gt; character except from his books, and from books written about him. You
infer
&gt; the persona from this material and project it backwards in time, because
you
&gt; are safe in assuming that Dickens is the true author. If you had no more
&gt; documentary evidence for Dickens than you had for Shakespeare, you would
&gt; know nothing about him either, and would have to ask how someone whose
&gt; schooling ended at age 12 came to write works of genius. The next step,
&gt; inevitably, would be proposing that Lord Verisopht wrote them, using
&gt; Dickens as a front-man. There is nothing in Dickens's early life that
&gt; indicates a nascent genius. He's just lucky that the documentary evidence
in
&gt; his favour is incontrovertible.

Even Lynne's argument regarding autobiography in the works is weak, since
she needs to pick and choose from the Dickens canon to support her point. Or
does she consider &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; autobiographical? Perhaps in the
Pickwickian sense....

advantage

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, well.

&gt;&gt; Excellent argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There appears to be nothing earlier in your description
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that would account for his brilliance. How do you explain it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you think it needs an explanation? It's kind of ordinary.

&gt;&gt; His brilliance is &quot;kind of ordinary&quot;? Do you think if it was really
ordinary
&gt;&gt; we would still be discussing the works 400 years later? Or have I
&gt;&gt; misunderstood you?

&gt; I would say that the appearance of genius in the middle class (often
&gt; without benefit of the elite educational opportunities that so many
&gt; Oxfordians seem to regard as obligatory for its development) is &quot;kind of
&gt; ordinary&quot; among geniuses. It is no easier to account for Newton or
&gt; Gauss or Bach or Grothendieck than for Shakespeare, yet nobody seems to
&gt; doubt that Bach wrote the prodigious amount of unsurpassed organ,
&gt; choral, and instrumental music attributed to him (with a couple dozen
&gt; kids underfoot) or that Newton really did discover some stunningly
&gt; general and powerful laws of nature despite his extremely vindictive
&gt; personality or that Gauss proved the Therorem Egregium. There is no
&gt; accounting for genius, and among the small sample space of geniuses, it
&gt; arises routinely in places that persons unfamiliar with its history find
&gt; implausible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Do you mean the explanation is &quot;kind of ordinary&quot;? In

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should be

&gt;&gt; Oxfordians are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremely silly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I still know almost nothing about &quot;the Oxfordians.&quot;

&gt; Her state is the more blessed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All I've heard so
&gt;&gt;&gt; far is that some who practice biographical criticism find the Earl of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's biography more congenial than William Shakespeare's. I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen nothing at all concerning what kind of scholarship is supposed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; support the &quot;Oxfordian&quot; case. You and Mr. Crowley, taken together,
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be implying that the case comes down to something like &quot;a
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater probability of talent in the upper classes than in the lower.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I can't speak for Mr. Crowley,

&gt; Don't feel too bad, Lynne -- nobody can. Mr. Crowley's delusions are
&gt; one of a kind, and they surpass in eccentricity anything even a gifted

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; but I've certainly made no such claim. (by
&gt;&gt; the way, you're the first person ever to lump me together with Mr.
Crowley).
&gt;&gt; I don't believe the case has anything to do with upper or lower classes.
Ben
&gt;&gt; Jonson, after all, was a commoner, and none of us are disputing his
&gt;&gt; authorship of his works. On the contrary, the case has to do with
whether
&gt;&gt; *Shakespeare himself* had the temperament and education necessary to
write
&gt;&gt; the canon.

&gt;&gt; If you'd like to see more about why I believe the Earl of Oxford wrote
the
&gt;&gt; works, please visit our website at  www.shakespearefellowship.org .
There's
&gt;&gt; plenty of information there to get you started. In the meantime, I have
no
&gt;&gt; objection to your knowing nothing about the Oxfordians, as long as you
don't
&gt;&gt; call us silly out of ignorance.

&gt; But Lynne -- most Oxfordians *are* silly out of ignorance, although
&gt; many are silly for other reasons as well: an inability to read English,
&gt; an inability to reason, an inability to use a library, etc. There may
&gt; be a VERy few Oxfordians who are not ignorant and hence ought to know
&gt; better, but I won't even attempt to account for their silliness. Just
&gt; as there is no accounting for genius, so there is no accounting for
&gt; folly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; When you've learned about us, if you still

&gt;&gt; authorship so I'm happy for them to do so (even if they're wrong, which
they
&gt;&gt; are). ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No doubt you've read the books on these candidates and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dismissed them because you have a better explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'd &quot;read the books on&quot; Oxford as a &quot;candidate,&quot; I wouldn't have
&gt;&gt;&gt; asked what the deal was with the &quot;Oxford case.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If you haven't read them, how can you make the assumption that we're
silly?

&gt; An inspired guess? And right on the mark!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And by the way, Shakespeare, whoever he was, wasn't just the best
&gt;&gt; playwright
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around. He was for All Time. How do you explain that?

Tom:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why weren't there a thousand Dickenses?

Or ten thousand for that matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------
King Henry VI, Part ii Act 4, Scene 10

CADE: Let ten thousand DEVILS come against me,

The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 1, Scene 3

PISTOL: As many DEVILS entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.

King Henry V Act 2, Scene 3

Boy: Yes, that a' did; and said they were DEVILS incarnate.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Love's Labour's Lost Act 4, Scene 3

BIRON: DEVILS soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;It was a strange figure -- like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were VERy long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white, and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.

Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the VERy wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as EVER.&gt;&gt;

There is NO RECORD WHATEVER of
Jesus having slipped down into the Sea of Galilee
and drowned when he stepped out upon it:
(Surely one of his friends would have noticed!)
---------------------------------------------------------
water.htm

&lt;&lt;[Jesus] was the eschatological battle against the cosmic enemy,
the chaos monster characterized by the sea.

John 6:14-21 (from The Message Translation)
The people realized that God was at work among them in what Jesus
had just done. They said, &quot;This is the Prophet for sure, God's Prophet
right here in Galilee!&quot; Jesus saw that in their enthusiasm, they were
about to grab him and make him king, so he slipped off and
went back up the mountain to be by himself.
In the evening his disciples went down to the sea, got in the boat, and
headed back across the water to Capernaum. It had grown quite dark and
Jesus had not yet returned. A huge wind blew up, churning the sea.
They were maybe three or four miles out when they saw Jesus walking
on the sea, quite near the boat. They were scared senseless,
but he reassured them, &quot;It's me. It's all right. Don't be afraid.&quot;
So they took him on board. In no time they reached land
on the exact spot they were headed to.

The story of Jesus walking on water is also found
in Matthew 14: 22-33, and Mark 6:45-52.

John 6:19 (quoted above) uses the Greek wording
similar to the Greek version (the Septuagint) of Job 9:8

Job 9:8 (NIV): He alone stretched out the heavens
and treads on the waves of the Sea (Yamm);

In the original Hebrew the word for sea is Yamm,
who is the evil sea god in ancient Canaan myth.
For the Hebrew people Yamm is the chaos monster.

The education of women was widespread in private rather than in public
education.

It was never thought that women should be seen as teachers - to the extent
that they could not appear to be so, yet of all private teachers of the
English language, women occupied a perhaps dis-avowable majority. Even
priests wrote in retrospect of their female teachers!

The education of medieval children was always thus, extending through the
Jacobean period.

No of course not, Tom. But I imagine that these authors are discoverable in
their work in other ways. I never lived in Acadia, or in France during the
second world war, or during the Irish Famine, but if you know me you can
discover bits of my biography and philosophy in my teen books. It is
impossible not to be in one's books in some way, whether it has to do with
the story, or the philosophy within it, or the way of telling it, or
idiosyncratic quirks of language. That's why one can't point to novels such
as _A Tale of Two Cities_ by Dickens and say, &quot;See, it reveals nothing about
him.It could be by anybody.&quot; Although a historical novel, it positively
reeks of Dickens--the language, the philosophy, the imprisonment, the
development of the plot, the romantic portrayal of Lucy Manette, etc., all
point back to him as the author.

I suspect most writers of fiction would agree with me. John Irving's novel
_A Widow for One Year_ concerns an author who believes she is not present in
her novels, but is shown to be so--a murder is solved because of what she
has written. Carol Shield's _Unless_ is very autobiographical, in the sense
that it is about a writer writing about another writer, and the protagonist
actually ruminates in the book about how writers tend to write about
themselves though they sometimes disguise it. These are just two books I've
read recently. Authors write about what they know (in a deep sense--this
doesn't mean they can't go and research something).

We cannot help but reveal ourselves, even if we make a concerted effort not
to do so. Our education (or lack of it) is on display, as are our interests,
our sensitivities and sometimes our biographies.

You can say, &quot;But what about so and so?&quot; and of course there are always the
lone exceptions that prove the rule, but I'd still say if one looked closely
enough, one would see a parallel, even if it were just between certain
phrases used in letters or speech and in the works.

The problem with William Shakespeare of Stratford, to my mind, is that there
is no such parallel. The more we learn about him from documents, the further
it takes him from the works. This has always been a problem for me. When I
taught, I more or less omitted the biography because it didn't hang together
with the works and I felt uneasy about it. I was not an Oxfordian at the
time. I was just puzzled.

Best wishes,
Lynne

My guess it would be a priority for a playwright who depicted women such as
Portia. Shakespeare's women are, on the whole, intelligent and well
educated. Even if they're not educated (such as with Perdita) a quality
shines through which shows them to be of the aristocracy.

There is a very *familiar* undercurrent in the dedication to V and A. It

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Excellent argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There appears to be nothing earlier in your description

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you think it needs an explanation? It's kind of ordinary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; His brilliance is &quot;kind of ordinary&quot;? Do you think if it was really
&gt; ordinary
&gt;&gt;&gt; we would still be discussing the works 400 years later? Or have I
&gt;&gt;&gt; misunderstood you?

&gt;&gt; I would say that the appearance of genius in the middle class (often
&gt;&gt; without benefit of the elite educational opportunities that so many
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians seem to regard as obligatory for its development) is &quot;kind of
&gt;&gt; ordinary&quot; among geniuses. It is no easier to account for Newton or
&gt;&gt; Gauss or Bach or Grothendieck than for Shakespeare, yet nobody seems to
&gt;&gt; doubt that Bach wrote the prodigious amount of unsurpassed organ,
&gt;&gt; choral, and instrumental music attributed to him (with a couple dozen
&gt;&gt; kids underfoot) or that Newton really did discover some stunningly
&gt;&gt; general and powerful laws of nature despite his extremely vindictive
&gt;&gt; personality or that Gauss proved the Therorem Egregium. There is no
&gt;&gt; accounting for genius, and among the small sample space of geniuses, it
&gt;&gt; arises routinely in places that persons unfamiliar with its history find
&gt;&gt; implausible.

&gt; Other geniuses with unpleasant backgrounds include the antisemetic and
&gt; adulterous Richard Wagner, the drunken antisemitic Alexander Alekhine, the

Anti-semitic is not uneducated. Nor is an unpleasant background a bar to

But we are not talking about what was typical in a general sense, Phil.
Typically the heads of most households were illiterate during the period
anyhow. We are talking about what was typical in aristocratic houses of the
time and more specifically, what went on in Oxford's home. It was certainly
not typical for an aristocratic father to either teach his son or have very
much to do with him in a domestic sense. Oxford's tutors are pretty well
documented, in any case; they were some of the most learned scholars in the
land; he may also have been &quot;tutored&quot; by his uncle (on his mother's side)
Arthur Golding, the translator of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, a work which had a
profound influence on Shakespeare's works.

I'd like to clarify something. When I said the fact that we believe Oxford
wrote the works had nothing to do with class, I meant that genius does not
arise from the nobility alone, and so we do not pick Oxford as our prime
candidate merely because he was a member of the aristocracy. Accusations of
snobbery have been levelled against Oxfordians, and those accusations are
ridiculous.

The question does have something to do with class in the sense that
Shakespeare's writing (to me at least) reveals evidence of an incredibly
good education, the kind of education available to Oxford, coupled with an
abiding interest in and knowledge of the concerns of the nobility. So in
many ways, Paul and I are in agreement on this. Our differences are mainly
semantic--at least I think so. Paul may not.

O - I wonder to what extent this is true? Perhaps opinions vary? I was
quoting from a title of a bloke from Exeter U, one Dr. Nicholas Orme, in his
title Medieval Children.

There is a cusp and a variety of experimentation between Elizabethan and
Jacobean attitudes and habits [not unrelated to 'church' issues]. Orme makes
some distinctions to the extent of such churchified education; most readers
and hornbooks for example followed a religious theme.

I think as a generality this is true, and is only countermanded by
exceptions. Rimbaud of course for his poetry, but late in his life he was a
formidable linguist, as a result of study and also immersion.

Even Waugh didn't complete his time at Oxford, and thought it all an
unconscionable waste of time and mostly rote-learned nonsense.

LOL - I was thinking this morning over the use of common internet terms - of
Mr. Zenner's use of collation, and such things, and that word 'semantics'.
Over time it has had all sorts of meanings including, in the cognitive
psychological discipline, where it means &quot;meaning&quot;.

There was an area of study called 'general semantics' which we might these
days call semiology. That usage was in widespread use in the 1950s and 60s,
and indeed a sci-fi writer A.E. Van Vogt wrote some philosophical novels
exploring word-label contrasted to perception of actual items, also
suggesting what a Baconian might approve, Aristotlian and non-Aristotlian
thought, abbreviated to &quot;Null-A&quot;. (from memory I think one title was &quot;The
Pawns of Null-A)

Apprehension of this word in common net usage is to say of differences 'it
is only semantics', using it as an [negative] attribution to a specific
phrase. Whereas the statement is equivalent to saying that 'it is only
meaning' that is at stake.

Of course, use is master, and the language belongs to its speakers: the
trouble with these appropriations is that the original sense is left
orphaned, with no label or parent word for it. This is unfortunate for our
language, especially when half a dozen terms already existed for the 'new'
meaning.

That was a very soft rant, wasn't it :)

Let's see. A writer writes a book about a writer writing about a writer, and
in it the lead ruminates that writers tend to write about themselves though
they sometimes disguise it. That proves Shakespeare could not have written
the works! It had to be Oxford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Caroline Spurgeon, author of &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us,&quot;
agrees with you. She analyzed the images used by Shakespeare, and she went
further and did the same analysis on other Elizabethan authors, including
Marlowe, Jonson, Chapman, Dekker and Massinger. (Shakespeare would have been
enough for antiStratfordian &quot;scholars.&quot;)

She writes &quot;...we are justified, I suggest, in assuming that a poet will, in
the long run, naturally tend to draw the large proportion of his images from
the objects he knows best, or thinks most about, or from incidents, among
myriads he has experienced, to which he is sensitive, and which therefore
remain within his knowledge.&quot; She also says, &quot;In the case of a poet, I
suggest it is chiefly through his images that he, to some extent
unconsciously, 'gives himself away'.&quot;

She attempted to extract all the images used in Shakespeare's plays, and
classified them into different categories (ie. war, sport, money,
buildings). The results? She found 7342 images in the plays and poems which
she sorted into over 60 major categories.

The largest categories for Shakespeare were nature, animals and domestic or
everyday life.

Marlowe's images are predominently &quot;...drawn from books, especially the
classics, and from the sun, moon, planets and heavens far outnumber all
others.&quot;

The works of Shakespeare have been analyzed for hundreds of years, and it is
only antiStratfordians who find autobiographical elements in the subject
matter of the plays -- royalty, historical battles, etc. Imagine that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You can say, &quot;But what about so and so?&quot; and of course there are always

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but I'd still say if one looked closely
&gt; enough, one would see a parallel, even if it were just between certain
&gt; phrases used in letters or speech and in the works.

&gt; The problem with William Shakespeare of Stratford, to my mind, is that
there
&gt; is no such parallel. The more we learn about him from documents, the
further
&gt; it takes him from the works. This has always been a problem for me.

"/>

Nonsense. It is your comprehension that is at fault. There are many
Elizabethan middle class references in the works. It has been observed by
more than one critic that the royal households portrayed in the plays are
nothing more than thinly-disguised middle class families. And there are many
realistic portrayals of rural life.

When daisies pied and violets blue,
And lady-smocks all silver-white,
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo, cuckoo! -- O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo, cuckoo! -- O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

When icicles hang by the wall,
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail.
And Tom bears logs into the hall,
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,
To-whit!
To-who! -- a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow,
And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
And birds sit brooding in the snow,
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,
To-whit!
To-who! -- a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a good question, Tom, and my answer would be that one must
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brilliance to be the kind of writer that Dickens was, and thousands
&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my statement
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see that he wrote the books attributed to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A bit of circular logic. You know nothing about his interests and his
&gt;&gt;&gt; character except from his books, and from books written about him. You
&gt; infer
&gt;&gt;&gt; the persona from this material and project it backwards in time,
because
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are safe in assuming that Dickens is the true author. If you had no
more
&gt;&gt;&gt; documentary evidence for Dickens than you had for Shakespeare, you
would
&gt;&gt;&gt; know nothing about him either, and would have to ask how someone whose
&gt;&gt;&gt; schooling ended at age 12 came to write works of genius. The next
step,
&gt;&gt;&gt; inevitably, would be proposing that Lord Verisopht wrote them, using
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens as a front-man. There is nothing in Dickens's early life that
&gt;&gt;&gt; indicates a nascent genius. He's just lucky that the documentary
&gt; evidence in
&gt;&gt;&gt; his favour is incontrovertible.

believe these small elements of the rural are within the plays because of

Demonstrate to me how a style element can identify an autobiographical
event. Any stylistic element is subject to imitation. I can see how, say, a
plain style, such as Mark Twain's, might hint at his early career in
journalism, but there are many writers who use the style without ever having
worked for a newspaper. In the same way, stylistic quirks picked up at a
university could be imitated by someone who never saw the inside of a
schoolhouse.

Lighten up. It was an attempt at humor. At any rate, citing a fictional plot
in support of a theory of writing is pretty lame (but in the finest
antiStratfordian tradition, I admit). More to the point would be to show how
you could read a John Irving novel and give an account of his biography from
it without knowing anything about his life.

I gave three examples, not one,

&gt; however, it is rather fascinating that
&gt; Shields wrote about the propensity of writers to write about themselves in
&gt; different guises. One sees that in the majority of Canadian novels, at
&gt; least. Here I am rather counting on Mr. Irving to be Canadian, as he does
&gt; live in Toronto part of the year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; These are just two books I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; read recently. Authors write about what they know (in a deep
sense--this
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't mean they can't go and research something).

&gt;&gt; At least they're told to do that in writing class.

&gt; When I teach writing I always say: &quot;Write what you know or what you can
&gt; research.&quot; There are many different ways of researching, of course, and
the
&gt; rule doesn't necessarily hold for soft science fiction or fantasy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We cannot help but reveal ourselves, even if we make a concerted
effort
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do so. Our education (or lack of it) is on display, as are our
&gt;&gt; interests,
&gt;&gt;&gt; our sensitivities and sometimes our biographies.

&gt;&gt; Caroline Spurgeon, author of &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells
Us,&quot;
&gt;&gt; agrees with you. She analyzed the images used by Shakespeare, and she
went
&gt;&gt; further and did the same analysis on other Elizabethan authors,
including
&gt;&gt; Marlowe, Jonson, Chapman, Dekker and Massinger. (Shakespeare would have
&gt; been
&gt;&gt; enough for antiStratfordian &quot;scholars.&quot;)

&gt;&gt; She writes &quot;...we are justified, I suggest, in assuming that a poet
will,
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the long run, naturally tend to draw the large proportion of his images
&gt; from
&gt;&gt; the objects he knows best, or thinks most about, or from incidents,
among
&gt;&gt; myriads he has experienced, to which he is sensitive, and which
therefore
&gt;&gt; remain within his knowledge.&quot; She also says, &quot;In the case of a poet, I
&gt;&gt; suggest it is chiefly through his images that he, to some extent
&gt;&gt; unconsciously, 'gives himself away'.&quot;

&gt;&gt; She attempted to extract all the images used in Shakespeare's plays, and
&gt;&gt; classified them into different categories (ie. war, sport, money,
&gt;&gt; buildings). The results? She found 7342 images in the plays and poems
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; she sorted into over 60 major categories.

&gt;&gt; The largest categories for Shakespeare were nature, animals and domestic
&gt; or
&gt;&gt; everyday life.

&gt; I haven't read the book. The domestic or everyday life of what kind of
&gt; people? I imagine that would have something to do with the question at
hand.

&gt;&gt; Marlowe's images are predominently &quot;...drawn from books, especially the
&gt;&gt; classics, and from the sun, moon, planets and heavens far outnumber all
&gt;&gt; others.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The works of Shakespeare have been analyzed for hundreds of years, and
it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; only antiStratfordians who find autobiographical elements in the subject
&gt;&gt; matter of the plays -- royalty, historical battles, etc. Imagine that.

&gt; Yes, imagine. We are the only people who understand that the vast majority
&gt; of the plays are about the noble life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with William Shakespeare of Stratford, to my mind, is that
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no such parallel. The more we learn about him from documents, the
&gt;&gt; further
&gt;&gt;&gt; it takes him from the works. This has always been a problem for me.

&gt;&gt; Nonsense. It is your comprehension that is at fault. There are many
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan middle class references in the works. It has been observed
by
&gt;&gt; more than one critic that the royal households portrayed in the plays
are
&gt;&gt; nothing more than thinly-disguised middle class families.

&gt; It has, and I would say that those criticisms are erroneous, and simply
made

Well of course, the entire critical establishment exists primarily to
counter the antiStratfordian viewpoint.

Then the point must be that imagination is a very fine thing indeed. Without
it one is reduced to the pedestrian idea that Shakespeare (whose
characteristics I have delineated elsewhere) of Stratford was the best
dramatist the world has ever known.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that these authors are discoverable in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their work in other ways. I never lived in Acadia, or in France

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second world war, or during the Irish Famine, but if you know me you
&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discover bits of my biography and philosophy in my teen books. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible not to be in one's books in some way, whether it has to
do
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the story, or the philosophy within it, or the way of telling it, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idiosyncratic quirks of language. That's why one can't point to
novels
&gt;&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as _A Tale of Two Cities_ by Dickens and say, &quot;See, it reveals
nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him.It could be by anybody.&quot; Although a historical novel, it
&gt; positively
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reeks of Dickens--the language, the philosophy, the imprisonment,
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development of the plot, the romantic portrayal of Lucy Manette,
etc.,
&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point back to him as the author.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are mixing arguments here. Elements of style are not biographical.

&gt;&gt; 1) I had already gone on to say &quot;whether it has to do with
&gt;&gt; the story, or the philosophy within it, or the way of telling it, or
&gt;&gt; idiosyncratic quirks of language.&quot; I would think that includes elements
of
&gt;&gt; style.

&gt; And I pointed out that you are mixing arguments here. Elements of style
are
&gt; not biographical.

&gt;&gt; 2) I'm not altogether sure that elements of style are not at least
partly
&gt;&gt; biographical, in that we pick them up from our education, reading, and
&gt;&gt; experience.

&gt; So I assume the way I comb my hair is &quot;at least partly autobiographical,&quot;

You seem to want an explanation for the supposedly unusual fact, which
I do not believe to be unusual, that a man from an average family,
etc., had written brilliant works (in a genre, theatre, no less, that
is usually middle-class). There are many things that might require
explanation, but &quot;how being middle class could fail to prevent the
writing of brilliant plays&quot; is, in my opinion, not one of them. I am
still inclined to attribute your feeling that an explanation is
required to a belief about the statistical distribution of talent
within and between social groupings (class or otherwise). Or is there
some particular aspect of &quot;Shakespeare's brilliance,&quot; taken as a

&gt;&gt;&gt; You should be able to do so with ease, as you feel the Baconians

&gt;&gt; I still know almost nothing about &quot;the Oxfordians.&quot; All I've heard
so
&gt;&gt; far is that some who practice biographical criticism find the Earl
of
&gt;&gt; Oxford's biography more congenial than William Shakespeare's. I've
&gt;&gt; seen nothing at all concerning what kind of scholarship is supposed
to
&gt;&gt; support the &quot;Oxfordian&quot; case. You and Mr. Crowley, taken together,
&gt;&gt; seem to be implying that the case comes down to something like &quot;a
&gt;&gt; greater probability of talent in the upper classes than in the
lower.&quot;

&gt; I can't speak for Mr. Crowley, but I've certainly made no such claim. (by
&gt; the way, you're the first person ever to lump me together with Mr. Crowley).

"/>

I was under the impression that both you and Mr. Crowley support
Oxford as your &quot;candidate.&quot; Both you and Mr. Crowley appear to use
the same biographical data to challenge William Shakespeare's &quot;title&quot;
as author. Surely someone has referred to &quot;Oxfordians,&quot; including the
two of you, before me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't believe the case has anything to do with upper or lower classes. Ben
&gt; Jonson, after all, was a commoner, and none of us are disputing his
&gt; authorship of his works. On the contrary, the case has to do with whether
&gt; *Shakespeare himself* had the temperament and education necessary to write
&gt; the canon.

"/>

That's a concern appropriate to a hiring question. It's not a concern
appropriate to deciding whether you're going to doubt books that have
already been researched and written, as numerous volumes of
Shakespeare scholarship have already been. Perhaps my problem is with
the way the question seems to be formulated? I just can't understand
this emphasis on biography -- almost as a science, it seems to me,
with the latter parts of the life somehow being required to follow
logically from the initial parts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you'd like to see more about why I believe the Earl of Oxford wrote the
&gt; works, please visit our website at  www.shakespearefellowship.org . There's
&gt; plenty of information there to get you started. In the meantime, I have no
&gt; objection to your knowing nothing about the Oxfordians, as long as you don't
&gt; call us silly out of ignorance. When you've learned about us, if you still
&gt; feel the need to, you may indeed call us silly. Bob and Tom and Neil and
&gt; others here do so all the time. But they've done some reading about
&gt; authorship so I'm happy for them to do so (even if they're wrong, which they
&gt; are). ;)

"/>

Sorry, but given that this newsgroup is supposedly already filled with
people who have an interest in &quot;the question,&quot; and that nobody seems
able to tell me what the question _is_, or why anybody would be
interested in it, I don't see why I should want to spend any more time
on it. It's very natural that you would want to discuss your
interests only with those who already have the same interests. I wish
you might cut a little more slack for those who, like me, don't
measure up, but that's also, of course, your choice.

I remember now that I have read some of a book by Rowse, but not a
biography of Shakespeare. My knowledge of Shakespeare's biography has
come from here and there, including statements in textbooks to the
effect of, &quot;everything we have discovered about the man shows us that
he did write the plays attributed to him.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt you've read the books on these candidates and

&gt;&gt; If I'd &quot;read the books on&quot; Oxford as a &quot;candidate,&quot; I wouldn't have
&gt;&gt; asked what the deal was with the &quot;Oxford case.&quot;

&gt; If you haven't read them, how can you make the assumption that we're silly?

"/>

I &quot;assumed that those who support 'Oxford as Shakespeare' are as silly
as those who once supported 'Bacon as Shakespeare,'&quot; for the reason
that it's usually a safe bet that people who disbelieve certain
categories of common knowledge are silly, and because it's usually a
safe bet that two categories of people, both doing about the same
thing (that thing being unusual), are rather similar.

I certainly did not intend to insult you or your friends, and if
ignorance is generally taken as an insult, around these parts, I will
happily remain silent on the topic. I apologize if I did insult you,
or anybody else.

I might, though, say that you sound overly sensitive to charges of
being out of the mainstream. It may seem to you that you are well in
the mainstream, but if it seems to others that you're not, that is
quite simply a fact, and you have the choice either to demonize those

I really don't quite know what the &quot;social forces&quot; argument is. It
sounds like it would be related to the poststructuralist or postmodern
idea that &quot;language speaks us,&quot; at least in terms of having
non-physical (let alone biological) &quot;things&quot; _do_ something or other.
Obviously, it must be related to &quot;anti-humanism,&quot; also common in
postmodernism.

I'm also confused by why you say, &quot;a structuralist approach,&quot; as I
thought postmodernism, one facet of which is poststructuralism,
considers itself to supplant structuralism (not much of which, other
than a little bit of Levi-Strauss, I'm familiar with).

Given this confusion, I'm not sure my general idea of what you're
saying in the rest of the sentence can be correct, so maybe I'd better
stop there.

Someone who says, &quot;W.S. was born into an average family,&quot; is _not_
agreeing with, &quot;W.S. was born into a house of illiterates,&quot; even if
someone who says the latter provides the same footnote as someone who

You are focussing on a relatively trivial

The point is that we do not have the
beginnings of an understanding of the
nature of English Literature, nor of what it
is to be part of the culture it created, (nor
of who or what we are) when we cannot
answer simple questions as to how and
why it is the way it is, and how and why
it came into existence.

Having some illiterate clod-hopper as its

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You should be able to do so with ease, as you feel the Baconians

&gt;&gt;&gt; I still know almost nothing about &quot;the Oxfordians.&quot; All I've heard
&gt; so
&gt;&gt;&gt; far is that some who practice biographical criticism find the Earl
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's biography more congenial than William Shakespeare's. I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen nothing at all concerning what kind of scholarship is supposed
&gt; to

&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be implying that the case comes down to something like &quot;a
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater probability of talent in the upper classes than in the
&gt; lower.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I can't speak for Mr. Crowley, but I've certainly made no such claim. (by
&gt;&gt; the way, you're the first person ever to lump me together with Mr. Crowley).

&gt; I was under the impression that both you and Mr. Crowley support
&gt; Oxford as your &quot;candidate.&quot; Both you and Mr. Crowley appear to use
&gt; the same biographical data to challenge William Shakespeare's &quot;title&quot;
&gt; as author. Surely someone has referred to &quot;Oxfordians,&quot; including the
&gt; two of you, before me.

&gt;&gt; I don't believe the case has anything to do with upper or lower classes. Ben
&gt;&gt; Jonson, after all, was a commoner, and none of us are disputing his
&gt;&gt; authorship of his works. On the contrary, the case has to do with whether
&gt;&gt; *Shakespeare himself* had the temperament and education necessary to write
&gt;&gt; the canon.

&gt; That's a concern appropriate to a hiring question. It's not a concern
&gt; appropriate to deciding whether you're going to doubt books that have
&gt; already been researched and written, as numerous volumes of
&gt; Shakespeare scholarship have already been. Perhaps my problem is with
&gt; the way the question seems to be formulated? I just can't understand
&gt; this emphasis on biography -- almost as a science, it seems to me,
&gt; with the latter parts of the life somehow being required to follow
&gt; logically from the initial parts.

&gt;&gt; If you'd like to see more about why I believe the Earl of Oxford wrote the
&gt;&gt; works, please visit our website at  www.shakespearefellowship.org . There's
&gt;&gt; plenty of information there to get you started. In the meantime, I have no
&gt;&gt; objection to your knowing nothing about the Oxfordians, as long as you don't
&gt;&gt; call us silly out of ignorance. When you've learned about us, if you still
&gt;&gt; feel the need to, you may indeed call us silly. Bob and Tom and Neil and
&gt;&gt; others here do so all the time. But they've done some reading about
&gt;&gt; authorship so I'm happy for them to do so (even if they're wrong, which they
&gt;&gt; are). ;)

&gt; Sorry, but given that this newsgroup is supposedly already filled with
&gt; people who have an interest in &quot;the question,&quot; and that nobody seems
&gt; able to tell me what the question _is_, or why anybody would be
&gt; interested in it, I don't see why I should want to spend any more time
&gt; on it. It's very natural that you would want to discuss your
&gt; interests only with those who already have the same interests. I wish
&gt; you might cut a little more slack for those who, like me, don't
&gt; measure up, but that's also, of course, your choice.

&gt; I remember now that I have read some of a book by Rowse, but not a
&gt; biography of Shakespeare. My knowledge of Shakespeare's biography has
&gt; come from here and there, including statements in textbooks to the
&gt; effect of, &quot;everything we have discovered about the man shows us that
&gt; he did write the plays attributed to him.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt you've read the books on these candidates and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dismissed them because you have a better explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'd &quot;read the books on&quot; Oxford as a &quot;candidate,&quot; I wouldn't have
&gt;&gt;&gt; asked what the deal was with the &quot;Oxford case.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If you haven't read them, how can you make the assumption that we're silly?

&gt; I &quot;assumed that those who support 'Oxford as Shakespeare' are as silly
&gt; as those who once supported 'Bacon as Shakespeare,'&quot; for the reason
&gt; that it's usually a safe bet that people who disbelieve certain
&gt; categories of common knowledge are silly, and because it's usually a
&gt; safe bet that two categories of people, both doing about the same
&gt; thing (that thing being unusual), are rather similar.

&gt; I certainly did not intend to insult you or your friends, and if
&gt; ignorance is generally taken as an insult, around these parts, I will
&gt; happily remain silent on the topic. I apologize if I did insult you,
&gt; or anybody else.

&gt; I might, though, say that you sound overly sensitive to charges of
&gt; being out of the mainstream. It may seem to you that you are well in
&gt; the mainstream, but if it seems to others that you're not, that is
&gt; quite simply a fact, and you have the choice either to demonize those
&gt; others or to attempt to debate them. However, if the latter, you have
&gt; to consider that they have a right to think you are silly, on some
&gt; points.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And by the way, Shakespeare, whoever he was, wasn't just the best

&gt; I &quot;assumed that those who support 'Oxford as Shakespeare' are as silly

&gt; that it's usually a safe bet that people who disbelieve certain

I debate people all the time, and we mess around here and call each other

It's a weird world, the Crowleyverse, in which aristocrats with Van Dyck

seems to have mastered the difficult art of living inside a fantasy.

Peter G.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, he had the best conceivable
&gt;&gt;&gt; education. He was taught by the top
&gt;&gt;&gt; minds of his day. That is very important,
&gt;&gt;&gt; not just in itself, but in the confidence it
&gt;&gt;&gt; gave him. He knew what was the absolute
&gt;&gt;&gt; best that was around, and he found that
&gt;&gt;&gt; not merely could he match it, he could
&gt;&gt;&gt; outdo it.

&gt;&gt; I agree. But Marlowe and Jonson were great writers too, and they didn't
come
&gt;&gt; from the aristocratic classes. Therefore it was possible for someone of
the
&gt;&gt; middle class to succeed.

&gt; (a) 'Middle-class' is something of a misnomer
&gt; here. There are only the beginnings of such
&gt; a class. Tradesmen of the sort of Marlowe's
&gt; or the Stratman's fathers could hardly be
&gt; described so.
&gt; (b) We are not talking about mere 'success'
&gt; (c) Jonson was good, but far from great;
&gt; (d) Who was 'Marlowe'?

&gt;&gt; That's why I say it's not to do with class.

&gt; It's a silly statement. Everything in England
&gt; had (and has) to do with class. The clothes
&gt; you wore, the kind of language you spoke,
&gt; the words you used, the thoughts you had.
&gt; It is ahistorical nonsense to think that a
&gt; person of the Stratman's class could have
&gt; discussed concepts of kingship on the
&gt; public stage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fifth, he was not restrained by the kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of middle-class small-mindedness most
&gt;&gt;&gt; of us have suffered in growing up. He
&gt;&gt;&gt; asked questions from his earliest days,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and he got true and honest answers.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing was concealed, nor held back
&gt;&gt;&gt; from him. He was never told 'that's dirty
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- nice people don't talk about such
&gt;&gt;&gt; things&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Now you're into fairytale land. You have no idea.

&gt; Not so. This is a crucial issue, but too
&gt; involved to go into at the moment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sixth, he was born at the perfect time.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He spent his first nine years or so in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; great family castle in Essex, His parents
&gt;&gt;&gt; and their set of Cambridge 'intellectuals'
&gt;&gt;&gt; were in a kind of exile from the court
&gt;&gt;&gt; during Mary's reign. So he got plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the best kind of attention.

&gt;&gt; Paul, you must know that young aristocrats rarely had much contact with
&gt;&gt; their parents.

&gt; That's overstating the position. Usually
&gt; such parents were too busy with their
&gt; 'professional' lives to have a lot of time for
&gt; their kids. But since his Cambridge-oriented,
&gt; Protestant-inclined parents weren't doing
&gt; much during Mary's reign, we can assume
&gt; that there was more contact than usual.

&gt; Paul.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Demonstrate to me how a style element can identify an autobiographical
&gt;&gt;&gt; event. Any stylistic element is subject to imitation. I can see how,
&gt; say,
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; plain style, such as Mark Twain's, might hint at his early career in
&gt;&gt;&gt; journalism, but there are many writers who use the style without ever
&gt;&gt; having
&gt;&gt;&gt; worked for a newspaper. In the same way, stylistic quirks picked up at
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; university could be imitated by someone who never saw the inside of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; schoolhouse.

&gt;&gt; It's very hard to imitate a stylistic element if one can't read.
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's signatures suggest to me that he might not have been able
to
&gt;&gt; read very well.

&gt; I gather you're having trouble following the line of argument.

"/>

There's a line of argument? Anyhow, what can you expect from a mouse?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; At any rate, citing a fictional plot
&gt;&gt;&gt; in support of a theory of writing is pretty lame (but in the finest
&gt;&gt;&gt; antiStratfordian tradition, I admit). More to the point would be to
show
&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt; you could read a John Irving novel and give an account of his
biography
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; it without knowing anything about his life.

&gt;&gt; I would say Vermont, Vermont, Vermont, a bit of Toronto and Amsterdam,
and
&gt;&gt; bears, bears, bears. I'd also suggest that something terrible has
happened
&gt;&gt; very suddenly to him or someone near him. His books are bursting with
&gt;&gt; horrendous accidents that come, rather as in life, out of the blue. O
yes,
&gt;&gt; and I expect he likes apples. ;)

&gt; Now that sure narrows it down. The only thing I know about his life is
that
&gt; he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam War.

"/>

Maybe that's why he likes Canada. He certainly likes bears. They show up so
very often. Sometimes just a glimpse. Sometimes chapter upon chapter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I gave three examples, not one,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and they are merely that, examples;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fictional examples.

&gt;&gt; Of course fictional. They are from writers of fiction. That is the whole
&gt;&gt; point. Let the scholars argue as they may, it is the writers of fiction
&gt; who
&gt;&gt; in the main understand that one can't write a body of work without
putting
&gt;&gt; something of oneself into it.

&gt; Ah, those noble fictioneers with such a ethereal perspective of

&gt; You could say the same thing about a shoemaker. I know just as many hack

Ah, but I'm not talking about hacks. I'm talking about authors who write
with some degree of integrity. After all, don't you think that Shakespeare,
whoever he was, wrote with integrity? I can never accept the argument that
he penned the plays for plenteous pounds. ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, this particular rule is not rubbish, Tom. I defy you to write a
&gt;&gt; novel
&gt;&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a play which reveals nothing about yourself. Even your language or
&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; topic will likely give you away.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll e-mail you an old unpublished novel (mercifully short) and then
you
&gt;&gt;&gt; tell me my biography, OK? Or just tell me the biographical elements.

&gt;&gt; But I already know your biography, or at least some of it. And I'd need
&gt; more
&gt;&gt; than a fragment. I'd need a body of work as we have with Shakespeare.
And
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid that much though I like and respect you, I don't have time to
&gt;&gt; read your body of work at the moment.

&gt; I don't blame you a bit. I was just accepting your challenge.

Sorry for not being clearer. I think I was defending the

I took a class on &quot;Creativity&quot; once and we studied Levi-Strauss and

Not sure how different this is to Noam Chomsky's superficial and deep
structures. I would have to psych myself up for a while to get it all

Ok.
|
| &gt; | That's not quite what the books I've read say about William

| &gt;

a
| &gt; form of communication. He can argue that Shakespeare does this,
too.
| &gt; He could combine this with a mimetic approach, where he perhaps
uses

Your point sounds logical to me. Still, someone like Crowley might
continue by commenting that &quot;some nerd from an average family could
never be a polymath like Shakespeare, because &quot;average&quot; means dumbed

We have an example of the mark of one of his daughters. No one who could

&gt;&gt; What evidence is that, Neil? Excluding the canon, of course.

Look, Neil, I understand your point very well, but the fact is we are having
a discussion on who wrote the canon. If you wish to participate in the
discussion, you can't use the canon as evidence that he had certain kinds of

you can of course say whatever you want to.

Ben Jonson's ephemera survived very well. Shakespeare of S was on the scene

Again, Neil, you can't use this argument if we're debating who wrote the

to V and A is to my mind one of the strongest pieces of evidence that
Shakespeare of S did not write the canon. I've explained why elsewhere.

The testimony of the Folio is not really Shakespeare's own paper trail, but
I agree that if read without regard for possible ambiguity, it is one of the
two strongest pieces of evidence in your candidate's favour.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What connection is needed, Lynne?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a very *familiar* undercurrent in the dedication to V and
A.
&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matches the content of the work itself. Would a man who didn't know

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would a nobleman ask for patronage from another nobleman, Lynne?

&gt;&gt; He wasn't doing so. He was dedicating a work. He would certainly not
wish
&gt;&gt; for patronage from Southampton, not the monetary kind, anyhow. You are
&gt; stuck
&gt;&gt; on the idea that a dedication must of necessity be a plea for financial
&gt;&gt; compensation. It is possible that a nobleman would want an entirely
&gt;&gt; different kind of compensation from his equal.

&gt; Such as?

Sex? The message of the dedication is decidedly sexual. That's just a

&gt;&gt; Oxhead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So he was in court, Neil?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Well, he was in legal court, certainly. Perhaps that's where he gleaned
&gt; all
&gt;&gt; his legal knowledge.

&gt; I suppose the grant of cloth by King James was for something other than
&gt; court?

"/>

Hundreds of people received that same gift, Neil. He received it because he
was a player. Do you, like Michael Wood, imagine that a piece of red cloth
gave him access to the intrigues of the court? The fact that it was mere
cloth rather than something richer attests rather definitely to his position
in the pecking order.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And witness to the intrigues of the court?

&gt;&gt; Where is your evidence that he read or could read the sources, other

&gt; He was an actor. And why should I assume your silly rule that I cannot

Oxford's.

It's not a silly rule. It's a rule we have to adopt to have this discussion,
otherwise there's no point in having it. You can simply say, I know
Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays because he wrote the plays. His
name is on the title page. Case closed. I imagine, although I might be
wrong, that what we're discussing is that there is an authorship question
which suggests the name Shakespeare may have been a pseudonym. If you don't
accept that we're arguing with that as a possibility, there's little point
in continuing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where

&gt;&gt;&gt; Refresh my memory. Where is Cecil a role in the canon?

&gt;&gt; Many traditional and anti-Stratfordian critics have stated that Polonius
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; almost certainly a caricature of Burghley. The precepts, in particular,
&gt;&gt; identify him.

&gt; That isn't what I asked. And, even if it were true, it proves Oxford wrote
&gt; Shakespeare how?

"/>

It doesn't. It's just one of a myriad circumstantial pieces of evidence that
link him to the canon. Burghley was his guardian and father in law. It's
rather evidence that Shakespeare of Stratford didn't write the works
attributed to him. It's hard to know how he would have dared make fun of one
of the most poweful men in the kingdom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; How come?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, lest people think only the Oxfordians believe that
&gt; Polonius
&gt;&gt;&gt; was

&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this was the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but that doesn't mean it was accepted as such when it was first
&gt;&gt;&gt; performed.

&gt;&gt; I'm afraid it would have been much more obvious, especially as the name
in
&gt;&gt; the early quarto (Corambis, I believe) was a play on his motto, cor
unum,

Essentially you are trying to infer the totality of Shakespeare of
Stratford's attitudes and experience from a small number of business
and legal records. Since that &quot;totality&quot; doesn't include kings,
battles, revenge, filial ingratitude, young lovers and Italy, you
conclude that Will couldn't have been interested in those things. That
doesn't impress me as a very strong argument. It's a truism that no
one can or will write about subjects of which he has no knowledge and
in which he has no interest, but there are many sources of both
information and interest.

Even for writers who are much better documented than Shakespeare,
connecting personal experience to literary works is often impossible
for anybody but the author. What in the recorded facts about Kipling
explains his interest in and sympathy for rank-and-file soldiers in
the British Army (leaving aside the circular observation that his
expressions of sympathy and interest show that he was interested and
sympathetic)?

In Shakespeare's case, the range of his subject matter, character
types and geographical settings is the same as for other Elizabethan
playwrights, virtually all of whom came from middle class (or lower)
backgrounds. What sets the Bard apart is the brilliance of his
language, characterization and narration, not what he wrote about. If
the &quot;Stratford man&quot; lacked the background and experience to write his
works, then Marlowe, Jonson, Fletcher, Heywood, Greene, Dekker, Kyd et
al. couldn't have writer theirs either. Or are you going to convert to
the Brame/Popova thesis that Oxenford wrote *everything*?

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, there are many authors with well-documented lives whose
&gt;&gt; works do *not* reflect their biographies. P. G. Wodehouse didn't
&gt;&gt; cavort with the idle rich; Kipling never served in the army; Trollope
&gt;&gt; wasn't a country clergyman or a high-level politician; Patrick O'Brian
&gt;&gt; got all of his knowledge of the sea from libraries; and, of course, no
&gt;&gt; science fiction writer ever set foot on Mars.

&gt; No of course not, Tom. But I imagine that these authors are discoverable in
&gt; their work in other ways. I never lived in Acadia, or in France during the
&gt; second world war, or during the Irish Famine, but if you know me you can
&gt; discover bits of my biography and philosophy in my teen books. It is
&gt; impossible not to be in one's books in some way, whether it has to do with
&gt; the story, or the philosophy within it, or the way of telling it, or
&gt; idiosyncratic quirks of language. That's why one can't point to novels such
&gt; as _A Tale of Two Cities_ by Dickens and say, &quot;See, it reveals nothing about
&gt; him.It could be by anybody.&quot; Although a historical novel, it positively
&gt; reeks of Dickens--the language, the philosophy, the imprisonment, the
&gt; development of the plot, the romantic portrayal of Lucy Manette, etc., all
&gt; point back to him as the author.

&gt; I suspect most writers of fiction would agree with me. John Irving's novel
&gt; _A Widow for One Year_ concerns an author who believes she is not present in
&gt; her novels, but is shown to be so--a murder is solved because of what she
&gt; has written. Carol Shield's _Unless_ is very autobiographical, in the sense
&gt; that it is about a writer writing about another writer, and the protagonist
&gt; actually ruminates in the book about how writers tend to write about
&gt; themselves though they sometimes disguise it. These are just two books I've
&gt; read recently. Authors write about what they know (in a deep sense--this
&gt; doesn't mean they can't go and research something).

&gt; We cannot help but reveal ourselves, even if we make a concerted effort not
&gt; to do so. Our education (or lack of it) is on display, as are our interests,
&gt; our sensitivities and sometimes our biographies.

&gt; You can say, &quot;But what about so and so?&quot; and of course there are always the
&gt; lone exceptions that prove the rule, but I'd still say if one looked closely
&gt; enough, one would see a parallel, even if it were just between certain
&gt; phrases used in letters or speech and in the works.

&gt; The problem with William Shakespeare of Stratford, to my mind, is that there
&gt; is no such parallel. The more we learn about him from documents, the further
&gt; it takes him from the works. This has always been a problem for me. When I
&gt; taught, I more or less omitted the biography because it didn't hang together
&gt; with the works and I felt uneasy about it. I was not an Oxfordian at the
&gt; time. I was just puzzled.

&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why weren't there a thousand Dickenses?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a good question, Tom, and my answer would be that one must have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brilliance to be the kind of writer that Dickens was, and thousands
&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my statement
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so it
&gt; is
&gt; easy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see that he wrote the books attributed to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A bit of circular logic. You know nothing about his interests and his
&gt;&gt;&gt; character except from his books, and from books written about him. You
&gt; infer
&gt;&gt;&gt; the persona from this material and project it backwards in time, because
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are safe in assuming that Dickens is the true author. If you had no more
&gt;&gt;&gt; documentary evidence for Dickens than you had for Shakespeare, you would
&gt;&gt;&gt; know nothing about him either, and would have to ask how someone whose
&gt;&gt;&gt; schooling ended at age 12 came to write works of genius. The next step,
&gt;&gt;&gt; inevitably, would be proposing that Lord Verisopht wrote them, using
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens as a front-man. There is nothing in Dickens's early life that
&gt;&gt;&gt; indicates a nascent genius. He's just lucky that the documentary
&gt; evidence in
&gt;&gt;&gt; his favour is incontrovertible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What connection is needed, Lynne?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a very *familiar* undercurrent in the dedication to V and

&gt;&gt; It

commoner
&gt;&gt; dare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write such a dedication to an earl?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would a nobleman ask for patronage from another nobleman, Lynne?

&gt;&gt;&gt; He wasn't doing so. He was dedicating a work. He would certainly not
&gt; wish
&gt;&gt;&gt; for patronage from Southampton, not the monetary kind, anyhow. You are
&gt;&gt; stuck
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the idea that a dedication must of necessity be a plea for
financial
&gt;&gt;&gt; compensation. It is possible that a nobleman would want an entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt; different kind of compensation from his equal.

&gt;&gt; Such as?

&gt; Sex? The message of the dedication is decidedly sexual. That's just a
&gt; suggestion. I'm not entirely sure what he was after. But judging from the
&gt; dedication itself, it certainly wasn't money.

I believe we see who he was quite well from those records, which, thanks to
Michael Wood, have grown somewhat in number.

Since that &quot;totality&quot; doesn't include kings,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; one can or will write about subjects of which he has no knowledge and
&gt; in which he has no interest, but there are many sources of both
&gt; information and interest.

&gt; Even for writers who are much better documented than Shakespeare,
&gt; connecting personal experience to literary works is often impossible
&gt; for anybody but the author. What in the recorded facts about Kipling
&gt; explains his interest in and sympathy for rank-and-file soldiers in
&gt; the British Army (leaving aside the circular observation that his
&gt; expressions of sympathy and interest show that he was interested and
&gt; sympathetic)?

&gt; In Shakespeare's case, the range of his subject matter, character
&gt; types and geographical settings is the same as for other Elizabethan
&gt; playwrights, virtually all of whom came from middle class (or lower)
&gt; backgrounds. What sets the Bard apart is the brilliance of his
&gt; language, characterization and narration, not what he wrote about. If
&gt; the &quot;Stratford man&quot; lacked the background and experience to write his
&gt; works, then Marlowe, Jonson, Fletcher, Heywood, Greene, Dekker, Kyd et
&gt; al. couldn't have writer theirs either. Or are you going to convert to
&gt; the Brame/Popova thesis that Oxenford wrote *everything*?

"/>

Of course not, Tom. I had breakfast with Brame and Popova and told them I
didn't agree with them, charming though they are. I agreewith you that the
Bard's language, characterization and narration set him apart from the
others, but I would also add that evidence of his erudition sets him apart
from what we know of William Shakespeare of Stratford.

And there I should rest on this subject, although of course you may respond
if you wish, because I must have set a record with regard to posts yesterday
and the day before, and really do need to get on with some work.

Thank you for so kindly conversing with me. Politeness and thoughtfulness of

&gt; John Irving's novel
&gt; _A Widow for One Year_ concerns an author who believes she is not present in

&gt; that it is about a writer writing about another writer, and the protagonist
&gt; actually ruminates in the book about how writers tend to write about
&gt; themselves though they sometimes disguise it. These are just two books I've

&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my statement

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see that he wrote the books attributed to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A bit of circular logic. You know nothing about his interests and his
&gt;&gt;&gt; character except from his books, and from books written about him. You
&gt; infer
&gt;&gt;&gt; the persona from this material and project it backwards in time, because
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are safe in assuming that Dickens is the true author. If you had no more
&gt;&gt;&gt; documentary evidence for Dickens than you had for Shakespeare, you would
&gt;&gt;&gt; know nothing about him either, and would have to ask how someone whose
&gt;&gt;&gt; schooling ended at age 12 came to write works of genius. The next step,
&gt;&gt;&gt; inevitably, would be proposing that Lord Verisopht wrote them, using
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens as a front-man. There is nothing in Dickens's early life that
&gt;&gt;&gt; indicates a nascent genius. He's just lucky that the documentary
&gt; evidence in
&gt;&gt;&gt; his favour is incontrovertible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Demonstrate to me how a style element can identify an
autobiographical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; event. Any stylistic element is subject to imitation. I can see how,
&gt;&gt; say,
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plain style, such as Mark Twain's, might hint at his early career in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; journalism, but there are many writers who use the style without
ever
&gt;&gt;&gt; having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worked for a newspaper. In the same way, stylistic quirks picked up
at
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; university could be imitated by someone who never saw the inside of
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schoolhouse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's very hard to imitate a stylistic element if one can't read.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's signatures suggest to me that he might not have been
able
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; read very well.

&gt;&gt; I gather you're having trouble following the line of argument.

Here's a summary of our argument on this point:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; At any rate, citing a fictional plot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in support of a theory of writing is pretty lame (but in the finest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; antiStratfordian tradition, I admit). More to the point would be to
&gt; show
&gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you could read a John Irving novel and give an account of his
&gt; biography
&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it without knowing anything about his life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say Vermont, Vermont, Vermont, a bit of Toronto and Amsterdam,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; bears, bears, bears. I'd also suggest that something terrible has
&gt; happened
&gt;&gt;&gt; very suddenly to him or someone near him. His books are bursting with
&gt;&gt;&gt; horrendous accidents that come, rather as in life, out of the blue. O
&gt; yes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I expect he likes apples. ;)

&gt;&gt; Now that sure narrows it down. The only thing I know about his life is
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam War.

&gt; Maybe that's why he likes Canada. He certainly likes bears. They show up
so
&gt; very often. Sometimes just a glimpse. Sometimes chapter upon chapter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I gave three examples, not one,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and they are merely that, examples;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fictional examples.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course fictional. They are from writers of fiction. That is the
whole
&gt;&gt;&gt; point. Let the scholars argue as they may, it is the writers of
fiction
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the main understand that one can't write a body of work without
&gt; putting
&gt;&gt;&gt; something of oneself into it.

&gt;&gt; Ah, those noble fictioneers with such a ethereal perspective of
&gt; themselves!
&gt;&gt; You could say the same thing about a shoemaker. I know just as many hack
&gt;&gt; writers of fiction as I do writers of nonfiction.

&gt; Ah, but I'm not talking about hacks. I'm talking about authors who write

Oh, the antiStratfordian argument is nothing if not complex. It requires

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Demonstrate to me how a style element can identify an
&gt; autobiographical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; event. Any stylistic element is subject to imitation. I can see
how,
&gt;&gt;&gt; say,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plain style, such as Mark Twain's, might hint at his early career
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; journalism, but there are many writers who use the style without
&gt; ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worked for a newspaper. In the same way, stylistic quirks picked
up
&gt; at
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; university could be imitated by someone who never saw the inside
of
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schoolhouse.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's very hard to imitate a stylistic element if one can't read.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's signatures suggest to me that he might not have been
&gt; able
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read very well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I gather you're having trouble following the line of argument.

&gt;&gt; There's a line of argument?

&gt; Here's a summary of our argument on this point:

&gt; You: Stylistic elements are autobiographical.
&gt; Me: Oh yeah? Show me one. Stylistic elements can be imitated.
&gt; You: Shakespeare probably couldn't read.

Unfortunately I can't right now, Tom, because I don't have the book or film
at hand and I don't want to make a mistake. Remind me next time I go down to
Baltimore. There are certainly court records that Wood presented as new that
were to do with illegal (wool?) trade and I believe Shakespeare Sr. They
were very interesting because the sums involved were incredibly big for the
time.

&gt; didn't start out with the belief that William Shakespeare
&gt; couldn't (for whatever reason) have written the plays
&gt; attributed to him, and I still don't believe that, as it
&gt; happens.

May I ask, then, how you did come to those opinions, and what they
are?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do find it somewhat difficult to relate what we know
&gt; about Shakespeare's life to the competencies demonstrated
&gt; in the works, but still don't think it impossible for him
&gt; to have written them. I just think it far more likely he
&gt; had a *lot* of 'help' from elsewhere.

"/>

My immediate guess would be that he probably did have something like
&quot;help,&quot; but I don't know that this would really amount to &quot;help&quot; in
the usual sense. If his theatre company had some set of standard
plots and characters and situations and jokes, they would probably
have been developed over a long period of time, and improved by the
ideas of a lot of talented and experienced people during that time.
In addition to the known kinds of sources, like already existing
stories or plays or other kinds of books. In your opinion, what in
particular do you find difficult to relate to Shakespeare's life?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So they
&gt;&gt; accumulated &quot;evidence&quot; against him such as absence of
&gt;&gt; school attendance, documents indicating he sued people,
&gt;&gt; etc. The finding of secret messages in the works followed.
&gt;&gt; I think that it inevitably has to for such people--because
&gt;&gt; the lack of real evidence for their belief systems will
&gt;&gt; eventually bother even them. Hence, the jump into texts
&gt;&gt; that, when decoded, directly indicate . . . The Truth.
&gt;&gt; See, for instance, the way the Oxfordians are slowly
&gt;&gt; turning to a secret text in the Puttenham book, for
&gt;&gt; example. And Marlovians have decoded the inscription on
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's monument as a secret message in favor of
&gt;&gt; their belief system.

&gt;&gt; --Bob G.

"/>

I don't know anything about these. Would I want to consider them
right away, starting out? The other group in this ng seems to be more
concerned with biographies, directly, than with &quot;secret codes.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Yes, I think there is a lot of truth in what Bob says. The
&gt; very nature of any anti-Stratfordian's belief is that what
&gt; Bob calls the 'real evidence' is not to be trusted - much
&gt; of it having either been fabricated to promote a myth, or
&gt; unknowingly perpetuated by those who believed it. This
&gt; does mean that such evidence 'antis' present in support
&gt; of their beliefs will often have been either accidentally
&gt; left behind, or deliberately concealed.

"/>

I really don't have much &quot;feel&quot; for what the records of the time are
like. Was England, at that time, a place where good, modern-style
accurate records were being kept, or was it still pretty medieval? I
mean, certainly there are societies (even fairly recent ones) where I
wouldn't really expect government-released public records to be 100%
reliable. I feel I have to trust those who've actually done archival
research, and made this period their specialty, and hashed their ideas
out with others who also know the period, and convinced textbook
editors and other academics that they're the ones who know what
they're talking about. And they seem pretty certain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where most anti-Stratfordians go wrong, however - and
&gt; Marlovians are as guilty as anyone in this - is in failing
&gt; to understand that there are certain requirements which
&gt; must be met before *any* alleged 'hidden message' from
&gt; around that time can be taken seriously:

&gt; 1) It must *say* something, so a name on its own is
&gt; probably not good enough, and what it says must make as
&gt; much sense and be as grammatically correct as is reason-
&gt; able in the circumstances. (For example, this rule may
&gt; have to be relaxed a bit if both the plaintext *and* the
&gt; cyphertext must obey it).

&gt; 2) There must be a clue, key, or instruction for finding
&gt; the message, which can be written down fairly simply,
&gt; although this may be inferred, and need not be either
&gt; clearly specified or known to have been used before.

&gt; 3) The *probability* of finding that message (or an equal-
&gt; ly lucid one) by that method (or one of equal simplicity)
&gt; must be shown statistically to be so low as to be almost
&gt; impossible to have happened by chance.

"/>

I do agree, I think, though I'm not entirely sure I can follow all of
what you're saying. If there's a message, hidden or otherwise, it
follows that the message was put there for someone to find it and to
interpret it in the way the writer wanted. This means that it has to
be possible: to find and to interpret the message, and to be
relatively certain that the message was really there, that there isn't
a good chance the message means something else entirely, that the
&quot;message&quot; isn't just as likely to be an epiphenomenon of something
else. Because the person who thinks he or she has found a message
will want to be fairly certain that nobody else will be able to come
along and show that he or she is wrong. Can I assume that the
criteria you list here are generally accepted ones in cryptography, or
information theory, or some other related field?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where most *Stratfordians* go wrong is in being unable
&gt; (whether through a lack of intelligence, knowledge, or
&gt; courage - or simply too fixed a mind-set) to recognize
&gt; when such requirements have been met.

"/>

So I take it that you believe some &quot;anti-Stratfordians&quot; have made or
accepted bad arguments and don't understand why those arguments aren't
accepted, and that in addition, on the other hand, some
&quot;Stratfordians&quot; (those who accept the traditional histories) have
rejected some arguments that you believe to be good ones, involving
some kind of &quot;hidden codes&quot; in Shakespeare's plays?

&gt;&gt;&gt; My point is what I tried to illustrate in reply to Ms. Kositsky on
&gt;&gt;&gt; this thread. &quot;A house of illiterates&quot; and &quot;an average family&quot;
&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt; be interpretations of the same historical document (primary
&gt; source).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone who says, &quot;W.S. was born into an average family,&quot; is _not_
&gt;&gt;&gt; agreeing with, &quot;W.S. was born into a house of illiterates,&quot; even if
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone who says the latter provides the same footnote as someone
&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; says the former.

&gt;&gt; Those were not my words, Bianca. I never said that &quot;W.S. was born into a
&gt;&gt; house of illiterates.&quot; I don't tend to use words that way.

&gt; I am sorry. I did think you were defending those words, when you
&gt; challenged my reply to Mr. Crowley, but I didn't intend to
&gt; misrepresent you, and I should have made sure to reply to (or

That's fine. Don't worry about it. Just try not to put Paul Crowley's words

&gt; Just to be clear, I have nothing, really, against

&gt;&gt; an accurate description of how I personally came to have

&gt;&gt; didn't start out with the belief that William Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; couldn't (for whatever reason) have written the plays
&gt;&gt; attributed to him, and I still don't believe that, as it
&gt;&gt; happens.

&gt; May I ask, then, how you did come to those opinions, and
&gt; what they are?

"/>

I think it highly probable that Christopher Marlowe did
not in fact die when history says he did, but that his
death was faked and he subsequently played a major part
in writing the works that we know of as Shakespeare's.

I first read of this idea in an article, in *Esquire*
magazine, by a man called Calvin Hoffman, It made a
great story, but I assumed that a closer look at the
facts would reveal it to be the foolishness that it
clearly had to be. That was some forty years ago,
however, and having looked at the facts as closely as
anyone can have done since then, I still cannot fault
the theory, and much that I have found does in fact
strongly support it. Although Calvin Hoffman's original
argument was deeply flawed, and those of others since
him often not much better, I nevertheless now find it
far more likely that the basic theory is right than
that it is not.

If you are interested in further information, there
is plenty on my web-site, at the address given below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I do find it somewhat difficult to relate what we
&gt;&gt; know about Shakespeare's life to the competencies
&gt;&gt; demonstrated in the works, but still don't think it
&gt;&gt; impossible for him to have written them. I just
&gt;&gt; think it far more likely he had a *lot* of 'help'
&gt;&gt; from elsewhere.

&gt; My immediate guess would be that he probably did have
&gt; something like &quot;help,&quot; but I don't know that this would
&gt; really amount to &quot;help&quot; in the usual sense. If his
&gt; theatre company had some set of standard plots and
&gt; characters and situations and jokes, they would probably
&gt; have been developed over a long period of time, and
&gt; improved by the ideas of a lot of talented and experienced
&gt; people during that time. In addition to the known kinds of
&gt; sources, like already existing stories or plays or other
&gt; kinds of books. In your opinion, what in particular do
&gt; you find difficult to relate to Shakespeare's life?

"/>

The *range* of interests, ideas, associations, viewpoints
and images expressed and of words used. For me, this could
come only from a wide experience of life and a very highly
educated, well-travelled, influential, inquisitive, chall-
enging and artistic circle of friends and acquaintances.
We find nothing to indicate *anything* like this in Shake-
speare's biography.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; So they
&gt;&gt;&gt; accumulated &quot;evidence&quot; against him such as absence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; school attendance, documents indicating he sued people,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. The finding of secret messages in the works followed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that it inevitably has to for such people--because
&gt;&gt;&gt; the lack of real evidence for their belief systems will
&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually bother even them. Hence, the jump into texts
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, when decoded, directly indicate . . . The Truth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; See, for instance, the way the Oxfordians are slowly
&gt;&gt;&gt; turning to a secret text in the Puttenham book, for
&gt;&gt;&gt; example. And Marlovians have decoded the inscription on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's monument as a secret message in favor of
&gt;&gt;&gt; their belief system.

&gt;&gt;&gt; --Bob G.

&gt; I don't know anything about these. Would I want to consider
&gt; them right away, starting out? The other group in this ng
&gt; seems to be more concerned with biographies, directly, than
&gt; with &quot;secret codes.&quot;

"/>

Well, a major reason for my believing what I do is the
message that I claim to have found in Shakespeare's monument
at Stratford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think there is a lot of truth in what Bob says. The
&gt;&gt; very nature of any anti-Stratfordian's belief is that what
&gt;&gt; Bob calls the 'real evidence' is not to be trusted - much
&gt;&gt; of it having either been fabricated to promote a myth, or
&gt;&gt; unknowingly perpetuated by those who believed it. This
&gt;&gt; does mean that such evidence 'antis' present in support
&gt;&gt; of their beliefs will often have been either accidentally
&gt;&gt; left behind, or deliberately concealed.

&gt; I really don't have much &quot;feel&quot; for what the records of the
&gt; time are like. Was England, at that time, a place where
&gt; good, modern-style accurate records were being kept, or
&gt; was it still pretty medieval?

"/>

Those records which were required for legal reasons have
survived relatively well, whereas more personal documents,
such as private correspondence, has survived only in few
cases. You'll find a very good chapter on this at

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I
&gt; mean, certainly there are societies (even fairly recent ones)
&gt; where I wouldn't really expect government-released public
&gt; records to be 100% reliable. I feel I have to trust those
&gt; who've actually done archival research, and made this period
&gt; their specialty, and hashed their ideas out with others who
&gt; also know the period, and convinced textbook editors and
&gt; other academics that they're the ones who know what they're
&gt; talking about. And they seem pretty certain.

"/>

Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Where most anti-Stratfordians go wrong, however - and
&gt;&gt; Marlovians are as guilty as anyone in this - is in failing
&gt;&gt; to understand that there are certain requirements which
&gt;&gt; must be met before *any* alleged 'hidden message' from
&gt;&gt; around that time can be taken seriously:

&gt;&gt; 1) It must *say* something, so a name on its own is
&gt;&gt; probably not good enough, and what it says must make as
&gt;&gt; much sense and be as grammatically correct as is reason-
&gt;&gt; able in the circumstances. (For example, this rule may
&gt;&gt; have to be relaxed a bit if both the plaintext *and* the
&gt;&gt; cyphertext must obey it).

&gt;&gt; 2) There must be a clue, key, or instruction for finding
&gt;&gt; the message, which can be written down fairly simply,
&gt;&gt; although this may be inferred, and need not be either
&gt;&gt; clearly specified or known to have been used before.

&gt;&gt; 3) The *probability* of finding that message (or an equal-
&gt;&gt; ly lucid one) by that method (or one of equal simplicity)
&gt;&gt; must be shown statistically to be so low as to be almost
&gt;&gt; impossible to have happened by chance.

&gt; I do agree, I think, though I'm not entirely sure I can
&gt; follow all of what you're saying. If there's a message,
&gt; hidden or otherwise, it follows that the message was put
&gt; there for someone to find it

"/>

Not necessarily. Some might be there to be pointed out to
people with whom one wished to share (or already shared)
the secret, but not to others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and to interpret it in the way the writer wanted. This
&gt; means that it has to be possible: to find and to interpret
&gt; the message, and to be relatively certain that the message
&gt; was really there, that there isn't a good chance the
&gt; message means something else entirely, that the &quot;message&quot;
&gt; isn't just as likely to be an epiphenomenon of something
&gt; else.

"/>

Sounds about right to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Because the person who thinks he or she has found a
&gt; message will want to be fairly certain that nobody else
&gt; will be able to come along and show that he or she is
&gt; wrong. Can I assume that the criteria you list here are
&gt; generally accepted ones in cryptography, or information
&gt; theory, or some other related field?

"/>

They are derived to a large extent from a book by William
and Elizebeth Friedman &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined&quot;
(Cambridge 1957). However, the Friedmans' were concerned
mainly with ciphers alone, whereas many proposed 'hidden
messages' are of a different form, and my version tries to
reflect that wider field (particularly in 'rule' 1).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Where most *Stratfordians* go wrong is in being unable
&gt;&gt; (whether through a lack of intelligence, knowledge, or
&gt;&gt; courage - or simply too fixed a mind-set) to recognize
&gt;&gt; when such requirements have been met.

&gt; So I take it that you believe some &quot;anti-Stratfordians&quot;
&gt; have made or accepted bad arguments and don't understand
&gt; why those arguments aren't accepted,

"/>

Correct.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that in addition, on the other hand, some
&gt;&quot;Stratfordians&quot; (those who accept the traditional
&gt; histories) have rejected some arguments that you believe
&gt; to be good ones, involving some kind of &quot;hidden codes&quot;
&gt; in Shakespeare's plays?

"/>

Not in Shakespeare's plays. These would almost invariably
come within the other group. My remark was really only
about one hiddem message (and most people who have been
here longer than you know all about it!) which is the one
I mentioned above, hidden in the Shakespeare monument at
Stratford. In this case, I say that the probability of
the *clue* to its solution occurring by chance is so low
as to be virtually impossible, and therefore that the
message that I claim to have found *must* have been put
there deliberately.

Odds of picking 5 letters at random out of the 144 in the dedication
and getting HIRAM are 10/144 * 14/143 * 9/142* 5/141 * 2/140
or about 1 in 4.6 million. There are 2520 5-letter slots in the arrays,
and since Rollett allowed words to appear reading either up
or down, there are in effect 5040 places to search for HIRAM.

The chance of finding HIRAM somewhere
in some array is thus about 1 in 909.

The path of the total eclipse started in South America, passed over
the Sahara and ended in ARABIA. Barely a year later (May 20, 1594

of ARABIA (between Mecca to Medina) and passed over the

&quot;A noteworthy feature is the cherub-like boys who sit up aloft.
It is important to note that these little figures,
unfinished at the back, are carved in one piece
with the little mounds on which they sit -
- the one on the left holds a spade, the other an

INVERTED, EXTINGUISHED TORCH,
ONE HAND RESTING UPON A SKULL.&quot;

&lt;&lt;The festival of MITHRAS' birth was December 25th (winter solstice)
and the rebirth of the sun's light. He was forced out of a rock,
wearing the Phrygian cap, holding a dagger and TORCH in his hands.&gt;&gt;

2) Both &quot;MI(t)HRA(s)&quot; and his Zoroastrian arch enemy
&quot;(a)HRIMA(n)&quot; contain the name &quot;HIRAM&quot;

3) The highest level of Mithraism was called PATER and he taught
in CAVEs (like Belarius taught Guiderius and Arviragus in WALES):

&lt;&lt;The lowest degree of initiation into the grade of CORAX symbolized the
death of a new member, from which he would arise reborn as a new man.
This represented the end of his life as an unbeliever, and cancelled
previous allegiances to the other unacceptable beliefs. . .

&lt;&lt;Two other figures are rarely absent from the bull-slaying.
Dressed in Persian clothes similar to those of MITHRAS,
they are placed on either side of the bull and stand

*perfectly still with one leg in front of the other*

as if taking no part in the action. In some cases, however, one of them
holds the bull's tail, apparently in order to share its magic power or
to stimulate the growth of the corn ears sprouting from it. Sometimes
these figures are represented as shepherds who were present at the birth
of MITHRAS, but they differ in character from Attis, for each carries a
TORCH pointing either upward or downward, by which they illustrate the
ascending or descending path of Sol and Luna, the rising and setting
sources of light, life and death. Generally the bearer with the uplifted
TORCH is placed under Luna and his COMPANION under Sol.
Their names-Cautes, symbol of the rising morning sun,

and Cautopates, the setting evening sun-

have not yet been linguistically explained, but their symbolism
has been deduced from the various representations.

You've actually hit the nail on the head, David. &quot;Burghley was a public
figure of long tenure and considerable influence.&quot; Do you think he would
have put up with a commoner making fun of him? And not once, but twice. I
found the following, spoken by the countess in _All's Well That Ends Well_,
while I was looking for a quote for a dedication for one of my novels:

Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father,
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

And while we are speaking of it, do you think a commoner would have known
about Burghley's precepts to his son, or do you think they were known only
&quot;to a small circle of intimates&quot;?

See   for them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Hardly. The &quot;evidence&quot; crashes to the ground if you don't agree with the
&gt;&gt; interpretation. Title pages and the monument don't crash, Lynne.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's hard to know how he would have dared make fun of one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the most poweful men in the kingdom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How come?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, lest people think only the Oxfordians believe that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Polonius
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a caricature of Burghley, many traditional scholars have
&gt;&gt; suggested
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this was the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but that doesn't mean it was accepted as such when it was
first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm afraid it would have been much more obvious, especially as the
&gt;&gt; name
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the early quarto (Corambis, I believe) was a play on his motto,
cor
&gt;&gt;&gt; unum,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; via una.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact it was so recognisable it was changed to Polonius in later
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; editions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and, presumably, performances. It is possible that someone
whispered a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the wise.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So obvious no contemporary noted it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm really not sure about that, Neil. I'd have to research it.

&gt;&gt; Please do. Oxfordian research is so amusing.

&gt; It is indeed!

Well, then, of course, I won't undertake any research on behalf of you two.
You can get your merriment somewhere else. Perhaps in the Shakespeare tavern
of universal knowledge?

Best wishes,
Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anti-semitic is not uneducated. Nor is an unpleasant background a bar to
&gt;&gt;&gt; being a genius or an author.
&gt;&gt; But dealing in grain is?
&gt; Nope, of course not. Not if the grain dealer in question could be shown to
&gt; have an almost unparallelled education, a brilliant mind, and an interest in
&gt; the nobility, etc, etc, etc. Although he would be rather busy.

"/>

Not even a tenth as busy as the Brame-Popova Shakespeare, the Zenner
Shakespeare, the Neuendorffer Shakespeare, or the Streitz Shakespeare
must have been! Some of the more...ah...eccentric anti-Stratfordians,
including those enumerated above, attribute to the author a prodigious
canon.

For example, Mr. Streitz helpfully furnishes a table, &quot;The Oxford
Canon,&quot; which he diffidently concedes is &quot;only a preliminary effort at
establishing the full canon of Oxford's works.&quot; In addition to the
entire Shakespeare canon, the list includes the following:

_Jack the Juggler_ (Anon.)
_Spinning Wheel Poem_ (&quot;found in Cecil papers to Anne Cecil [sic]&quot;)
_The historie of Leonard Aretine_, Leonardo Bruni (Arthur Golding
translation)
_The abridgment of the histories of Trogvs Pompeius_, Marcus Junianus
(Golding translation)
Golding's translation of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_
_Palamon &amp; Arcyte_ (Edwards)
_Damon &amp; Pythias_ (Edwards)
_The eyght bookes of Caius Iulius Caesar_ (Golding translation)
_Ralph Roister Doister_ (Udall)
_Doleful Ditty of Lord Darnleigh_ (Chettle)
_Agamomnon_, _Medea_, _Hyppolytus_, _Hercules Oeteus_ (Studley
translations of Seneca)
_Palaemon and Areite_ (Anon.)
_Jocasta, Euripides_ [sic!] (Gascoigne-Kinwelmershe translation)
_Gli Supposit, The Supposes_ (Gascoigne translation of Ariosto)
_Horestes_ (Pikering translation)
_The Courtier_ (Clerke translation of Castiglione)
_The Adventures of Master F.I._
_The Famous Victories of Henry V_ (Anon.)
_Thomas of Woodstock_ (Anon.)
_Arden of Feversham_ (Anon.)
_A Discourse upon the earthquake that happened through the realme of
Englande and other places of Christendom, the sixt of Aprill, 1580_
(Golding)
_Sapho and Phao_ (Lyly translation)
_Campaspe_ (Lyly translation)
_Greene's Card of Fancy_ (Lyly)
_Spanish Trajedgy [sic]_ (Kyd)
_Willobie His Avisa_ (Willobie)
_Edward the Second_ (attrib. Marlowe)
_Locrine_
_Isle of Dogs_ (Nashe)
_The First Set of English Madrigals_ (Farmer)

and others. In addition, Mr. Streitz adds a lengthy list of works &quot;For
Consideration&quot; in the Oxford canon. This list includes most of the
anonymous plays of the period, translations of Apuleius and Theocritus,
North's translation of Plutarch, etc.

Elsewhere, Mr. Streitz furnishes an amusing sidebar in which he
attempts to list the Earl of Oxford's putative pseudonyms:

&quot;The following attempts to list Oxford's pen names. Some of
these names are obvious pseudonyms, others are Latin phrases, and
finally there are living people. Many of these living people had
literary histories that are highly suspect. Many produced only one
or two works that orthodox scholars say 'influenced' Shakespeare,
and then the authors disappeared from history. One such case is
John Lyly, the longtime secretary for the Earl of Oxford. Lyly is
credited with several works, including the earliest novel _Euphues_.
Strangely, although he lived another ten years after leaving Oxford's
service (perhaps for being a spy for William Cecil), John Lyly never
wrote another literary work.

A True English Man
Arthur Brooke -- _Romeus and Juliette_
Arthur Golding -- Ovid's _Metamorphoses_
The Auchthour
Christopher Marlowe
Clement Robinson -- _Handful of Pleasant Delights_
Dan Bartholomew of Bathe
Dan Bartholomew His Name I Hide
Deepe Disire
Deere Familyar Friend
Dewe Desert
Geffrey Gates
George Gascoigne
George Pettie -- _Pettie's Palace of Pleasure_
The Greene Knight

[Since, as we shall see below, Oxford was also Robert Greene, why not?]

Ignoto
John Dowland (Music) Oxford author of the song 'Green Sleeves'?
John Lyly -- _Campaspe_, _Sapho and Phao_, etc.
John Pykering -- _Horestes_
John Studely
Martin Mar-prelate -- Political Tracts
Master Edouardo Donati
Master F. I.
Meritum petere, grave
Nemiesis
The Oke
Philomene
The Reporter
Robert Greene (Ver?)

[I am not making this up.]

Sylvanus Mercuire
Thomas Kyd -- _The Spanish Tragedy_, _Arden of Feversham_
William Adlington -- _The Golden Asse_
William North -- _Lives of the Ancient Greeks and Romans_ [sic]

[Here, of course, Mr. Streitz appears to be confusing *William* North
with Sir *Thomas* North . Nor does Mr. Streitz appear to be aware that
North's _The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romanes_ on which
Shakespeare drew so heavily was itself a translation of Plutarch .]

William Shakespeare&quot;

Even more amusingly, Art Neuendorffer attributes the works of
Cervantes to the author of the Shakespeare canon! Art seems to imagine
that these works were later translated into Spanish!

Just recently, Mr. Zenner wrote: &quot;I have a list of over 250 names
which I believe were pen names of William Pierce.&quot; The list evidently
includes Shakespeare, Thomas Harriot, Francis Bacon, and many others.

Lynne's concern that Shakespeare must have been &quot;rather busy&quot; is most
amusing in view of the prodigious industry attritbuted to the man by
some of Lynne's nuttier coreligionists!

Lots of people(myself included) have pointed out that Burghley's precepts
are not much like Polonius's precepts.

Steve Roth(author of the site you link to) concurs:

So here's the whole document for your perusal. Reading it myself, I
find only some similarity to Polonius's speech, and that not very
remarkable. Judge for yourself.

But to go back to Nabokov, David, wasn't it you who just said:

&quot;Actually, to the limited extent that Nabokov's character Pnin is
inspired by any living person, it is almost certainly by Marc Szeftel, a
Cornell colleague of Nabokov's. If Nabokov's alter ego appears in the
novel, it is more recognizably in the person of Vladimir Vladimirovich,
the narrator, an Anglophile Russian professor with a passion for
lepidoptera whose arrival to take a post at Waindell College forces
Pnin's departure.&quot;

Quite an astounding statement, in light of what you wrote before.
Best wishes,
Lynne

Obviously Burghley was a front man for some noble running things from the
shadows. It would have been impossible for a mere commoner -- especially the
grandson of a tavernkeeper and the son of an upstart social climber -- to
have risen to such heights of influence.

do.

He fitted what he knew of Nabokov's life to his work. And it is a rather
good fit. No one seems to find that unusual, although David himself gave
Nabokov as an example of a fiction writer who didn't believe one could read
a writer's biography in his work--or at least said that &quot;discoveries&quot; about
him from his writing were apt to be wrong. I had remarked that it was not a
surprise he should do so--after all, Nabokov's most famous work is about a
child molester. It caused a sensation, as you likely know, when it was
published, and I'm quite sure Nabokov would not want to be associated with
Humbert.

I don't think so. The more David makes jokes about Cogno, by the way, the

sonnets. Not only that, but the poetry of a much older man to a younger.

Were they lame? Did they use &quot;I am that I am&quot; of themselves? Did they carry
the canopy? (Perhaps Essex did; I'd have to check). Were they intimately
connected with Burghley? With his daughter, Anne Cecil? (And yes, I have
another pile of orthodox critics who believe Ophelia was based on Anne.) And
so on, and so on. The list of coincidences is so long as to be incredible if
the author is NOT Oxford. After all, didn't most of us get rather upset when

David can only do a subjective reading of Nabokov's works. There is no other
reading possible. If you turn Looney's theory around, we are now fitting
Oxford's biography to the canon, just as David has done in a minor way with
Nabokov.

Cervantes himself claims the works were translated into Spanish:

&lt;&lt;Cervantes interrupts the narrative thread to tell us that the translator
of Cid Hamet Ben Engeli's work found a note in Engeli's handwriting,
recorded in the margins of the original text. Engeli does not believe
that Don Quixote tells the truth, arguing that Quixote actually
recounted the story on his deathbed. Cid Hamet Ben Engeli also added
that because Sancho Panza was so impertinent and disrespectful to
Don Quixote, the account seems all the more likely to be apocryphal.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't understand, Neil -- Oxford's biography permeates the

&gt; Earl
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Oxford's rapturous appreciation of Orazio Cogno's buttocks. Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, _The Tinpest_ is autobiographical as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that only a Bush family member could have written Michael
&gt; Moore's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books?

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not a parallel situation, David, by any means.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rather evidence that Shakespeare of Stratford didn't write the
&gt; works
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley was a public figure of long tenure and considerable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; influence. He was not exactly an obscure functionary known only to a

&gt;&gt;&gt; small circle of intimates.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You've actually hit the nail on the head, David. &quot;Burghley was a public
&gt;&gt;&gt; figure of long tenure and considerable influence.&quot; Do you think he would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have put up with a commoner making fun of him? And not once, but twice.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; found the following, spoken by the countess in _All's Well That Ends
&gt; Well_,
&gt;&gt;&gt; while I was looking for a quote for a dedication for one of my novels:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father,
&gt;&gt;&gt; In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
&gt;&gt;&gt; Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
&gt;&gt;&gt; Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
&gt;&gt;&gt; Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
&gt;&gt;&gt; But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
&gt;&gt;&gt; That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Advise him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And while we are speaking of it, do you think a commoner would have
&gt; known
&gt;&gt;&gt; about Burghley's precepts to his son, or do you think they were known
&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;to a small circle of intimates&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; See  http://www.princehamlet.com/burghley.html  for them.

&gt;&gt; Lots of people(myself included) have pointed out that Burghley's precepts
&gt;&gt; are not much like Polonius's precepts.

&gt;&gt; Steve Roth(author of the site you link to) concurs:

&gt;&gt; So here's the whole document for your perusal. Reading it myself, I
&gt;&gt; find only some similarity to Polonius's speech, and that not very
&gt;&gt; remarkable. Judge for yourself.

&gt; Traditionalists George Russell French (1869), Lillian Winstanley (1920), E.
&gt; K. Chambers (1930), J. Dover Wilson (1937), Conyers Read (1955), Joel
&gt; Hurstfield (1958), and A.L. Rowse (1983), do not agree with either of you.

"/>

As it happens, I have Chambers at hand:

It has been often thought that Polonius may glance at Lord Burghley,
who wrote _Certain Preceptes, or Directions_ for the use of his son
Robert Cecil. These were printed (1618) 'from a more perfect
copie, than ordinarily those pocket manuscripts goe warranted by'.
Conceivably Shakespeare knew a pocket manuscript... [_William
Shakespeare_, i. 418]

Ok...

#1. Chambers knew of a number of authorities who believed
that there was possibly a connection between the precepts.

#2. Chambers noted that the printer's blurb implied that
the printer got his copy of Burghley's precepts from
a pocket manuscript.

#3. Chambers noted that in his view, it was conceivable
that Shakespeare knew a pocket manuscript.

That's supposed to be evidence that Chambers personally
thought that Burghley's precepts were much like
Polonius's?

I think not.

From what Mark has in his slides at the site url
you gave below...

Read says(about Burghley's precepts) that &quot;Even
Polonius was never quite so tedious and pedantic
as this.&quot; (Can't see why Mark thinks this supports
his case.)

Hurstfield wrote that the two sets of precepts
had a similarly &quot;paternalistic and patronizing&quot;
tone. (So what?)

Rowse wrote that the precepts were &quot;strikingly
similar.&quot; (Opinion only.) Rowse thought that
that Burghley=Polonius identification was
probable. (A few Burghley/Polonius similarities
cited.)

Neither Dover Wilson or Winstanley are shown as
saying anything about parallels between the
precepts. Both think Burghley=Polonius is
probable. (Opinion only from Wilson. Some
Burghley/Polonius similarities from Winstanley.)

I didn't see French on Mark's site, but your cite
below also doesn't say anything about parallels
between the sets of precepts. His opinion on
the Burghley=Polonius idea is qualified with a
&quot;supposedly&quot;. (That's an endorsement?)

The point was whether or not there are any
remarkable similarities between the precepts
and on that point, according to what Mark has
up on his site, we've got just Rowse and
Hurstfield saying &quot;yes.&quot; (Seems like a pretty
a pretty feeble collection.)

you.

Rob, I'm having some trouble copying from the site so please bear with me.
Look at Connection One of 25 Connections for what George Russell French
says. He does not mention the precepts directly, but says Polonius is
supposed to stand for Cecil. (He also mentions correspondences to other
members of the family). It is hard to understand where he got this idea
unless it's at least in part from the precepts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; As it happens, I have Chambers at hand:

&gt; It has been often thought that Polonius may glance at Lord Burghley,

&gt; #3. Chambers noted that in his view, it was conceivable

"/>

You notice he doesn't deny in any way that the precepts come from Burghley,
and instead tries to construct a scenario whereby Shakespeare may have read
them because in fact he goes along with the &quot;number of authorities&quot; who
thought there was a connection. So there are probably even more traditional
scholars than Mark has listed who feel there was likely a parallel between
the precepts in the play and Burghley's precepts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; That's supposed to be evidence that Chambers personally
&gt; thought that Burghley's precepts were much like
&gt; Polonius's?

"/>

Of course. As I said above, he thinks the weight of opinion is that they are
so similar he's trying to find a way for Shakespeare of Stratford to have
seen them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I think not.

I think you didn't read carefully.

I can't see but that you are misreading, Rob. He says that &quot;this is the sort
of sermon that Willian Cecil used to preach to young men...&quot; followed by
your quote. It's obvious that he is saying that Cecil was even WORSE than
Polonius. Why bring Polonius up at all if he didn't think he was a
caricature of Cecil? (Slide 14)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Hurstfield wrote that the two sets of precepts
&gt; had a similarly &quot;paternalistic and patronizing&quot;

"/>

He also said, with regard to Burghley's wordiness: &quot;It is the authentic
voice of Polonius...&quot; And he also calls Lord Burghley &quot;Shakespeare's
Polonius&quot; directly (Slide 15).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Rowse wrote that the precepts were &quot;strikingly
&gt; similar.&quot; (Opinion only.)

"/>

Everything is opinion only with regard to this question, wouldn't you say?
Except that the opinion of so many traditionalists (without my even
enlisting the help of anti-Stratfordian critics) becomes overwhelming.

Rowse thought that

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that Burghley=Polonius identification was
&gt; probable. (A few Burghley/Polonius similarities
&gt; cited.)

"/>

No, he actually said: &quot;there are certain specific references reflecting
Burghley's known characteristics&quot; and further down on the same slide, The
Reader's Encyclopedia of Shakespeare (traditionalist) says: &quot;Polonius'
famous advice to Laertes is strikingly similar to Burghley's precepts in
this treatise...&quot; (Slide 16)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Neither Dover Wilson or Winstanley are shown as
&gt; saying anything about parallels between the
&gt; precepts. Both think Burghley=Polonius is
&gt; probable. (Opinion only from Wilson. Some

"/>

Look at slide 11 for Winstanley's correspondences. She says that Cecil wrote
letters to his son Thomas full of &quot;wise maxims for his guidance...&quot; and
follows up with a parallel to Polonius. She doesn't directly mention the
precepts in the play, but as she's already spoken of them with regard to
Cecil, they are understood to be there. Dover Wilson, you are correct, says
nothing about the precepts but states &quot;Polonius is almost without doubt
intended as a caricature of Burleigh...&quot; (Slide 13) Again, it is hard to
know how he is identified except by his wordiness and the precepts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I didn't see French on Mark's site, but your cite
&gt; below also doesn't say anything about parallels

Count again. And of course the important thing, which is what I was arguing
before you joined the thread, is that many traditional scholars have
identified Polonius as a caricature of Burghley.

Thank you for the interesting dialogue.

April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln on GOOD FRIDAY.
The Grants were supposed to have joined them, but Julia Grant had heard
of Mary Todd Lincoln's almost insane jealousy and declined. Lincoln had
had premonitory dreams about his death, but he had walked the streets of
reoccupied Richmond during the week before unharmed. The play that they
were watching was Our American Cousin, in which some character asks this
riddle: &quot;When is a dog's tail not a tail?&quot; (When it's a-waggin')

April 14, 1861, Col. Robert Anderson and his men lowered the Federal

We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated,
inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that's scarred from stem
to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and is so
cultured, so educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him
&quot;all cat-knowledge is his province&quot;; also, take a mouse. Lock the
three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half an
hour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian,
and let them cipher and assume. The mouse is missing: the question to
be decided is, where is it? You can guess both verdicts beforehand.
One verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as
certainly say the mouse is in the tomcat.

The Shakespearite will Reason like this--(that is not my word,
it is his). He will say the kitten may have been attending school when
nobody was noticing; therefore we are warranted in assuming that it
did so; also, it could have been training in a court-clerk's office
when no one was noticing; since that could have happened, we are
justified in assuming that it did happen; it could have studied
catology in a garret when no one was noticing--therefore it did; it
could have attended cat-assizes on the shedroof nights, for
recreation, when no one was noticing, and harvested a knowledge of cat
court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way: it could have done it,
therefore without a doubt it did; it could have gone soldiering with a
war-tribe when no one was noticing, and learned soldierwiles and
soldier-ways, and what to do with a mouse when opportunity offers; the
plain inference, therefore is, that that is what it did. Since all
these manifold things could have occurred, we have every right to
believe they did occur. These patiently and painstakingly accumulated
vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing
more--opportunity--to convert themselves into triumphant action. The
opportunity came, we have the result; beyond shadow of question the
mouse is in the kitten.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It doesn't. It's just one of a myriad circumstantial pieces of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; link him to the canon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't understand, Neil -- Oxford's biography permeates the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; canon. For example, _All's well: that end's swell_ is clearly the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Earl
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Oxford's rapturous appreciation of Orazio Cogno's buttocks. Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, _The Tinpest_ is autobiographical as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you accept the interpretation that Polonius is Cecil. Since
&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation ONLY, it doesn't approach the weight of, say, Ben
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; testimony.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley was his guardian and father in law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was also well known to everyone in the realm. Lynne, do you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that only a Bush family member could have written Michael
&gt;&gt;&gt; Moore's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not a parallel situation, David, by any means.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rather evidence that Shakespeare of Stratford didn't write the
&gt;&gt;&gt; works
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley was a public figure of long tenure and considerable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; influence. He was not exactly an obscure functionary known only
&gt; to a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; small circle of intimates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You've actually hit the nail on the head, David. &quot;Burghley was a
&gt; public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; figure of long tenure and considerable influence.&quot; Do you think he
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have put up with a commoner making fun of him? And not once, but
&gt; twice.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found the following, spoken by the countess in _All's Well That Ends
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well_,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while I was looking for a quote for a dedication for one of my
&gt; novels:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Advise him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And while we are speaking of it, do you think a commoner would have
&gt;&gt;&gt; known
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Burghley's precepts to his son, or do you think they were
&gt; known
&gt;&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;to a small circle of intimates&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See  http://www.princehamlet.com/burghley.html  for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lots of people(myself included) have pointed out that Burghley's
&gt; precepts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are not much like Polonius's precepts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve Roth(author of the site you link to) concurs:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So here's the whole document for your perusal. Reading it myself, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find only some similarity to Polonius's speech, and that not very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remarkable. Judge for yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Traditionalists George Russell French (1869), Lillian Winstanley (1920),
&gt; E.
&gt;&gt;&gt; K. Chambers (1930), J. Dover Wilson (1937), Conyers Read (1955), Joel
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hurstfield (1958), and A.L. Rowse (1983), do not agree with either of
&gt; you.

&gt; Rob, I'm having some trouble copying from the site so please bear with me.
&gt; Look at Connection One of 25 Connections for what George Russell French
&gt; says. He does not mention the precepts directly, but says Polonius is
&gt; supposed to stand for Cecil. (He also mentions correspondences to other
&gt; members of the family). It is hard to understand where he got this idea
&gt; unless it's at least in part from the precepts.

&gt;&gt; As it happens, I have Chambers at hand:

&gt;&gt; It has been often thought that Polonius may glance at Lord Burghley,
&gt;&gt; who wrote _Certain Preceptes, or Directions_ for the use of his son
&gt;&gt; Robert Cecil. These were printed (1618) 'from a more perfect
&gt;&gt; copie, than ordinarily those pocket manuscripts goe warranted by'.
&gt;&gt; Conceivably Shakespeare knew a pocket manuscript... [_William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare_, i. 418]

&gt;&gt; Ok...

&gt;&gt; #1. Chambers knew of a number of authorities who believed
&gt;&gt; that there was possibly a connection between the precepts.

&gt;&gt; #2. Chambers noted that the printer's blurb implied that
&gt;&gt; the printer got his copy of Burghley's precepts from
&gt;&gt; a pocket manuscript.

&gt;&gt; #3. Chambers noted that in his view, it was conceivable
&gt;&gt; that Shakespeare knew a pocket manuscript.

&gt; You notice he doesn't deny in any way that the precepts come from Burghley,

"/>

So not-denying is logically equivalent to being-in-favor-of?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and instead tries to construct a scenario whereby Shakespeare may have read

"/>

Something that is perfectly consistent with him being agnostic
or even against the idea.

Suppose for a moment that Chambers didn't see much merit in the
idea but he understood that he was not omniscient and so could
be wrong. (It seems to me that he was merely being a careful
scholar.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; them because in fact he goes along with the &quot;number of authorities&quot; who
&gt; thought there was a connection.

"/>

If he went along with it, I'm pretty sure he'd have told us
directly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So there are probably even more traditional
&gt; scholars than Mark has listed who feel there was likely a parallel between
&gt; the precepts in the play and Burghley's precepts.

"/>

I have no firm handle on how many scholars have thought it likely,
but I would guess it has always been a minority.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's supposed to be evidence that Chambers personally
&gt;&gt; thought that Burghley's precepts were much like
&gt;&gt; Polonius's?

&gt; Of course. As I said above, he thinks the weight of opinion is that they are
&gt; so similar he's trying to find a way for Shakespeare of Stratford to have
&gt; seen them.

"/>

He says little about the weight of opinion. The &quot;often
thought&quot; tells us no more than that he understood the
percentage of readers who seeing correspondence to be
considerably above zero. (eg. If one scholar in five
expressed the opinion, it would be enough to to say
&quot;often thought&quot;, but the weight of opinions could be as
low as 20%.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think not.

&gt; I think you didn't read carefully.

"/>

If Chambers supported the idea, the words &quot;It has been
often thought&quot; were a damn strange way to put it. (There's
not a hint of personal belief. )

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; From what Mark has in his slides at the site url
&gt;&gt; you gave below...

&gt;&gt; Read says(about Burghley's precepts) that &quot;Even
&gt;&gt; Polonius was never quite so tedious and pedantic
&gt;&gt; as this.&quot; (Can't see why Mark thinks this supports
&gt;&gt; his case.)

&gt; I can't see but that you are misreading, Rob. He says that &quot;this is the sort
&gt; of sermon that Willian Cecil used to preach to young men...&quot; followed by
&gt; your quote. It's obvious that he is saying that Cecil was even WORSE than
&gt; Polonius. Why bring Polonius up at all if he didn't think he was a
&gt; caricature of Cecil? (Slide 14)

"/>

First of all, the word &quot;caricature&quot; implies that Polonius's characteristics
should be Cecil's characteristics exaggerated to the point of insult.
Saying that Cecil was even WORSE than Polonius takes it in the wrong
direction. (What sort of a caricature of Cecil would take one of his
more obnoxious characteristics and lessen it? Where's the insult in
that?)

There is no doubt that Polonius provided Read with a very well-known
contemporary point of comparison, which seems to be enough to explain
why he might bring him up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Hurstfield wrote that the two sets of precepts
&gt;&gt; had a similarly &quot;paternalistic and patronizing&quot;
&gt;&gt; tone. (So what?)

&gt; He also said, with regard to Burghley's wordiness: &quot;It is the authentic
&gt; voice of Polonius...&quot;

"/>

That's pure opinion, which, not knowing anything about
Hurstfield's reputation, I have no idea how to weight.
(Actually, if I assume that Hurstfield's &quot;paternalistic
and patronizing&quot; are the points he found most significant,
my first impulse is to weigh his opinion very low.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And he also calls Lord Burghley &quot;Shakespeare's
&gt; Polonius&quot; directly (Slide 15).

"/>

Yes. It was those words which I took nail down
his opinion rather firmly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Rowse wrote that the precepts were &quot;strikingly
&gt;&gt; similar.&quot; (Opinion only.)

&gt; Everything is opinion only with regard to this question, wouldn't you say?

"/>

As I don't see any easy way to boil it down to hard facts,
perhaps that's fair to say. However, when I see
opinions from scholars I don't know anything about,
or worse, scholars like Rowse, whom I don't trust, I
want to see some details on how they reached their
opinions. At the very least, I'd like them to list
the parallels they found most significant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Except that the opinion of so many traditionalists (without my even
&gt; enlisting the help of anti-Stratfordian critics) becomes overwhelming.

"/>

So many? How do you know the percentage of traditionalists who
have thought the identification likely isn't considerably below
50%? How do you know it isn't considerably below 10%?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rowse thought that
&gt;&gt; that Burghley=Polonius identification was
&gt;&gt; probable. (A few Burghley/Polonius similarities
&gt;&gt; cited.)

&gt; No, he actually said: &quot;there are certain specific references reflecting
&gt; Burghley's known characteristics&quot; and further down on the same slide, The

&gt; If you are interested in further information, there
&gt; is plenty on my web-site, at the address given below.

"/>

Thanks. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to make of it,
unfortunately.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I do find it somewhat difficult to relate what we
&gt;&gt;&gt; know about Shakespeare's life to the competencies
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrated in the works, but still don't think it
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible for him to have written them. I just
&gt;&gt;&gt; think it far more likely he had a *lot* of 'help'
&gt;&gt;&gt; from elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; My immediate guess would be that he probably did have
&gt;&gt; something like &quot;help,&quot; but I don't know that this would
&gt;&gt; really amount to &quot;help&quot; in the usual sense. If his
&gt;&gt; theatre company had some set of standard plots and
&gt;&gt; characters and situations and jokes, they would probably
&gt;&gt; have been developed over a long period of time, and
&gt;&gt; improved by the ideas of a lot of talented and experienced
&gt;&gt; people during that time. In addition to the known kinds of
&gt;&gt; sources, like already existing stories or plays or other
&gt;&gt; kinds of books. In your opinion, what in particular do
&gt;&gt; you find difficult to relate to Shakespeare's life?

&gt; The *range* of interests, ideas, associations, viewpoints
&gt; and images expressed and of words used. For me, this could
&gt; come only from a wide experience of life and a very highly
&gt; educated, well-travelled, influential, inquisitive, chall-
&gt; enging and artistic circle of friends and acquaintances.
&gt; We find nothing to indicate *anything* like this in Shake-
&gt; speare's biography.

"/>

But in most times, this kind of experience and society are often found
in theatre circles in large urban centers. I have a difficult time
trying to imagine what you think is missing (much less why you think
it's more likely present for Marlowe than for William Shakespeare).

[snip]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I really don't have much &quot;feel&quot; for what the records of the
&gt;&gt; time are like. Was England, at that time, a place where
&gt;&gt; good, modern-style accurate records were being kept, or
&gt;&gt; was it still pretty medieval?

&gt; Those records which were required for legal reasons have
&gt; survived relatively well, whereas more personal documents,
&gt; such as private correspondence, has survived only in few
&gt; cases. You'll find a very good chapter on this at
&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/survival.html

"/>

Thanks. One reason I asked is that I know for the period not long
before this, most &quot;primary source&quot; research is done from digests, not
from the records themselves. In the United States, we expect the
government to release the contents of public records (anything having
to do with the operations of government) to anybody, at any time (the
Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act make this mandatory,
with a few exceptions), but I've gathered that in Britain, the
government seems to keep a tighter hold over archives. I have seen
several footnotes that read something like, &quot;I'm grateful to so-and-so
(apparently a native of the country being studied) for providing me
with a copy of this record.&quot; And even in fairly recent times, in
parts of Europe, vital statistics were kept by parish priests, not by
secular officials, even in areas of mixed ethnicity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; mean, certainly there are societies (even fairly recent ones)
&gt;&gt; where I wouldn't really expect government-released public
&gt;&gt; records to be 100% reliable. I feel I have to trust those
&gt;&gt; who've actually done archival research, and made this period
&gt;&gt; their specialty, and hashed their ideas out with others who
&gt;&gt; also know the period, and convinced textbook editors and
&gt;&gt; other academics that they're the ones who know what they're
&gt;&gt; talking about. And they seem pretty certain.

&gt; Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where most anti-Stratfordians go wrong, however - and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marlovians are as guilty as anyone in this - is in failing
&gt;&gt;&gt; to understand that there are certain requirements which
&gt;&gt;&gt; must be met before *any* alleged 'hidden message' from
&gt;&gt;&gt; around that time can be taken seriously:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) It must *say* something, so a name on its own is
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably not good enough, and what it says must make as
&gt;&gt;&gt; much sense and be as grammatically correct as is reason-
&gt;&gt;&gt; able in the circumstances. (For example, this rule may
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to be relaxed a bit if both the plaintext *and* the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cyphertext must obey it).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) There must be a clue, key, or instruction for finding
&gt;&gt;&gt; the message, which can be written down fairly simply,
&gt;&gt;&gt; although this may be inferred, and need not be either
&gt;&gt;&gt; clearly specified or known to have been used before.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) The *probability* of finding that message (or an equal-
&gt;&gt;&gt; ly lucid one) by that method (or one of equal simplicity)
&gt;&gt;&gt; must be shown statistically to be so low as to be almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible to have happened by chance.

&gt;&gt; I do agree, I think, though I'm not entirely sure I can
&gt;&gt; follow all of what you're saying. If there's a message,
&gt;&gt; hidden or otherwise, it follows that the message was put
&gt;&gt; there for someone to find it

&gt; Not necessarily. Some might be there to be pointed out to
&gt; people with whom one wished to share (or already shared)
&gt; the secret, but not to others.

"/>

In which case, I'd think, the messages would be entirely lost, over
time, wouldn't they? This was a thought I had, reading Rowse's book
on the Elizabethan Renaissance: that all that individualism had
resulted in a lot of personal creativity, which had meant something to
the people who wrote it down, or painted it, or composed madrigals
incorporating it, but which we really can't interpret today.

Incidentally, I'd be curious whether I am or am not the only
person who used to believe that the word &quot;madrigal&quot; indicated a song
for accompanied solo voice. This made absolutely no sense, given what
I was reading in Rowse, and eventually I went and looked it up. (It's
a choral work that isn't a mass, but is usually based on an original
lyric.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and to interpret it in the way the writer wanted. This
&gt;&gt; means that it has to be possible: to find and to interpret
&gt;&gt; the message, and to be relatively certain that the message
&gt;&gt; was really there, that there isn't a good chance the
&gt;&gt; message means something else entirely, that the &quot;message&quot;
&gt;&gt; isn't just as likely to be an epiphenomenon of something
&gt;&gt; else.

&gt; Sounds about right to me.

&gt;&gt; Because the person who thinks he or she has found a
&gt;&gt; message will want to be fairly certain that nobody else
&gt;&gt; will be able to come along and show that he or she is
&gt;&gt; wrong. Can I assume that the criteria you list here are
&gt;&gt; generally accepted ones in cryptography, or information
&gt;&gt; theory, or some other related field?

&gt; They are derived to a large extent from a book by William
&gt; and Elizebeth Friedman &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined&quot;
&gt; (Cambridge 1957). However, the Friedmans' were concerned
&gt; mainly with ciphers alone, whereas many proposed 'hidden
&gt; messages' are of a different form, and my version tries to
&gt; reflect that wider field (particularly in 'rule' 1).

"/>

I always seem to have difficulty with codes, etc., myself, other than
having picked up enough about ciphers from children's books to be able
to do puzzles in magazines. (Not &quot;British&quot; crosswords, though --
every time I solve a punning clue, I feel ashamed for having thought
of such a bad joke.) If I thought about it long enough, I could
probably come up with a plausible psychological reason why this is the
case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Where most *Stratfordians* go wrong is in being unable
&gt;&gt;&gt; (whether through a lack of intelligence, knowledge, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; courage - or simply too fixed a mind-set) to recognize
&gt;&gt;&gt; when such requirements have been met.

&gt;&gt; So I take it that you believe some &quot;anti-Stratfordians&quot;
&gt;&gt; have made or accepted bad arguments and don't understand
&gt;&gt; why those arguments aren't accepted,

&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt; and that in addition, on the other hand, some
&gt;&gt;&quot;Stratfordians&quot; (those who accept the traditional
&gt;&gt; histories) have rejected some arguments that you believe
&gt;&gt; to be good ones, involving some kind of &quot;hidden codes&quot;
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's plays?

&gt; Not in Shakespeare's plays. These would almost invariably
&gt; come within the other group. My remark was really only
&gt; about one hiddem message (and most people who have been
&gt; here longer than you know all about it!) which is the one
&gt; I mentioned above, hidden in the Shakespeare monument at
&gt; Stratford. In this case, I say that the probability of
&gt; the *clue* to its solution occurring by chance is so low
&gt; as to be virtually impossible, and therefore that the
&gt; message that I claim to have found *must* have been put
&gt; there deliberately.

"/>

The problem I generally have with arguments about &quot;secret messages&quot; is
that perhaps the decoded message is, itself, in code. Or perhaps it's
a lie. Or a joke. The statistics of this would have to be identical
to the case you describe, for such a thing to work. Different ages

One problem I think I have with structuralism, and some writers who
use structuralism, is that they've picked up the Continental habit of
making abstractions out to be _things_. This tends to throw me off,
especially if they combine literature with science (I once picked up a
much-cited book, supposedly on cultural implications of modern
science, and wanted to throw it across the room because I felt what it
said about science made absolutely no sense). I tend to think of
abstractions as non-things, somehow, and of similar theories as
similar ways of talking about different things, not as one way of
talking about similar things. It's possible this is just a language
problem for me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your point sounds logical to me. Still, someone like Crowley might

Well, aren't &quot;more than 50% are [whatever]&quot; and &quot;[whatever] is the

I don't really see what in Shakespeare means he has to have been a
polymath, actually. Maybe he just had an excellent memory for trivial
facts, and a tendency to make too many mental connections between
things that actually were unrelated. (In addition to the poetic and
dramatic talent.)

&gt; There wasn't room for a thousand Dickenses,

&gt; 'entertainment industry' of his day, and there
&gt; wasn't room for even one additional Dickens.

"/>

I disagree (respectfully). I think there may well have been other
&quot;Dickenses.&quot; There was, by definition, only one top best-seller.
There was, by definition, only one writer whom a particular elite
liked best, and only one writer whom another particular elite liked
best. There is, by definition, only one writer whom, by consensus,
present-day scholars of the time conclude was liked best by some third
elite. There is, by definition, only one writer who wrote about the
French Revolution in _precisely_ the way Dickens did. You make it
sound like there were pre-defined slots or something -- 1842 (or
whenever), time for a new great novelist.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If Tom Cruise had died at the age of 15, then
&gt; some other actor(s) would have filled that
&gt; space. In Dickens had died at 15, then some
&gt; other writer(s) would have (more-or-less)
&gt; filled that place. It might even have been the
&gt; case that the dominance of Dickens kept out
&gt; other writers who could have been better
&gt; than him.

"/>

But whether and how this happens is different in different times and
different places, and also for different people. It might have kept
out a contemporary John Grisham, but not a contemporary Stephen King,
or the reverse, perhaps for no reason other than the mood of a
particular editor on a particular day. It might even be the case
(surely it is!) that Dickens's dominance forced his contemporaries to
be better than they might otherwise have been.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But Shakespeare did not have to exist. If he
&gt; had died at 15, subsequent English literature
&gt; and English theatre could have had all the life
&gt; and vigour of, say, the Swiss, the Danish,
&gt; Dutch, Albanian, German, Portuguese, etc., etc.

"/>

Maybe. Maybe not. I can speculate that &quot;if Washington Irving had not
written parodies of E.T.A. Hoffmann, Mark Twain's attack on J.
Fenimore Cooper (who wrote the Leatherstocking Tales) likely would
have been less successful, and succeeding American literature would
have been different than it was.&quot; But, on the other hand, literature
in Cooper's general style continued and was popular, among many
readers if not among the literary elite, so I might concede that
that's questionable. (This may be a misleading comparison. American
literature differs from English literature in having had a
long-lasting inferiority complex, regarding the &quot;Mother Country,&quot;
until really very recently.) No one _had_ to exist. But no
particular consequence had to follow, either, in either case.

I guess I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here, but I think my
overall view of how things fit together is different from what you
express above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a good question, Tom, and my answer would be that one must
have
&gt;&gt;&gt; brilliance to be the kind of writer that Dickens was, and
thousands didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; have that brilliance or genius, but that doesn't negate my
statement that
&gt;&gt;&gt; his books parallel his life experiences and his interests, and so
it is easy
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see that he wrote the books attributed to him.

&gt;&gt; A bit of circular logic.

So try an experiment. Mess with the literature on Dickens and see
what happens to literary biographies of the man, as a result. [:-)]

| similar ways of talking about different things, not as one way of
| talking about similar things. It's possible this is just a language

We had a go-around at h.l.a.s. about structuralism a couple years ago,
when a student wanted to know about Shakespeare's fools in terms of an
evolving cultural context featuring fools. Evidently, her idea was
that the abstract fool in its cultural context, manifest in
Shakespeare's fool, is recognized as real, sort of with a life of its
own; plus, you could analyze the make-up of fools' characteristics in
terms of social developments, etc.; if I understand correctly. All
that goes to understanding ways text can be investigated, as well as
the biographical, pragmatic, memetic, etc.. And when we read, we are
getting not only the author's message, or our own, but concepts
manifest from media and culture. It gets too &quot;off the wall&quot;/abstract
for me about the time they claim politics is involved.

| &gt; Your point sounds logical to me. Still, someone like Crowley
might
| &gt; continue by commenting that &quot;some nerd from an average family
could
| &gt; never be a polymath like Shakespeare, because &quot;average&quot; means
dumbed
| &gt; down to the lowest common denomenator.&quot; bb
|
| Well, aren't &quot;more than 50% are [whatever]&quot; and &quot;[whatever] is the
| average&quot; the same thing? :=)
|
| I don't really see what in Shakespeare means he has to have been a
| polymath, actually. Maybe he just had an excellent memory for
trivial
| facts, and a tendency to make too many mental connections between
| things that actually were unrelated. (In addition to the poetic and
| dramatic talent.)

It's a lot of fun to speculate what Shakespeare's endowments were,
IMO. You might say he was like a Zen Master for the way he excelled
at acting, playwrighting, poetry, and theater business; plus the
abstract way he looks at human nature. Looking at the details he puts
in plays, including birds, plants and flowers, human pecadillos,
astronomy, astrology, music, classical echoes, borrowings from
literature, law, naval matters, business, farming, esoteric lore,
etc., I assume he was a Renaissance Man interested in everything anew.
His insights into character and psychology make me think he was a sort
of empath.

Absence from his comprehensive survey of the human condition is
religion, which makes me think he had philosophy, monkish quietism,
and intellect to compensate. Recently, I came upon a criticism of
Shakespear that, although he had utopian leanings, he lacked a
&quot;positive creed&quot;; according to Bernard Shaw, possily caused by the
influence of Montaigne, who &quot;perverted his mind&quot; (v. *Shakespeare and
Montaigne*, by Jacob Feis, in Jaques Barzun, *From Dawn to
Decadence*). bb

You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted a

Careful. I have already said that Polonius' name was originally Corambis,
quite likely a play on Cor unum, via una, Burghley's Latin motto. It was
changed in the next quarto and the Folio. I was going to bring up the

I haven't read the play for a while, but seem to remember him being told,

he was certainly, like Cecil, garrulous, and the rebuke could only be seen

&gt;&gt; We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated,

&gt;&gt; to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and is so
&gt;&gt; cultured, so educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him
&gt;&gt;&quot;all cat-knowledge is his province&quot;; also, take a mouse. Lock the
&gt;&gt; three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half an
&gt;&gt; hour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian,
&gt;&gt; and let them cipher and assume. The mouse is missing: the question to
&gt;&gt; be decided is, where is it? You can guess both verdicts beforehand.
&gt;&gt; One verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as
&gt;&gt; certainly say the mouse is in the tomcat.

&gt;&gt; The Shakespearite will Reason like this--(that is not my word,
&gt;&gt; it is his). He will say the kitten may have been attending school when
&gt;&gt; nobody was noticing; therefore we are warranted in assuming that it
&gt;&gt; did so; also, it could have been training in a court-clerk's office
&gt;&gt; when no one was noticing; since that could have happened, we are
&gt;&gt; justified in assuming that it did happen; it could have studied
&gt;&gt; catology in a garret when no one was noticing--therefore it did; it
&gt;&gt; could have attended cat-assizes on the shedroof nights, for
&gt;&gt; recreation, when no one was noticing, and harvested a knowledge of cat
&gt;&gt; court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way: it could have done it,
&gt;&gt; therefore without a doubt it did; it could have gone soldiering with a
&gt;&gt; war-tribe when no one was noticing, and learned soldierwiles and
&gt;&gt; soldier-ways, and what to do with a mouse when opportunity offers; the
&gt;&gt; plain inference, therefore is, that that is what it did. Since all
&gt;&gt; these manifold things could have occurred, we have every right to
&gt;&gt; believe they did occur. These patiently and painstakingly accumulated
&gt;&gt; vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing
&gt;&gt; more--opportunity--to convert themselves into triumphant action. The

'John Fisher' (Master FJ) went with Philip Sidney to Europe in 1572.
They were in Paris at the time of 'The Massacre at Paris' and they
reached Venice in November, 1573, where they were entertained
by the 'Merchants of Venice' {DING!}. 'John Fisher' was an early alias
for WILL PIERCE/WILL KEMPE and when Sancho Pança and Don
Quixote returned to England, in May, 1575, they vowed to recreate
Arcadia.

They did recreate Arcadia in Southern England, but you will have to read
the works of the concealed poet as 'Edmund Spenser' if you want the
details.

'Robert Greene' was another of the concealed poet's pseudonyms,
Art. He was 'Mercury' aka 'Odin' remember? Over 250 aliases. On
my web-page, which you say you have read, I actually posted --
&quot;Writing about himself under another pseudonym, 'Robert Greene',
Will revealed that he had a (etc, etc)&quot;, so there has been no attempt
to confuse you.

'Robert Greene' had to be disposed of in 1592 because he had got
into trouble for exposing con artists. That's when Will 'invented' Gervase
Markham.

Don't get frustrated with me, Art. All of my postings are on topic -- the
authorship problem. That quotation describes the little man who wrote
the 'Shakespeare' works and loads of others. I am giving you the MOST
reliable information on hlas -- because it's the truth :-)

When one of Will Pierce's stepfathers died, in 1588, he left Will
nothing but a groat with which to buy himself some wit. This man
had been a usurer and Will had lectured him on his evil ways. Will
decided to write plays in order to make money -- and the rest is
history!

&gt;&gt; We know what happened when important Elizabethans

&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted a
&gt; possibility: that Hamlet may have been written by someone who was beyond
&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

"/>

It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely
writing Polonius's lines, Burghley was dead, but
I'm not sure that it matters much. His son appears
to have had about the same level of influence, so
the rest of the argument would seem to cover pretty
much the same ground.

So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters
to the Cecils askingfor help at court, deliberately blackened
Burghley's reputation on stage. That does seem rather
insulting.

I suppose a hothead might burn a bridge. But then I
also suppose most hotheads know that after they've
burned the bridge, they need to either repair it
or forget about asking forhelp. If Oxford were
Shakespeare and if he, as you believe, had grossly
insulted Burghley, I'd expect him to have either
rewritten Polonius to the point where he was no
longer an insult to Burghley every time the play was
staged or I'd expect him to have stopped writing
those letters asking for assistence.

You believe the parallels to be obvious enough to make them
a virtual certainty. If that were truly the case, then
most Elizabethans would surely have understood exactly what
was what.

The play required a license for performance. Given
what we know about the relative influences at Court of
the de Vere's and the Cecils, what are chances that
Tilney would have thought that de Vere's good will
was worth more than that of the Cecils's?

What are the chances that an acting company would
perform such a play with out a license?

What are the chances that the acting company, performing
an unlicensed play insulting the second most powerful
man in the kingdom, would not have gotten into hot
water?

Why don't we see some indication in the record that the
players had some legal troubles in the matter?

Would the Cecils have been happy with such a play
being printed? Obviously not. Would they have tried
to suppress it? Almost certainly. How would they have
done that? They'd have contacted the Stationers Company
directly and we'd see a note in the Stationers Register
about how the play was not to be printed until further
notice. If they had been overruled, we'd see a note
saying that some authority had authorized the printing.
Do we see such references in the SR?

An insult to the Cecils in a play would have been
something the literati would have talked about.
Do we see any mention of the affair in any of the
extant gossip from the era?

etc. etc.

In short: de Vere would have been a fool to insult
the people he was depending upon to argue his case
at Court, the actors would have been fools to
present an insult to the Cecils on stage, Tilney
would have been a fool to license a play insulting
the Cecils, the Stationers would have been fools
to regard de Vere as more powerful than the Cecils,
and/or the Cecils would have been fools to have taken
a serious public delivered insult lying down.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why was no one tossed
&gt; in jail for Richard II either?

"/>

I would be suprised if the players weren't worried
about that happening, however, we have the sworn testimony
in the matter and none of the rebels appears to have
implicated either the author or the players. Phillips
testified that the play was old which mean that it
had been written long before Essex started thinking
about rebellion. I think we can assume that the play
was properly licensed or the actors almost certainly
would have gone to jail. The fact that they could
call themselves the Lord Chamberlain's Men probably
didn't hurt.

Why is this not an even more serious question for
Oxfordians? It is not as if de Vere was never tossed
into jail.

Who do you think presented a larger danger to the
Queen: commoners encouraging rebellion or nobles
encouraging rebellion? Who would be more likely to
seen as encouraging rebellion: an affluent middleclass
man or an obviously discontented nobleman?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Quartos were suppressed.
&gt;&gt; Names of characters were changed.(eg. Oldcastle to Falstaff).

&gt; Careful. I have already said that Polonius' name was originally Corambis,
&gt; quite likely a play on Cor unum, via una, Burghley's Latin motto.

"/>

Likely?

Here's what Terry Ross wrote back in 1998 in response
to a Mark Alexander argument on the issue:

--- Start quote from Terry ---

Sometimes Mark thinks his interpretation of &quot;Corambis&quot; as meaning
&quot;double-hearted&quot; is a &quot;strong&quot; argument, but his explanation of his
&quot;Z-zxis&quot; is somewhat more tentative.

With &quot;cor&quot; meaning &quot;heart&quot; and with &quot;bis&quot; or &quot;ambis&quot; meaning &quot;twice&quot;
or &quot;double&quot; (think &quot;ambidextrous&quot;), Corambis in Latin then implies
&quot;double-hearted.&quot;

While &quot;cor&quot; is Latin for heart, &quot;ambis&quot; doesn't exactly mean &quot;twice.&quot;
There is an adjective &quot;ambo&quot; meaning &quot;both,&quot; so I &quot;cordes amba&quot; could mean
&quot;two hearts.&quot; The dative or ablative plural would be &quot;cordis ambis,&quot;
which is getting closer. In English we say of two lovers that their two
hearts beat as one, and maybe some of that could be conveyed by &quot;cordis
ambis,&quot; but I don't know how to get &quot;deceitful&quot; from the phrase. In any
event, I would expect a name or other word formed on &quot;cor&quot; to be formed
on the genitive, and thus to include &quot;cord&quot; rather than just &quot;cor&quot;; and I
would expect the part of the word that signals doubleness to come first
(as in &quot;bicornis&quot; = &quot;two-horned,&quot; or &quot;bicorpor&quot; = &quot;two-bodied&quot;; as Mark
says, think &quot;ambidextrous&quot;).

There is a verb form &quot;ambis&quot; meaning &quot;you go around,&quot; but that doesn't
seem very helpful.

&quot;Bis&quot; does mean &quot;twice,&quot; but if we take the name as &quot;coram bis&quot; then
&quot;coram&quot; would seem to be the adverb meaning &quot;face to face.&quot; Put them
together and you might have &quot;coram bis&quot; = &quot;face-to-face twice,&quot; as in &quot;I
never saw Ronald Reagan but I have twice met Jimmy Carter face to face.&quot;

If &quot;Corambis&quot; does mean anything in Latin, perhaps the answer may be found
in the cabbage patch. In addition to the &quot;crambe bis&quot; that Richard found
in the Arden, there were such variants of &quot;crambe&quot; as &quot;coramble&quot; and
&quot;corambla,&quot; so we could have the dative or ablative plural &quot;coramblis&quot;
(&quot;for cabbages,&quot;&quot;by cabbages,&quot; or something of the sort).

If his &quot;Z-axis&quot; is to be more than a zero, then it should be the case that
anyone with a sufficient knowledge of Latin would interpret the name the
way he wants us to. My knowledge of Latin is weaker than it should be,
but when I looked for a Latin sense I saw &quot;coram bis.&quot; Mark says, &quot;Since
every accomplished Shakespeare editor is also accomplished in Latin, it is
amazing that none seem to have perceived, even without the motto
connection, that Corambis would indicate a 'double-hearted' (i.e.,
deceitful) character.&quot; Look at it he other way, Mark: if they don't read
&quot;Corambis&quot; the way you want to, perhaps it's because &quot;Corambis&quot; does not
imply &quot;deceitful.&quot; Where is the demonstration that &quot;Corambis&quot; would have
carried such a meaning for anyone in 1600?

--- end of quote from Terry ---

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It was
&gt; changed in the next quarto and the Folio. I was going to bring up the
&gt; Oldcastle parallel to show names might be changed to avoid very public
&gt; insult of real people, but decided it wasn't necessary.

"/>

It shows that a powerful man concerned about the reputation of a
an ancestor who died about two centuries earlier could force a
change to a Shakespeare play. You and many other Oxfordians
believe an even more powerful man was unable to keep an extremely
unflattering portrait of his father in a Shakespeare play off
the stage and out of print.

Is that a fair characterization?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That we don't see any of that happening with Hamlet,

&gt; See above.

&gt;&gt; indicates that either Robert and Thomas Cecil didn't
&gt;&gt; see the parallels as significant or they didn't see
&gt;&gt; Polonius as particularly insulting.

&gt; See above.
&gt;&gt; (Polonius does
&gt;&gt; not have to be played as a doddering old fool.)

&gt; I haven't read the play for a while, but seem to remember him being told,
&gt;&quot;More matter with less art.&quot; In other words he might not be doddering, but
&gt; he was certainly, like Cecil, garrulous, and the rebuke could only be seen
&gt; as insulting.

"/>

Before I assume that Burghley was known to his contemporaries
as being a garrulous man, I'd like to see evidence that at least
one contemporary said or wrote something about him along those
lines. (And no, the content of his advice to his sons does
not demonstrate that he was thought of as particularly
garrulous.)

Being told to get to the point seems a pretty slight insult.

Wolsey was the son of a butcher and cattle dealer. He had a
relatively comfortable upbringing and was educated at Magdalen
College, Oxford University.

Wolsey decided on a life devoted to God and he joined the church.
He held a number of private chaplainries but he soon came to the
attention of Henry VII as Wolsey was quickly identified as a man who
had excellent managerial skills with a very good grasp of detail.
Wolsey was also a very keen worker. In 1507, he was appointed Henry

&gt;&gt; I first read of this idea in an article, in *Esquire*

&gt;&gt; great story, but I assumed that a closer look at the
&gt;&gt; facts would reveal it to be the foolishness that it
&gt;&gt; clearly had to be. That was some forty years ago,
&gt;&gt; however, and having looked at the facts as closely as
&gt;&gt; anyone can have done since then, I still cannot fault
&gt;&gt; the theory, and much that I have found does in fact
&gt;&gt; strongly support it. Although Calvin Hoffman's original
&gt;&gt; argument was deeply flawed, and those of others since
&gt;&gt; him often not much better, I nevertheless now find it
&gt;&gt; far more likely that the basic theory is right than
&gt;&gt; that it is not.

&gt;&gt; If you are interested in further information, there
&gt;&gt; is plenty on my web-site, at the address given below.

&gt; Thanks. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to make of it,

Why on earth not? You seem to be an intelligent person
with a good grasp of English, which should be all that
is required.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; In your opinion, what in particular do
&gt;&gt;&gt; you find difficult to relate to Shakespeare's life?

&gt;&gt; The *range* of interests, ideas, associations, viewpoints
&gt;&gt; and images expressed and of words used. For me, this could
&gt;&gt; come only from a wide experience of life and a very highly
&gt;&gt; educated, well-travelled, influential, inquisitive, chall-
&gt;&gt; enging and artistic circle of friends and acquaintances.
&gt;&gt; We find nothing to indicate *anything* like this in Shake-
&gt;&gt; speare's biography.

&gt; But in most times, this kind of experience and society are
&gt; often found in theatre circles in large urban centers.

"/>

Even if I agreed with you (which I don't) do you have any
evidence at all that this was so in the 16th/17th centuries?
The kind of people I am talking about are not only other
'University wits', but also the leading statesmen, courtiers,
philosophers, explorers, scientists, physicians, astronomers,
lawyers, musicians and artists of the day. I see no evidence
whatsoever to suggest that Shakespeare ever moved in
such circles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have a difficult time trying to imagine what you
&gt; think is missing (much less why you think it's more
&gt; likely present for Marlowe than for William Shakespeare).

"/>

There is evidence to suggest that Marlowe was connected,
whether directly or indirectly, with such people, mainly
through the ('Wizard') Earl of Northumberland and Sir
Walter Ralegh, and the group said to congregate around
them. This was only during what we know of Marlowe's
life, of course. Although anything that happened after his
possibly faked death must be speculation, it has to include
continuing to mix with people like this, with the addition
of travel throughout Europe, experiencing the best of
what the European Renaissance had to offer. It is my
opinion, and that is all, that simply being amongst the
actors and the Stratfordian intelligentsia would not have
been enough to nurture the mind we see exhibited in the
works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I really don't have much &quot;feel&quot; for what the records of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time are like. Was England, at that time, a place where
&gt;&gt;&gt; good, modern-style accurate records were being kept, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; was it still pretty medieval?

&gt;&gt; Those records which were required for legal reasons have
&gt;&gt; survived relatively well, whereas more personal documents,
&gt;&gt; such as private correspondence, has survived only in few
&gt;&gt; cases. You'll find a very good chapter on this at
&gt;&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/survival.html

&gt; Thanks. One reason I asked is that I know for the
&gt; period not long before this, most &quot;primary source&quot;
&gt; research is done from digests, not from the records
&gt; themselves.

"/>

For the period in question, the digests produced by
the Historical Manuscripts Commission, for example, are
very useful, but I have never found any difficulty in
getting access to the original documents when I needed
to, even though I am only an amateur, unconnected with
any learned institution. For some items, of course, a
transcript (or digest) produced by someone else can be
sufficient, and certainly saves time.

&gt; In the United States, we expect the government to

&gt; I've gathered that in Britain, the government seems to
&gt; keep a tighter hold over archives.

I am aware of no such impediment related to the time we
are talking about, although I got no response when I
asked the current Coroner to the Queen's Household if
there was a separate collection of the documents related
to his office going back as far as that, and I suspect
there may be.

Yes, unless someone happened to stumble across it, as I

&gt; This was a thought I had, reading Rowse's book on the

&gt; had resulted in a lot of personal creativity, which

&gt; or painted it, or composed madrigals incorporating it,
&gt; but which we really can't interpret today.

Some hidden messages were intended to be solved only
by the author. Galileo, for example, used cipher to
claim priority for a discovery before he was ready to
publish it, and some diarists have written everything
in a cryptic form.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The problem I generally have with arguments about
&gt;&quot;secret messages&quot; is that perhaps the decoded message
&gt; is, itself, in code. Or perhaps it's a lie. Or a
&gt; joke. The statistics of this would have to be identical
&gt; to the case you describe, for such a thing to work.
&gt; Different ages had differing ideas about the use of
&gt; symbolic references.

"/>

Tom Veal made a similar point (about the possibility of
it being a lie) earlier on in this thread, and I agreed.
No hidden message on its own can prove anything.

Something else has become clearer to me while discussing
these things, but I think I'll give it a new thread in
a day or two.

I'm afraid I don't have the figures in front of me; however, for a
fuller discussion of who agreed or disagreed, you might like to go to

That is part one of Mark Alexander's argument. Parts two and three are
also available, linked from the first page. And part four contains
counter arguments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; We know what happened when important Elizabethans
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that they were disrespected in a play.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actors and/or playwrights were tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted a
&gt;&gt; possibility: that Hamlet may have been written by someone who was beyond
&gt;&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

&gt; It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely
&gt; writing Polonius's lines, Burghley was dead, but
&gt; I'm not sure that it matters much.

"/>

Actually, it matters quite a lot. I hope you won't mind my presenting
another person's argument here, that of someone from the Fellowship
site:

&quot;It matters a great deal, of course. Hamlet's dating is a big key.
Burghley died in '98, but when Thomas Nashe spoke of 'whole Hamlets'
in his preface to Greene's Menaphon, it was '89 and Burghley was very
much alive. The [orthodox] argument is that this wasn't Shakespeare's
Hamlet. They have no answer, however, for the question, who was this
'English Seneca' of whom Nashe spoke, who, &quot;if you entreat him fair of
a frosty morning, [he] will afford you whole Hamlets, or should I say
handfulls of tragical speeches?&quot; Was the play so much a part of
theatrical culture that it could be referenced that easily? Easy to
believe about the play Hamlet that we know. Of course this is a
non-starter for the [orthodox], WS couldn't have written this Hamlet.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;His son appears
&gt; to have had about the same level of influence, so
&gt; the rest of the argument would seem to cover pretty
&gt; much the same ground.

&gt; So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters
&gt; to the Cecils askingfor help at court, deliberately blackened
&gt; Burghley's reputation on stage. That does seem rather
&gt; insulting.

"/>

First, I would say that family relationships are often fraught with
ambivalence. Would you argue with that? I have many examples. Oxford
had been both the ward and son in law of Burghley and the
relationship, as we all know, was not an easy one.

Second, it is possible that Oxford used a pseudonym so that those &quot;in
the know&quot; or inner circles would know, but those who weren't, would
not.

Third, Polonius, as one actor said to me, is &quot;a dream of a part.&quot; It
has its scathing moments when he is shown to be conniving, wordy, and
(possibly) doddering, but he is also revealed as a senior statesman of
some importance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I suppose a hothead might burn a bridge. But then I
&gt; also suppose most hotheads know that after they've
&gt; burned the bridge, they need to either repair it
&gt; or forget about asking forhelp. If Oxford were
&gt; Shakespeare and if he, as you believe, had grossly
&gt; insulted Burghley, I'd expect him to have either
&gt; rewritten Polonius to the point where he was no
&gt; longer an insult to Burghley every time the play was
&gt; staged or I'd expect him to have stopped writing
&gt; those letters asking for assistence.

"/>

And the truth hinges on your expectation?

As the same Fellowship member stated: &quot;notice the use of word 'insult'
as opposed to caricature. Of course, timing is everything. Maybe the
late revisions of Hamlet came about when De Vere didn't get the
assistance he sought. The theme of disinheritance might have been
strong with him throughout his life, and certainly Burghley played a
large part in that.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You believe the parallels to be obvious enough to make them
&gt; a virtual certainty. If that were truly the case, then
&gt; most Elizabethans would surely have understood exactly what
&gt; was what.

"/>

Most Elizabethans &quot;in the know&quot; or inner circle would have understood
what was what, yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The play required a license for performance. Given
&gt; what we know about the relative influences at Court of
&gt; the de Vere's and the Cecils, what are chances that
&gt; Tilney would have thought that de Vere's good will
&gt; was worth more than that of the Cecils's?

"/>

I'm not sure of the answer to that. Another fellowship member
suggested: &quot;It [is important to] pause long enough to consider the
implications of the claim that the plays were published under a
pseudonym. Surely, if the plays had been published under de Vere's own
name, then the parallels between Cecil and Burghley would indeed have
been obvious to many readers. The purpose of pseudonymous authorship,
as I construe it, was in fact to cast a veil over the local landmarks
which would allow readers to easily make such associations between the
characters of the play and persons of de Vere's own life. The question
presupposes that Cecil -- whether William or Robert -- had a
controlling power interest in determing the performance and
publication of the play. Clearly, however, Elizabethan and Jacobean
England were societies with contending power factions. Tilney, and Buc
after him, were beholden less to the Cecils than to the Herberts.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; What are the chances that an acting company would
&gt; perform such a play with out a license?

&gt; What are the chances that the acting company, performing
&gt; an unlicensed play insulting the second most powerful
&gt; man in the kingdom, would not have gotten into hot
&gt; water?

"/>

I would say that's the whole point, Rob. They didn't get into hot
water because the author wasn't William Shakespeare of Stratford, and
those in the inner circle knew that. How many nobles, after all, were
thrown into jail for writing plays compared to middle-class writers?
Of course, this is an iffy argument. We're not exactly sure how many
nobles were actually writing plays, with the notable exception of
Derby.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Why don't we see some indication in the record that the
&gt; players had some legal troubles in the matter?

"/>

See above. Perhaps the author was so high born that he was immune. I
still think it's very strange that no one, for example, went to jail
for Richard II, when Elizabeth openly compared herself to the deposed
monarch. If people were questioned for it, why wasn't Shakespeare of
Stratford, the supposed playwright?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Would the Cecils have been happy with such a play
&gt; being printed? Obviously not. Would they have tried
&gt; to suppress it? Almost certainly. How would they have
&gt; done that? They'd have contacted the Stationers Company
&gt; directly and we'd see a note in the Stationers Register
&gt; about how the play was not to be printed until further
&gt; notice. If they had been overruled, we'd see a note
&gt; saying that some authority had authorized the printing.
&gt; Do we see such references in the SR?

&gt; An insult to the Cecils in a play would have been
&gt; something the literati would have talked about.
&gt; Do we see any mention of the affair in any of the
&gt; extant gossip from the era?

&gt; etc. etc.

&gt; In short: de Vere would have been a fool to insult
&gt; the people he was depending upon to argue his case
&gt; at Court, the actors would have been fools to
&gt; present an insult to the Cecils on stage, Tilney
&gt; would have been a fool to license a play insulting
&gt; the Cecils, the Stationers would have been fools
&gt; to regard de Vere as more powerful than the Cecils,
&gt; and/or the Cecils would have been fools to have taken
&gt; a serious public delivered insult lying down.

&gt;&gt; Why was no one tossed
&gt;&gt; in jail for Richard II either?

&gt; I would be suprised if the players weren't worried
&gt; about that happening, however, we have the sworn testimony
&gt; in the matter and none of the rebels appears to have
&gt; implicated either the author or the players. Phillips
&gt; testified that the play was old which mean that it
&gt; had been written long before Essex started thinking
&gt; about rebellion. I think we can assume that the play
&gt; was properly licensed or the actors almost certainly
&gt; would have gone to jail. The fact that they could
&gt; call themselves the Lord Chamberlain's Men probably
&gt; didn't hurt.

"/>

I'm not sure we can assume anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Why is this not an even more serious question for
&gt; Oxfordians? It is not as if de Vere was never tossed
&gt; into jail.

"/>

He was tossed into jail by the queen for what she considered
iniquitous or immoral behaviour. Others, commoners, got into trouble
for writing plays which appeared to have an element which might
encourage rebellion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Who do you think presented a larger danger to the
&gt; Queen: commoners encouraging rebellion or nobles
&gt; encouraging rebellion? Who would be more likely to
&gt; seen as encouraging rebellion: an affluent middleclass
&gt; man or an obviously discontented nobleman?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Quartos were suppressed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Names of characters were changed.(eg. Oldcastle to Falstaff).

&gt;&gt; Careful. I have already said that Polonius' name was originally Corambis,
&gt;&gt; quite likely a play on Cor unum, via una, Burghley's Latin motto.

&gt; Likely?

you have deliberately altered texts that you have supposedly quoted,
Art. Here's an excerpt from one of my posts on one of the occasions
when you were guilty of deliberate misquotation:
------------------------------------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;&lt;Freemason (B)enedict (A)rnold came to Ridgefield in April of 1777
&gt; to fight the British who had landed at Compo Beach at Westport, Conn.,
&gt; and marched north to Danbury, where the Redcoats burned many homes and
&gt; community buildings. On their way back to the sea, the troops passed
&gt; through Ridgefield where General Arnold and General David Wooster,
&gt; leading local militia, attacked. Arnold's horse was shot out from under
&gt; him on the Main Street of Ridgefield, but he continued to fight. Wooster
&gt; was wounded along the North Salem Road (now Route 116). Wooster's son,
&gt; protecting his father, refused to surrender and was run through with a
&gt; sword, killing him instantly. General Wooster was taken to Danbury where
&gt; he died a few days later, aged 66. Professor James Kirby Martin, in
&gt; Benedict Arnold, Revolutionary Hero: An American Warrior Reconsidered
&gt; (New York University Press, 1997), devotes several pages to Arnold's
&gt; participation in British General Tryon's raid on Danbury and the Battle
&gt; of Ridgefield, using it to point out Arnold's bravery and strong
&gt; leadership qualities, but also the lackluster support the patriot
&gt; general got from the militia and citizenry of our part of Connecticut.

&gt; Here's a portion of the the book's description of the Battle of
&gt; Ridgefield on northern Main Street at Casagmo:

"/>

[Rest of the &quot;quotation&quot; snipped]

Well, Art, I see that, not content with merely inventing things for
which you can supply no evidence, you have descended to a new low
unworthy even of you: intentionally distorting a quotation without
indicating the alteration. Here's the URL for the quotation above:

&lt;&gt;

The quotation does *not* read &quot;Freemason Benedict Arnold,&quot; but rather
&quot;General Benedict Arnold.&quot; There is no suggestion that the author of
the quotation is a paranoid conspiracy theorist, as your contemptible
alteration might suggest. Arnold was a Freemason, but nobody (except
perhaps a demented conspiracy theorist) would regard that fact as
remotely germane to a discussion of Arnold's defense of Ridgefield.
-------------------------------------------------------
The online text that you misquoted is still available at

&lt;&gt;;

the post in which you deliberately misquoted it can be found in the
Google archives at

&lt;&gt;.

But perhaps you're right after all about one thing, Art -- you and
Zenner *are* exact opposites. Zenner has neVER, to my knowledge,
*deliberately* misquoted anyone (and even if he had, he would be readily
absolved on the basis of the Elizabeth Weird Indemnification Clause);
you, on the other hand, alter quotations quite routinely. On the other
hand, if you want to plead that the Elizabeth Weird Indemnification
Clause applies to aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut, then I doubt that
many people would gainsay you, Art.

Philip Sidney (1554-86) had gallantly refused to 'Don' thigh armour
(cuisses or 'Quixote') when an elder knight didn't have any(; did
Philip, in fact, loan his cuisses to that elderly knight). Sidney
was shot in the thigh on Sept. 22, 1586 and died on October 17.

'Quixote' is Spanish for thigh armour and it was his thigh armour
that Philip Sidney famously failed to don at the battle of Zutphen.

Philip Sidney = Don Quixote.

'Sancio' (the 'c' is pronounced 'ch') is Latin for 'to enact a punishment
against' and 'Pansa' is Latin for 'splayfoot'. 'Will Kempe', one of the
names used by the concealed poet, was a splayfoot -- as well as
having a &quot;back like a lute and his face like Thirsites, his eyes broad
and tawny, his hair harsh and curled like a horse's mane, his lips were
of the largest size in folio, able to furnish a Cobbler's shop with clouting
leather. The only good part that he had to grace his visage was his nose,
and that was conqueror like, as beaked as an Eagle. Nature having made
so proper a stripling, thought his inward qualities should not blemish
his outward excellence, and therefore to keep proportion into his
great head she put little wit, that he knew rather his sheep by
the mark than the number, for he was never no good Arithmetician,
and yet he was a proper scholar and well seen in Ditties.&quot;

&gt; you have deliberately altered texts that you have supposedly quoted,
&gt; Art. Here's an excerpt from one of my posts on one of the occasions
&gt; when you were guilty of deliberate misquotation:
&gt; ------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Freemason (B)enedict (A)rnold came to Ridgefield in April of 1777
&gt;&gt; to fight the British who had landed at Compo Beach at Westport, Conn.,
&gt;&gt; and marched north to Danbury, where the Redcoats burned many homes and
&gt;&gt; community buildings. On their way back to the sea, the troops passed
&gt;&gt; through Ridgefield where General Arnold and General David Wooster,
&gt;&gt; leading local militia, attacked. Arnold's horse was shot out from under
&gt;&gt; him on the Main Street of Ridgefield, but he continued to fight. Wooster
&gt;&gt; was wounded along the North Salem Road (now Route 116). Wooster's son,
&gt;&gt; protecting his father, refused to surrender and was run through with a
&gt;&gt; sword, killing him instantly. General Wooster was taken to Danbury where
&gt;&gt; he died a few days later, aged 66. Professor James Kirby Martin, in
&gt;&gt; Benedict Arnold, Revolutionary Hero: An American Warrior Reconsidered
&gt;&gt; (New York University Press, 1997), devotes several pages to Arnold's
&gt;&gt; participation in British General Tryon's raid on Danbury and the Battle
&gt;&gt; of Ridgefield, using it to point out Arnold's bravery and strong
&gt;&gt; leadership qualities, but also the lackluster support the patriot
&gt;&gt; general got from the militia and citizenry of our part of Connecticut.

&gt;&gt; Here's a portion of the the book's description of the Battle of
&gt;&gt; Ridgefield on northern Main Street at Casagmo:

&gt; [Rest of the &quot;quotation&quot; snipped]

&gt; Well, Art, I see that, not content with merely inventing things for
&gt; which you can supply no evidence, you have descended to a new low
&gt; unworthy even of you: intentionally distorting a quotation without
&gt; indicating the alteration. Here's the URL for the quotation above:

&gt;&lt;http://www.acorn-online.com/arnold.htm&gt;

&gt; The quotation does *not* read &quot;Freemason Benedict Arnold,&quot; but rather
&gt;&quot;General Benedict Arnold.&quot; There is no suggestion that the author of
&gt; the quotation is a paranoid conspiracy theorist, as your contemptible
&gt; alteration might suggest. Arnold was a Freemason, but nobody (except
&gt; perhaps a demented conspiracy theorist) would regard that fact as
&gt; remotely germane to a discussion of Arnold's defense of Ridgefield.
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------
&gt; The online text that you misquoted is still available at

&gt;&lt;http://www.acorn-online.com/arnold.htm&gt;;

&gt; the post in which you deliberately misquoted it can be found in the
&gt; Google archives at

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3B20BD66.E4D30983%40erols.com&amp;outpu
&gt; t=gplain&gt;.

&gt; But perhaps you're right after all about one thing, Art -- you and
&gt; Zenner *are* exact opposites. Zenner has neVER, to my knowledge,
&gt; *deliberately* misquoted anyone

"/>

Zenner just admitted to *deliberately* misquoting.

(and even if he had, he would be readily

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; absolved on the basis of the Elizabeth Weird Indemnification Clause);
&gt; you, on the other hand, alter quotations quite routinely.

I changed: &quot;General Benedict Arnold&quot; into &quot;Freemason Benedict Arnold&quot;
who everybody agrees are the same person.

Zenner changed: &quot;Robert Greene&quot; to &quot;William Kempe&quot;

Most unlikely. There is little point in caricaturing
dead people. And for those recently dead, it's
usually thought to be in bad taste. Do you think
the London audience around 1600 would have
found it a pleasing feature of the play?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters

The play would have been staged at court
some 20 or so years earlier -- and regarded
for what it was -- great theatre from a great
playwright-courtier, but one who was
politically harmless and from whom you

It was probably not played at all to a general
London audience.

Your expectations seem reasonable to me.
But if the reality was different, then so be it.
We have to try to put ourselves in their
places. IF you had been Burghley, and if
you had been so caricatured in court
performances (but not on the public stage)
and you appreciated the greatness of the art,
and you knew that your boss -- the Queen

Relatively few Elizabethans would have seen
the play. IF it was performed in public, no
doubt substantial excisions or amendments
were made.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The play required a license for performance. Given
&gt; what we know about the relative influences at Court of

Polonius could NOT have been seen as

I can't find anything direct on this, with a
quick search, but here is something:

&quot;Cecil himself attempted a pamphlet on the subject, entitled England
Triumphant, in which he undertook to trace the history of England's
relations to the Papacy and to show that England had never admitted
the papal supremacy. He began with the mythical Brutus of Troy,
accepted the legend of Joseph of Arimathea and designated Lucius
of Britain as the first Christian King of Britain. Cecil's style was as
bad as his history. The whole composition was a tedious, long-
winded affair. It was fortunately never published. Possibly even
Cecil got bored with it. But it reveals what became increasingly
apparent as time went on, that he had an itching hand for the pen
with no marked aptitude in the use of it.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted a

&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt; It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely

As Robert Cecil was roughly as powerful as William

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I hope you won't mind my presenting
&gt; another person's argument here, that of someone from the Fellowship
&gt; site:
&gt;&quot;It matters a great deal, of course. Hamlet's dating is a big key.
&gt; Burghley died in '98, but when Thomas Nashe spoke of 'whole Hamlets'
&gt; in his preface to Greene's Menaphon, it was '89 and Burghley was very
&gt; much alive. The [orthodox] argument is that this wasn't Shakespeare's
&gt; Hamlet.

"/>

I'm not sure it is accurate to say that that is the orthodox
argument. It would be accurate, I think, to say that the
orthodox generally argue that the Hamlet we have was largely
written by Shakespeare circa 1599. I doubt that many would argue
that we know enough about the ur-Hamlet to say we know what
was in it, let alone who wrote it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They have no answer, however, for the question, who was this
&gt; 'English Seneca' of whom Nashe spoke, who, &quot;if you entreat him fair of
&gt; a frosty morning, [he] will afford you whole Hamlets, or should I say
&gt; handfulls of tragical speeches?&quot;

"/>

I've always taken the &quot;English Seneca&quot; in that to
refer to &quot;Englished Seneca&quot;. By the time Nashe was
writing, most if not all of the Senecan plays had been
translated into English. Presumably, the ur-Hamlet was in
that genre and I imagine(based only upon Nashe) that
whoever wrote it borrowed liberally from the Seneca's
translated works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Was the play so much a part of
&gt; theatrical culture that it could be referenced that easily? Easy to
&gt; believe about the play Hamlet that we know.

"/>

#1. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar wasn't the only Elizabethan
Caesar play. Shakespeare's Richard II wasn't the only
Elizabethan play by that name. Consider Leir or
A Shrew; the quality of writing in the two plays is
generally regarded as far too poor for Shakespeare to
be held responsible. Shakespeare appears to have
rewritten the two plays. Henslowe shows us other
dramatists doing pretty much the same thing. All
that being so, surely the names alone don't tell us
as much as we would like.

#2. I think one can reasonably presume from Nashe's mention
that the play was at least fairly well-known and probably
popular. However, there were a number of Elizabethan
playwrights capable of writing a popular play on the subject.
In particular, we know that Kyd wrote at least one popular
play in the time period under consideration. And when we
look at the sentences surrounding the quoted bit from Nashe,
we see what appear to be fairly hard hits at Kyd. We also
know that Kyd was working the Seneca genre. Therefore,
when we consider who may have written the early Hamlet,
both Shakespeare and Kyd's name must spring to mind.

#3. In 1589, Nashe appears to have considered Hamlet to be
something that any ill-educated mechanic(if he had access
to an English Seneca) could come up with. Rather than
an intellectual play, it seems to point to a popular play
probably written by someone whose scholarship Nashe didn't
respect. Either Kyd or Shakespeare might qualify as
undereducated by Nashe's standards, but I think that
Nashe wouldn't consider the play that we have *now* to
be something just *any* ill-educated dramatist could
borrow out of Seneca.

#4 How likely is it that Meres would have knowingly left
one of Shakespeare's best plays off his list? Doesn't
seem too likely to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course this is a
&gt; non-starter for the [orthodox], WS couldn't have written this Hamlet.&quot;

"/>

I doubt most reputable scholars say that Shakespeare
was definitely not responsible for some or all of
the ur-Hamlet. Why would they? (It isn't as
if we know much about Shakespeare's early career
or much about what was in the early Hamlet.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;His son appears
&gt;&gt; to have had about the same level of influence, so the rest of the
&gt;&gt; argument would seem to cover pretty much the same ground.

&gt;&gt; So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters
&gt;&gt; to the Cecils askingfor help at court, deliberately blackened
&gt;&gt; Burghley's reputation on stage. That does seem rather
&gt;&gt; insulting.

&gt; First, I would say that family relationships are often fraught with
&gt; ambivalence. Would you argue with that? I have many examples. Oxford
&gt; had been both the ward and son in law of Burghley and the
&gt; relationship, as we all know, was not an easy one.

"/>

I don't doubt that a playwright might deliberately hurt
someone they had a family relationship with. However,
the evidence is clear that Burghley frequently worked
to further Oxford's interests. It's also clear that Oxford
frequently asked him for favors. In such instances,
I don't think that it is common for people to intentionally
and publically hurt their benefactors. (In the heat of
the moment, sure, but we're talking about writing a play
which is a relatively deliberate activity.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second, it is possible that Oxford used a pseudonym so that those &quot;in
&gt; the know&quot; or inner circles would know, but those who weren't, would
&gt; not.

"/>

Let's suppose that(as you think) that knowledge that Oxford
was the author was a prerequisite for knowing that Burghley was
insultingly caricatured.

Now let's further suppose that Oxford wasn't the author. By your
reasoning, *no one* would have known that Burghley was meant to
take a hit or two.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Third, Polonius, as one actor said to me, is &quot;a dream of a part.&quot; It

&gt; some importance.

"/>

Let suppose that the Cecils thought that it might be *possible*
that some of Polonius was based upon Burghley. Let's further
suppose that they understood the Polonius character to be
a *mostly* fair portrait. Would they have taken much offence?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I suppose a hothead might burn a bridge. But then I

&gt;&gt; staged or I'd expect him to have stopped writing
&gt;&gt; those letters asking for assistence.

&gt; And the truth hinges on your expectation?

"/>

Something a bit lesser than truth, I'm afraid.
It's merely a perception of probability based
upon my understanding of human nature.

I expect that people usually act in their own
self interest. And I expect that Edward
de Vere usually knew what side of the bread
his butter was on. Could be that I'm wrong
about that last bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As the same Fellowship member stated: &quot;notice the use of word 'insult'
&gt; as opposed to caricature. Of course, timing is everything. Maybe the
&gt; late revisions of Hamlet came about when De Vere didn't get the
&gt; assistance he sought. The theme of disinheritance might have been
&gt; strong with him throughout his life, and certainly Burghley played a
&gt; large part in that.&quot;

"/>

What's certain about it? I've read Nelson's book; I don't recall
seeing any evidence that Burghley did anything to disinherit Oxford.
On the contrary, it seems that Burghley did an awful lot *for*
Oxford.

Your sense of raillery I note does not extend to what is in the humanities

It is English. Are you yourself not able to ask a more accuitous question in
English? You employ this technique of demanding something that you fail to

But DO you regard cryptography &amp; numerology pro se [Latin, not legal] as
'nutcase' subjects? I think whichever way you answer that question a logical
implication is that, of the writers and commentators we report, what did
THEY think of such subjects, and did they employ them in their work?

Right?

A Corollary is entrenched acceptance of unexamined established points of
view which might bear great investigation, and are in fact equally equivocal
to a candid mind. You have only to think of subjects 'owned' by a
discipline, which resent other disciplines 'intruding' into thier fief.

Famously this occured between Sir Norman Lockyer and the archaeology
establishment who thought Lockyer was proposing a 'nutcase' subject, whereas
today astronomy has informed the subject of megalithic studies perhaps
greater than any other contribution.

Should be be grappling here in a seeming fruitless way, I do wish to say
that I do not disagree with your considerations on properly conducted
research, but do wish to note [a meta~ level comment] that the field of
inquiry seems to be genuinely larger than is commonly admitted in this
newsgroup, and what is established is therefore not necessarily fixed, or
established evermore in the same form.

This is a very common phenomena in anthropology. What is established and
seemingly forever fixed resists 'the shock of the new', regarding it as
either abberational or temporal fad, and as 'exterior' to the field of
inquiry. And certainly, new aspects of any subject are often introduced at
their rudest level, yet may have sufficient vigor to sucessfully incorporate
themselves and consequently reconfigure the main stream.

Also consequent therefore is to determine, not so much other people's
personality as 'evident' [as you wrote above in a telling initial comment]
of the worth of their topic, but by one's own entirely natural sensibility
not to have one's settled world disturbed.

This second factor is often subjacent to a reaction to the new. I mention it
here not to have a fling at you David, but that because it is a universal
phenomenum, and of equal consideration in investigating motivation - there
is also [and always] this subjective motivation.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you disagree?

&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I don't have the figures in front of me;

&gt; I doubt very much that anyone has gone through the list of
&gt; scholars in any systematic way, so if you had had the figures
&gt; in front of you, I'd have been surprised. (I was merely
&gt; asking for your impression.

&gt;&gt; however, for a
&gt;&gt; fuller discussion of who agreed or disagreed, you might like to go to

&gt;&gt; http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/corambis.html#an...

&gt;&gt; That is part one of Mark Alexander's argument. Parts two and three are
&gt;&gt; also available, linked from the first page. And part four contains
&gt;&gt; counter arguments.

&gt; Mark's work quotes some prominent scholars but that's
&gt; not the same thing as a systematic attempt to determine
&gt; which scholars do and which do not accept the premise
&gt; that Polonius was certainly a caricature of Burghley.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We know what happened when important Elizabethans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that they were disrespected in a play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actors and/or playwrights were tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility: that Hamlet may have been written by someone who was beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing Polonius's lines, Burghley was dead, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that it matters much.

&gt;&gt; Actually, it matters quite a lot.

&gt; As Robert Cecil was roughly as powerful as William
&gt; Cecil, it seems to me that either Cecil had about the
&gt; same ability to suppress the play.

&gt;&gt; I hope you won't mind my presenting
&gt;&gt; another person's argument here, that of someone from the Fellowship
&gt;&gt; site:
&gt;&gt;&quot;It matters a great deal, of course. Hamlet's dating is a big key.
&gt;&gt; Burghley died in '98, but when Thomas Nashe spoke of 'whole Hamlets'
&gt;&gt; in his preface to Greene's Menaphon, it was '89 and Burghley was very
&gt;&gt; much alive. The [orthodox] argument is that this wasn't Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; Hamlet.

&gt; I'm not sure it is accurate to say that that is the orthodox
&gt; argument. It would be accurate, I think, to say that the
&gt; orthodox generally argue that the Hamlet we have was largely
&gt; written by Shakespeare circa 1599. I doubt that many would argue
&gt; that we know enough about the ur-Hamlet to say we know what
&gt; was in it, let alone who wrote it.

&gt;&gt; They have no answer, however, for the question, who was this
&gt;&gt; 'English Seneca' of whom Nashe spoke, who, &quot;if you entreat him fair of
&gt;&gt; a frosty morning, [he] will afford you whole Hamlets, or should I say
&gt;&gt; handfulls of tragical speeches?&quot;

&gt; I've always taken the &quot;English Seneca&quot; in that to
&gt; refer to &quot;Englished Seneca&quot;. By the time Nashe was
&gt; writing, most if not all of the Senecan plays had been
&gt; translated into English. Presumably, the ur-Hamlet was in
&gt; that genre and I imagine(based only upon Nashe) that
&gt; whoever wrote it borrowed liberally from the Seneca's
&gt; translated works.

&gt;&gt; Was the play so much a part of
&gt;&gt; theatrical culture that it could be referenced that easily? Easy to
&gt;&gt; believe about the play Hamlet that we know.

&gt; #1. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar wasn't the only Elizabethan
&gt; Caesar play. Shakespeare's Richard II wasn't the only
&gt; Elizabethan play by that name. Consider Leir or
&gt; A Shrew; the quality of writing in the two plays is
&gt; generally regarded as far too poor for Shakespeare to
&gt; be held responsible. Shakespeare appears to have
&gt; rewritten the two plays. Henslowe shows us other
&gt; dramatists doing pretty much the same thing. All
&gt; that being so, surely the names alone don't tell us
&gt; as much as we would like.

&gt; #2. I think one can reasonably presume from Nashe's mention
&gt; that the play was at least fairly well-known and probably
&gt; popular. However, there were a number of Elizabethan
&gt; playwrights capable of writing a popular play on the subject.
&gt; In particular, we know that Kyd wrote at least one popular
&gt; play in the time period under consideration. And when we
&gt; look at the sentences surrounding the quoted bit from Nashe,
&gt; we see what appear to be fairly hard hits at Kyd. We also
&gt; know that Kyd was working the Seneca genre. Therefore,
&gt; when we consider who may have written the early Hamlet,
&gt; both Shakespeare and Kyd's name must spring to mind.

&gt; #3. In 1589, Nashe appears to have considered Hamlet to be
&gt; something that any ill-educated mechanic(if he had access
&gt; to an English Seneca) could come up with. Rather than
&gt; an intellectual play, it seems to point to a popular play
&gt; probably written by someone whose scholarship Nashe didn't
&gt; respect. Either Kyd or Shakespeare might qualify as
&gt; undereducated by Nashe's standards, but I think that
&gt; Nashe wouldn't consider the play that we have *now* to
&gt; be something just *any* ill-educated dramatist could
&gt; borrow out of Seneca.

&gt; #4 How likely is it that Meres would have knowingly left
&gt; one of Shakespeare's best plays off his list? Doesn't
&gt; seem too likely to me.

&gt;&gt; Of course this is a
&gt;&gt; non-starter for the [orthodox], WS couldn't have written this Hamlet.&quot;

&gt; I doubt most reputable scholars say that Shakespeare
&gt; was definitely not responsible for some or all of
&gt; the ur-Hamlet. Why would they? (It isn't as
&gt; if we know much about Shakespeare's early career
&gt; or much about what was in the early Hamlet.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;His son appears
&gt;&gt;&gt; to have had about the same level of influence, so the rest of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument would seem to cover pretty much the same ground.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the Cecils askingfor help at court, deliberately blackened
&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's reputation on stage. That does seem rather
&gt;&gt;&gt; insulting.

&gt;&gt; First, I would say that family relationships are often fraught with
&gt;&gt; ambivalence. Would you argue with that? I have many examples. Oxford
&gt;&gt; had been both the ward and son in law of Burghley and the
&gt;&gt; relationship, as we all know, was not an easy one.

&gt; I don't doubt that a playwright might deliberately hurt
&gt; someone they had a family relationship with. However,
&gt; the evidence is clear that Burghley frequently worked
&gt; to further Oxford's interests. It's also clear that Oxford
&gt; frequently asked him for favors. In such instances,
&gt; I don't think that it is common for people to intentionally
&gt; and publically hurt their benefactors. (In the heat of
&gt; the moment, sure, but we're talking about writing a play
&gt; which is a relatively deliberate activity.)

&gt;&gt; Second, it is possible that Oxford used a pseudonym so that those &quot;in
&gt;&gt; the know&quot; or inner circles would know, but those who weren't, would
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt; Let's suppose that(as you think) that knowledge that Oxford
&gt; was the author was a prerequisite for knowing that Burghley was
&gt; insultingly caricatured.

&gt; Now let's further suppose that Oxford wasn't the author. By your
&gt; reasoning, *no one* would have known that Burghley was meant to
&gt; take a hit or two.

&gt;&gt; Third, Polonius, as one actor said to me, is &quot;a dream of a part.&quot; It
&gt;&gt; has its scathing moments when he is shown to be conniving, wordy, and
&gt;&gt; (possibly) doddering, but he is also revealed as a senior statesman of
&gt;&gt; some importance.

&gt; Let suppose that the Cecils thought that it might be *possible*
&gt; that some of Polonius was based upon Burghley. Let's further
&gt; suppose that they understood the Polonius character to be
&gt; a *mostly* fair portrait. Would they have taken much offence?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose a hothead might burn a bridge. But then I
&gt;&gt;&gt; also suppose most hotheads know that after they've
&gt;&gt;&gt; burned the bridge, they need to either repair it
&gt;&gt;&gt; or forget about asking forhelp. If Oxford were
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare and if he, as you believe, had grossly
&gt;&gt;&gt; insulted Burghley, I'd expect him to have either
&gt;&gt;&gt; rewritten Polonius to the point where he was no
&gt;&gt;&gt; longer an insult to Burghley every time the play was
&gt;&gt;&gt; staged or I'd expect him to have stopped writing
&gt;&gt;&gt; those letters asking for assistence.

&gt;&gt; And the truth hinges on your expectation?

&gt; Something a bit lesser than truth, I'm afraid.
&gt; It's merely a perception of probability based
&gt; upon my understanding of human nature.

&gt; I expect that people usually act in their own
&gt; self interest. And I expect that Edward
&gt; de Vere usually knew what side of the bread
&gt; his butter was on. Could be that I'm wrong
&gt; about that last bit.

&gt;&gt; As the same Fellowship member stated: &quot;notice the use of word 'insult'
&gt;&gt; as opposed to caricature. Of course, timing is everything. Maybe the
&gt;&gt; late revisions of Hamlet came about when De Vere didn't get the

&gt; I think whichever way you answer that question a logical

&gt; A Corollary is entrenched acceptance of unexamined established points of

&gt; Famously this occured between Sir Norman Lockyer and the archaeology

&gt; established evermore in the same form.

&gt; This is a very common phenomena [sic] in anthropology. What is established
&gt; and
&gt; seemingly forever fixed resists 'the shock of the new', regarding it as
&gt; either abberational or temporal fad, and as 'exterior' to the field of
&gt; inquiry. And certainly, new aspects of any subject are often introduced at
&gt; their rudest level, yet may have sufficient vigor to sucessfully incorporate

Anti-Stratfordian authorship theories have been around for roughly a
century and a half. Thus far none has succeeded in &quot;reconfigur[ing] the
main stream,&quot; and I see little reason, in light of the quality of the
evidence adduced by those theories' proponents, to expect that state of
affairs to change any time soon. Indeed, the extant theries, far from
possessing &quot;sufficient vigor to...reconfigure the main stream,&quot; possess
scarcely enough plausibility to impose upon the uninformed and the
credulous. Indeed, various space alien abduction scenarios have similar
evidence and many more devotees.

If some anti-Stratfordian ever presented persuasive *new* evidence,
the situation could change quite drastically, and I would be among the
first to welcome that development, if indeed the new evidence withstood
scrutiny. However, most anti-Stratfordians are engaged either in
resurrecting and recycling old, conclusively refuted rubbish (e.g., the
many Ogburn acolytes) or in devising new, readily refuted rubbish (e.g.,
Mr. Streitz, and probably Brame and Popova), neither of which activities

Thanks for reposting this one, Rob. I was just going through the slashery from
both sides that Patrick Porter started, so it was most refreshing to read
sensible material about the authorship question.

Only one question, is Nashe's comment about &quot;whole hamlets&quot; and Henslowe's
listing of the play in 1594 the only references to a possible &quot;ur-hamlet?&quot; A
problem of mine with making it the work of a Shakespeare in his thirties in the
late eighties is that it surely would have been a huge success--but there is no
evidence it was.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also don't think very many of the best

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you disagree?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I don't have the figures in front of me;

&gt;&gt; I doubt very much that anyone has gone through the list of
&gt;&gt; scholars in any systematic way, so if you had had the figures
&gt;&gt; in front of you, I'd have been surprised. (I was merely
&gt;&gt; asking for your impression.

&gt;&gt;&gt; however, for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fuller discussion of who agreed or disagreed, you might like to go to

&gt;&gt;http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/corambis.html#an...

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is part one of Mark Alexander's argument. Parts two and three are
&gt;&gt;&gt; also available, linked from the first page. And part four contains
&gt;&gt;&gt; counter arguments.

&gt;&gt; Mark's work quotes some prominent scholars but that's
&gt;&gt; not the same thing as a systematic attempt to determine
&gt;&gt; which scholars do and which do not accept the premise
&gt;&gt; that Polonius was certainly a caricature of Burghley.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We know what happened when important Elizabethans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that they were disrespected in a play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actors and/or playwrights were tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility: that Hamlet may have been written by someone who was beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing Polonius's lines, Burghley was dead, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that it matters much.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it matters quite a lot.

&gt;&gt; As Robert Cecil was roughly as powerful as William
&gt;&gt; Cecil, it seems to me that either Cecil had about the
&gt;&gt; same ability to suppress the play.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you won't mind my presenting
&gt;&gt;&gt; another person's argument here, that of someone from the Fellowship
&gt;&gt;&gt; site:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It matters a great deal, of course. Hamlet's dating is a big key.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley died in '98, but when Thomas Nashe spoke of 'whole Hamlets'
&gt;&gt;&gt; in his preface to Greene's Menaphon, it was '89 and Burghley was very
&gt;&gt;&gt; much alive. The [orthodox] argument is that this wasn't Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamlet.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure it is accurate to say that that is the orthodox
&gt;&gt; argument. It would be accurate, I think, to say that the
&gt;&gt; orthodox generally argue that the Hamlet we have was largely
&gt;&gt; written by Shakespeare circa 1599. I doubt that many would argue
&gt;&gt; that we know enough about the ur-Hamlet to say we know what
&gt;&gt; was in it, let alone who wrote it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They have no answer, however, for the question, who was this
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'English Seneca' of whom Nashe spoke, who, &quot;if you entreat him fair of
&gt;&gt;&gt; a frosty morning, [he] will afford you whole Hamlets, or should I say
&gt;&gt;&gt; handfulls of tragical speeches?&quot;

&gt;&gt; I've always taken the &quot;English Seneca&quot; in that to
&gt;&gt; refer to &quot;Englished Seneca&quot;. By the time Nashe was
&gt;&gt; writing, most if not all of the Senecan plays had been
&gt;&gt; translated into English. Presumably, the ur-Hamlet was in
&gt;&gt; that genre and I imagine(based only upon Nashe) that
&gt;&gt; whoever wrote it borrowed liberally from the Seneca's
&gt;&gt; translated works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Was the play so much a part of
&gt;&gt;&gt; theatrical culture that it could be referenced that easily? Easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe about the play Hamlet that we know.

&gt;&gt; #1. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar wasn't the only Elizabethan
&gt;&gt; Caesar play. Shakespeare's Richard II wasn't the only
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan play by that name. Consider Leir or
&gt;&gt; A Shrew; the quality of writing in the two plays is
&gt;&gt; generally regarded as far too poor for Shakespeare to
&gt;&gt; be held responsible. Shakespeare appears to have
&gt;&gt; rewritten the two plays. Henslowe shows us other
&gt;&gt; dramatists doing pretty much the same thing. All
&gt;&gt; that being so, surely the names alone don't tell us
&gt;&gt; as much as we would like.

&gt;&gt; #2. I think one can reasonably presume from Nashe's mention
&gt;&gt; that the play was at least fairly well-known and probably
&gt;&gt; popular. However, there were a number of Elizabethan
&gt;&gt; playwrights capable of writing a popular play on the subject.
&gt;&gt; In particular, we know that Kyd wrote at least one popular
&gt;&gt; play in the time period under consideration. And when we
&gt;&gt; look at the sentences surrounding the quoted bit from Nashe,
&gt;&gt; we see what appear to be fairly hard hits at Kyd. We also
&gt;&gt; know that Kyd was working the Seneca genre. Therefore,
&gt;&gt; when we consider who may have written the early Hamlet,
&gt;&gt; both Shakespeare and Kyd's name must spring to mind.

&gt;&gt; #3. In 1589, Nashe appears to have considered Hamlet to be
&gt;&gt; something that any ill-educated mechanic(if he had access
&gt;&gt; to an English Seneca) could come up with. Rather than
&gt;&gt; an intellectual play, it seems to point to a popular play
&gt;&gt; probably written by someone whose scholarship Nashe didn't
&gt;&gt; respect. Either Kyd or Shakespeare might qualify as
&gt;&gt; undereducated by Nashe's standards, but I think that
&gt;&gt; Nashe wouldn't consider the play that we have *now* to
&gt;&gt; be something just *any* ill-educated dramatist could
&gt;&gt; borrow out of Seneca.

&gt;&gt; #4 How likely is it that Meres would have knowingly left
&gt;&gt; one of Shakespeare's best plays off his list? Doesn't
&gt;&gt; seem too likely to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course this is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; non-starter for the [orthodox], WS couldn't have written this Hamlet.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I doubt most reputable scholars say that Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; was definitely not responsible for some or all of
&gt;&gt; the ur-Hamlet. Why would they? (It isn't as
&gt;&gt; if we know much about Shakespeare's early career
&gt;&gt; or much about what was in the early Hamlet.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;His son appears
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have had about the same level of influence, so the rest of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument would seem to cover pretty much the same ground.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you think that de Vere, who wrote a good number of letters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the Cecils askingfor help at court, deliberately blackened
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's reputation on stage. That does seem rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insulting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First, I would say that family relationships are often fraught with
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambivalence. Would you argue with that? I have many examples. Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt; had been both the ward and son in law of Burghley and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship, as we all know, was not an easy one.

&gt;&gt; I don't doubt that a playwright might deliberately hurt
&gt;&gt; someone they had a family relationship with. However,
&gt;&gt; the evidence is clear that Burghley frequently worked
&gt;&gt; to further Oxford's interests. It's also clear that Oxford
&gt;&gt; frequently asked him for favors. In such instances,
&gt;&gt; I don't think that it is common for people to intentionally
&gt;&gt; and publically hurt their benefactors. (In the heat of
&gt;&gt; the moment, sure, but we're talking about writing a play
&gt;&gt; which is a relatively deliberate activity.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, it is possible that Oxford used a pseudonym so that those &quot;in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the know&quot; or inner circles would know, but those who weren't, would
&gt;&gt;&gt; not.

&gt;&gt; Let's suppose that(as you think) that knowledge that Oxford
&gt;&gt; was the author was a prerequisite for knowing that Burghley was
&gt;&gt; insultingly caricatured.

&gt;&gt; Now let's further suppose that Oxford wasn't the author. By your
&gt;&gt; reasoning, *no one* would have known that Burghley was meant to
&gt;&gt; take a hit or two.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Third, Polonius, as one actor said to me, is &quot;a dream of a part.&quot; It
&gt;&gt;&gt; has its scathing moments when he is shown to be conniving, wordy, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; (possibly) doddering, but he is also revealed as a senior statesman of
&gt;&gt;&gt; some importance.

&gt;&gt; Let suppose that the Cecils thought that it might be *possible*
&gt;&gt; that some of Polonius was based upon Burghley. Let's further
&gt;&gt; suppose that they understood the Polonius character to be
&gt;&gt; a *mostly* fair portrait. Would they have taken much offence?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose a hothead might burn a bridge. But then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also suppose most hotheads know that after they've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; burned the bridge, they need to either repair it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or forget about asking forhelp. If

Peter Groves, an accomplished writer in his own right with no

&quot;The poor old sod writes about as competently as he reads. Or
perhaps like Weir he can't recognize his own words: 'the remarkable
absense [sic] of any reference in any of the Works to either names
Jesus or Christ is notable. In fact the only reference at all is
the diffident [sic] mention of Jesus as [sic] epitaph'&quot;

&lt;&gt;

&quot;Innes's scrambled English makes Weir, Baker and even Parisious look
articulate.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

&quot;Come to think of it, a dictionary could help you with all sorts of

'aspersion', and so on.&quot;

There are many more of a similar nature from other literate and

robust consensus, I think that you should consider the possibility that
you frequently do not make yourself sufficiently clear. However, if in

David, I am distracted by all but chess business at the moment. Interesting
you should mention Pravda:- (Phil Innes)

Leader of Kalmyk republic blackmails the Kremlin
06/11/2004 18:49

President of Kalmyk autonomous republic Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov is telling
the Kremlin that if Moscow dismisses him, there will be the second Chechnya
in Kalmykia.
Meanwhile, in republic&quot;s capital Elista political hunger-strike with
the demand to dismiss President Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov, is in progress. The
hunger-strike started on May 21, simultaneously with Women&quot;s World Chess
Championship beginning, and continues after the championship was finished.

The action was initiated by Basan Gorodovikov and Boris Andzhaev -
well-known politicians in the republic who made the statement that they were
protesting &quot;against anti-people rule of Ilyumdzhinov - oppressor of civil
rights and freedoms in Kalmykia&quot;.

13 more people (including 5 women) have joined the hunger-strike. On
June 6 the opposition consisting of regional branches of several political
parties, organized picketing in support of the protesters. More than 500
people from different regions of Kalmykia participated.

The participants of the picketing denounced Kalmykia&quot;s being donor for
FIDE (International Chess Federation whose President is Mr. Ilyumdzhinov),
&quot;We don&quot;t want holidays in poverty-stricken region. When you, participants
of the chess championship, are enjoying yourselves with the concerts of the
poverty-stricken performers and dinners in expensive restaurants, the
majority of children in Kalmykia have no enough food. Poor Kalmykia cannot
be donor and money-bag for FIDE!&quot;

&quot;The authoritarian regime of carpet-bagger Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov has
existed in the republic for 11 years. According to Russian human rights
activists, Kalmykia holds the record of abusing human rights. Prosecution of
political opponents, physical assaults on opponents and the murders of those
who &quot;know too much&quot; became ordinary things in Kalmykia. Republic&quot;s
law-enforcers are involved in prosecuting Ilyumdzhinov's opponents. This
should be stopped, otherwise such methods will be spread around Russia like
cancer tumor&quot;, said spokesman of Kalmyk Human Rights Center Sergey Ageev at
the press-conference on April 14.

There were some more demonstrations in Kalmykia against the regime of
Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov in December of 2003. The protesters were indignant with
Kalmyk authorities&quot; breaking the law and the rights of voters during the
elections in Russian and Kalmyk parliaments. The people who came on December
8, 2003 on the central square of Elista, requested canceling the results of
the elections and President Ilyumdzhinov&quot;s resignation. There were non-stop
pickets of the building of Kalmyk government for 72 hours. To give Kirsan
Ilyumdzhinov political support, Russian President&quot;s Envoy in Southern
Federal District Sergey Kazantsev and Deputy of Russian Public Prosecutor
Sergey Fridinsky. Simultaneously, up to 2,500 troops of Interior Ministry
were sent to Kalmykia from the neighboring regions, upon Mr. Ilyumdzhinov&quot;s
request, to disperse the protesters. All this stopped the picketing.

According to Semen Ateev, Ilyumdzhinov&quot;s regime is using all its
resources and connections to keep silence in Russia about the situation in
Kalmykia. This is proved by the fact that Russian national media from time
to time publish stories praising Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov.

Chairman of the Executive Committee for Special Congress of Kalmyk
People Vladimir Babaev says that &quot;the republic&quot;s authority serve only the
interests of the people and groups being close to Ilyumdzhinov. Meanwhile,
there is no strategy for development of Kalmykia, and Kalmyk President is
involved in many scandals, adventurous projects and provocations. The
economy of the republic is not developing on the market basis, Kalmykia is
the last in Russia in all basic economic indicators. Living standards are
extremely low, industries collapsed, agriculture is in recession. Kalmykia
is unable to provide its population with food. High unemployment forces
people to leave the republic. Officials are corrupted, capitals are drained
out of the republic. Kalmyk authorities press their opponents during
election campaigns and falsify election results. The people knowing about
the financial affairs of the regime, are murdered. We have the list of the
victims of the regime of Ilyumdzhinov, there are well-known people in the
republic, on the list&quot;.

Valery Badmaev explained the reasons of the federal authorities&quot;
ignoring the signs of authoritarianism in Kalmykia. According to Badmaev,
President Ilyumdzhinov is blackmailing the Kremlin. &quot;Having started the war
in Chechnya, Moscow is afraid of repeating similar scenario in Kalmykia.
Meanwhile, Kirsan Ilyumdzhinov is trying to persuade the Kremlin that if
Moscow dismisses him, there will be the second Chechnya in Kalmykia.
However, the situation in Kalmykia is absolutely different, and Mr.
Ilyumdzhinov is just lying to Russian authorities&quot;, said the reporter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; strength of feeling that Oxfordians presume the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Herberts had towards Edward de Vere appears to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely speculative: William Howard failed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; marry Bridget. Phillip Howard married Elizabeth

&gt;&gt;&gt; is known to have demonstrated much fondness for
&gt;&gt;&gt; their father, who, according to the record, pissed
&gt;&gt;&gt; away what should have been their inheritance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is either Howard known to have said anything positive
&gt;&gt;&gt; about Edward de Vere before or after he was dead?
&gt; Only one question, is Nashe's comment about &quot;whole hamlets&quot; and Henslowe's

Dekker's _Satiromastix_, 1601:
&quot;my name's &quot;Hamlet revenge&quot;; thou hast been at Paris Garden, hast not?&quot;

Langley's Swan theater was in Paris Garden, so I take Dekker's line
to be an indication that the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed there.
In connection with that, it's perhaps worth remembering William
Wayte's 1596 petition for suerities of peace in which Wayte claimed
that he feared that Shakespeare, Langley, Dorothy Suer, and
Ann Lee might kill him.

There is also the well known reference in Thomas Lodge's _Wits Misery_
(1596):

&quot;...he walks for the most part in black under colour of
gravity, and looks as pale as the Visard of the ghost which
cried so miserably at the Theator like an oister wife, Hamlet

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scholarly caution is always good. Willingness to have an open mind and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discuss new ideas is also good.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shouldn't scholarly caution include having an open mind?
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Believing that one already knows it all seems a very
&gt;&gt;&gt; uncautious state of mind.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also don't think very many of the best
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars have believed it more than a possibility.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you disagree?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I don't have the figures in front of me;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt very much that anyone has gone through the list of
&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars in any systematic way, so if you had had the figures
&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of you, I'd have been surprised. (I was merely
&gt;&gt;&gt; asking for your impression.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fuller discussion of who agreed or disagreed, you might like to go to

&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/corambis.html#an...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is part one of Mark Alexander's argument. Parts two and three are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also available, linked from the first page. And part four contains
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; counter arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark's work quotes some prominent scholars but that's
&gt;&gt;&gt; not the same thing as a systematic attempt to determine
&gt;&gt;&gt; which scholars do and which do not accept the premise
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Polonius was certainly a caricature of Burghley.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We know what happened when important Elizabethans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that they were disrespected in a play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actors and/or playwrights were tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right. It's very strange. But I believe you have omitted
&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility: that Hamlet may have been written by someone who was beyond
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley's influence and could not be tossed in jail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that at the time Shakespeare was most likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing Polonius's lines, Burghley was dead, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that it matters much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it matters quite a lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As Robert Cecil was roughly as powerful as William
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cecil, it seems to me that either Cecil had about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same ability to suppress the play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you won't mind my presenting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another person's argument here, that of someone from the Fellowship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; site:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It matters a great deal, of course. Hamlet's dating is a big key.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burghley died in '98, but when Thomas Nashe spoke of 'whole Hamlets'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in his preface to Greene's Menaphon, it was '89 and Burghley was very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much alive. The [orthodox] argument is that this wasn't Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamlet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure it is accurate to say that that is the orthodox
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument. It would be accurate, I think, to say that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; orthodox generally argue that the Hamlet we have was largely
&gt;&gt;&gt; written by Shakespeare circa 1599. I doubt that many would argue
&gt;&gt;&gt; that we know enough about the ur-Hamlet to say we know what
&gt;&gt;&gt; was in it, let alone who wrote it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They have no answer, however, for the question, who was this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'English Seneca' of whom Nashe spoke, who, &quot;if you entreat him fair of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a frosty morning, [he] will afford you whole Hamlets, or should I say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; handfulls of tragical speeches?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've always taken the &quot;English Seneca&quot; in that to
&gt;&gt;&gt; refer to &quot;Englished Seneca&quot;. By the time Nashe was
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing, most if not all of the Senecan plays had been
&gt;&gt;&gt; translated into English. Presumably, the ur-Hamlet was in
&gt;&gt;&gt; that genre and I imagine(based only upon Nashe) that
&gt;&gt;&gt; whoever wrote it borrowed liberally from the Seneca's
&gt;&gt;&gt; translated works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Was the play so much a part of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theatrical culture that it could be referenced that easily? Easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe about the play Hamlet that we know.

&gt;&gt;&gt; #1. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar wasn't the only Elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt; Caesar play. Shakespeare's Richard II wasn't the only
&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabethan play by that name. Consider Leir or
&gt;&gt;&gt; A Shrew; the quality of writing in the two plays is
&gt;&gt;&gt; generally regarded as far too poor for Shakespeare to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be held responsible. Shakespeare appears to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; rewritten the two plays. Henslowe shows us other
&gt;&gt;&gt; dramatists doing pretty much the same thing. All
&gt;&gt;&gt; that being so, surely the names alone don't tell us
&gt;&gt;&gt; as much as we would like.

&gt;&gt;&gt; #2. I think one can reasonably presume from Nashe's mention
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the play was at least fairly well-known and probably
&gt;&gt;&gt; popular. However, there were a number of Elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt; playwrights capable of writing a popular play on the subject.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, we know that Kyd wrote at least one popular
&gt;&gt;&gt; play in the time period under consideration. And when we
&gt;&gt;&gt; look at the sentences surrounding the quoted bit from Nashe,
&gt;&gt;&gt; we see what appear to be fairly hard hits at Kyd. We also
&gt;&gt;&gt; know that Kyd was working the Seneca genre. Therefore,
&gt;&gt;&gt; when we consider who may have written the early Hamlet,
&gt;&gt;&gt; both Shakespeare and Kyd's name must spring to mind.

&gt;&gt;&gt; #3. In 1589, Nashe appears to have considered Hamlet to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; something that any ill-educated mechanic(if he had access
&gt;&gt;&gt; to an English Seneca) could come up with. Rather than
&gt;&gt;&gt; an intellectual play, it seems to point to a popular play
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably written by someone whose scholarship Nashe didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; respect. Either Kyd or Shakespeare might qualify as
&gt;&gt;&gt; undereducated by Nashe's standards, but I think that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nashe wouldn't consider the play that we have *now* to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be something just *any* ill-educated dramatist could
&gt;&gt;&gt; borrow out of Seneca.

&gt;&gt;&gt; #4 How likely is it that Meres would have knowingly left
&gt;&gt;&gt; one of Shakespeare's best plays off his list? Doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem too likely to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course this is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; non-starter for the [orthodox], WS couldn't have written this Hamlet.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt most reputable scholars say that Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; was definitely not responsible for some or all of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the ur-Hamlet. Why would they? (It isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt; if we know much about Shakespeare's early career
&gt;&gt;&gt; or much about what was in the early Hamlet.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;His son appears
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have had about the same level of influence, so the rest of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument would seem to cover pretty

Interesting that this thread sould mention both UFOs and Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov. The 'Sunday Times' reported yesterday that Ilyumzhinov
claimed in 2001 to have been taken on a UFO trip by extraterrestrials.
And I'm not making this up either!

I'm reading Ilyumzhinov's autobiography at the moment, it's well worth
reading...

Here is the 'Sunday Times' article:

&lt;&gt;

Russian ‘king’ blows millions on Chess City
Mark Franchetti, Elista, Kalmykia

EVEN by the flamboyant standards of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the eccentric,
Rolls-Royce-driving president of the impoverished Russian republic of
Kalmykia, the scheme is extravagant.

In a large expanse of parched steppe on the outskirts of Elista, the
sleepy capital, Ilyumzhinov, 42, is preparing to spend hundreds of
millions of pounds on a colossal monument to his life-long passion:
chess.

A five-storey, dome-shaped palace dedicated to the game is already in
place. Visitors attending tournaments there will soon be able to stay in
a hotel shaped like four giant chess pieces. There will also be an
amphitheatre where games of “human chess” will be played, with people
moving across an enormous board.

For those who might relish a short break from chess, Ilyumzhinov is
laying on an opera house, ski lifts to artificial slopes, a man-made
lake with a beach, an airfield and a safari centre where tourists will
be able to shoot wolves from helicopters.

Chess City — as it will be known — is intended to put Europe’s only
Buddhist republic on the map and will feature not only temples but a
sprawling residence for the Dalai Lama in case he should visit.

The leader, who is fond of white capes and designer suits, was elected
president of the World Chess Federation in 1995 and once toured 80
countries in a year.

“The inhabitants of Kalmykia won’t have to travel to Japan or other far-
away places to look into the future because everything will be here in
Chess City,” said Ilyumzhinov, who won the republic’s own chess
championship at the age of nine. “The city will set the standard for the
rest of the world.”

Ilyumzhinov’s plans are bitterly opposed by many in Kalmykia, one of
Russia’s poorest republics, where the average monthly salary is £55 and
water is brought in by lorry from neighbouring regions.

“Chess and money — that’s all he’s interested in, while we’re struggling
to feed our children,” said Nyudla Kichikova, a mother of four who has
joined a hunger strike by 30 local people demanding the president’s
resignation.

An unemployed accountant who earns £25 a month by picking potatoes, she
has taken only water for 16 days and lies in bed under a banner stating:
“Kirsan, handcuffs await you.”

“Chess City is a farce,” she cried. “He has no shame.”

Ilyumzhinov was 31 when he became president of Kalmykia, a semi-
autonomous republic of 300,000 souls in southern Russia, near the
Caspian Sea. Its indigenous people are descendants of a Mongol tribe,
driven west in the 17th century, whose bloodline is traced back to
Genghis Khan.

Billboards of the president on horseback dominate the capital, a drab
mixture of single-storey houses and Soviet-era apartment blocks
distinguished from other provincial Russian towns by small Buddhist
shrines dotted around its streets.

Ilyumzhinov made his fortune in the car business and was one of the
first people in the former Soviet Union to own a Rolls. He won election
in 1993 after promising to turn Kalmykia into a “second Kuwait” where
“every shepherd would have a cellphone”. He has yet to fulfil that
promise.

Nor, according to locals, has he delivered on a pledge to pay $100 to
each person who voted for him. He once said he would buy Diego Maradona,
the Argentine footballer, for a local club but that did not happen
either.

Most news bulletins nevertheless begin with glowing reports of his
latest achievements and his curious beliefs.

“I have been on a UFO,” he said in 2001. “The vessel was the size of a
football field. The extraterrestrials put a yellow space suit on me.
They gave me a tour of the spaceship and showed me the command centre.
We flew to some planet. I felt very comfortable with them, very
natural.”

Yet it is chess that preoccupies Ilyumzhinov. The game is an important
part of the school curriculum.

Since Ilyumzhinov built his £20m palace to stage the 1998 World Chess
Federation championship, there has been muttering among his people about
how they have remained pawns while he plays king.

“He has done nothing for the republic,” complained Valeri Badmayev, 53,
a journalist on the hunger strike. “Unemployment is at 34%, there is no
press freedom and he has crushed dissent. He runs the place like a
medieval baron.”

Supporters of Ilyumzhinov reject such criticism. Buryancha Galzanov, the
president’s spokesman, puts unemployment at 3.5% and says the republic’s
agriculture is flourishing. Chess City will in any case be built with
foreign investment, officials say.

“All this criticism is ridiculous,” said Netgen Platonov, the deputy
head of Chess City. “People say they are poor but if you think only
about your own belly we shouldn’t travel to space either.”

Opposition can in any case be dangerous. Larisa Yudina, the editor of an
underground newspaper, accused the government of corruption. She was
stabbed to death and dumped in a pond in 1998. After pressure from
Moscow, one of the president’s aides and several other men were charged
with the killing.

Dear Banana,

and recipients of 6 newsgroups - it truly is a rare occasion when such
diverse interests can come together. However, I had to connect with the
Times link below to ensure this message was not a spoof.

I will not post to all 6 groups again, in fact will only write to
rec.games.chess.politics since the subject of this conversation is actually
supported by our votes and our money.

But thank you for the reference to the Times article, I was not previously
aware that flying Buddhists would be shooting bears from helicopters around
Chess City, although I was aware of the murder and the current hunger
strike.

Cordially, Phil Innes
