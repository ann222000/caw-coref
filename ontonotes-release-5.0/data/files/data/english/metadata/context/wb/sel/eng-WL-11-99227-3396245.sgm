Hey, when did we start putting women into combat roles?

The military's definition of restricted positions is pretty strange. Women are barred from all "Combat" MOSs in the Army, but many combat MOSs aren't Combat MOSs.

MP is not closed to women, but M1
Abrams Tank Maintainer is closed to women. Aviation Officer is open but Cannon Crewmember is closed.

I don't see the sense of the current system. We pretend that women are to be kept out of combat, but it's just a handwave. The effect is largely to keep women from getting Combat Infantry Badges, but not much else.

As far as I'm concerned, the standard should be whether the servicemember can do the job. At the very least, we shouldn't be merely pretending to segregate women from combat.

The Israelis, who have a lot of women in their army, don't put them in combat, not because they can't do it, but because the misogenistic Arabs would not surrender to a woman and casualties on both sides went up.

I'm with you and foresee in the far future a military force like on Aliens , manly men and manly women if you catch my continental drift.
