Intellectuals, along with others, are the life and essence of any
civilization. They &quot;give advice to humanity on how to conduct its
affairs.&quot; Â A society, and indeed, any society without a bourgeoning
class of intellectuals cannot truly flourish. Such a society may
stagnate, disintegrate or die. According to Paul Johnson, &quot;the rise of
the secular intellectual has been a key factor in shaping the modern
world...men arose to assert that they could diagnose the ills of society
and cure them with their own unaided intellects: more, that they could
devise formulae whereby not merely the structure of society but the
fundamental habits of human beings could be transformed for the
better.&quot;

The western world is never short of intellectuals and gadflies; and
neither was Nigeria in the early years of its civilization. The west
boast of Lillian Hellman, Henrik Ibsen, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Bertolt
Brecht, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, Jean-Paul Sartre, Noam Chomsky,
Victor Gollancz, Ernest Hemingway, and Edmund Wilson amongst others;
Nigeria had the likes of Kelsey Harrison, Kalu Ezera, Chinua Achebe,
Wole Soyinka, Chike Obi, Alele Williams, Tam-David-West, Dipo Fashina,
Eskor Toyo, Claude Ake, Kole Omotosho, G.G. Darah, Ade Ajayi, S. G.
Ikoku, Tai Solarin, Orlando George, Christopher Okigbo, Olajide Aluko,
J.P Clark, Omotunde Olorode, and many other eminent and intellectually
gifted citizens.

Considering the state of affairs in today's Nigeria, it is easy to
forget that there was a time in the history of Nigeria when there were
dozens and dozens and dozens of intellectuals, radicals and gadflies
in the Nigerian media and institutions of higher learning. Not only
where they gifted, they were rigorous and honest and resolute in their
thinking and in their pursuits. They were the conscience of the
nation, the gate-keepers of our cathedral of knowledge. They helped
shape the nature and direction of the country and institutions. Their
writings and pronouncements affected the thinking of decision and
policy makers. As brutal and wayward as the military establishment
was, these titans, to a great extent, helped to keep it in order.

In yesteryears, Nigerians were known the world over -- not for their
alleged duplicity, but for their brilliance and humanity. Nigerians
were known in high places for their enviable achievements. From NASA
to Buckingham Palace, from Makerere to MIT, from Oxford to Cambridge
and from Harvard to Howard University and to a great many institutes
and institutions around the globe, Nigeria was the toast of the town.
Aside from the thinkers within the ivory towers, there were those
whose voices emanated loud and clear from the pages of the Nigerian
newspapers and magazines. In this regard, there were great minds like
Peter Enahoro, Babatunde Ajose, Lateef Jakande, Bisi Onabanjo, Dele
Giwa, Nosa Igiebor, MCK Ajuluchukwu, Dan Agbese, Sonala Olumhense,
Christina Anyanwu, Odia Ofeimun, and several others. That was
yesteryears, the Nigeria of old.

Today, Nigeria is different. It is almost unfathomable how Nigeria
went from great heights to low ebbs. Dr. Olayiwola Abegunrin, formerly
of OAU and now a professor at Howard University, posited that the
Nigerian military bear some of the responsibility for &quot;destroying our
institutions...by some of the policies they promulgated and pursued,
beginning in the General Yakubu Gowon era.&quot; Some of the policies they
pursued, along with all the coups and countercoups, helped weakened,
and in some cases, destroyed our sense of nation-building and sense of
self. A great many of our national treasure were prosecuted,
persecuted, harassed, jailed, or sent into exile; and in some cases,
the military simply made life and living miserable and unbearable.

In the end, some of our best and brightest left in search of stability
and greener pastures. Who replaced most of our national treasures? The
scum of the earth. The third-rate. The mediocre. The traders. The
419ers. The Yahoo-yahoo boys. Political prostitutes and pretenders.
The Godfathers. The Ghana-must-Go specialists. Suddenly -- suddenly --
the distasteful and impermissible became permissible and sacred. It
became ok to steal. It became acceptable to be a professional
sycophant. It became fashionable to be an illiterate in a literate
world. It became fashionable to look down on great minds and great
accomplishments. And so it is that street urchins have now become the
bosses, the oga patapatas.

It is sad; sad and disgraceful that the vast majority of Nigerians
living today does not know the person or the works of people like
Ayodele Awojobi, Bala Usman, Ishola Oshobu, Cornelius Ubani, Dr. Segun
Oshoba, Ola Oni, Gbolabo Ogunsanwo, Bode Onimode, Biodun Jaiyefo,
Segun Okeowo, Bala Mohammed, Sam Amuka, Fela Anikulapo Kuti and
others. But for such men and women, Nigeria may have long gone to the
dogs. All those mentioned in this treatise -- and of course others too
numerous to mention -- gave up comfort and convenience for country and
for humanity.

According to Mr. Sonala Olumhense, himself a member of the great-
generation, &quot;the flip side of the coin -- the &quot;absence of
intellectualism&quot; -- is the &quot;presence of materialism&quot; and the pursuit
of the inconsequential. Insignificance, decadence and barbarism! That
is where we are today: the willful pursuit of the insignificant,
materialism and stupidities. We honor men and women lacking foresight
and brilliance of mind and good character. We look up to, prostrate
and genuflect before men and women with inferior sensibility. Such
pursuit diminishes the glory and prosperity of the country. Every
great nation or at least, nations of any consequence all have men and
women at the vanguard of knowledge and intellectualism. They stir
things up. They make rulers uncomfortable. They nudge us to greater
heights. Why then is the government uncomfortable with men and women?

Radicals, leftists, troublemakers, intellectuals, and the &quot;crazies&quot;
are the salt and honey of any nation. We must allow such minds
breathing space, let them be. They think for us. They show us in
bright and favorable light. And they act as our nation's conscience.
As a consequence of our contempt and apathy towards our intellectuals
and gadflies, we are gradually becoming an empty and hollow nation.
Nigeria feels stale and uninviting without them. Paradoxically,
Nigeria's loss is the world's gain; for in the ivory towers of
virtually all the countries in the world are such Nigerians --
contributing to the advancement of their host nations.

It is painful, painful and sad to walk into some enclaves in this and
other countries only to find the &quot;greatest Nigerians&quot; toiling for
nothing -- when they should have been toiling for their motherland.
But then, what are they to do if their country does not want them?
Well, any country that does not revere and or want its intellectuals
is an imprudent country.

Dear Sabella

The first time I came across your name was in connection with my work &quot;NEVER AGAIN&quot; which, hopefully, will become my tenth book. Â So, I am not surprised that you have given your readers this spirited discussion on the Nigerian intellectuals. Â You ought to be commended for speaking forthrightly on this subject. Â And thank you for the list of Nigerian intellectuals whom you cited.

The Nigerian intellectuals still exist except that they had abadoned their calling for the mundane god of crass materialism. Â You are right in noting that the pursuit of avarice and greed have replaced their role as the conscience of the nation and people. Â The intellectuals have become victims of the pressures of life since they must compete in the rat race for the acquisition of materials. Â But who says that they must do so?

My contribution here is to emphasize a point which I have made elsewhere -- which is, that the Nigerian military must ever be held for the destruction of all that is sacred, worthy, and significant in our society. Â They came, saw, and conquered. Â And, I am not alone in holding this position. Â The military in Africa were not redeemers but destroyers.

In 2002, the historian, Robert B. Edgerton, in his book, &quot;Africa's Armies From Honor to Infamy: A History From 1791 to the Present,&quot; pointed Â the gross corruption within the Nigerian military and the terrible attrocities which they committed in Liberia. Â We all know how kleptocracy rose to the heavens during the military interregnum. Â Yet all we read in the press is about the &quot;wonderful work&quot; which they have done to the country. Â The military is responsible for the loss of sanity and sobriety in our ethics and morality.

Professors Ali Mazrui and George Ayittey have written on this matter of African intellectuals not living up to their expectations. Â Ayittey, in particular, harshly criticized them for their silence and collaboration with dictatorial regimes and thus gave legitimacy to such governments. Â Thus, as human beings, the intellectuals simply have betrayed their cause.

I often wonder why intelligent people cannot learn the lessons which nature and natural disasters teach us daily -- which is, that the empires built upon straw and rubble will certainly someday crumble and crush the vain acquisitions of mankind. Â But it is the ideas and wisdom which great men and women pursue that will lead to honor, glory and grandiour.

Therefore, the Nigerian intellectuals are hereby urged to redeem themselves wherever they may be by returning to &quot;the willful pursuit of&quot; significance. Â It is my prayer that they will abandon &quot;the pursuit of the inconsequential&quot; in order to re-establish their footprints upon the sands of time. Â If the powers that be in Nigeria do not quickly realize this need, the overthrow of all that we know as Nigeria will swiftly sweep us all away.
