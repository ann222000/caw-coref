Our American cousins have been spared sight of this TV
monstrosity for a few brief weeks. How lucky they are.

It's actually quite interesting -- in a perverse sort of way.
It's the very B E S T that Strats can produce -- and it's
an abomination. It has as much to do with history as
Monty Python's &quot;Search for the Holy Grail&quot;, and as much
to do with reality as &quot;Buffy -- Vampire Slayer&quot;.

Image after image is introduced with a straight face and
a straight lie -- and there is not the slightest pretence at
qualification. It's history by a seven-year old for other
seven-year-olds, none of whom have yet got near the
idea of 'evidence'. A more truthful story could be told
about Father Christmas and his reindeer -- and it would
be told in the same fatuous tones: &quot;Hey, what story
can I think of next -- anything will do for the kind of
idiots that are likely to be watching this . . . . &quot;.

It will destroy whatever reputation Wood had acquired as
an historian.

We have no evidence that the Stratman actually attended
the local school, but that does not stop Wood describing
in the most minute detail how he spent his time there,
including: &quot; . . . One day Master Hunt showed him a book
on poetry -- it was Arthur Golding's translation of Ovid . . &quot;.

It's Bible stories for infants. Of course, Wood's complete
naivety comes out in this instance. More informed
Stratfordians would keep away from that topic. They'd
know that Arthur Golding was the maternal uncle of the
main opposition candidate, and that &quot;he did the
translation&quot; while living in the same house -- when
Oxford was in his mid-teens.

Another story: &quot; . . Shakespeare's parents took him to
Coventry to see the Mystery plays . .&quot;. Somehow Wood
forgets to mention that Coventry is nearly 20 miles from
Stratford, a good two days walk for a child.

As I mentioned in another post (not responded to by any
Strat, of course) he claims that Shakespeare used all
manner of local Warwickshire terms; the falsity of each
claim can be readily exposed by glancing at the OED.
He says that a 'kecksie' is a child's whistle, and he picks
a blade of grass and blows it to show how. But he forgot
to read Henry V where the word is used:
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
Losing both beauty and utility.

Children's whistles fit in that context as well as pig's
ears. This is about as good an illustration of the quality
of Wood's &quot;research&quot; as any.

You can only produce an account of the life of the
Stratman as Shakespeare if you are determined to
ignore -- or grossly misinterpret -- every word of the
canon. Wood is well set down that road.

Paul.

I suppose the son of a leading citizen might have got a lift on a horse or
even in a bumpy carriage. There really is no need to assume that the Sh
family had no transport. Possibly the family went, and stayed overnight or
for a few days: the Mystery plays would take more than one day if performed
in a full version.

I must assume that you have not read pages 17 and 18 of Wood's book, where
he precisely does not say that a kecksie &quot;is&quot; a whistle. 'Kecksie' is a
blade of the rough couch-grass with which children still make piercing
whistle sounds. (In H5 it is to be understood in its basic sense, as a
'hateful' weed for which the farmer has to keep an eye open and a spade
ready.) Wood gives further examples of surviving Warwickshire dialect words
and expressions also found in Shakespeare.

On behalf of Christopher Marlowe,
I'd like to say that his probable father,
William Parr, is in fact
buried in Warwick,
at the Collegiate Church of St. Mary,
where he may have been visiting
the Earl of Warwick, who was a friend of his...
if I can find any more definite information
on the Warwick connection I'll add it later.

(Christopher was a child at the time, and may have
accompanied his father on Warwickshire visits...
or, of course, might have learned some dialect from
William Shakespeare.)

The plant Wood plucked and used as a whistle was not Heracleum, which in my
Shropshire youth was 'cow parsley', properly 'hogweed': it has large leaves
and thick but hollow stems that children use as pea-shooters. We confused
it, I think, with a different but not dissimilar-looking plant that blooms a
little earlier, the true cow parsley, which has feathery leaves. Both are
common wayside plants, and look splendid along a country road when in full
bloom. (Hogweed is not to be confused with the much larger and poisonous
giant hogweed, which causes agonising burns on the mouth to any child who
tries it as a pea-shooter.)

I don't know for certain what the &quot;Henry V&quot; passage means by 'kecks', or
whether Wood was correct is saying that 'kecksie' is the Warwickshire name
for couch-grass, but that's what he plucked in the TV programme, and it is a
nasty weed. The blades are sharp-edged, as children who have cut themselves
while whistling have painfully found out.

Nope. I rely on Strats to make their own case. They

it is IMO highly unlikely that couch-grass is intended

&gt;&gt; Have you actually examined, rather than glancing at, a wide range of unusual
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare words in both OED and Joseph Wright's huge dialect dictionary?
&gt;&gt; It is admittedly unfortunate that there is, as far as I know, no specialist
&gt;&gt;&quot;dialect dictionary on historical primciples&quot;, but these two sources supply
&gt;&gt; persuasive if slender evidence that the author of the plays and poems was a
&gt;&gt; Warwickshire man.

&gt; On behalf of Christopher Marlowe,
&gt; I'd like to say that his probable father,
&gt; William Parr, is in fact
&gt; buried in Warwick,
&gt; at the Collegiate Church of St. Mary,
&gt; where he may have been visiting
&gt; the Earl of Warwick, who was a friend of his...
&gt; if I can find any more definite information
&gt; on the Warwick connection I'll add it later.

"/>

William Parr may have been visiting his cousins,
the Throckmortons,
in Warwickshire,
who were married into the Arden family.
(the Ardens of course take their name from the Forest of Arden,
in Warwickshire.)
It has not been proved they are the same family
as the Shakespeare Ardens.

The Pembroke/Herbert brothers, (in the First Folio),
are also Throckmorton cousins.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Christopher was a child at the time, and may have
&gt; accompanied his father on Warwickshire visits...
&gt; or, of course, might have learned some dialect from
&gt; William Shakespeare.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; He says that a 'kecksie' is a child's whistle, and he picks
&gt;&gt;&gt; a blade of grass and blows it to show how. But he forgot
&gt;&gt;&gt; to read Henry V where the word is used:
&gt;&gt;&gt; But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Losing both beauty and utility.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Children's whistles fit in that context as well as pig's
&gt;&gt;&gt; ears. This is about as good an illustration of the quality
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Wood's &quot;research&quot; as any.

&gt;&gt; I must assume that you have not read pages 17 and 18 of Wood's book, where
&gt;&gt; he precisely does not say that a kecksie &quot;is&quot; a whistle. 'Kecksie' is a
&gt;&gt; blade of the rough couch-grass with which children still make piercing
&gt;&gt; whistle sounds. (In H5 it is to be understood in its basic sense, as a
&gt;&gt; 'hateful' weed for which the farmer has to keep an eye open and a spade
&gt;&gt; ready.) Wood gives further examples of surviving Warwickshire dialect words
&gt;&gt; and expressions also found in Shakespeare.

Um, travel between Coventry and Stratford was extremely
common in the 16th century, given that they were both
market towns between which merchandise and people
constantly passed back and forth. Also, both towns

Crowley is wrong, of course. The playwright John Webster's
father was a coachmaker; he lived in London in the 16th century,
and became quite wealthy. There was a thriving coachmaking
trade in London then, though it wasn't until 1677 that the
Coachmakers were organized as a separate livery company.
For some background on the London coachmaking trade in the
16th and 17th centuries, see Mary Edmond, 'In Search of John Webster',
Times Literary Supplement, 24 December 1976, p. 1621.

in London around 1600. Maybe some were made

fashionable until after that date. The topic is not
obscure. Coaches were the property of the richest
classes, who wrote the letters and left detailed
records about such matters. When the Queen
changed palaces she often rode on horseback,
almost to her dying day.

American experience in the 19th century is not
a reliable guide for England in the 16th, Tom.
I appreciate that you may not know that. The virgin
prairies were usually flat and rock-hard. A well-built
wagon with good horses could travel well over them.
Whereas the ground in England was often soaked
and boggy, and became hopelessly chewed up. No
one ever built a good road from Stratford to Coventry
before about 1830. The Romans didn't and there
was no one else who was willing to put in the time
and money. That's why they dug a canal to Stratford
sometime around 1800.

Not between Stratford and Coventry, they didn't --
nor between the great bulk of small towns and
cities throughout England. Trade does not
happen unless it can be regular. If you can't
rely on the roads being available, you just don't
produce the stuff. And you could not rely on the
bulk of the roads in England before about 1850.
That's one reason why the railways were so
revolutionary, and why every small town sought
(and usually got) its local railway service.
There were frequent local famines in the 1590s,
with the price of corn varying greatly from one
locality to the next. Very poor transport was a
major factor.

Not a hope. The armies in the Civil War (which did
a lot of fighting in the area, e.g. Edgehill in 1642)
had major problems moving guns, etc. Their
progress was desperately slow.

The Queen herself travelled by litter when she visited
the area on a royal progress in 1572. This passage
describes a progress in Kent in 1573:

&quot;Elizabeth herself travelled mainly on horseback, occasionally
by litter, but two empty coaches, built by her Dutch carriage-
master, William Boonen, followed in attendance if she and her
ladies wanted a change. . .&quot;

They usually got into their local town, for essential
business, and a bit of socialising -- but that was it.
Why would anyone (who didn't have to) want to
endure the nightmare of a journey to a town 20
miles away? Most people never travelled -- in their
lives -- more than 10 or 15 miles from home. There
was usually no point in asking local people for
directions, such as: &quot;Which way to Coventry?&quot;
because they would not know. They had no need
for such knowledge. Coventry was as remote and
as abstract as Portsmouth or Moscow.

All this is well documented. It was a different world
-- and not a bit like your patch of East Texas (or
wherever). The 'ignorance' and the lack of education
and general knowledge of local people at that time

You are so profoundly ignorant. But then you're a
Strat, so we'd be amazed if you were otherwise. You
have not the faintest grasp of the extent of the social
divisions of the time, nor why -- if the Queen decided
to fund Shakespeare, and his company of actors,
entirely from her own funds (as was virtually the case,
allowing for some complicated accounting) -- she
could do so with scarcely a dent in her resources.

&quot;Elizabeth often used her private roads out of London: the King's
Road on the north bank though Chelsea, which led to Richmond
and Hampton Court, the road from Lambeth Ferry, along the
south bank to Greenwich and Eltham, and Theobald's Road,
leading north to (among other places) Cecil's great palace.
But the heavy stuff, and often the Queen herself, went by barge
when her destination had a river frontage. . .&quot;

***One reads Crowley--if one reads Crowley at all--only for momentary
diversion from the other longeurs of existence. Crowley's technique is to
make off-the-cuff assertions consistent with his cherry-picked idea of how
things are or were, and then to leave it to others to do the research he
owed us to have done himself before making any assertions in the first
place. As this research to which Crowley-answerers have fallen heir, and
finding appropriate sources to cite, and putting it all together in a
message, is often tedious and time-consuming, and one's reward for doing so
is only to be dragged by him into further unnecessary and difficult or
recondite research, and/or inane bluster from Crowley, or (more rarely but
more attractively) his silence, few venture to undertake the matter--alas
leaving him to crow that people don't refute him and so he must therefore be
right. One thus might wish that he would base his notions of success not on
a failure to be refuted but rather on the presence or lack of people's
positive expressions of agreement with him.

opinion, still in the depths of my ignorance, I would generally phrase
it in the form of a question, appealing to the knowledgeable and those
better-educated in the subject at hand, in hopes of either being
intuitively correct, or else gently corrected in my misapprehension.
I don't think I would ever attempt an incursion into foreign
intellectual territory, while barking loudly any plausible idiocy that
might come to my uninformed mind.

I could be mistaken; you could be some sort of expert on 16th century
matters of inland transportation. You might be indirectly quoting an
expert on 16th century matters of inland transportation. You might
even be mistaken and indirectly quoting a self-proclaimed expert on
16th century matters of inland transportation who was in fact no such
thing. But your method of expression leads me toward my initial
impression, which is that you are talking quite violently out of your
ass.

If my impression of your mode of discourse is correct, I ask that you
please reconsider it. It seems to me a design contributing to an
increase in the sum of ignorance in the world.

&gt; American experience in the 19th century is not
&gt; a reliable guide for England in the 16th, Tom.
&gt; I appreciate that you may not know that. The virgin
&gt; prairies were usually flat and rock-hard. A well-built
&gt; wagon with good horses could travel well over them.
&gt; Whereas the ground in England was often soaked
&gt; and boggy, and became hopelessly chewed up. No
&gt; one ever built a good road from Stratford to Coventry
&gt; before about 1830. The Romans didn't and there
&gt; was no one else who was willing to put in the time
&gt; and money. That's why they dug a canal to Stratford
&gt; sometime around 1800.

"/>

and here's a nice poem...

The Rolling English Road

Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.

I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,
And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;
But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed
To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,
Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,
The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.

His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run
Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?
The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,
But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.
God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear
The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.

My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,
Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,
But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,
And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;
For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,
Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.

You must be an academic or sumtin. You have
this touching belief that the world is full of 'experts'
who really know stuff, and the rest of us should stay
silent until they have spoken. Dave Kathman is the
closest around here, and were we all simple good
Stratfordians, we'd just hang on his every word.

Well, it's not like that. We routinely discuss topics like
this around here, and 'experts' never seem to appear.
(Or when they do, they invariably seem to fall flat on
their respective faces, as Dave has demonstrated
so often -- and as he is in the process of so doing
yet again.)

We have to rely on our own scraps of knowledge. They
are not trivial, since nearly everyone around here has
read the literature of the day -- especially Shakespeare,
Many of us have read quite a bit of history of the period
and contemporary correspondence. We do know --
roughly -- how often people at the time referred to
'taking a coach' or 'using carriages' or seeing 'such-
and-such in his/her coach'. So -- to a large extent --
it's a process of checking the communal knowledge
around here. Or that's what it should be.

If there are records of anyone travelling by coach (or
carriage) or of routinely moving goods by cart between
Stratford and Coventry -- or between two roughly
equivalent English towns of the period -- then there
is a fair chance that someone here will know of one.

But so far -- nothing.

In fact, it is more than that. This issue has come up
here and been discussed, several times in recent
years. In between those times I have kept my eyes
open for statements on travelling around the midlands
at that time; (I am sure others have done the same).
I have seen nothing to support the idea of travel by
coach (outside the London area), nor the regular use
of carts over long distances. Litters appear to have
been the principal mode of travel for upper-class
ladies and invalids until the end of the 16th century:

&quot;Her [Countess of Shrewsbury] visit to London in the winter of
1591-2 was partly for the purpose of equipping Hardwick, and
in the week ending 4 December she paid out the large sum of
£425.4.5 . . . . ' . . satin silk for my Lady Arbella.' At this time a
litter was made for the Countess, which must have rivalled the
Queen's it was such a grand affair: the hangings of tawny velvet
and tuft taffeta, with deep gold fringe and fringes of tawny silk,
silver and gold . . . . &quot;
(A.L. Rouse, *Elizabethan Renaissance* page 104)

We are currently discussing the statement by Michael
Wood on BBC TV that 'Shakespeare's family took young
William to Coventry to see the Mystery Plays'.

That is, of course, a flat lie. He made it up. But not
merely is the story pure fabrication, it is also a virtual
impossibility -- yet it is absolutely typical of the
Stratfordian nonsense we are constantly asked to
swallow.

The Stratfordian conception of rural life around 1570
in the English midlands has no basis in reality.
That's inevitable, of course. If they had any idea as
to what it was like, then they would hardly be
Stratfordians.

Paul.

It's not that strange; the Chinese invented wheelbarrows c. 100 B.C.,
though they'd had wheeled vehicles for centuries before that.
Wheelbarows didn't appear in Europe for almost a thousand years, and the
early Europeans would have had more use for them than the Aztecs -- so
far as I can remember from my studies, neither Mesoamerican builders nor
farmers would have greatly benefited from wheelbarrows.

Nope. My role in these kinds of matters is to question
statements made by Stratfordians -- asking on what
authority they make them. Here the statements were
by Michael Wood in his TV programme. Idiot
Stratfordians assume that they are correct, and the
idiotic Dave Kathman chimes in with his support.

We have focussed on one: -- that the Shakespeare
family would have taken the young William to Coventry
to see the Mystery Cycle.

In fact, the family had probably never heard of those plays,
and the idea of anyone going so far to see such a thing
would have been inconceivable.

Stratfordians have such a weak understanding of history
and the social and economic conditions of Early Modern
England that Wood's nonsense is quite unexceptional --
indeed it's standard, unremarkable -- and not remarked
upon. The history is bad because Strats need it to be
bad -- in much the same way as Creationists need bad
science. Their crazy beliefs do not belong in world
where their supporting 'facts' can face the light of day..

If families like the Shakespeares took jaunts to &quot;big
festivals&quot; (like the Mystery Plays), in places as far as
Coventry from Stratford, then there should be plenty of
historical records showing that. Some would have
recorded it in letters, memoirs, etc. Some would have
got involved in legal trouble in those towns -- getting
murdered, raped or robbed, or being involved in fights.
So where are the records?

If traders took carts (or carriages) from one town to
others twenty miles away, there should be records.
Where are they?

They exist only in the idiot minds of Strats, who think
16th-century England is similar to modern up-state
New York.

Well, I can't cite the book, but I'm sure I read that the tom-toms
these primitives used for communication could sometimes be heard as
far as thirty miles away. Aside from that, there were tom-toms in
various places between Coventry and Stratford that could have relayed
messages. So it IS plausible that the Shakespeares had heard about

I agree. In fact, I don't think there WERE any mystery plays
performed in Coventry. Their existence was invented by latter-day
Christian mythologizers. And as for traveling almost twenty miles to
see ANYthing . . . why, my gosh, it'd take a mule four weeks! And the
mule could eat grass along the way; any human beings traveling with
him (and slowing him down) would have starved!

An indication of the way in which the richest, and
most noble of all, routinely travelled at the end of
the 16th century can be found in this account from
Paul Johnson's book on Elizabeth (page 427):

&quot; . . The next month [in 1599] the Scots ambassador, Beltreis, reported
she had been furious with Hunsdon when the latter imprudently protested
that it was unwise for 'one of her years' to ride horseback all the way
from Hampton Court to Nonsuch. 'My years?' she replied. 'Maids! To your
horses quickly.' She refused to speak to Hunsdon for the next two days.
Of course many of her courtiers were now elderly themselves, and found
both the range and the speed of her progresses excessive. But the
Queen was obdurate. White reported from Nonsuch: 'The lords are sorry
for it, but her Majesty bids the old stay behind, and the young and able to
go with her.' . . .&quot;

It would seem that it was not common practice to
travel by coach -- even for the elderly Queen and
her elderly courtiers -- between two of her major
London palaces.

We can take it that the rest of the nobility and
the upper classes would not have behaved any
differently.

So can we forget the Stratfordian idiocy of
Shakespeare's family taking him to Coventry to
see the Mystery Plays?

. . . No. I thought not. Illusions have to be
maintained somehow.

&gt; Well, it's not like that. We routinely discuss topics like

&gt; We have to rely on our own scraps of knowledge. They
&gt; are not trivial, since nearly everyone around here has
&gt; read the literature of the day -- especially Shakespeare,
&gt; Many of us have read quite a bit of history of the period
&gt; and contemporary correspondence. We do know --
&gt; roughly -- how often people at the time referred to
&gt; 'taking a coach' or 'using carriages' or seeing 'such-
&gt; and-such in his/her coach'.

"/>

Paul Hentzner, a tourist from Germany, sometime between
1597 and the death of Burleigh in 1598, took a coach tour
from London to Cambridge to Oxford and back to London. A
translation of his account is given at:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So -- to a large extent --
&gt; it's a process of checking the communal knowledge
&gt; around here. Or that's what it should be.

&gt; If there are records of anyone travelling by coach (or
&gt; carriage) or of routinely moving goods by cart between
&gt; Stratford and Coventry -- or between two roughly
&gt; equivalent English towns of the period -- then there
&gt; is a fair chance that someone here will know of one.

"/>

Hentzner indicates that he went from Cambridge
to Potton to Ampthill to Oxford. (Passing through
the towns of Woburn, Leighton, Aylesbury and Wheatley.)

Looking at an online map, the distance from Potton
(described by Hentzner as a village) to Ampthill
(a town) is apparently around 17 miles which seems
to be comparable to the 19 or so miles between
Stratford upon Avon and Coventry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But so far -- nothing.

&gt; In fact, it is more than that. This issue has come up
&gt; here and been discussed, several times in recent
&gt; years. In between those times I have kept my eyes
&gt; open for statements on travelling around the midlands
&gt; at that time; (I am sure others have done the same).
&gt; I have seen nothing to support the idea of travel by
&gt; coach (outside the London area), nor the regular use
&gt; of carts over long distances.

"/>

And that's supposed to be enough to let you know
what the facts of the matter are?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Litters appear to have
&gt; been the principal mode of travel for upper-class
&gt; ladies and invalids until the end of the 16th century:

"/>

According to

horse litters were traditional for &quot;sickly men and women
of quality&quot;. I should think the fact that 16th century carts
and wagons had no springs had something to do with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Her [Countess of Shrewsbury] visit to London in the winter of
&gt; 1591-2 was partly for the purpose of equipping Hardwick, and
&gt; in the week ending 4 December she paid out the large sum of
&gt; £425.4.5 . . . . ' . . satin silk for my Lady Arbella.' At this time a
&gt; litter was made for the Countess, which must have rivalled the

&gt; silver and gold . . . . &quot;
&gt; (A.L. Rouse, *Elizabethan Renaissance* page 104)

"/>

Queen Elizabeth reportedly went on progression with 400 wagons
in her train. I know that at least once, she made it as far as
Warwick which I take to be an indication that the roads in
Warwickshire were perhaps not as bad as you seem to think
they were.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We are currently discussing the statement by Michael
&gt; Wood on BBC TV that 'Shakespeare's family took young

&gt; That is, of course, a flat lie. He made it up.

"/>

I haven't seen Wood's documentary, but I would
assume that he was making what he thought was
a reasonable inference. (Shakespeare was
Shakespeare. Shakespeare was acquainted with
the Coventry Mystery Plays. Therefore Shakespeare
and family went to Coventry.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But not
&gt; merely is the story pure fabrication, it is also a virtual

&gt; The Stratfordian conception of rural life around 1570
&gt; in the English midlands has no basis in reality.

"/>

The usual conception of the roads, Stratfordian or otherwise,
is that they tended to be bad. I have read that some were
little more than bridle paths, but it seems to me that
the roads going to Coventry would likely be better than
that. I'm also guessing that market towns had an
interest in keeping their roads in relatively good
shape. Therefore, I don't see why it's a &quot;virtual
impossibility&quot; for a late 16th century family to have
travelled in a cart from Stratford to Coventry.

I should say I don't know that how well Shakespeare
was acquainted with the Coventry Mystery plays. And
even if he was, I don't see how that implies that
his whole family went to Coventry.

On the other hand, if Elizabeth means that I do not generally take

He says that they &quot;left London in a coach in order

It would be useful to see the original Latin and have
an opinion from a Latin scholar on it as to his exact
meaning but, as things stand, I don't accept your
reading -- nor, for that matter, his account as we have
it. Hiring a coach for such a journey would have been
extremely expensive, and probably quite impossible.
It's not like hiring a car. The horses have to be
changed, and replaced with others that are trained
for pulling coaches. You don't pick them up on any
old cross-country run.

I suggest that they left for Cambridge on a fairly
regular 'service' -- not unlike the stage-coaches of
later years, and that they then hired horses and
made their way across country to Oxford, changing
horses every so often, in the usual way.

For all we know, they may have walked most of the
way. This guy was writing up an account that was
meant to look good -- to boost the reputation of the
employer he had at the time, and for any future one
he might get. The coach might only have taken
them to Burghley's house (or to nearby Hoddesdon),
to impress the people there. It seems that they did
not hear of the man's death, nor of his funeral, until
they got there.

She was at Charlecote (near Stratford) in 1572 and
at Kenilworth -- Leicester's 'palace' in 1575. Someone
should put up maps of her progresses on a website
sometime. I'm sure that the roads were fixed for her
in advance. Apparently flowers are put out on the

he goes anywhere, and then removed immediately

What did Coventry need that Stratford had -- or
vice versa? Such townlands were self-sufficient,
growing their own food, brewing their own beer,
spinning their own wool, weaving their own cloth,
making their own clothes, own furniture, etc. etc.
Take a look at a map of England and you will
see some good roads, still in existence since
the Romans -- Fosse Way (not far from Stratford
and Coventry), Icknield Street, Watling Street,
and so on. But towns seem to ignore them.
They didn't need such roads. Their economies
were not geared into any serious long-distance
transport. If there was a port or a major market
for their produce, good roads would have been
maintained -- as, say, feeding into London.
But there was nothing like that around Warwick.
They would have 'exported' some livestock --
on the hoof -- but little else.

I do not either, of course a lot depends on what time of the year

I'm really sorry to hear that, Dave. As Tom Reedy has remarked
elsewhere, h.l.a.s. is now entering a new Golden Age of comedy, ushered
in almost single-handedly by Elizabeth Weird. It's truly a remarkable
performance -- Elizabeth manages to combine, in a *single* individual,
the dysfunctional memory of Richard Kennedy, the magisterial prose style
of Mr. Streitz and Mr. Parisious, the hapless historical cluelessness of
Stephanie Caruana, the farcical fabrications of what &quot;must&quot; have been so
(uttered as pompous pontifications and &quot;supported&quot; not by any evidence
but by bumbling, belligerent surliness) of Mr. Crowley, the linguistic
incompetence of Art Neuendorffer, the manic exhibitionism and the vast
vocabulary of &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker, the obsessional monomania and paranoia of
PWDBard, the deficient reading comprehension of Okay Fine, the
lexicographic incompetence of Pat Dooley and Art Neuendorffer, the
attributional acumen of Dr. Stritmatter, the web-grepping comic
credulity of Art Neuendorffer, and the wide-ranging extracurricular
crankery of &quot;Dr.&quot; John &quot;moon hoax&quot; Faker, Mr. Paul &quot;AIDS is a hoax&quot;
Streitz, Ms. Stephanie &quot;Gemstone&quot; Caruana, Mr. Paul &quot;aquatic apes&quot;
Crowley, _et al_, along with her own vivid hallucinations. It's quite
an amusing spectacle. One can only hope that she will write a book.

&gt;&gt; translation of his account is given at:

Why is that?

says that in THE CHRONOLOGY OF BRITISH HISTORY
the daily distance a coach(in 1730) travelled, without
changing horses, is said to have been 34-45 miles
(depending upon the condition of the road).

William Harrison(1577) wrote that the

Our cart or plough horses (for we use them
indifferently) are commonly so strong that
five or six of them (at the most) will draw
three thousand weight of the greatest tale
with ease for a long journey, although it be
not a load of common usage, which consisteth
only of two thousand, or fifty foot of
timber, forty bushels of white salt, or
six-and-thirty of bay, of five quarters of
wheat, experience daily teacheth, and I have
elsewhere remembered.

But of course he doesn't say how fast they were
going or now long the &quot;long journey&quot; was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You obviously think that anyone driving a
coach needs to sometimes change horses.
From later accounts of stage travel, it
looks like a team of horses driven at 8 or
9 miles per hour could make it 15 miles
without too much trouble. Let's say the
conditions were dry and Hentzner's party's
coach was averaging 2 or 3 miles an hour.
(Given the indisputably rough condition of
the roads and the lack of springs, I can't
imagine too many people wanting to go much
faster.)

Why would they ever need to change teams?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

the coach.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

On the last leg, they travelled from London
to Whitstable by boat. From there, they
walked to Canterbury, a distance of around
7 miles. Hentzner said that that made
them tired. I suspect that if they'd walked

Oxford and back to London, a 7 mile jaunt

That allows us to date the trip precisely,

In 1617, Orazio Busino, chaplain to the Venetian
ambassador travelled with the ambassador by
coach. From what I've read on the web, it seems
that their itinerary included Oxford. The coach
was often stuck in the mud and once, it broke
down. They supposedly spent 6 days going 150
miles. The incident peaked my interest, so
I've ordered Peter Razzell's _The Journals of
Two Travellers in Elizabethan and Early Stuart
England: Thomas Platter and Horatio Busino_
from amazon.co.uk. My confirmation email says
I should be reading it in 4-6 weeks. (I don't
expect this thread to last that long.)

From everything I've read so far, it looks
like the big problem with Midlands roads
was water. If you can show that the 16th
century roads between Stratford and Coventry
were all marshy or crossed rivers without
bridges or ferries, I dare say you'll have
pretty well proved that John did not likely
take his family to Coventry in a cart.
Otherwise, I think you are simply
generalizing beyond what can be reasonably
generalized.

&gt;&gt; horse litters were traditional for &quot;sickly men and women

&gt;&gt; and wagons had no springs had something to do with that.

&gt; Agreed. Horseback was probably a lot more
&gt; comfortable than most carriages or coaches
&gt; -- unless it was a very good road.

&gt;&gt; Queen Elizabeth reportedly went on progression with 400 wagons
&gt;&gt; in her train. I know that at least once, she made it as far as
&gt;&gt; Warwick which I take to be an indication that the roads in
&gt;&gt; Warwickshire were perhaps not as bad as you seem to think
&gt;&gt; they were.

&gt; She was at Charlecote (near Stratford) in 1572 and
&gt; at Kenilworth -- Leicester's 'palace' in 1575. Someone
&gt; should put up maps of her progresses on a website
&gt; sometime.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

IIRC, every able bodied adult male was supposed

&gt; They were suppressed in 1579 when the Stratman

John Shakespeare was twice accused of illegally
buying large quantities of wool. (5600 pounds

that to mean that he, from time to time, had a
lot of wool to sell. I'm sure he could have
sold it all to local weavers. For that
matter, I suspect he could have wool traders
who were passing through on their way to
Coventry or London. On the other hand, I'm
sure the raw wool prices were higher in
Coventry and I don't doubt that John

No, he didn't. I can't recall what he said in the TV programme, but in his
book he says: &quot;Eighteen miles from Stratford - an easy day's trip on
horseback - lay ... Coventry. [...] In the late 1560s, when William first
rode in as a boy, perhaps sitting in front of his father's saddle [...]&quot;.

I must confess that the trip by carriage was my own flight of fancy: in an
earlier posting I wrote &quot;I suppose the son of a leading citizen might have
got a lift on a horse or even in a bumpy carriage&quot;. Characteristically, Paul
Crowley ignores the first more plausible suggestion and latches on to my
&quot;even&quot;. By the way, I did not suggest that there was a family trip to
Coventry - only that the family would probably have had a means of
transport. (NB 'carriage': the word 'coach' suggests something rather too
grand - one point on which Paul and I can agree.)

The point Wood is speculatively making concerns the influence of the Mystery
plays on Shakespeare' style, something which has always seemed to me very
probable, if only in his characteristic mingling of tragedy and comedy. Wood
also cites allusions to the performance style of the Mystery plays, such as
Hamlet's &quot;out-Herods Herod&quot; (he quotes an outrageous passage of rant from
the Coventry Massacre of the Innocents), and a quotation from them in R2:
&quot;Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? So Judas did to Christ.&quot; (The
'All hail' is not biblical.)

Wood says, and it seems a fair judgment, &quot;He [Shakespeare] echoed and
plundered them [the Coventry Mysteries] to powerful emotional effect in
themes, images, words and staging, knowing that their old imaginal world was
still there in the minds of so many of his audience&quot;.

He tells of the sights in which they were interested:

about the journey between Cambridge and Oxford is:

&quot; . . Potton, a village. Ampthill, a town; here we saw immense
numbers of rabbits, which are reckoned as good as hares,
and are very well tasted. We passed through the towns of

We have to postulate something, in order to make
sense of what he says . . . tough as some of us
may find that. We are agreed that unsprung coaches
were uncomfortable except on good roads. They are
also much more liable to wear and damage. There
has to be some kind of infrastructure for all transport
systems -- inns, stabling, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,
and so on, so that when,say, a wheel comes off, it
does not take many days to be fixed. Those 'services'
probably existed between Burghley's house and
London, and may have extended to Cambridge
although I doubt that. There would have been plenty
of traffic with carts, bringing in vegetables, etc, to
London, going out as far as about Cheshunt. They
would not have needed to go out much further.

There was, almost certainly, little 'infrastructure' at

Cambridge and Oxford.

"/>

It is a remarkable fact that they left London on the
morning of such a great funeral, and turned up at
the house of the deceased, apparently expecting
a friendly reception on the one day that year when
they could be guaranteed not getting one. It suggests
that their spoken English was virtually non-existent
(not in the least surprising) that they met no well-
connected German-speakers in London (perhaps
unsurprising at that time of year), and that their
communication with the natives through other
languages was minimal.

They appear not -- in their whole time in England
-- to have met a single person whose name was
worth recording. Since the author's Latin can be
presumed to be reasonable, it does not say much
for the much-vaunted-around-here knowledge of
Latin of the natives.

My guess is that they were turfed out of their London
inn on the morning of the funeral -- because more
important guests were expected to arrive that day,
and the inn-keeper fixed up their jaunt out with a
coachman who had just brought mourners in from
Theobalds. (It might have been a way of enticing
these inconvenient foreigners to leave.) The coach-
man was probably returning there anyway. In effect,
the court was re-assembling for a few days, possibly
briefly re-opening their London houses -- or maybe
not. The travellers probably spent their first night out
of London at an inn in Cheshunt, Hoddesdon or
Ware, and continued on horseback thereafter. With
better connections they would have stayed in London
and met some courtiers, but in fact they were treated
merely as exploitable foreigners.

&gt; From everything I've read so far, it looks

You are missing the point that it all depends on

Since a trader could never rely on them he'd stick
to pack-horses. He simply would not possess carts.

&gt;&gt; If I assume that William Shakespeare

&gt;&gt; his father is more likely than a family trip.

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; Did Wood actually say that John Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; brought his whole family to Coventry?

&gt; No, he didn't. I can't recall what he said in the TV programme, but in his
&gt; book he says: &quot;Eighteen miles from Stratford - an easy day's trip on
&gt; horseback - lay ... Coventry. [...] In the late 1560s, when William first
&gt; rode in as a boy, perhaps sitting in front of his father's saddle [...]&quot;.

&gt; I must confess that the trip by carriage was my own flight of fancy: in an
&gt; earlier posting I wrote &quot;I suppose the son of a leading citizen might have
&gt; got a lift on a horse or even in a bumpy carriage&quot;. Characteristically, Paul
&gt; Crowley ignores the first more plausible suggestion and latches on to my
&gt;&quot;even&quot;. By the way, I did not suggest that there was a family trip to
&gt; Coventry - only that the family would probably have had a means of
&gt; transport. (NB 'carriage': the word 'coach' suggests something rather too
&gt; grand - one point on which Paul and I can agree.)

"/>

You've made me replay the tape of the first
programme -- something for which you owe
me a large favour. (I had better things to do
than see the second -- or even bother to
record it.)

Wood says (his exact words):

&quot;When he was a boy his parents took him to
Coventry to see the Mystery plays.&quot;

So the 'family trip by carriage' (or the family
jaunt up the motorway) is quite reasonable
in Wood's version of Stratfordia -- if entirely
unreasonable in any historically sound one.
(No doubt Wood's programmes will be played
endlessly in tourist centres in Stratford-upon-
Avon. Wood may be angling for an advisory
role in some kind of Disney-Stratfordian theme
park. I can see a combined Mickey Mouse /
Stratman going down well. Do they have
stooges dressed up as the Stratman -- with the
bald bulging head etc., -- going around the town
reciting sonnets? If not, why not? -- And, btw,
I claim my commission for the idea.)

However, there were, beyond any shadow of
a doubt, no carriages in Stratford at that time.

&quot;Beyond any shadow of a doubt&quot; - a large opinion, but perhaps you know more
than any of us about transport in the 16th century.

Whether, as Wood said, WS was taken by his parents to Coventry we don't, and
probably can't, know. It's a reasonable deduction, however: internal
evidence from the Works indicates that he was acquainted with the Mystery
plays; there was little likelihood of his ever seeing a script; the plays
were suppressed when he was in his teens; little boys are unlikely to travel
eighteen miles and back unaccompanied. Put all that together, and Wood's
statement
seems sensible enough.

You are rather hard on Wood's TV series, especially for someone who insists
on so extraordinary an interpretation of the Sonnets, depending on what to
the rest of us seem wild surmises and forced double-meanings. Wood is not
engaged in original scholarship, but in using visual means to suggest what
lay behind the creation of the Works; he takes a fundamentally orthodox
view, and would not have been given four hour-long slots if he had hummed
and hawed with &quot;might&quot; and &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;conceivably&quot;.

The book is more cautious, but is again not an attempt at ground-breaking
research. He simply summarises, and brilliantly illustrates, what
specialists have to say: in his lengthy list of Further Reading he mentions
especially Schoenbaum, Honan and Duncan-Jones on WS's life.

The variation of Lend-a-loo called &quot;water-closet waggon&quot; might

OK, when you start by assuming the truth of a crazy
theory, then almost anything can follow. If Genesis
is true, then all those animals _must_ have fitted
into the Ark.

A more sensible approach would be to look at all
the far-fetched consequences and ask if the basic
theory might be false. But we know that for many
that approach has to be ruled out -- on religious
grounds.

Actually, neither are criticisms that are made of
my exegeses. Forced meanings are easy to spot.
J. W.Kennedy pointed some out a couple of weeks
ago in an exegesis of Sonnet 104 by &quot;Phil&quot;. Neither
he nor you (nor anyone else AFAIR) has pointed
out any in mine. Likewise for 'wild surmises'.

'Brilliantly illustrates'? He has this guy, with
extensive Catholic connections -- with close
relations executed for treason, writing a play on
the deposition of monarchs . . not even being
questioned . . and, in fact, being feted at court
(except that there are no historical records to
show the events).

It's standard Stratfordian 'History for Idiots' -- made
worse (hard as that is to conceive) by the Catholic
slant he attempts to add -- and by the relating of
pure speculation as simple fact.

Surely any child can see that the whole story is
nonsense? -- That it bears as much relation to
reality as 'Mickey Mouse'?

Wood is an idiot thrashing about in dark, more-or-
less randomly picking from a selection of fanciful
stories (he goes for Forman's Lanier as the 'Dark
Lady') -- to produce a concoction as absurd as any
that has ever been ladled out to the public as 'history'.
Yet there is not a trace of admission that what he
says is other than solid fact. Who do the BBC think
that they are trying to fool? What is the sense of
putting out such garbage? Is there a market
somewhere (in the USA?) that finds the least
expression of uncertainty disturbing?

In 1592, the actor Simon Jewell made his will (Prerogative Court
of Canterbury 63 Harrington, proved 23 August 1592), in which
he made bequests to various &quot;fellows&quot; in the acting company
in which he was a sharer. Jewell itemized the various sums of money
that were owed to him as well as his debts to others. The first
two items among the sums owed to Jewell were as follows:

&quot;Imprimis due vnto me Simon Iewell from my fellowes for my share
of apparrell the somm of thirteene pounde six shillinges eighte
pence. Item more due unto me from my fellowes the sixth parte
of thirtie seaven pounde wch amounteth to six pounds three
shillinges fouer pence, and haue paide my share for horses
waggen and apparrell newe boughte.&quot;

Thus, the sharers in this company shared the costs of
&quot;horses waggen and apparrell&quot;. I don't know why they
would split up the cost of a &quot;waggen&quot; unless they used
it to travel from town to town.

There are plenty of other references to travelling players
using carts or wagons to carry their costumes and props,
but this is the most explicit one I could put my hand to
quickly. It will make absolutely no difference to Crowley,
of course, but I thought I would post it for the
benefit of others.

&gt; No, now you're doing the famous Crowley shuffle.

&gt; Here's exactly what you said:

&gt;&gt; It's a low priority. MAYBE I'll get around to it, but I am
&gt;&gt; not taking bets. Dave's 'historical facts' may usually be
&gt;&gt; accurate, but the conclusions that he draws are as bad
&gt;&gt; as any. One example from this thread: &quot;Also, both towns
&gt;&gt; were on the regular circuit that traveling players had been
&gt;&gt; taking since at least the late middle ages; these players
&gt;&gt; were traveling with carts loaded with costumes and props,
&gt;&gt; and they somehow managed to make the trip on a
&gt;&gt; routine basis. . . .&quot;

&gt;&gt; He has no basis for &quot; . . traveling with carts . .&quot;.

&gt; IOW, you said Dave had no basis for saying that acting companies traveled
&gt; with carts or wagons hauling their props and costumes on a regular circuit
&gt; that included Stratford and Coventry.

&gt; Now you admit they used them, but you want to change what you clearly
&gt; stated, which was wrong (like so much of what you post on hlas).

"/>

Arguing with Elizabeth Weir, or corporate life in
America, or Alzheimers, or something, must be
affecting your brain. You were never this stupid
before.

Most people in most kinds of business at the time
used carts. But they did not often, let alone regularly,
use them for long distance travel on country roads.
The roads were rarely up to it. Got that? Is it difficult?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact that they used them on those roads -- which you now admit

"/>

Where do I admit that?

This thread started with Wood's idiotic statement
(note the title). It spread to 'trips by carriage from
Stratford to Coventry', then to whether carts could
move on that road, and then we had Rod's &quot;coach
tour&quot; around Southern England.

Alan Jones later suggested &quot;perhaps sitting in
front of his father's saddle&quot;. But even that is unlikely.
People like the Stratman's father could not afford to
take days off for such events. (One day to get there,
another at it and to rest the horse, another day to get
back.) And his affairs were on the slide at this point.
Perhaps if he was really selling wool, then his son
might help to look after the pack-horses. But that would
be two days walk there, and two days to get back. It's
very unlikely that he'd have a deal that would coincide
(if he was dealing at all, and at this time).

All this is important to try to get a handle on the nature
of rural life at the time -- dominated by the raw necessity
to survive . The Stratfordian absurdities pedalled by
Wood, Dave Kathman, yourself and Stratfordians
generally, arise out of the need to create a fantasy
world, in which you can place your fantasy author.
The fantasy trip to Coventry is merely one of a few
hundred (or thousand) fantasy events, necessary to
your scenario. An examination of any of them shows
up their absurdity. But you can never remember that.
For you, each one illusion remains constantly in its
state of pristine (but unperceived) unreality. You
already know what Alzheimer's is like.

Thanks for that, Robert.

Among the ~200 carriers we have these which indicate
wheeled transport:
Bury (Suffolk) wagons -- Thursdays
Cambridge -- wagons or coaches
come on Thursdays and Fridays
Chelmsford (Essex) -- wagon -- come Wednesday
Chippenganger (Essex) -- wagons -- come Wednesday
Dunmow (Essex) -- wagons -- come Wednesday
Hertford town -- wagon or coach come every Friday
Hadham (Herts) -- carrier or wagon
come and go Mon, Tues, Fri, Sat;
Hatfield -- wagon or coach -- come every Friday
Gloucestershire (sundry places) -- wains or wagons --
every week at the Swan
Ingarstone (Essex) -- wains -- come Wednesdays
Saffron Walden (Essex) -- wagon -- at The Bull on
Tues, Wednesdays
St. Albans -- coach -- arrives Fridays, leaves Tuesdays
Stock (Essex) -- wains -- come Wednesdays
Watford -- wagon -- Thursdays
Winchester -- wagon -- Thursdays
Ware -- wagon -- Friday and Saturday

We must remember that this 'schedule' comes from
the providers -- and like the modern British railway
system -- would often represent hopes rather than
expectations. Many of the services seem to me to
be combined -- for example, there are a suspiciously
large number of services out of Essex arriving on
Wednesdays.

Likewise, the 'wagon or coach' to Hatfield, Hertford
and Cambridge on Fridays is IMO probably the same
one -- since Hatfield and Hertford are on (or close to)
the route to Cambridge. It probably also covers the
wagon to Ware on Fridays.

Only one coach service, as such, is offered -- that to
St Albans. Since wagons are very different from
fully sprung coaches, I think we get a feeling for the
way in which both were regarded as forms of
personal transport -- i.e. people much preferred
horseback

Allowing for a certain amount of exaggeration, this list
provides a useful snapshot of the transport system
of 1637. That's sixty years after our date (of &quot;Shake-
speare's parents taking young William to Coventry&quot;) --
but I doubt if the road system had changed much in
that time. In summary: carriers (i.e. packhorses) were
the standard system. Only where roads were good --
mostly those radiating from London for a distance
of about 50 miles -- would we expect to find any
regular wheeled traffic.

To me, the evidence seems to add up that transportation by coach
may have been rare, but that roads were there supporting traffic
by wagon and cart, as well as horseback. There were evidently
Roman roads still in use. That the need for roads was recognized
is demonstrated by the public responsibility to maintain roads by
doing assigned regular repairs; and there is documented evidence
that &quot;In 1611 he (Shakespeare) was one of a number of citizens
who contributed to the maintenance of highways in the Stratford
area; . . .&quot;

I find the need and use of roads beyond &quot;local&quot; traffic is
described in terms of economy involved in the phenomenon of
hording produce for sale in distant markets. Seems that sly
merchants recognized they could get better profits by not selling
locally but instead delivering to other markets at higher prices
while raising prices by not selling. Wasn't Shakespeare doing
this when he was storing grains and waiting for prices to raise?

In Coriolanus, I, i, we have the situation, apparently recognized
as usury:
(quote)
First Citizen

Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

and

MARCIUS
. . . .
What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS

For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
The city is well stored.
(unquote)

In characterizing Shakespeare as a crusty businessman, Diana
Price reports that, &quot;Many of Shakespeare's business records
involve mercenary activities. In 1598, Shakespeare was hoarding
commercial quantities of grain during a famine.&quot;

So, not only was the importance of roads recognized by the state,
but Shakespeare participated in their maintenance; and a
particular motive for attending to roads between marketing
centers was an economy favoring transportation and hording of
produce for greater profit, in which Shakespeare was possibly
participating despite awareness of it as a form of usury.

And how do you know that Shakespeare was a) even interested in

All we know is that he had a certain quantity of malted barley
at his residence in Stratford at a certain time. Given that the brewing
of beer was a commonplace for homeowners at the time, this
does not seem to be the slightest bit unusual.

From one of Xrob's old posts:
&quot;As I have previously noted in other posts, going by William Harrison's
1577 recipe, the 10 quarters of malt in Shakespeare's barn could have
been used to brew about 2000 gallons of beer, which, judging from
reports of Elizabethan per capita beer consumption, was enough to satisfy the
yearly thirst of 6-8 adult Elizabethans. The New Place
was reportedly the second largest house in town and it came with two
orchards. It therefore seems probable that(in 1598) the Shakespeares
were the employers of a number of servants, each of which would have
been entitled to food and drink. If we knew how many, we could
estimate how much(if any) of the malt might have been surplus to the
Shakespeare household needs.&quot;
(12/6/2002, thread &quot;mild surprise&quot;, posted by X ... @pXcr8.pXcr.com)

also, from another of his posts:

&quot;William Harrison in his Description of England (1577),
described brewing in his own household.

Harrison said that his wife, with the help of her maidservants, brewed
beer once a month. Each time, according to Harrison's recipe, she
used eight bushels. Therefore, the Harrisons would have ran through
the Shakespeare malt supply in about ten months. (10 quarters =
80 bushels).&quot;

From Holinshed's Chronicles, about hording and inflating prices:
(quote)
Another thing there is in our markets worthy to be looked into,
and that is the recarriage of grain from the same into lofts and
cellars, of which before I gave some intimation; wherefore if it
were ordered that every seller should make his market by an hour,
or else the bailey or clerk of the said market to make sale
thereof, according to his discretion, without liberty to the
farmers to set up their corn in houses and chambers, I am
persuaded that the prices of our grain would soon be abated.
Again, if it were enacted that each one should keep his next
market with his grain (and not to run six, eight, ten, fourteen,
or twenty miles from home to sell his corn where he doth find the
highest price, and thereby leaveth his neighbours unfurnished), I
do not think but that our markets would be far better served than
at this present they are. Finally, if men's barns might be
indifferently viewed immediately after harvest, and a note
gathered by an estimate, and kept by some appointed and trusty
person for that purpose, we should have much more plenty of corn
in our town crosses than as yet is commonly seen: because each
one hideth and hoardeth what he may, upon purpose either that it

He is indeed. Crowley apparently doesn't know that the Coventry
Mystery Plays (performed as a part of the Corpus Christi festival)
were not merely a theatrical event. Instead they were a part of the
Coventry Corpus Christi market, an eight day market that - in the
Middle Ages, at least - was apparently the largest annual market in
Warwickshire (it was originally known as the &quot;Trinity Fair&quot; and dated
from 1218). Coventry's dominance in Warwickshire was subsequently
threatened by Birmingham, but Coventry's Corpus Christi market was
still a major and important one in Shakespeare's time.

Since John Shakespeare lived less than a day's journey from Coventry,
and was capable of doing deals worth a couple of hundred pounds in
Shakespeare's childhood, it is fairly obvious that he would have been
a regular visitor to the Corpus Christi market in Coventry. He would
have found an opportunity there to sell his own goods, and to purchase
the raw materials that he needed. Crowley's infantile and idiotic
belief that nobody ever set foot outside Stratford if they lived there
during the Renaissance is frankly comical. John Shakespeare was a
merchant, and his major markets would have been outside his own
village, especially since he was dealing in luxury goods. Purchasers
from Coventry and across Warwickshire, and beyond, were available at
the eight-day Coventry market.

Far from &quot;taking a day off&quot;, John Shakespeare would almost certainly
have gone to Coventry (taking his son) to trade at the Corpus Christi
market. The Corpus Christi pageants would have been an added bonus.
Just in case Crowley's next argument is that he would only have
attended the market, and not the pageants, we only need to point out
that the pageants certainly had an enormous audience, and ask who
exactly he thought was watching them if not the people attending the
Corpus Christi market? - (and John Shakespeare paid players to perform
in Stratford when he was Bailiff and two of his sons became actors, so
it seems rather likely that he enjoyed watching plays when he had the
chance). Of course the pageants were also religious events, and if
John Shakespeare was a good Catholic or just old fashioned in his
beliefs (which has not been proved, but either one of these two things
is possible) then he would have been particularly keen to combine his
economic interests with his spiritual and leisurely ones.

Just as Crowley's life is made up entirely of his desperate hunt for
food, with starvation the only alternative, and no time to visit the
nearest town (let alone London). Stop talking melodramatic
unhistorical twaddle, Crowley.

People who owned three houses, hundreds of acres of land, and could
spend a couple of hundred pounds on wool in one transaction (as John
Shakespeare did) were not &quot;dominated by the raw necessity to survive&quot;
anymore than the lives of Crowley or the rest of us (despite us being
comparatively much poorer than John Shakespeare) are today. In fact
it seems fairly obvious from what Crowley has told us about his own
life that Crowley is a &quot;near peasant&quot; compared to the wealthy merchant
and bailiff John Shakespeare, if we compare their rank and status in
their own societies. John Shakespeare was a rich merchant, and even
when he reached rock bottom of his financial troubles he apparently
had no difficulty maintaining his (large and expensive) household or
keeping his family fed and clothed. The idea that he did nothing
unless it put food on the table is hilarious. Incidentally, a trip to
the Corpus Christi market in Coventry would have put food on the
table.

Crowley, you dimwitted lunatic, have you ever read your own postings?
You are apparently incapable of reading even the most basic history
book, and just pull your entire theories and arguments out of your
voluminous (and filthy) backside. Virtually nothing that you write is
based on knowledge of the Renaissance period (of which you are almost
entirely ignorant, as you apparently are about everything), you just
make it all up (while screaming loudly about how nobody is as clever
as you - on the contrary I wonder whether anybody is so stupid).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The fantasy trip to Coventry is merely one of a few
&gt;&gt; hundred (or thousand) fantasy events, necessary to
&gt;&gt; your scenario. An examination of any of them shows
&gt;&gt; up their absurdity.

"/>

Since there are no documentary records associating Oxford with
Shakespeare's works (unless you throw away the documents and write
your own fantasy versions) it is fairly obvious that every single
Oxfordian argument is based on &quot;fantasy events&quot;. Crowley is of course
congenitally stupid and of dubious reason, so his fantasies are
usually more extreme and ridiculous than most (apparently the Queen
engaged in shitting contests with Oxford, and then lapped up his poems
about them - actually the Queen kicked Oxford out of court and didn't
ever give him any jobs to do, which hardly suggests such a close - not
to mention perverted - relationship: one wonders who Crowley shits on
mirrors with, to believe that such things are acceptable and normal
behaviour, and whether his wife knows).

Incidentally, just to finish off the point about people travelling
about to markets, there was a horsemarket in Stratford, which was
rather obviously a much more minor event than the Corpus Christi
market in Coventry. Despite this, and despite the fact that Stratford
was only a village rather than a major trading town like Coventry,
records of the purchasers and sellers of horses at this Stratford
market show that people routinely came fifty miles or more to trade
horses at Stratford. &quot;Traders came from as far as a hundred miles
away, and for two or three days Stratford was full to capacity&quot;.
Records were kept because a toll was levied on every sale. The
records given in Jeanne Jones's &quot;Family Life in Shakespeare's England&quot;
(from which the above quote is drawn) show people trading in Stratford
from county Gloucester, Morton Morrell in Warwickshire, Oxfordshire,
Leicestershire, and Northamptonshire. Doubtless Crowley would tell
all these people that as rural dwellers in Renaissance England they
were engaged in a desperate struggle for survival, and so could not
possibly attend horse markets in Stratford. As so often, despite
Crowley's edicts about what Renaissance people *MUST* have done, or
*CANNOT* have done, the real people in the real Renaissance ignored
him and carried on travelling and trading as they had always done.

One day Crowley will realise that he is not God. It will come as a
terrible shock to him. After that he might learn that what he thought
was sensible behaviour at the age of three when he was potty training
is not something that any properly developed adult considers
reasonable or amusing (again, one wonders whether Crowley is still
potty-training even now). Hopefully this will happen before he copies
the &quot;comedy terrorist&quot;, barges into some Royal event, and tries to
persuade Queen Elizabeth II to join him in shitting on mirrors so that
he can write some Sonnets about it.

I've just had a look in Wood's book at the further details of that 200
pound wool transaction. It turns out (yet again) to give Crowley's
delusions about what *MUST* have happened in the Renaissance a good
kicking in the teeth.

At a time when Shakespeare was eight years old (plenty old enough to
see and remember the Coventry pageants), his father was charged with
ilegal wool dealing. What is important here is not just the enormous
sum of money involved (John Shakespeare was apparently so rich that he
could spend 210 pounds on one transaction, purchasing two tons of
wool, rather obviously proving that his life was not &quot;dominated by the
raw necessity to survive&quot; - he could have kept himself on survival
(workman's) wages (7d a day for an unskilled worker, enough to live
and keep a family on) for about twenty years with this money if he had
just wanted to use his money to survive) but the place at which the
purchase took place. Despite the fact that John Shakespeare bought
the wool from a fellow Warwickshireman, the transaction took place at
the Westminster Wool Staples, a major trading fair for wool, in
London. Since Crowley idiotically denies that John Shakespeare might
even have left Stratford to do business in the local backyard
(Coventry was very close to Stratford), he might just find it
difficult to explain what the same man was doing going all the way to
a London market to make an agreement that he could have made in
Warwickshire (rather obviously both Shakespeare and the farmer he
bought the wool from expected to travel to markets way outside their
own areas - the fact that they ended up making a deal with people from
their own region was presumably coincidental). I would also point out
that you would almost certainly need wheeled transport to bring two
tons of wool from London to Stratford, or even between two
Warwickshire villages.

Since John Shakespeare showed no signs of being in financial trouble
until 1578 (when Shakespeare was fourteen - in 1575 John was
apparently still rich, since he invested 40 pounds in two houses that
he had no intention of living in and which he rented out), it seems
obvious that Shakespeare and his father could certainly have gone to
the Coventry market and pageants on Corpus Christi at any time in
those years. Actually, contrary to Crowley's ignorant and imbecilic
fulminations, there seems no reason to believe that John Shakespeare
would have stopped trading at any time (although he may no longer have
had hundreds of pounds to spend), since he must have continued to earn
his daily bread by working as a glover, and he would surely have
continued to sell his goods and purchase materials at the major annual
markets. Coventry was Stratford's backyard, and although Crowley with
his &quot;peasant&quot; fantasies about Renaissance life doesn't believe anybody
set foot outside their village, the historical records prove
otherwise.

If John Shakespeare could travel to markets in London, he could
certainly travel to markets in Coventry which were much closer and
more important to the local economy.

I made a minor mistake here, but as it might give solace to Crowley's
delusions about Stratford, I should correct it.

Stratford was not a village, but a small market town (in fact, after
typing these words myself, I see from Schoenbaum that Camden described
Stratford in exactly these words &quot;a handsome small market town&quot;).
Coventry, of course, was by contrast a very large market town (one of
the biggest towns in the country).

&gt; Since I specifically identified &quot;touring acting troupes&quot; as the users of the

You quoted

That site shows _vast_ 'pageant wagons' -- huge
platforms which were substitute stages, with six wheels
(of about 5 foot diameter). &quot;Scenes could be created on
each cart, and then changed by simply wheeling the old
scene (cart) out, and wheeling the new scene (cart)
in. . . .&quot;.

The notion that acting companies around 1580 'toured'
with such vehicles -- to places like Stratford-upon-Avon
-- is next to insane. It simply did not occur to me that
you were putting forward such an idea. It's like saying
an aircraft carrier could go on the Stratford-upon-Avon
canal.

I apologise. I completely underestimated the extent of
your ignorance and your stupidity.

The carts that Dave Kathman was talking about were
the next level up from packhorses -- basic two-wheeled
vehicles with which -- on decent roads -- a horse could
pull more than it could carry. I readily accept that such
carts might have been used -- even into Stratford-upon-
Avon in the 16th century -- after the roads had been put
into good order (as for a royal progress). A touring
company of players MIGHT, with good information, have
been able to plan ahead a circular tour with such carts,
going through Stratford. But GENERALLY they would
not have been able to rely on the roads being in a good
enough condition on such a tour, and it is unlikely that
they would have risked a touring plan based on carts.

However, the question is whether or not a local trader
would have routinely used carts or pack-horses on
such a road. He had to make a choice. He had to
invest in either one or the other.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In characterizing Shakespeare as a crusty businessman, Diana

&gt;&gt; She doesn't know anything about &quot;hoarding&quot;, neither does anyone
&gt;&gt; else on this planet.

&gt;Better take a look at the bit below from Holinshed.

"/>

I did. Holinshed doesn't know that Shakespeare was hoarding
either. Shakespeare seems to have had on hand the a normal
amount of malted barley for household brewing needs. If he were hoarding,
why would he hoard malted barley? Surely unmalted barley, or
wheat, or corn would be more marketable to the hungry, if he
was trying to take advantage of a famine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;and a
&gt;&gt;&gt;particular motive for attending to roads between marketing
&gt;&gt;&gt;centers was an economy favoring transportation and hording of
&gt;&gt;&gt;produce for greater profit, in which Shakespeare was possibly
&gt;&gt;&gt;participating despite awareness of it as a form of usury.

&gt;&gt; What nonsense! Roads are useful to everyone, including buyers.
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare may just as easily have wanted better roads so
&gt;&gt; that he could buy cheaper malted barley for his household use.
&gt;From Holinshed's Chronicles, about hording and inflating prices:
&gt;(quote)
&gt;Another thing there is in our markets worthy to be looked into,
&gt;and that is the recarriage of grain from the same into lofts and
&gt;cellars, of which before I gave some intimation; wherefore if it
&gt;were ordered that every seller should make his market by an hour,
&gt;or else the bailey or clerk of the said market to make sale
&gt;thereof, according to his discretion, without liberty to the
&gt;farmers to set up their corn in houses and chambers, I am
&gt;persuaded that the prices of our grain would soon be abated.
&gt;Again, if it were enacted that each one should keep his next
&gt;market with his grain (and not to run six, eight, ten, fourteen,
&gt;or twenty miles from home to sell his corn where he doth find the
&gt;highest price, and thereby leaveth his neighbours unfurnished), I
&gt;do not think but that our markets would be far better served than
&gt;at this present they are. Finally, if men's barns might be
&gt;indifferently viewed immediately after harvest, and a note
&gt;gathered by an estimate, and kept by some appointed and trusty
&gt;person for that purpose, we should have much more plenty of corn
&gt;in our town crosses than as yet is commonly seen: because each
&gt;one hideth and hoardeth what he may, upon purpose either that it
&gt;will be dearer, or that he shall have some privy vein by bodgers,
&gt;who do accustomably so deal that the sea doth load away no small
&gt;part thereof into other countries and our enemies, to the great
&gt;hindrance of our commonwealth at home, and more likely yet to be,
&gt;except some remedy be found.

"/>

Holinshed says that some persons hoarded &quot;corn&quot; [wheat, barley, oats
in Elizabethan parlance], and travelled far to sell it. This doesn't change
the fact that roads made commerce easier, and that for every seller who was
travelling to sell his corn dearer, there was a buyer travelling to buy his
corn cheaper. The market is a country-wide phenomenon, in some areas the corn
was going for more than the average, in others, less. What does anything
Holinshed say have to do with 10 quarters of malted barley in Shakespeare's
cellar? Was Shakespeare planning to take time off from his theatre
duties to travel to Stratford, then transport his 10 quarters of malted
barley six, eight, ten, fourteen or twenty miles to make a possible
tiny profit? Or pay an agent to do so and have even less profit? According
to Harrison, he valued his 8 bushels of malt at 10 shillings. At 8 bushels
a quarter, this means that Shakespeare's malt was worth about 5 pounds.
A considerable sum in those days, but how much profit could he reasonably
expect by selling only 10 quarters? Would it be worth the effort?

Wouldn't it make more sense that, because Shakespeare had a family, and
because, as Harrison says &quot;the winter half is thought most meet for that
commodity [malt]: howbeit the malt that is made when the willow doth bud is
commonly worst of all...&quot; (IOW, you can't get good malt all year round), that
Shakespeare simply reserved some malt for his household use? If there were
famine
conditions, wasn't Shakespeare's family subject to the same famine? Wouldn't
a prudent husband make sure there was enough food on hand to supply his
family in the event of hard times? Especially if he were away in London
much of the time? Note that Harrison spent a pound a month on beer, or 12
pounds a year, when his income was only 40 pounds a year. Beer must have
been a significant source of calories for the Elizabethans, and therefore
for most it was an essential, not a luxury.

Dave has cited one document that proves that one

obvious. The cart most likely intended to move
costumes and props about while on tour.

Alternatively, one could suppose that the cart was
meant to move costumes and props only about London

Would any Elizabethan acting company have played

&gt;&quot; . . Potton, a village. Ampthill, a town; here we saw immense
&gt; numbers of rabbits, which are reckoned as good as hares,
&gt; and are very well tasted. We passed through the towns of
&gt; Woburn, Leighton, Aylesbury, and Wheatley. . . &quot;

&gt; Clearly they spent the minimum amount of time
&gt; travelling through these uninteresting places.

Actually, if you had a group of people with luggage,
it seems to me that a coach might easily have been
the cheapest way to get from one place to another.

I note that when they went to Dover they left two
companions behind and that on the way to Dover
they had at least 2 companions plus a guide with
them, so it is entirely conceivable that their
party on the Cambridge-Oxford part of the trip
contained 7 or more people.

Quartermasters in the American Civil War considered six mules to have
the hauling power of four horses. A packmule's load was limited to
about 200 pounds, but when the cargo was in wagons, the regulation
load for a six-mule team was 4,000-4,500 lbs. on a macadamized road;
3,000-3,500 lbs. on a solid dirt road; 1,800-2,500 lbs. on a dirt
track in rough country. The wagon also held several hundred pounds of
grain to feed the team, not counted in the load weight. So wagons
would start to be attractive if the cargo was over 1,000 lbs. or too
bulky for saddlepacking. (Source: E. Hagerman, &quot;The American Civil

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many written references would convince you that touring

&gt;&gt;&gt; They used them alright. The question is whether
&gt;&gt;&gt; or not they'd have taken them along country roads
&gt;&gt;&gt; unfit for any kind of wheeled transport.

&gt;&gt; Since I specifically identified &quot;touring acting troupes&quot; as the users of
the
&gt;&gt; wagons, it is implicit in my statement that they used them for touring.
Any
&gt;&gt; other interpretation of my statement -- which you now seem to be trying
to
&gt;&gt; do -- is dishonest.

&gt; You quoted
&gt; http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Depts/HUA/TT/Globe/12.html
&gt; That site shows _vast_ 'pageant wagons' -- huge
&gt; platforms which were substitute stages, with six wheels
&gt; (of about 5 foot diameter). &quot;Scenes could be created on
&gt; each cart, and then changed by simply wheeling the old
&gt; scene (cart) out, and wheeling the new scene (cart)
&gt; in. . . .&quot;.

&gt; The notion that acting companies around 1580 'toured'
&gt; with such vehicles -- to places like Stratford-upon-Avon
&gt; -- is next to insane. It simply did not occur to me that
&gt; you were putting forward such an idea. It's like saying
&gt; an aircraft carrier could go on the Stratford-upon-Avon
&gt; canal.

&gt; I apologise. I completely underestimated the extent of
&gt; your ignorance and your stupidity.

&gt; The carts that Dave Kathman was talking about were
&gt; the next level up from packhorses -- basic two-wheeled
&gt; vehicles with which -- on decent roads -- a horse could
&gt; pull more than it could carry. I readily accept that such
&gt; carts might have been used -- even into Stratford-upon-
&gt; Avon in the 16th century -- after the roads had been put
&gt; into good order (as for a royal progress). A touring
&gt; company of players MIGHT, with good information, have
&gt; been able to plan ahead a circular tour with such carts,
&gt; going through Stratford. But GENERALLY they would
&gt; not have been able to rely on the roads being in a good
&gt; enough condition on such a tour, and it is unlikely that
&gt; they would have risked a touring plan based on carts.

&gt; However, the question is whether or not a local trader
&gt; would have routinely used carts or pack-horses on
&gt; such a road. He had to make a choice. He had to
&gt; invest in either one or the other.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The fantasy trip to Coventry is merely one of a few
&gt;&gt;&gt; hundred (or thousand) fantasy events, necessary to
&gt;&gt;&gt; your scenario. An examination of any of them shows
&gt;&gt;&gt; up their absurdity.

&gt;&gt; Coming from someone who believes the sonnets celebrate two people taking
a
&gt;&gt; shit together and watching their turds fall by a reflection in a mirror,
&gt;&gt; this is incredible indeed.

&gt; When one of the parties is the Queen, isn't the idea
&gt; amusing? Did the poet lack a sense of humour?
&gt; Obviously you do. You probably have same the

Interesting. Thanks.

However, the carts that we are talking about in
Elizabethan England were not the sort in use by
those armies. They would have been of the most
basic sort, much more crudely made, unsprung,
with wooden bearings, and probably pulled by a
single horse. The efficiencies gained would have
been much lower.

Considering that there was little change in the English road era
until the turnpike days; if nobody travelled in the days of
Shakespeare nobody travelled in the 18th century either.

Also requirements for fresh horses date from the coaching days.
Stage Coaches travelled at up to 15 mph. Somewhere I have got figures
for tractive effort of horses, it falls off rapidly as speed
increases. At walking pace (3 mph approx) a horse could do 20 miles a
day, day after day. The load a single horse could pull was a function
of the surface.

Certainly true. It is interesting to note that Crowley thinks you

on mirrors is a suitable subject for romantic poetry (and romantic
poetry that he thinks is about the Queen by one of her grovelling
Earls, furthermore!).

And of course Crowley offers no evidence of massive roadbuilding
before (or indeed whilst) Elizabeth moved around the country. If such
&quot;progress&quot; roadbuilding was happening, then royal orders would have to
have routinely been sent to town councils to carry out this work
months before the Queen arrived (Crowley surely doesn't believe that
there was a line of men throwing rocks in the road six feet in front
of the royal wagon train). I have never seen any of these royal
orders, and I wonder if anybody else has. If not then I would guess
this is because no such special work was routinely carried out.

Anyway, I'm sure Crowley will use the same excuse to explain how 27
cartloads of valuable material were taken from Canterbury to London
after Thomas Beckett's shrine was dismantled by Henry VIII. Again,
there is nothing to suggest that massive roadworks were involved, but
Crowley loves to dream.

Then there is the testimony of Alan Smith in &quot;The Emergence of a
Nation State&quot;. He tells us that &quot;Road transport, despite its cost
disadvantages compared with river and sea carriage, was the basis of
most trades and most notably of the wool trade, which remained of such
fundamental importance to the economy throughout our period. Early
modern English roads have traditionally had a bad press from
historians, but it has recently been argued that they may have been a
good deal better than used to be thought, and certainly the sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries saw improvements in the vehicles which
used the roads, with the introduction of much larger wagons, capable
of carrying substantial quantities of goods about the countryside&quot; (p.
176). You may notice that not only are these wagons carrying goods
&quot;about the countryside&quot;, not just around London and within major
towns, as Crowley has tried to claim, but that they were &quot;much larger&quot;
than their mediaeval predecessors, and carried &quot;substantial&quot;
quantities of goods. You might also notice that they were apparently
used especially frequently for the wool trade, so John Shakespeare
surely had access to them when he planned to transport two tons of
wool across the country.

Of course Crowley hates people who know more than he does, and
routinely denounces experts (he has, in the past, tried to suggest as
if it was something that everybody knew, that experts are less likely
to be right about particular subjects than people like Crowley who
can't even be bothered to look in a single book before making enormous
claims about how it *MUST* have been in the past - Crowley isn't just
ignorant, he celebrates his ignorance). Alan Smith has however
apparently read both the original material that supports his
conclusions and the academic papers which analyse it for modern
readers. Crowley hasn't even opened a single book.

"/>

&quot;Much larger wagons&quot; were routinely being used to travel around the
countryside carrying wool and other goods, according to Alan Smith.
Why shouldn't the players have turned one of these wagons into a
portable prop/costume basket? McMillan and Maclean in their book on
the Queen's Men use the same record as Dave Kathman to show that the
constantly touring company (which used the Midlands as a route to the
North on one of their regular touring routes) probably had &quot;each actor
... [bringing] his own box or trunk of costumes on the road, these
would take up much of the space in the wagon specified as part of the
troupe's expenses&quot; (the will specifies a box of costumes). It is to
be noted that this company spent very little time in London at the
time the will was made, and that the vast majority of their work took
place in huge national tours. The idea that they bought wagons
expressly to work an area within a couple of miles of central London,
as Crowley would like to believe, is pretty much absurd.

No. They doubtless used wagons. Alan Smith says that they were in
regular use throughout the countryside of Elizabethan England to carry
heavy loads, and the will of an actor in a touring company specifies
that the players were using them.

"/>

Not true at all. The trader probably hired wagons or pack horses for
mass transportation as his needs dictated. John Shakespeare had two
tons of wool to transport at some point, and cannot possibly have
needed the amount of transport that would have required every day.
Besides, John Shakespeare owned hundreds of acres of farmland, and so
would obviously have had access to both farm horses and farm carts and
wagons pretty much whenever he chose (not to mention his own riding
animals for every day use). We don't have John Shakespeare's
inventory, but we do have the inventory for one of his wife's
relatives, a farmer.

Eric Poole's &quot;Shakespeare's Kinsfolk and the Arden Inheritance&quot; in
Shakespeare Quarterly tells us that when Alexander Webb of
Snitterfield died in 1573, his house contained &quot;eight looms ... a
cart, a wagon with iron bound wheels, a tumbril, harrows and ploughs&quot;.
Since the roads in Snitterfield would have been much more basic than
those in Stratford, I wonder to myself exactly where Crowley thinks
this wagon would have been used? My own guess is that it routinely
travelled along roads (both inside and outside the village) and even
off-road, in the fields. Since Crowley is now suggesting that
Shakespeare could not have owned his own cart, it seems odd that a
much poorer relative had a cart, a wagon, a tumbril, and horses. John
Shakespeare, incidentally, was overseer to Alexander Webb's will.
Since he owned hundreds of acres of famland, John Shakespeare must
either have owned carts, or been master to those who did.

Finally, on the question of whether carts used roads outside London,
it is worth noting that William Harrison in his &quot;Description of
England&quot;, writing about roads in England for travelling long distances
across the country - and certainly not just those within town
boundaries or within London - states that &quot;whereas some streets within
these five and twenty years have been in most places fifty foot broad
according to the law, whereby the traveller might either escape the
thief, or shift the mire, or pass by the loaden cart without danger of
hiself and his horse&quot; now they are too often covered with &quot;boughs&quot; and
undergrowth, so that they are too narrow.

You will note that Harrison expects the &quot;traveller&quot; (and nobody
wandering around inside their town boundaries is a traveller) to come
across &quot;loaden
cart[s]&quot; and suggests that it is now difficult to pass them without
endangering himself or his horse. He does, however, expect the
traveller to meet these carts and to pass them. He just doesn't
expect him to like it.

I also note that Crowley has suggested that a carriage journey in the
Midlands would be impossible because of the lack of wheelwrights.
Jeanne Jones in her &quot;Family Life in Shakespeare's England&quot; (a study of
Stratford folk from Shakespeare's time) tells us that there were five
professional wheelwrights in her sample of Stratford folk living from
1570-1630, and these are just the ones that appear in the records that
she has used.

It seems we can add yet another to the list of Crowley fantasies that
has been roundly refuted by reality, the idea that nobody could travel
outside their home town on a wheeled vehicle is nonsense.

Here's a good example of the Strat style, this long, long discussion
of carts and whistles. It began with Paul Crowley's post which said in
part:

&quot;Another story: &quot; . . Shakespeare's parents took him to Coventry to
see the Mystery plays . .&quot;. Somehow Wood forgets to mention that
Coventry is nearly 20 miles from Stratford, a good two days walk for a
child.

Maybe the young Shakspere of Stratford saw some plays, probably so.
Maybe he traveled 20 miles with his parents to see a play, it's not
important. What is important is that he should have learned to read
and write instead.

However, there's some value to the discussion, as John Shakespeare is
brought into the discussion, with remarks of his large interest in the
wool trade, carting tods and tods of the stuff on the poor roads of
the day. Good for him, and good for Stratford. Both he and the
townsfolk were pleased that an effigy was set up for him in Holy
Trinity, holding a wool-sack to his torso.

When the Strats try to lead the argument into some rut, or muddy path,
this often happens. They forget that they are weak on several fronts,
and the more they talk, the greater danger that their cart is going to
bust a wheel, as you see.

An interesting demonstration of ignorance of transport history. The
main problem with making rivers navigable was the existence of weirs.
Every river in Britain was rife with weirs except the Severn by 1700.
Some were to divert water for water mills others were for fish traps.
Early locks on rivers were not complex they were flash weirs with
removable paddles. Canal type locks were used on cuts which bypassed
parts of the river which was much later.

The canal age started with the Bridgewater canal, by 1800 the
majority of the system had been built and new construction was being
devoted to shortening the contour canals and building the final links
like the Grand Union.

By the way, there was no noticeable difference in English roads
between the Tudors and 1706 when the first Turnpike Trusts were set
up. Before the Turnpikes road conditions in England varied wildly
according to which part of the country you were in and the time of
year.

So Paul's got no answer to that, then. What a surprise! It blows up
his false claims about how far people (particularly John Shakespeare)
travelled and/or traded in the Renaissance, and what vehicles they
used, nicely - but when backed into a corner, make a pointless and
stupid quip (especially if, like Paul, you are pointless and stupid).

Incidentally the wool, according to Wood, was purchased from a
Warwickshire shepherd. So it *was* produced near Stratford, then it
was presumably carried all the way to a London market (as the producer
could not possibly have known who he was going to sell it to in
advance, and he wouldn't have been selling at a London market if he
was only willing to ship it to Warwickshire) and then carried all the
way back to Stratford after John Shakespeare purchased it.

I am puzzled as to what Crowley gains from his attempt to suggest that
this amount of wool couldn't have been used by Stratford industry
(which wouldn't have stopped John Shakespeare keeping it in the
buildings that he owned until he could sell it onwards - or does
Crowley imagine John Shakespeare owning warehouses in London? - which
would nicely destroy Crowley's imagined picture of the &quot;near peasant&quot;
family that never left Stratford yet again). Since the wool was
produced by a Warwickshire shepherd (who quite probably lived in a
smaller community than Stratford, possibly one of the villages) then
obviously Warwickshire as a whole was producing hundreds or thousands
of tons of wool - otherwise two tons could not possibly be produced
and sold by a single individual owner. This wool was obviously being
used for industry, or would not have been produced, and if it wasn't
being used in Stratford alone, then it was obviously being traded to
Warwickshire, London, and the rest of the country, and probably
abroad. In fact there is plenty of historical evidence that the
wooltrade was both national and international, and that it spread
across the whole country (rather obviously it did, or what was the
point in keeping all those sheep?).

Paul may, of course, be so stupid that he believes that Stratford and
Warwickshire shepherds kept their sheep to eat themselves (since they
were &quot;dominated by the raw necessity to survive&quot; in Crowley's
mythological fantasy world, and obviously weren't involved in anything
like trade), and used the wool to knit their own family smocks, and
threw the rest away - never selling anything outside their village.
If this was the case then urban centres like London could not have
existed, and it was the direct result of trade becoming national and
international (and people transporting tons of goods across the
country and back to sell them) that made Renaissance urban life
possible.

But of course Paul lives in a fantasy world, and is apparently only
reading the sections of my posts that other people have copied, so he
has no idea of how life really operated in the Renaissance and frankly
doesn't care. What is the point in reading History books if you can
just make up fairy tales, and shit on mirrors with the Earl of Oxford?

Shakespeare went in on the deal with John Lockesley, also of
Stratford, in 1572,and they paid 14s per tod, or 2800 shillings total, or
140 pounds. Later that year Shakespeare bought another 100 tods
(1.25 long tons) of wool at the same price, costing him 70 pounds. The
total that John Shakespeare spent himself is therefore not known,
(at least from the information that Schoenbaum reports)
although the total that he and Lockesley spent that year was 210 pounds.

Actually, Kennedy, as somebody has already pointed out, a real
woolsack was enormous, and looked nothing like a small pillow. Wool
was, as Wood suggests, bagged up in tods of 28 pounds each, or 12.7
kilos by modern measurements (assuming Elizabethan pounds were
equivalent to modern British pounds). If you can fit 12.7 kilos of
wool into a bag the size of the pillow in the Dugdale engraving and
still have it in salable condition, then you might be semi-rational.
Which you're not.

Of course, since there were much greater and more important woolmen in
Warwickshire and the rest of the country (and John Shakespeare is not
going to have been memorialised for his ilegal backdoors trade in wool
rather than his honest lifelong work as a glover, or his long term
work in the local government) then you can obviously show us all the
other memorials which show the famous woolmen clutching their pillows
full of wool as an indication of their trade. We can show you many
examples of writers with pillows, which match the Shakespeare
monument, if you cannot show us any examples of the sort of monument
that you are fantasizing about, then it seems fairly obvious that
nobody ever made one anything like it. If somebody did want to show a
wool merchant in a memorial, then I would expect him to be much more
likely to be shown alongside a sheep and/or a woman working a loom.
If this was important to my arguments (which it isn't) then I would go
and find some examples of this sort of monument to prove my point.
Obviously Kennedy won't do that, because his point is valueless and

What you seem to have failed to understand is that John Shakespeare
got into trouble for his wool dealing, and clearly wanted to keep it a
secret. Your suggestion that he was memorialised in his local church
clutching a sack of wool is roughly equivalent to the suggestion that
a judge who in his spare time liked to drive his car at 100mph would
expect to be memorialised in his local church with a bust of him
driving at ilegal speeds along the motorway rather than one of him
with his gavel. Which bust do you think is more likely to have been
put up to memorialise such a judge?

Of course it doesn't make much difference to the subject of this
argument whether the wool ever left Warwickshire, since Crowley claims
that transportation of this sort of goods on Warwickshire roads was
impossible (unless he expects us to believe in a rather impractical
*VERY* long train of packhorses). Even if the Warwickshire shepherd
sent the wool from his Warwickshire farm directly to John Shakespeare,
then it would have had to travel down the same Warwickshire roads.
The fact that the Warwickshire shepherd was selling his wool in a
London market, however, proves that he was willing to ship to London
(had it been purchased by a customer from London or Kent, for example
- there is no point of going all the way to a London market to sell
your wool if you are *only* willing to sell to a Warwickshire
neighbour). This means that the wool either made the journey from
Warwickshire to London to be sold, or would have made that journey if
a London buyer had appeared (both of which destroy Crowley's claims
about the extent of travel, trade, and transport in the Renaissance).

I would suggest, without having any firm evidence for my beliefs, that
it would have been cheaper and easier for John Shakespeare, having
purchased this huge quantity of wool with the intention of reselling
it, to move it to the buildings that he owned in Stratford (and part
of his own house has traditionally been known as the &quot;woolshop&quot;),
since a three-day journey by (hired?) wagons would be much cheaper
than the hire or purchase of a London warehouse for weeks or months
until a resale was arranged.

Larque writes this piece of foolishness, believe it or not:

&quot;Actually, Kennedy, as somebody has already pointed out, a real
woolsack was enormous, and looked nothing like a small pillow. Wool
was, as Wood suggests, bagged up in tods of 28 pounds each, or 12.7
kilos by modern measurements (assuming Elizabethan pounds were
equivalent to modern British pounds). If you can fit 12.7 kilos of
wool into a bag the size of the pillow in the Dugdale engraving and
still have it in salable condition, then you might be semi-rational.
Which you're not.&quot;

Well, I'm sure that not another Strat in the world will join Larque in
this sort of nonsense. There is a fine funereal statue of Capt ---- ,
a navigator, and he is holding a globe in his hands. Everyone knows,
of course, that it is a bogus effigy because the circumferance of the
world is 24,000 miles, and they could never even have got it into the
church. You're a silly man, Larque.

&gt;&gt; Thanks to Larque for his promotion of John Shakespeare as a big time
&gt;&gt; dealer in wool, which I have urged on the Strats for a long time, so
&gt;&gt; there is really good hope that the sensible amongst them will
&gt;&gt; understand that Dugdale sketched the Holy Trinity effigy as it
&gt;&gt; originally appeared -- a woolman holding a woolsack, the staple of
&gt;&gt; England.

&gt; Actually, Kennedy, as somebody has already pointed out, a real
&gt; woolsack was enormous, and looked nothing like a small pillow. Wool
&gt; was, as Wood suggests, bagged up in tods of 28 pounds each, or 12.7
&gt; kilos by modern measurements (assuming Elizabethan pounds were
&gt; equivalent to modern British pounds). If you can fit 12.7 kilos of
&gt; wool into a bag the size of the pillow in the Dugdale engraving and
&gt; still have it in salable condition, then you might be semi-rational.
&gt; Which you're not.

&gt; Of course, since there were much greater and more important woolmen in
&gt; Warwickshire and the rest of the country (and John Shakespeare is not
&gt; going to have been memorialised for his ilegal backdoors trade in wool
&gt; rather than his honest lifelong work as a glover, or his long term
&gt; work in the local government) then you can obviously show us all the
&gt; other memorials which show the famous woolmen clutching their pillows
&gt; full of wool as an indication of their trade. We can show you many
&gt; examples of writers with pillows, which match the Shakespeare
&gt; monument, if you cannot show us any examples of the sort of monument
&gt; that you are fantasizing about, then it seems fairly obvious that
&gt; nobody ever made one anything like it. If somebody did want to show a
&gt; wool merchant in a memorial, then I would expect him to be much more
&gt; likely to be shown alongside a sheep and/or a woman working a loom.
&gt; If this was important to my arguments (which it isn't) then I would go
&gt; and find some examples of this sort of monument to prove my point.
&gt; Obviously Kennedy won't do that, because his point is valueless and
&gt; incorrect.

&gt;&gt; Largue wrote: &quot;This wool was obviously being used for industry, or
&gt;&gt; would not have been produced, and if it wasn't being used in Stratford
&gt;&gt; alone, then it was obviously being traded to Warwickshire, London, and
&gt;&gt; the rest of the country, and probably abroad. In fact there is plenty
&gt;&gt; of historical evidence that the
&gt;&gt; wooltrade was both national and international, and that it spread
&gt;&gt; across the whole country (rather obviously it did, or what was the
&gt;&gt; point in keeping all those sheep?).&quot;

&gt; What you seem to have failed to understand is that John Shakespeare
&gt; got into trouble for his wool dealing, and clearly wanted to keep it a
&gt; secret. Your suggestion that he was memorialised in his local church
&gt; clutching a sack of wool is roughly equivalent to the suggestion that
&gt; a judge who in his spare time liked to drive his car at 100mph would
&gt; expect to be memorialised in his local church with a bust of him
&gt; driving at ilegal speeds along the motorway rather than one of him
&gt; with his gavel. Which bust do you think is more likely to have been
&gt; put up to memorialise such a judge?

&gt; Rather obviously your ideas are ridiculous.

What is the origin of the expression 'to pull the wool over one's
eyes&quot;?
January 18 2003

(quote)
Wealthy Brits of the 17th and 18th centuries were fond of wearing
woollen wigs. To punish those engaging in this sissy practice,
brigands would tug their victims' hairpieces down over their
faces, the more easily to relieve them of their pounds and pence.
The practice of wearing wigs continued into the 19th century at
all Britain's colonies (including America and Australia) and came
to be associated with someone who could be easily deceived once
their wig was pulled over their eyes.

David Buley, Seaforth

Medieval fairs were places of wonder and dastardly deeds where
robbers were always on the lookout for victims. Their favourite
technique was to pull the victim's hood over his eyes while
cutting his purse-strings. Hence the expressions to hoodwink and
to pull the wool over one's eyes.

Since the earth is not round but egg-shaped, how is its
circumference be determined? Those demanding a fixed answer will
perhaps say it's equatorial, while others may say polar. Thus,
in some respects, the circumference and the pillow-sack
controversies are like the war over soft-boiled egg dinning
conventions reported in Gulliver's Travels, where little-end
faction open the soft-boiled egg at the small end, and big-enders
open the large end.

The polar circumference is 24902.40 miles. The equatorial
circumference is 24860.48 miles. The average circumference
is 24881.44 miles, and the polar and equatorial diameters
vary by 0.17% from the average value. The difference between
a wool sack and a cushion is, I estimate, about 10,000%.

The SIZE of the wool-sack John Shakespeare is holding is the big
important question according to the Strats. Yet I have seen a picture
of Columbus with the Mayflower tucked under his arm. I doubt if he
could have lifted the poop deck. Then there are pictures of Wm.
Shakespeare floating in the sky. Newton said that such a thing was
impossible, except of course depending on the VELOCITY of the poet.
But to the woolsack.

&quot;That wise man, Sir Thomas Moore...was Chancellor of England and
therefore sat in the House of Lords on a symbolic woolsack....&quot;

&quot;WOOLSACK: This refers to the Lord Chancellor's traditional seat in
Parliament: an oversized hassock stuffed with wool, symbolic of the
nation's former reliance on the wool industry.&quot;

So there it is, KQKnave falls out of the sky and crashes again,

velocity. You've got to be swift to understand symbolic imagery.

However, halfwit Kennedy, I myself own a globe of the same size, which
is a common way of putting a world map into a person's living
quarters. A real Captain would rather obviously be likely to own a
world globe, and it could be used as a symbol of his trade because
worldmaps (even on Globes) helped people to plan journeys and to
navigate the world. Using such a memorial would be no different to
showing him studying paper maps of the French coastline (but France is
enormous, Kennedy, how could you fit it on a piece of paper!) since he
would really use maps and globes in deciding the routes on which he
was to travel.

A wool merchant, however, would be very unlikely to own a pillow
stuffed with wool. He certainly wouldn't use it in his trade, since
it would be both useless and valueless, and he would have no reason to
own it. Can you show us examples of wool merchants in monuments or
anywhere else with pillows full of wool as utilitarian objects? I
don't think so.

You are demanding that we ignore the actual purpose of Shakespeare's
monument (a monument to a writer) and ignore the tradition of real
monuments of writers showing them writing on a pillow and instead
descend to the unsupported fantasy that a wool dealer (and John
Shakespeare would not have wished to be memorialised as a wool dealer,
anymore than Oxford would have wanted to be memorialised in the act of
sodomising a small child) could be memorialised clutching a small
pillow that was (in your mind) supposedly full of wool as a symbol of
his trade.

Since the monuments in the Stratford church are in no way
revolutionary and exceptional in their depictions of people, there is
no reason to believe that they would show a person's trade in a way
that no other monument in England ever did. So if you want to support
your claims (and make them even semi-rational) then find these other
woolmerchants clutching woolsacks the size of pillows in their
monuments. You won't find any, because nobody ever made such a
monument. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it. Until you do, your
claims are valueless.

&gt;We must remember that this 'schedule' comes from

&gt;expectations.

"/>

No, not from the providers. Taylor put it together against
considerable resistance from them; they suspected he was a potential
competitor, or else looking for a way to put a tax on them (see the
introduction). Taylor was seeking to make some money by producing
something useful to the public.(He was the water-poet, a professional
writer.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Many of the services seem to me to
&gt;be combined -- for example, there are a suspiciously
&gt;large number of services out of Essex arriving on
&gt;Wednesdays.

&gt;Likewise, the 'wagon or coach' to Hatfield, Hertford
&gt;and Cambridge on Fridays is IMO probably the same
&gt;one -- since Hatfield and Hertford are on (or close to)
&gt;the route to Cambridge. It probably also covers the
&gt;wagon to Ware on Fridays.

"/>

Perhaps I misled you by saying the services were in alphabetical order
of destination. Strictly, they are in order of origin, of the towns to
which the carriers belonged. So &quot;The Carriers of St. Albans&quot; means
those men who have the profession of carrier who live at St Albans. It
does follow that they would be going to St Albans, but also that they
are distinct from the carriers of any other place, even if it was on
the way to St Albans or St Albans was on the way to it. I do not think
the duplication you posit is real.

In his introduction, Taylor expressly says he does not include
connecting services or possible drops on the way: &quot;Others may object
and say that I have not named all the towns and places that Carriers
do go unto in England and Wales. To whom I yield; but yet I answer,
that if a Carrier of York hath a letter or goods to deliver at any
town in his way thither, he serves the turn well enough: and there are
Carriers and Messengers from York to carry such goods and letters as
are too be passed any ways north, broad and wide as far or farther
than Berwick.&quot;

There was generally a number of carriers at any one place, as is shown
by the odd exception when Taylor says something like &quot;The Carrier of
Coggeshall in Suffolk doth lodge at the Spread Eagle in Gracious
street. He comes and goes on Thursdays and Fridays.&quot; Carriers from the
same town, or district, came and went together in a crowd - obviously
enough - for protection and help on the way and for directions, there
being no sign-posts. So in I Henry IV act 2 scene 1, the second
carrier addresses the first with &quot;Come, neighbour Mugs&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Only one coach service, as such, is offered -- that to
&gt;St Albans. Since wagons are very different from
&gt;fully sprung coaches, I think we get a feeling for the
&gt;way in which both were regarded as forms of
&gt;personal transport -- i.e. people much preferred
&gt;horseback

"/>

There are several types of transport distinguished, and at least one I
would expect to see that is not.
&quot;Clothiers do come every week out of divers parts of Gloucestershire
to the Saracen's Head in Friday street.
The Wains or Waggons do come every week from sundry places in
Cloucestershire, and are to be had at the Swan near Holborn Bridge.&quot;
(From Gloucester to London is 109 miles by today's roads.)

I assume clothiers had some special kind of transport that meant they
could take some return loads for the public but not others. I don't
know what that would be. Pack-horses would seem suitable, but other
carriers too used pack-horses; those in I Henry IV are not clothiers.

Coach-horses were harnessed abreast, but waggon-horses in tandem.
(Pepys' Diary, 1 Nov. 1662, with Latham and Matthews' note and their
Companion volume under 'Travel'). That enabled waggons to use narrower
roads, or roads where the passable part was narrower. &quot;The waggons
carried goods for the most part, but also provided rough and ready
accommodation for passengers. Pepys thought them good enough for his
parents and sister and servants, but not for himself and Elizabeth.&quot;
(Companion).

How a wain differed from a waggon I do not know. (If Taylor means
they are the same, then he also means a waggon is the same as a
coach.) They are separately defined by the Shorter Oxford:

Waggon (1523). 1. A strong four-wheeled vehicle designed for the
transport of heavy goods. 2. A carriage of any kind for the conveyance
of persons, their luggage, etc. (last in 1638). 3. An open
four-wheeled vehicle built for carrying hay ... (1573). 4. A covered
vehicle for the regular conveyance of commodities and passengers by
road (1615). (5-8 are too late.)

Wain (the older word). 1. A large open vehicle, usu. four-wheeled,
drawn by horses or oxen, and used for carrying heavy loads, esp. of
agricultural produce. (2. is Ursa Major.)

The web site

has a picture of a scene at the New Inn, Gloucester, just before
letter H, showing a Type 4 waggon in the background and a two-wheeled
cart in the left foreground. I don't know the date of the picture,but
the cart is very like an early 16th century one shown on a map in the
Muniments of Winchester College, MS 3233 (Harvey, Maps in Tudor
England p.17). That notes the names and areas of a number of fields,
and in the foreground is &quot;The hie Wey ledynge from london to
Basyngstoke&quot;. On the highway is a traveller with three pack-horses (he
rides the last; they are not tied together and so evidently know their
way) and another with a two-wheeled cart drawn by a horse. These must
be meant as typical of the traffic between London and Basingstoke. But
I do not know what Taylor would call such a cart.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Allowing for a certain amount of exaggeration, this list
&gt;provides a useful snapshot of the transport system
&gt;of 1637. That's sixty years after our date (of &quot;Shake-
&gt;speare's parents taking young William to Coventry&quot;) --
&gt;but I doubt if the road system had changed much in
&gt;that time. In summary: carriers (i.e. packhorses) were
&gt;the standard system.

"/>

Hobson, the Cambridge carrier, hired out horses for riding (on the
principle of Hobson's choice) but his carrying business was wheeled.
From Milton's second poem on his death,
&quot;He di'd for heavines that his Cart went light&quot; (line 22)
&quot;Linkt to the mutual flowing of the Seas,
Yet (strange to think) his wain was his increase&quot; (lines 31-2). (This
would date from Milton's Cambridge period, the 1630s.)
Evidently, you could call someone a carrier all the same, even if he
used wheels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Only where roads were good --
&gt;mostly those radiating from London for a distance
&gt;of about 50 miles -- would we expect to find any
&gt;regular wheeled traffic.

The roads round London were little if any better maintained than the
rest (the parishes were responsible), and they got far more wear. They
would be the worst, if anything.

To be more precise, you don't know of any items
and as your theory gains some slight assistance
from the lack, you haven't bothered to look into
the matter.

The inventory of property maker John Carow includes
&quot;Monsters, Mountaynes, fforestes, Beastes, Serpentes&quot;
as well as &quot;heaven, hell, and the devell&quot;. Henslowe's
list is much longer and includes things like trees, horses,
dragons, heifers, tombs, coffins, wooden canopies, bedsteads,
chariots, the &quot;City of Rome&quot; and the like. I suppose if
one was really determined one could pack any of the above
items on a packhorse, but it seems to me that a wagon or
cart would be considerably more practical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Dave has cited one document that proves that one
&gt;&gt; company owned horses and a cart.

&gt; It may have been a 'pageant wagon' -- very useful for

&gt; open fairgrounds, etc..

"/>

There is a description of a pageant wagon at
.
The wagon itself appears to have been 11 feet wide and
15 feet long. That's one heck of a wagon, but even so,
it provided for a stage that was less than 1/4th the
size of the Rose's stage(the smallest of the public
theater stages). It seems to me to be too small to
allow for performances of plays like Shakespeare's,
but what do I know. I'm certainly not a theater
professional. Maybe it's quite doable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Obviously it could only be moved around on good roads,
&gt; such as in the South-East.

"/>

Let me get this straight. You don't think the
roads in the Midlands were capable of taking
4 by 8 foot carts but you see the roads
in the South-East as being capable of taking
11 by 15 foot wagons. Right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If much of their business was at locations
&gt; fairly accessible to good roads then the cost might
&gt; have been justified.

"/>

If what they needed was a portable stage, I don't
see why they wouldn't have chosen to use a stage
that could be broken down so that it could be
carried in the bed of an ordinary wagon. It's
quite obvious that such a wagon would be able to
go more places than could a pageant wagon and if
nothing else, when they weren't using it, they'd
have a wagon that they could hire out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Alternatively, one could suppose that the cart was
&gt;&gt; meant to move costumes and props only about London
&gt;&gt; but the cart and horses cost more than 37 pounds.
&gt;&gt; Would any Elizabethan acting company have played
&gt;&gt; enough different venues in London to make that
&gt;&gt; worthwhile? It doesn't seem too likely.

&gt; Even if it was an ordinary wagon, such an investment
&gt; could have been justified. They travelled so much
&gt; (in the South-East), that the reduction in the hiring (or
&gt; upkeep) of horses would pay their money back.

"/>

How do you know they travelled so much in the
South-East?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not like hiring a car. The horses have to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changed,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The travellers almost invariably want to move
&gt;&gt;&gt; faster than the horses are capable.

&gt;&gt; We're talking about a springless coach moving
&gt;&gt; down a less than perfect road and in such a case,
&gt;&gt; I dare say most travellers prefer a sedate pace.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Horses
&gt;&gt;&gt; can go a long way in one day. But then they
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to be rested.

&gt;&gt; Says who? What's your benchmark for &quot;a
&gt;&gt; long way&quot;?

&gt; The standard modes of travel at the time are well-

&gt; between Rye and London -- about every 20 miles.

It seems that you think that Elizabethan
posthorses and carriages generally moved at the
same rate of speed or you think that how far a
horse could go is independent of how fast it
goes. Either is an absurd notion.

Ken Young, a man who seems to know quite a bit
abou horse transportation, has told us that
horses can walk at a rate of 3 miles an
hour, day after day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Did you forget that as tourists, they would have been

They had to pay for lodging every night they were
in England, so what's additional about paying
for a night in a country inn? If anything, I

&gt;&gt;&gt; Woburn, Leighton, Aylesbury, and Wheatley. . . &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Clearly they spent the minimum amount of time

Generally, when one flies past some place at
a higher rate of speed, one sees less, but

this must be Oxford.&quot; I doubt many(if any)
tourists before the latter half of the 20th
century travelled in such a fashion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But, in fact, they should have known

The situations are not at all analogous. Hentzner

&gt; and eggs, but as near as I can tell, the staples of
&gt; the English diet seem to have been meat, bread,
&gt; beer, cheese, and butter. Personally, I'd be
&gt; pretty surprised if the Londoners were able to produce
&gt; significantly more of any of the staples per acre than
&gt; could the average rural farmer.

"/>

Of course they could -- on a 'per acre' basis.
Ask any allotment holder. (Perhaps 'allotments'
are unknown in the US. But there is an ancient
tradition in England -- in AFAIK all towns and
cities. Well-worked, well-fertilised ground
can be highly productive.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here's your argument in a nutshell:

&gt; Since everyone around you behaves like Hyacinth
&gt; in _Keeping Up Appearances_, surely Paul Hentzner
&gt; was also much like Hyacinth.

"/>

I didn't think 'Keeping up Appearances' would
be on US TV. Hyacinth is, of course, a caricature --
but she reflects a strain of behaviour that is
a constant element throughout British society.
As you will know from the series, class is a
fundamental element to all of Hyacinth's thinking.
I'm sure the _relative_ absence in the US (as well
as the consciously anti-class ideology) is a major
reason for our differing views. Another factor --
which I'm sure is partly related to class -- are the
differing attitudes to (dis)honesty. Americans find
it hard to cope with the least dishonesty. Brits are
usually fairly honest -- but will readily tell 'white
lies' or 'spin' in much the way Hyacinth does.
Many Europeans (especially the French) barely
seem to know what the concept is.

All that may seem outrageous stereotyping (and
I'm sure Bob Grumman will be mystified or horrified)
but I am constantly amazed how often it is borne out
-- as in the debate on the Iraq war -- indeed, such
behaviour is virtually predictable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I can't help but see it

&gt; perhaps I'm off base.

Every Brit knows a Hyacinth -- or someone who
shares a lot of her attitudes. They don't see her
as 'delusional' at all. But can you see her fitting
into the USA?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Would you say that UK soaps
&gt; are renowned for the accuracy with which they
&gt; depict reality?

They mostly present caricatures -- but recognisable
ones. (Linda Snell of the Archers -- a radio soap --
is roughly similar to Hyacinth.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I constantly check what people say against my
&gt;&gt; conception of the way the world works.

&gt; And do you see them as lying more often than
&gt; not?

"/>

As an example, I'm sure Hentzler's account was,
say, ~98% honest. The only 'spin' I detect was his
statement: &quot;We left London in a coach, in order to
see the remarkable places in its neighbourhood . . &quot;
which was IMO strictly accurate but was deliberately
left open to misinterpretation for the benefit of those
such as you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you had a nearly perfect understanding of how
&gt; the Elizabethan world worked, that'd be reasonable.
&gt; Even experts don't have that sort of an understanding.

"/>

Here we have a simple problem: Did Hentzler
and his party do that whole journey by coach or
was he being a tad misleading in his wording?
I really see no problem in deciding. I'd say that the
likelihood that they travelled all that way by coach
is less than 5% -- and probably ~1%. Normally,
of course, we miss these things. It was almost
by accident that we happened to focus on it.

&gt;&gt; Since they got to Theobalds while the funeral was
&gt;&gt; in progress, on what other day could they have left?

&gt; I think that when describing today a group of people who
&gt; left yesterday to attend a funeral to be held tomorrow, one
&gt; might possibly say they were gone attending a funeral.

"/>

Another relevant aspect of this story is that there
was a road out of London highly suitable for
coaches (basically designed for them) -- the
private Queen's road that went to Theobalds.
Burghley's coaches would have been a regular
sight on that road, taking little more than an hour
each way -- with stables and changes of horses
at each end.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that they were shown everything but the
&gt;&gt;&gt; family's apartments which I think was friendly
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough. Were they hoping to see everything?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I really don't know.

&gt;&gt; You really don't get this 'class' thing, do you? They
&gt;&gt; would have been appalled at idea that the term
&gt;&gt; 'friendly' should be applied to their relationship with
&gt;&gt; some gardener or flunkey -- too low to attend his
&gt;&gt; Lord's funeral.

&gt; 'Friendly' is your word, not theirs, but even if we thought
&gt; about putting that word into their mouths, I am not sure
&gt; that they might not term the actions of a flunkey or gardener
&gt; to be friendly. (Or, if warranted, &quot;unfriendly&quot;.)

&gt; Does the word necessarily have such a social connotation?
&gt; If a 17th century Englishman, say Sir George Calvert,
&gt; wrote a letter back to King Charles saying that some natives
&gt; of the New World had behaved towards him &quot;a very friendly
&gt; fashion&quot;, would the King think he was nuts?

"/>

It's very interesting that you REALLY don't get it.
You're not putting it on. Perhaps the best I can
do is to (yet again) draw an analogy with slavery.
No Southern slave-owner would (or could) talk
of being friendly to his slave. There must be
thousands of letters in the archives (say from
the Civil War). I'd bet that in none of them from
the South (and in precious few from the North)
would you find a white talking of friendship with
a black -- or it would be so exceptional as to be
celebrated.

This lack of feeling for 'class' and for 'spin' in the
Elizabethan world is an enormous handicap

If the (traditional and Stratfordian) view was sound
we should see much more evidence of the use of
Latin generally. At the level of ordinary business
done in such a town (or in any city or town) there
is nothing. As regards civic management, there is
nothing -- or next to nothing. Even when you reach
the level of international relations, where frequently
people meet who do not share (or are not comfortable
in) any living language, we find almost no evidence
of the use of Latin -- except occasionally among clerics
and scholarly types.

This is a typical report of the times:
&quot;Throgmorton paid the penalty for his treason at Tyburn. As for
Mendoza, on January 9th [1584] he was invited to meet members
of the Privy Council at the house of the Lord Chancellor. When he
got there he found the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chamberlain,
Burghley, Leicester, Hunsdon and Walsingham assembled to
meet him. Walsingham, who spoke Italian better than the rest,
addressed him. The Queen, he said, was well aware of Mendoza's
efforts to disturb the peace of her kingdom. She knew all about his
dealings with the disaffected Catholics, with the Scottish Queen
and with those who were planning the invasion of England. She
consequently preferred his room to his company and was
graciously pleased to allow him fifteen days to get out of England. &quot;
(Conyers Read, *Burghley*, page 288)

Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, did not speak
English (almost inevitably). Clearly none of the Privy
Council were competent in Spanish. Italian was the
next best. Latin was not considered -- even though
all present had, presumably, at one time achieved
grammar school standard (at least) in the language,
and most would have studied it at university or
received private tuition to an equivalent level.

There is the famous occasion in 1597 when the
Queen is supposed to have responded ex tempore in
Latin to an impertinent address in that language from
a Polish ambassador. It's possible, but the report (in
a letter of Robert Cecil's) sounds greatly exaggerated
to my ears.

What I am saying is that Elizabethans probably
studied Latin in much the same way as we did at
school, and allowing for their younger age (7-13) the
standard they achieved would not have been any
better. We learned next to nothing of any 'use',
and soon forgot all we had learned. So why was
the subject studied? I don't know. I suspect that
it is a little like square-bashing in the army. No one
pretends that it is of any real direct use, and no one
knows why it seems to work. But it does -- so it is
continued.

The Stratfordian story that the Stratman acquired
real competence in Latin in the local grammar
school (assuming that he attended) is pure fantasy.

The true author (whoever he was) was certainly
a good Latinist, and competent in several
languages. His education was a world away from
that received in a provincial school with one
(often-changed) master.

Ho hum, you seem to be one of the people who believe that Shakespeare
did not write the plays. This has nothing to do with the question of
how well Latin was taught or how common it was. Holinshead who seems
to have been the source for the historical plays did not write in
Latin. I have never seen convincing evidence for the theory. Are you
an Oxfordian or a Baconian?

I seem to remember reading that she actually produced several Latin
translations in her own hand, one of them being a gift to her father, and
the hand is clear and easily readable and, after some academic analysis, is
obviously her work.

The problem with kings and queens is that the stuff they write gets
preserved.

The problem with Elizabeth is that she was almost certainly the best
educated woman in Europe.

Try reading David Starkey's 'Elizabeth' (Chatto and Windus, 2000) for more

No doubt! James himself made sure that Shakspere was supplied with a

No one has diminished Shakespeare by stating that &quot;Writing is
rewriting&quot;. I think almost all writers would agree that writing is
rewriting, and why whould we assume that Shakespeare behaved
differently? Yes, Jonson would disagree, and claimed Shakespeare

his works were otherwise different from other writers. Aside from
being better than the other writer's, of course.

This thread has been cross-posted from HLAS

discuss such matters in infinite detail. While the
issues are predominantly literary, they are also
historical, and when the revolution in this topic
hits EM history departments, there will be a few

No one claims that he 'ran a theatre'. Some claim
that he took an active part in a theatre company,
but the actual evidence to support that claim comes
from a tiny number of documents, and many of the
entries on those documents are most peculiar.
Anti-Stratfordians claim that they were contrived
or forged.

Most of the 'history' involved is pure assumption.
Were the plays, in fact, performed in public?
There are records of some seven to nine public
performances, and one short run of 1HenryVI;
some of those records are questioned as
forgeries.

You were simply being, as you so often are, an anti-continuumist. In
this case, you believe that either Shakespeare was a botcher-up of old
plays or a great playwright. But I'm fairly sure that almost all
Shakespeare-affirmers would agree that he was a SOMETIME botcher-up
of old plays, and none including Greg would claim he was that and
nothing else, ever.

At the risk of misinterpreting Reynold's statement, if it is indeed
his, &quot;making material new for a new audience&quot; refers to Shakespeare's
use of source material for the plays, such as Plautus for the Comedy
of Errors or Holinshed for the histories. I don't read it as a claim
about play-doctoring, although, with your agenda, no doubt you see it
only as such.

Thank you for you articulate, well-argued
and researched response. But, as an
example, take *Loves Labours Lost*.
That play was supposedly written 1595/5.
Yet it portrays on the stage the monarch
of a close ally (France) in the long, bitter
expensive war with Spain -- showing him
in all manner of ridiculous postures.

It would have been rather like seeing a play
on Broadway in, say, 1944 which made fun
of Churchill. Or better -- given that the State
was authoritarian, and had full control over
the stage -- rather like seeing a play in
Moscow in 1943 which caricatured Roosevelt
on the public stage.

The idea is next to inconceivable.

It is, in fact, quite easy to work out when LLL
must have been written, and for what occasion
it would have been first performed -- if you know
a little of the international politics between 1575
and 1600, and are aware of how the characters
in LLL are portrayed and who they represent.
(Since the principal ones bear the same names,
they are not hard to guess.)

You finish up with a completely different
understanding of the play -- as against that
portrayed by idiot Stratfordians.

Of course, that is but the start -- the scratching
of the surface. You soon realise that the whole
of the canon might nearly as well be written in
an unknown language for all the comprehension
of it that is passed on to us from the professional
'interpreters' like Germaine Greer.

Paul.

I've just come across an Ordnance Survey map
of the area, and clarified that the river is definitely
not navigable -- nor would it have been around
1600. The river at Charlecote is shallow and not
navigable -- flowing over weirs quite unsuitable
for even the smallest boat. It is on the main
stream of the river from Warwick. There are no
significant small streams flowing into the Avon
below Charlecote which might increase its flow.

(Although I have walked the locality and rowed
on the river, without seeing the map I was not
100% sure of the geography of the area.)

No, no. Let's be clear: there is a long-standing strain in
Shakespearean scholarship that attributes PARTS of plays to
Shakespeare. He is a hired gun and a wordsmith (see the Sir Thomas
More/Hand D theories). He is considered by many of the biggest names
in the field to have taken old plays and punched them up (Ur-This and
Ur-That, right?). He stole, they say, just about every plot and tapped
a thousand sources for this detail or that. Which is fine because it
reveals a well-read ---but never, EVER an erudite--- man. I don't know
where they get all this, but it's very interesting to me because it
seems like the more it happens, the less there is of the Great Genius.
He can't even write his own farewell to the stage without having to
get King James to rustle him up a business report for the details of a
shipwreck that anyone with half an imagination could surmise for
himself.

How do you know what their motives were? What is so hard about

because (1) that is what playwrights then did (and still do, albeit
more subtly), and (2) because that would explain how he learned his
craft? Your assumption of &quot;chronological difficulties&quot; is flawed.
There is no record whatever that indicates any of Shakespeare's plays
was written before the late 1580's, when he would have been in his
mid-twenties. In fact, the only record that we have that certainly
establishes a date for a Shakespeare play (unless a forgery) is the
copy of Titus Andronicus that was published in 1594, when Shakespeare
was 30. The only record we have that definitely establishes
Shakespeare (for the sane) as a playwright is from 1592, when he was
28. (Greene's Groatsworth.) The only references I know of to plays
that may have been by him are Nashe's to Henry VI, part 1, and
&quot;Hamlets&quot; which suggests that versions of those plays were being
performed in 1588 or 1589. For the former and Titus, this makes
perfect sense, chronologically, for these were Shakespeare's least
effective plays, the ones most likely from his apprenticeship as a
playwright. As for the Hamlet, if it was by Shakespeare, and Nashe
seems to make it Kyd's, it makes most sense to consider it an earlier
version of a play we can be fairly certain Shakespeare revised quite a
bit, and which disappeared during the 1590's, which it would not have,
I shouldn't think, if it was the Hamlet we know.

&quot;Shakespeare&quot; was not a &quot;botcher-up&quot; or patcher of old plays
but he did overwrite old plays.

Bacon also overwrote old philosophers.

Bacon is only original in his genius recasting of the materials.
Bacon's reform of science is dependent on the proto-scientific
philosophers of the Italian Renaissance but the genius aspect
is that Bacon added his insights into the inner workings of the
rulings in common law to make science operational.

The same genius is operating in the Shakespeare plays, probably
why his contemporary critics and admirers called Bacon &quot;Proteus.&quot;
Marston went off on a long rant in two volumes on that subject
and it looks like his target is Bacon. Bacon's modern biographers,
especially the scientists, refer to him as &quot;Proteus.&quot;

Shakespeare went to the school near his house even though we have no

Bacon didn't exist in a vacuum. Elizabeth brought Gilbert to
Court and Bacon spent nearly his entire life at Court so it's
inevitable that Bacon would know Gilbert. Gilbert may have
stimulated Bacon's interest in Napier and Stevin. At the same time
Bacon was corresponding with Galileo and Lord Burghley, at least,
was corresponding with Brache.

Bacon was the only philosopher of his era. There were no other
English philosophers between Occam and Bacon and no philosophers
of any interest--one in Flanders whose name I can't think of--a Stoic--
between Erasmus and Bacon. Locke and Descartes came after
Bacon and if you want to know how influential Bacon was on every
philosopher of the 17th and 18th century read their dedications. Bacon
shaped philosophy for the next two hundred years.

Hobbes, the little plagiarist, has been outed for having taken home
some of Bacon's manuscripts that he shouldn't have had--a political
treatise was just restored to Bacon's authorship.

Galileo is brought in as a philosopher to fill in the blank between
Erasmus and Liebnitz because Bacon, after all, has been discredited,
but Galileo was no philosopher.

Here's a snip of Galileo's &quot;philosophy;&quot;

In a letter to Ms friend Father Castelli, dated Dec. 21, 1613,
[Galileo] maintained that the theologian, instead of trying to
restrict scientific investigation on Biblical grounds, should make
it his business to reconcile the phraseology of the Bible with
the results of science.

I'm not objecting to his belief in God, just don't call it a philosophy of
science. And that letter was not written under duress because it's
dated before the Inquisition got him.

Bacon is an essayist but an essayist whose epistemology, phenomenology,
ethics, psychology, political and moral philosophies permeate the
Shakespeare plays. Strats have kept the lid on Bacon--and suppressed
and hidden his authorship evidence--I have a list--but the philosophers
will eventually liberate the plays from the Strats because the plays
are profound philosophical works--the three lines given to Hotspur
that Huxley quoted are &quot;a philosophical system in themselves&quot;

But thought's the slave of life, and life's time's
fool,
And time that takes survey of all the world
Must have a stop.

according to Huxley who was not a bad philosopher himself.

Your experience doesn't count for much, Toby, but I'm not going to
argue about that. You're ignoring, with your argument, that
Shakespeare was an actor. It is easy for the sane to imagine him, as
an actor, touching up some dialogue here and there, then being asked
to fix a scene or two, for his company--then doctoring an entire
play--before trying a play of his own.

Everything is his, Toby. And just about all of it has been known by
scholars to be adaptations of other works for centuries. And changing
plays slightly here and there by actors for different venues has
always been standard. As editing has been for many famous novels. In
the case of all the plays in the First Folio, Shakespeare was their
author, period. Grow up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure that the Avon was not made
&gt;&gt;&gt; navigable from Evesham up to Stratford until the
&gt;&gt;&gt; canal era -- around 1800. And then the work
&gt;&gt;&gt; was only undertaken to connect with the Stratford-
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon-Avon canal. The river is NOT navigable up
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Warwick now. All that stops below Charlecote.

&gt;&gt; In the pictures, the river looks big enough.
&gt;&gt; There are weirs between Warwick and Avon now
&gt;&gt; and it may be that some were there in the 16th
&gt;&gt; century, but I wouldn't count on it.

&gt; I've just come across an Ordnance Survey map
&gt; of the area, and clarified that the river is definitely
&gt; not navigable -- nor would it have been around
&gt; 1600. The river at Charlecote is shallow and not
&gt; navigable -- flowing over weirs quite unsuitable
&gt; for even the smallest boat.

"/>

If the reason for unsuitability is that the weirs
have silted up, then we have no reason to expect that
in 1570, small boats couldn't go up and down that
stretch of the river.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is on the main
&gt; stream of the river from Warwick. There are no
&gt; significant small streams flowing into the Avon
&gt; below Charlecote which might increase its flow.

"/>

In the late 1630s, the navigation on the Avon
was improved so that the stretch of the river
between Tewkesbury and Stratford could take barges
capable of carrying 40-50 tons. Prior to those
improvements, Tewkesbury got 200 pounds each year
from charging tolls(based upon weight) on boats
entering the Avon. I do not know what rate they
charged or how far the boats went up the Avon,
but obviously, if there are no small streams
below Charlecote flowing into the Avon, the
flow at Tewkesbury was equivalent to that at
Charlecote. The inference is that if there
was then a problem getting boats past Charlecote,
it may not have had much to do with a small water
flow. I should note that I wouldn't be a bit
surprised if some stretches of the Avon were
only navigable when the water levels were
higher than ordinary.

If someone had intended to try to keep costs
down by reusing old properties, I would expect
them to first look at the collections of properties

Office of the Works. I certainly wouldn't expect

horses for the purpose of hauling properties
to be used in masques. If nothing else, I don't

On the other hand, they must have had *some*

it goes without saying that boards and barrels were

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There is a description of a pageant wagon at

&gt;&gt; The wagon itself appears to have been 11 feet wide and
&gt;&gt; 15 feet long. That's one heck of a wagon, but even so,
&gt;&gt; it provided for a stage that was less than 1/4th the
&gt;&gt; size of the Rose's stage(the smallest of the public
&gt;&gt; theater stages). It seems to me to be too small to
&gt;&gt; allow for performances of plays like Shakespeare's,
&gt;&gt; but what do I know. I'm certainly not a theater
&gt;&gt; professional. Maybe it's quite doable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously it could only be moved around on good roads,
&gt;&gt;&gt; such as in the South-East.

&gt;&gt; Let me get this straight. You don't think the
&gt;&gt; roads in the Midlands were capable of taking
&gt;&gt; 4 by 8 foot carts but you see the roads
&gt;&gt; in the South-East as being capable of taking
&gt;&gt; 11 by 15 foot wagons. Right?

&gt; Wrong. Those wagons may not have left London.

Ok. You think it's *possible* that the roads in

there was any cart traffic on the 19 or so miles

&gt;&gt; posthorses and carriages generally moved at the

&gt;&gt; Ken Young, a man who seems to know quite a bit

What pace do you think the nobles that Harrison

typically kept?

It is perhaps worth noting that posthorses came
with a postboy, who added to the expense, and
who also would have served as insurance that
the men hiring the horses kept to the approved
route.

Of course they could have rented riding horses in
London for the entire trip, but there is no reason
to suppose that a riding horse is any more durable
than a cart horse. In short, whether they went by
carriage or horseback, they probably didn't average

Leisurely. Travelling about as fast as those

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you vastly underestimate the productivity of land

&gt;&gt; It would be interesting to know how much of

&gt;&gt; the English diet seem to have been meat, bread,
&gt;&gt; beer, cheese, and butter. Personally, I'd be
&gt;&gt; pretty surprised if the Londoners were able to produce
&gt;&gt; significantly more of any of the staples per acre than
&gt;&gt; could the average rural farmer.

&gt; Of course they could -- on a 'per acre' basis.
&gt; Ask any allotment holder. (Perhaps 'allotments'
&gt; are unknown in the US. But there is an ancient

According to everything I've read, the allotment
movement started in the 19th century. You may

'Borsetshire' not far from Stratford-upon-Avon.
All serious students of Shakespeare should be

American. Many of the ancient traditions and
attitudes of the English live on in such places

You exaggerate, as ever. Wagons certainly went

&quot;Elizabeth often used her private roads out of London: the King's Road

Court, the road from Lambeth Ferry, along the south bank to Greenwich
and Eltham, and Theobald's Road, leading north to (among other places)
Cecil's great palace . .&quot; (Paul Johnson, *Elizabeth&quot;, page 76)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Burghley's coaches would have been a regular

Tewkesbury Events Chronology

A Chronology of some aspects of Tewkesbury's past

(includes)

1557 The Avon still in use as the main water supply for drinking

1584 9 boats recorded in the Tewkesbury port books, ranging from 10 to
20 tons burthen carrying various cargoes including grain, malt
methglin and hides.

1636 The River Avon is made navigable

If you are interested in the history of the area, you will find the
local studies collections in the County libraries particularly
interesting.

The River Avon

The Warwick Avon meets the River Severn at Tewkesbury in the meadows
to the west of the town. The confluence is complicated in that the
Avon splits into two as it reaches the town, the Old Avon passing over
a weir into Stanchard Pit, and passing the site of the old town quay
where Healings Mill now stands before reaching the Severn.

The Mill Avon, a canal constructed by the C12th to serve the Abbey
Mills at the south of the town, and navigable as far as these mills,
served as an access by water to the commercial and industrial premises
that formerly lined the river's edge. The Mill Avon Continues to join
the course of the River Swilgate which runs along the foot of Holme
Hill to meet the Severn at Lower Lode. The Lower Avon Navigation Trust
is the navigation authority for the lower Avon as far as Evesham.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me get this straight. You don't think the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; roads in the Midlands were capable of taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 by 8 foot carts but you see the roads
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the South-East as being capable of taking

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. Those wagons may not have left London.

&gt;&gt; Ok. You think it's *possible* that the roads in
&gt;&gt; the South-East were capable of taking 11 by 15
&gt;&gt; foot wagons.

&gt; We know pageant wagons existed. Presumably
&gt; only theatre companies owned them,

"/>

My understanding is that 16th century Mystery Plays
were sponsored by the guilds, the pageant wagons
were built by guild craftsmen and the performers
were almost always members of the guild.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and also
&gt; presumably they had a regular and predictable
&gt; use.

"/>

As far as I know, they were employed during the
production of the Mystery Play cycles and
at no other times. (ie. During the feast
of Corpus Christi.) That is indeed both
predictable and regular, but I don't think
that &quot;once a year&quot; is the sort of predictability
and regularity you were shooting for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They would hardly have often been taken
&gt; on routes where the return journey was likely to
&gt; difficult.

"/>

I doubt they were ordinarily taken out of the
towns and cities where they were made.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That pretty much confines them to
&gt; places not too far from home (mostly London?).

"/>

There's a pretty good discussion of where they
were performed at:

To the best of our knowledge, the Corpus Christi
cycle was strictly an urban phenomenon, although
by no means all towns engaged in this activity ?
it appears to have been only a few of the larger,
more prosperous towns, particularly those in the
northern half of England. Samples of the plays
performed have survived for York, Chester,
Wakefield, Coventry, Newcastle and Norwich, while
there is evidence (or suspicion) that Beverley,
Ipswich, Kendal, Leicester, Lincoln, Bristol and
Worcester, and perhaps Lancaster, Louth, Preston,
Canterbury and London also hosted similar
performances. Plays that may or may not have a
Corpus Christi association, written largely in
Cornish Celtic, with the surviving copy dating
from the late fourteenth century, are associated
with the town of Penryn. For the gilds,
production and presentation of the plays gave an
opportunity for conspicuous display of
socio-economic status; there is some evidence of
competition between gilds to present visually
impressive performances, sometimes leading to
excess.

Note the &quot;perhaps&quot; for London. There were performances
of religious plays in London, but it is not known
that they were part of a Mystery Play cycle. (I
believe the London guild records from the time are
fairly extensive, so in this case, absence of evidence
would appear to be evidence of absence.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And you think it is impossible that
&gt;&gt; there was any cart traffic on the 19 or so miles
&gt;&gt; of road between Stratford and Coventry. Right?

&gt; No. I did not say that. But I think we can
&gt; assume that a touring company would prefer
&gt; a circular tour, meaning that all roads would
&gt; be new (that year) to them and a cart could
&gt; readily get stuck at an unexpected location --

"/>

I think the worst spots tended to be pretty well
known.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; or become very difficult to move, and have
&gt; to be left behind.

"/>

To get through a truly difficult spot, I suppose
they might have to hire some plowhorses, however,
if necessary, the men of the company could unload
the cart, hand carry the load past the slough, and
then help drag the empty cart through it. I do
suppose that they probably would not want to do
it often. The average carrier driving a wagon
wouldn't have been travelling with 10 or so pairs
of hands, so I think it's fairly reasonable to
suppose that there were roads players might
attempt with their wagon, that a carrier wouldn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, unless they knew in
&gt; advance that all their planned roads were in
&gt; good order, they'd probably try to avoid using
&gt; carts. It's unlikely IMO that they could often
&gt; rely on the roads in and out of Stratford.

"/>

If nothing else, they seem to have tended to tour
in the summer months, the time when the roads tended
to be at their best.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Indeed. One wonders why they might ever
&gt;&gt; think a pageant wagon a worthwhile purchase.

&gt; Presumably it's a moveable stage -- for a
&gt; site or sites used at frequent intervals.

"/>

To be sure, if the professional acting companies
were performing the same little playlet multiple times
in one day in multiple locations, they might have
wanted something like a pageant wagon, however, I
don't think it is known that any Elizabethan
professional acting company ever did such a thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; [..]

&gt;&gt; Of course they could have rented riding horses in
&gt;&gt; London for the entire trip,

&gt; We know that they did not rent riding horses out
&gt; of London -- he tells us that they left by coach,

"/>

I don't see the problem. If you are willing to
imagine that they took post horses without
mentioning them, it seems to me that you could
just as easily imagine that he failed to mention
the servant that trailed along behind the coach
with a string of hired horses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; but there is no reason
&gt;&gt; to suppose that a riding horse is any more durable
&gt;&gt; than a cart horse.

&gt; The system of 'posting' seems to have been
&gt; well established. Under that, a lamed horse
&gt; is only a minor problem

"/>

J Crofts in _Packhorse, Waggon, and Post_
wrote that in Elizabeth's time, a private
post rider had to pay 3d per mile. (Those
with official warrants paid considerably less.)

I can't say that I know how often horses
went lame or for that matter, how long it
usually took them to recover, but the
price differential between post horses
and hired horses was so large, it looks
to me like most people, unless they were
in a considerable hurry, would probably
find the risk acceptable. If not, then
a group like Hentzner's could easily hire
a spare horse or two and still come out
ahead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In short, whether they went by
&gt;&gt; carriage or horseback, they probably didn't average
&gt;&gt; much more than 20 miles per day.

&gt; That seems to me a very slow rate to cross
&gt; uninteresting countryside.

countryside interesting enough to go on walking
tours.

Yes, I think so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was probably the most common method
&gt;&gt;&gt; of personal transport, with horses used to
&gt;&gt;&gt; carry loads.

&gt;&gt; In 1675, Sir Robert Southwell reported to the
&gt;&gt; Royal Society that 60 percent of England's land
&gt;&gt; trade was packhorse. I'm guessing that most
&gt;&gt; of the rest was carried on wagons.

&gt; If that was 'inland trade' then plenty would

&gt; codes of behaviour.

And that's enough to let you predict that a late
16th century German lawyer writing a travel book,
for the purposes of exaggerating his status, would
leave out the mention of post horses(probably the
most expensive method of long distance travel
anywhere in Europe) in the hopes that his readers

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Orthodoxy has Shakspere going back and adapting or revising old plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because they have great chronological difficulties.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you know what their motives were?

&gt;&gt; It's pretty self-evident, isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What is so hard about
&gt;&gt;&gt; assuming they have Shakespeare adapting and/or revising old plays
&gt;&gt;&gt; because (1) that is what playwrights then did (and still do, albeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; more subtly), and (2) because that would explain how he learned his
&gt;&gt;&gt; craft?

&gt;&gt; In my experience, adapters and editors and hired guns are those who

&gt;&gt; show 'em what he's got and, so, brings everything to the table. He's
&gt;&gt; not going to rehash some old crap if he's out to impress his
&gt;&gt; employers.

&gt; Your experience doesn't count for much, Toby, but I'm not going to
&gt; argue about that. You're ignoring, with your argument, that
&gt; Shakespeare was an actor. It is easy for the sane to imagine him, as
&gt; an actor, touching up some dialogue here and there, then being asked
&gt; to fix a scene or two, for his company--then doctoring an entire

Jonson said Shakspere had a gift for running off at the mouth, but I
don't know if this &quot;talent&quot; ever parlayed itself into any success at
ad-libbing on stage. In fact, Jonson seemed to think that Shakspere

&gt; Jonson said Shakspere had a gift for running off at the mouth, but I
&gt; don't know if this &quot;talent&quot; ever parlayed itself into any success at
&gt; ad-libbing on stage. In fact, Jonson seemed to think that Shakspere
&gt; was especially prone to screwing up his lines (e.g., the Caesar
&gt; quote). Is that a fair assessment? (I think I hear the ghosts of a

Right. Jonson was speaking of Shakespeare as a playwright, as he did
in the First Folio.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In your Shakspere-as-Shakespeare scenario, surely the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; period of his playwriting apprenticeship would have come much earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 1592, so where's that stuff?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Henry VI trilogy, Comedy of Errors, probably Titus, possibly Two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gentlemen, maybe even a crude version of Hamlet. I think Loves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Labours Lost. No doubt revisions of plays others now get credit for,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and plays of his own that were so bad he junked them. Etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I see. Hamlet HAS to be in a &quot;crude&quot; form because you know how
&gt;&gt;&gt; laughable it is to suppose that a guy in his mid-20s was writing such
&gt;&gt;&gt; a PHILOSOPHICALLY and PSYCHOLOGICALLY sophisticated play ---and at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same time he was knocking out LLL and Titus?! Have you ever actually
&gt;&gt;&gt; THOUGHT about how fucked up your view of the Chronology actually is?

&gt;&gt; I've thought about my chronology a bit. It's not much different from
&gt;&gt; most others' chronologies. It has his poorer plays early, his more
&gt;&gt; sophisticated plays later. It makes sense to me and is backed by ALL
&gt;&gt; the hard evidence.

&gt; Gosh. And so conveniently!

"/>

Not really. I've argued with the Trust that more hard evidence should
be manufactured but they don't want to risk it now that you're on the
playing field.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For what company did he write?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whatever one he was an actor in at the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Strike as non-responsive.

&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

"/>

I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
usually start acting before they're thirty. Ooops, I just remembered
Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
before 1592. Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Probably Lord Strange's. What difference does it
&gt;&gt; make?

&gt; The difference it makes is that there is no record of any such
&gt; involvement. Why ISN'T there?

"/>

Because Oxford's followers wanted to make it seem like he wasn't an
actor and destroyed the evidence? Or, and I admit this is a long
shot, because very few records listing the actors in various companies
have survived?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's near-certain he was acting in SOME company. Hence, he
&gt;&gt; would have done his first play-writing for that company. Unless he
&gt;&gt; wrote a play on his own and went around trying to sell more than one
&gt;&gt; company on it.

&gt; It all sounds so reasonable. So, why isn't there any evidence for any
&gt; of it?

"/>

There's Greenes Groatsworth. There's also the fact that he was a
recorded actor which means he must have started acting at some point.
He was also a playwright with a published play by 1594, and it makes
much more sense that he started as an actor and became a playwright
than the reverse. To the sane.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have Shakspere walking out of a long &quot;lost period&quot; and into the H6
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays, TA, CoE, and both long poems (if not other plays) inside of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three years. That's a lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I don't. I have him writing the plays you mention from the late
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 80s through 1592.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For whom? You don't have any evidence of that, do you?

"/>

No real evidence, no. So what? It's understood that all chronologies
of necessity must be guesswork.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There is evidence of the Henry plays being performed in the late
&gt;&gt; eighties. We don't know when any of the plays was first performed,
&gt;&gt; but there's no reason to suppose they could not have been performed by
&gt;&gt; 1589 or so--which means they would have been written early, perhaps
&gt;&gt; even some years earlier.

&gt; So Shakspere is in his early 20s and decides to write a trilogy on
&gt; Henry VI. As well as a bloodbath and a couple of clumsy comedies.

"/>

You and Crowley certainly love to misdescribe others' thoughts in the
poorest possible light. A Comedy of Errors was not clumsy. I
wouldn't call Loves Labours Lost clumsy, either. It was defective in
other ways. Anyway, I can readily imagine him trying his had at
several different kinds of plays between the ages of sixteen and
twenty-eight, sure. I find it hard to believe he wrote the Henry VI
trilogy for enjoyment, as he may have written his comedies. I think
he was either commissioned to write it, or wrote it thinking he could
sell it to some company. The same, probably, with Titus--unless it
resulted from an adolesecent bloodthirsty phase.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, and one of the greatest tragedies in the English language.

"/>

Try to be honest, wack. I never said that. I said he may have
written a VERSION of Hamlet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's a lot of work for an unschooled autodidact.

"/>

Actually, unschooled autodidacts are usually more productive than
their betters--because, I guess, they have so much to prove. But I
can see these plays taking years to write. I can also see them all
being written in a year. LLL is very self-indulgent and
undisciplined. He could have written it in two weeks. Once he got
going on the Henry VI trilogy, with his source nearby, he could have
gotten it done in two months. Buoyed by the success of that, he could
have gushed out Titus in two weeks. Comedy of errors needn't have
taken more than a month. Remember, he would have been young, and
possibly desperate.
Double the lengths of time for each play, and he still needs only
eight months.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All we can be pretty definite about is that
&gt;&gt; Lucrece was written in 1593 or 1594, Venus and Adonis a year earlier,
&gt;&gt; and Henry VI, part 1, before 1592, when it was referred to by Greene.

&gt; No one knows when the two long poems were written; just when they were
&gt; published.

"/>

There's strong evidence for when Venus and Adonis was written, and we
know beyond reasonable doubt that Lucrece was written around the time
Venus &amp; Adonis was published because he personally, in effect, says it
was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the H6 adaptation would not have taken him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long, nor the Comedy of Errors, based as it is on someone else's play.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I see that you have taken it for granted that the H6 plays were
&gt;&gt;&gt; already around and just waiting for his magic touch.

&gt;&gt; No, wack, what was around was Edward Hall's book that was
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's chief source. Plays could have been around, too--we
&gt;&gt; don't know.

&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any real evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; of that? As for CoE, however much it's based on Plautus, it's still
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to have to be written in English and with a few more bells and
&gt;&gt;&gt; whistles, besides. But, hey, what can a budding genius NOT accomplish?

&gt;&gt; Especially if he's been working on it since first being exposed to it
&gt;&gt; at the age of 13 or so in school.

&gt; Who says Stratfordians have no imagination?

"/>

Do you really think that far-fetched? Did you not know that many
writers start writing things in school?

There are very few records of the names of *any* actors before
1592, except for the sharers in a few major companies such
as the Queen's Men and Worcester's Men. Over the entire
life of Strange's Men, we only know the names of seven
members of the company for sure -- six from a 1593 touring
patent, and one from a record of a 1591 court payment.
There is absolutely no reason to expect a record of
Shakespeare in the company, given that he presumably
would have been a hired man during that time. Or, if he
did become a sharer with Strange's Men, it's not too
surprising that he wasn't one of the six men named in
the 1593 touring patent, since he was presumably working
on Lucrece during that time.

Look at it this way. The first certain record of Shakespeare
as an actor with a specific company is the 1595 court payment
which shows him as a prominent member of the Lord Chamberlain's
Men. That same record is also the first certain record of
Richard Burbage as an actor, at a time when Burbage was 26 years
old. Why ISN'T there any record of Burbage's acting career
before that time? Hmmmmm??? He suddenly shows up as one
of the leading members of the top acting company in London,
and he's soon vying with Edward Alleyn for the title of
best actor in England, and there's no record of him acting
before 1595? You can't be serious! There must be some
conspiracy at work here. Or, hey, it could just be that
there are very few records of specific actors before that time.

I'll buy that Shakspere would have been in Strange's Men since (if I

I think Richard Burbage gets points for being his father's son on this

Please. It's a family affair. Richard Burbage probably never had a

I don't know about all this, Paul. It's passing crafty, to be sure,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There are very few records of the names of *any* actors before

See? Dave's not saying that such records don't exist, he's just saying
that VERY few of them predate 1592, which is what you should expect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Over the entire
&gt;&gt; life of Strange's Men, we only know the names of seven
&gt;&gt; members of the company for sure -- six from a 1593 touring
&gt;&gt; patent, and one from a record of a 1591 court payment.

"/>

There's even records from AROUND that time for the company most likely
to have been Shakspere's, but they are not exactly the type we might
expect to bear Shakspere's name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There is absolutely no reason to expect a record of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare in the company, given that he presumably
&gt;&gt; would have been a hired man during that time.

Now, here, I would quibble with Dave's language. It is a bit extreme
to invoke the term absolutely in the main clause when the conditional
clause is predicated upon a presumption only. But it IS a cold blast
of air, is it not? The qualification just slinks on by as we enjoy the
certainty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Or, if he
&gt;&gt; did become a sharer with Strange's Men, it's not too
&gt;&gt; surprising that he wasn't one of the six men named in
&gt;&gt; the 1593 touring patent, since he was presumably working
&gt;&gt; on Lucrece during that time.

"/>

Crowley, you WILL not find a seam in that one. We are, in fact, free
to be surprised to a limited degree at NOT finding Shakspere's name on
the plague-season touring patent. Have you enjoyed that license? We
have never not been told what occupied Shakspere in those pestilent
times and here it is again, authoritative and Marchette Chutish in its
explicativity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Look at it this way. The first certain record of Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; as an actor with a specific company is the 1595 court payment
&gt;&gt; which shows him as a prominent member of the Lord Chamberlain's
&gt;&gt; Men.

"/>

Are you saying that the GGW has an escape hatch? Could something else

Chettle could've been clearer, I think. And Shake-spear remained a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Right. Jonson was speaking of Shakespeare as a playwright, as he did
&gt;&gt; in the First Folio.
&gt; Paid endorsement.

"/>

That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't
necessarily what it was. For instance, he may have written the poem
because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
accepted or not accepted money for it.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt; before 1592.

&gt; At least nominally.

"/>

No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
with the London theatre of his time. If he called Shakespeare an
actor, Shakespeare was almost certainly an actor. (He didn't insult
him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
an actor, I would think.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

"/>

I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.
But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
playwrights fear they'll lose their markets. And a pretender doesn't
write actual quoted lines from plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably Lord Strange's. What difference does it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The difference it makes is that there is no record of any such
&gt;&gt;&gt; involvement. Why ISN'T there?

&gt;&gt; Because Oxford's followers wanted to make it seem like he wasn't an
&gt;&gt; actor and destroyed the evidence? Or, and I admit this is a long
&gt;&gt; shot, because very few records listing the actors in various companies
&gt;&gt; have survived?

&gt; That's a comfy chair.

"/>

I said it was a long shot. But I think there's a record that has been
PROVED to have been lost over the years relating to one of my English
ancestors, so it CAN happen that records can be lost.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's near-certain he was acting in SOME company. Hence, he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have done his first play-writing for that company. Unless he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote a play on his own and went around trying to sell more than one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It all sounds so reasonable. So, why isn't there any evidence for any
&gt;&gt;&gt; of it?

&gt;&gt; There's Greenes Groatsworth.

&gt; You're right. I stand corrected. Despite the GGW's questionable
&gt; authorship and the absolute rejection made of it by writers of the
&gt; time and Chettle's confused apology made in its stead afterward, even
&gt; I must consider it a reference to Shakspere the actor, although I'm
&gt; not sure how.

"/>

By attending to what its words mean? &quot;One of them,&quot; for instance,
following a sentence about actors?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There's also the fact that he was a
&gt;&gt; recorded actor which means he must have started acting at some point.
&gt;&gt; He was also a playwright with a published play by 1594, and it makes
&gt;&gt; much more sense that he started as an actor and became a playwright
&gt;&gt; than the reverse. To the sane.

&gt; You'll learn.

That's almost as doubtful as your learning to respond to arguments

Why am I not surprised that Toby claims records cannot be lost over
time?

I'm writing a book on a 20th century Pennsylvania chessplayer, Sydney
Sharp, and I've found the following records missing, among many
others:

All membership, financial, and other records for the Franklin Chess
Club and the Mercantile Library Chess Club. The records, dating to the
Franklin's founding in 1885, were thrown in the trash a few years
after the Franklin and Mercantile merged in 1955.

Chess columns in the Philadelphia Public Ledger from 1914-early 1916.
It seems the column was in a Sunday magazine suppliment, and the
sunday magazine never made it to microfilm. Ditto the chess column of
the Pittsburgh Sun. Some newspapers, such as the Lansdale Republican,
haven't survived at all.

Pennsylvania State Chess Association records. The organization that
ran state championships from 1897-1946 dissolved, and the records were
lost. The successor organization, the Pennsylvania State Chess
Federation, has no records of its founding, aside from a notice
published in the Chess Correspondent. When I wrote an account of the
1943 PSCF Championship tournament, I had to largely rely on the
memories of the two survivors of the event and brief accounts in
magazines.

All of this was 20th century, Toby. Why do you hold the 16th century
to a higher standard? Or am I being duped by the Chess Trust, who is
obviously hiding the records to ensure I do not discover the truth
about &quot;Sydney Sharp&quot; (obviously a pseudonym).

Lost records are not the problem. The problem is that the Stratford
man was never in the literary context of the day, and only came to
notice 7 years after he was dead. Your man Sydney Sharp was probably
known, and you can probably find recollections of him, even a snatch
of speech, others who played with him over the board, etc. etc.
Nothing of that for the Stratford man. He was a ghost, so far as we
might want to fit him into the lit. context of London, he's got no

I have a question of all at HLAS who knowz the language. While I
agree that Kennedy is a lying scumbag, I believe he is only a minor
lying scumbag, not a major scumbag, because he is saying that because
no one in Shakespeare's lifetime who referred to Shakespeare the poet,
did so in a way that directly identified Shakespeare the poet as
Shakespeare of Stratford, he can say no one referred to Shakespeare
the poet as Shakespeare of Stratford during the latter's lifetime.
But he can't know that the many people who referred to Shakespeare the
poet were not referring to Shakespeare of Stratford, so he is
half-lying, or what? Is there any word that describes the act of
saying something is true when you know only that it MAY be true?
(Forget that we know that it IS true since posthumous evidence that
establishes Shakespeare of Stratford as Shakespeare the poet beyond
reasonable doubt retroactively makes earlier references to Shakespeare
the poet references to Shakespeare of Stratford. Kennedy isn't bright
enough to understand that.)

Anyway, my question, better phrased, is this: while we know that if
Mr. K. knows A is true but says it's false, he is a liar, what do we
call him if he knows he lacks sufficient evidence to tell whether A is
true or not, but says it's false?

What the hell is all this? Is this poster aware of the venue he is intruding upon?
What a vainglorious self-serving hack he must be to promote
his unwritten unrelated &quot;book&quot; right here on our Shakespeare forum!
That he misperceives the Shakespearean era to make some comparison of his
own dumb uninvolved life is an insult! Nothing in his me-me-me-me-me post
has any bearing on our devoted subject matter! He ought go write
the little chess book on his own time and just leave HLAS
out of it! How dare he stretch his own &quot;lack of records&quot; into having
any linkage at all to our forum? And then name a thread about his so-called
chess research? What in the hell does that have to do with Shakespeare?
He is obviously pretending that edifying himself as some book writer
makes up for his lack of background and interest in our devoted subject
matter. Why us? Why are we his selected target? Why can't he tell chess
people or gameplayers or petlovers? Why does he pollute a Shakespeare
newsgroup?

This obnoxious self-glorification of his is a great example of
why reading his input--albeit secondhand through the post of
another--is a waste of time. Lucky he's the only one here selfish
enough to so disregard our topic and talk about himself--because this
place would fall apart if more people showed such disregard. We're
not a chatroom to promote outside interests. Please show respect for
our topic--don't spam us about your would-be achievements or your
personal doings in unrelated fields. No respected regular has ever tried
to pretend that our mutual Shakespeare studies are an example of
some remote self interest. Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone needs
to respect our newsgroup and promote his chess work where it would
be appropriate. I was disappointed to see his self-serving tripe cluttering HLAS.
He needs to talk about his chess research where it makes any sense and we need
to pursue our Shakespeare interests. That's why we have our newsgroup,
so I expect him to refrain from spamming us about his oh-so-exciting interests.

I don't access this gadfly so I won't be aware as he tries to justify his vanity
at our expense. I just need him aware that it does not serve our objectives
to twist our themes into into his own spams; and then, to further implore him
to never repeat such self serving behavior here. Think Shakespeare. Read Shakespeare.
When in doubt that your contribution is relative to Shakespeare--don't post it.
Never pretend that your self-serving anecdotes further our cause.

(Lorenzo, don't suggest I'm bullying or assuming authority--I work
only for the common good and am chagrined by the utter lack of
decorum displayed by gadflies. It is difficult and sad to seek order
but I sacrifice when I must and I tell the bums to move on to where
they will be more comfortable.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right. Jonson was speaking of Shakespeare as a playwright, as he did
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the First Folio.

&gt;&gt; Paid endorsement.

&gt; That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't
&gt; necessarily what it was. For instance, he may have written the poem
&gt; because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
&gt; accepted or not accepted money for it.)

At or about the same time as the publication of the FF, Ben Jonson was
a pensioner by the grace of William Herbert (Mr. W.H., anyone?), one
of two incomparable and dedicated bretheren. Regardless of your

doesn't that factoid give you any pause at all in assessing Jonson's
motivations as the FF's overseer?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt;&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1592.

&gt;&gt; At least nominally.

&gt; No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
&gt; with the London theatre of his time.

Does it make any difference if Greene was NOT the author and if the
pamphlet from which that allusion comes was blasted at the time as a
big pack of lies?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If he called Shakespeare an

As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her
book?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt;&gt; shot, because very few records listing the actors in various companies
&gt;&gt;&gt; have survived?

&gt;&gt; That's a comfy chair.

&gt; I said it was a long shot. But I think there's a record that has been

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It all sounds so reasonable. So, why isn't there any evidence for any

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's Greenes Groatsworth.

&gt;&gt; You're right. I stand corrected. Despite the GGW's questionable
&gt;&gt; authorship and the absolute rejection made of it by writers of the
&gt;&gt; time and Chettle's confused apology made in its stead afterward, even
&gt;&gt; I must consider it a reference to Shakspere the actor, although I'm
&gt;&gt; not sure how.

Some people think it's a Ned Alleyn reference, Bob.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's also the fact that he was a

&gt;&gt;&gt; much more sense that he started as an actor and became a playwright
&gt;&gt;&gt; than the reverse. To the sane.

Can you otherwise explain your statement: &quot;The difference it makes is
that there is no record of any such involvement. Why ISN'T there?&quot;

The answer is that Shakespeareans accept that the preservation of
records and documentation is haphazard at best. However,
antiShakespeareans have the double-standard of requiring more and more
documentation to support Shakespeare's authorship, and yet accepting
any excuse and conjecture for the lack of documentation supporting an
alternate authorship. Sorry Toby, but at the end of the day we have
the monument, the Folio, the title pages, Jonson, Greene, etc, - in
short, all the surviving records, and you have squat.

Richard Kennedy has acknowledged in the past (although I'm sure he
won't remember it) that there is evidence that Shakespeare of
Stratford was the actor William Shakespeare who was a member of the
King's Men.

If Shakespeare was a member of the King's Men, the company that put on
the plays of William Shakespeare, and if the plays were credited to
William Shakespeare, it should be clear to anyone that William
Shakespeare of Stratford was being credited as the author of the
plays.

Many anti-Strats argue that Shakespeare of Stratford was merely a
front for the real author. However, if you acknowledge Shakespeare of
Stratford was the actor, then you have to acknowledge Shakespeare of
Stratford was credited as the author in his lifetime.

Even Price and Petzold acknowledge this, but it's beyond Richard
Kennedy.

&gt; I have a question of all at HLAS who knowz the language. While I

&gt; lying scumbag, not a major scumbag, because he is saying that because
&gt; no one in Shakespeare's lifetime who referred to Shakespeare the poet,
&gt; did so in a way that directly identified Shakespeare the poet as
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford, he can say no one referred to Shakespeare
&gt; the poet as Shakespeare of Stratford during the latter's lifetime.
&gt; But he can't know that the many people who referred to Shakespeare the
&gt; poet were not referring to Shakespeare of Stratford, so he is
&gt; half-lying, or what? Is there any word that describes the act of
&gt; saying something is true when you know only that it MAY be true?
&gt; (Forget that we know that it IS true since posthumous evidence that

Come on, Greg--he used his experience in tracing records for use in
his book to show how foolish Toby is in his assumption that
biographical records are easily found. Aside from that, you're
sounding a little like Dave More when he requires people posting to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right. Jonson was speaking of Shakespeare as a playwright, as he did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the First Folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Paid endorsement.

&gt;&gt; That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't
&gt;&gt; necessarily what it was. For instance, he may have written the poem
&gt;&gt; because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
&gt;&gt; accepted or not accepted money for it.)

&gt; At or about the same time as the publication of the FF, Ben Jonson was
&gt; a pensioner by the grace of William Herbert (Mr. W.H., anyone?), one
&gt; of two incomparable and dedicated bretheren. Regardless of your
&gt; opinion of the mad hatters who besiege you with their otherness,
&gt; doesn't that factoid give you any pause at all in assessing Jonson's
&gt; motivations as the FF's overseer?

"/>

Interesting: you give me what seems to be an actual fact for once--but
call it a &quot;factoid!&quot; Then you throw me a factoid as if it were a
fact: Jonson's being the First Folio's overseer. He contributed to
poems to it, Toby. Heminges and Condell said THEY oversaw it. Unless
you can find hard evidence, or even sensible soft evidence, that
Jonson oversaw it, I will have to accept their word. (How many other
books by others did Jonson over see, by the way?)

That Jonson was a pensioner of a lord, not a mister, with the initials
W.H., tells me that Herbert was so true a lover of the arts that he
patronized both Shakespeare (or his company) and Jonson. Otherwise,
so what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1592.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At least nominally.

&gt;&gt; No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
&gt;&gt; with the London theatre of his time.

&gt; Does it make any difference if Greene was NOT the author and if the
&gt; pamphlet from which that allusion comes was blasted at the time as a
&gt; big pack of lies?

"/>

A little. But Chettle would then probably have been the author, and
he would have been almost as knowledgeable about the literary scene as
Greene. He would have no reason to lie, either. The fact that Nashe
condemned the Groatsworth as lies means little since he did that after
being accused of having written it, so could be expected to have
wanted to distance himself as far as possible from it. It is even
possible that he hadn't even read it before pronouncing it a lying
pamphlet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If he called Shakespeare an
&gt;&gt; actor, Shakespeare was almost certainly an actor.

&gt; As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
&gt; ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

"/>

No, but it's clear enough.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; (He didn't insult
&gt;&gt; him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
&gt;&gt; blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
&gt;&gt; an actor, I would think.)

&gt; Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her
&gt; book?

"/>

No. I made up all the things I quoted from it in the many posts to
HLAS on it that I made. That my comment just before yours is an
obvious reference to her insane notion that Shakespeare was a
play-broker is just a coincidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.

&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt; But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
&gt;&gt; playwrights fear they'll lose their markets.

&gt; Unless those plays he supplies are a cut above any pretense. [Greene]
&gt; or Chettle or whoever it was was saying that this cat's full of crap
&gt; coming around here with his slick blank verse and aren't we all a
&gt; little worried about who (or what) he is? Watch out: he's playing with
&gt; a marked deck and is a JACK of all trades. He didn't pay his dues and
&gt; he didn't go to school with any of us. Where does he get off?
&gt;&gt; And a pretender doesn't
&gt;&gt; write actual quoted lines from plays.

&gt; Is that a law or something or do I just not understand your point?

"/>

Read my essay on this. I don't feel like going through it again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably Lord Strange's. What difference does it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The difference it makes is that there is no record of any such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involvement. Why ISN'T there?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because Oxford's followers wanted to make it seem like he wasn't an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor and destroyed the evidence? Or, and I admit this is a long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shot, because very few records listing the actors in various companies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have survived?

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a comfy chair.

&gt;&gt; I said it was a long shot. But I think there's a record that has been
&gt;&gt; PROVED to have been lost over the years relating to one of my English
&gt;&gt; ancestors, so it CAN happen that records can be lost.

&gt; Oh, okay. Now I see where Brennen scraped off that little morsel: Yes.
&gt; Yes, I know records can be lost.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's near-certain he was acting in SOME company. Hence, he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have done his first play-writing for that company. Unless he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote a play on his own and went around trying to sell more than one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It all sounds so reasonable. So, why isn't there any evidence for any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's Greenes Groatsworth.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right. I stand corrected. Despite the GGW's questionable
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship and the absolute rejection made of it by writers of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time and Chettle's confused apology made in its stead afterward, even
&gt;&gt;&gt; I must consider it a reference to Shakspere the actor, although I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; not sure how.

&gt;&gt; By attending to what its words mean? &quot;One of them,&quot; for instance,
&gt;&gt; following a sentence about actors?

&gt; Some people think it's a Ned Alleyn reference, Bob.

"/>

Read my essay. It isn't Ned Alleyn.

of the finesse of a chess strategist and all of the bad temperament of
an outright hothead. I've never seen a chess player win by trashtalking.
namecalling, and losing focus. His MO on usenet is to antagonize people.

Thank you, dave is a Fave but I was only thinking of HLAS
posters confining their material to the devoted subject without the
self-promotion, self-aggrandizement, and outright clutter.

There IS much to say on loss of records but legit contributors would likely
support the known mutual interest here, not go blabbing some blue
streak about themselves and their erstwhile importance to themselves.
Blatant self-aggrandizement is quite obvious. (When the subject matter
mysteriously, uncontrollably turns to chess, for instance.)

Your own feuds are sacred jihads, I forgot.
This favorite thug of yours has a long bad habit of antagonizing
newsgroups. And a bad habit of blowing his own horn here.
He has castigated regulars without making any
sensible contributions of his own. Most flakes flake off, but he
is adamant that he will somehow hurt me with his childish
usenet antics. Very unbecoming of our pleasant little forum.

Ignore him? I keep him at arm's length and I never access
his selfish slop. (This one crept over another's contribution.)
I've never accessed chess sites. When his posts do appear via
third party, he's blabbing about himself instead of our topic.
But he WILL get the message and there WILL be less of
his chatroom mentality some day.

But, okay, Bob, I'll just ignore him when he pollutes the ng and
I'll let you read about his pet projects that relate to nothing.
His &quot;contribution&quot; regarding the loss of records is self-serving
platitudinal slop, exactly what he's known for, and don't pretend it
enlightened Toby. It was posted solely to make its own originator feel
important. Too bad it did nothing to further our ongoing interest
in the genuine loss of records.

Thanks for being such a snuggly St. Bernard at HLAS, but you
really can't save them all.

Back to King John where the women are getting all the lines.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right. Jonson was speaking of Shakespeare as a playwright, as he did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the First Folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paid endorsement.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily what it was. For instance, he may have written the poem
&gt;&gt;&gt; because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted or not accepted money for it.)

&gt;&gt; At or about the same time as the publication of the FF, Ben Jonson was
&gt;&gt; a pensioner by the grace of William Herbert (Mr. W.H., anyone?), one
&gt;&gt; of two incomparable and dedicated bretheren. Regardless of your
&gt;&gt; opinion of the mad hatters who besiege you with their otherness,
&gt;&gt; doesn't that factoid give you any pause at all in assessing Jonson's

Since only initials are provided, it would seem that some kind of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1592.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least nominally.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the London theatre of his time.

&gt;&gt; Does it make any difference if Greene was NOT the author and if the
&gt;&gt; pamphlet from which that allusion comes was blasted at the time as a
&gt;&gt; big pack of lies?

&gt; A little. But Chettle would then probably have been the author, and
&gt; he would have been almost as knowledgeable about the literary scene as
&gt; Greene.

"/>

Possibly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He would have no reason to lie, either. The fact that Nashe

&gt; being accused of having written it, so could be expected to have
&gt; wanted to distance himself as far as possible from it. It is even
&gt; possible that he hadn't even read it before pronouncing it a lying
&gt; pamphlet.

"/>

My point is that the GGW is a very controversial little pamphlet and
was considered to be a bunch of crap IN ITS OWN TIME.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If he called Shakespeare an
&gt;&gt;&gt; actor, Shakespeare was almost certainly an actor.

&gt;&gt; As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

&gt; No, but it's clear enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (He didn't insult
&gt;&gt;&gt; him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
&gt;&gt;&gt; blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
&gt;&gt;&gt; an actor, I would think.)

&gt;&gt; Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her
&gt;&gt; book?

&gt; No. I made up all the things I quoted from it in the many posts to
&gt; HLAS on it that I made. That my comment just before yours is an
&gt; obvious reference to her insane notion that Shakespeare was a
&gt; play-broker is just a coincidence.

"/>

That's the spirit! See how much better a quip you can make when you
stop trying to be creative?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.

&gt;&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
&gt;&gt;&gt; playwrights fear they'll lose their markets.

&gt;&gt; Unless those plays he supplies are a cut above any pretense. [Greene]
&gt;&gt; or Chettle or whoever it was was saying that this cat's full of crap
&gt;&gt; coming around here with his slick blank verse and aren't we all a
&gt;&gt; little worried about who (or what) he is? Watch out: he's playing with
&gt;&gt; a marked deck and is a JACK of all trades. He didn't pay his dues and
&gt;&gt; he didn't go to school with any of us. Where does he get off?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And a pretender doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; write actual quoted lines from plays.

&gt;&gt; Is that a law or something or do I just not understand your point?

&gt; Read my essay on this. I don't feel like going through it again.

I started a reply to this, mistaking your tone --
and then had to scrap it.

Actually, your tone here is interesting -- the dry,
subtle, 'martini-like' American form of irony, which
is quite difficult to carry off, especially in forums
like this.

I think that I have annoyed you in the past by
implying that Americans lack a sense of irony.
Really all I am saying is that the form of humour is
quite different. Most Americans miss much of the
irony in Shakespeare (especially in the sonnets)
because they expect a level of 'seriousness' which
just is not present -- or is present in a form with
which they are not familiar. If anything, Shake-
speare's humour might be said to be too crude
for them. Like the puns, the bawdy or the
scatology, they can see little that is amusing in
such crudity.

However, I think that you would agree that there
is in your post here, a level of subtlety that would
be missed by many Americans. It is 'East Coast',
rather than 'Texan' or 'Californian'. Yes? No?

Paul.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are very few records of the names of *any* actors before
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1592, except for the sharers in a few major companies such
&gt;&gt;&gt; as the Queen's Men and Worcester's Men.

&gt; See? Dave's not saying that such records don't exist, he's just saying
&gt; that VERY few of them predate 1592, which is what you should expect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Over the entire
&gt;&gt;&gt; life of Strange's Men, we only know the names of seven
&gt;&gt;&gt; members of the company for sure -- six from a 1593 touring
&gt;&gt;&gt; patent, and one from a record of a 1591 court payment.

&gt; There's even records from AROUND that time for the company most likely
&gt; to have been Shakspere's, but they are not exactly the type we might
&gt; expect to bear Shakspere's name.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is absolutely no reason to expect a record of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare in the company, given that he presumably
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have been a hired man during that time.

&gt; Now, here, I would quibble with Dave's language. It is a bit extreme
&gt; to invoke the term absolutely in the main clause when the conditional
&gt; clause is predicated upon a presumption only. But it IS a cold blast
&gt; of air, is it not? The qualification just slinks on by as we enjoy the
&gt; certainty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or, if he
&gt;&gt;&gt; did become a sharer with Strange's Men, it's not too
&gt;&gt;&gt; surprising that he wasn't one of the six men named in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 1593 touring patent, since he was presumably working
&gt;&gt;&gt; on Lucrece during that time.

&gt; Crowley, you WILL not find a seam in that one. We are, in fact, free
&gt; to be surprised to a limited degree at NOT finding Shakspere's name on
&gt; the plague-season touring patent. Have you enjoyed that license? We
&gt; have never not been told what occupied Shakspere in those pestilent
&gt; times and here it is again, authoritative and Marchette Chutish in its
&gt; explicativity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at it this way. The first certain record of Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; as an actor with a specific company is the 1595 court payment
&gt;&gt;&gt; which shows him as a prominent member of the Lord Chamberlain's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Men.

&gt; Are you saying that the GGW has an escape hatch? Could something else
&gt; have been meant by that most over-analyzed of allusions? Oh, well.
&gt; Chettle could've been clearer, I think. And Shake-spear remained a
&gt; free lance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That same record is also the first certain record of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Richard Burbage as an actor, at a time when Burbage was 26 years
&gt;&gt;&gt; old. Why ISN'T there any record of Burbage's acting career
&gt;&gt;&gt; before that time? Hmmmmm???

&gt; James Burbage probably didn't believe in giving his boys too much
&gt; marquee space, as it were.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He suddenly shows up as one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the leading members of the top acting company in London,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and he's soon vying with Edward Alleyn for the title of
&gt;&gt;&gt; best actor in England, and there's no record of him acting
&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1595? You can't be serious!

&gt; But he's John Wilkes Burbage! With a family like his, he was gonna be
&gt; noteworthy no matter what.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There must be some
&gt;&gt;&gt; conspiracy at work here. Or, hey, it could just be that
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are very few records of specific actors before that time.

&gt; What, 1592? I was expecting that.

You can literally map Strat fear, Petzold, by the amount
of scholarship they invest in one area or another of the
Stratforidan lie.

There is relatively very little scholarship on the First Folio
and next to nothing on the front matter.

Try finding scholarship on Jonson's Eulogy, so called. Even
Jonsonians won't touch it.

&gt;&gt; so what?

"/>

The so-what, Grumman, is that the First Folio Dedication to
Herbert tells us that he was the Patron of the Shakespeare plays.
Not Southampton who was a lunatic Catholic extremist. The
plays are not Catholic. They repudiate Purgatory which was
the medieval Doctrine of Doctrines that made the Church rich
and powerful. I was just reading an article about the fact that
all the English charitable and educational institutions went broke
the minute Henry VIII split with Rome because Purgatory
was paying for all these quite wonderful Roman Catholic social
institutions. It was a horrible loss to the English people.

Southampton was so persistently radical Catholic that when
Southampton House was raided in 1606 over 200 seditious
Catholic books and pamphlets were burned in the street
out in front of his house. Southampton is Unanswered Question
Number One in all this. He got by on his beauty and charm
in an era that was rahther blatantly homeosekshul but
I think he caused a lot of harm along the way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since only initials are provided, it would seem that some kind of
&gt; semi-concealment was intended. Do you think calling W.H. &quot;Lord&quot; or

&gt; think the ratio of gentlemen to earls was about even?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1592.

"/>

Some scholars attribute that to Alleyn with whom
Greene was quarreling at the time. It could also be
Bacon who was Shake-speare at Gray's Inn.

Your problem, Grumman, is that &quot;worships&quot;--university
MAs in the rhetoric of rank--came 'round to straighten Greene
out on the qualities of their friend the author--university MA's
could not--by virtue of rank--defend a vagabond licensed
like a dog to his company patron.

Also, the qualities that Chettle describes are the same qualities
that describe Francis Bacon countless times in the reocord.

The London Hustler--who was clearly hustling for a living
in the same way that made the scoundrel Henslowe so
rich because we know the Hustler's sources of income--
is not describable in the terms Chettle uses. Exactly the
opposite. He was intensely disliked in Stratford--the locals
wanted to hang him from his doorway. He turned down the
proposition of Sturley and Quyney in their letter I posted
and sided with the hated Combes against the Stratford
Corporation. That gave him a little currency with his
betters but the townsfolk of Stratford despised him. He
was not a nice fellow, Grumman. Jonson was right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least nominally.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the London theatre of his time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it make any difference if Greene was NOT the author and if the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pamphlet from which that allusion comes was blasted at the time as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; big pack of lies?

&gt;&gt; A little. But Chettle would then probably have been the author, and
&gt;&gt; he would have been almost as knowledgeable about the literary scene as
&gt;&gt; Greene.

&gt; Possibly.

&gt;&gt; He would have no reason to lie, either. The fact that Nashe
&gt;&gt; condemned the Groatsworth as lies means little since he did that after
&gt;&gt; being accused of having written it, so could be expected to have
&gt;&gt; wanted to distance himself as far as possible from it. It is even
&gt;&gt; possible that he hadn't even read it before pronouncing it a lying
&gt;&gt; pamphlet.

"/>

The &quot;worships&quot; were not the only one straightening out the
rival playwrights. There are periods of dead silence coming
from an arena of witty and bitter playwrights and poets that
would otherwise be firing pamphlets and satires back and
forth at each other. Five years follow the death of Greene
and Marlowe in which there is not a peep. That's unnatural
silence.

The reason for this silence is the fact that Whitgift was
Lord Burghley's protege. Burghley made Whitgift the
Archbishop of Canterbury and a Privy Councillor because
Whitgift was censor and Burghley hated the theatre and
its huge power to change English consciousness. Burghley
was a closet Calvinist. They hated the theatres. Read
Calvin's Not A Republic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My point is that the GGW is a very controversial little pamphlet and
&gt; was considered to be a bunch of crap IN ITS OWN TIME.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If he called Shakespeare an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor, Shakespeare was almost certainly an actor.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

&gt;&gt; No, but it's clear enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (He didn't insult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an actor, I would think.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her
&gt;&gt;&gt; book?

&gt;&gt; No. I made up all the things I quoted from it in the many posts to
&gt;&gt; HLAS on it that I made. That my comment just before yours is an
&gt;&gt; obvious reference to her insane notion that Shakespeare was a
&gt;&gt; play-broker is just a coincidence.

&gt; That's the spirit! See how much better a quip you can make when you
&gt; stop trying to be creative?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playwrights fear they'll lose their markets.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless those plays he supplies are a cut above any pretense. [Greene]
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Chettle or whoever it was was saying that this cat's full of crap
&gt;&gt;&gt; coming around here with his slick blank verse and aren't we all a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little worried about who (or what) he is? Watch out: he's playing with
&gt;&gt;&gt; a marked deck and is a JACK of all trades. He didn't pay his dues and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't go to school with any of us. Where does he get off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And a pretender doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write actual quoted lines from plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that a law or something or do I just not understand your point?

&gt;&gt; Read my essay on this. I don't feel like going through it again.

&gt; There's a lot of that going around.

What lie?

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,
But antiquated and deserted lie,
As they were not of ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paid endorsement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted or not accepted money for it.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; At or about the same time as the publication of the FF, Ben Jonson was

No, wack. We consider the facts, and there is just one in this case:
their testimony that they oversaw the compilation of the First Folio.
(Unless you count the negative evidence, to wit: that no one of the
time said they did not oversee it.) You ignore this because it
doesn't fit your rigidniplex. It doesn't prove they oversaw the
compilation of the First Folio, and it is not insane to believe it
possible that they did not. It IS insane to dogmatically assert that
they did so.

I believe they did but don't consider it certain beyond reasonable
doubt.
Almost, though. Who would have known the plays of Shakespeare better
than they? Why would Jonson's helping them with their prefaces, or
even writing those prefaces, make him the First Folio's overseer?

Foster has explained the W.H. to my satisfaction. If it was bogus,

&gt;&gt; being accused of having written it, so could be expected to have

&gt;&gt; possible that he hadn't even read it before pronouncing it a lying

&gt; My point is that the GGW is a very controversial little pamphlet and

Hey, maybe that's why Shakespeare complained about it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If he called Shakespeare an

&gt;&gt;&gt; As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

&gt;&gt; No, but it's clear enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (He didn't insult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an actor, I would think.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her

&gt;&gt; No. I made up all the things I quoted from it in the many posts to
&gt;&gt; HLAS on it that I made. That my comment just before yours is an
&gt;&gt; obvious reference to her insane notion that Shakespeare was a
&gt;&gt; play-broker is just a coincidence.

&gt; That's the spirit! See how much better a quip you can make when you
&gt; stop trying to be creative?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playwrights fear they'll lose their markets.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless those plays he supplies are a cut above any pretense. [Greene]
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Chettle or whoever it was was saying that this cat's full of crap
&gt;&gt;&gt; coming around here with his slick blank verse and aren't we all a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little worried about who (or what) he is? Watch out: he's playing with
&gt;&gt;&gt; a marked deck and is a JACK of all trades. He didn't pay his dues and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't go to school with any of us. Where does he get off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And a pretender doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write actual quoted lines from plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that a law or something or do I just not understand your point?

&gt;&gt; Read my essay on this. I don't feel like going through it again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Thanks for demonstrating why your reasoning is so poor. THINK about
&gt;&gt; what you just wrote. Is it reasonable to suppose that Heminge and
&gt;&gt; Condell only authored one thing in their whole lives and it just
&gt;&gt; happened to be the prefatory words to the First Folio? That is to ask,
&gt;&gt; have you ever read anything else by either of these two? Why not? Are

&gt;&gt; Guess we just take 'em at dere word!

&gt; No, wack. We consider the facts, and there is just one in this case:
&gt; their testimony that they oversaw the compilation of the First Folio.

"/>

It is a fact that the testimony in the preface to the FF is attributed
to H &amp; C (by virtue of its being written in the 1st person plural),
but it is far from certain that they were, themselves, actually
responsible for it. Why are you unable to follow such a basic
interpretation? Are you unfamiliar with the concept of ghostwriting?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Unless you count the negative evidence, to wit: that no one of the
&gt; time said they did not oversee it.) You ignore this because it
&gt; doesn't fit your rigidniplex.

"/>

I'm simply speaking to likelihoods, wanker. Show me ONE piece of any
other thing either of them ever wrote and I will happily qualify my
assertion. Otherwise, I am free to believe in the greater likelihood
that a paid writer of Jonson's caliber would have been in a better
position to have done the deal than these two old actors who are not
known to have written anything else in their entire lives.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It doesn't prove they oversaw the

Whatever. Your prose makes my head hurt.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Do you have to wear a neckbrace when you write?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Is that the sole standard? Because, if it is, then it certainly didn't
prevent the FF from being filled with mistakes and poor editing. Hmm.
Come to think of it, maybe you're right. Maybe H &amp; C's amateur editing
IS in evidence everywhere in the FF. Of course, Jonson still might
have done the overseeing, but decided to work his soft sabotage in a
pique of passive-aggressive envy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would Jonson's helping them with their prefaces, or
&gt; even writing those prefaces, make him the First Folio's overseer?

"/>

I don't know. It's all madness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can find hard evidence, or even sensible soft evidence, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson oversaw it, I will have to accept their word. (How many other

&gt;&gt; Ha, ha. I don't know, but you just go right ahead and accept their
&gt;&gt; word. Me, I'm planning on constituting a new form of government with
&gt;&gt; some old Topps baseball card stats and the text from an old VCR
&gt;&gt; instruction manual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That Jonson was a pensioner of a lord, not a mister, with the initials
&gt;&gt;&gt; W.H., tells me that Herbert was so true a lover of the arts that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; patronized both Shakespeare (or his company) and Jonson. Otherwise,
&gt;&gt;&gt; so what?

So, Toby, you REALLY think Dave's telling us how little evidence
exists concerning the names of actors in Elizabethan acting companies
is a mere EXCUSE for the fact that we don't know what company
Shakespeare acted in before 1595, or whenever? When is an argument an
argument and not an excuse? When it asserts the existence of a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paid endorsement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes it a lie? (If it was a paid endorsement, which isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily what it was. For instance, he may have written the poem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because he wanted to, then let it be used in the First Folio, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted or not accepted money for it.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At or about the same time as the publication of the FF, Ben Jonson was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a pensioner by the grace of William Herbert (Mr. W.H., anyone?), one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of two incomparable and dedicated bretheren. Regardless of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinion of the mad hatters who besiege you with their otherness,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't that factoid give you any pause at all in assessing Jonson's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motivations as the FF's overseer?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting: you give me what seems to be an actual fact for once--but
&gt;&gt;&gt; call it a &quot;factoid!&quot;

&gt;&gt; You're right. That's a careless use of a careless word.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you throw me a factoid as if it were a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact: Jonson's being the First Folio's overseer.

&gt;&gt; I'd almost swear to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He contributed TWO (correction)
&gt;&gt;&gt; poems to it, Toby.

&gt;&gt; And more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Heminges and Condell said THEY oversaw it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for demonstrating why your reasoning is so poor. THINK about
&gt;&gt; what you just wrote. Is it reasonable to suppose that Heminge and
&gt;&gt; Condell only authored one thing in their whole lives and it just
&gt;&gt; happened to be the prefatory words to the First Folio? That is to ask,
&gt;&gt; have you ever read anything else by either of these two? Why not? Are
&gt;&gt; you going to pull some excuse out of your ass about the survivability
&gt;&gt; of mansucripts? THEY said THEY oversaw the FF! Well, sheeit, Paw!
&gt;&gt; Guess we just take 'em at dere word!

&gt; No, wack. We consider the facts, and there is just one in this case:
&gt; their testimony that they oversaw the compilation of the First Folio.

"/>

There are 20,000 authorial emendations in the First Folio,
new scenes, 2,000 new lines not found in any quarto,
many new scenes and at least FOUR NEW UNPREVIOUSLY
UNHEARD OF PLAYS which makes Heminge and Condell LIARS.
There are eight plays that may be entirely new--Strats argue about
the references to four of the plays. Furthermore Strats have
never been able to explain the ms or quarto sources for many
of the plays which means that the TRUE AUTHOR was sitting
on sources that were used for the First Folio.

That makes your theory PURE CRAP, Grumman. Heminges
and Condell were LIARS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Unless you count the negative evidence, to wit: that no one of the
&gt; time said they did not oversee it.) You ignore this because it
&gt; doesn't fit your rigidniplex. It doesn't prove they oversaw the
&gt; compilation of the First Folio, and it is not insane to believe it
&gt; possible that they did not. It IS insane to dogmatically assert that
&gt; they did so.

Strats live in a Liars Culture. The lies have been passed down
for centuries and Liars Cultures eventually make the descendents

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I believe they did but don't consider it certain beyond reasonable

&gt; Almost, though. Who would have known the plays of Shakespeare better
&gt; than they? Why would Jonson's helping them with their prefaces, or
&gt; even writing those prefaces, make him the First Folio's overseer?

"/>

Jonson's style is easily detected in Heminges and Condell.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can find hard evidence, or even sensible soft evidence, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson oversaw it, I will have to accept their word. (How many other

&gt;&gt; Ha, ha. I don't know, but you just go right ahead and accept their
&gt;&gt; word. Me, I'm planning on constituting a new form of government with
&gt;&gt; some old Topps baseball card stats and the text from an old VCR
&gt;&gt; instruction manual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That Jonson was a pensioner of a lord, not a mister, with the initials
&gt;&gt;&gt; W.H., tells me that Herbert was so true a lover of the arts that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; patronized both Shakespeare (or his company) and Jonson. Otherwise,
&gt;&gt;&gt; so what?

Otherwise THE POLITICS of the Shakespeare plays to which
Strats are blinded. The politics are Anglican-Puritan just

&gt; Foster has explained the W.H. to my satisfaction.

"/>

Foster was conjecturing since there is no evidence
other than the fact that there are two Baconian ciphers
in the Dedication, the &quot;dots&quot; reinforce the more superficial
cipher, the Adventurer theme fit both Bacon and his
cousin William Herbert who were, in fact Adventurers,
the underlying cipher is in the form of the Dudley-Sidney
pheon belonging to Herbert and the best candidate for
the Dark Lady since she was buried in sonnets and poems
from the Rival Poets, Lady Mary Wroth.

T.T. wrote other dedicatory letters, one as an
Adventurer to Captain John Smith's Historie of Virginia
and the Summer Isles, a work which has Bacon's fingerprints
all over it. And of course the Stratford Hustler has
been disqualified with the fact that Baconians can come
up with the Strachey letter THAT ALL STRATS AGREE
is a source for The Tempest and their pathetic candidate
cannot.

You'll notice that the sub-genius Webb couldn't answer
a simple question about the Strachey letter posed by
Dave More.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If it was bogus,
&gt; who says it referred to a W.H.? How about H.M.? (to be read
&gt; upside-down) His Majesty. Maybe W.H. was short for &quot;who.&quot; Or
&gt; somebody named U.U.W. Or E.I., the letters being read sideways. Or
&gt; W.H. is in a code known only to Peacham for B.G.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don't know what company he acted in before he joined the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's men.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But you're CERTAIN that he did?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe it is 99% likely. He was definitely an actor, and actors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually start acting before they're thirty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And we all go to Florida to die.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ooops, I just remembered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greenes Groatsworth, which makes it 100% certain he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 1592.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least nominally.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, actually. Greene had no reason to lie, and he was very familiar
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the London theatre of his time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it make any difference if Greene was NOT the author and if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pamphlet from which that allusion comes was blasted at the time as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; big pack of lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt; A little. But Chettle would then probably have been the author, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he would have been almost as knowledgeable about the literary scene as
&gt;&gt;&gt; Greene.

&gt;&gt; Possibly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He would have no reason to lie, either. The fact that Nashe
&gt;&gt;&gt; condemned the Groatsworth as lies means little since he did that after
&gt;&gt;&gt; being accused of having written it, so could be expected to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted to distance himself as far as possible from it. It is even
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible that he hadn't even read it before pronouncing it a lying
&gt;&gt;&gt; pamphlet.

&gt;&gt; My point is that the GGW is a very controversial little pamphlet and
&gt;&gt; was considered to be a bunch of crap IN ITS OWN TIME.

&gt; Hey, maybe that's why Shakespeare complained about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If he called Shakespeare an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor, Shakespeare was almost certainly an actor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As I conceded, I am inclined to agree, but the allusion is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY clear (see Kathman's careful language in this regard).

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, but it's clear enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (He didn't insult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him as a play-broker who now had the audacity to think he could write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blank verse, which would have been even more telling than calling him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an actor, I would think.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Diana Price did important work on all of that. Didn't you read her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; book?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. I made up all the things I quoted from it in the many posts to
&gt;&gt;&gt; HLAS on it that I made. That my comment just before yours is an
&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious reference to her insane notion that Shakespeare was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; play-broker is just a coincidence.

&gt;&gt; That's the spirit! See how much better a quip you can make when you
&gt;&gt; stop trying to be creative?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Greene describes him as an actor who is now trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to bombast out blank verse such as the line in Henry VI, part i, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would seem he'd been an actor for some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you that this new line of work that Shakspere the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor took up ---to the chagrin of his contemporaries--- was perceived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a lot of phony baloney?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if there was a nut scenario I haven't considered.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But an actor pretending to write plays is not going to make real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playwrights fear they'll lose their markets.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless those plays he supplies are a cut above any pretense. [Greene]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or Chettle or whoever it was was saying that this cat's full of crap
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coming around here with his slick blank verse and aren't we all a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little worried about who (or what) he is? Watch out: he's playing with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a marked deck and is a JACK of all trades. He didn't pay his dues and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't go to school with any of us. Where does he get off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And a pretender doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write actual quoted lines from plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that a law or something or do I just not understand your point?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read my essay on this. I don't feel like going through it again.

&gt;&gt; There's a lot of that going around.

&gt; Tell me why I should repeat myself on this topic when

My impression of current American sitcoms is that they'd be cancelled

I tend to think the British are more sophisticated than Americans, but
on reflection I think the truth is that the British media, for some
reason, tries to entertain more intelligent people than the American
media does. In other words, it could be that the percentage of
intelligent Americans equals the percentage of intelligent Britishers
but that our media, not being for intelligent people, wrongly suggests
we're more stupid than we are. To be VERY simplistic about it.

This is, simplistic or not, surely true. from the start England has had
the BBC, a broadcaster that (being funded by a special tax on owners of TVs)
need pay no attention to ratings. In Australia we have a similar

potentially subject in practice (though not, of course, in theory) to

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,
But antiquated and deserted lie,
As they were not of Nature's family.
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.
For though the poet's matter nature be,
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same ...

From my knowledge of the English media, I'd say the truth is more

is a notable exception), and so very few Americans have any idea of how
bad the worst of the English media is; but there are daily newspapers in
England that make the New York Post look like a model of taste and
restraint. The English love to export their top-quality stuff, possibly
hoping to give the impression that, e.g., all of their cartoonists are
as talented as Brian Bolland and Alan Moore; they must shiver in fear
that someday foreigners will find out about Beano (see
).

U.S. media productions are generally neither as good as the best English
productions nor as bad as the worst: to oversimplify, English media is
divided between highbrow and lowbrow, while U.S. media is principally
middlebrow, neither hot nor cold.

IMHO, the show was never focused on social satire, or anything else;
there was some satirical content, sure, but it was always a bit vague.
What 'The Simpsons' once excelled at was a kind of manic, free-for-all
parody of everything and anything, with believable, sympathetic
characters at the center. Unfortunately, I no longer find the
characters believable or sympathetic, and I find the writing to be
unbearably repetitive. 'The Simpsons,' which used to make fun of
cartoons like 'The Itchy and Scratchy Show,' has effectively *become*
'The Itchy and Scratchy Show.'

The US has five different actors unions, not counting some ethnic ones.

Actors Equity -- legitimate theatre and &quot;musicals&quot;.
Screen Actor's Guild -- motion pictures and filmed television.
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists -- radio and live
and taped television (the exact demarcation has been a bit fuzzy of
late, due to the introduction of film-quality digital video).
American Guild of Variety Artists -- originally vaudeville, now chiefly
concerned with Las Vegas and Disney World, etc..
American Guild of Musical Artists -- opera (singers only).

Furthermore, nearly all theatre activity is concentrated in New York,
while nearly all film and television is concentrated in Los Angeles.
While many individual performers are members of three or more of the
five unions, few stars change, except for young stars who migrate
&quot;upward&quot; from television to motion pictures (many of them having already
migrated, alas, &quot;upward&quot; from stage to television). A US &quot;As Time Goes
By&quot; starring a US equivalent to Judi Dench is pretty much unthinkable,
and, on the other hand, Mira Furlan, recognized in Europe as one of the
greatest actresses of our time, has been cursed with the label &quot;Sci-Fi

I'll grant you that. The ease with which English actors move between
the stage, television, and movies is remarkable. I would also add that

&gt; of the most thoroughly yummy, multishaded roles ever written for an
&gt; actress in any medium.

You will have to pardon me for differing with that opinion. I don't
doubt that Mira Furlan has considerable talent, but IMHO the writing on
Babylon 5 was much better suited for an actor of Bruce Boxleitner's
stature. Frankly, I prefer Straczynski's work on &quot;He-Man and the
Masters of the Universe,&quot; which had the advantage of being completely
fucking insane.

Here's the drudge of HLAS. A thread starts out that promises a task
for us all, inviting us to study Elizabethan stage practice, maybe to
discover something new, un-noticed, or even to express a reasonable
opinion. And here we are a short time later, talking about the Simpson
show.

The Strats always wish to draw the anti-Strats into these no-use
subjects, nothing answering to a question, both sides stinking of
herring. Or else going at each other like a couple of drag queens.
&quot;Oh, listen to what the bitch said, everybody witnessed it, coming on

This explanation of the exclusions won't do.&quot;Henry VIII&quot; was
included in the Folio by Heminge and Condell, or by the wish of
whomever they were serving as fronts ; and if the present stylistic
tests are valid,or if,in fact, any of the major stylistic tests

valid , the attribution to Fletcher is correct.
To complicate matters further, a consistent application of the
verse tests gives Wolsey's &quot;Farewell, a long farewell, to all my

And to complicate matters further yet,of the four nobles who arrest
Wolsey in the play,only two names coincide with the historical
account.The other two are two of the four nobles who removed the Great
Seal from Francis Bacon a comparatively short time before the Folio
publication.One of these two was Lord Pembroke who was co-dedicate of

Unless Shakspere were alive at least five years after the well
authenticated report of his death,we should be putting the word
&quot;collaboration&quot; in quotes in respect to the Fletcher materials
contained in the First Folio.

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST

QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,
But antiquated and deserted lie,
As they were not of Nature's family.
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.
For though the poet's matter nature be,
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same ...

&gt; of his time due to his close associations with
&gt; the court of King James, and would certainly
&gt; have heard any rumours involving the Earl
&gt; of Oxenforde if there had been any related
&gt; to playwrighting.
&gt; Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
&gt; typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
&gt; are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
&gt; William Drummond&quot;:

&gt;&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
&gt; children: but no poet.&quot;

&gt;&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
&gt; performed what he promised to write, the deeds
&gt; of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
&gt; long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&gt;&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
&gt; world, in some things: his verses of the lost
&gt; chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
&gt; 'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
&gt; all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
&gt; all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
&gt; years old.&quot;

&gt; And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
&gt; these conversations is quite typical:

&gt;&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
&gt; saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
&gt; is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

&gt; In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
&gt; criticism with praise:

&gt;&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

&gt; I remember, the players have often
&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
&gt; in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
&gt; blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
&gt; he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
&gt; a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
&gt; this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
&gt; circumstance to commend their friend by,
&gt; wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
&gt; own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
&gt; his memory - on this side idolatry - as
&gt; much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
&gt; an open, and free nature: had an excellent
&gt; fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt; wherein he flowed with that facility, that
&gt; sometime it was necessary he should be
&gt; stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
&gt; of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
&gt; would the rule of it had been so too. Many
&gt; times he fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: as when he said in the person of
&gt; Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
&gt; dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
&gt; wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
&gt; vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
&gt; him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

&gt; Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
&gt; in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
&gt; as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
&gt; shows:

&gt;&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
&gt; It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
&gt; Wherein the Graver had a strife
&gt; with Nature, to out-doo the life :
&gt; O, could he but have drawne his wit
&gt; As well in brasse, as he hath hit
&gt; His face ; the Print would then surpasse
&gt; All, that was ever writ in brasse.
&gt; But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
&gt; Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

&gt; And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
&gt; for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
&gt; quite convinced that the man who acted in
&gt; his plays was a better playwright than
&gt; Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
&gt; Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
&gt; the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
&gt; tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&gt;&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
&gt; MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
&gt; HATH LEFT US.

&gt; To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess thy writings to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
&gt; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
&gt; Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
&gt; For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
&gt; Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
&gt; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
&gt; The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
&gt; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
&gt; And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
&gt; These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
&gt; Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
&gt; But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
&gt; Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
&gt; I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
&gt; The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
&gt; My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
&gt; Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
&gt; A little further, to make thee a room:
&gt; Thou art a monument without a tomb,
&gt; And art alive still while thy book doth live
&gt; And we have wits to read and praise to give.
&gt; That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
&gt; I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
&gt; For if I thought my judgment were of years,
&gt; I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
&gt; And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
&gt; Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
&gt; And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
&gt; From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
&gt; For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
&gt; Euripides and Sophocles to us;
&gt; Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
&gt; To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
&gt; And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
&gt; Leave thee alone for the comparison
&gt; Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
&gt; Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
&gt; Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
&gt; To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
&gt; He was not of an age but for all time!
&gt; And all the Muses still were in their prime,
&gt; When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
&gt; Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!

&gt; Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

&gt; His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
&gt; which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
&gt; his art to Virgil:

&gt; IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
&gt; TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
&gt; (&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in

&gt; LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

&gt; (&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

&gt; Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
&gt; of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
&gt; referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
&gt; Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
&gt; and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
&gt; where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
&gt; all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&gt;&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
&gt; Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
&gt; Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
&gt; called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
&gt; enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
&gt; resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
&gt; Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
&gt; [notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
&gt; and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
&gt; and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&gt;&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&gt;&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
&gt; to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
&gt; (If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
&gt; these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
&gt; heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
&gt; how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
&gt; light of Nature...;&quot;

&gt; In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
&gt; Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
&gt; to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
&gt; the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
&gt; (Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
&gt; excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
&gt; the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
&gt; where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
&gt; tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
&gt; It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&gt;&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&gt; http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/price.html:
&gt;&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
&gt; compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; - notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
&gt; in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
&gt; (from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
&gt; Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
&gt; remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
&gt; his will.&quot;

&gt; In addition:

&gt; That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
&gt; personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
&gt; appears on the list of players who acted in
&gt;&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
&gt; extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&gt;&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
&gt; says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
&gt; and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
&gt; he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
&gt; familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman

&gt; I've never heard of bats squirting shit at each other. This seems to
&gt; be a fantasy that Richard Kennedy has pulled out of his ass and posted
&gt; as fact.

&gt; On the other hand, bats are known for sleeping upside down, with the
&gt; ends facing up. I doubt that bats would shit while in that postion,
&gt; because they would end up covered in their own droppings - and unlike
&gt; Richard Kennedy, bats would have to much sense to enjoy showering in
&gt; their own shit.

"/>

That does seem unlikely, as bats have to spend much time grooming
their fur. There's some information on bat defecatory behavior at:

&quot;Bats urinate and defecate during flight, however, if the need arises
while they are roosting it could be quite messy if they did not change
positions. We have documented bats roosting in a normal 'upside-down'
position, hanging by their hind feet, with the wings folded around
their body. They lift the wings and head to the upright position, take
hold of the roosting structure by their hook-like thumb, let go with
the back feet, and the body pivots downward for defecation and
urination. When ! finished, they return to the normal roosting
position.&quot;

&gt; an open, and free nature: had an excellent
&gt; fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt; wherein he flowed with that facility, that
&gt; sometime it was necessary he should be
&gt; stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
&gt; of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
&gt; would the rule of it had been so too. Many
&gt; times he fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: as when he said in the person of
&gt; Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
&gt; dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
&gt; wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
&gt; vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
&gt; him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

&gt; Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
&gt; in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
&gt; as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
&gt; shows:

&gt;&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
&gt; It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
&gt; Wherein the Graver had a strife
&gt; with Nature, to out-doo the life :
&gt; O, could he but have drawne his wit
&gt; As well in brasse, as he hath hit
&gt; His face ; the Print would then surpasse
&gt; All, that was ever writ in brasse.
&gt; But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
&gt; Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

&gt; And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
&gt; for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
&gt; quite convinced that the man who acted in
&gt; his plays was a better playwright than
&gt; Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
&gt; Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
&gt; the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
&gt; tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&gt;&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
&gt; MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
&gt; HATH LEFT US.

&gt; To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess thy writings to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
&gt; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
&gt; Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
&gt; For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
&gt; Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
&gt; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
&gt; The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
&gt; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
&gt; And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
&gt; These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
&gt; Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
&gt; But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
&gt; Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
&gt; I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
&gt; The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
&gt; My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
&gt; Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
&gt; A little further, to make thee a room:
&gt; Thou art a monument without a tomb,
&gt; And art alive still while thy book doth live
&gt; And we have wits to read and praise to give.
&gt; That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
&gt; I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
&gt; For if I thought my judgment were of years,
&gt; I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
&gt; And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
&gt; Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
&gt; And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
&gt; From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
&gt; For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
&gt; Euripides and Sophocles to us;
&gt; Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
&gt; To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
&gt; And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
&gt; Leave thee alone for the comparison
&gt; Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
&gt; Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
&gt; Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
&gt; To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
&gt; He was not of an age but for all time!
&gt; And all the Muses still were in their prime,
&gt; When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
&gt; Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
&gt; Nature herself was proud of his

&gt; My understanding is that 16th century Mystery Plays
&gt; were sponsored by the guilds, the pageant wagons
&gt; were built by guild craftsmen and the performers
&gt; were almost always members of the guild.

&gt;&gt; and also
&gt;&gt; presumably they had a regular and predictable
&gt;&gt; use.

&gt; As far as I know, they were employed during the
&gt; production of the Mystery Play cycles and
&gt; at no other times. (ie. During the feast
&gt; of Corpus Christi.) That is indeed both
&gt; predictable and regular, but I don't think
&gt; that &quot;once a year&quot; is the sort of predictability
&gt; and regularity you were shooting for.

"/>

Earlier we saw an image of a pageant wagon in
use in what seems to be Jacobean times -- from
the style of clothing, and so on. That would rule
out Mystery Plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; . . I think we can
&gt;&gt; assume that a touring company would prefer
&gt;&gt; a circular tour, meaning that all roads would
&gt;&gt; be new (that year) to them and a cart could
&gt;&gt; readily get stuck at an unexpected location --

&gt; I think the worst spots tended to be pretty well
&gt; known.

"/>

About seven years ago I saw the Avon in such a
state of flood that modern traffic was completely
impossible. Admittedly that was a once-in-thirty-
year event but around 1600 smaller (and quite
unexpected) floods would have often destroyed
local roads and bridges.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To be sure, if the professional acting companies
&gt; were performing the same little playlet multiple times
&gt; in one day in multiple locations, they might have
&gt; wanted something like a pageant wagon, however, I
&gt; don't think it is known that any Elizabethan
&gt; professional acting company ever did such a thing.

"/>

They certainly attended local fairs -- as on their
trips through Stratford. A large wagon might
have been the most convenient form of stage
in some locations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't see the problem. If you are willing to
&gt; imagine that they took post horses without
&gt; mentioning them, it seems to me that you could
&gt; just as easily imagine that he failed to mention
&gt; the servant that trailed along behind the coach
&gt; with a string of hired horses.

"/>

Quite possibly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; J Crofts in _Packhorse, Waggon, and Post_
&gt; wrote that in Elizabeth's time, a private
&gt; post rider had to pay 3d per mile. (Those
&gt; with official warrants paid considerably less.)

&gt; I can't say that I know how often horses
&gt; went lame or for that matter, how long it
&gt; usually took them to recover, but the
&gt; price differential between post horses
&gt; and hired horses was so large,

"/>

It is not the least bit safe to rely on reported
figures of that sort and the supposed
'differential'. A hired horse is a hired horse,
and would not cost much different per day
under one system of hiring than another.
Travelling fast across country they'd use,
say, double or treble the number of horses
(each horse having to rest up for the next
day) and have to pay boys for their time.
They'd have needed a local guide in any
event. But they'd save on inns and meals,
and avoid the trouble and inconvenience of
finding beds in uninteresting places and
probably flea-ridden inns. IMO the overall
costs of the faster journey would probably
be lower but, in any case, quite preferable to
travellers of that sort.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Lots of people have reportedly found the English
&gt; countryside interesting enough to go on walking
&gt; tours.

"/>

I'd bet 'walking tours' -- anywhere, let alone
in ordinary rural countryside -- were not
known in Elizabethan times. And it helps
when you speak the local language. It can
be very boring otherwise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I am saying that high degrees of differences
&gt;&gt; in class lead to an intensity of consciousness
&gt;&gt; as regards status that encourages exaggeration
&gt;&gt; or 'lying' -- of the sort we see here, or with
&gt;&gt; Hyacinth Bucket. A puritan tradition that, on
&gt;&gt; the surface at least, disparages all that, can
&gt;&gt; develop much straighter (and more honest)
&gt;&gt; codes of behaviour.

&gt; And that's enough to let you predict that a late
&gt; 16th century German lawyer writing a travel book,
&gt; for the purposes of exaggerating his status, would
&gt; leave out the mention of post horses(probably the
&gt; most expensive method of long distance travel
&gt; anywhere in Europe)

Posting was routine for members of the upper
classes. It was scarcely worth the mention.
Coach travel was fairly unusual -- and worth
a passing mention.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in the hopes that his readers
&gt; would think that he and his companions rode 150 or
&gt; so miles in a hired trendy vehicle, that may or
&gt; may not have been thought trendy in Germany.

"/>

That part of Germany would, almost certainly, have
been like the rest of Europe, with coaches being
rare and used only by the top-most aristocrats,
and then only on the better roads. (Remember
that in 1599 on a routine progress, the 66-year-
old Queen and her party rode on horseback from
Hampton Court to Nonsuch.)

&gt;&gt; It's set in in a rural village in
&gt;&gt; 'Borsetshire' not far from Stratford-upon-Avon.
&gt;&gt; All serious students of Shakespeare should be
&gt;&gt; familiar with it -- _especially_ if they are
&gt;&gt; American. Many of the ancient traditions and
&gt;&gt; attitudes of the English live on in such places
&gt;&gt; and institutions -- and they are never articulated
&gt;&gt; in academic or other kinds of media.

&gt; How does one tell if a tradition or attitude
&gt; never articulated elsewhere but heard on

We understand numerous things which we

&gt;&gt; The other difference from the US is that BBC

&gt; Having never heard Radio 4, it doesn't seem
&gt; right for me to try to dispute this. On the
&gt; other hand, it doesn't seem too likely that you
&gt; are personally acquainted with the offerings of
&gt; our NPR, so perhaps I should take your comparison
&gt; with a grain of salt.

"/>

There is a world of a difference. There is a
_class_ of person in Britain that listens to
Radio 4 (often disdaining TV entirely or
largely so). So most programmes can rely on
most of its audience knowing about most of
the other programs -- and often being right
up to date on the current story taking place
in 'The Archers'. There is an in-group or a
culture with constant jokes and references.
This class thing, with an intense localisation
(by American standards) is highly effective
in creating and maintaining a kind of culture
fostering literary awareness and output.

&gt; Are we really to suppose that Hamlet didn't have
&gt;&quot;friendly&quot; feelings for the players?

"/>

The question is whether or not those players
would have regarded themselves as Hamlet's
friends, or used such terms towards him. Would
Hamlet would have expected a 'friendly reception'
from them. It's not unlike the use of 'thou'. A
lower-status person is not permitted to 'thou' an
upper-class person (nor claim friendship) without
specific permission. A higher-status one can
permissibly 'patronise' a lower-status one with
such terms.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have plenty of contemporary testimony regarding

&gt;&gt; Italian becoming the 'linqua franca'. That
&gt;&gt; indicates that few (even among the most
&gt;&gt; educated) felt comfortable using it.

&gt; Whatever the reason for Italian becoming the
&gt; language of choice for diplomacy and trade, it's
&gt; quite obvious that in England at least, Latin
&gt; was the primary topic in the grammar schools.

We get an incredible amount of bullshit talked
about language-use. Of the ~7 million French-

they do not speak or understand English.
(Dr Victor Goldbloom, Commissioner of Official
Languages of Canada -- speaking in 1998.)
You probably know more French Canadians
than me, but I very much doubt that figure.
Half a million people in this country claim (in
census returns) to be able to speak Irish (Gaelic)

Henztler does not report on the funeral -- so we

I'm sure that they wanted to know why, but

&gt; FWIW, in 1599 Platter's coachman was a carrier

Nathan is having trouble with the bat metaphor. Let's say then that
Reynolds is like a cow pissing on a flat rock, which is Spam Scone.

&gt;&gt; My understanding is that 16th century Mystery Plays
&gt;&gt; were sponsored by the guilds, the pageant wagons
&gt;&gt; were built by guild craftsmen and the performers
&gt;&gt; were almost always members of the guild.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and also
&gt;&gt;&gt; presumably they had a regular and predictable
&gt;&gt;&gt; use.

&gt;&gt; As far as I know, they were employed during the
&gt;&gt; production of the Mystery Play cycles and
&gt;&gt; at no other times. (ie. During the feast
&gt;&gt; of Corpus Christi.) That is indeed both
&gt;&gt; predictable and regular, but I don't think
&gt;&gt; that &quot;once a year&quot; is the sort of predictability
&gt;&gt; and regularity you were shooting for.

&gt; Earlier we saw an image of a pageant wagon in
&gt; use in what seems to be Jacobean times -- from
&gt; the style of clothing, and so on. That would rule
&gt; out Mystery Plays.

The painter(Denis van Alsloot) was Flemish. In 1610, he
was the court painter for the Spanish regent in
Brussels. Judging from what's at

I'm guessing the image is that of a pageant wagon
in Brussels.

&gt;&gt;&gt; a circular tour, meaning that all roads would

&gt;&gt; I think the worst spots tended to be pretty well

&gt; About seven years ago I saw the Avon in such a

&gt; unexpected) floods would have often destroyed
&gt; local roads and bridges.

I think that quite overstates the usual effects of small
floods.

I've seen a few early references to floods washing away
bridges. In all cases, the floods were thought to be
remarkable.

For any who might be interested in a history of the flooding
of the Avon, there's one at

Most of the history is from more recent times, but there
is a little bit about an incident in 1587 when both
ends of the Clopton bridge were washed out.

&gt;&gt; To be sure, if the professional acting companies

&gt;&gt; don't think it is known that any Elizabethan
&gt;&gt; professional acting company ever did such a thing.

&gt; They certainly attended local fairs -- as on their
&gt; trips through Stratford. A large wagon might
&gt; have been the most convenient form of stage

A large wagon -&gt; at best, a very small stage -&gt; not very convenient
for reasonably large scale productions.

&gt;&gt; I don't see the problem. If you are willing to
&gt;&gt; imagine that they took post horses without
&gt;&gt; mentioning them, it seems to me that you could
&gt;&gt; just as easily imagine that he failed to mention
&gt;&gt; the servant that trailed along behind the coach
&gt;&gt; with a string of hired horses.

&gt; Quite possibly.

&gt;&gt; J Crofts in _Packhorse, Waggon, and Post_
&gt;&gt; wrote that in Elizabeth's time, a private
&gt;&gt; post rider had to pay 3d per mile. (Those
&gt;&gt; with official warrants paid considerably less.)

&gt;&gt; I can't say that I know how often horses
&gt;&gt; went lame or for that matter, how long it
&gt;&gt; usually took them to recover, but the
&gt;&gt; price differential between post horses
&gt;&gt; and hired horses was so large,

&gt; It is not the least bit safe to rely on reported
&gt; figures of that sort and the supposed
&gt; 'differential'.

"/>

The 3d/mile charge for the private riders of post
horses was by Elizabethan statute, so that at least,
should be pretty accurate.

As I posted earlier, _London in 1731_(written
by someone writing as Don Manoel Gonzales) put
the cost for a &quot;good horse&quot; at 4s/day.

Daniel Paterson gave another list of costs in his
_Paterson's Hampshire_ published in 1785. (Viewable at
)
He said the hire of a saddle horse was 6s 6d per day.
Obviously, the rate given by Gonzales is fairly
consistent with the one given 54 years later.

Judging from rates given by Gonzales and Paterson,
the average yearly price inflation in hire horse
rates in the 1731-85 era was less than 1%.

Taking that rate and projecting it back to 1600,
it seems that the cost for Hentzner to hire a horse
would have been well under 4d per day. Just two
datapoints on the line, but I think the projection
is probably in the ballpark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A hired horse is a hired horse,
&gt; and would not cost much different per day
&gt; under one system of hiring than another.

"/>

Not true. Post riders didn't have to
return their horses to the point of
origin. That alone should double the
price. Most of the time, the riders
would have had to pay something for the
postboy and his horse. IIRC, the rate
for riders with official warrants was
1d/mile which was acknowledged to be
below cost. Part of the extra 2d/mile that
the private riders paid went to subsidize
the official use. (The rest provided the
postmaster with his profit margin.)

I'm pretty sure that the postmaster, knowing
that his horses would suffer the extra wear
and tear of being ridden at 8 or 9 miles
would argue that if he had to replace his
horses more frequently, he should be able
to charge a higher rate. (Of course,
postmastes didn't set their own rates,
but at the very least, the postmasters,
when they argued for an increase could make
that point.)

Unless you are supposing that the travelers each

We've been over this. Whether in London,
Cambridge, Oxford, or on the road, they'd
have been spending money on inns and meals.
It's possible that inns and meals cost much
more outside of London, but I wouldn't count
on it.

Should we suppose that the inns in London,
Cambridge, and Oxford were not flea-ridden?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IMO the overall
&gt; costs of the faster journey would probably
&gt; be lower

"/>

A closer look at the probable per rider costs:

It'd have been around a 200 mile journey, so the
posthorse transportation costs per person
on the Hentzner London-Cambridge-Oxford-London
route would have been around 2l 10s. Doing
the 90 miles between Cambridge and Oxford
in one day would have been fairly
extraordinary, so they'd probably have
spent at least one night in some inn between
those two towns.

From everything I've read, a good horse
can fairly easily do 30 miles for several
days in a row, so if the Hentzner party
had hired horses, they'd probably have
overnighted once between London and
Cambridge, twice between Cambridge and
Oxford, and once between Oxford and
London. (That's three more nights in
inns outside a &quot;big&quot; city than they'd
have spent if they'd ridden post.) All
told, it's 7 days travel. If we suppose
that they wanted to spend a week in Cambridge
and a week in London, the charge per
person for a hired horse should have been
around 4s 2d. Subtracting that from
2l 10s, leaves 2l 5s 10p. I am not sure
what it cost to feed a horse for three
weeks, but I doubt it was as much as
the cost of the hire. Even if it were
so much, that'd still leave the traveler
with better than 2 pounds savings. I can't
imagine there were many country inns where
the charge was anything close to 13s per night.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but, in any case, quite preferable to
&gt; travellers of that sort.

"/>

Or maybe not.

Up until the turn of the 16th century, at
least, coach travel was looked on as somewhat
effeminate. I think the implication in
that is that it was seen as &quot;easy&quot;. Inside
the coach, one was quite protected from the
elements. Sleep was possible. Travel
at night was easier. (Well, not for the
coachman.) Bringing a fair amount of
luggage becomes reasonable.

The postmasters had monopolies and their
charges per mile were independent of the
quality of the horse they lent out. That
being so, it is not too surprising that
there were a fair number of people who
complained about the inferior quality
of the posthorses they were issued.
If a foreign noble had good connections
at Court, they might well receive the
best a stable could offer, but you've
been assuming that Hentzner's patron
was generally treated like dirt. Needless
to say, if he was wealthy enough to ride
post, he could rather easily have hired
an extremely fine horse.

Additionally, if the roads were quite bad,
the advantage of riding post would be
pretty much nullified. (The danger of
the horse putting a hoof in a pothole would
presumably be enough keep the rider traveling
at a slower rate.)

One of the problems faced by Hentzner's noble,
is that if he rode post, he'd probably have
had to obtain a horse for each member of his
retinue. (Not many servants can trot along
at 7 or 8 miles an hour for a large part
of a day.) Assuming that he travelled with
luggage commensurate with his station, he'd
probably have had to hire a couple of post
horses just for that.

Commercial brewing became big in the 18th to 19th centuries. Brewing
ale was known to the Egyptians. Brewing in Britain is referred to by
Roman sources. Ale seems to have become the sole national drink under
the Anglo-Saxons. Later some people started to brew in larger
quantities to supplement home brewing. The Domesday book records 43
brewers. The Brewery of Queen's College Oxford was founded in 1340 and
lasted until 1939. In 1267 Henry III introduced the Assize of Bread
and Ale. Beer was not brewed until the 16th century as the
introduction of hopped ale was resisted.
