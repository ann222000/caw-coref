Most of us start with TEST TEST TEST to gain a knowledge of food's
effects on us.

However, one of the valuable side effects of frequent testing for me has
been self-control. High numbers after problem foods make me want to do
better the next time.

On the other hand, I could see some people getting accustomed to high
numbers and getting desensitized to their meaning.

We know that frequent testing is associated with better blood glucose
control from research.

But what accounts for the better control: food knowledge or a developed
self-control resulting from alarming meter readings?

More likely it's a mix of both, but how much of the improvement is
self-control?

Can we depend on frequent testing to develop our self control?

Can we recommend it to others for this purpose?

That is a good question.  For me, there is definitely a connection between
frequent testing and maintaining self control.  In addition,  if I have a
fairly high pp number I will eat fewer carbs at the next meal or, in he
case of dinner, eat no carbs if I snack at all.  Were I not to keep
testing several times a day (nowhere near what I had to do in early days
of finding what I could eat) I am sure that I woul dbe having much higher
bgs and an A1c well in excess of the 5/4 I had at the last test a few
weeks ago.

I fine the same thing with weight.  I weigh myself every morning adn ,
even thugh I am not loosing weight, this keeps me from gainin, as I
immediately adjust y food if I not a small weight gain.  I have omore than
maintained my current weight(70lbs below my diagnosis weight) for over 20
years.  I'm not loosing, but I am not balooning back up as I would were I
not careful.

I think we can say for sure that without frequent testing--at least
when we are familiarizing ourselves with which foods do what--no self
control can be developed.  Without knowledge, achieving self control
is impossible.  For myself, now that I know which foods do what, I
don't deviate, so I rely more on spot-checking.  However, if I'm
trying a new food, I'm sure to test.

Other factors may come into play besides simple logic.  For myself, I
feel physically bad if I eat something that spikes my BG, but other
people may not experience this.  They have no immediate feedback
against eating a BG-spiking food other than logic--the number on their
meter.  I've also had the benefit of having worked in a hospital and
seeing the ravages that can be inflicted on uncontrolled diabetic
patients.  This gives me an emotional association in the form of fear
of to avoid BG-spiking foods.  Both of these points figure into my
personal self-control.  However, if a person does not have these or
other methods for maintaing self-control, the only other item s/he can
rely on is what the meter is saying.  In this case, I would definitely
recommend frequent testing.

Nothing is full-proof; people can always choose to not to alter their
lifestyles, but the meter at least gives us a means to attempt to
control our BGs.

I'm glad you added weight and scales. I've found regular
measurement of both BG's and weight helps in many ways,
discipline being part of it. It also gives early warning
when we start to slip; one or two high numbers can be a
glitch, but sustained over a few days show that a review of
menu and activity is needed.

Is this not a development of the headology themes that we've been
exploring recently? At dx, testing produces Doh! moments that inform
us that our WOE needs to be altered drastically. As we progress away
from dx, using testing to monitor progress gives a continuing sense of
achievement, and so contributes to overall well being. Once you've
plateaued, testing remains a method of disciplining yourself, as well
as answering food questions. It's less relevant as an immediate
motivational tool, because you lose novelty and have to ongoing gains;
but it is nevertheless essential.
