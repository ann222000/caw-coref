As usual 400% more bang for the buck in the Windows/Linux world.  $500 for
Intels latest quad core proc machine! Nice, and you aren't burdened with
Apple's super  buggy OS X!!!

Hmm... Snit should be looking at this... he's been talking about buying a new
machine with the ability to run Windows...

--
The biggies for me in getting a new machine, Steve, are:
* Speed (my G4 800, while a fine machine, is simply getting dated)
* Webcam (I do not have one now)
* Ability to run Windows (Virtual PC will not do)

Some things I would like:
* Wireless Internet for making quick wireless networks
--

Granted, this thing has no webcam but with the money he'd save by buying it (as
opposed to a mid to high level iMac) he could afford an inexpensive DV cam to
tape his family with (as well as use as a webcam). Add the price of a Mac mini
and he's probably still under what he would have spent on a mid to high end
iMac. He'd have a machine that''ll run Windows way better than an iMac, a DV cam
and a Mac that is more powerful than his current tower. Plus... he wouldn't have
to worry about his iMac going down and taking down his entire business... if
either computer choked he could still use the other one.

I have considered getting two machines... but it does not make much sense
for my needs.  A mini cannot even use dual monitors - something that is
pretty important for my work.  If I were getting a tower *and* had the money
to spend above and beyond that I *might* get a PC and a KVM switch, but the
downsides of that likely would not offset the benefits.  Add to that the
extra room and energy and heat output and it really is not something I am
likely to do.

Huh? Last time I looked, it was $500 for just the chip.

As for &quot;buggy&quot; OS X, Windows Vista is the single biggest reason I may
*yet* be persuaded to take the terrifying gamble of going to the Mac
platform. Even if it's rock-solid reliable, unlike some previous
versions of Windows, it apparently has other faults: i.e., slow,
bloated. Maybe I'm being unfair to Vista, though, since you can turn off
the new features.

Look, the Mac has one big problem. Hardly any software. Since software
is what a computer is *for*, it's not necessary to _make up_ reasons to
not buy a Mac.

Multiplatform KVM switches are horribly overpriced, because only big
businesses buy them. If you can just use a standard USB KVM switch, of
course, they can be cheap.

But a new machine &quot;with the ability to run Windows&quot; can now be just a
new Mac. If most of your work is done on the Mac, then why not upgrade
and have the ability to make *full* use of your second machine?

It's people who have been Wintel users and who don't have a feel for how
much Mac software is available in their area or for their favored
application to whom I could not recommend the Mac. For most of them,
saying that &quot;the Mac is dead&quot;, however false that seems from a
Mac-user's perspective, may well accurately sum up the situation _they_
would face.

I see no reason to change to Windows if you're happy with the Mac
either, so if you do need something *from* Windows, choose the option
that involves the least cost. Getting a Mac and putting Windows on it,
compared to buying a Windows PC, gives you a second Mac &quot;for free&quot;
almost. How can one argue with such a deal?

Is this true? I have purchased HP notebooks over the past few
months as an HP retiree and have not seen a choice for Windows
XP on any of them. Vista Home Premium is the recommended version
in my experience and Vista has some significant compatability
problems in my limited experience. YMMV. Makes me happy, though,
to not have Vista installed anywhere in my home.

Well, in many cases, you're right. Enough programs are also available
for the Macintosh that perhaps for many purposes, no real disadvantage
exists for a Macintosh user.

Given that a Mac has the ability of running programs meant for BSD as
well, you have a greater ability to write your own programs - or use the
software written for the Linux platform - than you do for Windows.
(Although GCC and g95 have been ported to Windows too, it might be
argued.)

But if your intended application happens to be slightly unusual, it may
be that there really is NO program to do the work you want for the
Macintosh.

Yes; showing people, or using examples that demonstrate that it's
false. There are not just enough programs for Mac OS, there are too
many for any one user to try.
But that's why there are advocacy groups and places to talk about it --
so people will hear that side.

You know, I still hear people use the word 'compatible' without having
nay idea what part they are talking about -- they are just panicked
about the word. it doesn't help that some morons keep claiming that
this or that isn't compatible, especially when most of it just doesn't
matter.

What I mean is, it doesn't make any difference that there are 100 video
cards that are not compatible with Mac hardware; no one tells those
people that there are 20 that are, and they do the same things. They
also don't say that Windows isn't compatible with any of those. (But
plenty of Windows users routinely claim Windows is compatible with
*all* hardware, and some even claim there are never driver issues!)

When people say something is a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, that means it's an obvious
course of action, that doesn't require much intelligence to see - not
that it's a stupid course of action, that more intelligence would help
one to avoid.

Of course, the way Microsoft prices its software, there is one obvious
thing that Apple can offer that the competition can't. The Mac Pro is
the only dual-processor machine out there that is readily available that
I'm aware of.

But Apple doesn't have to worry about the limits Microsoft has set for
anything less than Windows Server 2003.

Instead of just doing the obvious - and putting two quad-core chips in -
they could offer a four-chip motherboard, or an eight-chip motherboard.
With Windows, the software pricing would be astronomical.

Apple would be offering something you can't get in the Windows world,
with unmatched price/performance. Of course, it would still be
expensive, and there might not be enough demand, so I can understand
they would be hesitant.

To a certain degree, we can use our past history:  how many 'new'
applications have we considered over the past ~3 years?

Of course, another related question is to examine the purpose of
running these applications:  if this is for business, then a second
(or third, or fourth) computer on your desk is merely a cost of doing
business.

FWIW, it is perhaps ironic that in such instances, people will go out
and drop $10K for a high end software licence, $25K for a new
oscilliscope, $75K for a high speed digital camera, or even $250K for
a 24-CPU supermini...all without worrying if they can &quot;economize&quot; by
still do their email on the same box.

Welcome to the &quot;better is the enemy of good enough&quot; dilemma.

Simplistically, for a general purpose desktop, you are claiming that
you want the system that can run the most software, thus you have to
have the system that can run the most OS's, so that you eliminate any
OS-related constraints on your software choices.  Essentially, this
means that your requirement is that you need hardware that runs both
OS X and Windows (and Linux, etc).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Going with Windows instead of a Mac is almost a no-brainer in that
&gt; situation. Can anything be *done* about that?
">

Are you sure?  Going with Windows only belies that you've made the
assumption that you've made is that you've denied any possibility of
some software application that is offered on OS X but not on Windows,
so therefore you can choose to constrain your OS's.  Why did you make
this assumption?

FWIW, one example of an OS X only software application is Aperture.

While there are similar image-handling applications (such as
Lightroom), becuase you appear to be artificially constrained your OS
choices to Windows-only, you are denying yourself the ability to even
consider this program, which, for whatever reason, you may decide is
critically different than &quot;similar&quot; programs that exist on other
OS's.

Because Apple's Intel Macs now officially supports running Windows
(Bootcamp), but generic Windows hardware doesn't as adequately support
running OS X, by this 'best chance' criterion, I don't see how you're
not saying that you must buy the hardware that can run more OS's
adequately, which means the Macintosh.
