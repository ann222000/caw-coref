*Red Squadron Weekly Report #11 – **12/17/2007***

* *

Greetings everyone, this is MAJ Cray Mikalen bringing you another weekly
report. This report covers the week ending December 16th, 2007. I apologize
for the delay in releasing this report. The last couple of days have been
extremely... unusual for me.

*Squadron News:*

-MAJ Gen Es'mith has been named the new WC of Wing XXI! Congrats!

-MAJ Cray Mikalen was awarded the Bronze Star for November activity!

-The holidays have slowed things down considerably for everyone, myself
included. Look for a squadron competition to begin later this week.

-Everyone go take the IWATS Trillian Course! I hear the professor is a
genius, and very good looking.

-Check out http://www.ehtiecorps.org for the latest TIE Corps news!

*Squadron Status and Orders:*

-Red Squadron remains very slow activity wise. It's the holiday season for
many of us, however I hope everyone tries to get in a mission or two if they
can.

-Our number of squadron citations dropped considerably when CM Gistenjunge
left for the reserves. Everyone try to fly some battles and help bring this
number back up!

*-REPORT IN ONCE A WEEK!!! *There are currently a couple pilots that have
not reported in for some time now. Everyone needs to report in once a week.
The minimum you must do to avoid getting AWOL'ed is once per month, but I
think we can all find the time to send a simple email once per week. I just
need a weekly update on your status so I know you're still alive. If you're
too busy to do anything else, then just tell me that.

*Competitions and Events:*

-The Recon Officer, HA Frodo March, has launched a youtube competition!
Basically, the person who makes the best recruiting video for youtube will
win a IS-PR, with awards for 2nd and 3rd place as well. Also, the first
video to reach 1,000 views by March, 2008 will receive an IS-GR as well!
This sounds like a very interesting competition, and has the added benefit
of helping recruit more pilots for the Emperor's Hammer!

*Multiplayer Showcase:*

underway! This competition lasts the entire month, and the pilot with the
most MP points at the end of the month will win an IS-GW.

*Final Thoughts:*

First off, congrats to MAJ Gen on his promotion to Wing Commander. He's an
old hand at commanding units in the TIE Corps, and I know between him and RA
Gunman, we've got the best command team in the fleet. And no, I'm not trying
to suck up to the bosses. J As far as Red Squadron goes, it's been another
very slow week. It's the holiday season for many around the world, and I
know first hand how much time that can suck out of your day. However, I'm
hoping to see a little life surge up from the abyss of quiet that we've
experienced lately. I'll be launching a couple different squadron
competitions as the week progresses. Also, there are some interesting things
going on throughout the fleet, especially the RO's youtube competition. The
positive effect this could have on recruiting could be phenomenal for the
fleet, so I encourage everyone with the skills to check it out. Finally,
remember to email me once a week, and if you have any interesting thoughts
on events, how to improve the squad, etc, please let me know. I'm always
open to new ideas and suggestions.

Respectfully Submitted,

Major Cray Mikalen

Red Squadron CMDR
