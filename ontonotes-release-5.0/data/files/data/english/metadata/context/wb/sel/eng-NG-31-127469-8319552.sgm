&quot;BEHOLD&quot;

A rainbow in the sky
Behold
It is an angel stopping by
Sent by a heavenly guy
I'm in amazement; on a high
A beautiful act of nature
A divine allure

August 10th - St. Lawrence (Laurence) of Rome, Martyr

Born in Huesca (?), Spain; died in Rome, Italy, 258. Lawrence was said to be a
Spaniard who came to Rome to serve Pope Saint Sixtus II as one of the seven
deacons of Rome. The pope himself was martyred in 258 during the Valerian
persecution, the year after the first publication of the decrees against the
Christians. While one version of the martyrdom of Sixtus has him beheaded at the
time of discovery in the catacombs, the another has him taken away for
questioning and returned within a few hours to the spot for execution. In either
case, several early Christian writers, among them Saints Ambrose and Prudentius,
record that Lawrence was overwhelmed with grief when Sixtus was condemned.

The latter one tells us that Lawrence followed the pope and his captors to the
place of execution, asking why Sixtus II should be murdered and not his deacon
(however, six deacons were martyred with Sixtus). Sixtus replied, &quot;My son, I am
not leaving you. In a few days you will follow me.&quot;

Lawrence, overjoyed that he was to follow his master to martyrdom, had one task
left. As a deacon, Lawrence was a steward of the property and wealth of the
church. It was his duty to provide alms to those in need. Lawrence gathered
together all the poor, the orphans, and the widows he could find and gave them
all he possessed. Lawrence even sold some of the church's gold and silver,
handing over this money too to the needy.

The prefect, Cornelius Saecularis, believing that the Church was wealthy,
ordered that everything of value be turned over to the emperor for the upkeep of
his armies. The prefect said, &quot;I understand that according to your teaching you
must render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's. Your God didn't bring any
money into the world with him, all He brought was words. So give us the money,
and you can keep the words.&quot;

Lawrence said he would need three days to gather it together. In those three
days he sold the rest of the property that he administered and brought together
thousands of lepers, the blind, and the sick, the destitute, widows, orphans,
and the aged. These he presented to the prefect, observing, &quot;The church is truly
rich, far richer then your emperor.&quot;

In his rage the prefect threatened to kill Lawrence slowly. He took a huge
gridiron, heated it until it glowed, and binding Lawrence to the metal, roasted
him to death. Ambrose tells us that the fire of Divine love burned so brightly
in Lawrence that he bore the agony with unbelievable calm and in the midst of
his torment instructed the executioner to turn him over, as he was broiled
enough on the one side. Later he said, &quot;It is cooked enough. You may eat.&quot; It is
said that as he lay dying, his face seemed to be surrounded by a beautiful
light. After praying for the conversion of Rome, he died.

According to Prudentius, his death and example led to the conversion of Rome and
signaled the end of paganism in the city. There is no doubt that his death
inspired a great devotion in Rome, which quickly spread throughout the entire
Church. Both he and Sixtus are named in the canon of the Mass.

The existence and martyrdom of Saint Lawrence are attested by the very ancient
Deposito Martyrum. However, scholars are not wholly in agreement about how much
credence can be given to such particulars about Saint Lawrence because his
passio was not written until at least a century after his death. The fact of his
martyrdom was widely accepted by the Fathers, but there is room to doubt the
details. For example, it is more likely that he was beheaded, as was Sixtus,
because this was the usual manner of execution at that time. The gridiron
appears to be derived from a Phrygian source through the acta of Saint Vincent
of Saragossa.

He was buried in the cemetery of Cyriaca in the Campo Verano on the Via
Tiburtina (on the way to Tivoli), on the site of what is now the Church of Saint
Lawrence-outside-the-Walls. Five ancient churches are dedicated to Lawrence in
Rome, 228 were dedicated to him in England prior to the Reformation, as well as
the cathedral of Lund and the Escorial in Spain. Pope Vitalian sent some of his
relics to King Oswy of Northumbria in the 7th century. Lawrence's intercession
was reputed to have caused the victories of Christian armies in the battle of
Lichfeld against the Magyars in 955, and at Saint-Quentin, in 1557 (Attwater,
Benedictines, Bentley, Delaney, Encyclopedia, Farmer, White).

Generally, he is pictured as a deacon with a gridiron, or giving money to the
poor [Pope Sixtus II or greeted by him on his way to martyrdom; (3) putting a
chalice on Saint Michael's scales to save the Emperor's life; (4) leading a soul
from purgatory (which he is reputed to do every Friday); (5) baptizing in
prison; (6) scourged and roasted on gridiron (Roeder); or (7) carrying a long
cross on his shoulder and a Gospel book in his hand as in the Ravenna mosaics
(White). The most complete cycle of his life was painted by Bl. Fra Angelico for
the chapel of Nicholas V in the Vatican. These include Saint Lawrence Receiving
the Treasures of the Church, The Ordination of Saint Lawrence, and Saint
Lawrence in Justice and his Martyrdom. Bourges and Poitiers has notable stained
glass windows depicting Lawrence (Farmer).

He was one of the most popular and powerful saints of the Middle Ages, which
accounts for his many patronages. He is the patron of deacons (Farmer),
schoolboys, students, armorers, brewers, confectioners, cooks (what did you
expect-he was roasted ), cutlers, glaziers, and launderers (Roeder).

Saint Quote:
has lost and who has won in the struggle-the one who keeps the premises
[buildings] or the one who keeps the Faith?  The Faith obviously. That therefore
the ordinances which have been preserved in the churches from old time until now
may not be lost in our days,... rouse yourselves, brethren,... seeing them now
seized upon by aliens.
-St. Basil the Great  (ca. 330-ca. 379)

Bible Quote
19. Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove
from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
(Matthew 17:19)

PRAYER FOR PROTECTION AGAINST DEMONS

O Mary, powerful Virgin,
You are the mighty and glorious Protector of the Church.
You are the Marvelous Help of Christians.
You are Terrible as an Army set in Battle Array.
You alone have destroyed every heresy in the entire Church.
In the midst of my anguish, my struggles and my distress,
Defend me from the power of the enemy,
And at the hour of my death,
Receive my soul into Paradise.

(Saint John Bosco, C. 1880)
