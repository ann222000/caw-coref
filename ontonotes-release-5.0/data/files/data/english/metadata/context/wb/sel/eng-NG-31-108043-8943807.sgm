I was just looking through my characters folder today and I've gotten
kind of nostalgic for all these characters I'll probably never play now
that 4E's coming out.

So lets share characters we wanted to play at one time but never got
around to it (or never got around to playing them to your satisfaction).

My first 3E character was a spirit folk martial artist/shaman/blade
dancer, looking for his ranger/shugenja/witch hunter friend which went
missing while looking for an evil monk/tattooed monk (planning to take
Leadership once he found her). The first session, the DM got annoyed
with another player and TPK-ed us to prove a point. Jackass.

I have a gnome bard 11/paladin 2 with Devoted Pefromer and Arcane Strike
and a wand of divine power. Imagine saying &quot;I'm a gnome bard!&quot; and then
charging into melee to Arcane Strike Power Attack smite someone for
massive damage!

Sister Ariana was a longsword-wielding cleric 6/monk 1, going for
loremaster. Another wuxia wandering swordsman type, and another
character where a big part of the appeal is surprising those who
underestimate you based on your appearance and the fact that you took
Skill Focus in a knowledge.

Togashi Toshi was a Tamori yamabushi in a Rokugan campaign that lasted
for just a session or two. I used a &quot;battle shugenja&quot;: UA battle
sorcerer tweaks applied to a shugenja rather than a sorcerer. A nother
sort of wuxia type: I took Versatile from rokugan to get jump and tumble
as class skills, and Leap of the Heavens, Acrobatic Strike and Leap
Attack. He was one of the most satisfying warrior-mages I played.

There's also a rogue/cleric/shadowbane stalker with a mercurial
greatsword, a Mercykiller for a Planescape game. Think Severian meets
Dark Justice guy. A nice, quiet kind of guy... unless you're GUILTY, in
which case he's the masked, black-plated, black-cloaked figure you see
with the corner of your eye just before the executioner's sword comes
arcing down.

So, what about yours?

Hmm...  there was a cleric, born third son of a merchant family in
Greyhawk.  He became disillusioned with the worship of Zilchus (god of
money), and turned to being a worshipper of truth and self-employed
vigilante who introduces himself only as the Grey Man.

There was Marnak (&quot;Names are unimportant, but you can call me Marnak.
Everyone else does, after all.&quot;); a swashbuckler, scoundrel and self-
aggrandising popinjay.

There was Pierrick, a woodsman and ranger from a PbP game that lasted
about 5 posts before the DM got bored and vanished.

I find that I tend to create a character for a setting, and very much
go by the &quot;method acting&quot; style for most games.  Of course, if it's a
dungeon-crawl game, I'll put together something like a Goliath
Warblade (that would have been a fun one!).  That particular game
never got off the ground when the DM was banned from the PbP site!

It was.  This was a sort of &quot;special occasion&quot; game, where a bunch of us
(from the Sacramento area) were traveling to the Bay Area to play with old
friends from that area that do not play often.  I was expecting the party to
be more or less &quot;standard race/class&quot; D&amp;D, but it ended up being a bit of a
menagerie of weirdness.  For one, I figured I was going to be the &quot;token big
guy tank.&quot;  Turns out we had two.  Here is the party break down (everyone is
1st level, being played for the first time, and male unless noted):

Goliath Warblade (Goliath Greathammer) - described a bit above
Half-Ogre Fighter (Large Greataxe) - typical &quot;big dumb fighter&quot;
Tiefling Wizard - played like a somewhat perverted, effeminate used car
salesman
Halfling Rogue (female, played before) - a typical &quot;thief&quot; character,
avoiding combat as much as possible, and trying to sneak loot without anyone
finding out
Human Cleric of Wee Jas - played a little too &quot;over the top&quot; evil, 2nd level
Aasimar Monk (Vow of Poverty) - high AC build, slightly paladin-like
attitude
Aasimar Spirit Shaman - player was pretty quiet
Aasimar Cleric of Pelor - future Radiant Servant, player was pretty quiet

The plot was a infiltration into a Hobgoblin slave camp (the slavers were
associated with Iuz).  The Wizard and the two tanks were a slaver and two
bodyguards, respectively, and the rest were posing as slaves, but had
daggers enchanted to be invisible for a few days, or until used.  The real
slaves were to banged up and demoralized to be of much use.  There was a lot
of fun with the roleplaying, especially with the low Charisma Wizard running
the show (he decided that his low Charisma was due to him having a creepy,
slimy personality).  He haggled over the price of the slaves he was selling,
claiming that since he had &quot;sweet, juicy celestials,&quot; he should get double
what they were offering.  My Goliath got to save the Half-Ogre's life ealier
in the adventure, and I reminded him of our 1-0 score for the rest of the
game, which got some laughs.  We also had intra-party violence twice.  The
Wizard cast Burning Hands on the Rogue, because she stole his pack with all
his money (it was so heavy that the encumbrance penalty messed up her
theft).  That made his point, and she gave up.  The Cleric of Wee Jas, for
some inexplicable reason, decided to kill one of the slaves &quot;as a
distraction,&quot; and was caught by the Monk, who proceded to beat him
unconscious, and hand him over to the elves at the end of the adventure.

Actually it was more of an army of orcs, with ogre sergeants. I may be

I've spent the lion's share of my gaming life as a GM, so I've got a
lot of characters in my head, but few that have made it to paper, much
less actual play. Rather than thinking in terms of classes, these are
more archetypes and concepts:

There's a many-ribboned Genki Girl monk named Unspeakable Joy floating
around in my head that I'll write up at the first threat of a game,
although probably not for a long, dramatic campaign. I'd never
maintain the pace.

I have a thing for angsty fallen-knight types. Leon Ermenegilde
Bartelemy de Boniface was once the heir to a duchy, until the onset of
leprosy and his scheming brother combined to take away his birthright
and cast him into the waiting arms of the Ordo Vitualamen, sort of a
St. Lazarus type of thing for the diseased, bastard scions, and
outcasts. I write about this guy on occasion, and I'd love to play him
as a PC.

Remember all that Battle Nun stuff?  I've always wanted to play a
female paladin, cleric, or ascetic fighter based on the nun concept,
perhaps as a holy warrior, inquisitor or exorcist, depending on the
game.

There are more, but that's all I got right now.

Fair enough.  I thought I'd extend a specific invitation in case you
were.

If I end up with players from the newsgroup (I know my 'definite player'
skims here from time to time) I may end up limiting 'secret stuff' I'm
willing to post publicly, at least until after it happens in-game.
Would you be available for me to bounce stuff off, if I can't do it in

Thought of more:

Jakari, a barbarian tribeswoman turned gladiator turned pirate
captain. She was an NPC in a campaign some years back, and lots of fun
to play, especially when she became attracted to one of the PCs, who
was exactly the same kind of hard-boiled survivor that she was.

Kleig, a firbolg that left his clan to find a way to lift a curse that
is slowly turning the other firbolgs into trees. This guy dates back
to the 2e Humanoids Handbook, when I was trying to think of a reason
why a reclusive giant-kin would be out adventuring. He was scared to
death of humans due to &quot;giant-killer&quot; stories he'd heard as a boy (re-
cast as lessons in good behavior for young giants - &quot;Mind ye manners,
boy, or Tiny Jack will come through the floor and cut off your toes
while you sleep!&quot;). He had nightmares about humans' little hands,
little teeth, and shrill little voices.

Fizgug, a mongrelfolk rogue that I actually played for a while in a 2e
Ravenloft campaign.  Always wanted to update him for 3.x and have
another go. He was raised as an &quot;Igor-esque&quot; slave to an evil wizard
who ended up getting killed by noble adventurer types, forcing Fizgug
to make his own way in the world. Very resourceful and clever, but
uncomfortable with independence, he kept latching on to other PCs as
his new &quot;masters.&quot;

We currently have party conflict but not violence.

Our previous homegame group sorta did though not with PC directly. I was
a paladin of Pelor and another player had a custom PrC &quot;good&quot;
necromancer who would summon &quot;happy, helpful&quot; zombies that my warhorse
and I would kill on sight. If there was a battle, I'd focus on the enemy
first (because these zombies weren't a direct threat to the party) but
at the first available round they would get stomped on or turned/slain.

It genuinely irked the player every time. I don't know why he was
thinking it would go otherwise. We were later joined by a cleric of
Pelor who joined in the fun. The rest of the group and I had many laughs
with this. Usually I prefer to play in groups where we can all get
along.  :)

Some of our games are more normal than others.  Some start normal, but get
weird.  For example, the next session will feature an Elven Druid, an Elven
Fighter, a Human Mystic Theurge of Boccob, a Human Bard, and a Gnome Rogue.
Of course, it will also feature a Xeph Psychic Warrior/Scout/Elocater, a
Whisper Gnome Warlock, a Pseudonatural Half-Orc Barbarian/Warblade, and a
Fetch-templated Human Paladin/Cleric/Crusader of Wee Jas.  The Pseudonatural
and Fetch stuff happened in play.
