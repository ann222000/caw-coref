Is it just me or are the old school, &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; bike shops fading
away due to places like walmart,target, and performance?

They (the above mentioned) started out small and like any hungry group
of biz-ness folk ,they grew their business &amp; good for them. But
durring their quest for retail domination, they are intentionally or
otherwise erasing a part of American tradition-The friendly
neighborhood bike shop.

Like myself, I'm sure their are many of you that stay true to your
local shop. So my question is this...What makes you stay loyal and why
are the big guys killing the local shop?

I personally have found the service from the lnbs to be more
aproachable, more casual, and way more informative. I have also found
some bitchin' old school memorabillia (like my 1951 5spd topetube
stick shift Peugeot) from my lnbs. Not to mention the shop dog's. I
love those dog's almost as much as my own k-9's. Seriously people, how
can you not like a shop dog. You know what I mean.? Anyway.
The turn around time for a service is eaqual to if not sooner than the
big guy's. The accessory prices are usually the same or lower than the
big guy's, and the quality of the bike's are way better. (I'm sorry
but the Schwinn at walmat or target is not the same Schwinn you will
get from your lnbs).

So again I ponder this sleepless question, why are the big guy's
doing so well and the local guys struggling?

Can someone please show me what I'm missing here?

I think it's pretty simple. Most people think of bikes as toys for
children. And those same people figure why spend a lot of money on a
bike for a child when they will outgrow it in just a couple of years.

I don't know that they're fading away, but it amazes me that they can
stay in business.

On the one hand, casual buyers or parents buying for kids will go to
the department stores for to save money. And &quot;serious&quot; cyclists will
go to the large &quot;pro&quot; shops that carry mid to high-end bikes.

Guys like me, just keep riding their old bikes, maintaining them at
home, and buying parts through mail order or ebay.

The small shop has to offer service that the depatment stores can't if
they want to survive. I know of a few small shops that have a good
following among recreational cyclists and even racers, as well as
selling childrens bikes. It's a delicate balancing act, and I don't
think they're getting rich.

Not around here.  There are probably half a dozen independent
bike shops along or near my 6 mile daily commute route.

I'm not so sure that things are the way they seem. I rarely see a bike
leaving my local Target store. My LBS opened a second store a couple of
years ago and it was slow there for a while, but now I won't go near the
place to buy parts on the weekends since most of the parts I want are
special order. They are just too busy selling bikes or people are
picking them up. If I go during standard working hours, M-F, I will get
much better service.

I don't stay true to *any* particular business. A business needs to
earn my patronage with each and every sale. I recently fired one of my
LBS because they were helpful and timely only in the off season. In
the summer, they wanted me to wait too long for even simple repairs.
And with a bad attitude to boot.

It is not just bikes. Any small business who is competing with the big
box stores cannot try to compete simply on a price basis, because the
small guy will certainly lose. The small business needs to find a
niche, and focus on that target customer. And repeat customers are the
key, because a business will not grow without them.

Running a small business has never been an easy way to earn a living.
Now with the big box stores and the Internet as competitors, it is
even more difficult to turn a profit.

Schumpeter covered this very well, starting about a hundred years ago.

If there's no risk of failure, then achievement, innovation and
development suffers. Imagine if no business ever failed. Your downtown
would be filled with vendors of buggy whips and lamp oil, perhaps a
farrier or two. No room for wireless services!
Businesses which change to meet their customers' demands/ tastes/
frivolities survive. Others don't. Where we fail to serve our customers,
XMart sees opportunity. Thus was it ever.

I recently visited Pittsburgh, PA where I grew up. There used to be at
least one LBS in every neighborhood. When I looked in the yellow pages
phone book there were only about a dozen shops listed in the whole
metropolitan area.

In the SF Bay Area where I live now there are LBS in just about every
community.

The small neighborhood mom &amp; pops LBS will probably fade away in favor of
more specialized shops.

Another thing, how many soccer mom's are involved in cycling? Point being,
there are a lot of other activities that can compete with bicycles for
kids leisure time.

Today a lot of LBS are in close proximity to college campuses. Weather can
also contribute to the amount of cycling interest in a community. In much
of the US cycling is a 6 month a year activity for most casual riders.

Add to the above issues, mail order and internet businesses take away a
good portion of the profitable component and accessory business.

The advantage that LBS offer is that you can have it now rather than
waiting for 2-10+ days to receive the parts that you want.

Yep, big boxes and the interweb certainly played their parts.

I'm sure that Walmart's bulk ordering power gives them a nifty price
break that the M&amp;Ps would not enjoy. Even if a small shop was to
compete with big box prices, nobody brings their bike back to Walmart
expecting to have it repaired by the &quot;Sports Section&quot; bozo they bought
it from. Different story for M&amp;P's, who are expected to cater to the
purchaser's every whim. That means paid man hours spent on frustrating
adjustments of disposeable parts (or costly replacements) rather than
selling bikes (or hula hoops, or nerf footballs, or....)

As for the web, I'm certainly guilty there. But my local shop just
isn't going to stock every single part I'm looking for, especially at
the price I'm able to find it at. (In ways, however, the net has
helped shops when people order, say, a bottom bracket, but don't know
how to install it or don't have the tools.)

One other factor is the brands themselves. A lot of old mom and pop
stores were Schwinn dealers. Ever since Pacific bought them out and
introduced them to the big box stores, Schwinn lost nearly all of
their credibility, the perception being,  &quot;Why pay extra at a bike
shop for the same brand?&quot; That's why you won't find them in many M&amp;Ps,
nor the M&amp;Ps themselves. I, for one, haven't seen a new Schwinn in a
bike shop since... 1999? They must be out there, because I see the
advertised in the mags, but I don't see them on the road. Anyway, back
to the point, as in most other consumables, people buy based on:
1. the color
2. the familiarity of the name on the sticker affixed to the object
Show most of these people a classic Paramount next to a Walmart $199
dual suspension chrome Schwinn, and they'll take the latter.

I often special order through my LBS. I figure out what I want from the

wash, so why not let the LBS get the sale? I can usually figure out what

Well we still have plenty of neighborhood bike shops where I am, both
friendly and unfriendly, though tending toward the latter unfortunately.
The selection at these shops has been getting worse and worse as they
drop product lines. Two shops in my area recently changed owners, and
the decrease in product selection was very noticeable.

One of the biggest issues with the smaller shops is their opening hours.
When people got out of work at 5:00, 10-6 may have worked fine. These
days it doesn't. Performance and REI are open until 9:00 p.m, on
weeknights, and are open Sunday, while a lot of small shops close at
6:00 or 7:00 p.m. and close completely on Sunday. Just for myself, twice
I've helped relatives shop for bikes, and the reason they went to
Performance is because they were open. The buyers' weren't picky, they
needed a certain style of bike, and they wanted to get it right away.

The population of Pittsburgh, PA was ~619,000 in 1970. Today it's 339,000.

Three or four generations have moved away from rust belt towns like
Pittsburgh.

The successful bike shops seem to be the ones that specialize in upscale
bikes. They generally don't have to compete with big box business with
these kinds of bikes.

I like to support my LBSs. I check with them first and unless something is
priced way out of line I will pay 5% to 20% more just for the convenience
of having a LBS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So my question is this...What makes you stay loyal and why
&gt;are the big guys killing the local shop?

&gt;I personally have found the service from the lnbs to be more
&gt;aproachable
">

One factor could be liquidity.   I've found some small shops
extremely difficult to deal with on returns/warranty issues.

My guess is that money is tight with them and they just can't
afford to be too accommodating.   Bigger shops... more money...

OTOH there's also a lot riding on the manager/owner.

I find one LBS's owner tb extremely hard-nosed.   I guess he's
gotta be to survive, but I gravitated to the local Performance
shop after dealing with him a couple of times.

But manager of the local Performance shop quit some months ago
and, as far as I can see, the soul has gone out of the place.

That guy would do anything for a customer.

Now it's just a bunch of people punching the clock.   Went in
there a few weeks ago to order a Gravity Dropper seatpost. Found
it in the catalog, asked the guy &quot;How much?&quot;.   Guy said &quot;Dunno&quot;.
I said &quot;How about finding out?&quot;  Guy said &quot;We only call orders in
on Mondays.   We'll find out then.&quot;

So I went home and bought it online from PricePoint... probably
significantly cheaper.... and haven't looked back.

If I need something locally, there's a good chance I'll start
going back to the LBS - hard-nosed or not.

Back in late August I tried to buy a set of CX tires locally (within 20
miles).  I called 3 LBS's...LBS#1- Sorry, no CX tires in stock, they're
&quot;not in season&quot; yet. Thank You, &quot;click&quot;     LBS#2-  I don't think we
sell &quot;that&quot; brand. Thank You, &quot;click&quot;    LBS#3 - Yep. I have one 29'er
in stock, a Panaracer,,, I think. Thank You, &quot;click&quot;

I then called a shop 90 miles away.  They stocked several brands with a
fine selection in treads and widths.  I called to more shops in the
general region and they too had similar selections to offer.

To quote Tip O'Neil, &quot;all politics are local&quot;,  I'm learning that these
days, regardless the endeavor, customer service is as well.   While I
live within 20 miles of city with a population of over 150,000,  I
routinely need to shop in other, often smaller and more distant
communities with businesses that meet my expectations.

Having formally been in the retail/service sector,  I'm  very aware of
the daily challenges that a small entrepreneur faces.   I must admit
however,  I'm  growing increasingly weary of trying to support local
&quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; operations that can't even compete amongst themselves.

Totally off topic, but I was riding up the coast of California many
years ago and was approaching Fort Bragg -- which had a funky little
shop in a quonset hut with very irregular hours (closed on Sunday and
Monday, IIRC).  It was Saturday.  I ran in to a couple of guys whose
tires were being held together with duct tape (no kidding) who had to
get to the shop and buy tires so they could continue on their tour.
They got there just after it closed.  I think they had to hang around
for two days.  I had a problem like that later in Astoria, Oregon, but
I woke up the owner (who lived over the store) and made him sell me a
set of pedals so I could get on my way (stupid me, I had some ER Ti
pedals on a touring bike and broke a spindle). I guess the moral of
the story is that if you really want time off, don't live over your
store. -- Jay Beattie.

I was just thinking the same thing. Look at the Chinese-owned stores and
they stay open as long hours as possible, often to the limit of what the
city where they are located allows. Then again, these are usually
family-owned stores, where the non-core hour staff consists of unpaid

I found one semi mom and pop chain that has two stores near me and is
about as non-pro shop as you can find.

Four times I've gone in there and found what I was looking for (twice in
stock, once they immediately offered to get it for me in a couple of
days). In one instance it was 24&quot; road tires for my son's bicycle. I
don't think any shop stocks them, but Specialized makes them and any
Specialized dealer can order them if they really want to. In another
instance it was a Snell-approved helmet, which are relatively hard to
find but again this shop had some from Specialized, at a very good
price. A third time was for a rear rack from Jandd, that I was sure that
no one would have, but they had it (I ended up not buying it because it
lacked a reflector bracket). In another instance, it was side-entry
water bottle cage for a bicycle with a frame that could not work with a
regular cage. In each case, the shops closer to me did not have the item
and had no interest in trying to get it. To them, someone spending $40
on some tires, or $40 on a helmet, or $80 on a rack, is not someone
worth worrying about.

I too have become weary trying to go to the poorly stocked shops. If
Performance, REI, or Off Ramp doesn't have it, then I order it on-line.

I think that the small shops aren't even all that interested in selling
accessories. While the margins are higher than on complete bikes, there
is just too much involved in keeping up the inventory for relatively low
priced stuff.

Presumably these shops have evaluated the cost of staying open on Sunday
versus the amount of business they lose, and have decided that it's more
profitable to close on Sunday. Perhaps they're not concerned about how
much they lose by closing Sunday. Perhaps they are closed for religious
reasons, just as the Orthodox Jewish-owned camera stores in NYC close on
Saturday.

In any case, there are enough shops that are open on Sunday to take up

Labor regulations are quite different for family members, not that there
haven't been substantial abuses of labor laws by various businesses in the
past. In California, it's very, very expensive to remain open more than 8
hours/day due to the present overtime rules. If employees were allowed to
work a 10 hour shift 4 days/week at standard pay, the world would be a very
different place for many small businesses. But as things stand, we cannot
afford to pay overtime to stay open late, even though many of our employees
would very much enjoy a 4-day workweek.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not quite. If you don't have adequate staffing in the evening hours or on a
weekend, you run a very high risk of robbery &amp; shop lifting. Plus it's
impossible, even after doing this for 29 years, to know when the customers
are going to show up. When it's quiet, we often joke that the customers are
massing in the parking lot, getting ready for their next attack.

And, of course, there's the balancing act of business vs family. These days,
most small businesses don't survive without some degree of subsidization
from the family. That comes in many forms; sometimes family members working
at the business (guilty), sometimes meaning that the owner works a
ridiculous number of hours (guilty), sometimes meaning that, during leaner
months, the owner finances the business him/herself via credit lines on
their homes (also guilty).

With that as a backdrop, you can see the reasons why I have drawn the line
at being open only six days a week, 8 hours a day. I'm not saying that,
strictly from a business standpoint, you're not absolutely 100% correct in
suggesting that Chain Reaction Bicycles would be better off open the same
hours as Performance. But as long as it's my business, that won't happen,
because I'm the weak link in the chain that can't properly pull it off. If I
could, I'd be running a very different type of business, for good &amp; bad.

Andy's the extreme, as you can tell from his infamous tagline- &quot;Open every
day since 1 April, 1971.&quot; I don't know how he does it, nor even why.
Obviously it works well for him. And so far he's survived maybe 10 years
longer than I have.

Assuming that you're paying more than minimum wage, if the employees
really wanted a 4 day work week they would agree to hourly wage
adjustments that would keep their take home pay the same, i.e. the
average hourly rate would be the same, but it would be slightly lower
for the first eight hours, and much higher for the second two hours due
to overtime time and a half.

In any case, I think that opening six days a week is sufficient, as long
as the seventh day is not Saturday or Sunday. But that's solely from a
customer's point of view, I understand why family time on weekends is
necessary.

&gt;&gt; city where they are located allows. Then again, these are usually
&gt;&gt; family-owned stores, where the non-core hour staff consists of unpaid
&gt;&gt; family members.

&gt; Not quite. If you don't have adequate staffing in the evening hours or on a

&gt; are going to show up. When it's quiet, we often joke that the customers are

&gt; And, of course, there's the balancing act of business vs family. These days,
&gt; most small businesses don't survive without some degree of subsidization
&gt; from the family. That comes in many forms; sometimes family members working
&gt; at the business (guilty), sometimes meaning that the owner works a
&gt; ridiculous number of hours (guilty), sometimes meaning that, during leaner
&gt; months, the owner finances the business him/herself via credit lines on
&gt; their homes (also guilty).
&gt; With that as a backdrop, you can see the reasons why I have drawn the line
&gt; at being open only six days a week, 8 hours a day. I'm not saying that,
&gt; strictly from a business standpoint, you're not absolutely 100% correct in
&gt; suggesting that Chain Reaction Bicycles would be better off open the same
&gt; hours as Performance. But as long as it's my business, that won't happen,
&gt; because I'm the weak link in the chain that can't properly pull it off. If I
&gt; could, I'd be running a very different type of business, for good &amp; bad.
&gt; Andy's the extreme, as you can tell from his infamous tagline- &quot;Open every
&gt; day since 1 April, 1971.&quot; I don't know how he does it, nor even why.
&gt; Obviously it works well for him. And so far he's survived maybe 10 years
&gt; longer than I have.

Not to mention that Mike's 'open hours' are probably not the actual
hours he works. If his is a typical small business, add another 25~50%
before and after 'open hours'.

walmart, target, and performance cut out the middle-man overhead.  In
many cases performance can sell some products more cheaply than your
LBS can order them at wholesale price (quote from LBS owner.)

Since the purchase of bike nashbar and supergo, performance now has

High-cost distributors are strangling the LBS business model.

The chance that I find a &quot;bobish&quot; item (practical, affordable,
durable, time-tested) at my local LBS is about 0.001%.  The last thing
I found was Avenir/Minoura/Raleigh stainless bottle cages - a $4.50
item selling at the horrific price of $12.99 each.

These places are too busy showing off their latest XTR grouppos where
everything looks like an &quot;X&quot;, and all the $120 carbon seatposts,
whereas I find the $12 aluminum seatposts hold the saddle just as well...

Anything useful i must mail-order it through the LBS.  If they force
me to mail order it through them, why not cut out the middle-man
(which is them) and mail-order it directly, where I can browse the
catalogue at home, rather than going through their QBP phonebook which
is mostly junk ??

That's pretty much the way I approach it. For me, mail order is
inconvenient. I'm not home during delivery hours so I invariably have to
pick the package up at the shipping company's depot. That's two miles
away for UPS, 40 miles away for FedEx, and 75 miles away for DHL.
Unfortunately most mail order outfits either ship FedEx or don't tell
you what carrier they're going to use until the order ships. Pretty much
all of my mail order purchases are from smaller shops that either ship
UPS as a rule or give me a choice (Harris, Peter White) and those don't
offer a price advantage over the LBS.

Only for hourly workers, but there are many requirements for &quot;exempt&quot; status
that a service-oriented business cannot meet. Doesn't matter, some do claim
exempt status for non-management employees, and when they get caught, it can
be very bad. As it should be. There are rules laid down regarding working
conditions, and those rules are there by &amp; large for good reason. With the
possible exception, of course, of the impossibility of a 4-day work week
without it involving overtime.

That gets really weird. In principle, yes, it makes sense. In practice, it's

similar positions, not working a 4 day week, and getting paid more per

Most small businesses are, as I pointed out, subsidized by owners who spend
far too much time working, basically covering up for their various
management deficiences and the inherently unforgiving nature of running a
small business. There are so many ways things can go wrong, and so little
cushion to fall back upon. But nevertheless it is a problem of *mine* that I
have a difficult time being away from the business when the doors are open.
I admit that things might be better otherwise.

To some extent it depends upon your location. Our Los Altos store is open
both Saturdays and Sundays, but closed on Mondays. So between the two
stores, you *can* get to us 7 days/week. We chose the Los Altos store to be
open Sundays due to its location in a shopping center, while our Redwood
City location has very little drop-in traffic, and when we have been open on
Sundays, there's not too much interest. Not even many phone calls come in
(open or not, despite the fact that most people calling on the phone
wouldn't know that we'd be closed on a Sunday).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which is why Saturdays are so much busier than Sundays. You buy the bike, or

The only thing I can guarantee, after all these years, is that things get
extremely busy on a Saturday at 2:15pm, +/- 3 minutes. It's bizarre. But
yes, I have the data, by hour, by day of week, everything. And I do try and

Only in an environment in which every single employee is treated the same.
You can't have people doing the same or similar jobs and being paid
substantially different wages/hour without running into trouble. So if

My local bike shop is growing and recently opened a branch store in
another city.

They have always specialized in selling high-end bicycles though, in
the last five years, and especially the last two years, the definition
of high-end has rapidly changed to the point where the bike shop owner
no longer understands the vast majority of what she has in stock and
all the mechanics have far nicer bikes than she does.

Even within China it is uncommon for a real bike shop to be owned by
someone who isn't a cyclist and with the exception of the local bike
shop there is no one else in the country at her absolute stellar level
of quality where the boss doesn't ride.  (I'd say she probably does in
a month what any one of the racers does on a single training ride.)

My brother used to own The Spokesman in Santa Cruz, Cal.
In spite of the fact that there's a lot of competition in
that town, this store did quite well. But, my brother
got tired of the hassle of being in a retail business
so he sold out and tried selling real estate. It turned
out that selling real estate was even more of a hassle
than being in retail so now he's opened up another
bike store, this time in Watsonville, Cal.

Maybe this kind of thing is the reason why other
neighborhood bike stops are fading away.

&gt; Is it just me or are the old school, &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; bike shops fading
&gt; away due to places like walmart,target, and performance?

&gt; They (the above mentioned) started out small and like any hungry group
&gt; of biz-ness folk ,they grew their business &amp; good for them. But
&gt; durring their quest for retail domination, they are intentionally or
&gt; otherwise erasing a part of American tradition-The friendly
&gt; neighborhood bike shop.

&gt; Like myself, I'm sure their are many of you that stay true to your
&gt; local shop. So my question is this...What makes you stay loyal and why
&gt; are the big guys killing the local shop?

&gt; I personally have found the service from the lnbs to be more
&gt; aproachable, more casual, and way more informative. I have also found
&gt; some bitchin' old school memorabillia (like my 1951 5spd topetube
&gt; stick shift Peugeot) from my lnbs. Not to mention the shop dog's. I
&gt; love those dog's almost as much as my own k-9's. Seriously people, how
&gt; can you not like a shop dog. You know what I mean.? Anyway.
&gt; The turn around time for a service is eaqual to if not sooner than the
&gt; big guy's. The accessory prices are usually the same or lower than the
&gt; big guy's, and the quality of the bike's are way better. (I'm sorry
&gt; but the Schwinn at walmat or target is not the same Schwinn you will
&gt; get from your lnbs).

&gt;  So again I ponder this sleepless question, why are the big guy's
&gt; doing so well and the local guys struggling?

&gt; Can someone please show me what I'm missing here?

Fascinating discussion here...

I think a lot of neighborhood bike shops frankly deserve to die.  The
typical IBD has a few undistinguished asian-made bike lines, weak
service offerings, ill-paid incompetent mechanics, and uninteresting
apparel and accessory choices for which they must charge full list to
survive.  They do nothing to promote the sport or facilitate bike
culture, and they'll happily sell someone an ill-fitting or
inappropriate product in order to make a sale.  The bread and butter
product for these shops here in Los Angeles is $100-$150 chinese beach
cruisers, which the big boxes sell for less.  In the age of the
internet and complete bikes by mail, why should these places survive?
The world owes nobody a living.

Why are IBDs so darn resistant to experimenting with alternative
formats and niche markets?  This is true even in Los Angeles, an
absolutely huge cycling market with plenty of room for
differentiation.  High end service a la vecchio's, custom bike builds,
quality suspension work for increasingly complex mountain bikes (VERY
hard to find), coffee bars, fixed gear specific, beach cruiser or
chopper specific, commuter specific, coffee bars, interesting and
stylish apparel...there's so much.  We are beginning to see niche
local shops like this in LA but there's plenty of opportunity out
there.

&gt;&gt; That's pretty much the way I approach it. For me, mail order is
&gt;&gt; inconvenient. I'm not home during delivery hours so I invariably have to
&gt;&gt; pick the package up at the shipping company's depot.

&gt; LOL, obviously in your area Fed Ex and UPS don't perform their famous,
&gt; ring, drop, and run procedure on packages. I think it varies by
&gt; neighborhood. Clearly they've determined than not dealing with multiple
&gt; deliveries and will call is worth an occasional stolen package.

In some neighborhoods, the percentage of unattended packages stolen
would approach 100%.
