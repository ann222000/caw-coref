Some have suggested to me that the high gasoline prices - despite excuses
generated by the petroleum-industry-controlled media - have been a
&quot;punishment&quot; imposed by the greedy petroleum cartel. I don't really know
what's exactly the reason or reasons for this sharp increase in the past
several weeks but one thing is clear: The Iraq situation is not going well
and somehow this has a lot to do with such steep gasoline prices.

This is one more confirmation to the fact that the war in Iraq has
everything to do with OIL.

Another big problem is CHINA. Everytime you consumer a product that is made
in China, you are contributing to the economic problem in the US,
indirectly. First, the greed American corporation boost their profit margin
by closing down the shops in the US and have their products pumped out from
China with no regards to consumers' safety and quality of their products.
Second, the strong apetite for energy in China has upset the balance of the
demand for crude oil. To make the problem worse, the growing group of
&quot;stupid and ugly Americans&quot; with gas-guzzling SUVs have contributed to the
burden of the refineries around the nation.

What ever the case might be, someone is getting very very rich in the past
several months at the expense of more people become poorer. And this is
going well according to the current Bush's policies of running this country
into the shit hole.

It is not certain that the damages caused by the reckless management of the
Bush dynasty is reversible. Every time you pump gas think of how big of a
smile Bush's friends in the petroleum cartel have. In fact they laugh at
you and your family for bending over for so long. Perhaps the punishment is
going to continue until the people wake up?

I drive trucks for living and Bush does not care about the people like
myself. I can't wait until November!
