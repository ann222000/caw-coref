Well guys heres the &quot;official&quot; announcement of the game scheduled for
this saturday (or sunday if better). Please confirm if you will be
there or not ahead of time, theres nothing worse than last minute
bailing.

On an unrelated note, I think we all had a great time at CHF, I hope we
can go there every once and a while to mix things up. Memberships are
120 dollars, which all things considered is well worth all day air and
free access for a WHOLE YEAR. Some of you may want to consider this!

I had a great time at the park as well. Its a closer drive for me, and
I like the variety that the park offers. The $20 to get in makes it
something that I can only justify every once in awhile. That said, I'd
love to try to go again, maybe late february or march.

Looking forward to lakeland paintball this weekend. Saturday should be
just fine for me, krissi and maddie.

I know that Wesley and Hamilton will not be able to make it. So its very
important that we all try to be there if we are going to make it work. I
think I can snag a friend who Ive asked several times. If all works out we
can get to 10-14 people easily.

&gt; Anyone thought about inviting Dustin, Corey or Doug? Those one timers may
&gt; be interested? I have 3 possibles, but no guarantees.

Would any of you consider moving to sunday? This would allow 2 more of
our regular attending players to come. If not, we can stick to our
prearanged saturday time. However with all of us already committed plus
2 more we will have 12, rather than 9-10 it comes down to 5 vs 5 or 6
vs 6 what do you others think?

On the other hand when I ask my self the question &quot;Will the Operating System
Fail&quot; I alway get this answer.
No. You are not running 32 bit extensions for a 16 bit patch to an 8 bit
operating system originally coded for a 4 bit microprocessor, written by a 2
bit company, that can't stand 1 bit of competition.

Well guys, I say saturday and sunday, a few of you dont want to miss out,
and need sunday and others of you saturday is better, so myself and my
brother, and whoever else wants too, will play both saturday and sunday. In
fact, it would be cool to try a few new game styles if enough of us want to
play both days. Anyone up for 2 mornings worth of paint?

I can definitely make it Sat. morning, but there is no way I can make both
days. I am headed out of town next week and need to conserve cash. But I am
super excited about trying out the new games.
