I sold a Icom receiver to Gottahaveit1995, who also has a Ebay account
under the name of Radio-Mart.  He emailed me after receiving it
claiming it had been damaged in shipping, but offered no evidence that
it was not working as it was described in auction.  Anyway, he sent
some pictures of the &quot;damage&quot; and it was basically some pre-existing
cosmetic dings to the rear of the cabinet.

He opened the dipsute but did not mention any damage specifically,
just that it was damaged in transit, which it was not as he did not
describe any crushed boxes, etc.  He than said in the dispute that he
was afraid to plug it in to test because it might explode or something
ludicrous like that.  I was honest with PayPal in that I described it
in good working condition and that the buyer never inquired about any
cosmetic issues and it was sold as-is.  As a consequence PayPal froze
money in my account.  He then went on to say that he would accept $40
so that he could buy a new case for the radio which I did not even get
a chance to reply to because he escalated the claim after I had made
only one reply to his charges.

Well after doing some research on the Ebay ID &quot;Gottahaveit1995&quot;, I
discovered a lot about him and how he supposedly bids on his own
items.  Then I get this email from him after confronting him with
this:

I am no liar, yes I own Radio Mart Inc,, I am not and never denied
this

not that it has anything to do with our transaction

now be the man and step up to the plate and do the right thing here.

Martyn

I would suggest anyone who does business on Ebay block him from him
doing any transactions.  I cannot believe that he is still in business
on Ebay doing business the way he does.  I guess the bottom line for
Ebay is the almighty dollar so they look the other way.

I'm certainly not a fan of Radio-Mart, but you admit not informing the buyer
of cosmetic flaws. Saying you sold the radio &quot;as-is&quot; doesn't cut it when you
admit knowing about the dings... and admit not telling the seller about the
dings. You knew this info would affect the sale of your item, so don't take
yourself out of the blame.

Best advice I can give is either pay Radio-Mart what he asks or take the
item back with a full refund.

Luke,

Did you List and Reveal these Defects in the Item in
the eBay Auction Listing ?

Did You State that the Item was Used ?

Did You State that the Item was being Sold &quot;As Is&quot; ?

What Did Radio-Mart et. al. pay for the Item

Did Radio-Mart Pay -via-you- to have the
Item Shipped to Him ?

How did you Ship this Item ?
USPS [ ] - UPS [ ] - FedEx [ ]

Did you offer Radio-Mart the 'Option' of Buying
Shipping Insurance ?

Did Radio-Mart buy the Shipping Insurance ?

Was the Shipping Box Damaged ?

- - - It all begins with what you did initially
on eBay.

Tell Radio-Mart that Shipping Damage is the
responsibility of the Shipper and the Receiver.

For some reason my post last night is not showing up in the group.
Anyway I have attached a link to the picture of the &quot;damage&quot; that he
is claiming.  It is obvious that it is just wear and tear from being
picked up and set down and stored on it's side as how the radio is
designed.  And the radio was sold as-is and was missing the main
tuning knob, so that should have been a clue right there that the
buyer (Radio-Mart) was not getting a mint specimen.  A normal person
would have just shrugged off any small cosmetic imperfections and used
the damn thing, but he was buying it obviously with the intention of
trying to resell it.  There has to be better ways of making money than
by buying things off of Ebay and reselling them I would think?

Here is the &quot;damage&quot; he is claiming:

http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=4ze2s8i&amp;s;=1

Now he is claiming since I stood up to his crap that he is going to go
through his credit card company and get the money back from them for
the purchase instead of waiting for the PayPal dispute to finish.
This guy is lower than low.  What a slimeball.  I would suggest again
that everyone do everything they can to put this guy out of business.
I am going to get ahold of Ebay fraud and let them know what is going
on.

&gt; Luke
&gt;From your description it would appear that you did not fully disclose

the condition.   It would be in your best interest to just take the
radio back and give a credit.  Otherwise you face the real possibility
of his credit card company reversing the charge and hitting your
account and allowing him to keep the radio.  I'll tell you right now
his credit card company has no interest in brokering a transfer of
that radio.  They will very likely give him a credit and debit your
account.

There are a lot of specifics about this transaction that you have
decided to omit, which makes me think your description is slanted to
your side.

It would be in your best interest to ratchet back your rhetoric and
unwind the deal amicably before you end up on the short end of the
stick.

Like,
I would strongly suggest 2 things:
1. get a lawyer (you might need him/her)
2. file a fraud complaint with both the FBI and the police in his local area
(the info is findable from the contact in the whois database for his
website)

after you file the report, get a copy and send it to his credit card
company. the last thing they want is to be involved in a fraud complaint.

You might not consider it damage, but the buyer does... and that's all that
matters. In any case, you're going to lose this fight with Radio-Mart and
Paypal. They will end up issuing Radio-Mart a refund and you'll be out both
funds and radio. I'd start working direct with Radio-Mart immediately to
minimize your losses.

What makes you so sure any other buyer wouldn't make similar claims about
condition? Would they be &quot;slimeballs&quot; as you say? Simply ask for the radio
back, issue a refund, block Radio-Mart from bidding on your auctions, and
call it a lesson learned.

I think you are wrong my friend.  First off, he filed a claim under
&quot;item not as described&quot; or something similar.  I made no claims to the
cosmetic condition of the radio.  In fact, like I said earlier it was
missing the main tuning knob so that might be a clue that it was not
in mint condition.  Secondly, his claim was that it was damaged in
shipping, while offering no evidence or description of the damage.  I
sold the radio as-is in working condition.  No claims that it was in
any kind of condition beyond that it was working.  Now I could be
wrong but I do not see how they could rule in his favor.  He received
the radio just as I advertised it on the auction.

You're confusing fact with legalism, here. The facts are on your
side. You listed the radio As-Is, and you made no claims. The reasonable
buyer would bid accordingly and accept what he/she got.

But you're not dealing with a reasonable bidder, here. And the rules
and procedures favor him. Quite simply, he can make accusations that you
cannot disprove. That's all eBay and PayPal are interested in. The facts
simply don't matter.

This guy is a master manipulator of the e-Bay/PayPal system. He's a
professional victim. His life position is one of blamelessness. And he's
vicious when criticized. He's ruthless when he thinks there's a dollar
left on the table for the harvesting. And he doesn't play fair.

He routinely misrepresents his products, and wouldn't hesitate to
launch a slander action against any bidder who made such a claim. Even
if the claims made were absolute truth. Remember, when someone is
manipulating the rules, the facts are not relevant.

You will not win an action against this guy. Those who sit in
judgement, PayPal and e-Bay, have no interest in justice. Only
resolution of a conflict with an eye to maximum profitability. Since
RM's record is volume sales and large monthly PayPal and eBay fee
payment, resolution will be in favor of RM. The eBay Power Seller
division was created to protect such sellers.  And both PayPal and eBay
make big noise out of 'Buyer Protection.' That's an unrecoverable double
whammy, right there.

For you to fight this will cost you thousands of dollars in legal
fees, and even then you are not likely to win. If you were, RM would
have been booted off eBay years ago.

But that's not happened. That should tell you all you need to know.

Take the advice of the other posters. Resolve this before it gets to
a stage that can do you harm. And don't do business with this goatfucker
again.

You've seen, now, what he really thinks of those he does business
with. Don't expect him to be reasonable. And don't expect him to give
up, either. As a 'mere morsel' he has no reason to believe you cannot be

I don't see why this is such a big problem.  He claims shipping damage
(although being the scumbag he is, we know it's a scam).

Play along.  Respond to the Paypal dispute, agreeing to refund his money
once the claim has been settled.  He will put the radio back in the ORIGINAL
box and packing, and have UPS/Fedex/DSL pick it up.  They will evaluate the
claim and either pay not.   Once you have either the money or the radio,
give him his money back and consider it a lesson learned - most of us
already have both of his IDs blocked and you do the same.

CTV,

Tell Radio-Mart that you will provide a Refund to Him :
After He Ships the Radio Back to you at His Expense.

Carefully Inspect the Radio when it comes back and
make sure that nothing is Missing or has been Removed.

Radio-Mart is 'noted' for buying a Fully Option Packed Radio
and removing the parts and selling them; and also selling
the basic radio by itself.

-IF- Radio-Mart does not send the Radio back NO ReFund [.]

keep us informed of this developing drama ~ RHF

&gt; How do you block his or anyone elses Ebay acocunt?
">

You can go into MY EBAY, and set up preferences that block bidders
by region, or ID. You can maintain a blocked bidders list and weed out
undesirables ongoing.

I had a Canadian bidder on one of my auctions last year get quite
huffy with me. The listing said specifically that the sale was for USA
bidders only. He wrote to me and all but demanded that I consider
shipping to Canada. I told him clearly 'No.' He bid anyway. I found the
block bidder's preference, and that ended that noise.

eBay offers a considerable range of solutions to bidder problems, if
you get out ahead of them. Once the problem has begun, however,
resolution rarely goes against the member with the biggest volume.

&gt; he has sold tens of thousands of radios, etc.  Funny though that he
&gt; was the buyer in this case huh, not the other way around.  Some big
&gt; shot he is.  Well Martyn, if you are reading this you can s@*&amp; my you
&gt; know what.  I could really care less about the money at this juncture,
&gt; it is not going to break me either way.  I have learned a valuable
&gt; lesson not to use PayPal anymore and to stay away from Radio-Mart's
&gt; auctions.
">

It's really important that you realize how precarious your position is
since he filed a claim directly with the credit card company.  It
would be in your best interest to just take the radio back and give a
credit.  Otherwise you face the real possibility of his credit card
company reversing the charge and hitting your account and allowing him
to keep the radio.  I'll tell you right now his credit card company
has no interest in brokering a transfer of that radio.

Reading about the high bidder on a Drake, who was outbid by
GottaHaveit1995 at the last minute, it appears that he keeps his
bidders' ID's private to keep anyone from noticing that he's the high
bidder on his own auctions, to drive the second high bidder to his
maximum bid.

The guy is bad news. And the more that comes out about him, it's a
wonder he's still in business, and not in jail.

Except, of course, that the only entity that can be more corrupt than
radio-mart is eBay/PayPal itself.

He can endrun Paypal completely and use his credit card company to
effect a complete chargeback.  Do't leave yourself wide open while you

Yes, I saw that.  I am surprised that they do not rename the group to
radio-mart-sucks, or something similar.  My god, the majority of the
messages are about him.  Well, I gave in to his extortion and gave him
$30 to drop the dispute.  I did not want to but figured it would not
be hanging over my head anymore.  And extortion is exactly what it
was.  I am just waiting until he lists the radio to see what kind of
description he gives it.

Please tell all of your fellow SWL's and Ham friends to be aware of
this thief.  How he can still be in business via Ebay makes me sick to
my stomach and really tells me a lot about the business practices of
Ebay.  They are just as guilty as he is in my opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Luke

&gt;&gt; Like,
&gt;&gt; I would strongly suggest 2 things:
&gt;&gt; 1. get a lawyer (you might need him/her)
&gt;&gt; 2. file a fraud complaint with both the FBI and the police in his local
&gt;&gt; area
&gt;&gt; (the info is findable from the contact in the whois database for his
&gt;&gt; website)

&gt;&gt; after you file the report, get a copy and send it to his credit card
&gt;&gt; company. the last thing they want is to be involved in a fraud complaint.

&gt; Thanks for the laughs Erica.

&lt;irrelevant BS snipped&gt;

think its funny do you?
try it sometime.
interstate fraud of any kind is considered a FELONY.
it can be punished by no less than 5 years in jail and up to $100,000 in
fines.

THIS STORY BY OTHER PEOPLE.

by the way, paypal does NOT guarantee against damage, only that you do or

he does NOT have a case against you. he is bluffing.

Luke:

Radio-Mart is a liar and a cheat, plain and simple. a few months ago,
He purchased a old KWM-2 from a older fellow down the street from me. I had
seen this radio from time to time sitting out in his garage uncovered for
YEARS, It was filthy dirty!

After Martyn bought it, a week later he was selling it on Ebay as a
&quot;pristine&quot; radio that had been pampered and &quot;covered up&quot; all it's life!
....Go figure!

I would NEVER buy anything from this guy, Do a Google search on radio-mart
and you can read the horror stories for HOURS!

You made 2 BIG mistakes,  #1, You dealt with
gottahaveitsoicanresellitonebay1995, and #2, you used Paypal!

I do believe if there were cosmetic issues with the radio, you should
disclose them both in photos and text. It is not up to the buyer to
inquire. That said, RadioMart(TM) is a jerk.

&gt;I don't see why this is such a big problem.  He claims shipping damage

&gt; Play along.  Respond to the Paypal dispute, agreeing to refund his money
&gt; once the claim has been settled.  He will put the radio back in the
&gt; ORIGINAL box and packing, and have UPS/Fedex/DSL pick it up.  They will
&gt; evaluate the claim and either pay not.   Once you have either the money or

&gt; I am no liar, yes I ownRadio MartInc,, I am not and never denied
&gt; this

&gt; not that it has anything to do with our transaction

&gt; now be the man and step up to the plate and do the right thing here.

&gt; I would suggest anyone who does business on Ebay block him from him
&gt; doing any transactions.  I cannot believe that he is still in business
&gt; on Ebay doing business the way he does.  I guess the bottom line for
&gt; Ebay is the almighty dollar so they look the other way.

Yes, I would suggest everyone block both of his Ebay ID's.  Ebay will
do NOTHING to stop him, EVEN after sending me a threat via email.
Calling me the &quot;C&quot; word and telling me to watch my back.  See I gave
in to his extortion and paid him off.  He was a fool and left me a
good feedback so I left him feedback accordingly.  He emailed me back
with the threat.  Ebay won't do anything because it was not sent
through their mail system, even though it is clear the radio-mart/
Martyn sent it to me.  Screw both of them and spread the word
please.
