1. Olmert's Latest Gesture: Conditional Pardon for 178 Terrorists

by Hillel Fendel

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has agreed to an arrangement whereby 178 wanted
Fatah terrorists are granted amnesty, in exchange for their promise to stop
terrorism.  The 178 have already signed their commitment to cease engaging
in terrorism against Israel.

The name of Zekarya Zubeidi, who has been wanted for many years for his
terrorist activity against Israel, is on the list as well. The Prime
Minister's Bureau clarified on Sunday morning that this was indeed the case.
The Bureau even apologized for the &quot;technical glitch&quot; that led to the
omission of his name in initial reports.

Representatives for Zubeidi signed this morning his commitment to stop
terrorism against Israel.

Palestinian Authority sources say that many of the 178 will be eligible to
receive up to 60,000 shekels for turning in their weapons.  An M-16 rifle
will net them 55,000-60,000 shekels, a Kalachnikov - 15,000 shekels, and a
pistol between 12,000 and 24,000 shekels.  The money is to come from the
PA's coffers.

The PA will reissue weapons to many of the 178 who will join the PA's
security forces.

The 178 terrorists will benefit from a trial period of three months in which
they will not be arrested, unless Israel receives information that they are
planning terrorism.  If during the three months they do not engage in
terrorism, they will be officially removed from the &quot;wanted&quot; list.

However, they apparently will not receive an official and irreversible
pardon, such that if ever they return to terrorism, they will be liable to
be tried on their previous crimes as well.

The Israel Law center (Shurat HaDin) has filed a petition with the High
Court against the plan by Prime Minister Olmert to remove 178 Arab
terrorists from the &quot;wanted list.&quot;

The petition claims that the deal was made in secret with Palestinian
Authority officials and ignores international law that requires Israel to
bring to trial terrorists who have committed crimes against humanity.

Olmert also previously agreed to release 250 imprisoned terrorists, though
their names have not yet been determined.

Reactions
Several Cabinet ministers are against some of Olmert's latest gestures.
Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) said the
mass pardons are a &quot;grave error.&quot;  He explained that he is remaining in the
government in order to &quot;minimize the damage done&quot; by the government.

Trade Minister Eli Yishai (Shas) said that he is against gestures of this
nature to Abu Mazen, explaining that Abu Mazen must make more efforts to
help himself instead of relying on Israel to prop him up.

Welfare Minister Yitzchak Herzog (Labor) said Israel has no choice but to
make difficult concessions in order to strengthen the &quot;moderate&quot; elements in
the PA.

The Legal Forum, a group of attorneys who lobbied for civil rights of Gush
Katif residents, has called upon Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann to object
to what it calls the &quot;laundering of the murderers.&quot;   Forum Director Nachi
Eyal says, &quot;The government has reached new heights in proving the truth of
the Sages' dictum, 'Whoever is merciful to the cruel will end up being cruel
to the merciful.'  It was cruel to the youths in Amona

6735DBD637488.htm&gt; and during the Disengagement, and is not closing their
criminal files regarding their protests - and yet is now showing compassion
to debased murderers.  The message being given is an abuse of justice and
the victory of the murderers over their victims.&quot;

In response to sharp criticism from the Likud for the amnesty plan, an
official of the Prime Minister's office said Sunday, &quot;The Likud has
forgotten that in February, 2005 [then-ministers] Binyamin Netanyahu and
Limor Livnat, both of the Likud, enthusiastically backed&quot; moves to free Arab
terrorists.

2. Arch-Terrorist Hawatmeh Allowed in &quot;For a Few Days&quot;

by Nissan Ratzlav-Katz and Hillel Fendel

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has approved the entry into the country of
arch-terrorist Naif Hawatmeh, head of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine terrorist group. Also reportedly approved for entry
are other arch-terrorists such as the PLO's Farouk Kadoumi and Ahmed Ghanem.

Olmert specified that Hawatmeh would only be allowed in for a few days, and
not to reside permanently in the Palestinian Authority-controlled
territories.

Hawatmeh, who founded the PFLP and the Marxist DFLP, lives in Syria and was
responsible for one of the most heinous terrorist attacks in Israel's
history: The attack on a school in Maalot, in which 22 children and 2
teachers were massacred.  Hawatmeh's men attacked a school building in which
were sleeping dozens of children from Tzfat who were on a trip; the
terrorists held them hostage for several hours before opening fire.  In
addition, Hawatme's DPLP also carried out the Avivim bus attack, in which
nine children and three adults were murdered.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is set to convene a
special session of the &quot;Palestine National Council&quot; (PNC), the formal
governing body of the PLO.
DFLP terrorists were involved in vicious attacks on schoolchildren in Avivim
in 1970 and in Maalot in 1974.
Abbas is seeking PNC approval for a new PA government based on a mainly
Fatah membership. Fatah is the terrorist group headed by Abbas and which
forms the backbone of the PLO. Abbas believes that participation in the PNC
meeting by veteran terrorist leaders from Fatah and from other factions will
assist him in gaining legitimacy for his new government.

Hawatmeh was an outspoken critic of the PLO leadership under Yasser Arafat.

Transportation Minister Sha'ul Mofaz of Kadima, a former IDF Chief of Staff
and Defense Minister, came out strongly against enabling Hawatmeh to enter.
Calling him a &quot;mass murderer,&quot; Mofaz said that if Hawatmeh wants to
strengthen Abu Mazen, the Fatah leader should go to Hawatmeh in Syria for
the purpose.

Knesset Member Uri Ariel (National Union-NRP) said Friday that the
government should let Hawatmeh enter Judea and Samaria - and then arrest and
try him for the Maalot and Avivim massacres. Echoing Ariel's sentiment,
Likud MK Limor Livnat called on the IDF to immediately arrest Hawatmeh and
other terrorists who have allegedly been given entry permits.

On Friday, an official Likud movement statement said that it would be a
mistake to allow &quot;one of the most cruel terrorists ever&quot; - Hawatmeh - to
enter Israel.

Arab affairs expert Dr. Guy Bechor says it is a &quot;dangerous experiment&quot; to
allow Syrian-sympathizers Hawatmeh and Kadoumi into Israel.  He writes that
this attempt to strengthen Abu Mazen is a continuation of the mistake made
in the 90's to try to strengthen Arafat.

Hamas to Hold Rival Government Meeting
Wary of the strengthening of Abu Mazen's competing rule in the PA, Hamas
announced that it would be convening a rival meeting of the PA legislature.
The Hamas-controlled body, however, is not recognized by Fatah, as it was
ostensibly overruled and dissolved by Abu Mazen's emergency measures last
month after Hamas forcibly took control of the Gaza region.

The PA parliament to be convened by Hamas in Gaza is to vote against the
emergency government established by Abu Mazen and headed by Acting Prime
Minister Salam Fayyad. The meeting will take place Sunday, a Hamas official
said, and would supersede in advance any decisions made by the PNC later
this week at Abbas's Ramallah meeting.

In response, Fatah officials said they would boycott what they called the
&quot;illegal Hamas meeting.&quot;

3. Sons of Aaron - The Priestly Tribe - Convene in Jerusalem

by Hana Levi Julian

A four-day International Conference of Descendants of the biblical figure
Aaron, the Priestly Tribe (Kohanim) and the whole Tribe of Levi to which the
Kohanim are a part, begins on Sunday, July 15.

&quot;Bring forth Aharon's sons..Then anoint them, just as you anointed their
father, so that they will be Kohanim (&quot;priests&quot;) to Me. It will be done so
that their anointing will make them an eternal [hereditary] priesthood for
all generations. Moses proceeded to do exactly as G-d had commanded him.&quot;
(Exodus 40:14, 15)

Throughout Jewish history and to this day, Jews are careful to note which
families belong to the tribe of Levi and the priestly family of Aaron. At
the special gathering this week in Jerusalem, they will learn more about
their roots and discuss the latest research proving their genetic ties.

The International Conference of Kohanim and the Tribe of Levi falls on the
first day of the Hebrew month of Av and the beginning of the nine-day period
leading up to Tisha B'Av, the second-most solemn fast day in the Jewish
calendar.

It is also the date on which Aharon the High Priest, brother of Moses left
this world to enter the World to Come.

Recent scientific research and DNA testing has allegedly proven a genetic
connection between the descendants of the Tribe of Levi, the biblical
priests and their assistants who began with the sons of Aharon.

Project director Professor Karl Skorecki, one of the main researchers in the
seminal &quot;Kohen Genetic Signature&quot; study, is scheduled to present the
findings Monday, July 16 at 11:30 a.m. in &quot;HaKotel Hall&quot; auditorium, near
the Western Wall Plaza.

&quot;This is not only the first family reunion of the Jewish priestly dynasty in
nearly 2,000 years,&quot; said conference organizer Rabbi Yaakov Kleiman in a
statement sent to the media. &quot;The research and information we will share
will play an important role in appreciating and maintaining our unique and
precious heritage.&quot;  Rabbi Kleiman is the director of The Center for Kohanim
in Jerusalem and the author of &quot;DNA &amp; Tradition.&quot;

Molecular geneticists have recently discovered the &quot;Kohen Modal Haplotype,&quot;
a Y-chromosome DNA lineage signature shared by a majority of both Ashkenazic
and Sephardic Kohanim.

This indicates direct patrilineal descent of present-day Kohanim from an
ancient ancestor, genetically dated to have lived approximately 3,000 years
ago, corresponding to the time of the Exodus from Egypt.

Kohanim and other &quot;members of the tribe,&quot; the Levi'im (Levites), are being
invited to participate in what has been billed as the &quot;first 'family
reunion' held since the days of the Temple in Jerusalem.&quot;

Four days of seminars, touring, presentations of the latest research and
lectures by leading rabbis and scientists on such topics as genetic
genealogy, biblical history and contemporary issues in the Jewish legal
arena will be offered in English as well as Hebrew.

4. Israeli Forces Captured Terrorist Involved in Shalit Abduction

by Nissan Ratzlav-Katz

In a precision operation executed last month in Gaza, Israeli soldiers and
secret service operatives captured a member of the terrorist cell that
kidnapped IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit in June of 2006. The operation took
place on June 9 in Rafiah, on the Egyptian border with southern Gaza.
Military censorship of the capture in Gaza was lifted on Friday, July 13.

The captured terrorist, Muhammad Salameh Abed Soufi, 30, is a resident of
Rafiah and a member of Hamas. He also joined the Public Resistance
Committees (PRC), which is a conglomerate representing various terror groups
in Gaza. The PRC initially claimed responsibility for the attack in which
Shalit was taken captive.

During his interrogation by Israeli security services, Soufi confessed to
his involvement in numerous terrorist attacks, including the abduction of
Gilad Shalit. Soufi said that he

assisted the gunmen who carried out the kidnapping and documented the
operation on film.

On June 25, 2006, a Palestinian Authority terrorist cell carried out an
attack on the Kerem Shalom IDF base just outside the Gaza region. In that
raid, two IDF soldiers were killed, a third was injured, and Cpl. Shalit was
taken captive.

Soufi was a party to many attacks on Israeli civilian and military targets
in the past few years, including a fatal infiltration in 2002. In that
incident, several PA gunmen entered the &quot;Africa&quot; military outpost near Kerem
Shalom, killed four IDF soldiers and injured two others. In addition, IDF
spokespersons reported that Soufi was involved in rocket attacks on Jewish
towns in the western Negev, as well as in bombing attacks that injured IDF
soldiers.

5. Israeli Satellite Firm Blindsided by Stockholders

by Hana Levi Julian

Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International N.V, a subsidiary
of Elbit, is being sued by several of its stockholders after the company
refused to provide images to the government of Venezuela.

According to media reports, the sale was blocked by Israel's Ministry of
Defense due to Venezuela's close alliance with Iran. ImageSat is owned in
part by the Israeli government.

The disgruntled stockholders, who include several minority investors from
Israel, the U.S. and Canada, claim the company &quot;breached its fiduciary
and/or contractual obligations to the detriment of the plaintiffs&quot; by
rejecting deals that would have profited the company and the stockholders
themselves.

ImageSat sells satellite imagery for various purposes - including espionage
-- to countries around the world that do not have their own satellites. Most
of the company's work is non-military in nature, sources said.

According to Israeli law, ImageSat is forbidden to sell images to countries
within 1,500 miles of Israel. Sales to Cuba, Iran and North Korea are also
off-limits. Venezuela does not fall under that restriction, nor is Venezuela
included on a specific list of enemy countries, despite its cozy
relationship with a number of Israel's worst enemies.

The investors claim in their $6 billion lawsuit that politics destroyed a
number of lucrative deals, including the one with Venezuela. An initial
hearing is set for October.

Cozy Welcome for Iran's President

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad found a particularly warm welcome in
Venezuela on the first leg of a Latin American tour in January. Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez literally greeted Ahmadinejad with open arms.

The two leaders, who share virulent anti-American and anti-Israel
sentiments, reiterated a previously negotiated agreement to create a $2
billion fund to support projects in countries that might be receptive to
their political views. The fund, which Chavez called &quot;a mechanism for
liberation,&quot; was also to be used to finance investments in their own
countries.

Venezuela has made strong efforts to build ties with other enemies of Israel
as well, including the Hamas terrorist organization, the Palestinian
Authority and Syria.

Last October, Chavez accused Israel of carrying out &quot;genocide&quot; against
Hizbullah terrorists during the Second Lebanon War.

The South American nation was also one of the first countries to have
accepted the Hamas terrorist organization as a legitimate governing body.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro announced at a meeting in Tehran
with Damascus-based Hamas politburo head Khaled Mashaal last March that the
PA would be allowed to open an embassy in his nation's capital, Caracas.
