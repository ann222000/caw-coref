Where's Doug? Terrorist ramblers spreading Foot &amp; Mouth, surely!!

That aside, why this time and not last month? Is it because there aren't a
huge number of rural footpaths in the current protection zone, so there are
more people wanting to use a smaller number (compared to the areas last
month, where the population density is rather less). I managed to find other
places to go when some of my local paths were closed recently for the same
reason. There are even police and trading standards keeping folk out.

On Radio 4 this morning they were saying the Police would be out in
force to ensure walkers and ramblers did not enter the restricted zone.

In the big panic some years ago someone was arrested and prosecuted
for walking along a path. The other side of the boundary of the path
was a golf course, the golfers were not arrested and prosecuted.

You would be surprised at the lengths the authorities and farmers go to.
During the 2001 F&amp;M crisis, there were places on the A9 and A96 where
you had to slow down to get your vehicle wheels sterilised. And even if
you arrived at Inverness airport you had to walk through a trough of
disinfectant.

The local schools and colleges have such troughs at the entrances at
present. `All country recreational activities have ceased, and even
where shows went ahead in the brief period of &quot;all clear&quot; uttered by the
government's chief vet no animals, not even horses and dogs were taken
to the shows. All vehicles leaving and entering the sites were
sterilised.

Of course townies like Duhg and Hansen know better.

Feel free to back up that assertion with reference to a posting in
which I have claimed that cyclists never kill pedestrians.

If you are unable or unwilling to point to such a posting people may
like to draw their own conclusions about the veracity of your
assertions, both this one and other ones.

You may also try and twist one of my postings, in your usual
fashion. If you do people may like to draw their own conclusions
about this too.

You may have the last word.

that the motorist who killed one pedestrian and severely injured
another, while they were walking along the pavement, has admitted
culpable homicide. Sentencing will follow reports.

Which part of that posting do you have difficulty understanding? If
it is the bit where I say that I have yet to hear of a case where a
pavement cyclist caused such injuries then feel free to give us an
example of a case where a pavement cyclist caused such injuries. The
injuries are outlined in various mass media articles and I will not
outline them again.

However, I note that you have not come up with a posting of mine in
which I claim that cyclists don't kill pedestrians. Huff and puff
all you like, twist what I have typed in your usual fashion, but it
will not cover your inability to back up your assertion with an
example.

To answer it properly one would have to consider the routes used by
golfers on their way to and from the golf links and whether the
golfers crossed agricultural land at any part of their routes. That
would allow a proper comparison with those using the path.

The answer to this question would be that the area concerned is
surrounded by agricultural land and the North Sea. I think it fair
to assume that not many of the golfers or walkers came via the North
sea and thus they both crossed agricultural land to get to the
location.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Uh huh, this is presumably the same observation that led you to conclude

&gt; &gt;Ah, more of your attempts to twist what has been said. I did not use the

&gt; &gt;&quot;Message-ID: &lt;thtfe3lovvhs4r4p96kfjkpr90ug66h ... @4ax.com&gt;

&gt; &gt;I see from http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1458092007
&gt; &gt;that the motorist who killed one pedestrian and severely injured
&gt; &gt;another, while they were walking along the pavement, has admitted
&gt; &gt;culpable homicide. Sentencing will follow reports.

&gt; &gt;The usual trolls here are very keen to tell us of the evils of
&gt; &gt;pavement cycling, but I have yet to hear of a case where a pavement
&gt; &gt;cyclist caused such injuries.&quot;

&gt; Which part of that posting do you have difficulty understanding?

None of it.

I asked whether you were claiming that the path only went along the boundary

The path is part of a network of paths, roads and ground used by the

You have still not answered the question. I was not asking about the paths,
the local area, the golf course, the use made of any of them, the walker who
used the path, the golfers or for any judgment on the justice of prosecuting
someone who was acting illegally but not prosecuting people who were not. I
was asking a very simple question about what you were saying. Either you
were claiming that the path only went along the boundary of a golf course
and did not cross agricultural land at any part of its route, in which case
your answer is 'yes' or you were not, in which case your answer is 'no'.

If you really want to make comparisons of the danger presented by the
different activities, there are a couple of supplementary questions that
have to be answered in addition to the original. What acreage of the golf
course is given over to grazing, compared to the acreage of grazing land the
path, or any paths accessible from it pass through? What disinfection
precautions were in place for people legally accessing the golf course,
compared to the total lack of precautions that would be taken by someone who
illegally used the footpath?

Incorrect.

If one is to consider the path not in isolation but as part of a
route then one must do the same thing with the golf links and those
who use it.

Failure to make a like with like comparison on your part is either
accidental or deliberate, but it makes no difference to the validity
of the comparison.

You may have the last word if you wish.

In that case, answer the original question, which was not about the path,
but about the statement you made about it and does remain unanswered, and
the two supplementary questions that do consider the path as part of the
