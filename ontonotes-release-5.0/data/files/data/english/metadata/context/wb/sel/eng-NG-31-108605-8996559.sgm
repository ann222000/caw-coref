I was not able to follow up on the thread about deaths (who killed
who)  as I have been involved with nearly killing myself trying to
clear the water strainer on the bottom of my sailboat (the intake for
the diesel) so a bunch of Sea Scouts can use my boat this next
weekend.  Later this week, I'll follow up on it and all you lefties
(by calling them accssories to mass murder) I insulted can remind me.
I was referring to both recent deaths from the Castro regime and
Ethiopa along with Tianemen Square (w ecan Blame Bush 1 for that one
too)

William Black:

I singled you out for a comment you made about &quot;at least 3 political
parties in the Soviet Union&quot; that sounded a lot like attempting to
justify the communists as being pro-democratic.  Did I misinterpret
your remark?

I should apologize to lefties younger than 45 as most of the
atrocities occurred before their time.  I apologize.
However, if you are a leftie older than 45, you have blood on your
hands, lots of it for aiding and abetting the mass murders.  There are
very few who are not guilty of this.

Of course it isn't.

All the parties were completely under the control of the Central Comittee of
the Communist Party.

However with the fall of the USSR the two 'other' parties became independant
of the Communist Party and all three have representitives in the Duma.

Just how ignorant are you about matters you choose to pontificate on?

Very few lefties openly disaproved of the Soviet Union or Mao's China
or even Pol Pot until the atrocities became too obvious to ignore.  I
do not remember ANY lefties criticizing the re-education camps or
forced relocations or killings after the fall of South Vietnam to the
communist aggressors.  I do not recall ANY lefties criticizing the
commie regime in Ethiopia that purposefully caused the famine there.
If one looks at famines in the past 100 yrs, ALL major famines were
intentionally caused by leftist govts.  The poor judgement of American
leftists in accepting this  is the sort of poor judgement that we
should not allow to run our country because they will simply make the
same mistakes they made then.

I believed Mr Blacks remark was a defense of the Soviet Union. He says

Mountbatten didn't have any control over food supplies to the civilian
population.

That was down to the Viceroy,  who was  the appalling Marquis of Linlithgow,
previously the leader of the Unionist Party, that well known bastion of
racist reactionary thought.  He was serving under the,  if this is possible,
even more appalling Robert Gascoyne-Cecil,  5th Marquis of Salisbury, as
Colonial Secretary.  This was the man who became famous for persecuting
Seretse Khama for having the temerity to marry a white woman.

When Oliver Stanley,  who wasn't,  unlike his predecessors, actually a
frothing imbecile, took over the Colonial Office in late 1942 he sacked
Linlithgow as soon as he decently could and appointed Wavell,  a military
man with left wing sympathies and who knew India.

But by then it was too late.

The Bengal famine of 1943 was without doubt caused by a bunch of racist
reactionary Tories.

No Labour Party politicians were allowed access to any part of Indian policy
until the Churchill Conservative Party was soundly thrashed in 1945,  by
which time it was way too late.

Ghandi said of Linlithgow &quot;Of all the high functionaries I have had the
honour of knowing none has been the cause of such deep sorrow to me as you
have been.&quot;

to frogbutt leftist means totalitarian and right means free.

Of course it is.

However some people are unable to understand the difference between 'right
wing but nasty' and 'left wing but nasty'.

They think 'nasty' = 'left wing'.

Indeed,  their whole value system is challenged if they get shown a nasty

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Barbeques on fire by the chalets past the castle headland
I watched the gift shops glitter in the darkness off the Newborough gate
All these moments will be lost in time,  like icecream on the beach
Time for tea.
