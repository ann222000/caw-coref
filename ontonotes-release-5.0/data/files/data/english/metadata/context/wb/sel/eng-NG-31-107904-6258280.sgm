The driver was very probably asleep. How can you not realize that you're
SUDDENLY CLIMBMING a fairly steep slope? Also note the absence of skid
marks. But now it is the highway designers that are put on trial, not
the man directly responsible for the crash. Does everything in our
society has to be made 100% idiot proof?!

Fatigue, however, is not believed to be a factor in the crash, he said.
Officials said a fresh bus driver took over about 4:30 a.m., about an
hour before the wreck (yeah right!!).

A preliminary investigation shows that the bus, headed south on I-75,
took a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane exiting to the left off the
interstate, Moss said. However, the bus apparently failed to stop at the
top of the ramp and "took a bit of a right turn in an attempt to
negotiate it" before plunging to the road below. (Animation: Route taken
before tragedy)

Highway safety experts investigating the crash, which killed six and
injured 29, will study whether the design of a left-side Interstate
highway exit may have been a factor in the accident, an official said
Saturday.

The bus, which was being driven by a fresh driver during an overnight
trip, drove up a left-side exit on Interstate 75 just north of downtown
and crossed a multilane highway overpass before crashing though a
guardrail and plunging onto the highway below, said National
Transportation Safety Board Member Kitty Higgins.

"We know that there have been numerous accidents at Exit 252 for
Northside Drive," Higgins said, referring to the accident site, where a
high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane and an exit lane run side by side.

"We are also interested in the history of the HOV lane and exit ramp
design and will be looking at the signage, highway markings and other
motorist warning devices that were available before exiting at that
particular spot."

There were no skid marks leading up to a stop sign at the end of the
exit, police said.

Witnesses said there was "no indication that there was a concerted
effort to stop the bus" before it reached the top of the exit ramp and
entered the multi-lane bridge over the highway, said Maj. Calvin Moss,
commander of special operations for Atlanta police.

I agree with you, but also hold that left exits are piss poor design.

Considering the time in which the crash occurred, I have doubts that
the replacement driver was as "fresh" as necessary.  A lot of left
exits/entrances are of older design (1960s/70s IIRC).

A society that thrives on making people idiots will of course make
attampts to idiot-proof everything, or else file tons of lawsuits and
go for more government oversight (as if it isn't bad enough as it is).

Yep, I agree.  Just out of curiosity, not ghoulishness, I drove down
the very
route the bus took, a couple of hours ago.  I used the HOV exit ramp
up to
Northside Drive, the whole bit.   It's pretty damn clear for anyone
half-ass
paying attention that they are exiting the freeway, all the way up the
ramp.
There is a big EXIT sign at the beginning, with arrow, and big STOP
ahead
signs on either side of the ramp as you drive up, and of course stop
signs
at the end of the ramp itself.   The AJC (local Atlanta major paper)
has
a huge headline in today's edition: HOW DID IT HAPPEN or someting
similar.  How?  I could write the story with one line:  Driver wasn't
paying attention.  Shit, he must've been semi-conscious.

They don't call that "graveyard shift" for nothing.  I'd call it

&lt;&lt;snip article&gt;&gt;

Most likely a tired driver who is unfamiliar with downtown Atlanta.
There are left exits on the HOV lanes which are on the inside of the
highway (a place that tose of us in the sticks would have a median);
heaven forbid if the environmentally correct in their carpool and/or
hybrid and on their high horse have to mingle with the rest of us to
enter/exit the freeway....

&gt; No, we're talking about HOV lane exits. These are IN ADDITION to the

&gt; money nor space.

&gt; The actual purpose of these left exits is twofold: one is to encourage
&gt; car-pooling by giving HOV lane users a little perq; the other is to
&gt; prevent HOV lane users from crossing 5 lanes of normal (i.e. stopped)
&gt; traffic in order to exit the freeway.

Uh, this particular left exit was *not* to an HOV lane, but up to a
cross bridge overpass *T* intersection.  And that *is* a poor design.
There are several in Virginia like that.

Hell, as a truck driver I've been on ramps so tight and angled totally wrong
that I worry about the truck turning over.

I465 in Indianapolis had one ramp that was always a nightmare. From
southbound I465 onto I70 eastbound, you had to negotiate a royally tight
turn and steep grade. After numerous rollovers and accidents they finally
woke up and redesigned it.

There are many instances of exit ramps where they had little room to use and
as a result, you are forced to go down a steep grade and make a tight turn.
Another example, is from I70 westbound to I75 southbound near Dayton Ohio.

It matters not if the exit ramp is in the left lane, it matters as to how
much room is available to make the turns.

At night, travelling unfamiliar, new territory makes the negotiation even
that much more difficult. What I fail to understand is, one report said the
exit ramp was not completed? Then why was the bus on it to begin with? Then
yes, I agree, some designers have no clues as to how vehicles will handle
the design. It sounds like somebody just slapped it together in a hurry and
said build it with no testing. That is an accident waiting to happen. Just
be glad it wasn't a tanker truck carrying hazardous material that could have
endangered the entire city.

After having read the article and watching the one video, I have concluded
that it was not the design of the ramp itself, rather, one piss poor excuse
of a bridge design.
Compare the height of the bus to the retaining wall height. More than half
the bus is higher than the wall.  Look closer, any other means to protect
rollovers? None what so ever. Any one walking alongside the bridge wall
could easily fall over the edge.
Blame this accident on the bridge designers then shoot the frickin bastards.

Most exit lanes end 'abruptly' at a stop or a light.  The 30 drop has

&gt; &gt; SUDDENLY CLIMBMING a fairly steep slope? Also note the absence of skid
&gt; &gt; marks. But now it is the highway designers that are put on trial, not the
&gt; &gt; man directly responsible for the crash. Does everything in our society has
&gt; &gt; to be made 100% idiot proof?!

&gt; After having read the article and watching the one video, I have concluded
&gt; that it was not the design of the ramp itself, rather, one piss poor excuse
&gt; of a bridge design.
&gt; Compare the height of the bus to the retaining wall height. More than half
&gt; the bus is higher than the wall.  Look closer, any other means to protect
&gt; rollovers? None what so ever. Any one walking alongside the bridge wall
&gt; could easily fall over the edge.
&gt; Blame this accident on the bridge designers then shoot the frickin bastards.

How about blaming it on a driver that busted all the obvious warning
signs.  The bottom line is that you cannot idiot proof anything.

It appears to me the bus was doing a bit of LLB'ing.  Why else was he
in the left lane?

If the driver was so out of it to do this on a left ramp, a right exit
only lane would have had the same result. Poor unattentive drivers tend
to gravitate to the left lane though.

I find that most ramps if I just engine brake while going up hill I've
slowed enough to make a left turn given my typical speed at the bottom of
the ramp having also used the deacceleration area.

Something as heavy as a bus should have easily slowed if the driver had
just let off the throttle going uphill. Gravity is real good at slowing
something heavy down as it goes uphill if no additional energy is added.

If a driver cannot notice he's on a ramp's incline, then he is passed out
or simply too incompetent to be driving.

Not if you're on cruise control.

Maybe the driver went to the back of the bus to use the facilities or
maybe to make a sandwhich then.

He wasn't in the left lane.  He was in a HOV lane which was on the
left side of the highway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with you, but also hold that left exits are piss poor design.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but such designs are used for a reason: to save money and space.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, we're talking about HOV lane exits. These are IN ADDITION to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right-hand exits that non-HOV-lane traffic uses, which saves neither
&gt;&gt;&gt; money nor space.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The actual purpose of these left exits is twofold: one is to encourage
&gt;&gt;&gt; car-pooling by giving HOV lane users a little perq; the other is to
&gt;&gt;&gt; prevent HOV lane users from crossing 5 lanes of normal (i.e. stopped)
&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic in order to exit the freeway.

&gt;&gt; Uh, this particular left exit was *not* to an HOV lane, but up to a
&gt;&gt; cross bridge overpass *T* intersection.  And that *is* a poor design.
&gt;&gt; There are several in Virginia like that.

&gt; You dont understand. That was the HOV's lane &quot;private&quot; exit to the cross
&gt; street. There also is an exit on the right. See here:

Ahhh, yes, I see.
