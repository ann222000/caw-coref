This isn't optimized.  Either spend 4 points on Dex and 0 on Wis, or vice
versa (probably the former is better).

I'm not sure why either would be 'optomized'?

Oh that was 32 point buy, since I hadn't mentioned it, although it
should be obvious.

Here's his background for your perusal:

Ori remembers little of his early childhood, but he has traced back
his beginnings in Sassarine to Cages of Plenty.  He was sold as an
exotic green and purple Ostrich sized egg to the proprietors by an
unknown sailor.  He was hatched and cared for there for a short period
of time, and sold to a customer of the Crimson Genie as a gift for his
favorite lady, one 'Ruby', as an exotic raven.  Ruby dubbed him Mr.
Orion Starshadow the Third, Ori for short.  His foster mother did
indeed treat him as a child of hers, but did not realize he was more
than a pet.

As he grew and his speech became more eloquent than mere squawks and
mimicry, the patrons began to be put off by him, and the Madam
demanded Ruby get rid of him.  Fortunately one patron of hers had
noticed the strange bird earlier and taken an interest in it, and
offered to take it off her hands.   This was a Bard from the Seekers
by the name of Jack.  Jack knew from his obscure knowledge that this
bird was a sentient Kenku, and was determined to find if he could
raise the Ori to have high (relatively compared to Kenku in general)
moral standards.  Jack spent some time raising Ori but had to leave on
frequent trips for performances in strange lands, and left Ori as a
ward of the Seekers.

As the various seekers were also gone frequently he was passed around
from foster to foster, on one of his visits Jack saw this was not good
for Ori, and Ori was grown enough to do basic chores, left him in the
care of the Bent Goblin as a servant 'boy'.  For two years he labored
there, but he had become able to sing in Jack's voice and soon he was
discovered, and songs were demanded by the patrons, and he became a
popular fixture.  As Jack returned one evening and finding Ori
impersonating him, he was given a stern punishment, and told never to
impersonate Jack's voice again.  Jack however gave him a mandolin and
taught him to play it, which he became even better at than his
singing.  Given more freedom and money from tips he started exploring
the city, and taking jobs at other inns and taverns as well, he tried
to learn all he could, especially about his ancestry.

He tracked down the enclave of Kenku in Shadowshore, but they found
him little like themselves, dirty dull skulking birds, where he was a
shiny fop with no sense.  They made fun of him, stole all he had,
including his clothes and turned him out.  He made it out of alive but
beaten and rejected, and vowed never to have dealings with his own
kind again.  He went back to his old foster mother Ruby, and she
tended him until he recovered.  His mother seeded him with enough
money to buy some things to get his life started up again.  Instead of
spending it evenly, he found a famed Baur Mandolin for sale at the
Dancing Monkey, and bought that as well as a used jester's suit
spending all the money his mother had given.

Ori is a bird, although flightless, and has the mannerisms of one,
quick head movements, and a nearly unblinking piercing stare from one
side of his face as he looks at someone.  He loves the limelight and
craves attention, and preens himself constantly to keep himself
looking his best.  He prefers fruit and shellfish but will eat grains,
enjoys wines and other fruit based alchohols, but distains carrion and
most meat.  All qualities opposite those of most Kenku, who stick to
the shadows, prefer anonymity, are dirty, dull, with no manners, smell
bad, eat mostly rotten food, long dead animals, and other things
associated with animal scavengers.  Even Kenku's strong family ties
are lost to Ori, as his family is everyone in the city, often
unreachable, or unavailable.  Because of this Ori craves the close
relationships that his is missing from his family and goes out of his
way to please others, and wants everyone to like him.  This goes so
far as want what could otherwise be called stardom.  He seeks fame
above all else, but still feels unsatisfied when he gets it, this
fuels a bit of wanderlust to seek out something else, another
challenge, new friends, and excitement.  What he really wants is a
close family, but he doesn't understand this himself.  He also has an
unsatisfied need to find where he actually came from, who are his
parents, but he is afraid at the same time especially after his
encounter with the local Kenku.  His worst fear is being ignored and
alone, even ridicule or negative attention from the worst sort is
better than nothing.

He currently seeks favor with the Seekers both since they are his
closest family, and for the information and wanderlust he experiences,
and perhaps to pay them back, not to mention the life suits him. He
also seems to have an interest in shiny objects common to many birds
which the seekers share to some extent.  He nominally worships
Fharlanghn and Celestion since they are the patrons of wanderers.

The first most noticeable thing about Ori is that his head is that of
a very large raven, and his hands and feet are the talons of the
same.  His shiny black feathers are iridescent purple on his head and
green on the body in strong light.  He has a black beak.  He obviously
cares well for his appearance.  His yellow eyes stare back with the
intensity only a bird could have.  He wears red gi with yellow trim,
embroidered with symbols for good luck, health, and prosperity, an
argyle vest, and an overturned cup for a hat. He carries a mandolin
which he is most likely softly strumming and humming along with while
whipping his head left and right in time to view his audience with
each eye, and tapping one foot.
