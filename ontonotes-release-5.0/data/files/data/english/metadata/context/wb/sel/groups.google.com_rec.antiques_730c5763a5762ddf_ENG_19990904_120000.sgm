Hello Everyone,

I'm new to this NG and online auctions. Having very recently made a
few small purchases through the eBay site I'm interested in knowing
how others in the UK manage when importing goods bought this way with
regard to import duty and VAT - sorry to use such disgusting words on
a public forum &lt;G&gt;.

The information I have so far is rather vague. Are imported antiques
subject to these taxes and is there a value under which they are tax
free?

I'd be grateful for any advice.

Regards,

Chris

"/> Are you VAT registered??

If not, then you can't claim the VAT, but you may be able to claim the
import tax, duty or VAT as a personal import. Easier if it's another EU
member.

Best to contact your local VAT office and/or HM Custom &amp; Excise.

Antiques and/or &quot;works of arts&quot; have their own schedule under the VAT
scheme, usually a Zero rate will applies. ie: antique=100years, work of
art, if under a 100years old, should be signed or attributable, this
sometimes is sticky point and you may have to argue the point with
Customs.

The VAT office has an appropriate help leaflet explaining the full
schedule and scope. HM Custom &amp; Excise have similar explaining personal
importation.

They will not be vague. It really depends if you're a business of a
private.

"/> Have a look at HM Customs and Excise:

http://www.hmce.gov.uk/

The site has everything you'll get in various booklets, and more...

The good news; antiques are free of duty and VAT
The bad news; antiques need to be over 100 years old with a
certificate of authenticity to be recognised as such by HM Customs.

I understand items which were made in the UK can be re-imported with
relief from customs duty and VAT providing you can obtain a
Certificate of Origin.

Please mark this information as a gift, value 5 dollars :-)

"/> Mark, just one point, they are not FREE of VAT they are Zero rated, and
that may not always be the case, they are rated not exempt.

FWIW and slightly off the topic. In the UK homemakers, a 100 years old
object and/or works of art (less than 100 years old) can be sold under
the VAT scope of the special scheme. That means, if the buyer is not
claiming VAT then the goods can be sold zero rated by the seller under
&quot;special scheme for antiques and works of art&quot;, and the registered VAT
seller will only pay VAT at 17.5% on his profit to the VAT office,
provided, he (the seller) bought the object in, at special scheme in the
first place. If he, OTHO, bought the goods in, at plus VAT, then he must
sell the goods out at plus VAT and pay the VAT office 17.5% on the FULL
selling price. Auction houses in the UK operate under special scheme.
That's why we only pay VAT on the auctioneers commission fees, which of
course he the auctioneer returns to the VAT office.

If the original poster is a private, and non-registered for VAT, then he
will have to import the objects as private use. His level of reoccurring
and frequency activity may well (or may well not) catch the eye of the
VAT people.

A friend of mine has just received a bill from the VAT squad for £18000
over several containers he brought in as private import and use, the VAT
people are not disputing the fact, and as such they don't have to PROVE
the case, he has to DISPROVE the case, if he can't then it's pay up
time. Extreme? yes, but a warning.

Thanks for all the info particularly Ronnies detailed overview and
that timely warning. Gosh...this is a veritable minefield!! And all
I wanted was to buy a few nice pieces over the internet. Ah
well...better to be safe than owing those dreaded VAT men a small
fortune somewhere down the line.

Luckily I'm not in it as a business, I just like collecting Moorcroft,
Clarice Cliff and Art Deco for my own pleasure. Part of the fun is
mooching around the fairs but having recently found online auctions, I
have become fascinated.

Cheers,

Chris

"/> Marshall, it is simply an indirect tax, much like a purchase tax (sales

general public and non-registered traders, the VAT rate being added to
the value of the goods or service sold. The different between the input
and output tax by the registered businesses is returned to the VAT office
or refunded by the VAT office, whatever the case, via a quarterly VAT
return. If a business (full time or part-time) exceeds a set threshold
on their turnover (I think at the moment £12500 in any one quarter of
£50000 in a year) they must register for VAT by law. It is also voluntary
and if the business is below the threshold they still can enter the VAT
scheme, so as to claim VAT refunds on business goods and expenses.

In the UK, value-added tax (VAT) raises about half as much as the
personal income tax, and together excise duties and VAT raise about
one-third of total tax revenue. We are UNPAID tax collectors for the
government. I believe in the States it's the other way around, purchase
tax (sales tax) is relatively unimportant and the main bulk of revenue
coming from direct tax?

Any the wiser? :)

"/> Chris, as a genuine private collector there shouldn't be any problems in
buying stuff say in America and having it shipped as a private import the
EU is even less of a problem. Simply, either give your nearest VAT office
a ring and explain the situation and they will clearly advise you or
better call in to your nearest VAT office (usually in the same building
as your local Inland Revenue) and have a word with one of the VAT
officers. They will give you all the help and all the forms you need, of
the top of my head, I think it is form 44 you need.

btw ... Moorcroft, Clarice Cliff and the like, whilst not qualifying as
100 year old antiques they would be covered under the VAT scheme as
&quot;works of art&quot; (that is a big scope and sometimes a loophole :&gt;) ... or
simply as private imports. Once you have completed a couple of
transactions the rest will be like falling of a log.

You can if you wish, have the goods sent as some other undervalued
factitious codswallop, that would be your decision, but if it goes wrong
the VAT people, can if they wish, come down on you like a ton of bricks.

Good luck

things. Need a little more red tape?

Sales taxes here are State (&amp; county) taxes, not federal. Most (but
not all) states also collect Income taxes. The states &amp; counties
would not agree with your assessment of sales tax being unimportant.

This quoted from the website someone so kindly posted the addy to:

&quot;Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced into the United Kingdom on 1
April 1973 at a standard rate of 10% and replaced Purchase Tax and
Selective Employment Tax. VAT is a tax on the final consumption of
certain goods and services in the home market but it is collected at
every stage of production and distribution.&quot;

Does this mean that they collect VAT every time a piece changes hands?
That seems a bit excessive (as does the current rate -- New York State
sales tax is 4%, my county adds another 3%.) The sales tax is ideally
only collected from the end consumer. Somehow they figure that
antiques &amp; other used goods that have been reintroduced to the market
need to get taxed again to the new end user. Anyone who purchases for
resale, or purchases materials to make things that they will sell,
does not have to pay sales tax.

As a retail seller in the states, I am also an unpaid sales tax
collector. If I sell (mail order) to a person in the UK, as I
understand it, the VAT is their problem to deal with? If I buy from
the UK (mail order to the US) does the VAT still need to be paid?

Ronnie, here it's almost the same except for which government gets the
money. &lt;g&gt;

States, counties and cities set a sales tax rate. If you're buying for
resale, you show them your Tax Number and they don't charge you tax.
Otherwise, the dealer charges you tax, then passes it on to the state
who figures out which county and city get how much.

Out-of-state sales are also (currently) tax exempt, although most states
have a Use Tax which the purchaser of out-of-state goods is supposed to
send in to the state. Most do not, but large companies who get audited
could find themselves owing the state a bundle in tax for all their mail
order office supplies and such.

Now, WHAT is taxable, depends on the state. In NJ, they don't tax the
necessities of life (food, clothing, medicine) or services (doctors,
lawyers); in NM, everything is taxable; in FL, service isn't nor is food
unless it's things like soda. In NJ, the &quot;necessities&quot; rule is a little
absurd... seeds to grow veggies isn't, but seeds to grow flowers is,
while bath soap is, flea soap (medicine) for your dog isn't.

NJ also had the strangest &quot;blue laws&quot; on the books: you couldn't buy a
toaster on a Sunday, but you could buy a refrigerator. You could buy
clothes, but not the fabric to sew your own. The end result is that most
stores used to close on Sundays, but eventually the stores lost money to
nearby states (especially during Christmas buying season), and most of
the laws were repealed (although I think you can still only buy beer and
wine, but not liquor on Sundays unless you drink it in the bar).

Have fun, Michele

"/> VAT applies across all regions of the UK and is the same rate/s. Ireland
(ROI) has a similar VAT scheme as does the other EU countries. The object

in all EU countries, along with a common currency and all the rest of the
bullshit that they purpose.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Does this mean that they collect VAT every time a piece changes hands?

"/> More or less yes. BUT it's an INPUT and OUTPUT tax for a registered
business, must bear that in mind. If you are not registered or are a Joe
Public then in most cases you cannot reclaim the VAT. There are some
exceptions to this, which I will not go into.

Take a manufacture, he sells his product to the wholesaler at XXX plus
VAT. The wholesaler sells to a retailer at XXX (plus their profit) plus
VAT. The retailer sells to Joe Public at XXX (plus his profit) plus VAT.

The manufacture, wholesaler and retailer can offset the input VAT they
were charged when they bought the goods in, against the output VAT they
added when they sold, so really the only one actually paying VAT is Joe
Public. The businesses are collecting tax from Joe Public. The
manufacture would of course be entitled to offset the VAT charged on his
raw materials used in the manufacture of the product against his output
tax to the wholesaler, or who ever he sells to. Services are also subject
to VAT. Businesses (registered for VAT) can reclaim all VAT on anything
against their business either capital expenditure or business expenses.
In essence, it's an end user or consumer tax paid at the end of the line,
the difference between input and output.

This is a rather simplified version but there are a number of VAT schemes
contained within the VAT scope for special trades and businesses.
Antiques is one these which I explained the last time, it has it's own
special scheme, as does other second-hand markets. The are certain items
and services that can be Zero rated (0%) and certain items and services
that are exempt (free from the VAT scheme) although government prefer to
Zero rate rather than apply exemptions, for obvious reasons.

It is not really a complicated system, it may sound a bit complex on
paper but is easy worked in practice. However, it's bloody unfair.
Originally, antiques were meant to have the full VAT added to the selling
price, this was fought by a number of antique trade associations and was
replaced with the special scheme for antiques. In which the **dealer**
pay VAT on his profit, the same as the auctions. Talk recently was that
the EU wished to add VAT to the hammer price at auction, personally I
think that is a bloody good idea, for obvious reasons, if you have
followed my above explanation of the VAT scheme.;&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I sell (mail order) to a person in the UK, as I
&gt;understand it, the VAT is their problem to deal with?

"/> I would assume so, however, you would be exporting, so I think you would
need to supply certain custom paper work at you end. It is then up to the
UK import to deal with VAT refund, for a business not really a problem as
most would use a shipping agent that would take care of all the custom
and excise needs. A private needs to bring it in (strictly) as a
&quot;personal import.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I buy from
&gt;the UK (mail order to the US) does the VAT still need to be paid?

"/> It depends, most retailers that mail order to the States will have all
the paper work completed and the goods should then be Zero rate VAT. How
your customs deal with it, ie: do then apply sales tax? which in turn you
as an American have to reclaim? .. I don't know.

At one time it was the exporting countries VAT that applied and this
would then have to be reclaimed, now I believe it is the port of entry.

An example to that. A number of years ago, the ROI (Southern Ireland) had
a VAT rate of 26% .. if I brought something in from the ROI I paid their
rate of VAT then reclaimed it, not a problem, except for large companies
it screwed up their cash flow. But as I say that has changed, as well as
the VAT being more or less the same across the EU and converging.

Clear as mud this time? :))

If any USians here do travel to europe, you can avoid paying VAT tax on some
major purchases by showing your passport. Some places - those with a large
tourist customer base - will not charge you the VAT at all. Others will simply
give you a receipt that you can use to get the VAT refunded. There is a way of
doing so at major airports, but in generally takes more time figuring out where
to go and standing in line then you have to spare before your plane leaves.

"/> This is true Susan and I did gloss over than in one of my previous posts.
Anyone residing in North America (or indeed outside of the EU) can do a
personal export from the UK/Ireland and other EU centres. Many large
retail stores in Ireland for example, will take care of all this on the
tourist's behalf. Sellers of modern Waterford glass and Belleek will
arrange in most cases everything for the US visitor, including shipping,
customs and details regarding VAT. They even display signs in their shop
windows advising US and other tourist of this fact and offered service.
Your goods will simply arrive on your doorstep back in the States.
Overpriced yes, but that's another story. :))))

btw ... not many antique dealers will get involved with that type of
service, usually leaving it up to the US tourist themselves.

"/> Not just antique dealers. Stores without a big tourist customer base and names
like CASH'S IRISH HOUSE OF BLARNEY will usually collect the VAT tax and let the
USian deal with trying to get a refund.

Unless it is a great deal of money, most people decide to spend their last
couple of hours at the airport having a stiff drink or shopping at the
duty-free, rather then bothering with the paperwork involved. I sure did.

&gt;&gt;Ronnie, I first ran into value added tax a long time ago on the price
&gt;&gt;sticker for a Jaguar at an Italian auto show. I was puzzled then, and
&gt;&gt;I got some kind of explanation that I didn't understand (although I
&gt;&gt;nodded politely). But I still don't understand the reference. What
&gt;&gt;does &quot;value added&quot; mean?

&gt;Marshall, it is simply an indirect tax, much like a purchase tax (sales
&gt;tax). Currently there are two rates, Zero rate and a rate of 17.5%, some
&gt;good are exempt, fewer exempts these days. It's an input and output tax.
&gt;The tax is collected by VAT registered businesses and services from the
&gt;general public and non-registered traders, the VAT rate being added to
&gt;the value of the goods or service sold. The different between the input
&gt;and output tax by the registered businesses is returned to the VAT office
&gt;or refunded by the VAT office, whatever the case, via a quarterly VAT
&gt;return. If a business (full time or part-time) exceeds a set threshold
&gt;on their turnover (I think at the moment £12500 in any one quarter of
&gt;£50000 in a year) they must register for VAT by law. It is also voluntary
&gt;and if the business is below the threshold they still can enter the VAT
&gt;scheme, so as to claim VAT refunds on business goods and expenses.

&gt;In the UK, value-added tax (VAT) raises about half as much as the
&gt;personal income tax, and together excise duties and VAT raise about
&gt;one-third of total tax revenue. We are UNPAID tax collectors for the
&gt;government. I believe in the States it's the other way around, purchase
&gt;tax (sales tax) is relatively unimportant and the main bulk of revenue
&gt;coming from direct tax?

&gt;Any the wiser? :)

It's a tax on the amount by which the value of an article has been
increased at each stage of its production. Three major types of
value-added tax, depending on the deductions allowed, but only one called
the &quot;consumption&quot; type is widely used today. The type of value-added tax
in the UK and the EU countries is the &quot;consumption&quot; type.

Calculation of the value-added tax of the consumption type can be made in
any of three different ways, but virtually every country imposing the tax
uses the &quot;invoice&quot; or &quot;credit&quot; method of computation. Using this method,
each seller (the party responsible for collecting the tax and paying it
to the government) first calculates the sum of all the taxes that he has
collected on goods sold, he then totals the sum of all the taxes that he
has paid on goods purchased. His net tax liability is the difference
between the tax collected and the tax paid.

Does this make any sense?

btw .. I believe the US state of Michigan used a value-added tax at one
time .... maybe they still do?

I don't think any state in the US has a VAT, but I can't be sure. It's the sort
of thing that gets proposed every few years, a VAT, a national sales tax, a flat
tax, etc..., usually with the promise that it will replace some other form of
tax. Most people end up afraid that it will be an additional tax instead of a
replacement, and these changes usually fail. Who would imagine, taxpayers in
the US don't trust their elected officials to do what they promise. To quote
Mark Twain, &quot;It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no
distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.&quot;

"/> VAT returns as usually made quarterly, a simple form, if there is VAT
held by the business, after calculating the difference between input and
output tax, a cheque is sent to the VAT office along with the return
form. If OTOH, a refund is due by the VAT office, then the VAT office
will despatch the refund usually within the week after receiving your VAT
return from.Normally there shouldn't be a refund, for obvious reasons.
Large firms will have the advantage, with the collected VAT until the
quarterly VAT return is due, provided they have an efficient cash flow
with good credit control. :)

Marshall-here are a couple sentences from a book I have.

&quot;In economics this transformation has a name: &quot;value added&quot;. Value added
derives from all the processes that alter a raw material from something
that has no intrinsic value to something which does. Each change in
form, say, from iron ore in the ground to iron to steel to car to car
which is heavily advertised adds value to the material.&quot;

It's just an economics term. But hey, everybody knows the meaning. Why
else do we dress in nice clothes, wear makeup, perfume, cologne, have
different hairstyles, wear rings, watches etc. Value added!!

&gt;Michigan has both use and sales taxes at the rate of 6% although food
&gt;for &quot;home/human&quot; consumption is exempt, as are, I believe, prescript-

&gt;$1.00 in Indiana. Indiana is less than an hour away from where I live.
&gt;Indiana's gasoline prices are regularly $ .07 to $ .15 less than in
&gt;Michigan. Conveniently. Of course, &quot;smuggling&quot; of cigarettes is a
&gt;felony, so I don't do it. Liquor is also cheaper in Indiana,
&gt;significantly so, I have been told. I don't do that either.

I believe VAT is applied only to certain products. In Illinois, I

"/> Thank you Charley, nice to see you know what is happening on the street
where you live.

You may recall a value-added tax also existed in state of Michigan from
1953 through 1967 and as you say, reintroduced again in 1975. I didn't
know for sure that it was still the case. I believe this value-added tax
in the state of Michigan is also a consumption type.

&gt;&gt;&gt;don't know about Michigan; maybe somebody here does.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Marshall

&gt;&gt;I've lived in Michigan my whole life, and there has been no VAT tax
&gt;&gt;per se. There is a personal property tax, mostly ignored (since most
&gt;&gt;counties aren't aware of what to do or how to do it). There may be a
&gt;&gt;wishy-washy variation of VAT in that a manufacturer keeps track of
&gt;&gt;inventory by raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Of
&gt;&gt;course that information is obviously necessary for the P&amp;L statement.
&gt;&gt;However, IIRC, it is also this particular kind of &quot;personal property&quot;
&gt;&gt;which does receive close attention, and tax may be levied on the
&gt;&gt;&quot;value added.&quot; That is part of the reason why all finished goods that
&gt;&gt;*can* be shipped are, in fact, shipped. If the carrier has a bill of
&gt;&gt;lading, and the truck moves only a few feet from the shipping dock,
&gt;&gt;it is counted as shipped, and no tax is due. Also, all the crap that has
&gt;&gt;accumulated here and there and is of no reasonable use or value
&gt;&gt;is scrapped. It has happened more than a few times, that a manu-
&gt;&gt;facturer loaded semis (lorries) with taxable goods and the drivers

Hi Gang-
As I've waded through the Dismal Swamp that used to be the Discussion Group
Rec.antiques I had the feeling that I had been in this muck before. Sure
enough, pasted below is a posting of mine retrieved from Deja News and posted
in June of 1997. Back then we were still dealing with persons intent on turning
R.A into their own Ad space, and a while before there were many instances of
good contributors being driven out of the group by those that saw it as a
chance to grab the spotlight for their own ego boost. They would ramble on
about non-antique issues and trash any newbies that dared to ask a question. In
finding this quote I also saw a virtual roll call of good solid suppliers of
advice that have given up. Here's June 18, 1997:

As a semi-lurker that visits this group on at least a daily basis, my view is
that this place was to be a relaxed lounge where we could discuss and also view
others opinions and advice on issues about collecting antiques, problems of
finding restoration sources or historic references, and in general enjoy the
fellowship of those with a common interest. These types of groups are patterned
after their real world counterparts where collectors and dealers often
congregate at a local watering hole after a show and discuss the hobby with a
gentleperson's (pc) agreement that this is a time to unwind and not to market
and those that seem unable to keep handbills, business cards, flyers in their
pockets are usually shunned, laughed at, or decorated with some stray stale
beer until they get the message. When attending most professional seminars and
association meetings the same &quot;No Solicitation&quot; manners apply. That's why
you're getting these hostile reactions- if we wanted to hear the din of
commerce we know hundreds of places to go but we should have the right to find
a place where we have mutually agreed to put the sales book away, put our feet
up on the furniture and relax. Having found that and agreed on the rules tacked
on the door as the price of admission, we welcome all to sit by the fire and
swap tales and woes &quot;All very large, because nobody ever brought anything small
in a bar&quot; (Elwood Dowd, in Harvey)

as you said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I guess that has contributed to my attitude. All the complaining about
&gt;commercial posts seem to be coming from a small group of individuals
&gt;which
&gt;seem to be speaking for the masses. So how about it all you lurkers let's
&gt;hear your opinion &amp; maybe we can put this thread to rest. Luck &amp; Success

Nothing's really changed except the perversion of the group has accelerated out
of control over the last month; several have noticed I've been absent, as have
lots of others with some decent antiques experience. I have 40 years of
collecting experience and almost as many years dealing. We've left because the
price of staying around has gotten too high, both in on-screen arguments and
nasty private e-mail. I'll probably lurk around for a while to see how things
go, but the only things I've seen deteriorate faster than R.A. were the&quot;
Tailgunner Joe (McCarthy) For President&quot; Committee and the Nixon Truth Squad.&quot;
And look who they were supporting!

Reading R.A. before bedtime used to be calming and planting seeds for things to

there are at least a dozen here who miss Charley and what he added to this
group. Unfortunately, it seems those with real knowledge are often spit upon
by those who have little.
My anger bubbles up when I see a relative newbie telling one of our
regular and valuable contributors to go off and start their own private club if
they can't be nice, waa, waa, waa. Maybe that is what Charley did?
Hope that answers your question sufficiently, Marshall.

I haven't waded through the entire 40 posts in this thread so perhaps this has
already been mentioned. Don't we still have a luxury tax in the USA on the
more expensive items such as boats, expensive cars, motorhomes, etc? It seems
to me this would be similar to VAT in that it is a way for the states to raise
extra revenue.

&gt;I don't think any state in the US has a VAT, but I can't be sure. It's the

&gt;a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a tax on the amount by which the value of an article has been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increased at each stage of its production. Three major types of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;value-added tax, depending on the deductions allowed, but only one
&gt;called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;consumption&quot; type is widely used today. The type of value-added tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the UK and the EU countries is the &quot;consumption&quot; type.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Calculation of the value-added tax of the consumption type can be made
&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any of three different ways, but virtually every country imposing the
&gt;tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;uses the &quot;invoice&quot; or &quot;credit&quot; method of computation. Using this method,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;each seller (the party responsible for collecting the tax and paying it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the government) first calculates the sum of all the taxes that he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;collected on goods sold, he then totals the sum of all the taxes that he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has paid on goods purchased. His net tax liability is the difference
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;between the tax collected and the tax paid.

I thought the luxury tax was federal??? I recall hearing a few years ago
that the handicap accessible mini-vans were being taxed because of their
cost, and those with disabilities were trying to get them exempt from
the tax... so I think it's still in effect.

Have fun, Michele

this has

&gt;&gt;I don't think any state in the US has a VAT, but I can't be sure.
It's the
&gt;&gt;sort
&gt;&gt;of thing that gets proposed every few years, a VAT, a national sales
tax, a
&gt;&gt;flat
&gt;&gt;tax, etc..., usually with the promise that it will replace some other
form of
&gt;&gt;tax. Most people end up afraid that it will be an additional tax
instead of
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;replacement, and these changes usually fail. Who would imagine,
taxpayers in
&gt;&gt;the US don't trust their elected officials to do what they promise.

Hi,

In Sweden I think there is a luxury tax on how big
your house is and what it has in it like wooden floors
will cost you as well as any fireplaces. I forget
what else was included in the luxury tax.

Regards,

Kat

The luxury tax was federal, not state, and it applied to the part of
the purchase price above, I believe, $32,000. It hit the boatmakers
particularly hard, and I believe it was finally rescinded. I know, at
least, that there were mighty efforts in that direction.
