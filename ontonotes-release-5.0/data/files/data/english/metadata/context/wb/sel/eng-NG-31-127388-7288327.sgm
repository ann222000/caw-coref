I've got a design going where I'm using mirror-bright stainless, and was
planning to rivet these 3 parts together - one .093 or so, one .125, and
another .093, in sort of a stack.

The client suggested spot welding.

Is that even possible with that really shiny stuff? I do know that if
I can make a reliable weld, I'll have to do something about the dimples.

Thanks,
Rich

Do you have a huge water-cooled spotwelder? If so, maybe. If not, riveting
sounds great to me.

What kind of spot weld are you referring to? Tig, Mig, resistance? Any of
the spot processes should work but you will need something pretty hefty for
your .125 material.

Resistance-type, i.e, the big copper clamp type, apparently water-cooled. ;-)

I'll let the client know what both of you have said.

Thanks!
