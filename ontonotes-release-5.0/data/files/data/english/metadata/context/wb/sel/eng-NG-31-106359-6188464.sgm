You seem to think in terms of some "magic" routine which will fill
your legs.  There is none.  Simple stuff done often enough, intense
enough, and for long enough is what's working.  Neither squats nor
leg presses are an absolute necessity.  If there was a competition in
leg curls you bet that champs would have some huge hams.

Not much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I cannot do them because of my stiff ankle from an old injury.  I

Persist, and you'll learn the necessary skill.

&gt; I was doing leg
&gt; extensions for a bit but I don't think the movement is really the
&gt; same.  Now I think I am going to give hack squats a try.  Not sure if
&gt; using a barbell or machine is better.  I noticed a weakness in this
&gt; area when I tried doing wall squats with no weight.

&gt; My legs are still weak but the weight is coming up.   I think I am
&gt; going to add more leg focus into my next routine to help bring my
&gt; squat weight up faster.  I am just looking for something which is
&gt; going to cover all the bases.   My body still has a few weakness
&gt; effecting the my form and these stand out more as I raise the weight.

&gt; Any suggestions?
">

Do not search for a magic bullet.  All exercises are bullets, but none
of them are magic.  How about simply persisting in doing what you can
do?

One suggestion.  If you can't keep your form with high weights,
increase the number of sets and/or the frequency of your workouts.
Think in terms of weekly load.  More load means more stress.  It
should result in faster adaptation, until you are past your ability
to adapt to it.

&gt; Not magic.  I just think there are certain target areas or exercise
&gt; crucial to development and strength.  For instance I don't think a
&gt; routine of leg curls and extensions provide optimum leg development.
&gt; They can work as a supplement but I don't think they work well on
&gt; their own.
">

So imagine that there exist a sport where you need good total in leg
curls and extensions to win.  Would guys who are good at it have big
legs?  Would they concentrate their efforts on doing extensions and
curls, or on doing squats?  I bet that they would mainly do the
"competition lifts" and still have some seriously big legs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It was taking far too long to learn.  I need to stick to the stuff
&gt; which works right  now.

Good idea.

&gt;&gt;to adapt to it.

&gt; I have already done that and moved my squat weight up about 35 pounds
&gt; in the past two months.  I want to bring it up at least another 30 for
&gt; a satisfactory number.   Except all my other lifts have been going up
&gt; at the same pace so I still bench with more than I squat.    So my new
&gt; plan is to increase the number of days and/or exercises for my legs.
&gt; With some luck that will accelerate them past my upper body strength.
">

Seems like a plan.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My form isn't too bad.  I just notice that I still move too far
&gt; forward sometimes on the way up.  It isn't to the point where it hurts
&gt; my back or anything.  But I can sometimes feel myself pulling forward
&gt; onto my toes.  I thought hack or front squats might help me learn to
&gt; keep my back straight.
">

They might help.  But now it looks like you aren't much concerned with
your muscular development, and more with your numbers.  It's not the
same.  Finding a weakness and fixing it with specific exercise can help
your number, but it most probably will not influence the rate of muscular
growth in your legs by much.

Anyway, I'd simply squat more often.  Vary the weights, reps and intensity
during your workouts, but do not forget about your main lift in favor of
an assistance lift.  Assistance is just that, an exercise which is supposed
to assist you in reaching your goal.

&gt; I was thinking doing the alternate exercises on a separate training
&gt; day would give my legs a little bit of a break.  It takes about four
&gt; days for them to recover from the squat routine.

There is no must in going heavy on every workout.  You might squat more
often, but with different weight and rep range, and with different focus.
If you want to squat more, you must squat more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I need to squeeze deadlifts in there somewhere too.

Between squats and deadlifts, both done say twice a week, you should
have absolutely no gas for upper body workouts.  Soon enough you'll
reach those magic "proportional" numbers. ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The routine I was thinking
&gt; of doing is a pyramid which varies the weight quite a bit.  I haven't
&gt; done one before so I am expecting good results.

&gt; BTW someone helped me on my deadlift form the other day.  I didn't
&gt; realize I wasn't dropping my butt back down in between lifts.  I think
&gt; I am finally reaching weights where people notice.  It starts to stand
&gt; once I can slap on that extra plate.

Nice that you get where you want to be.  Congratulations.

&gt; Well I was planning to use a pyramid with some high and some low reps.
&gt; I am hoping that will give me a bit of a break but keep me advancing
&gt; although maybe a bit slower.  I also want to focus on my legs which my
&gt; weakest link.  Then in a few months I am going to hit myself with much
&gt; more brutal strength routine.  I want to be comfortable with my
&gt; current weights before I start it.

&gt; I was using these weights for sets of 4 last workout:
&gt; bench 200
&gt; squat 185
&gt; deadlift 225
">

Yours are in pounds, obviously. The following are in kgs:

Bench: 8 x 120kg
Squat: 3 x 160kg
Deadlift: 2 x 200kg, 1 x 210kg

Keep up, will you!!!
