How
to create an Angry American — puppetgovcom, Wed Sep 19 20:04

Congressman Ron Paul
U.S. House of Representatives
June 27, 2002

( Is) America a Police State?
Mr. Speaker:
Most Americans believe we live in dangerous times, and I must
agree. Today I
want to talk about how I see those dangers and what Congress ought to
do about
them.
Of course, the Monday-morning quarterbacks are now explaining,
with political
overtones, what we should have done to prevent the 9/11 tragedy.
Unfortunately,
in doing so, foreign policy changes are never considered.
I have, for more than two decades, been severely critical of our
post-World
War II foreign policy. I have perceived it to be not in our best
interest and
have believed that it presented a serious danger to our security.
For the record, in January of 2000 I stated the following on
this floor:
Our commercial interests and foreign policy are no longer
separate...as
bad as it is that average Americans are forced to subsidize such a
system, we
additionally are placed in greater danger because of our arrogant
policy of
bombing nations that do not submit to our wishes. This generates hatred
directed
toward America ...and exposes us to a greater threat of terrorism,
since this is
the only vehicle our victims can use to retaliate against a powerful
military
state...the cost in terms of lost liberties and unnecessary exposure to
terrorism is difficult to assess, but in time, it will become apparent
to all of
us that foreign interventionism is of no benefit to American citizens,
but
instead is a threat to our liberties.
Again, let me remind you I made these statements on the House
floor in
January 2000. Unfortunately, my greatest fears and warnings have been
borne out.
I believe my concerns are as relevant today as they were then.
We should move
with caution in this post-9/11 period so we do not make our problems
worse
overseas while further undermining our liberties at home.
So far our post-9/11 policies have challenged the rule of law
here at home,
and our efforts against the al Qaeda have essentially come up
empty-handed. The
best we can tell now, instead of being in one place, the members of the
al Qaeda
are scattered around the world, with more of them in allied Pakistan
than in
Afghanistan. Our efforts to find our enemies have put the CIA in 80
different
countries. The question that we must answer some day is whether we can
catch
enemies faster than we make new ones. So far it appears we are losing.
As evidence mounts that we have achieved little in reducing the
terrorist
threat, more diversionary tactics will be used. The big one will be to
blame
Saddam Hussein for everything and initiate a major war against Iraq,
which will
only generate even more hatred toward America from the Muslim world.
But, Mr. Speaker, my subject today is whether America is a
police state. I'm
sure the large majority of Americans would answer this in the negative.
Most
would associate military patrols, martial law and summary executions
with a
police state, something obviously not present in our everyday
activities.
However, those with knowledge of Ruby Ridge, Mount Carmel and other
such
incidents may have a different opinion.
The principal tool for sustaining a police state, even the most
militant, is
always economic control and punishment by denying disobedient citizens
such
things as jobs or places to live, and by levying fines and
imprisonment. The
military is more often used in the transition phase to a totalitarian
state.
Maintenance for long periods is usually accomplished through economic
controls
on commercial transactions, the use of all property, and political
dissent.
Peaceful control through these efforts can be achieved without storm
troopers on
our street corners.
Terror and fear are used to achieve complacency and obedience,
especially
when citizens are deluded into believing they are still a free people.
The
changes, they are assured, will be minimal, short-lived, and necessary,
such as
those that occur in times of a declared war. Under these conditions,
most
citizens believe that once the war is won, the restrictions on their
liberties
will be reversed. For the most part, however, after a declared war is
over, the
return to normalcy is never complete. In an undeclared war, without a
precise
enemy and therefore no precise ending, returning to normalcy can prove
illusory.
We have just concluded a century of wars, declared and
undeclared, while at
the same time responding to public outcries for more economic equity.
The
question, as a result of these policies, is: &quot;Are we already living
in a police state?&quot; If we are, what are we going to do about it? If we
are
not, we need to know if there's any danger that we're moving in that
direction.
Most police states, surprisingly, come about through the
democratic process
with majority support. During a crisis, the rights of individuals and
the
minority are more easily trampled, which is more likely to condition a
nation to
become a police state than a military coup. Promised benefits initially
seem to
exceed the cost in dollars or lost freedom. When people face terrorism
or great
fear- from whatever source- the tendency to demand economic and
physical
security over liberty and self-reliance proves irresistible. The masses
are
easily led to believe that security and liberty are mutually exclusive,
and
demand for security far exceeds that for liberty.
Once it's discovered that the desire for both economic and
physical security
that prompted the sacrifice of liberty inevitably led to the loss of
prosperity
and no real safety, it's too late. Reversing the trend from
authoritarian rule
toward a freer society becomes very difficult, takes a long time, and
entails
much suffering. Although dissolution of the Soviet empire was
relatively
non-violent at the end, millions suffered from police suppression and
economic
deprivation in the decades prior to 1989.
But what about here in the United States? With respect to a
police state,
where are we and where are we going?
Let me make a few observations:
Our government already keeps close tabs on just about everything
we do and
requires official permission for nearly all of our activities.
One might take a look at our Capitol for any evidence of a
police state. We
see: barricades, metal detectors, police, military soldiers at times,
dogs, ID
badges required for every move, vehicles checked at airports and
throughout the
Capitol. The people are totally disarmed, except for the police and the
criminals. But worse yet, surveillance cameras in Washington are
everywhere to
ensure our safety.
The terrorist attacks only provided the cover for the do-gooders
who have
been planning for a long time before last September to monitor us &quot;for
our
own good.&quot; Cameras are used to spy on our drug habits, on our kids at
school, on subway travelers, and on visitors to every government
building or
park. There's not much evidence of an open society in Washington, DC,
yet most
folks do not complain- anything goes if it's for government-provided
safety and
security.
If this huge amount of information and technology is placed in
the hands of
the government to catch the bad guys, one naturally asks, What's the
big deal?
But it should be a big deal, because it eliminates the enjoyment of
privacy that
a free society holds dear. The personal information of law-abiding
citizens can
be used for reasons other than safety- including political reasons.
Like gun
control, people control hurts law-abiding citizens much more than the
law-breakers.
Social Security numbers are used to monitor our daily
activities. The numbers
are given at birth, and then are needed when we die and for everything
in
between. This allows government record keeping of monstrous
proportions, and
accommodates the thugs who would steal others' identities for criminal
purposes.
This invasion of privacy has been compounded by the technology now
available to
those in government who enjoy monitoring and directing the activities
of others.
Loss of personal privacy was a major problem long before 9/11.
Centralized control and regulations are required in a police
state. Community
and individual state regulations are not as threatening as the monolith
of rules
and regulations written by Congress and the federal bureaucracy. Law
and order
has been federalized in many ways and we are moving inexorably in that
direction.
Almost all of our economic activities depend upon receiving the
proper
permits from the federal government. Transactions involving guns, food,
medicine, smoking, drinking, hiring, firing, wages, politically correct
speech,
land use, fishing, hunting, buying a house, business mergers and
acquisitions,
selling stocks and bonds, and farming all require approval and strict
regulation
from our federal government. If this is not done properly and in a
timely
fashion, economic penalties and even imprisonment are likely
consequences.
Because government pays for much of our health care, it's
conveniently argued
that any habits or risk-taking that could harm one's health are the
prerogative
of the federal government, and are to be regulated by explicit rules to
keep
medical-care costs down. This same argument is used to require helmets
for
riding motorcycles and bikes.
Not only do we need a license to drive, but we also need special
belts, bags,
buzzers, seats and environmentally dictated speed limits- or a
policemen will be
pulling us over to levy a fine, and he will be toting a gun for sure.
The states do exactly as they're told by the federal government,
because they
are threatened with the loss of tax dollars being returned to their
state-
dollars that should have never been sent to DC in the first place, let
alone
used to extort obedience to a powerful federal government.
Over 80,000 federal bureaucrats now carry guns to
make us toe the line and to
enforce the thousands of laws and tens of thousands of regulations that
no one
can possibly understand. We don't see the guns, but we all know they're
there,
and we all know we can't fight &quot;City Hall,&quot; especially if it's
&quot;Uncle Sam.&quot;

&quot;Today, we need a
nation of
Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared to take arms, but
citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic purpose of
their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice
for that freedom.&quot;
