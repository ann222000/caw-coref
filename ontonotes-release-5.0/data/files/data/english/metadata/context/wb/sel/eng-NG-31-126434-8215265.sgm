Emotions

Voicing my emotions;
anger, fear, and doubt
is essential to my growth today,
I've got to let them out!
or else they'll fester,
up inside of me.
That's why I've got to talk about them
or else I won't be free.
Gratitude is nice to have,
unconditional love's the bomb.
Humility, faith, and acceptance
my foundation's built upon.
But that's only part of
all the feelings inside me.
I've got to talk about the other ones
so that I can be free.
Sure, its nice to share at meetings
of all the good things in my life.
But I'm thankful I've got a place to go
to also share my strife!
That is a blessing
I didn't have out there.
I let those feelings overtake me
because I lacked a place to share.
So when I'm feeling lonely
lost, or in a rage
I don't have to let those feelings
keep me in their cage.
I can express them,
take their power away.
And find you have the same feelings too,
thank God for our N.A.!

© John Hathaway 7-14-02
Much love, joy, and all those other crazy emotions,
john ... @yahoo.com

When I came into the rooms the only emotions I could
identify with were anger, fear, resentments and
despair. Just because I'm clean, doesn't mean these
feelings cease. I'm just glad that I've got a place I
can talk about them now, and the tools to help keep me
from acting out on them.

Just For Today
July 14                                                  An &quot;inside job&quot;

&quot;Social acceptability does not equal recovery.&quot; Basic Text, p.21

One of the first things that happens to many of us in recovery is that
we start to  look better. We get healthier; we bathe; we dress more
appropriately. And without the goading of active addiction, many of us
finally stop stealing, lying, and hustling.

We start to look normal-just by removing the drugs.

Looking normal is very different than being normal. Acceptability in
the eyes of the world is a benefit of recovery; it is not the same
thing as recovery. We can enjoy the benefits of recovery, but we
must take care to nurture their true source. Lasting recovery isn't
found in acceptance from others, but in the inner growth set in
motion by the Twelve Steps.

Just for today: I know that looking good isn't enough. Lasting
recovery is an inside job. pg. 204

The Best for Today

The principles we have set down are guides to progress.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 60

Just as a sculptor will use different tools to achieve desired effects in
creating a work of art, in Alcoholics Anonymous the Twelve Steps are used
to bring about results in my own life.  I do not overwhelm myself with
life's problems, and how much more work needs to be done.  I let myself be
comforted in knowing that my life is now in the hands of my Higher Power, a
master craftsman who is shaping each part of my life into a unique work of
art.  By working my program I can be satisfied, knowing that in the doing
the best that we can for today, we are doing all that God asks of us.&quot;

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden/ July 14th

A.A. Thought for the Day

One of the best things about the A.A. program is the peace of
mind and serenity that it can bring us. In our drinking days, we
had no peace of mind or serenity. We had the exact opposite,
a kind of turmoil and that &quot;quiet desperation&quot; we knew so well.
The turmoil of our drinking days was caused partly by our
physical suffering, the terrible hangovers, the cold sweats,
the shakes and the jitters. But it was caused even more by our
mental suffering, the loneliness, the feeling of inferiority, the
lying, and the remorse that every alcoholic understands. Have
I achieved more peace of mind?

Meditation for the Day

Try to look for God's leading in all your personal relationships,
in all your dealings with other persons. God will help you to take
care of all your relationships with people, if you are willing to
let Him guide you. Rejoice that God can protect you and keep
you from temptation and failure. God can protect you in all
situations during the day, if you will rely on His strength and
go forward. You should feel that you are entering upon the
stage of success in the proper way of living. You should not
doubt that better things are ahead for you. Go forward
unafraid because you feel deeply safe under God's protection.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that God may protect and keep me as long as I try to
serve Him. I pray that I may go forward today unafraid.

Today's Thought
JULY 14

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

We Are Lovable

Even if the most important person in your world rejects you, you are
still real, and you are still okay.
--Codependent No More

Do you ever find yourself thinking: How could anyone possibly love me? For
many of us, this is a deeply ingrained belief that can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

Thinking we are unlovable can sabotage our relationships with co-workers,
friends, family members, and other loved ones. This belief can cause us to
choose, or stay in, relationships that are less than we deserve because we
don't believe we deserve better. We may become desperate and cling as if a
particular person was our last chance at love. We may become defensive and
push people away. We may withdraw or constantly overreact.

While growing up, many of us did not receive the unconditional love we
deserved. Many of us were abandoned or neglected by important people in our
life. We may have concluded that the reason we weren't loved was because we
were unlovable. Blaming ourselves is an understandable reaction, but an
inappropriate one. If others couldn't love us, or love us in ways that
worked, that's not our fault. In recovery, we're learning to separate
ourselves from the behavior of others. And we're learning to take
responsibility for our healing, regardless of the people around us.

Just as we may have believed that we're unlovable, we can become skilled at
practicing the belief that we are lovable. This new belief will improve the
quality of our relationships. It will improve our most important
relationship: our relationship with our self. We will be able to let others
love us and become open to the love and friendship we deserve.

Today, God, help me be aware of and release any self-defeating beliefs I
have about being unlovable. Help me begin, today, to tell myself that I am
lovable. Help me practice this belief until it gets into my core and
manifests itself in my relationships.

Mistake Salad
by Alan Cohen

A mother seeking to inspire her young son to progress with his piano lessons
took him to a concert by the famed virtuoso Ignacy Paderewski. After the two
took their seats, mom noticed a friend a few aisles away, and went to chat
with her.

When mother returned, she discovered her son was missing from his seat. She
began to search for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Suddenly the house
lights dimmed, the curtains parted, and a spotlight shined on the gleaming
Steinway piano on stage.

There, to the woman's horror, she saw her little boy sitting at the
keyboard, innocently picking out the notes to &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little
Star.&quot;

Embarrassed beyond words, she began to rush to the stage to retrieve her
mischievous little musician. Before she could get there, however, the great
piano master emerged from a stage wing and approached the child. Paderewski
leaned over and whispered in the boy's ear, &quot;keep playing.&quot; Then he reached
his arms around the boy's and added a bass part with his left hand. With his
right hand Paderewski improvised a running obbligato. Together, the seasoned
master and the young novice turned a potential disaster into a triumph that
inspired everyone.

Are you so sure your mistakes are just mistakes? Or could they be building
blocks to a success beyond any you imagined?

When my friend Dorothy goes home to visit her family each Thanksgiving, her
mother serves the traditional &quot;mistake salad.&quot; The dish was born many years
ago, Dorothy explains, when her mother was using a cookbook to make a salad.
In the process, mother accidentally included half the salad ingredients from
a recipe on the left side of the open cookbook, and half the ingredients
from a different salad recipe on the opposite page. Everyone enjoyed the
salad so much that she continued to serve it every year. So it was really no
mistake at all.

Then there was the fellow named Alfred, who invented dynamite. When Alfred's
brother died, the city newspaper confused the two and printed an obituary
noting that the deceased's most notable act was the creation of the
explosive, subsequently adapted to manufacture bombs. Stunned to consider
that his name would forever be associated with destruction, Alfred sought to
leave a more positive legacy to humanity. So he instituted a prize for
people who contributed to world peace. Now the Nobel Prize, established by
Alfred Nobel, is the most coveted and respected award in the world.

Everything is part of something bigger, and mistakes are no exception. Every
minus is half of a plus, waiting for a stroke of vertical awareness. In his
brilliant book Illusions, Richard Bach explains that every problem comes to
you with a gift in its hands. If you focus only on what went wrong, you miss
the gift. If you are willing to look deeper and ask for the insight, the
problem dissipates, you are left only with the learning, and you advance on
your path.

Gallup conducted a poll asking people what was the worst thing that ever
happened to them. Then the pollsters asked the same people what was the best
thing that ever happened to them. The surveyors found an 80% correlation
between the worst and best experiences. Four out of five people reported
that the worst thing that ever happened to them turned out to be the best.

A Course in Miracles tells us, &quot;It takes great learning to understand that
all things, events, encounters and circumstances are helpful.&quot; The Course
also notes that trust is the bedrock of a true master's belief system. Trust
implies faith that there is a wiser plan afoot than the one that meets the
eye. Only the inner eye, the insight of higher wisdom, can make sense out of
apparent human error.

We all make mistakes, and plenty of them. Enlightenment does not ask you to
be perfect; it simply asks you to be open to a bigger picture that embraces
your humanity while rising above it. True perfection has space for
imperfection. Think of your life as a grand mosaic. When you examine your
acts with a magnifying glass, you see many flaws. Step back, and you
discover that every little piece has an important place in a grander design.
It is our belief in mistakes, and dwelling upon them, that makes them seem
more real than eternal love.

Within you is a child who wriggles off into unacceptable places. Also within
you is a Paderewski, a master who knows how to transform child's play into a
masterpiece. You can regret your errors, and those of others, or you can
honor them. At the very least, mistakes are opportunities to practice
forgiveness. At the most, they are invitations to acknowledge perfection.
Ultimately, real forgiveness means seeing good where others find fault. A
friend is someone who sees through you and still enjoys the view. You become
your own best friend when you do the same.

Salad, anyone?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*One Day At A Time*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I am writing this as a follow up to my writing that you published in the
newsletter in the daily meditations yahoo 12stepsoulfood group...
I have gotten so many responses that I feel the need to write this to
all of you with deep gratitude in my heart..

IS THIS DISEASE A GIFT OR A CURSE?
Hi Family this is Casey and for those who read my story that I wrote
back in April and was published this past week...Well I first want to
say thank you and how honored I was for all the feed back and emails...
Well since my writing in April I now am 45 yrs. young :) and now
celebrating this week my 11yrs clean... and have now added 2 more
surgeries to make it 14 of them now since the drunk driver hit me
August 3rd 1995....and my breast cancer is being the VICTIM
and I am now becoming the VICTOR....so I would like to talk to those
who are either new to our family with our disease of addiction and to
those who have many years....

IS THIS DISEASE A CURSE OR A GIFT????
When I was NEW
I Hated all of YOU
When I went to MEETINGS
I couldn't believe all the SEATINGS
When you all SHARED
I didn't want to HEAR
When you all spoke the SLOGANS
I resented sitting with you in our PROGRAM
When you spoke of our DISEASE
I felt so ill at EASE
When you said KEEP COMING BACK
I wanted to run and NEVER LOOK BACK
When you said 90 meetings in 90 DAYS
I was still in a HAZE
When you said the answers were in the 12 STEPS
I still couldn't ACCEPT

WAS I AN ADDICT?
I said NO WAY and COMPARED
SO IT HAS TAKEN YEARS
I said this DISEASE IS A CURSE
YOU ALL SAID NO just do the FIRST
I said FIRST?
you all said yes JUST ACCEPT
So I did my FIRST STEP
and now with my journey I am on
the 12th year AND THE 12 STEPS
as my way of life....
THE CURSE IS LIFTED
I AM NOW GIFTED
HOW YOU ALL WERE RIGHT
AND NOW I SEE THE LIGHT
I HAVE A GUIDE
the 12 STEPS is my way of LIFE

Well I can truly say now that I realized that there is no guide in life on
HOW TO BE A MOTHER OR A WIFE OR LOVER OR BROTHER OR FRIEND...
but with this DISEASE OF ADDICTION ....wow it is a GIFT...
I have the 12 steps to guide me on how to live life spiritually,
emotionally,
physically,,in all those categories and more..
AND I HAVE ALL OF YOU MY FAMILY ...
This Disease Gave me All of you and HOW LUCKY we all are to have such a
large support group and network and tools ...So I cant believe I am saying
this :)
but see we are BLESSED....most of the world does not know or live the life
as an addict with the 12 steps to help them and have so many friends
to be there for them...SO I AM GRATEFUL TO BE A RECOVERING ADDICT....
AND HOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU....??? I HOPE YOU CAN ONE DAY HAVE THE
DISEASE BE YOUR GIFT....and no longer live or feel CURSED....
GOD BLESS YOU ALL MY FAMILY....and my HP....
and remember there is never a reason to use again when even someone like me
as single mom and lost 2 children and cancer and 14 operations and lost my
business...and I am still clean b because I like this DISEASE.....
IT TRULY IS A GIFT....:)

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Easy Does It*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Receiving

Here is an exercise:
Today, let someone give to you.
Let someone do something nice for you.
Let someone give you a compliment or tell you something good about yourself.
Let someone help you.

Then, stand there and take it.
Take it in. Feel it.
Know that you are worthy and deserving.
Do not apologize.
Do not say, &quot; You shouldn't have.&quot;
Do not feel guilty, afraid,
ashamed, and panicky.
Do not immediately try to
give something back.
Just say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Today, I will let myself receive one thing from someone else,
and I will let myself be comfortable with that.

Nothing changes if nothing changes

I've got a pocketful of miracles,
and I got a ray of hope,
and I got these dreams that won't stop,
I'm gonna move me to the top.
All I need is a prayer
and the Lord to help me there.
Nothing changes if nothing changes!
You've got to start somewhere
Nothing changes if nothing changes!
You only have one life to live,
make it while you can.
I've got a world of desire
and I've got iron steel will
I got an open mind,
And I'm willing to make the changes
to get me there
Nothing changes if nothing changes!
You only have one life to live,
make it while you can.
Nothing  changes until we do,
Make the change
