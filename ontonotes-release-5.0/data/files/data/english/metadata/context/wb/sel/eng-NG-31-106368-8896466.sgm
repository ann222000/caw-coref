My son is almost 4 months now. I'd like to know if he is normal or a
&quot;high maintance baby&quot;. Usually if me or my wife are not holding him
he'll start crying. He usually stops when we pick him up, although not
always. Somedays he is very fussy and cries no matter what. It's very
uncommon to see him lie in his crib or pack and play quietly. At
night, fortunately he does seem to sleep through the night. Some
nights when we put him down to sleep he starts crying for a bit,
perhaps 10 minutes, then he falls asleep. Sometimes longer, sometimes
less, however, we don't pick him up. He wakes up around 4:30am and we
give him a feeding then he's good until 7am.  We

At the end of the day when I come home from work, my poor wife is
exhausted. I do what I can to help her out. He starts daycare shortly
for a few days a week. This will give my wife some R&amp;R thank God.

The pediatrician said it could be heartburn and gave us some
medication for that, however it doesn't seem to do anything. So we
believe it's not heartburn.

So is this normal for a baby? If not, what does this indicate of the
things to come later in a year or so? Will he always be a fussy baby?
I can't seem to get a answer from some friends. Some give me sarcastic
remarks such as &quot;yes when he's 18 you'll have some peace.&quot; I just want
to know what can my wife and I probably expect. Will he get less fussy
in a few months, or ??? It will be wonderful if the day ever comes
when we can just put him in his swing or crib without him start the
crying after 5 minutes.

Oh, btw my wife has probably tried everything to help stop him from
crying. Slings, babypack, jumpy seat, swings (3 different ones),
lights, noises, quiet, etc etc etc. They might work for 5 minutes, but
then the crying will start unless he's being held.

Unfortunately, it's really difficult to give any
sort of definitive answer.  It could be any number of things,
some of which are likely to resolve on their own at some point
in time, some of which you might be able to fix with some changes,
and some of which may just be personality features that stick around.
I understand that doesn't help you much!
Mostly all you can do is go through a process of
elimination.  Look at assorted theories of why he might be
so fussy, try to address them, and see if there's any improvement.
Obviously, you're already trying that with not much success so
far.  Each thing you cross off the list increases the odds that
it's something you can't do anything about, but there are so many
different things to try!
What is he eating?  What's his sleep schedule like during
the day?  What is he doing when he's not sleeping?  You say he's
happy as long as he's being held.  Is that true whether he's held
in arms or in a sling or carrier, or is he only happy held in your
arms?  Does it matter what position he's held in?
It certainly can be normal for a baby this age to be
unhappy if awake and not held.  Sometimes that's a phase and
sometimes it's indicative of a child who will be rather high
maintenance long term.  But is it possible that something else
is going on that you could &quot;fix&quot; if you only knew what it was?
You seem to have eliminated many things, but perhaps it's still
possible.  I'd keep in close communication with your daycare
folks.  If he behaves differently there, find out what they're
doing differently and see if you can implement it at home.
Do you have someone in your family who seems unusually good
with babies?  If so, and if that person is willing and has the
time, let that person have a go and see if there are any tips
that help.
I'm sorry you're going through this!  It's hard when
babies are fussy and no one knows why.

Best wishes,
Ericka

I don't really know what to suggest at the current time, but it might
reassure to know that my high needs baby is pretty easy now as a 4 year
old, but my easy baby is proving to be a challenging 2 year old who does
an awful lot of crying.

Hi guys and thanks for the responses. My poor wife is pretty wiped
out. She said he was fussy and crying most of the day. I came home and
he cried more. I don't know. We called the pediatrician and she said
we could bring him in either tonight or in the morning if we wanted
to. We drove over to the urgent care, and there was about 20 people
there waiting, the gal said it would be over an hour and wasn't even
sure if the doctor could see an infant. Needless to say, we didn't
want to wait an hour with a screaming baby so we decided to leave and
see if we could just put him to sleep.

We got home, swaddled him up and put him in his crib. He continued to
cry but for 20 minutes and then fell asleep. Tomorrow he starts
daycare so hopefully that goes okay. He's always been colicky, but we
went through the whole check list of things and can't figure out what
might be wrong. I doubt we'll ever know what exactly is wrong.
Hopefully he mellows out soon in the next couple months.

I'd recommend putting him in the buggy or sling and going out for a walk
when he's like that. #1 was like that during the day when she was tiny and
I'd put her in the pram and push round and round until she fell asleep
(sometimes this would take a long time). She almost always woke up within a
few minutes of stopping pushing so I'd continue walking until she'd had a
reasonable sleep and then she would be much happier.
When she got to about 9/10 months she suddenly started sleeping 2-3hours in
the afternoon in her cot and was much happier as she wasn't tired all
afternoon.

I suspect it will improve when either he starts sitting up (easier to play
with toys-#1 got much happier to be put down then) or crawling as they'e got
things to interest them.

Neither #1 or #2 liked to be put down as small babies. #1 I carried most of
the time we weren't out, and #2 I got used to doing everything with her in
the sling. #3 otoh has lain happily under the baby gym and drifts off to
sleep without problem since day 1. I can assure you I've done nothing
different, just some babies want to be held more than others.

I'd suggest your dw joins a few toddler/baby groups. There may well be other
mums that will hold the baby while she has a cup of tea, and you should get
some support from other people who know what you're going through.

What's his daytime routine like? I find if Jessie doesn't get her daytime
sleep (as well as her bed time sleep) dead on time, she goes nuts. I've had
to keep her off playgroup this week as she's getting 8 back teeth through
all at once, and is in agony so I've had to drop the plan to adjust her
daytime sleep, which gets in the way of playgroup (they both start at 1pm).
I've found that she really thrived once I had a daytime routine sorted as
she felt settled and knew exactly what was happening next - make sure you
work well with his daycare to provide consistency. It's not fair if he's
expected to do one thing some days and then something completely diferent
the rest of the week.

The other thing is to go out. When Jessica had(&amp;has) fussy days, it's hard
for me to find the time/motivation to go out. But to some extent now, I
ignore her a bit, and get her changing bag all packed up.Then that's it, I'm
gone for the day, the housework etc can wait, all the time I'm on the move,
she's good, and that does it for me! We stop for lunch and a nappy change
around 12ish, so that she's all fed and ready for 1, I get her to go to
sleep at 1, and then I relax until she wakes at 3. Normally I've taken a
book, so that I can read in the park or do some shopping in peace. Then when
she gets up, we walk for a couple more hours until my husband's nearly ready
to come home and we all have dinner together.

If he's crying because his teeth are on the move (they might not appear yet,
but can still give pain, try a little baby pain relief (I don't know what
you have in the US) and a teether.

But no, it's not usually an indication of the rest of his life - if
something's bothering him, he's going to cry about it, the same as in later
life - that doesn't mean he's always going to feel like crying! :)

Hugs to you and your wife - it's hard, I know. Jessica's going through the
holding her head and screaming phase because of all the teeth, so you've got
my sympathy.

My wife and I had this issue in the early months. It lasted a few
weeks. It seems like it was colic (spelling?) even though he was past
the age of when it is supposed to start.

Also, I would avoid day care. A 4 month old is too young for day care,
especially if one of you stay home.

It sounds to me like you have a colicy or high needs baby.  For a high needs
baby, this behavior is very normal.  It does tend to mellow out, but it may
be a while.  All you can do is support your wife as best you can.  A few
hours/days wtih the baby at daycare may be enough to help her feel human
again.  Also, make sure that you help out around the house -- dinner,
tidying up, and taking care of the baby while you push her out the door for
some alone time, are all really good for new moms.  Even more so on
weekends.

&gt; &gt; perhaps 10 minutes, then he falls asleep. Sometimes longer, sometimes
&gt; &gt; less, however, we don't pick him up. He wakes up around 4:30am and we
&gt; &gt; give him a feeding then he's good until 7am.  We

&gt; &gt; At the end of the day when I come home from work, my poor wife is
&gt; &gt; exhausted. I do what I can to help her out. He starts daycare shortly
&gt; &gt; for a few days a week. This will give my wife some R&amp;R thank God.

&gt; &gt; The pediatrician said it could be heartburn and gave us some
&gt; &gt; medication for that, however it doesn't seem to do anything. So we
&gt; &gt; believe it's not heartburn.

&gt; &gt; So is this normal for a baby? If not, what does this indicate of the
&gt; &gt; things to come later in a year or so? Will he always be a fussy baby?
&gt; &gt; I can't seem to get a answer from some friends. Some give me sarcastic
&gt; &gt; remarks such as &quot;yes when he's 18 you'll have some peace.&quot; I just want
&gt; &gt; to know what can my wife and I probably expect. Will he get less fussy
&gt; &gt; in a few months, or ??? It will be wonderful if the day ever comes
&gt; &gt; when we can just put him in his swing or crib without him start the
&gt; &gt; crying after 5 minutes.

&gt; &gt; Oh, btw my wife has probably tried everything to help stop him from
&gt; &gt; crying. Slings, babypack, jumpy seat, swings (3 different ones),
&gt; &gt; lights, noises, quiet, etc etc etc. They might work for 5 minutes, but
&gt; &gt; then the crying will start unless he's being held.- Hide quoted text -

Sounds like colic. Mylican is what i used when my daughter was
colicky. It felt like she screamed for days and non-stop. and when you
put him to sleep wrap him tightly(you know how tight is proper) and
lay him down wrapped just as tight and he should sleep better.
Peppermint water also helps soothe an upset tummmy. Lay him across
your lap on his belly. Just ideas that helped me..

I used Mylican drops or Peppermint water for an upset tummy.. It
sounds like colic. keep him out of the wind. wrap him snugly in
blankets and when he goes to sleep keep him wrapped tightly in the
blankets. My daughter screamed and fussed for days or at least it felt
like it anyways.. Try laying hin across your knees on his belly and
see if the pressure on his belly soothes him at all..
