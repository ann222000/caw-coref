I like that you can define menus for a form, but is there any way to
get the top menus to behave like they do in the forms designer, i.e.
as a PROCESS.EVENTSOURCE for the current active form?

The reason I ask is because I'd like to use the left panel for
navigation and the top menu like a typical expanding/collapsing
command bar like you see in Windows Apps:

File | Tools | Help
-------
New
Save
Save As

or

File | Tools | Help
-------
About

I just can't get my head around how to make this happen with the
current design.

Any ideas? Am I missing something obvious?

Regards,
Jeff

Well, I'm closer. I figured out how to hack a properly layered
embedded frame into the form so that it expands over the form's
contents (see screenshot embedded_menu.jpg in the forum's files) . If
I stick with this I can just hide the top frame.

Next step: replace the embedded menu with my own CSS-based frame and
have it get its items (probably in JSON) from a hidden field on the
parent form.

Interesting question!

Unless DBI says otherwise I think they're cheating when they do this.  :)
I took a look at the XML in the DBIXMLLOG and then I used a binary editor
to peek into the BAWEBEXEC object code.  (David M is probably cringing at
this - LOL)

It seems DBI has created some of their menus by hardcoding XML into their
code and passing it into the stream of components that need to get rendered
by the HTML generation engine.  When we click a menu item it fires a custom
event back to BAWEBEXEC, which is neither a request for a form nor a menu.
They take the ID of the menu item clicked, and look down a CASE structure
to see which function needs to be invoked.  The event which is fired for a
menu click is not exposed to us poor folk who write apps with DesignBais.
:)

I tried to modify standard menus in various ways to execute a subroutine
rather than load a form, but I was unsucessful.  In all cases DB seems to
generate an IERR.TEXT with a message that the specified form can't be
loaded.  If we do insert some bogus form name I don't know of a way to get
the form load process to cancel.

The idea here is that we request a form that has no components, a Before
Screen or Get Screen event loads a DBStore value with something we can use
and then the request for the new form is &quot;somehow&quot; cancelled, thus
preventing the screen refresh, and making it look like the menu click is
intended for the current form.  I don't think this can be done in v4.1.4.
First, to cancel the event, I think we can use IERR.TEXT, but that might
cause a dialog to display for the user, which is not good.  Second, I think
the form will refresh no matter what, maybe to a blank form if IERR.TEXT is
set.

Side note: I made a request a while back to allow us to cancel an event or
flag the failure of a Validation using IERR.TEXT - without that variable
being used for the dual purpose of popping up a dialog for the user.  To
advise a user that something is wrong I might prefer to bold the text input
box, display a red label next to the input box, or use some other mechanism
that doesn't require the user to grab the mouse if they typed in something
invalid.  I don't know if we'll get that in v4.2 but I don't think so.

As a solution to the problem Jeff describes, I suspect it wouldn't take
much to get DBI to document a standard menu-click event such as the one
that they use, and rather than handling _all_ of these events themselves
they can set PROCESS.EVENT and PROCESS.EVENTSOURCE and pass the event out
to us like all of the others.  Now that v4.2 is approaching final
development though, again I don't think we'll get this for a while if at
all.

Hi Tony,

Thanks for this very thorough answer. I'm glad to see somebody else
out there digging. I was looking at the BAWEBEXEC binary myself
yesterday and I came to the same conclusion. But it's just a browser
app, so I will make this happen come hell or high water. In spite of
the Deep Blue victories I have a rule: Never Let the Computer Win.

So I keep falling back on the notion of indirection, especially since
that seems to be our lot in life. I was hoping I might be able to do
something without resorting to client-side scripting but it looks like
I'm probably stuck with that too. These devious script injection
techniques have made me realize just how dangerous it is to surf the
internet these days.  ;)

Being a geek I obviously get excited about breaking the barriers of the
tools we have.  However, my &quot;geek bit&quot; temporarily got toggled off with
references to JSON, script injection, and the determination expressed
above.

I encourage you keep in mind the intended audience for both DesignBais
developers and end-users.
- DesignBais was created to allow developers to do great things with very
little fuss - the kind of stuff you and I live on.
- DesignBais was created to allow these developers to get to market quickly
with a new front-end for their application.
- The target audience requires a business-professional interface that's
attractive and certainly more than a glorified green screen, but it must be
fast, easy to use, and not too complicated.
- The ultimate goal here is to allow these business software companies to
quickly make lots of money by selling software and services to new and
existing clients.

If we spend too much time hacking into this tool, or too much time making
screens that have lots of popups and pulldowns and click-this and
hide-that, we will almost certainly miss some of these objectives.  The
code may become unmaintainable for &quot;the next&quot; developer, and the product
may not get to market as fast as it should.

As you continue to look into getting the most from this great product,
please ensure that your efforts are guided by the primary goals.  Will your
enhancements help your company to accomplish our common goals of:

- selling quality software
- quickly
- to more new sites
- with a minimal amount of development effort

If your company continues to sell the software, and you can add features
which truly add value, and you can do this relatively quickly, and you are
not creating a maintenance problem for later ... then go for it dude.  If
there is any doubt about whether your efforts conflict with one or more of
the stated goals, please check with your manager and make sure your goals
coincide with company goals.  :)

HTH

Yes, a geek, but also a business owner.

Tony,

Where to start? The &quot;dude&quot; reference? No, that's ok... dude (what are
we now, twelve?). The assumption that I need to be reminded to focus
on quality, timeliness, reach, maintainability, etc.? Maybe later. The
assumption that my determination might be in spite of business goals?
I think that comes now.

Did you notice the hours I typically post on this site? I work in the
eastern time zone of North America. I tend to &quot;hack&quot; DesignBais on
evenings and weekends. My extra-curricular research on DesignBais is
certainly not for direct remuneration but neither is it for indirect
financial gain. Can you say the same?

So why do I bother at all? I believe that people buy software they
love to use and then they tell people about it. I want to help produce
that kind of software. I want do do that because I think that will
make my employers some money and of course by extention, I might
eventually make some too.

Another reason I do after hours work is because when life throws me
lemons I try like hell to make lemonade. And I post about it here
because I figure others might appreciate the desire rise above their
frustrations and ask, &quot;I know it's not designed to do this, but is it
possible?&quot;

You have seen my post on the tab dialog, so you know I'm willing to
share my ideas. That solution took far too long to achieve, and I had
to go down a lot of blind alleys to achieve it. This time I thought I
might make public notes along the way in case people might shorten he
research or else benefit from the thinking process. Isn't this what
discussion forums are for?

I appreciate the spirit of the lecture, Tony, but ask anybody who has
worked with or for me and you'll find that on most points you're
preaching to the choir.

Regards,
Jeff

P.S. has anybody got an answer to Jay's question about testing? If
we're encouraging people to get to market quickly, we probably want to
foster a fully testable and refactorable product.

Sigh, Jeff, I'm sorry.  Of course something that one person writes will
prompt my response but I try to frame my responses to be more inclusive of
the sheer number of people who subscribe to these forums.  My notes are
frequently not intended toward one person but for a general audience.  The
less focused the message the more someone will think all points relate to
them.  In this medium it's difficult for people to read these subtleties,
and being human I occasionally don't do a good job of making all of my
intents clear.  Again, sorry.

My comments were for anyone who goes down this path, to clarify how this
extra curricular activity fits into the big picure.  I know DesignBais
developers who sometimes lose sight of the forest because they're focusing
on trees - even without hacking the default environment.  If you &quot;get it&quot;
(and you obviously do, Jeff), great, please let it roll off.  If these
notes cause others to re-think their development approach, then I've
annoyed some but helped others.  I shoot for the numbers - if I lose once
in a while and other people win, I'm still happy.

Of course I appreciate your after-hour efforts, as I hope some people
appreciate and have benefit from mine.  I'm tickled to know that someone
else out there is having fun poking into this product like I do.
(Seriously, how many people take a binary editor to object code?)  And I
hope more people join us as this product grows in popularity.
(I can just hear David McLean groaning... ;)  )

No, no one pays me for my blog, my forum comments, or for poking into this
or any other product.  (Though I'm sure some people would pay me to stop
doing all of these things.)  My &quot;pay off&quot; comes when I'm teaching a DB
class, someone asks me how to do something, and I know exactly what they
can and should do (and I've been reminded recently that I should take more
time to advise people on what they should Not do).  My pay off comes when I
can write code to generate a massive DB environment in a minute and save my
client a month of development time.  And when someone wants to add special
value to their nice new DB front-end, my pay off is when they remember that
I and others associated with my company have the knowledge to do it.  I
tend to invest in the future, but until then I'm pretty much in the same
boat as you.

And once in a while I try to break up these dry discussions with just a
little bit of levity, and I can only hope most people will appreciate my
brand of humour... dude... ;)

Looking forward to more technical discussions, eh?
My best,
T
