SSDI & LTD - Help!

Just when I thought my life was going well and that I'd be able to
survive, I got hit with a whammy. My HR manager at my former employer
told me that I could get LTD and SSDI - no problem. Now I get a letter
in the mail from the LTD company that says if I get SSDI that my LTD
benefits will be reduced by the amount of the SSDI. Since my SSDI
benefits are more than my LTD, that means I get nothing from LTD. Not
only that, the letter also states that if I get SSDI I have to pay
them back for the LTD they've paid out to me already. In my case,
that's $1600.  Now, no way do I have that money as I paid bills with
it and got everything caught up. I figured the LTD would cover my
COBRA. And now I am really screwed as there is no way I can afford
COBRA on what SSDI is giving me.

If anyone has any advice, I'm listening because I have no idea what
I'm going to do. Are there any social programs that might support me
financially? I guess even loans will help... Why can't life leave me
alone for a while?

There are 50 states in the U.S. and everyone of them have different
rules and laws.

There are different social programs in all 50 states.

We don't know the terms/wording  of the LT policy and your company's
pact/contract with it.

In other words, there are just too many unknows to answer your
question....and we are not lawyers.

However, many, many churches have social programs and if you
are a member of one, you may want to inquire there.

A Legal Aid group is another place to look.

Actually you have to pay back the LTD for the months you got SSDI. So
if you got LTD for let's say August-December and started on SSDI in
November,
you'd have to pay the LTD back for November and December, but not for the
months before you started on SSDI.

Call or visit your local social services dept and see what help they can
offer.

When you and if you get your SSDI...you should will probably get back
pay...because it takes so long to get SSDI...and when you do...The back pay
will go to your LTD insurance carrier instead of you...
At that time, if you are no longer eligible for LTD you will not get it. I
don't really know about your insurance payments. Since I was eligible for
LTD I was still covered for my insurance at work. I had to pay my premimums
just like I was working. I didn't have to pay cobra premimums which are
usually higher.
Not until I was deemed not disabled by my LTD insurance standards did I
loose them. But by that time I was covered by Medicare. My LTD went to all
the trouble to help me get my SSDI, but then said after I was on LTD for 2
years and the US gov said I was Disabled...I no longer was disabled under
there guidelines...go figure...
You may qualify for insurance programs through your state.
Good luck and hang in there..
Cindy
