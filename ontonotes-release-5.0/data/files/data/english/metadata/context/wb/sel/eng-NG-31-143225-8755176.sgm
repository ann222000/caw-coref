Obama vs. Osama by Na'im AbdurRafi That’s the match-up we want. For America. For the world. For the kids who signed for education and must give arms and legs. And for the unborn. For the sake of discussion let’s assume there is an Osama. And that he is the legitimate face of the jihad. Certainly there is a jihad. How could there not be with Beck, Hannity, and Savage inspiring a crusade? Why else did Sergeant Akbar roll those grenades? (Assuming he did.) I saw the planes on television—and I visited Ground Zero. I believe the wildfires are raging. And the bridges are collapsing. A good friend worked in the Katrina aftermath. So I believe it happened. I was flooded out of my home in upstate New York. It’s been happening. And Obama can stop it. He can win for America and the world. And Osama will win too. When you go to the table everybody’s got to win. That’s what should have happened after 9/11. “Okay, you made your point. We get it. What can we do to settle this thing?” I think Obama understood all along. He has always been against the war. He knew the deal. Certainly he understands now. He has said he would talk. (Actually the talks should start now. Obama would and should get the credit--and the presidency.) And Obama has said he would invade Pakistan. Translation: “Hey, Osama, come to the table.” “No problem,” responds Osama. “I know the Qur’an. Just been waiting for the invitation.” And what do the Muslims want? That’s easy:
Stop killing us as you have been doing for decades—just because we are Muslims;
Stop the proxy wars implemented by renegades from Islam posing as leaders in the “Muslim World”;
Stop pandering to the youth as a means of promoting Western “freedom” where Islam is firmly rooted. That’s sedition. Duh. And tell Israel to relax, for God’s sake. “Look out Moishe. Muslim power go’ get yo’ mama.” (Thank you, Julius Lester.) Relax, Moishe. Read the Qur’an. Yo’ mama is safe with Osama. (And yo’ mama is safe with Obama.)

August 2007. [The writer is a prominent Muslim writer and poet from upstate New York.] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Extraordinary Letter to New Trend from Pakistan Abdul Rashid Ghazi [shaheed] was like a brother to him: Islamic revolution in Pakistan is coming, reader says
Dear Brother, Asalam O Alekum Your mails are very welcomed and I am thankful for this favor. My life's best and memorable part is that which I have spent being in contact with Brother Ghazi, who in my opinion has performed the greatest Jihad as Imam Hussain. Now Pakistan is turning. Inqilaab is not too far away. Maulana Abdul Aziz is also like brother to me as I also call him Bhai, ( my father is his legal advisor and counsel ). Maulana is in high sprit and his morale is also high. He is now hope of millions of Muslims. I believe that sacrifice of shuhada of Lal Masjid will achieve its goal and we all will witness Inqilaab .

OUR AMERICA: Three items from New Trend's Media Monitor
August 8: We mourn the execution style murder of three students and serious injury to one in Newark, New Jersey. Violence in America has taken on pandemic proportions. The overall egocentric culture teaches love of wealth and things, develops desire for physical and financial power and minimizes respect for elders, values and religion.  Christianity has become a mere &quot;feel good&quot; cult which gives no sense of direction or purpose to young people.
The cult of drugs, weapons and sex is rampant. It is being deliberately and systematically directed at young people. We urge readers in the Black community to write to BET and TV 9 to protest the degradation of humanity these TV channels are disseminating. One recent movie more or less provided the scenario for the Newark murders As the arrest of a 15 year old and a 31 year old [August 9] in the crime shows, violent power action affects a whole range of people all the way from early teens to near middle age. The race factor is never too far from the hatred and insensitivity displayed in these crimes.
------------------------------------------------------------------- If Only Pakistanis were to Listen to Bush ! August 9, 2007: During his press conference President Bush pointed out that the imposition [by General Musharraf] of Emergency Rule in Pakistan is not being contemplated. He was emphatic that there is &quot;good intelligence sharing&quot; between Pakistan and the U.S. He added that he and Musharraf have the same concern about &quot;extremists and radicals.&quot; About intelligence sharing, Bush said &quot;we talk to Pakistan continually&quot; so there is no question of unilateral action by the U.S. He was responding to the concern about his earlier statement that &quot;we&quot; would take action against Pakistan if &quot;actionable intelligence&quot; were available about the presence of Osama bin Laden and others, somewhat like the position taken by Barack Obama. Bush explained that &quot;we&quot; means the U.S. and Pakistan governments working together. He added that he wants &quot;free elections&quot; in Pakistan. { Ed. note: Musharraf's regime plays a trick on Pakistanis which always works: He pretends that Pakistan is acting against &quot;terrorists&quot; because it is in Pakistan's interest to do so. The U.S. cannot do anything in Pakistan, he claims. Naive Pakistanis, bravely nationalistic, are taken in by this disinformation. The fact is that Musharraf cannot do anything unless it is approved by Washington. Democracy is  meaningless in Pakistan. It will be &quot;American democracy&quot; or &quot;military democracy.&quot;} [Now don't laugh at this: Bush concluded by saying: &quot;We don't torture.&quot; He really wants Guantanamo to be closed down, he said.] The Pakistani opposition should concede that Musharraf has some &quot;slick operators&quot; who can fool just about any politician. Top of the line are Choudhury Shujaat Hussain and Mushahid Hussain , &quot;leaders&quot; of the political party fabricated by Musharraf known as Muslim League [Q}, under the pretense that it represents Qaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah! Shujaat was also used to misdirect the people of Jamia Hafsa. Owais Ahmed Ghani , Governor of Baluchistan, who was in the U.S. in the last two weeks, is excellent. He even has a beard, dresses like a Pakistani and speaks excellent English. He proudly told American audiences that Pakistani intelligence was responsible for the murder of Islamic leader Abdullah Mehsud recently [New Trend reported his funeral in South Waziristan]. Ghani is proud that although Karzai was not able to kill Mehsud in spite of heavy NATO presence in Helmand province, he was caught and killed by Pakistani special forces as soon as he entered Baluchistan [Zhob area]. -------------------------------------------------------
Afghanistan According to Bush and Karzai: Joint Press Statements

August 6: At the end of his visit with President Bush, Karzai, the ruler of Kabul, declared that there is no danger to his government from the Taliban. He claimed that the Taliban are &quot;a force that's defeated, it's a force that is frustrated.&quot; He claimed that the Taliban are &quot;killing children.&quot; [He says this every time he visits the U.S. When he goes back, he puts out feelers asking the Taliban to negotiate with him.] Karzai tells fabricated stories about martyrdom operators. He thinks they are &quot;brainwashed.&quot; We are fighting &quot;evil,&quot; he proclaims. &quot;They are buying and selling suicide bombers&quot; he claimed. Karzai's stories are becoming less and less believable.  Observers in
Afghanistan admit, most of southern, southwestern and eastern Afghanistan are now in Taliban hands. The NATO forces do not move without heavy weapons and air cover.

President Bush was even more interesting. He came up with the weird claim that the  U.S. is killing Afghan civilians because Taliban use them as &quot;human shields.&quot; The President seems to have the idea that Taliban are not Afghans, have no families, and come from &quot;outside&quot; to torment the Afghan people. Karzai thinks that NATO and U.S. troops are not occupiers. After all his regime depends on them.

Karzai and Bush claimed that they would break the back of the Taliban. Haven't the Taliban heard that before from the British and the Canadians and the Australians? How long will these &quot;leaders&quot; keep fooling the American people.
New Trend observers say that Karzai cleverly puts the blame on the
Taliban for poppy cultivation and export to the west. All the highways and transportation systems in Afghanistan are controlled by NATO and the U.S. air force. There is no way that the drug trade could come out of Afghanistan without the consent of NATO, Pakistan and Iran.

Islam in America.
The Lack of Accountability among Muslim Fundraisers . We have received the following rare, courageous letter in the context of the fund raiser held at ADAMS Center, Virginia,  on July 29 supported by Mahdi Bray and &quot;Imam&quot; Magid to collect funds for Asma Hanif's women's project. The show had Native Deen singers as its highlight,  a group supported by the State Department and various U.S. embassies. Mauri Saalakhan , who is notorious for always being there when money is being collected, like the fly buzzing around dirt, went to the extent of justifying, in writing, Native Deen's State Department-sponsored trip. What is happening to our Muslim communities when opportunists like Mauri Saalakhan , Mahdi Bray, &quot;Imam&quot; Magid, Native Deen etc can  project themselves as leaders to squeeze money out of the Ummah? [Investigator's comment.]

Re: Fund Raising Activity / Conflict of Interest: ADAMS Center on July 29, 2007

I applaud New Trend magazine for the consistent efforts made to investigate fundraising activity in the Muslim community.  I was appalled to learn about the conflict of interest between organizers of the
recent
fundraiser for homeless Muslim women and staff of Asma Hanif.  We need to hold groups accountable that do public fundraising in our communities for activities that fade away from the public view as soon as the money is
collected.
Case in point, in the days leading up to the recent fundraiser held at ADAMS Center for homeless Muslim women, emails were sent several times a day requesting the community to buy tickets for this event.
However, not a single email has been sent to the community since to give an account of how much was actually raised and how that money will be distributed! More troubling is the fact that the organizers of the event made phone calls requesting donations to pay for a shelter but no accountability of funds collected has been made public to the community.  Looks like the
carpetbaggers have descended on our community to play on our sympathies!

The sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) enjoins each Muslim to avoid suspicious actions that create fitnah in the community.  Groups that expect the public to donate large sums of money should also expect to be
report back to the community and be held accountable for the money they collect.  Keep up the good work, New Trend, and keep the pressure on these groups to be open, public, and accountable!
