August did not start particularly well. Our first Tuesday
session in Karazhan too too many tries to kill Moroes. This time,
my being slow to react to shackle breaks wasn't a factor: I was
on Dorandy that run, learning to hit #2 on the damage charts.
After taking three tries to down Maiden, it was time for bed.

As usual, my luck turned in the middle of the week. There was
a bit of confusion on Thursday which group I should go with:
the one I was with on Dorandy on Tuesday would start clearing
to Aran, the other group had made better time and already
cleared Aran and chess and would start clearing toward Prince.
I am eventually given to the Prince group, and head up the tower.

We get to the fight pretty quickly. After five tries or so,
Prince goes down. No hammers drop. I do, however, win the Tier 4
headpiece. We happily head down the tower to the Master's Terrace
for a crack at Nightbane. I still had Medivh's Journal from
killing Aran, so I read it while there; then we explained the fight
and got to it. Our learning curve is the same, Nightbane goes
down in five tries, only the second kill for Omani.

With lots of time left, we head back up the tower for a try
at the only Kara boss Omani has not yet killed, and may not
have seriously attempted, Netherspite. A recruit from a recently
busted guild that was much farther along in BC progression
explains the fight, which many of us have studied elsewhere.
There are two types of phases: beam phases and rage phases.
During beam phases, raiders must intercept energy beams to
deprive Netherspite of power and gain power of their own,
at a cost. During rage phases the MT and a couple of healers
keep him busy while the rest of the raid moves off and bandages.

A beam intercept rotation is set up: our druid MT takes the
red beam during the first beam phase, getting instant aggro
and 46k health. The green beam is taken by a pally in tanking
gear. The switch beams during the second beam phase, trading
thourghout the fight until the dragon is dead. The blue beam is
held for the first half of the first beam phase by the moonkin
doing all the explaining. For the rest of that phase a mage
takes it, getting heavy heals. For the even numbered beam
phases a warlock takes it all the way through, keeping himself
up with Drain Life.

It's a chaotic, fun fight. At one point I take the red beam,
getting 36k health, which dosen't last long. When I take the
green beam my mana pool goes down but my Renews tick for up
to 1600. Eventually, however, we get everything down, and
we get a guild first: Netherspite goes down! Kara is clear!
Much rejoicing.

One of the items that drops is a healing neck item no one
wants, so it gets pushed onto me. I am reluctant, having gotten
something already, and having now four neck items, one with
more +heal, another with more mana regen. This one, however, has
stamina, which I take for survivability. Yet more gear clutter
for me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether Kara was cleared or not, Gruul's Lair was on schedule
for Friday. This would test where we were and what we needed to
work on.

The instance is dead simple. One patroller - instantly somebody
dies; these guys hit like trucks. Two guards. Then already we
are at High King Maulgar. The fight is explained, and roles are
assigned.

I have my hands full spamming big heals on the MT. A mage
&quot;tanks&quot; Krosh, stealing his spell shield. A warlock takes
Olm, enslaving his pet and tanking him with it. Blindeye is the
first burn-down target, then Kiggler, then Krosh and Olm
together, then Maulgar.

We spend three hours wrestling with the ogre before calling it
a night. Our best performance gets the first two targets down.
Complete wipes are rare with the exit at our back, but most of
our resets are forced when the mage taking Krosh goes down.
We will need to try all of our mages in the role, and stock up
on cloth stamina gear to make healing them easier. His Greater
Fireballs ignore resistance gear; you have to Dampen Magic and
shield the mage. Often a fireball gets off before the spell
shield is up. Likewise with Olm, he often Deathcoils before
summoning the felhunter.

We now know where we stand: we can farm Kara and heroics for
a while yet, but need to look for stamina gear, and work on our
reactions. No further attempts on schedule for two weeks at least,
but we will get back there eventually.

We can now farm most of Kara; last Tuesday both of our groups
took down Prince. I was only on for half the run in my group, but
Card got not one but two weapons - the Maiden hammer I wanted so
much, enchanted on the spot with +81 healing, and the Staff of
Infinite Mysteries from Curator, which our mages had and the raid
leaders did not want to d/e. I rather wish I had been on Dorandy
for that fight - she would have really used it. But Dorandy was
used in the Wizard of Oz fight, and they practically forced me
to take the Ruby Slippers. Now if only I could get the Wicked
Witch's Hat...

(At this rate, I will have everything Kara has to offer in about
three weeks. Really, some of the other people in the guild need
to win stuff; they will make us stronger for Gruul.)

last time we did gruul, i had to tank (mage who normaly does it wasn't
there)

like, NO PRESSURE !
lol

use invisibility to go up to the ledge on the right
stand on the corner and shoot the mage, we have the mage pulling to start,
hunters doing misdirect to grab the other mobs etc
do detect magic, fire shield, shoot the crap out of him to start the fight,
he runs up to right in front of me, steal shield off him
drop down, the mage stays up on the ledge, which is great, since his AOE
does 4-5k damage, which isn't much help ...

anyway, the buff lasts 30 seconds, it runs out, and you have to grab the
next one right away, if you take 2 fireballs(9k damage), you die, and it's a
wipe (near end of buff, stop dps and just spam spellsteal button)

gear wise just get the mages to go AH and buy some stamina greens
they need to have about 12k stam when buffed(10k unbuffed), more is better
of course ( you gotta be able to take a 9k fireball, and have 2k health or
so to soak up the next fireball, which will be nerfed due to you having
shield)

don't forget to have enough mana, it's not *too* important though, you only
need enough to spellsteal and dps long enough for the raid to come over and
kill the mage
some +dmg is nice (makes more threat)

you also need as much +hit you can pack in
if you get a resist when using spellsteal, you are prob screwed

don't go overboard and buy a complete 'of stamina' set, neither get every
+hit item you can find, you just need to balance it really
i ended up using about errrmm, maybe half my items as stamina greens, get
stam enchants and stuff too
i had about 12k health, 8.5k mana, 5% hit, 600+damage

anyone, was fun tanking, i screwed up the first time though, the stupid
shammy endedup near me, so i moved to get out the way of the AOE, and the
buff ran out doh, second time boss down, no problem :)

every charge they reset aggro, i think having one tank standing in the
raid instantly taunting the mob will protect your soft targets most of the
time.

as said in other responses, the mage needs stamina and hit (balanced)

we assign two tanks (warrior or feral) to the warlock and have two warlocks
banish the pets.
also we assign 2 healers for their aid.

mage is healed by one healer
and the two hunters tanking the shaman are healed by another healer.
the rest concentrates on the mt.

shaman and mt healer may drop a hot or so to the one tanking the healer.

after that the warlock dies, then we split dps
ranged take down the mage and rogues offwarriors and feral druids take down
the shaman.

once that is done you only have maulgar to deal with.

during the fight assign any free tank to assist in keeping the warlock pets
away from the healers until banished.

i think your very near to a kill since the fight is hard in the beginning
and gets easier the more adds you take down.
similar to fathom lord karathress (only difference is karathress inherits
abilities from his adds, maulgar doesnt)

gruul is simply coordination and dps ;)

have fun !

We got Gruul for 1st time on Sunday.  We went into High King with many
tanks but then after wiping on Gruul a couple times the guild made the
decision to dump extra tanks for ranged dps on Gruul.  A tough call
but it made the difference.  I got to stay as Feral OT.  It was still
a mother.  Both tanks dead and I think 3 left alive when Gruul dies.

A lot of dps, yes.  But just as imporatnt is everyone learning the
shatter dance and how to get the hell away from each other.  And how
to focus heals on the MT at grow 10 and on.

Well the week prior when we tried him 6 times or so we started only
getting him to 80%, but each try quickly improved--65%, 40% , 30% 16%,
18%, 16% and we just stayed there.  Came in next week and tried 3
times i think like that and that is when we dropped extra tanks and
finally beat him on 2nd try.  But still close.

And YOU may be fine on getting away from others but that Gruul noob
moving right toward you might not, hehe.

And yeah, gotta get out of the cave ins.

well with raid composition i think its best not to take more than 2
defensive tanks
and let hybrids (offtanks or ferals) to some tanking for the first boss.
once you reach gruul himself they can revert to a dps role.

most of the time its been the best thing to have a defensive warrior take
the maintank part and
a feraldruid as 2nd tank to catch the hurtful strikes. thats because a feral
can build up more aggression with less rage, than a warrior and melee-dps is
a bit safer here then.

We do it with a warrior MT and myself as feral druid OT.

And as for what you take to High King being right to do Gruul, a lot
depends on size of guild to have ferals that can dps and also warriors
that can dps.  Otherwise, you make the switch.  Or eventually you are
all geared enough where it doesn't matter.
