The report is that a record number of Jews are moving to Israel right now.
That is so right.  It may be the last moment of 'this world'.  I personally
hope to make Aliyah, with all that I am I hope this.  To flee America and to
go to one of the few free places left in the entire world, Israel.  And may
we bless Israel, and cause her to stand up, alone with Hashem as the United
States of America, the EU, the UN, the entire arab world, all come against
'free' Israel with the cursed intent to wipe Israel out of existence.

1. Freedom for Jewish Prisoners Demanded

by Hillel Fendel

The Honenu civil rights organization
&lt; http://trailer.web-view.net/Links/0X3AC2192F7461D66B8B014BD8C8F986A50...
BD641AB0E43B86D05A937B1BE45D85E3269D57C1BF1888DF2BF1408292059D4608E46745B81 8
6735DBD637488.htm&gt;  demands freedom for Jewish security prisoners, in the
wake of the release of Palestinian terrorists from Israeli prisons.

&quot;We are against the release of any Arab terrorists from Israeli prison,&quot;
emphasizes Shmuel (Zangy) Medad, the indefatigable founder of Honenu.  &quot;This
includes the four Jordanian murderers who were freed this week, and the 250
whom Prime Minister Olmert is planning to release as a 'gesture' to Abu
Mazen, and the hundreds or more that Israel may soon give in exchange for
Gilad Shalit.  The release of terrorists is a sign of weakness, adds
experienced terrorists to the war effort against us, and is a dangerous
precedent that encourages more terrorism and kidnappings.&quot;

&quot;However, the fact is that Israel has already freed terrorists,&quot; Medad says,
&quot;and therefore, in all fairness and justice, Jews and Israelis in prison for
security crimes must also be released.&quot;

Asked what recent terrorist releases he is referring to, Zangy - who lives
with his wife Ettie and their ten children in Hevron - said, &quot;There have
been several, in addition to the  release of the Jordanians today. Just a
couple of weeks ago, when Hamas overrode Gaza and a host of Fatah terrorists
ran for their lives, Israel deliberated for a couple of days, and finally
allowed them to be taken safely to Ramallah - instead of arresting them on
the spot, like a normal country would have done.&quot;

&quot;In addition,&quot; Medad continued, &quot;there was the release of hundreds for
Elchanan Tenenbaum and three dead bodies.  Shortly before that, a few
hundred more were released.&quot;  In August 2003, Israel released 339
Palestinian Authority prisoners as a goodwill gesture to the PA.  Of these,
182 were in prison for terrorist activity, and 157 were administrative
detainees.

Double Standard
Medad decried the approach of some Israelis who apply a double standard - to
the detriment of Israel.  As an example, Arutz-7 notes former Education
Minister Shulamit Aloni.  In October 1995, Aloni voiced her opposition to
the release of Ami Popper (see below).  At the same time, Minister Aloni
said that Arab terrorists could be released because they were fighting for
the &quot;freedom of their nation&quot; and acting in the service of a recognized
organization.  Dr. Aryeh Bachrach, the father of Ehud who had been murdered
two months earlier by Arabs in Wadi Kelt, asked then-Attorney General
Ben-Yair to remove Minister Aloni's parliamentary immunity and prosecute her
for legitimizing the murder of Jews by terrorists.

Honenu has prepared a list of 37 men who are in prison or who are charged
with security-related crimes.  Virtually all of the alleged crimes were
perpetrated, if at all, in response to Palestinian or other Arab terrorism.
Jewish prisoners whose release, or an end to their legal proceedings, Honenu
demands:

Shimshon Cytryn

6735DBD637488.htm&gt; , 20, convicted of aggravated assault (though innocent of
attempted murder) in a rock-throwing incident in Gush Katif two years ago.
He is to be married in one month, and to be sentenced in two months.

Border Guard Policeman Shmuel Yechezkel, 22. In a clash with Arabs in
eastern Jerusalem, one of whom was placed under arrest, he shot a terrorist
who tried to run him over and free his arrested friend.  Yechezkel was
acquitted in trial, but the State is appealing.

the Bedouin, one of whom later died.

Haggai Amir - in addition to his conviction on charges related to the
assassination of Yitzchak Rabin, for which he has completed his sentence, he
is also serving another four years for planning partisan attacks against
Arabs in defense of Yesha towns.

Danny Halamish, Itzik Halamish, and Baruch Feldbaum - accused of firing in
the air to scare off a group of Arabs who encroached on their grazing land
in Gush Etzion.  They were sentenced to 17, 8 and 9 months in prison,
respectively.

Nissim Kurkus of Jerusalem. He was attacked by a group of Bethelehem Arabs,
who wounded him in his head with knives and other means.  He fought back and
stabbed to death one of his attackers - and was ordered placed in an Israeli
Prison Service psychiatric hospital for nine years.

David Emouyal of Rishon LeTzion - shot and wounded two Arabs in response to
the murder of the 8-month-old Shalhevet Pass in Hevron. He was sentenced to
18 years in prison.

Ami Popper, who killed 7 Arab workers in response to a series of Palestinian
terrorist attacks.  Sentenced to life, but his sentence was later reduced to
40 years by the late President Ezer Weizman.  His wife and son were recently
killed in a car accident (Popper was driving), and his two remaining sons,
with no parents to look after them, have been given over to the foster care
of a generous Jerusalem family.

Gur Hamel, 35, of Itamar.  On the one-month anniversary of the terrorist
murder of his two friends Harel Bin-Nun and Shlomo Libman, and the day that
Danny Vargas of Hevron was similarly murdered, he shot and killed an Arab in
a neighboring village.  He was sentenced to life in prison.

Four Jerusalem Jews, who were sentenced to 2, 3, 3, and 6 years respectively
for membership in an organization to attacks Arabs in Jerusalem.

Others on the list include Elyashiv Gelbard, Moshe Scali, Aryeh Tessler,
Shachar Zeliger-Dvir, Danny Tikman, Felix Milner, Shlomo Dvir, Yarden Morag,

2. Regaining the Land of Israel Spirit: Five New Sites Planned

by Hillel Fendel

&quot;We have forgotten our destiny,&quot; people are complaining - and five new
Jewish settlement sites are being planned in Judea and Samaria.

Families are being collected and are preparing to become the pioneers who
will start five new Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria in the coming weeks
and months.  First and foremost will be Givat HaEitam, in the northern end
of Gush Etzion's Efrat, overlooking Solomon's Pools just south of Bethlehem.
The goal is not to start another hilltop outpost, but rather a full-fledged
neighborhood in an outlying area of an already-existing town.

Yehudit Katzover of the Land of Israel Faithful explains: &quot;We have forgotten
the basics.  Everything now has become checkpoints and fences and retreats.
We must be connected with the Land of Israel, and not let our enemies take
it over!&quot;

Givat HaEitam is an urgent front-line location in that struggle, Katzover
explains: &quot;The cursed wall tearing apart our Land right down its middle is
planned to be built inside an area that belongs to Efrat.  They have already
begun work, and soon Eitam - which was planned for 2,500 housing units for
Efrat! - will be in Palestinian hands, if we don't stop it.&quot;

Five families have already signed up for Givat HaEitam. On July 25, the day
after the fast of Tisha B'Av, a mass ascent to the location is planned.
Among the thousands who are expected to take part, the five families are not
planning just to visit or to make a protest march, but rather to take up
residence - unless the army stops them, in which case they plan to try
again.

Four other locations are being planned as well.  Two of them, Elon Moreh and
Kedumim, are in the Shomron, while another one is south of Gush Etzion along
the road to Kiryat Arba, and a fourth is in Hashmonaim near Modiin.  The
organizers have experience in grassroots settlement campaigns; they
organized the construction of 21 outposts a year and a half ago in various
locations throughout Judea and Samaria.

Land of Israel Faithful spokesperson Datia Yitzchaki, formerly of Kfar Yam
in Gush Katif and now living in Efrat, told Arutz-7, &quot;We've had enough
hiding behind protective walls and defensiveness and withdrawals.  It's time
to reclaim the pioneering spirit we once had, and start populating the Land
again.&quot;

In addition, another group - former residents of Disengagement-destroyed
Homesh in northwestern-Shomron - is planning to begin rebuilding the town on
Tuesday, July 17.  Two organizers, Akiva Smutritch and Yossi Dagan, write in
this week's B'Sheva,

&quot;It is practically two years since the expulsion... The time for action has
come.  We have the opportunity to repair.  As we face the swamp of despair,
corruption, decay and loss of path in which the country has been sinking in
recent years, a new breeze is beginning to blow - one of values, Judaism and
Zionism declaring out loud: The Nation of Israel Lives! ... We can now enter
the driver's seat and turn the wheel in a different direction. There is no
better place to start the change than from the northern Shomron - and Homesh
first!   The area [unlike Gush Katif] is still under IDF control, the roads
and sidewalks are still there, the IDF continues to patrol, and the trees
and flowers continue to bloom, waiting for the Jews to return and water
them...  Our leaders' pride and shame at admitting their mistake is the only
thing holding us up. But ever since we began our campaign to return to
Homesh, a new spirit has begun to take hold in the public, one that says
that the terrible fiasco of two years ago can and must be fixed.  It's just
a matter of time; it is up to us.&quot;

3. The New Diplomats: Hamas Prisoners Now Negotiate on Shalit Swap

by Hana Levi Julian

Hamas terrorist leaders serving sentences in Israeli jails will be the ones
to decide which fellow prisoners will be short-listed for freedom in
exchange for the release of kidnapped IDF Cpl. Gilad Shalit.

Hamas legislator Ayman Dawarma said in an interview published Friday in the
Persian Gulf newspaper Al-Halij that the jailed terrorists have been
authorized to negotiate directly with Israeli officials on the prisoner swap
deal.

The talks are &quot;at the moment in the hands of the Hamas prisoners,&quot; said
Dawarme, adding that senior Israeli officials have already met several times
with the terrorist convicts.

Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha confirmed in Gaza earlier in the week that the
meetings had taken place, government-controlled Voice of Israel Radio
reported. But by Friday, the radio station was reporting that Hamas deputy
political bureau head Moussa Abu Marzouk said only Egypt has the authority
to negotiate for Shalit's release. He denied reports of talks by prisoners
or anyone else on the matter.

The issue of how many and which jailed terrorists will be freed in exchange
for the kidnapped soldiers, as well as when and how, has been batted about
with the Palestinian Authority for months. Each time, promised &quot;imminent&quot;
deals fell through.

Egyptian negotiators have had to contend with trying to secure a deal to
free Shalit while also negotiating one failed truce after another between
the Hamas and Fatah factions.

The French Connection
Shalit's family published an open letter to their son Friday in the French
newspaper Le Figaro. The Shalits, along with the families of IDF reservists
Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, who were abducted last year by Hizbullah
terrorists, are hoping to pressure Portugal and France to help save their
sons.

The families flew first to Portugal this week, where they were to meet with
officials from the European Union and the International Red Cross committee.

The three families are set to attend a rally in Paris for the release of
their sons on Sunday, to be followed by meetings on Monday with President
Nicolas Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. Gilad's father Noam
Shalit also holds French citizenship.

The elder Shalit's letter to his son noted that the captive is being held as
a prisoner of war, but is not being allowed &quot;the conventional rights given
to prisoners of war according to international law and according to the
religion of Islam.&quot;

Shalit was seized in Israel during a cross-border raid by a team of three
terrorist groups on June 25, 2006. Four other soldiers were wounded and two
were killed in the attack, which occurred near the Kerem Shalom border
crossing.

4. No Challah for the Sabbath?

by Hillel Fendel

Israel faces a Sabbath without simple, old-fashioned challah, unless the
government allows the bakers to raise prices in accordance with wheat-price
raises.  Fancy sweet challah will be able in any event.

Israel's two largest bakeries, Angel and Berman, stopped baking simple white
and mixed white-and-whole-wheat bread Thursday morning, leaving a bread
shortage felt throughout the country.  And if that wasn't bad enough, it is
also possible that challahs of the simple kind will not be available for the
Sabbath.

The problem is rooted in the fact that the government subsidizes simple
bread and controls its price.  The bakers have a straightforward claim: &quot;The
price of wheat has gone up around the world, and we, accordingly, pay more
for flour. We therefore cannot continue selling the bread at the same
prices.&quot;

The government, however, refuses to allow the price rise.  Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and Trade Minister Eli Yishai of Shas say they cannot allow the
bakers' to solve their problems at the expense of Israel's poor, and signed
an order this week extending the current price schedule for another three
months.

The numbers appear to be inconsequential.  A loaf of simple white bread
costs 3.65 shekels, while challah cost 4.05 shekels.  The bakers are asking
for a half-shekel increase in the price of challah, to 4.55 shekels, while
the government agrees to approve only 20 agorot, to 4.35.  For bread, the
difference is even less.  The government's position is that some of the
requested increase is already covered by automatic subsidies.

Yaron Angel, one of the owners of Angels, told Arutz-7's Hebrew
newsmagazine, &quot;We are continuing to produce baked goods that are not
price-controlled, because we were able to raise the prices.  But we cannot
continue producing bread at previous prices, when the cost of wheat has
jumped 30%... The difference for the consumer would be only about 7 shekels
a month; when we see gas prices jumping every month, and the like, the Trade
Minister's campaign on behalf of the poor appears ridiculous and populistic.
If he is really concerned for them, there are other things he could do to
help them.&quot;

Angel said that about 40% of his company's production is price-controlled
bread and challah.

The &quot;Orot Hesed&quot; (Lights of Kindness) charity organization has asked the
government to intervene so that challah will be available for the Sabbath.
&quot;Sabbath is coming, and action must be taken now so that needy families will
have challah for Sabbath,&quot; the organization announced.

Similarly, &quot;Latet&quot; (To Give) announced, &quot;With a million citizens in
immediate need of food and other items, the country must make it clear that
at least food staples won't cost more.&quot;

5. Sderot Solidarity Convoys From All Around the Country

by Nissan Ratzlav-Katz

Following through on a pledge they made in late May, a dedicated cadre of
volunteers from the central-Israel city of Modiin has organized a large,
multi-city solidarity trip to rocket-besieged Sderot. Leaving on Friday
morning, the convoy is expected to include hundreds of vehicles, with people
coming from at least 16 different points around the nation to show their
solidarity with the southern city.
Participants in the convoy will be doing some &quot;solidarity shopping&quot; at local
Sderot businesses.

The objective of the group trip is to provide the residents of Sderot with
both moral and material support. Participants in the convoy will be doing
some &quot;solidarity shopping&quot; at local Sderot businesses, which have been hit
hard by the ongoing Palestinian Authority attacks on the city. In addition,
the visiting shoppers will be donating food and basic supplies for those
people in Sderot who have been unable to obtain them on their own.

According to Efrat Klein, one of the solidarity convoy organizers, &quot;All the
shop owners in Sderot know we're coming, and they're very moved. It looks
like all of Sderot will be out there waiting for us.&quot;

Danny Dahan, the head of the Sderot Business Forum, said Thursday that he
was encouraged by the initiative. He noted that many local businesses are
literally on the verge of collapse.

Iki Elner, a resident of Sderot, told Arutz Sheva Radio, &quot;This is a
necessary initiative. The economic difficulties in the face of the Kassam
rocket attacks are more and more serious. Trade in the city is becoming more
and more infrequent. Residents of towns in the region around Sderot used to
come into the city for shopping, but now they don't come anymore and the
economic hardship is getting worse. This is a blessed initiative. And I am
now myself trying to promote a wandering bazaar of Sderot merchants that
will travel to the surrounding communities.&quot;

Friday's solidarity shopping trip is actually the second of its kind. A
previous convoy, like the current one, was a completely private initiative
by Modiin native Ilan Cohen. It took place on May 29
&lt; http://trailer.web-view.net/Links/0X2CCFFCD7F93E7D7DCF8BC3BEA96D66E98...
8EB88FBA744CE3EF2FE46B51AB25D55597746256BF1888DF2BF1408292059D4608E46745B81 8
6735DBD637488.htm&gt; , initially included approximately two dozen cars, and
was just a single-city project. However, at the end of that excursion, Cohen
committed himself to organizing a bigger follow-up trip, adding, &quot;If Modiin
has succeeded in doing this, then other cities will do this, too, until it
becomes a mass event.&quot; It appears that Cohen's determination is about to pay
off for the residents of Sderot.

The vehicular caravans, heading out in the early morning from their various
points of origin, will converge in Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, south of Ashkelon.
From there, they will join together in one long convoy, with a police
escort, for the entry into Sderot. Once in the city, according to trip
organizers, &quot;We will drive through the streets and show the residents that
all of Israel is Sderot.&quot;

Sderot Business Forum chairman Dahan said that, aside from
&quot;All of Israel is Sderot!&quot;
private initiatives such as that of Ilan Cohen, he and his fellow forum
members have called on the government to help. The state funds provided in
the past, Dahan explained, were inadequate to provide real assistance.

Elner agreed: &quot;We need more than hugs and support from Ra'anana, Ramat
HaSharon and other towns. We need a guiding hand for all this support. If
there was a local committee for rebuilding the city, then further shopping
trips and sympathetic support would be more properly carried out.&quot;

As for the team behind Friday's solidarity shopping trip, they told Arutz-7,
&quot;We are not giving up on Sderot!&quot;

6. Gaydamak Buys Bikur Cholim, Will Keep it Operating

by Ezra HaLevi

Billionaire oleh [immigrant to Israel] Arcady Gaydamak has won the tender
for Jerusalem's legendary, yet aging, Bikur Cholim Hospital.

Gaydamak paid $32 million for the central Jerusalem hospital. He was outbid
at the last minute by former partner and shopping mall kingpin Lev Levayev -
but won out, because whereas Levayev planned to phase out operations of the
hospital, transforming it into a real estate project, Gaydamak promises not
to dismiss any staff and to rehabilitate and invest in the aging facility.
The hospital was being liquidated after it fell into almost $50 million of
debt, leading investors to prefer the idea of using the prime location for
lucrative real estate rather than continuing to compete with Jerusalem's
three other large, state-of-the-art hospitals.

Another bidder was the hareidi-religious US-based Herzberg Group, which also
intended to continue operating the hospital. The group of businessmen and
philanthropists failed to match Gaydamak's bid, however.

The rehabilitation and continued operation of Bikur Cholim is a feat sure to
win Gaydamak support among Jerusalem's hareidi-religious population, which
has been worried about the hospital's future.  The hospital serves much of
Jerusalem's religious population residing within a close radius, as well as
the rest of the city's populace.

Days before he submitted his bid, Gaydamak met with the head of the
hareidi-religious Eida Hareidit Rabbi Yitzchak Tuvia Weiss, and promised him
the hospital would be operated in accordance with Jewish law and
cutting-edge technology.

Gaydamak has already announced his intention to run for Mayor of Jerusalem
in the next elections. The announcement resulted in a legislative effort by
MK Ran Cohen (Meretz), and supported by 13 MKs, to tailor a law that would
ban Gaydamak from the Knesset.

The businessman wrote a sardonic response to the proposed law, published in
several Israeli papers:

&quot;Any Israeli citizen may run for the Knesset, be he Russian, Moroccan or
Yemenite Jew, blond, brunette, redhead or bald. Even a rich bloke may enter
the Knesset - unless he shares his wealth with others.

&quot;If a man helped the poor, he should be kept out of the Knesset. If he
donated to the IDF or Magen David Adom, he should not be allowed to darken
the Knesset's doors. If he provided for the elderly and needy, if he saved
children from bombardment, he has no place in the Knesset.

&quot;Thus spake Ran Cohen: Only those who have done nothing for their fellow
citizens may run for the Knesset. Only they are above suspicion. Only they
will never bribe a voter, for they did not succumb to the temptation to
share of their wealth. Bravo, Ran! Bravo, your 13 supporters! .

&quot;Elsewhere, wealthy people do share their wealth with less fortunate fellow
citizens. Originally this was a Jewish custom, called tzedaka. In the Jewish
state, it is 'prohibited.' All over the world, generosity is considered to
be a virtue, but in Israel, it is a fault.

&quot;Some MKs feel threatened by the remote chance of an independent
philanthropist being elected to the Knesset. Such an elected member may
establish a totally different, higher standard of service. An Israeli voter
may learn to expect reasonable laws, just decisions, objective committees
and full commitment to the well-being of Israeli society rather than to the
MK's well-being.&quot;

7. New Stamps in Israel: Kindness, Dance, and More

by Hillel Fendel

The Israel Philatelic Service issued nine new stamps
&lt; http://web02.postil.com/postboolaee.nsf/HanpakotViewEng?openview&amp;L;=EN &gt;  in
four series in the month of June.  The new stamps honor themes as diverse as
Volunteer Organizations in Israel, the Israel Prison Service, the UNESCO
World Heritage Sites in Israel, and Dance.

The UNESCO series honors the five Israeli sites or locations that appear on
the United Nations' list of world heritage places recommended for
protection. Three of the sites appear on specific stamps: Massada, on a
stamp worth 5.80 shekels; the White City of Tel Aviv (a neighborhood
recognized for its Modern Movement architecture and town planning), a
5-shekel issue; and the city of Acre (Acco), for 3.30 shekels.  Two other
UNESCO sites in Israel - the Incense Route of Negev desert cities and
Biblical tells Megiddo, Hatzor, and Be'er Sheva - do not appear on specific
stamps.

Volunteer organizations in Israel were also honored with a stamp in June,
worth 1.50 shekels - the price of sending a standard domestic letter.  The
tab reads, &quot;For a better world,&quot; while the first-day cover states, &quot;All of
Israel is responsible one for another.&quot;

The explanatory literature
&lt; http://trailer.web-view.net/Links/0X54B88147298ADEABEC7F1EAF3F6491547...
FCA5B3FCBF50122D05490B99748DF7AACAB8D6844F1888DF2BF1408292059D4608E46745B81 8
6735DBD637488.htm&gt;  states that nearly 15,000 volunteer organizations
operate in Israel on a local or national scope.  Examples are Yad Sarah
(providing free loans of medical equipment), Zaka (Rescue and Save), Enosh
(Israel Mental Health Association), Magen David Adom, Honenu (legal
representation) and local community charity organizations.  In addition, in
many neighborhoods in Israel, arrangements known as Gmachin provide free
services and loans of items as diverse as baby pacifiers and carriages,
medicines, ladders, carpentry equipment, house-cleaning, baby-sitting,
wedding paraphernalia, and much more.

Another philatelic issuance this past month, for 2.50 shekels, honors the
Israel Prison Service.  Employing 7,000 workers and responsible for over
24,000 security and criminal prisoners, the IPS is a component of Israel's
security forces.  It began as a department of the Israel Police in May 1948,
but became an independent body in January 1949.

Four stamps worth 2.20 shekels each were issued in June on various dance
styles: ballet, ethnic dance, Israeli folk dance, and modern dance.

In May, one new stamp was issued, in honor of the 40th Anniversay of
Jerusalem's reunification, including a special souvenir leaf.  The previous
month, eight new stamps were issued, on the themes of Memorial Day,
Centenary of World Scouting, Development Towns (three stamps), and the
commemoration of 120 years of Neve Tzedek (three stamps).  Neve Tzedek was
the first neighborhood in Jaffa outside the Old City walls; Rabbi Avraham
Kook lived there when he first arrived in the Holy Land and became Rabbi of
Jaffa and the Moshavot.

8. Freedom of the Press, PA Style

by Hana Levi Julian

Foreign journalists have often become pawns in the game of &quot;chicken&quot; often
played out between Arab terrorists and their international opponents, but
local reporters are usually considered off-limits.

Not so in Palestinian Authority-controlled Gaza, where local reporters are
beginning to panic, with good reason.

The release this week of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) journalist
Alan Johnston after four months of captivity by Gaza terrorists has not
changed the dangerous situation in which Gaza journalists find themselves.

According to a report in Newsweek magazine, more than 30 local journalists
were attacked last month in Hamas-controlled Gaza and in Fatah-controlled
Judea and Samaria. Three have been killed so far this year.

The Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms (Mada) warned
Hamas and Fatah officials in a recent statement to &quot;order their armed forces
to stop attacks on journalists and media institutions.&quot;

Gaza journalists are forced to deal with conditions that will inevitably
affect the way they cover stories in the region, said the organization.
&quot;Mada center is expressing [its] serious concern over the deteriorating
situation in the Palestinian arena in general and the state of media
freedoms in particular..&quot;

The organization also had words of warning for PA Arab journalists to &quot;avoid
[being] aligned to a party at the expense of another and the need to be
objective and impartial in their professional work. [and] commit to
professional standards.&quot;

One month ago, Arab terrorists stormed the offices of the Palmedia news
agency offices in Gaza City, shooting in the air and taking away its
computer and transmission equipment.

No Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces intervened, although security
headquarters are located within 60 yards of the media office, according to
the Reporters without Borders organization. Twenty journalists were in the
offices at the time, but no one was injured.

In April, PA police officers attacked Arab journalists who were
participating in a rally for Johnston's release near the PA Legislative
Council building in Gaza. Several of the journalists were injured by police,
who used rifles to push them away, threatening to shoot them if they
returned to the area.

Foreign Journalists: Gaza 'No Go' Zone
Meanwhile, Gaza has been unofficially declared a &quot;no go&quot; zone among foreign
journalists, who say kidnappings and attacks on reporters have gone too far,
and PA officials not far enough.

Foreign journalists are becoming an increasingly endangered species,
continuing to quietly stream out of Gaza in recent months as the risk of
life-threatening attacks and kidnappings skyrockets. BBC reporter Alan
Johnston was the last holdout to maintain a full-time bureau office in Gaza
City. It was outside that office that he was kidnapped at gunpoint on March
12. Johnston was finally released this week, almost four months after his
abduction.

The continuing saga has left the Gaza area without foreign journalists and
is damaging the reputation of the Palestinian Authority, according to Simon
McGregor-Wood of ABC News, Chairman of the Foreign Press Association in
Jerusalem. &quot;Gaza for most of the foreign press corps has become a no-go
zone,&quot; said McGregor-Wood.

A number of network news reporters have been kidnapped within the past year.
Most were released immediately; an exception was last summer's kidnapping of
two Fox News journalists. Sixty-year-old American Steve Centanni and his
36-year-old cameraman Olaf Wiig of New Zealand were held for two weeks by a
Hamas-linked group called the Holy Jihad Brigades.

Associated Press photographer Emiliio Morenatti, an Italian national, was
kidnapped in October 2006, also in Gaza City and released unharmed 15 hours
later.

The most recent occurrence prior to Johnston's abduction involved a
50-year-old Peruvian photographer with the French news agency Agence France
Presse (AFP). Jaime Razuri was abducted by masked gunmen in January and
released a week later.
