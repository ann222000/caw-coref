I have not operated a TIG machine since I was in my early 20s (now
approaching my 40s), and back then we had a shop manager that kept our parts
available for us.

Recently, I purchased a TIG torch for an Inverter machine, so I will be
limited to DC welding (no aluminum).

My TIG torch is the Lincoln PTA-17V, and won on eBay:
http://www.mylincolnelectric.com/Catalog/equipmentdatasheet.asp?p=562

How do I select tungsten?

Looking in Harbor Freight's catalog, I see 2 options for 1/16&quot; tungsten:
1) #93724-0 - EWTH-2 &quot;1.7-2.2% thorium dioxide&quot;
2) #93725-0 - EWCE-2 &quot;1.8-2.2% cerium oxide&quot;

What's the difference between thorium dioxide and cerium oxide? The price is
the same. Is one for aluminum and one for steel?

Here is part 2:
I have an argon/CO2 tank that I use for MIG. Since I do not intend to do a
lot of TIG or MIG, I had planned to use this same cylinder for TIG welding.
However, a guy at the local welding store said that I must use argon only
for TIG welding and that I needed a separate meter for TIG welding than the
meter I had for my MIG setup. I've never heard this! Is this true? I see
meters on eBay that say they are for MIG and TIG, so I think the guy at the
welding store did not know what he was talking about. Can someone verify
this?

I would be somewhat hesitant to buy tungstens from HF.

Here are some notes from one of Ernie's recent TIG class lectures:

Tungstens

Only 4 companies actually make tungstens. Ernie cautions that some companies
have poor quality assurance especially on the outside diameter tolerance.

Pure Tungsten
Don't use pure tungsten except when you're welding pop cans. Pure tungsten
gives the smoothest arc of any electrode.

DC only: 2% thoriated
Works OK, but thoria is radioactive so you can be exposed when grinding it.
May go off the market soon.

AC/DC:

Lanthanated: works on steel, stainless or aluminum
Ernie recommends 1.5% or 1% because he says he thinks the 2% has QA issues

Ceriated: also works on most metals, but won't take as much current
useful for really thin stuff because it will start an arc with the lowest
amperage of any tungsten

AC only (esp. high amperage): Zirconiated
Buy 1/8&quot; in whatever doping percentage they come in, Ernie suggests, and
use these in high amperage AC applications like aluminum.

Of interest also are &quot;triple strike&quot; tungstens by Huntington Fusion - these
are supposedly doped with lanthanum, cerium, and zircon.

Tungsten Grinding

For roughing, use a silicon carbide (green) wheel. For fine, use AlOx in
about 120 grit. These go well on the 2 sides of a bench grinder. Or, you can
use a sanding belt, the blue kind (ZrAlOx) to rough quickly, and a diamond
wheel for touching up or polishing.

The ideal angle is about like a pencil, and you don't want it dead sharp for
any job requiring 150 amps or more. The tip can erode and fall off and wind
up in the weld, where Ernie says it is like &quot;a marble in cookie dough&quot;. As
the weld flexes, it can tear around the tungsten inclusions.

He's partly correct. You can't use a gas that's part CO2 for TIG. But your
flowmeter will work fine for a straight argon cylinder.

Look an Ebay for tungstens. Nothing against Harbor Freight, but I
think you can get a better price and selection on Ebay.

the &quot;thorium is radioactive&quot; concern is junk

So is carbon so is graphite so are smoke detectors

Last i checked the half life of thorium is 15 billion years. That
means that it takes almost 3 times the age of the earth for thorium to
give off half its radiation

Uranium 235 (Fuel uranium) gives off half its radiation in 500 years
(Half life)

Polonium 135 (the russian spy killer form last year) gives off half
its radiation in something like 3 months

And inactive U235 fuel rod pellets are safe to handle (they also weigh
more than a tungsten)

Just because it gives off &quot;radiation&quot; doesnt make it dangerous

if that was the case cigarettes would have been banned decades ago
since they do send radioactive meterials directly into the bloodstream
through the lungs.

There are many labs dealing with actual &quot;radioactive materials&quot; and
once that can actually be dangerous

If the government and nuclear regulatory bodies don't require the
users of thoriated tungsten to be registered and issued a &quot;Dosimeter&quot;
youre safe from the radiation side.

Dont get me wrong its not good to inhale tungsten but dont blame the
radiation. Heavy metal contamination and the associated &quot;grinder
scuzz&quot; will hurt your health LONG before the &quot;radiation&quot; of thoria
alminium and iron oxide and tungsten and oter associate chemicals
thrown off the grinder are always best left out of your lungs.

Howdy!  I'm a weldor at PSNS, so I don't know how well this applies to
the real world....

We use the same flowmeters for four different shielding gases- just
rotate the floating ball chamber until you see the correct guage
markings.

Do not use CO2 in your gas mix for tig, unless it is a very small
percentage (like 1% or less).  It's not as bad as forgetting your
shielding gas (tungsten goes puff in a yellow haze), but you will see
some very quick degredation of your tungsten.  Shop 26 uses pure argon
for virtually all tig work, with a few special applications using 95/5
argon/helium, or custom mixing stations for exotic metals.

Remember, grind your tungsten longitudinally, not radially.  Put a
pencil point on it, then take the sharp tip off the point.  I've got a
tungsten in my torch that's lasted me for several months now, but
admittedly I only get a tig assignment about once a week.

Lanthanated- Yuk!  We don't like it at PSNS, and it is no longer in use
here after a short trial period.

2% Thoriated- Great stuff, we use it all the time, and while it is
radioactive and will set off the detectors, it is not so radioactive as
to pose a risk to personnel.

Just wear your respirator while you grind it.

LOW POINT VENT!! Argon is heavier than air, and if you are doing any
work in any kind of depression, be sure to vent out the argon- it will
displace O2 and kill you before you realize what is happening.

Hey TinLizzied,

Ok, so I need the pure Argon for TIG so that I don't burn up my tungsten.

Any idea why I can't use the same pure Argon for MIG?

No, that is 703 million years, otherwise there would be not enough left on
earth for it to be a practical nuclear fuel.

Just comparing the half life of the different elements gives an incomplete
picture.  You could be holding several grams of thorium atoms in a pack of
tungstens, which is a much, much larger number of atoms than the americum
in a smoke detector etc.  and even the smoke detector would be quite
unhealthy if you ground it up and inhaled it.  If you borrow a geiger
counter and hold it near the thoriated rods, you will notice quite a lot of
clicking, compared to any other common object that you would allow to enter
your body.

I don't see the connection - cigarettes do kill people.  The reason that
they are not banned is not because they don't kill people, it's because
some people like smoking them, and other people like selling them.

Well if there is an alternative rod that is just as good for welding as the
thoriated rod, then why not use it?  Are the alternatives any good?

I for one wish that I had not used thoriated rods in the past - especially
because I was not much good at welding so I did quite a bit of grinding!

Carbon by nature can be made but isn't naturally.  Graphite likewise.

The half life means this : During the first half most of the radiation
is active and by the half life the dose is 1/2 the value.

Therefore you want a half life of 3.5 years and in 4 and 8 years it might be
safer.  The watches that used heavy water sort to speak was 3.5 years.
They started to get dark and then after the 2x or 7 the watch still worked
but the background was to dark to see.

It doesn't take half of the lifetime to give it off - it decays to
half intensity.

Alpha particles won't get into the skin or paper.  It is to thick.
However the small thin layers in the lung can be passed through.
So the rad stuff in cigs does get people and contribute to the cancer.

Beta goes through skin and then some it can kill.

Gamma goes through the body and through thick layers of some materials.

The best Neutron absorber - e.g. shield from a strong 'bullet' is paraffin wax.
Concrete block and wax and other chemicals are better shields.

&gt; If the government and nuclear regulatory bodies don't require the

&gt; youre safe from the radiation side.

No you are wrong again.  Go ahead for yourself.
One simply doesn't do what can hurt themselves.  Like sound - often they
are late.  And some places have laws for protection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Dont get me wrong its not good to inhale tungsten but dont blame the

Howdy!  You can use pure argon for mig, but you will note a difference
in how your beads run.  When I did my pulse tests, we used a mix of 95%
argon, 5% CO2.  This gave us a good bead profile, good penetration, low
spatter, and in general it just &quot;ran&quot; better than pure argon.  For spray
we used the same mix, and the results were again better than running
pure argon.

We were using gas mixers, and we got to play around a little with our
settings just so we could see why the shipyard has specified what mix we
use on the waterfront.

If you would like some photos of what the difference is in how the beads
look and what kind of penetration you get, I'm sure I could either find
them in my books or call up my trade instructor and ask him if I could
borrow a pic or two...

Try it out!  If you have a decent vendor, they may well be willing to
set up an experiment for you, or you can go to most any place that
teaches welding (here in Bremerton, Olympic College) and I'm sure they
would be happy to not just explain what you should use but also be able
to show you why.

Martin,

Fellow physics guy here. I only went as far as my BS at the University of
Texas in Arlington (UTA).

Took my first year of grad school thinking I'd get the harder stuff our of
the way first: Quantum Mechanics, Math Methods, Thermodynamics, and
Classical Electricity and Magnetism. The titles to these courses mimicked
classes I had completed as an undergrad. Ha! Going off the axis introduced
hours and hours of extra mathematics!

I finished the year with a C average, losing my Teaching Assistantship and
grants.

The department told me I could write a letter requesting to be re-admitted
and that loans were available to me, but that wasn't for me.

So, I dropped out and I've been working as a Software Engineer ever since.

Quick stuff here

F=M * A   or Force of impact = Mass * Acceleration

To get the force needed to slam through 4 to 6&quot; of armor plate
one either has to have a very very fast (hard to do) object, or
a massive one.  We don't want to throw a truck at 10,000 miles/hour at it
so they make a bullet that weighs like a truck and fire it
from a big shell going as fast as they can without meltdown.

Using depleted is the heaviest material logical to use.

Yes some of it is splattered but most is in one direction.  Since it can
be detected, it is easy to track down.  Remember it hits and continues
through a hole it melts on the way.  So it is mostly contained if hits.
Those that hit sand get caught and few if any glance off and go crazy.

The teams also recover all of the parts - every chunk - of our tanks -
those blown or just knocked off.  The special metal and composite is secret.

After this is all done, then the metal scroungers are let in.  They have
already bid on the projects to get the good steel and sell it off to
someone.  In the process of cleaning a war field.

There is a caliber design called .300 Whisper   They are .308's and are
heavy bullets.  They fly with a velocity of 1000 ft/sec.  Sub sonic.
Another use of a big bullet, but sloooow   so it is doesn't crack the sound
barrier and crack when shot.

Gosh Physics at an Engineering school - how could you :-)

I was mostly an E&amp;M Electro &amp; Magnetic type.  Was moving into High Energy

I'd have to get out the books but that in general doesn't sound right.

I can have some really hot very long life stuff that burns forever almost
and some short stuff that isn't nearly as hot and depletes it self
in a short time.

E&amp;M was always my favorite subject (although gravity was becoming more and
more interesting).

My main problem was that I never could see the symmetry when it came to
solving the math problems. If the problem said there was an infinitely long
line charge, I *always* tried to calculate the charge from theta = 0 to pi.
On homework problems, I could see the symmetry and just treat it as a point
source - but not come test time!

Though I loved E&amp;M, there aren't really any studies going on in that area
these days. I spent most of my time hanging out with the High Energy guys
there: Dr. Andrew White and Dr. Ransom Stephens. Of course, that was back
when they were still building the super collider that eventually became the
big abandoned hole in the ground.

So, what do you do with physics these days? Are you a Welding Engineer? I
was trained to be a welder before college while I was in the Marine Corps.
Had I known there was such a field as a Welding Engineer back then when I
was going to college, I certainly would have gone that route! Career
councilors that the government uses aren't worth a crap. They only know 5 to
10 of the big main areas that people typically go into. I spoke with them to
try to find out what I'd be good going into. I told them I was interested in
physics, so they said I should go into physics. {sigh} Idiots.

Saw your post above about &quot;Force of Impact = M * A.&quot; I suppose whenever a
mass suddenly stops, it does have an instant negative acceleration, but it
seems like a better expression would be for the kinetic energy: KE = 1/2 M *
V^2. Your formula works out to be the same after taking the derivative of
mine, so its just a preference. F = MA is certainly more common! :)

I haven't talked physics in years!

I just finished (tonight) cutting out 4 12x12 squares with 2&quot; round corners and
will weld a pipe flange in the center (post cleaning and acid washing both the
1/4&quot; steel and flanges.  For an artist type doing something with balloons...

I use Hf as a electron and element source blasting out of my plasma torch.
It was a hobby that I make a little money on the side to keep life fun.
My wife and several art types are biggest customers. But I ship targets
Nation wide.

Write a little and give advice.  Fix stuff and design a few things.

Give my dad the biggest push - keep his mind and mine going - he gets back - I
send something about the machine in Cern and I get &quot;String Theory and M-Theory&quot;
Becker(s) and Schwarz for 'light' reading in return!

Serve as a science adviser to one group and just completed being a Science
adviser to a private school.  We moved.  It was into Hydrogen fuel cells
and got :-) a department of Energy a grant for research.  Mostly development,
investigation and nation wide display and use.  I built the test gear
that verified operation and measurement points.

But being an IC and PCB designer which both jobs (overlapping) required
some high tech understanding.  Use of Smith charts and exotic instruments
was my game.  Solving a problem of whatever.

I was trained to think.  To observe and think. Provide solutions or pathways
to a solution.

But lately, being semi-retired, I'm a Conchologist, metal cutter/welder, cabinet
maker and having fun re-loading using my high tech scale.

Oh - I do send email to department and division heads back at school -
the division head was starting his teaching about the time I graduated.
I sent them how to generate ball lighting in the lab.  That was something
that might be fun and a good experiment.
