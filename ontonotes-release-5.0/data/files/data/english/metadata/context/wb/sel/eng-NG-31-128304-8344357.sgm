I think people have to toughen up.  We paid a lot of money on our
deposits.  This is our new home.  I don't believe we should take any
s--- .  If you want something, don't go through your lawyer or their
lawyers.  Deal directly with the sales office and be very stern if you
have to.  There's nothing they can do but give you what you legally
deserve.  There is no reason to be treated as if they are doing us a
favor allowing you buy the apartment. If you have big problems, call
the NJ Attorney Generals Office and talk to the Consumers Dept.  Look
them up on the web.  Call the local newspapers, tell them what's
happening.  Call the mayor of JC, if he's not in a bar.

I suggest that everyone read their contract again. The &quot;Beacon&quot; has
built in a lot of extra time and may be within the law on a particular
issue.  For instance, the contract states that a walkthrough can be
scheduled 72 hours before closing and they've been scheduling people 2
dyas before.  Say NO - contract states 72 hours.  To inform people of
a new walk-through or closing date a few days before you were to close
originally is bad business and just plain rude..
I would demand housing.

I am supposed to have a walk-through on the 14th and close on the
17th.  I will let you know what happens.  So far I have been very
demanding and did not wait for their letter to arrive.  I had my
attorney call their attorneys &amp; they took care of everything right
away.  The front office is so unorganized they didn't know what my
dates were.

Hi Mare,

I have to agree with you.  The builders were allowed to have up to a 6
month delay, but only due to very specific reasons.  No explaination
was ever given when they started delaying.  Other builders atleast
write to their buyers and explain in detail why a delay is occurring.
I had to throw everything in storage and get temporary housing.  I am
extremely disappointed to hear that they are calling people on the day
of their scheduled walk through to let them know the unit is not
ready.  It also concerns me, because this just means they are just
rushing to get things done, and when that happens, quality goes down
the drain.

Also, don't always trust the sales office to have the correct
information.  I called them several times when I moved and they
assured me that they would update my address with their law firm.
Surprise, my closing letter gets sent to my old address, and was
luckily forwarded to me.  This was a month after I called the sales
office and let them know.  So I then called the sales office again, to
make sure they had my correct address.  They had it, but they never
told the lawyers.  The next week, I call their lawyers about something
else, and when they read back my address, its my old one.  Their law
office even told me to just contact them directly about such things
because this seems to happen alot.

I like to have a positive attitude, so I am glad to hear the feedback
on this group and that there are some happy campers already in the
building.  I really hope that their aren't anymore surprises or
delays.  Everyone, keep sharing your experiences good or bad.  I also
hope that all their &quot;rushing&quot; to get things done doesn't equate to
major infrastructure or building problems later on.  We can definitely
pick up on cosmetic things during a walkthrough, but its whats behind
the walls that concerns me.

To be fair on the walkthrough timing, the purchase contract I signed
actually stipulates that such walkthrough should be scheduled WITHIN
72 weekday hours prior to closing.  So it seems the sales office is
within their rights to schedule these inspections within 24 to 48
hours of closing, as has been their communicated preference (give or
take a day based on the buyer's schedule).  Having said that, I do
agree that we as buyers and future residents should hold the developer
accountable for any negative issues that arise.  What happened to S.
on his walkthrough is unacceptable and I very much hope that The
Beacon has done something to make it right for him (i.e. paid lodging,
storage, etc.). While some of the timing issues the developer has
experienced seem to be the norm with new construction, and have likely
been exacerbated by the fact that it is a historic landmark structure,
it is my hope that they get back on track from a timing and buyer
satisfaction standpoint.

I agree with you &quot;L&quot; - I too am trying to keep a positive attitude.
Restoring the architectural integrity of a landmark building means
preserving and rebuilding the outside, plumbing, electricity, wiring,
waste, bringing the building up to code and a lot of other
responsibilities.  It takes a long time.  We all understand this.
We've been waiting...
We are upset.  We should have been notified of delays, we should not
have to call the office to ask what's going on.  It not only shows a
lack of respect for the buyer, it is bad business, a negative
reflection of the building and Metrovest.  We all have lives, jobs and
move-outs to schedule.  We all have storage problems, etc.  The least
Metrovest could do is offer people storage in an empty facility until
move in.  Haven't they noticed they are scewing with our lives?
I am moving from NYC.  I bought this place pre-construction 24
years ago, so it was a totally different experience.  The mgmt. let us
come whenever we wanted to see the progress.  It made us feel secure
and welcomed.  We started on the right foot, were a team - Mgmt. and
the owners.  It's still this way.  That's the way it should start, not
with confusion and fear.   All the amenities in the world won't make
up for being treated like chattel.

Okay--I am still waiting. UPS apologized but sent my package back to merchant after I gave distinct directions and descriptions AND after two attempts when they are supposed to make three.  FEDEX is supposed to be here today with a different order. IF I do not receive my delivery today (I can not drive) I will send my deliveries to the office.  They get paid to take care of headaches----oooops---am I sounding frustrated?

of this bad news, as you are an extended neighbor and should be
getting better service and treatment.  Hang in there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was ever given when they started delaying. Other builders atleast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write to their buyers and explain in detail why a delay is occurring.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had to throw everything in storage and get temporary housing. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely disappointed to hear that they are calling people on the day
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of their scheduled walk through to let them know the unit is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready. It also concerns me, because this just means they are just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rushing to get things done, and when that happens, quality goes down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the drain.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, don't always trust the sales office to have the correct
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information. I called them several times when I moved and they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assured me that they would update my address with their law firm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surprise, my closing letter gets sent to my old address, and was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luckily forwarded to me. This was a month after I called the sales
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and let them know. So I then called the sales office again, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make sure they had my correct address. They had it, but they never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told the lawyers. The next week, I call their lawyers about something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else, and when they read back my address, its my old one. Their law
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office even told me to just contact them directly about such things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because this seems to happen alot.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like to have a positive attitude, so I am glad to hear the feedback
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on this group and that there are some happy campers already in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; building. I really hope that their aren't anymore surprises or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delays. Everyone, keep sharing your experiences good or bad. I also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope that all their &quot;rushing&quot; to get things done doesn't equate to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major infrastructure or building problems later on. We can definitely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick up on cosmetic things during a walkthrough, but its whats behind
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the walls that concerns me.- Hide quoted text -
