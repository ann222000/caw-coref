I'm not a Mac user.

I'm a Linux user that may be sending a lot of files to a few Mac users.

I'd like to know what compression formats OS X supports &quot;out of the box&quot;.

I understand you can compress/decompress gzipped tarballs in a terminal,
but I'm specifically wanting to know what you can do outside of a
terminal (just in the GUI).

My first guesses would be compressing/decompressing .zip .gz and .tar.gz.

Is that correct?

TIA

Those all work fine. You can just double-click, and the file will
decompress.

There are also compressed disk images (.dmg) which is how most software
is distributed for the Mac now, and which you double-click to mount. You
can create them on any OS X Mac with the Disk Utility program.

Keep in mind the only one you can *create* through the Mac OS X
graphical user interface is a ZIP file (right-click an item and choose
Create Archive).  To create a TAR or TGZ, you'd need to use a
third-party utility or the command line.

Cool. Now how about the opposite? Compressing a file.

Those I'm aware of, but I'm speaking in terms of cross-platform
functionality.

Thanks

The CLI and GUI work together nicely for this though. If you drag a file
or folder into a &quot;terminal window,&quot; the OS will write out the path for
you. So you can

tar cvf foo.tar [now drag your file in]

Bzip2 works as well.

My Mac using friend is old school Mac and therefore
&quot;command-line-challanged&quot;.

In fact, she still prefers OS 9 over OS X.....
