Once again, more evidence that words on the cover are MORE enticing, more
often than pure pictures alone:

Ohhhh.  I thought &quot;One More Day&quot; referred to &quot;what is you could have
one more day than you previously had&quot;.  Like what if you had one more
day to spend with Uncle Ben, something like that.

I didn't know it meant &quot;What if you only had one more day&quot; as in
something is going to end in 24 hours...

I like the classic style covers for this.  They really caught my eye,
giving me the feel that this was a story like I used to get off the
spinner rack 30 years ago.  Knowing the premise of it just feels me
full of dread since someone is not coming out of this alive when the
story is over.  I think that means the covers work very well.

&quot;...and the Marvel Universe will never be the same again! &quot;

Uh, yeah.  According to Marvel marketing, isn't just about *every*
storyline one in which &quot;the Marvel Universe will never be the same
again&quot;?  Marvel Hype seems to find astonishing and awe-inspiring every
time one of Spider-Man's sentences ends with an exclamation point. (!)

I'd be forced to admit that in the last couple of years, this
statement has been more than hype.  House of M and Civil War made
severe repercussions on the landscape of the Marvel Universe, and
there's no reason so far to doubt that &quot;One More Day&quot; won't at least
do *something* drastic to alter Spider-Man's current state.  Argue
good or bad, but in this one point, I think Quesada has delivered as
far as promising actual change.  How lasting any of it will be in the
long term is another question.

I still think the stark white covers convey more through body
languange and smood than the cluttered &quot;look at this!&quot; &quot;and look at
this!&quot; burst and text style.

I like the old-fashioned covers too. Especially that &quot;Still only 399¢&quot; in
the corner. :-)
