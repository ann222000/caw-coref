I have reservations about using chocolate paraffin because of the way I'm afraid it will look.  Does it look like poo?  How chocolatey is the scent?

Thanks

I didn't get paraffin in my pedi line if you are talking to me.  I got the honey scrub, the wash, butter, and foot soak all in chocolate mint.

Wouldn't you be able to scent your wax w/oils?  Mint &amp; chocolate?  All the
fragrance w/o the color of poo?  &gt;G&lt;

You know I thought of that, but I tried scenting some really faint mint wax w/ peppermint oil and it seemed like the heat cooked the smell right out of it.  LOL

I believe I was the one who Michelle was asking about the chocolate
paraffin? My clients love it! It's called "after eight" and smells just like
the chocolate treat after eight. My hands smell like it all day long even
with multiple hand washings. It's got actual cocoa beans in it. Looks good
enough to eat but I wouldn't try it! hehe...doesn't help with the diet
though. makes me crave chocolate all day long! I advertise it as a high
calorie pampering without the worry of gaining weight!
