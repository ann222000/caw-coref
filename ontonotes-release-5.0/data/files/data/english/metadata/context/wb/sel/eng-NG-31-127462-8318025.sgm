Ah, but as Mrbawana would say - let's look on the bright side on this
story.

At least GW isn't causing England to suffer from a summer DROUGHT!

&gt; Flooding Throughout Britain Traps Hundreds

&gt; Saturday,  July 21, 2007
&gt; Associated Press

&gt; LONDON -- Helicopter and boat crews rescued hundreds trapped Saturday
&gt; after storms whipped through Britain, flooding towns and villages,
&gt; including William Shakespeare's picturesque birthplace where waters
&gt; gushed into a theater.

&gt; Motorists slept overnight in cars on rain-lashed highways, while
&gt; others were attempting to find vehicles abandoned on major roads
&gt; Friday after the downpours caused long delays.

&gt; Meteorologists said many areas of Britain had more than a month's
&gt; worth of rain in a few hours Friday and predicted more downpours
&gt; across the weekend.

&gt; &quot;These are the sorts of rainfalls that we experienced in the past
&gt; every 100 years, every 150 years, sometimes every 200 years -- they're
&gt; very extreme, Baroness Barbara Young, chief executive of Britain's
&gt; Environment Agency, told Sky News.

&gt; Weather forecaster MeteoGroup UK, said that Pershore, a town around
&gt; 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of London, was worst hit,
&gt; drenched by 145.4 millimeters (5.72 inches) of rain in 25 hours,
&gt; between Thursday and Friday. Usual levels are 50-60 millimeters (2 to
&gt; 2.3 inches) in a month, the center said.

&gt; Waters rushed into the basement of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, in
&gt; Stratford-upon-Avon, around 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of
&gt; London.

&gt; The theater company, which has two other venues in the town and is
&gt; currently refurbishing the flooded venue, canceled a planned
&gt; performance of &quot;Macbeth&quot; on Saturday, fearing audiences wouldn't be
&gt; able to reach the site.

&gt; &quot;The area where the theaters are is under water,&quot; said spokesman Dean
&gt; Asker. &quot;It's a shame we're not performing &quot;The Tempest,&quot; it would've
&gt; been more appropriate.&quot;

&gt; Royal air force helicopters rescued more the 100 people from rooftops
&gt; of flooded villages and around 2,000 people spent Friday night in
&gt; emergency shelters in Gloucestershire, a county in southwest England.

&gt; &quot;I've never seen torrential rain like this, the weather has been
&gt; freakish across the whole of the country,&quot; said Parmjit Dhanda, a
&gt; lawmaker who represents the city of Gloucester in parliament.

&gt; Dozens of train journeys and flights were canceled Friday -- but
&gt; services were operating as normal on Saturday.

&gt; Darren Carr, among those stranded overnight in Gloucestershire, was
&gt; forced to abandon a train journey with his family. &quot;We are tired, fed
&gt; up and we don't know when we are going home,&quot; Carr said.

Some people are such whiners.

But I was under the impression that weather and weather events occurred
even before man started burning stuff.

And I'm still waiting for an explanation of how GW can cause stationary
highs and stationary lows.

Except of course that to get more water vapor into the atmosphere
takes more heat in the first place, the condensation takes place when
the humid air reaches the cooler altitudes!
The flooding in eastern England in the early 50's was due to storm
surge not rain.

">

With the higher flux of CR in the last decade, the chances of cloud
condensation has risen drastically.
Just make a thought experiment:
Take a sealable vessel, that is permeable for neutrons (CR) and fill it with
water vapor. Now, for simulating GW, heat this vessel and alwasy be sure
that the water vapor is at the same amount of saturation.
Then stop heating and seal the vessel.
When the vessel now starts to cool again, a single neutron penetration
would be enough to start a kind of chain reaction of cloud condensation
that you can see as droplets in the vessel. It &quot;reduces&quot; the over-saturation
of water vapor.

A possible explanation what could have happened is:
In the atmosphere, water vapor can reach higher layers above the
climate active layer of the troposhere, where it cooled and came down.
The problem was, that without CR the troposhere was slightly warmer and
the condensing water vapor droplets were soon be changed back to vapor,
as soon as they hit the troposhere from upside.
Since troposhere is cooling for a decade, this &quot;response&quot; is not more given
and cooled water vapor can reach lower troposphere layers, where it condensed
to low altitude rain clouds due to CR and aerosols.
The feedback is, that now, when we have cooler temperatures, the
evaporation of water vapour diminishes too, because cooler air can't hold
the same amout of water vapor, that warm air.
This feedback will continue until there is no more water vapor (like under
arctic conditions) or CR declining.

Remember the Maunder minimum, where almost no sun activity occured,
resulting in high CR flux and cooling down the earth to extreme cold.
This is, where we are now standing... at the edge of a new minimum.
It has already begun for one decade and, after prediction of solar cycle 25 as
the weakest of centuries, we will go on cooling, contrary to the IPCC projections
of a linear warming to 2100, that must come to their conclusions, because they
never enough mentioned solar activity and cosmic rays in their entirety.

No. We had that last year and for several years before - to the extent
that our water reservoirs were running dry. We had hosepipe bans
everywhere and some places were rationed on standpipes in the
street.

That was very unusual - almost as unusual as the current flooding.
These are new extremes.

Is there somewhere that has perfect weather, now or in the past 8000 years?

I've live around and every place I've been has it's little problems like
tornado's to hurricanes, to permafrost. Most people complain all the
time about the weather... it's hot it's cold, will this rain ever
stop.... Imagine an entire network called the weather channel? while
every other broadcaster and internet news site has weather reports also.

Maybe Xanax will help the weather?

Unlike computers, human memories are re-constructive.

I don't doubt that it was rainy, but the storm surge does
seem to have been problematic:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953

Presumably, North Sea storms are a colder climate phenomenon,
(they certainly were more frequent during the 1100s and 1200s)
one which would increase if we reversed this beneficial AGW:

&gt; No. We had that last year and for several years before - to the extent

&gt; everywhere and some places were rationed on standpipes in the
&gt; street.

&gt; That was very unusual - almost as unusual as the current flooding.
&gt; These are new extremes.

Personal experience says otherwise.  I was all over the Isles in the
summer of '76 and there was massive serious drought everywhere -
dangerous reservoir shortages, ground cracks you could climb into, and
people walking around without their brella's complaining about the
sun.  Back there in '79 and it was shoe-squish everywhere I went.

Now if wild parrots starting nesting successfully in the garden ...

&gt; &gt; Flooding Throughout Britain Traps Hundreds

&gt; &gt; Saturday,  July 21, 2007
&gt; &gt; Associated Press

&gt; &gt; LONDON -- Helicopter and boat crews rescued hundreds trapped Saturday
&gt; &gt; after storms whipped through Britain, flooding towns and villages,
&gt; &gt; including William Shakespeare's picturesque birthplace where waters
&gt; &gt; gushed into a theater.

&gt; &gt; Motorists slept overnight in cars on rain-lashed highways, while
&gt; &gt; others were attempting to find vehicles abandoned on major roads
&gt; &gt; Friday after the downpours caused long delays.

&gt; &gt; Meteorologists said many areas of Britain had more than a month's
&gt; &gt; worth of rain in a few hours Friday and predicted more downpours
&gt; &gt; across the weekend.

&gt; &gt; &quot;These are the sorts of rainfalls that we experienced in the past
&gt; &gt; every 100 years, every 150 years, sometimes every 200 years -- they're
&gt; &gt; very extreme, Baroness Barbara Young, chief executive of Britain's
&gt; &gt; Environment Agency, told Sky News.

&gt; &gt; Weather forecaster MeteoGroup UK, said that Pershore, a town around
&gt; &gt; 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of London, was worst hit,
&gt; &gt; drenched by 145.4 millimeters (5.72 inches) of rain in 25 hours,
&gt; &gt; between Thursday and Friday. Usual levels are 50-60 millimeters (2 to
&gt; &gt; 2.3 inches) in a month, the center said.

&gt; &gt; Waters rushed into the basement of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, in
&gt; &gt; Stratford-upon-Avon, around 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of
&gt; &gt; London.

&gt; &gt; The theater company, which has two other venues in the town and is
&gt; &gt; currently refurbishing the flooded venue, canceled a planned
&gt; &gt; performance of &quot;Macbeth&quot; on Saturday, fearing audiences wouldn't be
&gt; &gt; able to reach the site.

&gt; &gt; &quot;The area where the theaters are is under water,&quot; said spokesman Dean
&gt; &gt; Asker. &quot;It's a shame we're not performing &quot;The Tempest,&quot; it would've
&gt; &gt; been more appropriate.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Royal air force helicopters rescued more the 100 people from rooftops
&gt; &gt; of flooded villages and around 2,000 people spent Friday night in
&gt; &gt; emergency shelters in Gloucestershire, a county in southwest England.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I've never seen torrential rain like this, the weather has been
&gt; &gt; freakish across the whole of the country,&quot; said Parmjit Dhanda, a
&gt; &gt; lawmaker who represents the city of Gloucester in parliament.

&gt; &gt; Dozens of train journeys and flights were canceled Friday -- but
&gt; &gt; services were operating as normal on Saturday.

&gt; &gt; Darren Carr, among those stranded overnight in Gloucestershire, was
&gt; &gt; forced to abandon a train journey with his family. &quot;We are tired, fed
&gt; &gt; up and we don't know when we are going home,&quot; Carr said.

Interesting how 'six dead,  20,000 houses ruined in Yorkshire,  roads closed
