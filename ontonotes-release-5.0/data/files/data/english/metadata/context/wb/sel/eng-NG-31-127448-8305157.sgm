From the article:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Among all the letters I have received on my Darwin columns -- mostly
blind support, or blind abuse -- one struck me as especially worth
answering: &quot;Wake up, man. Whether or not 'Darwinism' is good science,
it is accepted as good science by most intelligent people, and if you
persist in attacking it you will lose the respect of people who are
prepared to listen to you on many other subjects. Why don't you have
the tactical sense to leave Darwinism alone?&quot;

The answer to this has been implicit in what I have written.
Nevertheless, it is worth spelling out. It is because Darwinism has
embedded itself so deeply into the assumptions of our age, that it
must be attacked frontally. For Darwinian assumptions cloud our view
of reality. They subvert our grasp of moral issues. They make it
possible for people to be dismissive, not only of art, philosophy and
religion, but of the requirements and limitations of true scientific
research. They eviscerate the human spirit, by insisting that, in the
last analysis, everything is random and meaningless. Conversely, they
justify true fascism (&quot;survival of the fittest&quot;), and all the horrors
of eugenics, abortions and euthanasia.

Moral relativism could not stand, except on a Darwinist base, and
reason itself is rendered defenceless, by the notion that all nature
was randomly contrived.

If this article is typical of his writings on evolutionary theory,
it's not clear to me that he deserves much beyond blind abuse;
certainly he does not offer serious scientific challenges to
evolutionary theory, or even an interesting and logically consistent
_argumentum ad consequentiam_.  Of course, if only &quot;most&quot; of his
respondents offer either blind support or abuse, presumably he's
encountered, and ignored, more substantial replies.

At the risk of riding my hobbyhorse one time too many into battle, is
there a creationist alive who notes the teensy-tiny contradiction
between &quot;Darwinism insists that everything is random and meaningless&quot;
and &quot;Darwinism justifies true fascism, etc.?&quot;  If everything is random
and meaningless, there are no justifications for anything.  If
everything is &quot;randomly contrived,&quot; then what is &quot;survival of the
fittest&quot; except an empty phrase without enough content to base a
political ideology on?  But then, it seems to me that there is at
least some tension between the author's assertion that Darwin (like
Marx and Freud) was a &quot;Victorian determinist,&quot; and his horror at the
&quot;randomness&quot; of evolutionary theory.

The author states that he has read Darwin.  Perhaps this is even true,
although nothing Darwin says seems to have much shaped his views of
Darwin's ideas.  Certainly he has not seemed to grasp another point:
that evolutionary theory is not religion, nor even an ideology like
Marxism, such that it depends on the authority and genius of its
original author, so that all issues in the field can be settled by an
appeal to the prophet and his writings.  He does not, at least in
this short column, show any interest in any evolutionary theorist
since Darwin.

I have this sneaking suspicion (perhaps entirely unjustified) that to
the author, the &quot;true limitations of scientific research&quot; are that
science cannot possibly discover anything he'd really rather not know,
nor can its results contradict anything he'd prefer to believe.

It seems to me that moral relativism could stand quite well on a
creationist base: assume (as ID permits) that the Creator simply
hasn't bothered to create an objective, absolute moral code and that
we're pretty much on our own trying to figure out right from wrong.
OTOH, the Panda's Thumb features an article by Hector Avalos arguing
that  creationism specifically implies moral relativism: &lt;http://
www.talkreason.org/articles/Genocide.cfm#christ &gt;.  Since evolutionary
theory does not, in fact, hold that &quot;all nature was randomly
contrived,&quot; but implies that our minds were shaped by the need to
actually represent nature in a consistently useful manner, ISTM that
David Warren is also wrong that &quot;reason itself is rendered
defenceless&quot; by &quot;Darwinism.&quot;

David Warren writes on Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday; other days, he
lapses into dull sanity.

Isn't that a parody of the &quot;outspoken atheism alienates religious
moderates&quot; view? If so, nicely done. Looks like Warren swallowed the
bait whole.

FROM A WORK IN PROGRESS:

... the failure of eugenics and Social Darwinism say nothing
about the technical validity of Darwin's core ideas.  After all,
those so inclined might make a moral case against physicists
for their development of nuclear weapons, that it was a
perversion of science as bad or worse than the Nazi Action
T4 program, and argue that nuclear weapons ought to be
banned -- but no sensible case can be made that the
physicists were wrong in any technical sense.  Like it or
not, the bombs worked as designed, and nobody could
convincingly argue that it was by accident, using
fundamentally flawed theory.

Darwinism has no technical demonstration of its validity
as vivid as that of a mushroom cloud, but the analogy
holds:  even if, in some alternate universe, Charles
Darwin had been actually a brutish thug, a Mr. Hyde
instead of a Dr. Jekyll, that says nothing about the
truth or falsity of Darwinism as a description of the
way the physical Universe works.  While Darwinism
has implications that definitely need to be discussed,
no ideological argument has any relevance to
whether Darwinism actually works or not, and credibly
claiming that Darwin's theory was technically wrong
demands  another approach.

Do these guys ever really know what &quot;Darwinism&quot; is.  They claim it has
moral failings, but it tends to be whatever their religion can't deal
with about science.  Maybe they should look into the moral failure of
a group of people that would rather blather on about Darwinism and run
dishonest political scams like intelligent design, instead of
admitting where their beliefs come up short and lying to themselves
about it.  I wonder if it ever occurs to them that they are claiming
the moral highground, but they have to lie to defend it.  Not only
that, but it is supposed to be in defense of their religious beliefs
and they even have to lie about that.  It would seem that they are
living in more like a pit than the moral highground.

As if creationists don't practice moral relativism.

Biologists don't say that biology is randomly contrived.

I rather suspect that it is some other view that rendered his reason
defenseless.
