The Israeli, Dubai, Chertoff Connection

Wayne Madsen - Wayne Madsen Report March 3, 2006

The Israeli, Dubai, Chertoff connection -- its just the tip of the
Russian-Israeli mafia and &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; iceberg. Michael Brown, the
former head of FEMA, deserves credit for blowing the whistle on the
&quot;agenda&quot; of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. For years, a
handful of prosecutors, FBI agents, and investigative journalists have
stressed the connections between Russian-Israeli mafia tycoons,
weapons and diamond smugglers, and terrorist networks associated with
&quot;Al Qaeda&quot; and affiliated organizations. Yet, it is the much-maligned
Brown, a one-time GOP operative and &quot;golden boy,&quot; who has taken the
initiative to call for Chertoff's firing and a complete overhaul of
the Homeland Security Department. Even in these strange times, this is
an amazing turn of events and begs the question of what Brown knows
about Chertoff and his connections to Dubai and covering up terrorist
investigations. Brown is in the unique position of being aware of
Dubai's major role in horse racing (and possibly money laundering) and
being briefed on various maritime and other terrorist threats as head
of FEMA. Which means that Brown may have enough information to be very
dangerous to the Bush crime family.

Chertoff is a long-time GOP political hack and neo-con operative. He
was the Special Counsel for the Senate &quot;Whitewater&quot; Committee from
1994 to 1996, a costly effort to create a political scandal for
President Clinton and Hillary Clinton where there was no scandal.
Hillary Clinton, to her credit, cast the lone vote against Chertoff's
confirmation as a federal judge in 2003. There is one thing that
Hillary Clinton and Michael Brown agree on -- they both despise
Chertoff. And with good reason.

Chertoff was the head of the Assistant Attorney General for the
Criminal Division of the Justice Department in the lead up to and
aftermath of the 911 attacks. It was Chertoff who ordered the FBI not
to pursue Mossad cells discovered to be operating alongside the
hijacker cells in northern New Jersey. With FBI and other field law
enforcement reports on suspicious Israeli office &quot;mover&quot; activity in
the New York-New Jersey area in the months prior to 911, Chertoff
failed to order an investigation of why Zim-American Israeli Shipping
Company suddenly terminated its lease of offices on the 16th and 17th
floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, forfeiting a
$50,000 deposit a week prior to 911 and moving its operations to
Norfolk. Zim's parent company, Zim Israel Navigation Co, is half owned
by the Israeli government. Norfolk's port operations are due to come
under Dubai Ports World ownership if the buy-out deal is approved.

Therefore, it is no surprise that Zim's chairman wrote to Senator
Clinton offering high praise for Dubai Ports World and revealed that
Zim and Dubai Ports are &quot;strong business partners.&quot; Zim's chairman
also revealed that Zim's ships use Dubai ports but under different
flags other than Israeli.

Chertoff also failed to investigate the presence on the 33rd floor of
the North Tower of the Trade Center of the Yemen Import Company, an
office that, like Zim Shipping, had been cleared of all its personnel
in the weeks prior to 911, leaving only an answering machine and fax
in place.

As Assistant US Attorney, Chertoff also declined to prosecute Dr.
Magdy Elamir, an Egyptian-born neurologist in Jersey City who was
implicated in an FBI/ATF arms trafficking investigation code named
Operation Diamondback. It turned out that Elamir was a Chertoff's
client in a fraud case brought against Elamir's HMO by the state of
New Jersey. NBC's Dateline, on August 2, 2002, referred to a 1998
foreign intelligence report obtained by the network, &quot;The report
alleges that an H.M.O. owned by Dr. Elamir in New Jersey was 'funded
by ben [sic] Laden' and that in turn Dr. Elamir was skimming money
from the H.M.O. to fund 'terrorist activities.'&quot; New Jersey
investigators discovered that $15 million in funds from Elamir's HMO
were unaccounted for and Dateline determined that some of the funds
were transferred to off-shore bank accounts. Chertoff represented
Elamir at the time the money was shifted to the off-shore bank
accounts.

The weapons smugglers targeted by Diamondback also included those who
were smuggling nuclear components to the A Q Khan network. It was this
network that was a prime focus of Valerie Plame Wilson and her
Brewster Jennings and Associates covert CIA operatives. On January 14,
2005, Dateline's Chris Hansen interviewed ATF agent Dick Stoltz, the
supervisor of Diamondback:

&quot;In the summer of 1999, a group of illegal weapons dealers were
meeting at a warehouse in Florida, their conversations recorded by
federal investigators. One of the men, from Pakistan, was seeking
technology for nuclear weapons. Who did he say he was working for?

Dick Stoltz: &quot;Dr. Abdul Khan.&quot;

Chris Hansen: &quot;A.Q. Khan.&quot;

Dick Stoltz: &quot;A.Q. Khan.&quot;

Former federal undercover agent Dick Stoltz was posing as a black
market arms dealer.

Hansen: &quot;Did you realize what you had at the time?&quot;

Stoltz: &quot;No. We didn't.&quot;

But now he does -- because A.Q. Khan is considered, by some, to be the
most dangerous man in the world. Why? Because Dr. Khan has peddled
nuclear weapons technology to some of the countries the United States
considers most dangerous, and some accepted his offers.&quot;

&quot;Undercover federal agent Dick Stoltz says there's evidence Khan's
operatives were at work here in the U.S., like a man who asked if
Stoltz could supply heavy water, an ingredient used to make plutonium
for nuclear bombs. Stoltz: &quot;He said that Dr. Khan was handling the
negotiations behind the scene, as far as -- the heavy water.&quot;

Chertoff, in a major conflict-of-interest, abused his authority to
cover up the involvement of his client in the Diamondback probe.

Other than the Homeland Security Secretary's complete incompetence
during Hurricane Katrina, why would someone like Michael Brown have
special animosity towards Chertoff? Perhaps Brown's past job as
Commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association (IAHA) had
something to do with his sudden call for Chertoff's firing in the wake
of the Homeland Security chief's approval of the Dubai Ports World
deal to take over operations at 21 U.S. ports. Close Bush family
friend, the Emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, is
an avid horse racing fan and owner (as was the Emir's late father).
Dubai is the venue for an annual thoroughbred racing event where
millions of dollars change hands in betting. Horse betting in Dubai is
believed by law enforcement officials to be a major conduit for money
laundering in the region -- something that must have been known to
Brown as the oversight authority for the IAHA. In what could be the
most dramatic outcome of the Bush criminal scandal, Brown's experience
with the IAHA may prove embarrassing to Chertoff and the Bush criminal
cartel as Dubai comes under sharper focus.

Dubai is also an important diamond center. And that brings us into
Osama bin Laden's connections to the Israeli diamond trade. The
following was sent to WMR by a journalist source who was in Peshawar,
Pakistan in the weeks following U.S. intervention in Afghanistan. The
information comes from a Taliban member who escaped into Pakistan:

&quot;Osama left Afghanistan in a party of 26 people, mostly his family
members, on November 4 [2001]. He left from the &quot;south.&quot; [possibly
southern Iran].

&quot;This may surprise you, but you must understand the nature of
business. A business partnership is based on years of trust, and it is
totally separate from political or national loyalties.&quot;

&quot;Osama, when he realized that he was trapped between the Northern
Front and the US forces, called on an old business partner, who flew
in his jetliner, and ferried Osama to Africa.&quot;

&quot;Osama was a rich man, a millionaire, but spend a lot on the Afghan
war and reconstruction. While he was in Africa in exile, the Israelis
approached him to take over the diamond business from the Lebanese in
West Africa. (background: Muslims provide the strong arm for the raw
diamond trade in West Africa, and it required a respected and tough
Muslim like Osama to wrestle the trade away from the Shi'ites from
southern Lebanon. The Israelis could not stand the thought of their
Antwerp diamond industry financing suicide bombers in south
Lebanon).&quot;

&quot;With the diamond trade under his control, Osama became a billionaire
(repeat), a billionaire . . . The diamonds were sent to the Russian
mafiyah, who then sold to Antwerp.&quot;

(Antwerp, btw, was where the shoe bomber and countless other
&quot;terrorists&quot; were financed and where AQ [Khan] money was being wired
to New York via Hassidim diamond merchants.)

For building materials and equipment, Bin Laden's construction family
routinely dealt with Jewish businessmen through Yemen. Since Saudis
could have no direct dealings, the Bin Ladens used Yemenis, who lived
alongside Jews in their Yemeni homeland. This is how Osama's father
became so big.

&quot;Inside Afghanistan, the Taliban were not anti-Jewish because the
Pashtun tribe are one of the &quot;lost tribes of Israel&quot;. Our customs and
names are identical to those of the Jews. So there was no problem in
fighting the Soviet occupation and then Shiite enemy, and Osama led
this fight.&quot;

In fact, this communique from Peshawar is born out by the story of
Ambuy Gem Corporation president Yehuda Abraham, who was arrested at
his New York &quot;Diamond District&quot; office in 2003 for his involvement in
a Russian shoulder mounted missile launcher smuggling ring involving a
British national with ties to the Viktor Bout smuggling ring, Hemant
Lakhani, and a Malaysian national believed to have ties to Jemaah
Islamiya, the Al Qaeda affiliate in southeast Asia. Bout's smuggling
network was partly based in Dubai. Abraham, a Bukharan Jewish native
of Afghanistan who spoke Pashto and Urdu. An well-placed Israeli
source told WMR that Afghan-born Jews are so rare, Abraham would &quot;have
most certainly been used as an agent by Mossad.&quot;

But Abraham, like Zim Shipping, had special dispensation under the
Arab boycott of Israel. A U.S.-Israeli dual national, Abraham
maintained a diamond store in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. His primary clientele: the Saudi royal family.
It was also discovered that Abraham was operating a &quot;hawalah&quot; -- an
Islamic money transfer network -- from his diamond business. It was
that hawalah that was used to transfer money from the weapons sales
out of the United States. Moreover, Osama bin Laden's diamond courier
who fenced West African diamonds into the Hassidim-run Hatton Garden,
London diamond district went by the very non-Muslim-sounding name of
&quot;Cyril Jacob.&quot; A former Mossad chief told this editor in 2002 that if
one wanted to find the source for most of Al Qaeda's funding, you
didn't need to look any further than West Africa's diamond trade and
&quot;the six biggest U.S. banks in New York.&quot;

In addition, Osama Bin Laden is reported to own a fleet of merchant
ships, something that makes the Dubai Ports World deal and Chertoff's
endorsement of it even more suspect. Some of these ships reportedly
are registered to China White Lines and involve Sicilian mafia
business fronts.

In April 1993, Rashid bin Maktoum, the then-Crown Prince of Dubai
opened a jewelry equipment manufacturers trade show in the emirate--
the show highlighted the equipment needed for stone cutting and other
jewelry-making processes. Soon, Dubai rivaled Antwerp and Tel Aviv as
a major diamond processing center -- a business in which Bin Laden is
now heavily invested.

Dubai Ports World and Zim Shipping, Michael Chertoff and Osama
financiers and A Q Khan smugglers, New York and London Hassidim
diamond dealers and Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist organizations
are connecting more dots.
