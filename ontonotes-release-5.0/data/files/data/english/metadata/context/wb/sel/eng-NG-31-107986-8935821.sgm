oops - too much water in the primary

I'm not all that concerned with this...  but I started thinking about
it and was wondering how one would go about fixing.  I brewed an amber
tonight, and with all the foam I had going (from aerating) when I
filled the primary, I miscalculated and added too much water...  about
1/3 to 1/2 gallon (5 gallon batch).  My SG came in low at 1.053...  I
was expecting 1.060 - 1.065.

Is there a fix here if I was so inclined?

Yes there is always a fix for those who need a fix. ;)
You can fortify it.  If you have 5 gallons after primary
fermentation is complete and if my calculations are correct,
then adding
5 fl oz of 190 proof Everclear = ~1.060
9 fl oz of 190 proof Everclear = ~1.065
11 fl oz of 100 proof whiskey   = ~1.061
18 fl oz of 100 proof whiskey   = ~1.065.

If I was fortifying an amber ale, my choice would be
Southern Comfort and I would call it Janis Joplin Ale.

Yeah, that's the cheatin' way to do it...... if you don't want to really
cheat too bad, you could boil up a little (I don't know how much, maybe half
a pound?) light malt extract in a little water (perhaps a cup of water), let
it cool, and then put that in to ferment.  It should raise your gravity up
to where it should have been.  Or, if you didn't pitch the yeast yet, you
could also boil it for a while to get rid of the extra water.  Either way.

If you boil the batch more, you'll end up with something more bitter
than you expected.

I'd just let it go and have a slightly lighter beer than you wanted.

weird, I responded to this earlier...  sorry if it shows up twice.

I figured it would turn out fine if I left it alone, but I set out to
brew a hefty amber...  so I decided to boil 1 1/2 lbs of malt extract
and a pound of brown sugar with 1 1/2 gallons of water to add to the
mix.  I'm not sure how many gravity points that'll give me, but it
should be interesting :)

By my figures it might even lower your gravity further.

1.053 x 5 gallons = 265 points
1.5 lbs extract  36 x 1.5 = 54 points
.5 lbs sugar 42 x .5 = 21points
1.5 gallons added water
265 + 54 + 21 = 340 points
340 divide by 6.5 gals = 52.3 or 1.052

I added a pound of brown sugar, plus after boiling, it was closer to a
gallon I think.  Regardless, I didn't add as much as I thought!  Where
do you get the point values?

Thanks,
JM

I did the same thing recently; my advice: don't mess with it.   My
beer (which was an american ale) ended up a bit lighter in both color
and flavor than it normally is, but you know what? It sure is a nice
refreshing summer session beer.  I'm especially enjoying it now with
temps at 104F here in Livermore.
