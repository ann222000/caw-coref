A Tanzim member who was arrested by IDF forces operating near Nablus for his
involvement in terror-related activities was identified as Fares Abu Ghanim,
the military said.

Abu Ghanim was among a group of wanted terror suspects who recently pledged
to stop their terror activity as part of the amnesty deal between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority.
