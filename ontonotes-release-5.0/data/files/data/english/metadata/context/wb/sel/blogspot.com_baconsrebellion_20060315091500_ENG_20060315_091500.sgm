Some of Virginia's biggest snows come in March. Here is a snow job on
Transportation. I got a copy of this ‘Dear Friends’ constituent letter
from Sen. Marty Williams (R-NN) from fellow constituents. Marty didn’t
send me a copy even though he is my State Senator and I’m an elected
Republican Party in his district (1-SD). I edited his letter to help him
out anyway and, lo and behold, his letter shows up in the Daily Press as
an op ed. The Daily Press doesn’t mention that it’s a constituent
letter.

(Sen. Williams) March 10, 2006

Dear Friends: I wanted to let you know more about the transportation
situation in the Commonwealth and specifically how it affects the
residences of Newport News, Hampton, York County and Poquoson. I would
also like to take this opportunity to describe why I feel this is a
watershed year for transportation in Hampton Roads. December 2006 is a
make or break time in Hampton Roads. Before year-end, the Hampton Roads
Planning District must submit an updated long-range regional
transportation plan. Unless this package includes actual and realistic
ways of financing the third crossing, improving U.S. 460 and
constructing a second midtown tunnel, the region will lose the federal
funding currently in place for these projects. We will also lose $14.6
million dollars in environmental impact studies that will expire and $63
million in current federal earmarks.

(JAB) · What has prevented the HRPD from submitting a plan to date?
If the HRPD can’t figure out priorities and come up with a funding plan,
then they should all resign. In your Yes! Campaign analysis from 02 (the
Great Transportation Tax Scam), it was clear that tolls would pay for
most of the Third Crossing. What have you and the HRPD been doing in the
past 4 years, besides raising our taxes and trying to raise them more?

· What are the priorities for Tidewater – number them one to n? What
is the minimum funding stream each one needs for the next 20 years to
keep from losing the sunk costs?

· $14.6m + $63m = $77.6m is a whole lot less than the $2.5 billion
plus you want to stick to the Virginia taxpayers. Better to lose the
millions than bleed the billions – if the HRPD is so incompetent to
force that.

(Sen. Williams) Additionally, without congestion relief, the region
will fail to meet federal air quality standards. This means that in
addition to the standard yearly safety inspection: 1. All vehicles will
be required to have a separate inspection for emissions. The charge for
the inspection is $28.00. The failure rate is over 50%, and that rate
increases with the age of the car. The average repair bill to bring your
automobile into compliance is between $450.00 and $850.00. 2. These
inspections will also require that you take additional days off from
work or Saturday afternoons away from your family. 3. When we fail to
meet federal air quality standards, the penalty is forfeiture of all
federal highway dollars to the region. 4. We will then be asking our
constituents to pay federal gas taxes and shipping that money off to
other regions.

(JAB) · Get serious. Your Yes! Campaign used this same scare tactic
in 02. It didn’t work then. What makes you think it will work now?

· Nothing in yours/HRPDs plan reduces congestion. The 02 plan ended
up with more congested miles in 20 years than we have now. Building
roads doesn’t decrease the miles driven.

· Nothing in your plan actually reduces the miles driven or cars on
the road – to reduce pollution. · What per cent of the pollution problem
comes from vehicles?

(Sen Williams) These grave conditions are irrefutable. We have
letters from the Federal Highway Administration detailing its position
on this issue very clearly.

(JAB) · Put the letters on the web.

(Sen Williams) There are very real, very negative consequences for
the region. Surely neither you nor I want these things to happen. The
solutions that I am supporting have the potential to cost less for the
average citizen than the cost you may bare [(JAB) bear] if we do
nothing. The actual cost is easy to calculate, but sitting in traffic,
consuming fuel and time is somewhat harder to identify. But we know it
when we see it. Only an increased dedicated funding source will prevent
this from happening. That is why I have offered solutions to our dilemma
and I am perfectly willing to compromise with others if they offer real
solutions - not temporary band-aids.

(JAB)· Raising taxes isn’t a real solution. Raising taxes kills jobs.
The plan you support ( http://www.thomasjeffersoninst.org/main/main.php
Click on 'to see a powerpoint summary of each of the proposed tax and
transportation plans') shows on slide 12 – your plan adds 8405
government jobs in year one and KILLS 5805 private sector jobs in year
one. Then, magically in this analysis, it gets better in 4 years. Taxes
are called killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

(Sen Williams) I have received encouragement from some of my
constituents to support the House plan. I should not do that when I
know, for a fact that the House plan does not move Hampton Roads 1 step
toward avoiding these grave consequences. The House plan issues over
$8oo million in new debt to free up money for Transportation. If we
endorse borrowing money when times are this good, what in the world will
we do when we arrive at an inevitable recession?

(JAB) · You supported the billions in huge bond issues on the ballot
for education and the environment. What is different that made that debt
good and this debt bad?

· When revenues decrease in the inevitable recession you cut
spending. See, the government gets its money from the People. When they
suffer during a recession the Government gets less money. There is only
one economy to take money from.

· If you think the current level of spending is untenable in the
future, then cut back now.

(Sen Williams) The issue of slowing traffic to collect a toll is also
a real concern for many of you. Let me assure you that I would never
support erecting barriers to traffic in our major thoroughfares. Tolling
today is not a traditional toll both. Technology is in place today that
identifies by electronic signal and photographs all vehicles using the
facilities. And Yes! we have the ability to bill all users including out
of state travelers for the toll fee. There will also be a system in
place to recognize commuters and bill them at a much lower rate. These
concepts are real and being used all over the world right now.

(JAB) · Tolls make sense. Agreed.

· There are other things like private-partnerships, tax exemptions
for telecommuting, mass transit, etc. not including in the Senate
‘plan’. · Fix VDOT. Read the House plan to see how to do it. How much
was the overrun for the interchange on I-64 you sponsored? How long was
the overrun? What was the cost in wasted time, accidents for that
interchange to profit the Hampton City ‘Power Plant’ boondoggle?

(Sen Williams) My job as a legislator is to try and offer solutions.
So far the best and only true solution to this problem is the plan put
forward by the Senate of Virginia. Again I stand ready to compromise
with anyone offering a real solution for my constituents. The Senate
plan does not raid funds from sources traditionally spent on education,
law enforcement and health care and shift them to road building. This
reduces the chance that transportation funding will be forced to compete
with other core services—a situation where transportation always loses.

(JAB) · This is just false. The House budget (with no tax increase)
has a $2.4b in additional spending for education. The House spending for
the environment is the same as the Senate’s. The House budget increases
spending on Public Safety $446m. Quit crying “Wolf!” about phony
spending cuts. Democrats do that.

· Again, the money for all reasons comes from the same source – the
taxpayers. All money competes with all money for the budget – unless
legislators are incapable of setting priorities – like every family and
business in the Commonwealth do when – especially when you raise our
taxes.

· Why did you vote for those budgets that raided the Transportation
Trust Fund? You moved the money meant for transportation to other
purposes. Take responsibility for your actions.

(Sen Williams) This is a prudent, responsible pay-as-you-go approach.
The plan does not rely on debt. This keeps transportation from further
driving the Commonwealth’s spending for debt service (one of the fastest
growing parts of the budget) and avoids Washington D.C. type deficit
spending that the House plan embraces.

(JAB) · This is a tax-as-you-go. You were elected in 95. Republicans
won the majority in the GA in 97. What have you been doing other than
trying to raise our taxes (02), raising our taxes (04), and planning to
raise our taxes (06)? This is Washington tax and spend – Virginia can’t
do deficit spending – read our Constitution.

· You and other Republicans raided the Transportation Trust Fund.

· You and other Republicans have failed to offer anything in 9 years.

· Didn’t you just pull back your own bill to have tolls across the
James River to pay for most of the Third Crossing?

· Where is the plan for that crossing? Why hasn’t the HRPD made a
decision for so many years?

(Sen. Williams) I know this debate will continue over the next few
weeks and compromise positions may appear that will more fully embrace
your particular position on this issue. I also am not naive enough to
think my solution is the only one. If someone can show me a plan that
solves this enormous problem without revenue enhancements you can bet I
will be more than supportive. So far no plans that even begin to move
Hampton Roads forward without new revenue have been disclosed. I am
ready to negotiate those compromises. It is my job to work diligently to
find solutions for the real problems that confront my constituents. If
you have any thoughts on this subject please contact me at (757)
599-8683.

(JAB) · It is wrong to raise our taxes because you failed for 9 years
to establish priorities, fund them properly and come up with plans that
actually work to reduce congestion and pollution.

Sincerely, Senator Marty Williams

And very sincerely, James Atticus Bowden

"The 02 plan ended up with more congested miles in 20 years than we
have now. Building roads doesn’t decrease the miles driven."

That doesn't strike me as a good argument. We are not buying or
building roads to create (or necessarily to reduce) congested miles but
to provide throughput that has economic value. Whether one plan is
better than another depends on how much total throughput, how much cost
per throughput, and how much inferior product (congestion) per
throughput.

"Nothing in your plan actually reduces the miles driven or cars on
the road – to reduce pollution."

Reducing miles driven may not reduce pollution, if the plan is one
that creates more congestion. Reducing the number of cars on the road
will definitely reduce pollution from cars, but it may not reduce
pollution overall.

"What per cent of the pollution problem comes from vehicles? "

“Point sources”—especially the electricity-generating plants in the
area that burn coal, oil, or natural gas—account for 30 percent of the
nitrogen oxides and 4 percent of the VOCs.

• “Area sources”—including gasoline stations, oil spills, residential
furnaces, bakeries, dry cleaners, consumer products, lawn mowers, leaf
blowers, and backyard grills—contribute 9 percent of the nitrogen oxides
and 43 percent of the VOCs.

• Off-road vehicles—from bulldozers and other heavy construction
equipment to the mobile lounges at Dulles Airport—account for 14 percent
of the nitrogen oxides and 20 percent of the VOCs.

• The thousands of cars, trucks, and buses that have made Washington
the second most congested metropolitan area in the country contribute
the rest—47 percent of nitrogen oxides and 33 percent of VOCs.

One of the more surprising aspects of air pollution is the impact of
small gasoline engines, especially lawn mowers. Running a lawn mower for
30 minutes is worse than driving an average car 200 miles

A $9-billion investment in the 103-mile Metrorail system [which]
registers 625,000 trips each weekday.... But Metro’s route system, based
on commuting patterns in and out of DC that were more common in the
1950s, does not match the circular flow of travel inspired now by
suburban office parks." Washingtonian

"Raising taxes kills jobs."

OK, so does inadequate infrastructure, where is the tradeoff.

"It is wrong to raise our taxes because you failed for 9 years to
establish priorities, fund them properly and come up with plans that
actually work to reduce congestion and pollution."

In the face of increasing population and economy what makes you think
there is any plan that will reduce congestion and pollution without
killing jobs or inducing a recession? It seems to me that you are
setting a standard that is frankly impossible.

Dear JAB,

You need to be more sincere in argumentation before you sign off
"very sincerely". You state correctly that taxes can kill the goose that
lays the golden egg. They can. But how do you "know" that? Either you
"know" this or you are just "hyping" your side of the story here.
Knowledge comes from careful study and the STAMP model and its results
appear to be just such a careful study.

That study correctly shows the economic intuition we all know. As
taxes go up to fund needed infrastructure, private sector jobs may be
shed in the initial years. But then you leave your books and wave your
hands and apparently lose your mind.

The study then shows how the highly productive "investment" in
infrastructure pays great dividends in the next years. 16,000 total new
jobs are created and you dismiss this as "magic". It is not magic. It is
economics and capitalism at work as modelled through a computable
general equilibrium.

This model was built by conservatives with a Reagon free market
mindset. Taxes have consequences. But in this experiment, the investment
in infrastructure has far different effects from taxes simply dumped
into the general fund. Taxes used for high rate of return projects yield
high rates of return.

You can wave your hands all you want and chant medieval slogans about
magic, but the only magic here is the magic of the market.

Ray: Thanks for the great facts on pollution. Glad for data. The
problem with congestion is that Marty Williams is trying to say the
taxes will reduce pollution to pass the EPA regional standards. They
won't. The tax,spend and pour concrete folks have argued that they will
reduce congestion. Maybe you don't, but they do.

I've never seen a stat on how many jobs are lost because of x minutes
delay in traffic. The tolerance (demand curve for jobs) seems pretty
steep in NoVa.

There are workable plans that don't require tax hikes (tolls but no
other new taxes). In Hampton Roads you could build the train and truck
connection from the Port to 460 to go up the Southside and not dump
traffic on I64. That would help with congestion. You can add tunnels
across the Hampton Roads crossing. That helps.

You can see if you can do a private public partnership for expansion
of 1-64 up The Peninsula.

You can provide corporate tax credits for telecommuting. Etc.

Anon: I know from my graduate studies in Economics that $150m in
taxes kills 5000 jobs - at least.

The STAMP model is bogus if it imputes private sector job growth in 4
years - when not one mile of road has been built - as taxes are sucking
more money out of the economy. Something is wrong there.

The general rule is a tax dollar puts 23 cents in the economy - tops
(More Grad School econ, not medieval chanting). If you think road
building is an outlier that produces more - I'd like to see the number
and the study. It sure won't produce it in 4 years. 10,302 of the jobs
(from the 16k) you cite are GOVERNMENT jobs. Not a Republican, free
market thing to do.

Look at the House plan if believe in the magic of the market. Job
growth every year.

Anon seeks knowledge: How do you know from your graduate studies in
Economics "that $150m in taxes kills 5000 jobs - at least?" Who says so
and where? What type of taxes and what was the revenue used for? I'll it
was not on infrastructure or you would not have that result. More below.

You assert without any evidence,"The STAMP model is bogus if it
imputes private sector job growth in 4 years." They have a general
equilibrium model and you have assertion here. In science, they win. In
assertion, you're ahead.

You assert: "If you think road building is an outlier that produces
more - I'd like to see the number and the study." In fact, it is not an
outlier. It is a common elasticity that can be found in the
transportation literature. I'm sure they have it embedded in their
model. You assert that it must be bogus out of hand.

Do you see a pattern here? You are the one making assertions without
evidence and you may be the one that needs to find those numbers before
lobbing bombs. I think you will find that their model is pretty decent
if you would care to look.

Anon: I don't remember the source for the factoid on taxes and jobs.
You can look it up. Herman K. Bator was the professor for
Macro-economics. If one looks at the taxes - as many things are - as a
normal distribution of different taxes, then the distinctions you make
are moot. The fact is that in a general model (the Bator Bedsheet Model
for GDP) the taking of taxes reduces capital. Capital grows capital.
Government uses capital inefficiently and the return is poor. Ask the
PhDs in econ - Jim Miller, Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, etc. Are you
denying that taxes kill jobs and that the sun rises in the East?

I looked the STAMP model and posted about it. They say there is 10k
government job growth (makes sense for a tax and spend program) and
about 6k private sector growth -which seems screwy. Which is why I
suggested a PhD economist from Heritage Foundation - who run Macro
models - look at it in more detail. The deletrious effects (loss of
jobs) of over $1b being sucked out of the economy every year for 4 years
far outweigh the return in government contracting that might boost
private employment. And since NO roads will be built in that time frame
- then there can't be any economic effect creating jobs from the roads.

Assertions without evidence? Lobbing bombs? No, just stating economic
facts.

What is the margin of error for a klugged together model from
different states using pre-04 tax data from Virginia?

JAB: I mostly, but not entirely agree with you. I think we don't know
anywhere near enough to make real arguments based on facts, so we are
reduced to making political arguments.

Political arguments, in turn, are based on our individual, life-long,
collections of anecdotal evidence, aphorisms, parental teaching, and
experience. If we are lucky there will be some actual knowlege and
observation thrown in as well.

Anecdotally, there is plenty of evidence that people in DC and NOVA
are throwing in the towel, but we don't know what the job elasticity is.
There are recent entries in several blogs discussing when it is time to
get out, and a letter to the editor in a recent Post.

I'm skeptical of the STAMP model, and also of the MWCUG
transportation model, precisely because they have political origins.
These black boxes are going to need years of validation, and a lot more
understanding before they are accepted. When Lotus 123 first came out, I
had a boss who would work up a financial sheet on his calculator, and
ask me to put in 123. After I did that, he would frequently tell me it
was wrong, only to find out that the sheet was right and he had made a
mistake in his calulations. For months, I would take him stuff, and he
would cross check it on his calculator. By the time ayear had passed,
his calculator was retired.

As a society, we are going to have to go through something similar,
before we can trust our knowlege over our dogma.

Anybody know what a Kluge is?

Kluge was a german manufacturer of printing presses. They were
characterized by an amazing assortment of cams and bell cranks and
suction tubes that inked the type, handled the paper, and actuated the
press. If you ever saw one operate, they were mesmerizing in their
complexity.

They were also highly accurate. You could set it up to print a single
postage stamp at a time. Just because it is a Kluge, doesn't mean it
isn't good.

Ray: I agree except that economic laws, like physical laws, aren't up
for discussion unless one wants to challenge rational empiricism - and
some Liberals, like their Marxists cousins - do.

Thanks for the info on the Kluge. That was great. It has the
connotation of disparate things forced to work together - perhaps well
or perhaps not.

I'm not sure I follow you on rational empiricism.

By economic laws, I think you mean things like supply and demand,
taxes kill jobs, net economic benefit, etc.

We can argue there are increasing costs associated with an
increasingly dirty environment, and there are increasing costs with
making it increasingly clean. Where the lines cross is the best economic
benefit.

Thats an economic law, as I see it.

But now if one person argues we should spend money to reduce one
pollutant and somebody else would rather spend the same money to reduce
their farvorite pollutant, then how do we know how best to spend the
available money, and still get the best economic benefit?

Isn't that where we cross over from economic laws to rational
empiricism. Doesn't RE boil down to what works best, given what we've
got?

We agree on econ laws.

By rational empiricism I am talking about how we expand the fields of
knowledge - not politics or pride or prejudices.

I taught research and methodology for the social sciences years ago.
When I speak of RE I'm talking about how we begin from an empirical -
testable - basis of agreement and build on it with rational inquiry -
again testable study. It's how we expand the basis of knowledge in all
fields.

Rational empiricism is how we know what we know.

That is what I thought you were saying.

I agree. We should put our theories to the test before we launch off
on some unproven, and expensive, theories about what should be done.

I've been holding forth here on the idea that we ought to look at
what is really happening, and make plans accordingly. Rational
Empiricism, if you will.

If we make plans according to what some would like to happen, as
opposed to what is happening, then we are more likely to fail.

Today in the Post we learn that the exurbs are growing faster than
ever, while at the same time planners are set on approving the Metro
West project in order to increase density there, in spite of opposition.
DC is losing population, and the inner suburbs are not growing as fast
as previously. DC is now considering eminent domain to follow through on
its plan to increase density in improve the neighborhood, in spite of
local opposition.

What would Rational Empiricism say?

Is anybody listening?

You are real adept at whining and complaining but fall far short on
anything constructive. If this is what Blogging is then I want little to
do with it. It appears, though you are not at all clear on what you
actually support, that you think the House Plan is the best option but I
wonder if you really have a grasp on all the plan entails. I don't want
more taxes, nor do I support the Senate Plan, but I do not want the
added debt and inadequate funding the House proposes. Much easier to sit
on the sidelines like an armchair quarter back and throw out criticism
than to actually propose real solutions. I won't visit this site again.
I think being a conservative republican means more than complaining and
requires effort towards real solutions. Reading your comments was a
total waste of brain power.
