You know how expensive the regular plastic retailers are .  Minimum 1
square foot charges on the 4&quot; x 5&quot; piece you need can make a small
piece really expensive.

I've got a solution for that.

I have a store on ebay where we sell offcuts of delrin, UHMW, teflon,
Nylon 101, Nylatron and Nylatron GSM.

URL is:

http://stores.ebay.ca/The-Great-Industrial-Garage-Sale_W0QQssPageName...

Have a look - see if there's anything that fits your needs.

We combine shipping and offer discounts for multiple-piece buys.

Well, there has been extensive discussion among the sellers about all
the changes being made at ebay as well.  I would say that the general
feeling is that the sellers don't see where all of these changes are
leading to, and they're getting a little shell-shocked at finding
something different every few days.  Sort of a &quot;stop the world, I want
to get off!&quot; mentality.

But the long and the short of it is that ebay is still the biggest
game in town.  The alternate sites really aren't all that busy, so
what's a seller to do?

If any of you want the items and have a real problem about dealing
with ebay, just email me and we can deal direct as well.

Yeah, their graphics can be a pain in the butt.  I don't think there's
anyway around most of it, but I've posted a question on the main
seller's boards.  Maybe someone has a trick I haven't heard of yet.

Well, if you've got someone that will still sell you offcuts, you're a
lucky man.  I've been getting reports from all over that the industry
is switching to the minimum square foot charge system.  I even had a
report from Melbourne, Australia to that effect.

Well I DID find a way to disable most of the graphics on the ebay
site!

If you're using Firefox as a browser, go to &quot;tools&quot;, select &quot;Options&quot;
and then unselect the box that says &quot;load Images automatically&quot;.

This makes the site a LOT faster - I have DSL lite and I could see the
difference.  The links remain, the search and clickable links still
work, you just don't see the graphics (and pictures).

Something to try.

That's my plastics dealer. I tell him what I want and he either says &quot;Look
here&quot; and I search or he pulls out a bar that has been cut and I buy the
full length knowing that I'll need the rest sooner or later and knowing
that he's giving me a reduction because he doesn't have to cut it and
getting rid of that cutoff collecting dust.
Sometimes it ends in an &quot;You get that for free&quot; and I give him a fiver for
their coffee-can.

Well, for all of the OTHER folks who go to their local plastics
retailler for a 1 x 4&quot; x 5&quot; piece of black delrin and come out
muttering, &quot;He wants $115 for that?  Is he crazy?&quot;, we aren't going to

If you are using Foxfire there are several add-ons you can
download that will help greatly.

Primary one is flashblock 1.5.4.1 that stops flash animations
from loading and running automatically.  You will get a place
holder and an option button.

also helpful for the &quot;arty&quot; pages is Read Easily 1.0.3 that
strips most formatting, ornate fonts, etc..

Content Preferences 0.3.1 can also remove much clutter.

Another other add-in of interest is DOM Inspector 1.8.1.7

FWIW -- I have determined that Microsoft Live messenger will work
with voice only over a 28.8 or better connection.  I have used
this extensively with a colleague in Brazil [he has DSL], and it
works fine.  Free download, and the whiteboard is also very
helpful.  Earphone/boom mike combo very helpful.  If your PC has
only one speaker out, get a y connector.

The problem in the US is not the availability of the base
material.  For example Enco sells small pieces of delrin, nylon,
etc. at semi-reasonable prices.

http://www.use-enco.com/CGI/INSRIT?PMAKA=510-1722&amp;PMPXNO;=8914298&amp;PART...;

The problem is getting specific grades of material, such as
Nylatron or Nylon GSM for a specific purpose such as making a
gear or a bearing/bushing.  Drops or small pieces of fiber
reinforced phenolic such as formica and mircarta are almost
impossible for the home shop or hobby machinist to find.  Where a
special steel is required, such as for a M-16 bolt, if you don't
want to use a stock material like S-7 drill rod you are out of
luck and even if you can use S-7, you have to buy an entire 3
foot piece.
click on
http://www.use-enco.com/CGI/INSRIT?PMAKA=505-0265&amp;PMPXNO;=953265&amp;PARTP...;

Forget about the super steels such as the HY series unless you
have a friend in the business.

Two suggestions for eric h &lt;ericchaged ... @gmail.com&gt; [the
original poster]

(1) put links on your page to a materials specification source,
with the disclaimer that your material is not certified, but will
be similar.
for some examples click on
http://www.portplastics.com/plastics/bearingAndWear/NylatronNSMNylonQ...

http://www.sdp-si.com/D190/HTML/D190T134.htm

(2) Partner with an American company that ships to Canada for a
break-bulk operation on both sides of the border.  Collect your
orders for a week, and then ship in bulk at low [salvage]
valuation to your partner.  The partner can then break-bulk and
ship individually, avoiding the exorbitant customs/cross-border
charges by UPS.  Indeed, it becomes practical to make a once
weekly trip into the US with a U-haul trailer, hauling the
US-&gt;Canada bulk shipments back, again with salvage/used
valuation.

Those are some pretty good ideas.  There are existing situations on
ebay which may prevent the once-a-week shipping idea, but I have been
looking at a consolidated run from my city to the border.

Most of the Delrin materials we get in are quadrant, BTW.  I've seen
very little in the way of other makes.

UHMW is more variable - some quadrant, lots of other makers.

I will check out your links.

&gt; Nick -

&gt; The problem in the US is not the availability of the base
&gt; material.  For example Enco sells small pieces of delrin, nylon,
&gt; etc. at semi-reasonable prices.

&gt; The problem is getting specific grades of material, such as
&gt; Nylatron or Nylon GSM for a specific purpose such as making a
&gt; gear or a bearing/bushing.  Drops or small pieces of fiber
&gt; reinforced phenolic such as formica and mircarta are almost
&gt; impossible for the home shop or hobby machinist to find.

Are you talking about formica, as in the formica they laminate to make
counter-tops?  I may have a source for that, I just never thought
there would be that much of a market for it.

As for mircarta, I've never heard of it before.  I'm going to have to
do some research - maybe I can find a source.

Thanks.

I remember FireFox - that was a great movie.  The book sequel sucked,
though.

On the subject of ways to block the more time-wasting efforts of ebay
designers,  this is what the other sellers came up with:

Firefox Tools &gt; Options &gt;Content &gt; uncheck &quot;Show pictures
automatically&quot;

Firefox has extensions that'll put a button on your toolbar to toggle
images.

And get the 'adblock' extension while you're at it. That will prevent
most of the common advertising from loading,
no matter what site you're on. It's a must for dial-up surfers.

For Internet Explorer: Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Scroll
down to Multimedia and clear the Show pictures box.

Opera has a &quot;Show Images&quot; button you can click to hide all images and
graphics as well as options to kill scripting,
sound and other multimedia.

So I hope that helps our dial-up friends.

OK, I've had a chance to go through some of those links you posted;

Re: Enco - those prices aren't THAT reasonable, IMO - I've got them
beat in nothing flat.  But I get your meaning.

I agree that I should put more info in the listings regarding the
specific manufacturer and grade of plastics when I can determine
them.  If I don't know, I believe I should not guess.  Bad information
is worse than no information.  I will look into that ASAP.

The formica looks interesting.  I believe that I have a source close
by.  I'm going to have to talk to then and see if they do have the
small pieces.  It might be a good addition to the selection.

Mircarta seems to be a mystery material to Google.  I'm glad you
provided the link to the manufacturer - I was beginning to wonder
where I could get information on this.  I don't know if it is
something I should carry or not, yet - I'll have to think about it.

I note that Delrin is also a common material for knife handles.  That
may be affecting my interest in the mircarta.

There may be some alternatives to the break-bulk idea you mentioned.
Some companies in Toronto, Ontario, do daily consolidated runs to
Buffalo each night - I'm going to check and see if I can consolidate
with them (or perhaps get them to take a tour through my area - we
have to have a lot of ebay material heading south from here.  I agree
that the shipping costs are problematic.

Thank you for your suggestions.  They have been very helpful.
