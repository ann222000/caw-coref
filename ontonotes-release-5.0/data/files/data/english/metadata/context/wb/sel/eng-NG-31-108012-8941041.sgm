Fine.  A Pound of Ground Beef, cooked and drained, and a can of kidney

Good start Jerry. ;-)

There is hope for you learning to cook yet!

Try adding a small bottle of V-8 juice to that in place of the tomato
sauce, and some _drained_ diced tomatoes. (Or even use some fresh
tomatoes and dice them up yourself with a good serrated knife).

Actually not.  _All_ chili powder contains garlic, cumin, oregano, and
chili pepper, and some contain other elements... but to be called
chili powder it MUST contain chile pepper, garlic, cumin, and oregano.
The cheaper ones contain lots of salt.  You've obviously never used

I call them &quot;Ground Chiles&quot; or &quot;Ground NewMexico Chiles&quot; or &quot;Ancho

&quot;chili powder&quot;.

Gebhardts chili powder.  It's good stuff.  They also make a product
called &quot;Chili Quik&quot; that really fits with this silly discussion about

&gt; &gt; &gt; Depends on the Chili powder.

&gt; &gt; Actually not.  _All_ chili powder contains garlic, cumin, oregano, and
&gt; &gt; chili pepper, and some contain other elements... but to be called
&gt; &gt; chili powder it MUST contain chile pepper, garlic, cumin, and oregano.
&gt; &gt; The cheaper ones contain lots of salt.  You've obviously never used
&gt; &gt; chili powder... it's patently obvious that you've never made chili
&gt; &gt; other than canned.

&gt; &gt; chili powder
&gt; &gt; A powdered seasoning mixture of dried CHILES, garlic, oregano, cumin,
&gt; &gt; coriander and cloves.

&gt; &gt; ? Copyright Barron's Educational Services, Inc. 1995 based on THE FOOD
&gt; &gt; LOVER'S COMPANION, 2nd edition, by Sharon Tyler Herbst.

&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; My home made chili powder contains dried powdered chiles.

&gt; Period.

&gt; I call it chile powder.
">

You can call it TEXAS DUMB CUNT POWDER for all anyone cares.. but
plain powdered chili pepper is Powdered/Ground Chili Pepper... NOT
Chili Powder.

Perhaps if you got some of that TEXAS DUMB CUNT POWDER and dusted it
on a DUMB TEXAS CUNT it will SMART!!!!

Ahahahahahahahaha. . . .

I missed the first part of the thread.  Chili Quik actually tastes
pretty good.  I just can't quite bring myself to call it chili unless
you thin it way down with water (or beef broth) and simmer it a long

Sure, but 10 minutes? There's no time for the flavors to meld. I
cook the meat &amp; veggies for my chili in a large cast iron pan, then
putting the tomato sauce, seasonings, and beans in the crock pot.
Add the meat mixture, then let it cook in the crock pot for a couple

We rarely eat chili so when I do make it (usually in the winter), I'd
rather take my time and do it from scratch. I may or may not add beans
depending on my mood.

How very rude. You certainly don't have much of any importance to say,
do you?

&quot;Chili powder (also spelled chile powder) is a generic name for any
powdered spice mix composed chiefly of chili peppers, most commonly
either red peppers or cayenne peppers, which are both of the species
Capsicum annuum. The spice mix may simply be pure powdered chilis, or
it may have other additives, especially cumin, oregano, and garlic. [1]
[2] Some mixes may even include black pepper, cinnamon, cloves,
coriander, mace, nutmeg, or turmeric. [citation needed] As a result of
the various different potential additives, the spiciness of any given
chili powder is incredibly variable. As a rule, the purer the chili
powder is, the more spicy it is.

Use of powdered chili peppers can be traced, at its earliest, to
Indian cuisine, where such powders were used in curry dishes, but
today they are especially popular in American cuisine, where they are
the primary flavor ingredient in chili con carne. The first commercial
blends of chili powder in the U.S. were created in the 1890s by D.C.
Pendery and William Gebhardt for precisely this dish. [3]&quot;

&gt; I call them &quot;Ground Chiles&quot; or &quot;Ground NewMexico Chiles&quot; or &quot;Ancho
&gt; Chiles&quot; or &quot;Guajillo Chiles&quot; (etc.) just to avoid the confusion with
&gt; &quot;chili powder&quot;.
