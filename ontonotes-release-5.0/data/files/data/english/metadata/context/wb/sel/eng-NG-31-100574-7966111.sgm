[17:50] * KK has joined #deryni_destinations
[17:50] &lt;DeryniBot&gt; Hi there KK! Welcome to the chat.
[17:50] &lt;Samuel&gt; Hi KK
[17:50] &lt;the_Bee&gt; hi KK!
[17:50] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; Greetings, KK!
[17:50] &lt;Mistyck&gt; hiyas Katherine
[17:50] &lt;KK&gt; Hi, gang!
[17:50] &lt;jemler&gt; hey KK!
[17:50] &lt;JastaElf&gt; Hi Katherine
[17:51] &lt;KK&gt; So, what's everybody been up to?
[17:51] &lt;the_Bee&gt; trying to stay cool
[17:51] &lt;Mistyck&gt; getting ready to go to Corpus Christi tomorrow
[17:51] &lt;JastaElf&gt; (Sorry RD I missed your question--unpacking is
proceeding apace, thanks!)
[17:51] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; same ol', same ol' here
[17:51] &lt;KK&gt; What's in Corpus Christi?
[17:52] &lt;Mistyck&gt; we're having our annual counter drug program
conference
[17:52] &lt;KK&gt; RD, I, too, am still unpacking.  But floor has been
discovered.
[17:52] &lt;Mistyck&gt; every year we pick a different city in TX to go
to...kind of fun
[17:52] &lt;KK&gt; Ah.  A worthy occupation.
[17:52] &lt;JastaElf&gt; *g*  I found some floor too.  Was very surprised.
[17:52] &lt;Mistyck&gt; good to hear about the floor KK and Jasta :D
[17:53] &lt;KK&gt; I'll bet you've got more floor uncovered than I
do....though progress is being made.
[17:53] &lt;the_Bee&gt; yes. standing in midair can get tiresome :)
[17:53] &lt;JastaElf&gt; :-) And it amuses the neighbors so.
[17:53] &lt;KK&gt; Alas, the creative process can't resume until order has
been mostly imposed.  But the new laptops should arrive this week, and
my new laser printer.
[17:53] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; no... they hop from item of furniture to item
or furniture
[17:54] &lt;Mistyck&gt; cool KK regarding the laptops and printer
[17:54] &lt;KK&gt; The cats get very creative, in between &quot;helping.&quot;
[17:54] &lt;the_Bee&gt; who? the neighbors?
[17:54] &lt;Bynw&gt; Hi KK, i was &quot;away&quot; for a moment
[17:54] &lt;KK&gt; Hi, Bynw.  Good to see you back.
[17:54] &lt;the_Bee&gt; what have the cats created?
[17:55] &lt;KK&gt; I've copied down what my computer is telling me about
that script error in Outlook Express, and will send it to you
tomorrow.  Didn't want to intrude while you were otherside occupied.
[17:56] &lt;KK&gt; We are presently engaged in the battle of the groundhogs,
about 3 of which have invaded our garden and are eating all out
tenant's tomato plants.
[17:56] &lt;Mistyck&gt; oh fun
[17:56] &lt;Bynw&gt; i like the distractions actually. i have a lot of work
to do in the next few weeks and months settling the estate
[17:56] &lt;KK&gt; The Critter-Getter has been engaged to dispose of the
critters.
[17:56] &lt;Mistyck&gt; hehe
[17:57] &lt;KK&gt; Ah, then.  I'll bombard you tomorrow.  :-)
[17:57] &lt;the_Bee&gt; have you ever tasted groundhog?  I've heard it used
to be fairly popular.
[17:57] &lt;Bynw&gt; weee fun
[17:57] &lt;Samuel&gt; Caddyshack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[17:57] &lt;the_Bee&gt; estate?
[17:57] * Temprus has joined #deryni_destinations
[17:57] &lt;DeryniBot&gt; Samuel welcomes Temprus to the chat with a bottle
of mead.
[17:57] &lt;KK&gt; The dog seems to think they're cats; no interest in
chasing or killing them.  There are no groundhogs in Ireland.
[17:57] &lt;jemler&gt; Carl the groundskeeper!
[17:57] &lt;Mistyck&gt; Hiyas Temp
[17:57] * Bynw thinks of the line from &quot;O Brother Where art thou&quot; ....
&quot;Gopher Everett&quot;
[17:57] &lt;Temprus&gt; Howdy all
[17:58] &lt;the_Bee&gt; hi temprus
[17:58] &lt;KK&gt; I've occasionally seen then at the side of the road, dead
and otherwise, but none of our denizens.  And the cats don't seem
bothered, either.
[17:59] &lt;Bynw&gt; the_Bee, my mom passed away due to cancer last monday.
we had the funeral yesterday.
[17:59] &lt;Mistyck&gt; bet they don't know what those are either
[17:59] &lt;KK&gt; They're a whole lot better than I thought, though.
[17:59] &lt;the_Bee&gt; :( bynw
[17:59] &lt;Mistyck&gt; Bynw, I'm so sorry to hear that.  My condolensces
[17:59] * duck has joined #deryni_destinations
[17:59] &lt;DeryniBot&gt; Samuel welcomes duck to the chat with a bottle of
mead.
[17:59] &lt;Mistyck&gt; hiyas Duck
[18:00] &lt;the_Bee&gt; hi Duck!
[18:00] &lt;jemler&gt; everybody duck!
[18:00] &lt;duck&gt; hello people
[18:00] &lt;KK&gt; Is that our downunder duck?!
[18:00] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; yep!
[18:00] &lt;duck&gt; it is indeed
[18:00] &lt;duck&gt; welcome back to the states katherine
[18:00] &lt;KK&gt; Wheee!  Welcome back!  (Or maybe you've been around all
the while, and I've just managed not to be here at the same time.)
[18:00] &lt;jemler&gt; eider downunder duck
[18:01] &lt;Bynw&gt; wow we have a duck, a KK and a JastaElf
[18:01] &lt;KK&gt; Thanks.  It's good here in Virginia.
[18:01] &lt;Mistyck&gt; almost like old times Bynw
[18:01] &lt;KK&gt; Good one, Jemler!
[18:02] &lt;KK&gt; Duck, I was telling them about our groundhog invasion--
and the Critter-Getter we've hired to eliminate them.
[18:02] &lt;KK&gt; Some of them are really BIG!
[18:02] &lt;the_Bee&gt; do they have a gopher-equivalent in Oz?
[18:03] * ambush has joined #deryni_destinations
[18:03] &lt;DeryniBot&gt; Hi there ambush! Welcome to the chat.
[18:03] &lt;Mistyck&gt; hiyas Ambush
[18:03] &lt;the_Bee&gt; hi ambush
[18:03] * ambush waves
[18:03] &lt;KK&gt; Groundhogs aren't the same as gophers, are they?  I
honestly don't know.
[18:03] &lt;the_Bee&gt; I thought they were. different names, same critter
[18:03] &lt;ambush&gt; not that i know of they arent
[18:04] &lt;KK&gt; How big are gophers?
[18:04] * JastaElf hugs Duck :-)
[18:04] &lt;jemler&gt; we may need a bigger room!
[18:04] &lt;the_Bee&gt; oh, right groundhog=woodchuck, not gopher
[18:04] &lt;ambush&gt; they're different vritters
[18:04] &lt;KK&gt; Ah, but Jemler, we've had our roommate list all the way
to the bottom of the page.  Bynw, what was our record attendance?
[18:04] &lt;Mistyck&gt; they're different
[18:05] &lt;jemler&gt; woodhog = groundchuck, let's eat!
[18:05] &lt;KK&gt; Groundhogs are woodchucks?
[18:05] &lt;the_Bee&gt; I think so
[18:05] &lt;Mistyck&gt; yeah KK
[18:05] &lt;Bynw&gt; i dont remember i know we had at least 2x what we have
now and more before
[18:05] &lt;KK&gt; Do they really chuck wood?
[18:05] &lt;JastaElf&gt; LOL!
[18:05] &lt;the_Bee&gt; of course! ;)
[18:06] &lt;Mistyck&gt; good ol' wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog
[18:06] &lt;Temprus&gt; Woodchuck = Groundhog
[18:06] &lt;Mistyck&gt; I thought 31 or 34 was our record
[18:06] &lt;ambush&gt; wikipedia is awesome
[18:06] &lt;jemler&gt; woodhog = groundchuck
[18:06] &lt;KK&gt; Well, on reflection, though, maybe not.  The question
asks how much they could chuck if they &lt;could&gt; chuck wood--implying
that maybe they can't.
[18:07] * ambush shakes his head and giggles
[18:07] &lt;the_Bee&gt; ground hog=hamburg
[18:07] &lt;the_Bee&gt; or sausage
[18:07] &lt;jemler&gt; and that's CHUCK not CHUNDER!
[18:07] &lt;Temprus&gt; giggles? ;D
[18:07] &lt;Mistyck&gt; lol
[18:07] &lt;the_Bee&gt; chunder?
[18:08] &lt;jemler&gt; it's all yours. dov
[18:08] &lt;KK&gt; Well, they're going to be dead groundhogs, or woodchucks,
or whatever they are!  The Critter-Getter caught 4-5 in our back
neighbor's yard, so maybe the survivors have moved over here, where
they can burrow under the boxwoods.
[18:08] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; me no see Dov
[18:08] &lt;duck&gt; thus was the festillic invasion of gwynedd foiled by
the failure of the secret weapon, woodchucks, refusing to chuck wooden
objects
[18:08] &lt;jemler&gt; the last time i answered this question, i had to
apologize to everybody! :)
[18:08] &lt;the_Bee&gt; dov left
[18:08] &lt;Mistyck&gt; lol duck
[18:09] &lt;KK&gt; I hope they aren't &lt;that&gt; big, Duck!
[18:09] &lt;jemler&gt; my mistake. duck is the one from Australia.
[18:09] &lt;KK&gt; From and in.
[18:10] &lt;KK&gt; You &lt;are&gt; in Oz right now, aren't you?
[18:10] &lt;jemler&gt; say hi to the wizard for me!
[18:10] &lt;duck&gt; yes - a cloudy rainy monday morning here now
[18:10] &lt;jemler&gt; water off of duck's back
[18:11] &lt;the_Bee&gt; is winter mostly rain or snow there?
[18:11] &lt;KK&gt; That must be a welcome relief, with the droughts you've
been having.
[18:11] &lt;Mistyck&gt; yeah..at least no big fires like Utah is having
right now
[18:11] &lt;duck&gt; it is very much welcome rain - first decent winter
rains in many years
[18:11] &lt;KK&gt; Utah's getting fires right now?  (We haven't got our TV
yet--waiting for the stand.)
[18:12] &lt;the_Bee&gt; the western half of the USA seems to be having
either fires or floods
[18:12] &lt;Mistyck&gt; there's a huge one there KK, they were talking about
people having to be evacuated
[18:12] &lt;KK&gt; What part of Utah?
[18:12] &lt;Mistyck&gt; south of Salt Lake City I do believe
[18:12] &lt;duck&gt; those californian fires were put out then?
[18:13] &lt;the_Bee&gt; anyone know?  I HAVEN'T HEARD THE LATEST
[18:13] &lt;the_Bee&gt; sorry didn't realize caps lock was on.
[18:13] &lt;Mistyck&gt; central Utah
[18:14] &lt;Mistyck&gt; http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/nation/4988259.html
[18:15] &lt;KK&gt; Scott reminds me that groundhogs/woodchucks are also
called whistle-pigs, for some unknown reason.
[18:15] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; maybe they make a whistling noise?
[18:15] &lt;KK&gt; Dunno.
[18:16] &lt;Samuel&gt; because of teh whistle sounds they make
[18:17] &lt;KK&gt; So one would presume, though I've not heard them.
Wondered, though, whether they would make some awful noise when they
spring the traps--which the Critter-Getter assures me do not catch
cats!  I was concerned about that, needless to say.
[18:17] &lt;Samuel&gt; just think of the one chr from &quot;Whinny the Pooh&quot;
[18:18] &lt;KK&gt; There's a groundhog/woodchuck in Pooh?
[18:18] &lt;duck&gt; the heffalump trap for poohs
[18:18] &lt;the_Bee&gt; Piglet? i thought he was a pig
[18:18] &lt;duck&gt; or was it the pooh trap for heffalumps that piglet fell
into
[18:18] &lt;the_Bee&gt; I think so
[18:19] &lt;KK&gt; Well, I certainly hope we don't have heffalumps in our
back garden!
[18:19] &lt;duck&gt; how about some nice possums to go in the roof?
[18:19] &lt;jemler&gt; why did the elephant paint his toenails red?
[18:19] &lt;the_Bee&gt; or Pooh got his head stuck in the homeypot and
piglet thought he was a heffalump
[18:19] &lt;Samuel&gt; I think it was one of the pooh shows
[18:19] &lt;the_Bee&gt; to match his lipstick?
[18:20] &lt;jemler&gt; no, to hide in the strawbeyy patch
[18:20] &lt;jemler&gt; strawberry, sorry
[18:20] &lt;the_Bee&gt; I remember heffalump from book
[18:20] &lt;KK&gt; Ah.  Well, apparently groundhogs and possums and other
critters occasionally crawl under the cottage to die.  I told the
Critter-Getter yesterday that if that happens, &lt;he&gt; is the one to go
under and get them out.  He said he doesn't mind.
[18:21] &lt;duck&gt; well people time for me to catch my bus and return to
work after 3 weeks off
[18:21] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; Is Scott the critter-getter?
[18:21] &lt;duck&gt; have a good rest of the weekend all and sundry
[18:21] &lt;Mistyck&gt; have a good day duck
[18:21] &lt;the_Bee&gt; g'day Duck
[18:21] * duck Quit
[18:21] &lt;KK&gt; Bye, Duck!  Good to see you again.
[18:21] &lt;jemler&gt; bye, duck
[18:22] &lt;KK&gt; No, the Critter-Getter is a retired veteran/reenactor who
supplements his military pension (and supports his reenaccting hobby)
by catching pest critters.
[18:22] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; aha!
[18:23] &lt;KK&gt; It's a catchy name for what he does.  People don't
forget.
[18:24] &lt;KK&gt; Aha, a Tillie cat on my lap. telling me it's cuddle-time.
[18:24] &lt;jemler&gt; kk, a little word game for you -where did the word
critter come from?
[18:24] &lt;KK&gt; I have no idea.  A short form for creature?
[18:24] &lt;jemler&gt; works for me :)
[18:25] &lt;the_Bee&gt; dialect, maybe
[18:25] &lt;the_Bee&gt; KK, what's this Libertycon you're going to next
week?
[18:25] &lt;KK&gt; It's a good generic term for assorted creatures.  The
collective for our dog and 5 cats is critters.
[18:25] &lt;jemler&gt; i think it's kinda like yantoo.
[18:26] &lt;KK&gt; As in, Have the critters been fed? Or, I have to take the
critters to the kennel.
[18:26] &lt;the_Bee&gt; yantoo?
[18:26] &lt;jemler&gt; you can take care of that if yantoo.
[18:26] &lt;the_Bee&gt; ah
[18:26] &lt;jemler&gt; tou want to :)
[18:26] &lt;Samuel&gt; yawanna
[18:26] &lt;KK&gt; It's a really good SF con held in Catanooga, TN. I
believe this is their 20th anniversary.  David Weber is one of the
GOH's!
[18:26] &lt;jemler&gt; dyslexic keyboard (you want too)
[18:27] &lt;KK&gt; Chatanooga
[18:27] &lt;jemler&gt; you too ;)
[18:27] &lt;the_Bee&gt; choo choo!
[18:27] &lt;KK&gt; Cat-impaired keyboard
[18:27] &lt;Bynw&gt; KK ... you should post your convention schedule to
rhemuthcastle.com :-)
[18:27] &lt;KK&gt; Tillie is &quot;helping.&quot;
[18:28] &lt;KK&gt; When I catch my breath, I will.
[18:28] &lt;the_Bee&gt; hi tillie
[18:28] &lt;Mistyck&gt; that's a great idea.  That way, some of us may be
able to come visit you at these various cons
[18:29] &lt;KK&gt; Well, this furry madam in my lap is insisting that it's
time to feed the cats, the dog already having been fed, so it isn't
critters who need to be fed.
[18:29] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; cats are always starving to death
[18:29] &lt;KK&gt; Anyway, I won't be on line next week, since we'll be in
the Big Nooga, as they call it in parts farther south.
[18:30] &lt;KK&gt; You guys take care, though.  See you in 2 weeks, same Bat
Time, same Bat Station.
[18:30] &lt;the_Bee&gt; we'll be here
[18:31] &lt;jemler&gt; till then
[18:31] * KK steps onto her Portal, waves goodbye, and disappears in a
shower of green sparkles.
[18:31] &lt;RainbowDragon&gt; Thank you for stopping by, KK
[18:31] &lt;KK&gt; TTFN
[18:31] * KK Quit
[18:31] * KK has left IRC
[18:32] &lt;jemler&gt; and then, depression sets in...
