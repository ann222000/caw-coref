So says the US corporate media, politicians.  One of them is the very
vocal,  and distinguished Democratic Senator of  Michigan,  Carl Levin
of the Senate's Arms Committee.

But hardly ever asked;  WHY? Why should they stand up?

I attempt to give some answers as I see it.

Carl Levin or Bush The Lesser generally may phrase it this way;
We scarified blood and money for the Iraqi people, we gave them freedom.
They must fight for it themselves too.

Well, actually we were not invited to invade Iraq. There were  3-6
months window, that the Bush regime could have been seen as liberators,
if they would have left  Iraq after that. But of course WMD's or
liberation were not the reason for the invasion. The  advocates of
'stand up' are  to force  the  dirty  job  of  instituting the
neoliberal economy, 'colonization'  to be done by the Iraqis. Yes, we
scarified blood and money, the blood of innocent soldier, who were not
asked for consent, the money of taxpayers  for the enrichment of the
corporate oligarchy.

So, why would/ would not the Iraqi government 'stand up'?

Why would? They would be well rewarded by the Bush regime to execute its
plan. The down side is that their family and probably themselves would
be killed, assuming they have no scruples collaborating with the occupiers.

Why would not? The US can not afford to abandon them. A retirement in
Florida is assured.
