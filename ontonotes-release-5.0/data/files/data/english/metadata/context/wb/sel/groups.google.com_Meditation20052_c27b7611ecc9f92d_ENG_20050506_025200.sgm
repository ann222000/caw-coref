Hi All
Namaskar

Elevating mind and self is the real emphasis of meditation practices.

The importance of hatha yoga (ie physical postures) is that the body
must be kept in good condition to allow for proper concentration and
meditation. So take care of it through proper exercise. Yogic postures
are those inner exercises for the glands and hormonal system of the
body. Also, on the physical level is careful attention to diet and how
one eats, including when not to eat and even fasting.

Intellectual knowledge is primarily an aid to personal understanding of
the spirit of meditation and yoga. This is also called jinana yoga
(pronounced gyah-nah) and teaches the ideal of nondualism - that the
Macrocosmic Manifestation is singular. This is important in meditation
because you identify your small self with the Universal. Perceptions of
countless distinct phenomena arise through the limitations of our
sensory organs. Meditation attempts to experience the wholeness of
everything and this comes from mental elevation and internal
experiential feeling. What we experience through the external sense
organs is a relative truth. What we experience through 'internal
sensing' or meditation is that which is lasting within - the essence of
existence.

In yoga the universe is a 'living' Consciousness and bears a
relationship (direct and indirect) with every entity. It is surely the
best way of seeing and experiencing the world. Meditation does not
attempt to experience some dry void or nothingness or is done for the
mere counting of breaths. Rather it is a means of transcending the
present level of consciousness and realising the oneness of the
Universal Expression. This is the spiritual emphasis.

In sleep and dream you could say you also transcend your immediate
conscious world, but meditation is deeper than that and deals with the
supramental or superconscious mind. We all feel we have an element of
existence that is more than our ordinary self (whether awake, dream or
sleep). In simple terms we want to reach our inner self.

Theory is one thing, but through the practice of meditation this is
where the real experience comes. That practice may take some time to
be established in daily life, but is necessary. Physical well-being
and intellectual knowledge of yoga supports the practical day to day
lifestyle and practice of meditation. The basis of meditation is
ideation (focus), internal feeling and mantra (subtle vibrational root
sounds of the mind and psychic structure of the body used to elevate
the mind in meditation).

In that practice and lifestyle, proper action is important also (as is
proper thought). This is called karma yoga in Sanskrit. It means to
regulate how you act in the world. Karma yoga is acting with
integrity.

There is a categorisation of yogic practices called raja yoga
(pronounced rah-jah) meaning literally &quot;royal yoga&quot; and it is also
known as classical yoga. When you mingle with meditation practitioners
long enough, you can expect to hear them refer to the eightfold path,
as codified in the Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali. This is the standard work
of Raja Yoga. The eight limbs of yoga are:

- external moral/ethical discipline
- internal moral/ethical strength
- yogic postures
- proper breathing
- withdrawal of senses from the external world to internalise your
consciousness for meditation
- concentration, or extended mental focusing, fundamental to yogic
meditation
- process of meditation, the principal practice of bringing your mind
to ideate on Oneness
- experience of unitive consciousness so as to feel inwardly one with
the feeling of Infinite Peace

All these aspects are useful to the meditation practitioner. They are
tools to the actual meditation practice. The experience or
experiential is what is counts. This is emphasised with group
participation in meditation collectives.

As mentioned, diet is important. Converse to this is giving the body
(and mind) a rest from eating. In April 2003 the NewScientist.com news
service covered this matter. Here is the article.

Day-on, day-off diet boosts health
22:00 28 April 03

Eating double portions one day and nothing the next delivers the same
health benefits to mice as seen in animals whose lifespan has been
extended by restricting their calorie intake.

No one is suggesting people adopt such a diet. But the study adds to
the evidence that caloric restriction works by activating some kind of
protective mechanism, rather than simply being a result of eating less
and thus suffering less damage as food is metabolised. If this is the
case, there may be ways to switch on the protective mechanism without
going on a crazy diet. Both calorie restriction and intermittent
fasting prompt cells in the body to set up defences against stress that
also protect against ageing and degenerative diseases, concludes team
member Mark Mattson, at the US National Institute on Aging's
Gerontology Research Center in Baltimore.

These might be adaptations that benefited people in the past. &quot;A
three-meals-a-day diet only occurred recently in human evolution,&quot; he
says. &quot;Often we were probably forced to go days without food.&quot;

But whether such a radical diet would benefit people now is not clear.
Mice that start a restricted diet late in life do not always live
longer. Furthermore, while occasional one-day fasts are thought to be
harmless, they are not necessarily pleasant. &quot;People feel tired,
irritable and lethargic,&quot; says Alex Johnstone of the Rowett
Research Institute in Scotland.

Long life

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From worms to mice, virtually every kind of animal fed a reduced

"/> calorie diet has been found to live longer - up to 40 per cent longer
in some cases. But it has yet to be shown that such a diet extends
human life.

Previous studies suggested intermittent fasting might also extend
lifespan. But as most rats and mice lose weight on such a diet, it was
not clear if this was really any different from caloric restriction. So
Mattson and his colleagues tried it on a strain of mice that does not
lose weight on a day-on, day-off diet. From the age of nine weeks,
they let one group of mice eat freely, fed another group 40 per cent
less than the eat-all-you-like group and gave a third group all they
wanted one day and
nothing the next.

The mice on the reduced calorie diet weighed only about half as much as
those allowed to eat all they wanted. But the intermittently fed mice
did not lose any weight, since they ate almost twice as much on days
when they were allowed food.

Low insulin

Crucially, these mice displayed most of the same physiological changes
as mice on restricted diets. Levels of glucose and insulin in the blood
of fasting mice were even lower than those on a restricted diet, both
factors that may contribute to increased longevity.

Caloric restriction has also been shown to protect against
neurodegenerative diseases and the brain cells of the fasting mice were
better at withstanding exposure to a neurotoxin than those of mice on a
restricted diet. However, Johnstone warns against people adopting
something as radical as the day-on, day-off diet without medical
supervision: the dangers include sudden death due to heart failure.
Fasting for a longer period, such as a week, is also dangerous, her
work shows. Both Johnstone and Mattson are now planning studies
looking at the effects of intermittent fasting in people.
