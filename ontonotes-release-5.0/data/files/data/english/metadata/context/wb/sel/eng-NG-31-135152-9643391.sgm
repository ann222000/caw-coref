You might want to check the battery.  when those go bad there are all
sorts of strange problems that develop.  The other thing would be to
try and reseat the card and see if that helps.

yes... I think it also may be that the power supply is
tired...  I am having a similar but not identical problem
with a IIci with a DayStar FastCache.  Only 2 cards
installed - Cache and EtherNet.  Pulling either sometimes
lt will boot.  Sometimes get the powerlight flashing start
stop start stop.  It had been run for years with a full
load of NuBus and rarely switched off.  If you leave them
off for too long the caps discharge and get tired.  I'll
get it going tho&quot;

I think that IIci power supplies were pushed to the limit
with a full load of NuBus.  I'm sure someone is selling
re-cons.
