Murray thrashed by Baghdatis

August 15 2007 at 02:25AM

Cincinnati, Ohio - Britain's Andy Murray continued to struggle as he
recovers from a wrist injury, losing 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday to Marcos Baghdatis
in the first round of the ATP Cincinnati Masters.

The unseeded Cypriot needed a mere 48 minutes to send the Scotsman to a
lopsided loss for a second straight week.

In Montreal, the 16th-ranked standout who missed three months with his wrist
tendon trouble beat Robby Ginepri in his first match back then lost badly to
Italian qualifier Fabio Fognini.

&quot;I was hitting the ball harder today off my forehand and hitting topspin
returns,&quot; said Murray, who was inside the top 10 before his injury in
Hamburg on May 15.

&quot;It was definitely better but there's just a lot of things that I wasn't
really doing well. I wasn't moving fluidly which is normally the one thing
that I do really well.

&quot;Moving badly and not hitting my forehand 100 percent. The combination of
those two things and also playing against a great player like Marcos doesn't
help.&quot;

Murray said he will train before going to next week's event in New Haven,
his last chance to prepare before the US Open starts on August 27.

&quot;I've only played a few matches since I came back,&quot; he said. &quot;The movement
and the anticipation are the things that might take a bit of time to come
back.&quot;

Lleyton Hewitt struggled for a shade under three hours to subdue Swiss
Stanislas Wawrinka 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5).

The former world number one, a two-time finalist at the US Midwest event,
overcame a patchy day on serve with eight double-faults and just four aces.

Wawrinka, the number two Swiss behind Roger Federer, played the final on
clay in Stuttgart against Rafael Nadal last month but has been unable to
carry over that form.

The world number 49 has won just one match out of his last four.

Hewitt admitted that he faced a battle: &quot;I'm relieved to get through,&quot; said
the Australian. &quot;He really took it to me.

&quot;We both had a lot of chances in the first set, I can't really say there was
a turning point.&quot;

Hewitt improved to 19-6 at Cincinnati as he works long distance with coach
Tony Roche in Sydney during the build-up to the US Open starting August 27.

Roche remains at home awaiting the birth of a grandchild.

Hewitt missed the event last year due to a knee injury which kept him out of
the Open in New York.

Federer and Nadal learned the names of second-round opponents as Julien
Benneteau and Juan Monaco won through.

Frenchman Benneteau defeated Russian Dmitry Tursunov 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 to move
into a match-up against Federer while Argentine Monaco faces Nadal by virtue
of a 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 defeat of Spain's Feliciano Lopez.

Robby Ginepri became the third American into the second round with a win
over Swede Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 6-3.
