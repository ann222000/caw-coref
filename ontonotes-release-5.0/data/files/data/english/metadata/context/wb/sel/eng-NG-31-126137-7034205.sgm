Further to my postings about the stupid centre clip used
by Kino on ASPHALT ... I had the pleasure of watching two
other Kinos over the weekend: the 2000 (?) version of
ROBIN HOOD, and the 2006 version of MABUSE.

Each of these three DVD's uses a different kind of centre
clip.  ASPHALT's is by far the worst -- I really had a
hell of a time wrenching it out of that box.

My question is, why does there seem to be no consistency
in the kind of centre clip Kino uses?  Are they so wealthy
(ha ha ha ha) that they can afford to hire somebody to
design a different clip for each release?

And in a slight segue here, how is the name "Mabuse"
pronounced?  I used to assume it was "Mah-byooz", but
now I'm wondering if it is "May-booz".

Graf von Galitzen, can you weigh in here, please?

I was about to snap back  "Haven't you heard the commentary?"  but then I
looked and saw , er, gee I was stupid..... anyhow, according to that it's
pronounced "Mah-BOO-Seh.  It should rhyme somewhat with Confuse, but with
three sylables and the "eh" at the end.

Still, the commentator says this was blithely ignored in the American dubs
of the 1960's Mabuse films- a tag line read: "He Kills and Kills without
excuse / This is the method of Dr Mabuse"

It's not like Kino has rows and rows of little elves making these
discs and cases by hand.  I'm sure they're manufactured at some plant
along with millions of other DVDs and while they may spec the basics
of the case (so the label fits and so on) the precise clip is probably
some quirk of the manufacturing plant and what they got 1 cent off per
unit on ten million of.  Kino's clip is probably a result of what
Disney or Sony spec'd on their big job being pressed at the same time.

Try watching "The Testament of Dr. Mabuse" - (1933)
His name is bantered about constantly throughout
the flick.

There are a great many places making DVD cases.   I buy 100 at a
time - and even though they come with the same dealer label the
small details of each shipment vary.

I doubt that any company such as Disney or Sony specify how the
cases are to be made, however they may have a choice of model
numbers.  It really makes no sense for a label to manufacture cases
as a plastics manufacturing facility could beat them on prices
since they sell to many places.

I'm German and this is the correct pronunciation!!Only one slight change
though to Mah-boo-zeh since the German S is voiced.

Yes it is, but as I tried to allude in my post (and you may not be aware)
James Roots is deaf and reads subtitles.

Thanks, Eric. Makes sense -- it's the European pronunciation.

My association makes DVD versions of our publications (i.e., we
put a Sign language version of the publication on a DVD) and we
order the cases in bulk, separately from the discs themselves.
I figured Kino would do the same, only in much greater bulk
(ten million, as you suggest?), and this ought to lead to
consistency throughout most of their product (as large as their
catalogue is, ten million copies ought to use the same centre
clip).  But that doesn't seem to work in real life.

Thanks, everyone.

Now, if you would like to know how anything is "pronounced"
in ASL, feel free to ask me!

I do have a question:  How is different emphasis or inflections
handled?  For example:

WHAT are you doing?

What ARE you doing?

What are YOU doing?

What are you DOING?

Each of those variations has a slightly different meaning, even to the
point of some (like the first and last) implying a degree of anger.
Does sign language deal with that?  Is it simply the look on the
signer's face?  Are sarcasm and things like that handled the same way?

By the way, PBS here has a short little show on in the mornings that
teaches young kids sign language and our 4 year-old loves it.  She's
learned quite a few words.  Between her English vocabulary, sign
language vocabulary, and Spanish vocabulary (from Dora The Explorer),
she's getting to be quite a little language expert.

This assumes we are signing a specific sign for each word.  That
doesn't happen in ASL.

"What are you doing?" is signed in its entirety with a single
sign -- the "DO-DO" sign.  Palm turned inward, the 3 outer
fingers folded flat against the palm, and the upraised index
finger and thumb tapping against each other.  It is supposed
to represent fingerspelling the letters D-O, but over time it
has become "lazy signing" so it's hard to see the letters now.
The tapping is why it isn't just "the DO sign" but rather the
"DO-DO" sign -- repetition of the gesture.

With such a simple sign, all emphasis comes through the face.
A friendly or indifferent expression turns it into a routine
query like "How are you this morning?"  Cocked eyebrows turn
it into the puzzled, "What the heck are you doing?"  A scowl
or frown turn it into a demand,  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!?!"

We would almost never emphasize conjunctives like "are".  These
terms don't exist in real ASL.

Yeah.  For sarcasms, I would tilt my head back a little, put a
bit of a sneer or snicker on my mouth, and "DO-DO?" in a
"c'mon, you little putz, what are you trying to pull?" manner.

The other day I was stunned to see two entire bookshelves filled
with baby/infant Sign books at my local bookstore.  But I would
advise you to avoid the Disney crap from Baby Einstein.  Go for
the stuff from small presses that were produced by Deaf people
you never heard of (i.e., not Linda Bove or Marlee Matlin).
It's not that Linda or Marlee are not authentic Signers, it's
that they have been forced to peddle stuff that is actually
Seeing Exact English (SEE) rather than real ASL.  SEE is not
a language, it is a "sign system" artificially created to
equate one English word with one sign.  And as I think I've
made clear in this posting, ASL doesn't work on a one-to-one
basis with English.
