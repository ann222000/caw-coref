Dear Diary,

Today is a day to be remembered, a day that will shine brighter than
any other in the annals of history. For I, Deathblow (n√©e Daniel
Rosenberg), have formed a band: Sockhop Babykill Redux. Our music will
bring false prophets to their knees as it cuts a swath through the
niggling trivialities of daily life, a swath that will reveal nothing
but pure, blinding truth. Kings will weep when they gaze upon us, weep
with the knowledge that despite their royal splendor they will never
amount to anything but a fraction of our collective, splendid worth.

We're still short a bassist, though. We're having open auditions for
the spot.

Dear Diary,

What luck! We have already found our bassist. She is a goddess when she
plays, she and her bass becoming inextricably intertwined to form a
singular entity of stunning beauty and grace. Her name is Festering Axe
Wound.

Dear Diary,

Here's the note my roommate/bandmate left on the fridge this morning:

&quot;Deathblow,

I am off to secure a gig for Sockhop Babykill Redux. Once our
performances begin, we will become a plague unto this land, wrapping
ourselves around northeast Richmond like a foul mist. With music in our
hearts and hatred in our voices we will wake up these accursed zombies,
releasing buckets of bile from their filthy, rotten throats as they
realize what a horrific charade this despicable American scream has
become!

Bloodslurp

P.S. We need milk.&quot;

Why is it always I who must obtain milk, Diary? Why is it always
I?!?!?!?!?!

Dear Diary,

All hail Bloodslurp!!!!! My intrepid roommate and drummer has secured
us a show two weeks hence at Mike's Bar and Grill, which, according to
Bloodslurp, consists of a sickeningly banal midrange eatery underneath
a large, accommodating musical venue. I inquired as to how he fulfilled
his mission without so much as a demo tape, but he wouldn't say.
Mysterious are the ways of Bloodslurp.

In other news, something seems to be brewing between Festering Axe
Wound and me. Tonight at practice she kept complimenting me on how &quot;so
very primordial&quot; I looked, and then she did this crazy solo while
staring at me the whole time, her tongue flicking out seductively every
few seconds like some sort of beautiful iguana. An intriguing
development, old friend.

Swampfiend said he saw it too.

Dear Diary,

It's official: Festering Axe Wound and I are a pair. We consummated our
union behind the Stake 'n' Shake in a manner so frenzied, so visceral,
so ... CARNAL that, had we filmed it, even Frey, Norse god of fertility
and love, would have had no choice but to order it on pay-per-view in
his motel room. It was a night I will never forget, and it occurred in
the familiar surroundings of my mother's van, which she lent me for the
evening.

Oh, and also, it turns out that Festering Axe Wound is Jewish. Weird.

Dear Diary,

Writer's block. The suffocating algal bloom that can suddenly infest
even the healthiest, most free-flowing fonts of creativity. And now it
has struck me, its most unlikely victim! I simply cannot figure out
where to go with this song I am writing. The first line is good: &quot;I
will kiss you with your intestines wrapped around your face. / I hate
you so much I love you, you cheap disgrace.&quot; After that, however, I am
at a complete loss. The tortured life of the genius is not to be
envied, Diary.

Dear Diary,

I knew things were too good to be true. Earlier today I received a call
from a representative of Mike's Bar and Grill, who was checking to make
sure we were still on for our &quot;open mike&quot; performance. OPEN MIKE?!?!?!?
OPEN MIKE IS FOR ADDLED, PIMPLE-STRICKEN TEENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE ARE
SOCKHOP BABYKILL REDUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks, Bloodslurp. Way to be honest with the rest of the band.

Dear Diary,

The show was a complete disaster! Curses upon Mike's Pub! May that foul
establishment burn, burn, burn for all eternity! I was talking to the
manager, Carl, yesterday, and I explained to him in no uncertain terms
what we needed for our performance. We are a simple band, with no
quirks or gimmicks save one: a giant bat with a 40-foot wingspan that
vomits blood all over the audience at the end of our show. I told Carl
that while we would assemble the bat and control it through a remote,
Mike's would have to be responsible for all of the wiring necessary to
suspend our horrific pet from the pub's beer-soaked rafters.

Carl said no, and it marked the beginning of the end of the end of
Sockhop Babykill Redux.

I can't fully blame the audience (which was filled, by the way, with
automatons who could never, ever understand what we were trying to
accomplish even if we dangled it in front of them like the dollar bills
they so feverishly chase all their short, painful lives); we were lost
out there. Our three-song set felt like it went on for eons. &quot;Your Head
Is in My Lap (But Then It Rolled Off),&quot; which was supposed to be our
explosive opener, came off weaker than it ever had in our rehearsals.
&quot;A Toast to Tomorrow's Dead&quot; didn't go much better, and by the end of
&quot;Tasty Giblets of a Disabled Aunt,&quot; we shared the audience's desire to
have us off the stage as soon as possible.

We convened in the parking lot afterward, trying to regroup. Festering
Axe Wound was the first to speak.

&quot;I have an announcement,&quot; she said. &quot;I am no longer Festering Axe
Wound. I am now Gaping Axe Wound, for the scars of this day have opened
a breach in my soul large enough to admit all the ghosts of forgotten
promises past.&quot;

And that's when it hit me: Gaping Axe Wound can really be a drama queen
sometimes.

There was little to say after that. The harsh inevitability of the
moment hovered above us like our furry protector, who lay disassembled
in my mom's van on the other side of town, should have. Sockhop
Babykill Redux was no more. Deathblow and Gaping Axe Wound were no
more. Northeast Richmond, starved for truth, justice, and dignity,
would have to wait for another band of heroes to shake it from its
prolonged, complacent slumber.
