That rocks!

It's been a while since I've had any PBR; the last time was lunch with
a coworker at a former employer about 15 years ago. Other than that,
the only time I've had PBR was prior to elementary school.

Keep an eye up Friday; I'm flying back to &lt;gasp&gt; Orlando, so I'll
probably be over your area about 2pm. :-)

Again, thanks for the PBR can-car, that rocks! I wonder if the guy
ever gets pulled for violating the open container law?

Interesting, although unfortunately this is not a pleasure trip. :-/
Granted, when I went out on the road at the beginning of last year,
the place where I spent most of my time (3 of the 8 weeks) was in
Orlando. It wasn't a pleasurable trip then, either. :-) While the
location in Orlando I'll be visiting was the most problematic location
from my prior visit, the purpose of this visit is much different, and
I now serve in a greater capacity, so it should be smooth sailing. As
I've already plotted my routes, I am most pleased to say that I won't
be spending any time on the lovely interstates Orlando has to offer.
:-)

I remember the name New Smyrna Beach during my last trip to hades, er,
Orlando, but I didn't make the connection to the PBR car.

&quot;Hey - necromancer is a criminal coddler. BTW the article
says 4X and then it says the BAC was .187 which doesn't
make much sense.  Not that it matters.  Drunk drivers who
kill should get life wo parole.&quot;
