HOWEDY Todd,

WELCOME BAAAACK!

Like the #Pi:

&quot;Only two things are infinite, the Universe and human stupidity,
and I'm not sure about the former.&quot; --Albert Einstein.

&quot;Progress, far from consisting in change, depends
on retentiveness when experience is not retained,
as among savages, infancy is perpetual.

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned
to repeat it....This is the condition of children and
barbarians, in whom instinct has learned nothing
from experience,&quot; George Santayana (1863-1952),

Subject: Puppy Wizard's Wits End Training Method

http://www.freewebs.com/thesimplyamazingpuppy
wizard/777witsendmanual.htm

I have studied canine behavior and dog
training for years. I have a huge library
that covers every system of training.

The Puppy Wizard's (Jerry Howe's) Wits'
End Training Method is by far the most
scientific, the most advanced, the kindest,
the quickest and the most effective training
method yet discovered.

It is not an assortment of training tips
and tricks; it is a logically consistent
system. Every behavior problem and every
obedience skill is treated in the same
logically consistent manner.

Please study his manual carefully. Please
endeavor to understand the basis of his
system and please follow his directions
exactly. His manual is a masterpiece. It
is dense with theory, with explanation,
with detailed descriptions about why
behavior problems occur and how their
solution should be approached.

One should not pick and choose from among
his methods based upon what you personally
like or dislike. His is not a bag of tricks
but a complete and integrated system for
not only training a dog but for raising a
loving companion.

When I once said to Jerry that his system
creates for you the dog of your dreams,
his response was that it produces for your
dog the owner of his dreams.

You see, Jerry has discovered that if
you are gentle with your dog then he
will be gentle with you, if you praise
your dog every time he looks at you,
then you will become the center of your
dogs world, if you use Jerry's sound
distraction with praise, then it takes
just minutes-sometimes merely seconds-to
train your dog to not misbehave (even in
your absence) (Just 15 seconds this morning
to train my 10 week old puppy to lie quietly
and let me clip his nails).

Using Jerry's scientific method (sound
distraction / praise / alteration /
variation) it takes just minutes to train
you dog to respond to your commands.

What a pleasure it was for me to see my
6 week old puppy running as fast has his
wobbly little legs would carry him in
response to my recall command-and he
comes running every time I call no matter
where we are or what he is doing.

At ten weeks old now, my puppy never
strains upon his leash thanks to Jerry's
hot &amp; cold exercises and his Family Pack
Leadership exercises.

Jerry has discovered that if you scold
your dog, if you scream at him, if you
intimidate him, if you hurt him, if you
force him then his natural response is
to oppose you.

Is Jerry a nut?

It doesn't make any difference to me whether
he is or not. It is a logical fallacy to judge
a person's ideas based upon their personality.
As far as dogs are concerned, Jerry wears his
heart upon his sleeve. It touches him deeply
when he hears of trainers forcing, intimidating,
scolding or hurting dogs.

More than that, he knows  that force is
not effective and that it will certainly
lead to behavior problems; sometime
problems so severe that people put their
dogs down because of those problems.

I believe that it is natural for humans
to want to control their dog by force.
Jerry knows this too. We have all been
at our wits' end, haven't we?

Dogs have a natural tendency to mimic. In
scientific literature it is referred to
allelomimetic behavior. Dogs respond in
like kind to force; they respond in like
kind to praise.

Don't bribe your dog with treats; give him
what he wants most-your kind attention. Give
him your praise.

You will be astonished at how your dog 's
anxiety will dissipate and how their behavior
problems will dissipate along with their anxiety.

Treat Jerry Howe's (The Puppy Wizard) Wits'
End Training Method as a scientific principle
just as you would the law of gravity and you
will have astounding success.

Dog behavior is just as scientific as is gravity.

If you follow Jerry's puppy rules you will get
a sweet little Magwai; if you don't you will
surely get a little gremlin (anyone see The
Gremlins?).

Subject: The Amazing Jerry's take on psychobabble
Date: Fri, 29 Jul 2005 12:13:44 -0400

You might improve the learning of folk who actually
live with and train dogs to do useful things if you
excluded everyone who uses psychobabble from your lists.

I recommend to all of you who wish to taste the flavor
of sensible animal behaviorists to read THE MISBEHAVIOR
OF ORGANISMS, Breland and Breland.

This married pair of psychologists began the long trail
of highly trained animals who are symbolized by Shamu
eating a mackrel from a girl's hand instead of eating
the much more tasty pretty girl who is exactly the size
of the natural food of killer whales, seals.  Yum!

The essay, by the way, is a chapter in B.F. Skinner's
summing up book, CUMULATIVE RECORD.  They include a
sentence which more or less says, &quot;unless you understand
the personal history of the particular animal, and the
history of this animal's species and group, the developmental
history of the animal, you cannot effectively train the animal.

Pigs root and hen's scratch, if you try to train hens without
scratching or pigs without scratching or pigeons without pecking,
you aren't going to have much success.

A conditional reflex is one which is learned, the original
primitive reflex occurs no matter what the history of the
animal, and is hard wired.  If you train the animal to respond,
say by ringing a bell immediately before turning on a bright
light, then you've taught the animal and made his native reflex
of pupil constriction conditional upon the ringing of a bell.

Thorndyke added some terminology to this kind of training
and insisted that when you train the animal to make gross
motor responses that this learning is &quot;instrumental&quot;, the
animal takes action and uses an instrument.

The Russian word translated as &quot;conditional&quot; in all other
contexts was mistranslated by Pavlov's American translator,
Horsley Gannt, as &quot;conditioned&quot; and so American psychology
went haring after phantasmagora.

The major theorists for the development of the language of
operant conditioning are Edward Thorndike, John Watson, and
B. F. Skinner. Their approach to behaviorism played a major
role in the development of American psychology.

They proposed that learning is the result of the application
of consequences; that is, learners begin to connect certain
responses with certain stimuli. This connection causes the
probability of the response to change (i.e., learning occurs.)

Thorndike labeled this type of learning instrumental. Using
consequences, he taught kittens to manipulate a latch (e.g.,
an instrument). Skinner renamed instrumental as &quot;operant&quot;
because in this learning, one is &quot;operating&quot; on, and is
influenced by, the environment. Where classical conditioning
illustrates S--&gt;R learning, operant conditioning is often
viewed as R--&gt;S learning since it is the consequence that
follows the response that influences whether the response
is likely or unlikely to occur again.

It is through operant conditioning that
voluntary responses are learned.

One should note that Russian Psychology did very well
without the operant language, and only pettifogging
university professors ought to worry about what kind
of label we attach to the learning.  Pfui!

Even Skinner understood this!

And please note if you saw the original movie, THE
MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, you saw a Chinese psychologist
who was based on Andrew Salter, CONDITIONED REFLEX
THERAPY.

Alas, Salter didn't have a Ph.D., but he basically rescued
us from the long Freudian nightmare and returned psychotherapy
to a scientific basis.  Alas, the 2nd movie didn't even cite
Salter as a source.  &quot;...all the highest nervous activity, as
it manifests itself in the conditional reflex, consists of a
continual change of these three fundamental processes --
excitation, inhibition and disinhibition.&quot;  Ivan P. Pavlov

From Time Magazine  August 5, 1974
The Rev. George von Hilsheimer, 39, a self-styled minister in the Free
Religious Association, is fascinated by psychiatry. Though he has no degrees
in the subject, he likes to talk about such &quot;therapies&quot; as electrosleep,
vivid confrontation, megavitamins and hypode-sensitization. What is
noteworthy about Von Hilsheimer, however, is that he has been able to try
out these techniques, and others as well, during his nine years as
superintendent of the Green Valley School for emotionally disturbed and
delinquent children in Orange City, Fla.

If a child misbehaved, for example, Von Hilsheimer would sometimes gather
the students together to declare him &quot;morally dead&quot;; then, concocting his
own version of reality therapy (which denies the importance of past traumas
and encourages a patient to cope outright with his current dilemma), Von
Hilsheimer and the students would force the youth to dig himself a grave and
lie in it overnight. &quot;I think it is a beautiful symbolic thing for the kids
to go through,&quot; he explained. &quot;It's a way of forcing them to look at
themselves.&quot; At other times he would shackle the child, jolt him with an
electroshock machine dubbed a &quot;lalapalooza,&quot; or shut him up in a storehouse.
All this came to light last week at hearings conducted by the Senate's
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Senators are probing a federal
medical-insurance program called CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services), the benefits of which Include payment
for the care of emotionally disturbed children of military personnel in 486
schools and psychiatric centers round the country. Senate investigators
claim that CHAMPUS administrators do not properly check out facilities
before handing over money. Green Valley, they point out, has received $1.2
million from the Government over a three-year period to perpetrate outrages
that Committee Chairman Henry Jackson called worthy of &quot;Hitler, Use Koch and
Buchenwald.&quot;

In 1973, Florida investigators testified, the school was raided by state
officials; among other brutalizing instruments, they found shackles and a
brown leather whip. One nurse said she had treated numerous bruises from
chains. Von Hilsheimer told TIME Correspondent Joe Kane that his young
charges were &quot;miserable, hateful, violent bastards.&quot; The school's former
headmaster, Ronald E. Nowicki, could also be violent. In a fit of anger he
punched a female student so hard that he ruptured her eardrums.

Von Hilsheimer insists that he is being persecuted. In response to his
critics, he claims that 86% of his students go on to live normal lives in
the outside world, though he has done no follow-up studies. He is also proud
of the fact that there was &quot;only one&quot; suicide at his school. In 1968 a
disturbed boy named Michael Waker, 18, killed himself with a pistol Von
Hilsheimer had allowed him to purchase; later the boy's mother was billed
for the gun. Another boy, depressed to the point of suicide because his
mother had just written telling him how peaceful it was at home without him,
was also handed a gun by Von Hilsheimer, but he decided not to use it.

Green Valley is not the only school to be scrutinized by the committee.
During the hearings, Senate investigators charged that at the University
Center, a residential psychiatric-treatment center in Ann Arbor, Mich, (it
has no connection with the University of Michigan), students who continually
misbehave are locked for days or even months in a &quot;seclusion room.&quot; The
school, which has received more than $1 million in CHAMPUS funds since 1969,
is also accused of being lax about widespread drug use; students who enter
the institution with problems other than drug addiction quickly become
hooked.

Such revelations may improve the situation at Green Valley and the
University Center. But the real problem spreads much further. Senate
investigators feel that there are countless private psychiatric facilities
round the country that exploit their charges and even use government funds
to do so. State and local agencies, which generally have the responsibility
of supervising and licensing these facilities, frequently lack the funds and
manpower to do an adequate job. Until something is done to change this, the
nation will continue to have what Senate investigators call &quot;commercially
operated jails.&quot;

The good &quot;doctor&quot; speaks for himself

You see me here, above, in my incarnation as Father Minister of the
Religious Order of Humanitas, actually a descendant of  The Little Brothers
of the Common Spirit. Green Valley was operated by volunteers, either
members of the Order, or short timers Volunteers who came and went. In 1963
we were all paid $2.50 a week plus room and board and essential goods and
services.

For some improvident escaping hippies, it was actually a better deal  than
their life in the real world. At least they got their dental work done!
$2.50 a week is not a typo, in 1964 we raised it to $5.00, and in 1969 to
$7.50

When I was fairly young, about 14 or so, my Aunt Elizabeth put a copy of IN
HIS STEPS: WHAT WOULD JESUS DO? in my hand and wrecked my life.

If you ask that question and take the answers seriously,  you live very
differently from most folk. When I  was 20 and married to Joan,  A  lady at
the 1st Unitarian Church in Miami told me about A.S. Neill and his school,
Summerhill.  Her talk about the school filled my head with dreams. We
actually almost started the school in Miami. But I went to school at the U
of Chicago, took a wonderful job at the Ethical Society in St Louis, from
which I was drafted and spent two years in involuntary servitude,  most of
it at the 513th Military Intelligence Group in Oberurselam Taunus in
Germany.

When I was in England on leave I found a copy of  THAT DREADFUL SCHOOL. Wow!
I was recovering from two years in the Army and a year working for the
American Humanist Association (I would carry copies of Neill's books like
HEARTS NOT HEADS IN THE SCHOOL; and sell them at meetings). I was having the
worst year of my life, living in the Lower East Side, when Harold Hart
published SUMMERHILL: A RADICAL APPROACH TO CHILD REARING, and he had a
quote from me on the jacket. Hart, who had never published a regular trade
book, had a fabulous success.

It took me a little while to get organized,  I spent a year as a Unitarian
minister in Florida, then came back to New York to organize and carry out
People, Inc. and a host of projects all publicized through THE  REALIST
(which published its last issue in 2000). There was a fairly typical
Summerhill Society in New York full of talkers and arguers but Paul Krasner
was paying me $50 a week and kept me going so we started Summerlane, a camp
in North Carolina, which was burned down the first summer.

We actually had a campus in New Jersey, one in North Carolina, one in
Mileses New York, and before the year was out moved Summerlane to Buck Brook
Farm in North Branch, New York. Four campuses in less than 18 months. Whew!
The actor, Orson Bean, paid for a year's tuition for a six year old street
girl in Mileses. That cash up front tuition actually saved us! Later Orson
started a day school in Manhattan. Bob Hartley appeared after a letter I
thought was sheer B.S. &quot; I am a wealthy young man who..&quot; . But he was real
and enabled us not only to survive but to have a pleasant home by buying
Buck Brook Farm and being very generous about the lease. Bob later started
the Heart Consciousness Church at Harbin Hot Springs in California.
See their website- http://www.harbin.org/harbin.htm )

Actually, Bob was such a generous boob that I was the owner of record for
Buck Brook and two other farms,  but finally deeded it all back to him
before we closed our doors. Bob didn't like cold so he bought the old
Episcopal Franciscan Monastery just outside Orange City and we began to run
two campuses. Later we consolidated in Florida and began to run Buck Brook
Farm just as a summer camp.

&gt;&gt; HOWEDY People,

&gt;&gt; Since The Amazing Puppy Wizard ALWAYS gets
&gt;&gt; CONfHOWENDED tryin to suss the psychobabble
&gt;&gt; in behavioral terminology HE asked Dr. Von
&gt;&gt; if he could remember what he was taught in
&gt;&gt; school fifty years ago:

&gt;&gt;       Instrumental / Classical / Operant / Conditioning
&gt;&gt;            CC / OC / IC / -P +P / +R -R / S R / R S
&gt;&gt; From: &quot;George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D.&quot; &lt;drv ... @mindspring.com&gt;
&gt;&gt; Subject: The Amazing Jerry's take on psychobabble
&gt;&gt; Date: Fri, 29 Jul 2005
&gt;&gt;    You might improve the learning of folk who actually
&gt;&gt; live with and train dogs to do useful things if you
&gt;&gt; excluded everyone who uses psychobabble from your lists.

&gt;&gt; I recommend to all of you who wish to taste the flavor
&gt;&gt; of sensible animal behaviorists to read THE MISBEHAVIOR
&gt;&gt; OF ORGANISMS, Breland and Breland.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt;&gt; The Russian word translated as &quot;conditional&quot; in all other
&gt;&gt; contexts was mistranslated by Pavlov's American translator,
&gt;&gt; Horsley Gannt, as &quot;conditioned&quot; and so American psychology
&gt;&gt; went haring after phantasmagora.

&gt;&gt; The major theorists for the development of the language of
&gt;&gt; operant conditioning are Edward Thorndike, John Watson, and
&gt;&gt; B. F. Skinner. Their approach to behaviorism played a major
&gt;&gt; role in the development of American psychology.

&gt;&gt; They proposed that learning is the result of the application
&gt;&gt; of consequences; that is, learners begin to connect certain
&gt;&gt; responses with certain stimuli. This connection causes the
&gt;&gt; probability of the response to change (i.e., learning occurs.)

&gt;&gt; Thorndike labeled this type of learning instrumental. Using
&gt;&gt; consequences, he taught kittens to manipulate a latch (e.g.,
&gt;&gt; an instrument). Skinner renamed instrumental as &quot;operant&quot;
&gt;&gt; because in this learning, one is &quot;operating&quot; on, and is
&gt;&gt; influenced by, the environment. Where classical conditioning
&gt;&gt; illustrates S--&gt;R learning, operant conditioning is often
&gt;&gt; viewed as R--&gt;S learning since it is the consequence that
&gt;&gt; follows the response that influences whether the response
&gt;&gt; is likely or unlikely to occur again.

&gt;&gt; It is through operant conditioning that
&gt;&gt; voluntary responses are learned.

&gt;&gt; One should note that Russian Psychology did very well
&gt;&gt; without the operant language, and only pettifogging
&gt;&gt; university professors ought to worry about what kind
&gt;&gt; of label we attach to the learning.  Pfui!

&gt;&gt; Even Skinner understood this!

&gt;&gt; And please note if you saw the original movie, THE
&gt;&gt; MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, you saw a Chinese psychologist
&gt;&gt; who was based on Andrew Salter, CONDITIONED REFLEX THERAPY.

&gt;&gt; Alas, Salter didn't have a Ph.D., but he basically rescued
&gt;&gt; us from the long Freudian nightmare and returned psychotherapy
&gt;&gt; to a scientific basis.  Alas, the 2nd movie didn't even cite
&gt;&gt; Salter as a source.  &quot;...all the highest nervous activity, as
&gt;&gt; it manifests itself in the conditional reflex, consists of a
&gt;&gt; continual change of these three fundamental processes --
&gt;&gt; excitation, inhibition and disinhibition.&quot;  Ivan P. Pavlov

&gt;&gt; What's important is, &quot;does Shamu reliably eat
&gt;&gt; the fish and not the pretty girl?&quot;

http://www.wellnesstherapies.net/biofeedback_history.htm

History of EEG Biofeedback and Uses for ADD/ADHD and Other
Problems Phil Bate, Ph.D., Biofeedback Home Training Inc.

The ElectroEncephaloGraph (EEG) was called a &quot;quack machine&quot; when it
was first introduced. Today, most MD offices have one, as it's very
useful in finding epilepsy, brain tumors, and in determining brain
death. However, few MD's use it for biofeedback training, and even
fewer are knowledgeable about this usage.

There are several different frequency &quot;bands&quot; of very small voltages
(measured in millionths of a volt) emanating from the brain. Each band
is somewhat different from the other, depending on the state of mind
of the subject. Because of individuality, these bands overlap to some
extent, and the definitions of them vary somewhat. These bands are
named by Greek letters.

These are as follows:

Delta waves(0-3 Hz) are characterized by deep dreamless unmoving
sleep.

Theta waves (4-7 Hz) are sometimes used to train subjects towards
hypnotic and meditation trances. It has also been used for healing
purposes.
Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are produced when in a very relaxed state of
mind. It is probably most recognized as that state reached while
watching TV. For many years, this area was a focus of meditation and
hypnotic training.

Beta waves (12-38 Hz) means that the brain is active. It is actually
thinking. There are a few very important subdivisions of Beta. Low
Beta, (usually considered as 12-16 Hz) is characterized by good steady
thinking. This band is now often called SMR (SensiMotor Response). The
specific frequency band of 12-14 Hz is the focus of ADD/ADHD training,
since low incidence of waves in this region is a symptom of ADD/ADHD
(and many other emotional diseases that are helped or eliminated by
biofeedback training in this range). It has been found in a few
studies that biofeedback training above this range (higher beta) can
sometimes increase symptoms of ADD/ADHD. While studies are somewhat
controversial, the system we use inhibits these frequencies anyway.
There is also a gamma band (above 40 Hz), but it is not of interest to
us in this training.

Barry Sterman, a VA psychologist demonstrated that EEG biofeedback in
the range of 12-14 Hz protected cats from seizures provoked by toxic
chemicals in the late 1960s. Cats not so trained, died quickly. He was
on contract to the US Navy, and unfortunately didn't follow up on his
discovery, although he did publish this finding. He has done some good
research later on this.

Dr D. A. Quirk, a prison psychologist was one of the first to become
interested in this type of EEG biofeedback. He applied the same basic
method of SMR training to 2776 violent criminal prisoners in an
Ontario prison. Any person interested in crime statistics knows that
the recividism rate (criminals repeating the same or similar crimes
and rearrested) is about 70%.

Of these 2776 violent prisoners only 15% were re-arrested. This
compares
to the 70% rate normally found. Obviously, something was changed!

Dr Quirk also treated many cases of ADD/ADHD with this same technique,
and persuaded his good friend, Dr George Von Hilsheimer, to try it as
well. Between them, they treated (successfully) hundreds of cases, and
Dr Von has now limited his practice to just EEG Biofeedback. He treats
depression, irritable bowel syndrome, autism, stroke, brain injury,
and others using the same training. He's the ONLY clinician I know of
that guarantees EEG biofeedback results, and he hasn't had to pay
money back!

Many other researchers have also done many studies on the efficiacy of
EEG biofeedback for ADD/ADHD. Dr Joel Lubar at the University of
Tennessee has been in forefront of this research for over 30 years.
Synopsis of some of these research papers can be seen at Papers

Other researchers have applied the same method used by Dr Quirk to
train private patients with varying emotional problems, and obtained
similar results. Several of these professionals have now shown that
EEG biofeedback training that increases the SMR area definitely
changes the ADD/ADHD child towards the norm. At this point, well over
200,000 persons previously diagnosed as either ADD or ADHD, are
completely off dangerous drugs and are now able to sit still in a
classroom, concentrate, and learn. Since most such kids are actually
higher in IQ than average, we are &quot;wasting&quot; too much of our future
brainpower by treating them with drugs!

At this point in time, hundreds of other psychologists (and other
clinicians) have trained thousands of youngsters to pay attention and
sit calmly and productively in class.

This same method is the basis of the ADD Biofeedback Home Training
System. It is proven to work, can cause no harm, and has no adverse
side effects as do drugs. Did you know that no state as of this
writing even requires licensing to perform biofeedback training? It's
that safe. The above is a very condensed version of biofeedback
history. There's much more scientific data and many ponderous papers
(some of them are even readable). Take a look at the Proof page for
lots of info on research papers.

Here's more MEGA-QUACKERY!:

Page 1
The Health Revolution by Philip Bate PhD

There's a revolution going on in Healthcare. Patients don't
trust their doctors andhospitals, and are looking more and
more at &quot;unconventional&quot;, &quot;alternate&quot;, or&quot;holistic&quot; therapies
that often actually work better than drugs and conventional
medicine.

This book describes some of these &quot;revolutionary&quot; therapies by
showing successful personal case histories using orthomolecular
(holistic) therapies for emotional and physical problems.

The author, a successful behaviorist psychologist, had to convert
his conventional thinking, and actively pursue and study many
therapies that he had previously considered &quot;quackery.

&quot;Schizophrenia, depression, hyperactivity/behavior problems in
children, chronicheadaches, phobias, sex /marriage problems,
PMS, Herpes, Diabetes, obesity/ƒweightcontrol, gout, allergies,
and many other physical and emotional problems can be either
cured or vastly helped by the ortho-molecular therapies outlined
in this book. Thetherapies are outlined so that anyone can use them.

No prescriptions are needed.

DEDICATION

This book is dedicated to all the good men that have worked to
advance medical science in spite of all the obstacles put in their
way. They have all too often been called &quot;quacks&quot; by their
contemporaries. I am proud to be associated with all of them,
and be called quack by lesser men.

In particular, I want to thank the ones who havehelped me the most.
Dr. George Von Hilsheimer who has taught me more about health
than I sometimes wanted to know. A genius, and a good friend in
the true sense.

Dr Abram Hoffer, a pioneer of schizophrenia megavitamin therapy.
He proved it waseffective in 1965. I've learned a lot from him.

Dr. Carl Pfeiffer who started us thinking about mineral imbalance
and toxicity effectson the human brain. Carl was unfailingly helpful,
and gave freely of his time to adviseand guide me. I miss him.

Dr Marshall Mandell who named &quot;brain allergy&quot; as a major cause
for all mental as well as physical problems. A giant in allergy
research.

Dr. Linus Pauling, our only two time Nobel Prize winner, who has
probably donemore than anyone to advance nutritional thinking,
yet who has been abused and calleda &quot;quack&quot; more than most.
I miss him as well.

Dr. Sol Klotz who, with an open mind, allowed two &quot;quack&quot;
psychologists to work inhis clinic under his aegis. He taught
Dr. Von and me a lot about allergy, and in turn, we  taught
him a little about the effects of allergy/sensitivity on the brain.

----------------------------------------------------

There are many more, too numerous to mention, who wrote
books, articles, andprofessional papers that helped me to
learn this &quot;new&quot; science. Some of those books,easily readable
and interesting to laymen, are listed in the bibliography. For
those who are interested in this new and exciting science,
those will lead to others. I followed that trail for many years,
and found it fascinating in the wealth of excellent science
that is largely unknown to the medical community and to the
populace at large.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the healthcare revolution. By reading this book,
you've joined therevolution, and you won't be as satisfied
with &quot;medical science&quot; and present health care methods as
you may have been in the past. Along the way, you'll also
learna lot about your own (and others) health and how to
improve it in many ways thatyour medical doctor didn't learn
in medical school - more's the pity.

Why a revolution? Any revolution starts because the people
involved simply get fedup with the status quo, and the only
way to change it is to revolt. Healthcare is no different.

The people in these United States are fed up with the present
healthcare system, and we're slowly changing it. It's not a
bloodless revolution because too many people are dying from
lack of knowledge on the part of physicians.

President Clinton tried to change it dramatically for the
better (it couldn't be much worse), and failed because of
political lobbies. We, the public, can change it, but it
will take time.

Medicine is in a horrible state in the US. We spend twice as
much as any other nation on our health industry - over 12% of
our gross national product. We are the most technologically
advanced nation in the world. Our doctors make more money
than any others, yet they know less about nutrition and
alternate health care than European doctors.

They are actually educationally handicapped.

Given this technological superiority, how is that we are 12th
in health statistics? Every other major civilized nation,
including all those with socialized medicine, is ahead of us.
Including Russia! (They may not have won the space race, or
the Cold War, but they're ahead of us in the health race).

How did we come to this sorry pass?

One part of the answer is that we are a &quot;drugtaking&quot; society.
We have come to expect our doctors (aided and abetted by
the drug industry) to give us a magic pill for everything. That's
our fault - not the doctors. Madison Avenue drug advertising
hasn't helped.

Perhaps the biggest factor of all - medical doctors simply
have no learned knowledge of the nutritional needs of humans
other than a very superficial one. They spend thousands of
hours in medical school studying pharmacology and almost no
time on vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional needs.

Would you ask your doctor about your car engine? Of course not!
He isn't trained in car engines. So why even ask your medical
doctor about vitamins, minerals, and nutrition.

The odds are that what he does &quot;know&quot; is largely wrong.

------------------------------------------

Page 4

This situation is made worse by the complete dependence on
drug advertising by all US medical journals. No editor of
such dares to print an article or professional paper that
might even suggest that nutrition may be better than drugs.

Advertisers would stop advertising, and he'd be fired. Thus,
physicians can't learn about the basics of nutrition in medical
school, and their primary source of continuing education is
biased against their learning anything positive about it after
graduation!

In fact, medical journals have often published so-called
research on vitamins and minerals that is completely false
and misleading. You may have heard that excess vitamins
are dangerous. That can be true under certain very limited
circumstances, but excess water can be dangerous.

Maybe you've heard that vitamin C can cause kidney stones.
This is a favorite of mine, because vitamin C never caused
any stones - it actually cures kidney stones.

Many European medical journals aren't dominated by drug
interests, and as a result, papers and articles about
nutrition are seen there. Such journals keep those doctors
years ahead of the US doctors. Also, in most parts of Europe,
medical doctors are at least knowledgeable about homeopathy,
and many, if not most, use these therapies to advantage in
their practiceas well as drugs.

In the US, homeopathy is lumped with chiropractic and
acupuncture, and still derided as quackery by many physicians.

Drugs only attack symptoms. They don't solve the actual
cause(s) of the problem.Taking an aspirin for a headache
suppresses that headache, but it doesn't stop a person
from getting another headache from the same problem later.

No one ever got aheadache from a shortage of salicylic acid
(aspirin). And there are no drugs without some side effects.
Over a thousand persons per year die from aspirin side effects.

Drugs are life-savers when used correctly, but in current healthcare,
they are vastlyoverused, particularly antibiotics that cause other
problems.Another major factor - our modern
diet is deficient in many of the nutrients neededfor good
health.

We are what we eat.

And we aren't eating as we (the human race) evolved eating.
Food from the supermarket simply can't supply good nutrition
needed today! Vegetables and fruits are picked green and
ripened artificially to save moneyon less spoilage. In addition,
harmful pesticides have been used on much of our produce,
and the very soil it comes from is often lacking in minerals
that are needed for good health. If it's not in the soil, it isn't
in the food!

Just compare that lump of red plastic called a tomato in the
supermarket to a real one from a roadside stand that was grown
right and allowed to ripen naturally. A real
