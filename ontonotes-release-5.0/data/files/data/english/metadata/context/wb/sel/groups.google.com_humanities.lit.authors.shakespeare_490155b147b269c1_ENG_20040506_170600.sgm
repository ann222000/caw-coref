NEUROSCIENCE Freud Returns

&lt;&lt;Neuroscientists are finding that their biological descriptions of the
brain may fit together best when integrated by psychological theories Freud
sketched a century ago&gt;&gt;

By Mark Solms

&lt;&lt;For the first half of the 1900s, he ideas of Sigmund Freud dominated
explanations of how the human mind works. His basic proposition was that our
motivations remain largely hidden in our unconscious minds. Moreover, they
are actively withheld from consciousness by a repressive force. The
executive apparatus of the mind (the ego) rejects any unconscious drives
(the id) that might prompt behavior that would be incompatible with our
civilized conception of ourselves. This repression is necessary because the
drives express themselves in unconstrained passions, childish fantasies, and
sexual and aggressive urges.

Mental illness, Freud said until his death in 1939, results when repression
fails. Phobias, panic attacks and obsessions are caused by intrusions of the
hidden drives into voluntary behavior. The aim of psychotherapy, then, was
to trace neurotic symptoms back to their unconscious roots and expose these
roots to mature, rational judgment, thereby depriving them of their
compulsive power....&gt;&gt;

Freud's unpublished work would actually appear much more like's Art's work.
He frankly acknowledged that there were many things that emerged in the
course of his studies which could not be admitted in his researches, it was
hard enough to mention even sex as motivator.

Masonic conspiracies or intrigues? The trouble with most Rosicrucians,
certainly of the AMORC tribe, opined my friend, is that they identify
something truly interesting without understanding it in the least.

That is a distinction.

Freud himself repressed the feminine, and pathologically pursued a cult of
rationalisation of all things. Mental illness is the cult of attempting to
perform with the intellect what should be performed by, for example, the
emotions. It is not as much as if the intellect has gone wrong, but that it
supplants other functions of consciousness - and that is the 'repression'
which Freud himself did not escape.

It is the subject of who 'rides the boar' in Shakespeare.

--------------------------------------------------------
Le Disciple de Verre
--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;El Licenciado Vidriera (The Glass Scholar). . . is about a particularly
intelligent young man named Tomás Rodaja who leaves his hometown at an early
age to seek an education in the city. On his way to his new life, he becomes
friends with some soldiers who invite him to join them in their conquests.
He tags along with them for a while, but determines that education is what
he truly seeks. He goes to school in Salamanca and soon becomes very popular
among his peers for his prodigious intellect and all around amicable
demeanor.

Apparently the boy is handsome as well, as a young woman falls deeply in
love with him. Unfortunately for her, Tomás is more interested in his books
than in her. Unfortunately for him, her infatuation with him leads her to
consult a shady Moorish woman and gets her hands on some variety of medieval
date rape drug. Well, the drug not only does not work, but it fries Tomás so
badly that he becomes convinced that he's made of glass and he won't let
anybody near him for fear of breaking.

Tomás makes himself famous once again, but this time it's for dressing up
like Brian David &quot;Emmanuel&quot; Mitchell and cautiously skulking around town
trying not to break. The poor guy still has his intellect, but the problem
is that he's lost his reserve. His quick mind churns out a steady stream of
witty Jesse Ventura-isms that knock at the Catholic church, academia, the
Spanish caste system and just about anything else worthy of scorn. He's
particularly hard on the poets and scholars, saying that they can say
anything they want as long as they support one another's 'brilliance' and
team up against their critics' 'ignorance.'

His friends in Salamanca protect him as much as they can, but his fame soon
spreads abroad and an emissary from Castilla approaches him offering a
position in the court in Castilla. He's packed into a huge crate full of hay
and shipped off to his new position. His curious behavior soon attracts
flocks of Castillians that follow him around town asking him his opinion on
things, knowing that they'll get a quick, harsh and intelligent response.
Much like the conflict in Don Quixote, there are some people mindful of
Tomás' dignity and after a few months of his spectacle, a priest is able to
attend to Tomás and cure him of his insanity.

Once cured, he goes back to Salamanca, gets his degree and returns to
Castilla as a real lawyer in the court, however his career doesn't take off
quite as quickly as it had before. His acumen is intact, but with it is his
regained deliberation and consideration. In short, he's still smart, but
he's uninteresting. His failure to draw attention leads to the loss of his
sustenance, and he's forced to forgo his credentials and team up with his
old soldier friends for some 'real' work.&gt;&gt;

Ho Ho. Freud supressed it himself for what might be termed 'market reasons.'
Of his five acolytes, each of them took some aspect of this occulted
research and developed it. There are even those who think the philosophic
nature is much more pertinent to the life of our times than its clinical
aspect.

Certainly Laurens van der Post made this point concerning Jung's work - not
incidentally, Jung was quite a fan of the bard.

You are offering a back-handed compliment, David. He is not stuck-up? :)

A scruple of seriousness: vdPost &amp; Jung did not as much carp about using the
intellect pro se, but rather how it was employed, and they both distrusted
its European orientation, and Freud's fixation with intellect which they
thought neurotic.

I don't know if you know the 3-party conversation concerning the fire-making
anecdote? I'll try to find it since it is a good illustration to the limit
of intellectual investigation.

Anyone can find themselves riding the boar, seemingly from out of nowhere.
Lear's catalytic moment was his rejection of Cordelia, and acceptance of her
two false sisters. In effect he suppressed the true femininity in all 3 of
them, preferring a falsity acceptable to his intellectual ego. That's a
little dire, no?

In my own opinion, you are probably correct. I think who we are

I know very few things about Jung. I know that he departed from Freud

more adapted to the German nation. I know that he is preferred by
some artists (at least in the U.S. and Canada), because he does not,
as Freud supposedly does, trace everything back to sex: you can read
Jung in mixed company. I know that he held to the idea that we have a
racial (biologically inherited) memory, which finds expression in
myth. I know that it has been argued that his ideas helped lead to
Nazism. It's also been said that Freud's theories were flawed because
his observations were solely of the mentally ill, and because he
studied only a single society (the German-speaking leisure class),
without seeming to be aware that his observations might be
culture-bound. Jung's culturally self-conscious approach, perhaps,
avoids these problems.

I think he died in the mid 1990s? Annie Besant dragged him around telling

that and settle into a psychological sort of east-west philosophy. He had an
establishment in Sussex. Either Brockwood or Brockhurst. I went once, he was
quite amusing.

He did actually spend rather a lot of time in Africa, aboriginal africa, in
cultures completely out of sight to most of the modern world. The man who
wrote his non-clinical biography said that he was much more interested in
this work and in other aspects of philosophy than in the clinical work we
normally associate with Jung.

In fact, that the non-clinical work was far more import to the life of our
times. I would not blame you for not knowing this, since it is a very
underwritten subject. There is a title Jung and the Life of our Times, by
Col. Sir Laurens van der Post.

vdPost himself is a South African by birth. I met him in Scotland with Sir
Ian Player and Sir George T. They were quite amusing and entertained us
Europeans with an extended conversation in Bushman, a series of palate
clicks and whistles, a strange electric conversation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reason, pursued to its logical conclusion, *is* perfectly capable
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discovering the fact that reason alone is insufficient.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Krishnamurti: &quot;when reason, of itself, realises it is insufficient...&quot;

&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with Krishnamurti. Does the name refer to a
&gt;&gt; traditional text, or to a specific modern writer?

(quote)

The core of Krishnamurti's teaching is contained in the statement
he made in 1929 when he said: 'Truth is a pathless land'. Man cannot
come to it through any organisation, through any creed, through any
dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophic knowledge or
psychological technique. He has to find it through the mirror of
relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own
mind . . . Statement by Krishnamurti in 1981.

Jiddu Krishnamurti was born on 11th May 1895 in Madanapalle, a town
in south India, the eighth child in a middle-class family. At an early
age he was adopted by Annie Besant, then the President of the
Theosophical Society, with its headquarters in Madras. She took
Krishnamurti and his brother Nitya to England where she had them
educated privately.

On Krishnamurti's return to India while still in his teens,
Theosophists proclaimed him to be the world teacher whose coming they
had been awaiting. They built a large and rich order round him, with
many thousands of followers, but in 1929 Krishnamurti disbanded the
organisation, returned the estates and monies that had been given to
him and declared that his only purpose was to set human beings
unconditionally free from psychological limitations. From that time he
travelled throughout most parts of the world almost ceaselessly
speaking to large numbers of people, until his death on 17th February
1986.

Krishnamurti is regarded globally as one of the greatest religious
teachers of all time. He did not expound any philosophy or religion,
but spoke of the everyday matters that concern all human beings—the
problems of living in modern society with violence and corruption, the
individual's search for meaning, security and happiness; and our need
to free ourselves from the inner burdens of fear, anger, hurt and
sorrow. He talked of the need to have a deeply meditative and
religious quality in our daily life.

Krishnamurti belonged to no religion, sect or country, nor did he
subscribe to any school of political or ideological thought. Instead,
he stated that these are the very factors that divide us from one
another and bring about personal and social conflict and ultimately
war. His talks and discussions were not based on any authority of
tradition or academic knowledge, but arose out of his own insights
into the human mind and his own relation with the sacred. He
consistently communicated a sense of freshness and directness with his
audiences, although his message remained basically unchanged over the
years.

Krishnamurti is unique in having left authentic written and
recorded materials of his public talks and discussions and his
conversations with scientists, philosophers, educators, children,
businessmen and &quot;ordinary&quot; people. Many of these have appeared in
books and on audio and videotapes and discs. His teachings are best
approached directly and not through any interpreters or commentators.

I think the traditional view is that perspectives of individuals

departure explicable by cultural, psychological, or possibly more

&quot;Truth&quot; to perceive well or poorly, so every communication (even what
would be taken as traditionally &quot;true&quot;) is a mere expression of
probably unconscious urges. It's not evident what such a person would
think education might be for. Presumably, it all comes down to
politics, eventually: children should be taught what the
powers-that-be believe they should know. (I don't know what happens
to the positions taken by those who believe this, many of whom seemed
simply to have allied themselves with the most convenient socialist

&lt;Jung, I think?&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He did actually spend rather a lot of time in Africa, aboriginal africa, in
&gt; cultures completely out of sight to most of the modern world. The man who
&gt; wrote his non-clinical biography said that he was much more interested in
&gt; this work and in other aspects of philosophy than in the clinical work we
&gt; normally associate with Jung.

&gt; In fact, that the non-clinical work was far more import to the life of our
&gt; times. I would not blame you for not knowing this, since it is a very
&gt; underwritten subject. There is a title Jung and the Life of our Times, by
&gt; Col. Sir Laurens van der Post.

&gt; vdPost himself is a South African by birth. I met him in Scotland with Sir
&gt; Ian Player and Sir George T. They were quite amusing and entertained us
&gt; Europeans with an extended conversation in Bushman, a series of palate
&gt; clicks and whistles, a strange electric conversation.

"/>

The topic of how the successors to the initiator of a new science come
to represent that science is an intriguing one in its own right, but
I'm afraid a fair amount of what I do know about Jung may be out of an
Anthony Burgess novel! In general, I know more about British and
French thinkers than about German. Sartre and Russell, but not
Husserl and Heidegger. Mill, but not (except for bits and pieces)
Hegel. (Exceptions being those who, like Wittgenstein, are either
exemplary Jewish figures, or wrote sometimes in English, or both.)
I'm more likely to come at anthropology from Malinowski, Mead, Boas,
and Benedict (of whom I unfortunately have only a vague memory), and
would have thought that the gentlemanly amateur tradition, based
largely on a youthful reading of Grimm and similar writers, had
already been supplanted by the modern social sciences.

May I ask, is that &quot;Still Life&quot; or one of the short stories? I think
I've read all of Byatt's novels, but not all her short stories, and

Something I find interesting about Gauguin is that he started by
creating a private symbolism for himself to work with, and later
returned to Paris (after several years working apart from other
artists, which might also have something to do with it) to find nobody
understood his work. In the intervening time he had become fascinated
with the primitive Tahitian culture and with the destruction it had
suffered at the hands of Europeans in quite a short time, and
attempted to re-represent it, in a way, in his paintings. The reason
Gauguin and his circle had so much trouble finding a way to express
their thoughts in symbols, one might argue, was that they had rejected
the culture in which they'd been raised, as so many did in Europe at
that time.

Bianca, perhaps you remember this segment from Still Life? and Byatt's text
commentary:-

&quot;My Dear Theo, I wrote to you already early this morning; then I went
away to go on with a picture of a garden in the sunshine. Then I brought it
back and went out again with a blank canvas, and that also is finished. And
now I write to you again.
Because I have never had such a chance, nature here being so
/extraordinarily/ beautiful. Everywhere and all over the vault of heaven is
a marvelous blue, and the sun sheds a radiance of pale sulpher, and it is
soft and lovely as the combination of heavenly blues and yellows in a Van
der Meer of Delft [sic]. I cannot paint it as beautifully as that, but it
absorbs me so much that I let myself go, never thinking of a single rule...
Here under a stronger sun, I have found what Pissarro said confirmed,
and also what Gauguin wrote to me, the simplicity, the fading of the colors,
the gravity of great sunlight effects.
You never come near to suspecting it in the north.&quot;

She says: He saw also Dutch things in the French heat, bridges not formally
different from those in Delft and Leyden, colors in the glare that reminded
him primarily of the soft blues and yellows of Vermeer. Also, and
simultaneously, he saw what no one had yet seen, what was his to see.
Sunflowers, cypresses, olives.

Cordially, Phil

Did you have some particular writer in mind? I was trying to describe
a position that (the early, I think) Foucault might have supported,
from the point of view of someone who wished to support tradition.
&quot;Unconscious urges&quot; may have been a little over the top. I suppose
that I may have been in error in trying to understand what Mr. Innes's
paragraph implied, and in choosing words with which I might say
something on the same topic, not to mention in figuring out how to
write it out all in a way that could convey an appropriate point. If
you're _relatively_ familiar with theory, do you think you could post
something like a straightened-out paraphrase of the above, or point
out which words are used inappropriately? It may be that the contrast
I was trying to draw didn't come across clearly.

&gt;&gt; politics, eventually: children should be taught what the
&gt;&gt; powers-that-be believe they should know.

&gt; This is the foundation of modern educational theory, according to Dewey.

"/>

I thought Dewey thought children should be taught what Dewey and other
psychologists thought children ought to know and to be able to do, in
order to participate fully in a democratic society. Exactly the
opposite of their being taught to be good little worker cogs in the
machine.

Sorry, I skipped a step or sentence somewhere. I meant the political
positions most frequently taken by those who, as above, agree with
&quot;postmodernism&quot; and find it important. If there's no truth, there's
nothing to support their decisions to support one political position
rather than another. Yet they often do take a strong political
position, often one devoted to the _obvious_ superiority of socialism
and to the idea that any criticism of left-wing ideology can be
dismissed out of hand. Recent history has fairly decisively proved
them wrong.

&gt;&gt; Something I find interesting about Gauguin is that he started by

nobody

Its a wry Patrick O'Brian joke, spoken ironically by Jack Aubrey, forgotten

People rarely even discuss the plays of Shakespeare here. It is apparently a
more interesting subject to discuss if they were written by Donald Duck.Or a
committee of duck impersonators. Or why those views are obnoxious,
ill-researched, improvident, spurious and above all, antithetical to the
self-evident fact that the plays were written by Mr. Toad. Views on all
sides are fiercely held, and other people, globbed into groups for
convenience of abuse, are almost inconceivably stupid, with the single
exceptions of people who have actually met each other who perforce must
honour some sense of reality, and even mutual human dignity.

It is not unsimilar to the cold war, though it is entirely obscure what
depends on any resolution.

Someone once explaind that the plays would read differently if the author's
identity were known, but couldn't make more of a case of it than that, and I
wonder if the plays would read differently after Dekker's works had been
read. Or if what the author himself read was digested.

Cooool! Don't knock over the SUNSPHERE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SUNSPHERE: 525 HENLEY St.., World's Fair Park, Nochsville

(William Shakespeare was born in a house on HENLEY St.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Shakespeare], at length thy pious fellowes giue
The world thy Workes: thy Workes, by which, out-liue

[T]hy Tombe, thy name must; when that stone is rent,
[A]nd Time dissolues thy Stratford Moniment,
[H]ere we aliue shall view thee still. This Booke,
[W]hen *BRASSE* &amp; *marble* fade, shall make thee looke
-------------------------------------------------------------
The History of Freemasonry - Albert Mackey

&lt;&lt;Enoch constructed underground an edifice consisting of
9 BRICK vaults situated perpendicularly beneath each other.

Fearing that the principles of the arts &amp; sciences
which he had assiduously cultivated would be lost in
that universal deluge of which he bad received a prophetic
vision, Enoch erected above-ground two pillars, one of *marble* ,
to withstand the destructive influences of fire, and one of *BRASS*,
to resist the action of water. On the pillar of BRASS he engraved
the history of the creation, the principles of the arts &amp; sciences,
and the doctrines of Speculative Masonry.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------
And what's inside? An INFORMATION desk.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Milhouse: Wait! How about a fair? Not just a county fair,
not just a Europe fair, but a World's fair
-- the World's Fair in KNOXville, Tennessee.

Bart: Keep reading.

Milhouse: The Hungarians have built a giant motorized Rubik's cube,
and the fair's symbol is the SUNSPHERE,
which sits atop a 266-foot tall steel shaft.

Bart: What's inside?

Milhouse: An INFORMATION desk.

B+N+M: Cooool!

Bart: We got no car!

Martin: We got no money!

Milhouse: And no one knows we're here!

B+Ma+Mi: We're stranded!

Nelson: But on the plus side, I knocked over the SUNSPHERE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Wren's St. Paul's is 366 feet high.

Yes. I suppose so.

In the novel this is amplified and contrasted by the scene on the Camargue
beach, then later by aesthetic theorums encountered at Cambridge, and
Frederica's puzzlement about herself, her own perceptions subdued beneath
all these scenes, and received opinions, their force as promoted by Leavis,
Amis, a snoozing gentleman &lt;g&gt;. Even that earlier daring glimpse across the
bullring and the hissing at Picasso contained both Frederica's own emotional
reaction, but also the Author's explication of it, and her state.

Many of these subdued elements go unresolved until later books. That is my
guess - you will know better Peter by way of your correspondent - but I
think Frederica is not yet acting as a woman, only as a sexual young person
much subject to outside 'behaviors' and culture. The author seemed to need
to deal with the story within Babel Tower, and the dark-side of these
repressions, before her subject could emerge maturely.

She is a particularly interesting writer to read for any Shakespearean

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. This informs your previous point. Perception has nothing to
&gt; do with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason in a causal way, but is necessary in order to communicate a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective of what is seen. In fact, necessary to objectivise
&gt; what is seen!

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the traditional view is that perspectives of individuals
&gt;&gt;&gt; depart more or less widely from the truth, with the degree of
&gt;&gt;&gt; departure explicable by cultural, psychological, or possibly more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;contingent&quot; factors. For postmodernists, however, there is no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Truth&quot; to perceive well or poorly, so every communication (even
&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be taken as traditionally &quot;true&quot;) is a mere expression of
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably unconscious urges.

&gt;&gt; I'm not all that up on theory anymore, but this sounds more like a
mixture
&gt;&gt; of structuralism, postmodernism and Freud.

&gt; Did you have some particular writer in mind? I was trying to describe
&gt; a position that (the early, I think) Foucault might have supported,
&gt; from the point of view of someone who wished to support tradition.
&gt;&quot;Unconscious urges&quot; may have been a little over the top. I suppose
&gt; that I may have been in error in trying to understand what Mr. Innes's
&gt; paragraph implied, and in choosing words with which I might say
&gt; something on the same topic, not to mention in figuring out how to
&gt; write it out all in a way that could convey an appropriate point. If

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not evident what such a person would
&gt;&gt;&gt; think education might be for. Presumably, it all comes down to
&gt;&gt;&gt; politics, eventually: children should be taught what the
&gt;&gt;&gt; powers-that-be believe they should know.

&gt;&gt; This is the foundation of modern educational theory, according to Dewey.

&gt; I thought Dewey thought children should be taught what Dewey and other
&gt; psychologists thought children ought to know and to be able to do, in
&gt; order to participate fully in a democratic society. Exactly the
&gt; opposite of their being taught to be good little worker cogs in the
&gt; machine.

&quot;Every teacher should realize he is a social servant set apart for the
maintenance of the proper social order and the securing of the right social
growth.&quot; John Dewey, 1897

shaped and formed into finished products. . .manufactured like nails, and
the specifications for manufacturing will come from government and

&quot;In our dreams. . .people yield themselves with perfect docility to our
molding hands. The present educational conventions [intellectual and
character education] fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition we
work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try
to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of
learning or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors,
educators, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great
artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians,
statesmen, of whom we have ample supply. The task we set before ourselves is
very simple. . .we will organize children. . .and teach them to do in a
perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect
way.&quot;
Rockefeller Education Board report, 1906

&quot;Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in
prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an
accident but the result of substantial education, which, scientifically
defined, is the subsumption of the individual.&quot;
William Torrey Harris, US Commissioner of Education from 1889 to 1906

&quot;We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a
very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal
education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Something I find interesting about Gauguin is that he started by
&gt;&gt;&gt; creating a private symbolism for himself to work with, and later
&gt;&gt;&gt; returned to Paris (after several years working apart from other
&gt;&gt;&gt; artists, which might also have something to do with it) to find
&gt; nobody
&gt;&gt;&gt; understood his work. In the intervening time he had become
&gt; fascinated
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the primitive Tahitian culture and with the destruction it had
&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered at the hands of Europeans in quite a short time,

&gt;&gt; He certainly contributed his share.

&gt; Yes, but -- eventually -- he felt guilty about it.

&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempted to re-represent it, in a way, in his paintings. The

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gauguin and his circle had so much trouble finding a way to express
&gt;&gt;&gt; their thoughts in symbols, one might argue, was that they had
&gt; rejected
&gt;&gt;&gt; the culture in which they'd been raised, as so many did in Europe

It is a European negative interrogative - perhaps more popular in French and

&quot;Jerusalem&quot; was also the school song of my children here in the states -
there was an emphasise line, 'Bring me my arrows of desire&quot; which is loud,
if not actually shouted.

My own school song was in latin, &quot;Non nobis, Domine&quot;, which we sang
ironically.

Do you remember a very old Beeb prog on Blake, was it called 'Glad Day'?
Tralling through the potteries up north the phrase extends itself very
naturally, and even those modern cooling towers are spooky. But I think
Blake's Satanic Mills phrase was figurative, he heartily detested people
treated as machines. A last great shout before the industrial revolution.

Not a solo shout perhaps, didn't we discuss before Hardy's Tess, and that
disastrous 'new-man' Angel. Dickens noted more the unnecessary squalor and
meaness rather than the fact of the age's manifestation.

Blake described &quot;the schools and universities of Europe&quot; in terms that
might seem most appropriate to factories:

I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep
And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.

I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.

The &quot;dark satanic mills&quot; might be Oxford and Cambridge.

&gt; I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep
&gt; And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
&gt; I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
&gt; Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
&gt; That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
&gt; For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
&gt; Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
&gt; Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.

&gt; I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
&gt; And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
&gt; Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
&gt; In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
&gt; Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
&gt; Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
&gt; Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.

&gt; The &quot;dark satanic mills&quot; might be Oxford and Cambridge.

Very interesting, Terry. Thank you. TR, this shouts ambiguity at me. The
&quot;dark satanic mills&quot; could just as easily mean factories or schools.

That's unfair and untruthful, David. Mr. Innes is fluent in faux-Cornish, as
he demonstrated a couple of years ago on soc.culture.Cornish. He also knows
faux-Russian that rises to the level of chess-Russian, as well you know from
your conversations with him. And his mastery of faux-English is without
peer. Look up his definition of &quot;crapulous&quot; as &quot;shitty language&quot;, or his
claim the term &quot;butt-kissing&quot; describes homosexuality. In fact, Innes may be
the equal of Elizabeth Weir in literary ability - he certainly is in the
realm of unintended humor....

Yes, I see it now! Blake's phrase can be interpreted so many different ways!

content level of posts: This coupled with your alloted* measure of wit and
felicity, and to the extent you are competent in.

:)

Also thanks to Terry from me for the illustrative paragraphs.

Lynne, it is an interesting form of 'ambiguity'. Is it factories OR schools,
one or the other? Or is it something applicable to factories AND schools; an
inclusive comment on a type of mechanising institution.

The phrase is almost exclusively /used/ from our sense of Victorian factory
conditions, whereas I have always taken it to be more figurative, and in the
sense of Terry's citation.

The other comment above I pass over, since, as with Freud, it stalls
intellectually at the subject of sex in a nontranscendent impotence.

All Praise the Giant Albion!

And I don't, Peter Strawman. But it is often ugly. Perhaps as ugly as the
sentiment it expresses? And around these muddy pools the hogs now gather
delighting in each other's muck.

Let me see just how well you write of your own original ideas of something
that might be on topic here; an appreciation of Blake's reference; or
Shakespearean citations and allusions in Byatt's quartet; the narrators
commentary in the novel adjunct to the character's; the possibility of
forceful original discovery where others have seen nothing; perception and
reason...

It is your choice to either wallow and besmirch, or behave otherwise, and
your own behavior is the witness of what's true, and your own real measure
of interest in a subject, and its worth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. This informs your previous point. Perception has nothing to
do with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason in a causal way, but is necessary in order to communicate
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective of what is seen. In fact, necessary to objectivise
what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the traditional view is that perspectives of individuals
depart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more or less widely from the truth, with the degree of departure
explicable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by cultural, psychological, or possibly more &quot;contingent&quot;
factors. For
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; postmodernists, however, there is no &quot;Truth&quot; to perceive well or
poorly, so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every communication (even what would be taken as traditionally
&quot;true&quot;) is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mere expression of probably unconscious urges.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not all that up on theory anymore, but this sounds more like a
mixture
&gt;&gt;&gt; of structuralism, postmodernism and Freud.

&gt;&gt; Did you have some particular writer in mind? I was trying to
describe
&gt;&gt; a position that (the early, I think) Foucault might have supported,
&gt;&gt; from the point of view of someone who wished to support tradition.
&gt;&gt;&quot;Unconscious urges&quot; may have been a little over the top. I suppose
&gt;&gt; that I may have been in error in trying to understand what Mr.
Innes's
&gt;&gt; paragraph implied, and in choosing words with which I might say
&gt;&gt; something on the same topic, not to mention in figuring out how to
&gt;&gt; write it out all in a way that could convey an appropriate point.
If
&gt;&gt; you're _relatively_ familiar with theory,

&gt; Argghhh! Conversation about modern literary theory! Can't breathe! &gt;gasp&lt; .
&gt; . . no oxygen . . . &gt;cough cough&lt; . . . .

&gt; do you think you could post
&gt;&gt; something like a straightened-out paraphrase of the above, or point
&gt;&gt; out which words are used inappropriately? It may be that the
contrast
&gt;&gt; I was trying to draw didn't come across clearly.

&gt; You want me to try to paraphrase the prose of Phil Innes? I would never be
&gt; so presumptuous!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not evident what such a person would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think education might be for. Presumably, it all comes down to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politics, eventually: children should be taught what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; powers-that-be believe they should know.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the foundation of modern educational theory, according to
Dewey.

&gt;&gt; I thought Dewey thought children should be taught what Dewey and
other
&gt;&gt; psychologists thought children ought to know and to be able to do,
in
&gt;&gt; order to participate fully in a democratic society. Exactly the
&gt;&gt; opposite of their being taught to be good little worker cogs in the
&gt;&gt; machine.

&gt;&quot;Every teacher should realize he is a social servant set apart for the
&gt; maintenance of the proper social order and the securing of the right social
&gt; growth.&quot; John Dewey, 1897

&gt;&quot;Schools should be factories in which raw products, children, are to be
&gt; shaped and formed into finished products. . .manufactured like nails, and
&gt; the specifications for manufacturing will come from government and
&gt; industry.&quot; Elwood Cubberly, future Dean of Education at Stanford, 1905

&gt;&quot;In our dreams. . .people yield themselves with perfect docility to our
&gt; molding hands. The present educational conventions [intellectual and
&gt; character education] fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition we
&gt; work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try
&gt; to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of
&gt; learning or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors,
&gt; educators, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great
&gt; artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians,
&gt; statesmen, of whom we have ample supply. The task we set before ourselves is
&gt; very simple. . .we will organize children. . .and teach them to do in a
&gt; perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect
&gt; way.&quot;
&gt; Rockefeller Education Board report, 1906

&gt;&quot;Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in
&gt; prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an
&gt; accident but the result of substantial education, which, scientifically
&gt; defined, is the subsumption of the individual.&quot;
&gt; William Torrey Harris, US Commissioner of Education from 1889 to 1906

&gt;&quot;We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a
&gt; very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal
&gt; education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.&quot;
&gt; U.S. President Woodrow Wilson

&gt; All quotations are from John Taylor Gatto, *The Underground History of
&gt; American Education: An Intimate Investigation into the Problem of Modern
&gt; Schooling* (New York: Oxford Village Press, 2001). Gatto was voted the New
&gt; York City Teacher of the Year three times and the New York State Teacher of
&gt; the Year in 1991.

Wow, they were blunt in those days, weren't they? I knew modern
education was designed to be compatible with the factory system (time
periods, bells, rows and columns of desks), but I hadn't been aware
that it had been planned to be like that explicitly for that reason.
Of course, it's true that the vast majority of the population won't be
exceptional. And that it's important for children to know what the
government expects. But today, nobody believes _that_.

Yes indeed. In Orwell's great defence of Shakespeare against Tolstoy he
asked, even if all Tolstoy's criticism of the writing were true, what then
has sustained our interest in the subject for 400 years? Why are we more

All very well Peter. Perhaps if you think this is a zoo, then admit your own
common animality in it.

All I really suggest above is that use makes master. And it is only our
behavior which makes usenet a zoo, and no necessary prescription that we
could not be able to discuss something seriously about the subject and our
own perspectives to it.

This is, in my experience, more fun than less. I usually value other genuine
opinions and perspectives than my own for at least their novelty in an
educational sense. And other perspectives and experiences than my own seem
less cloying - after all - I am not so insecure that someone needs to
reassure me all the time that what I say is okay, and I should be careful of
strangers and strange opinion.

More power to you.

In most kinds of writing, and many kinds of speech, the goal is to say

I don't agree. The basis of discussion is a common culture.
Education teaches &quot;individuals&quot; to understand the common culture, so
that they can communicate with other people, and learn to become

This is a difficult question for me to answer. Speaking purely
personally, I find literature and music to be important in my life,
and I think people ought to be given the knowledge, skills, and
opportunity they'll need if they find this true for them, as well
(music and art appreciation in schools, etc.). But the ideal is to be
so engrossed in some occupation and real, &quot;down-to-earth&quot; way of life,
that escape (no matter how noble a form that escape takes) isn't
necessary. As Frost says, &quot;my object in living is to unite \ my
avocation and my vocation, as my two eyes make one in sight.&quot; Most
people don't ever encounter the &quot;existentialist dilemma.&quot;

Bianca, I see that today we agree on nothing :)

However, let it not become a competition. I think we may use terms
differently, or simply have come to differing conclusions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Have you ever known your conscience to be wrong?

&gt; I have made decisions or formed beliefs that, later, I recognized to
&gt; be wrong, yes.

&gt;&gt; The question of right or wrong by discussion, and the role of
influencing
&gt;&gt; another person, is otherwise as you say. Every expression is an attempt
to
&gt;&gt; influence others.

&gt; In most kinds of writing, and many kinds of speech, the goal is to say
&gt; the truth, or to say what will make readers or listeners more capable

Quite. That is not necessarily fascism, but it is a fascistic method. But I
did not mean to impose a view on others, but to state a view. A comment on

&gt; I don't agree. The basis of discussion is a common culture.
&gt; Education teaches &quot;individuals&quot; to understand the common culture, so
&gt; that they can communicate with other people, and learn to become

I think the process you describe is one side of the coin, but there is

Sorry, I don't mean to be attempting to &quot;compete,&quot; as if the thread

I'm not sure why you bring the question of fascism into the
discussion. We had been discussing the acceptability of various forms
of interpretations of texts, according to differing current theories
of interpretation. I hold not only that bringing in the idea of a
speaker's or writer's attempting to influence others is much too easy,
but also that it's very simply not true in the case of the best
writing. Expertise and practice enable a few to be able to express
the truth, as discovered by the best researchers of the time, to other
educated people. That's not a personal &quot;influence,&quot; just the truth.

I happen not to believe that a reasonable person can be very much
influenced without his knowledge or consent, but rather that education
and training in the use of reason allow one to detect attempts at
propaganda, and control one's own will. But that's likely neither
here nor there, for present purposes.

Of course. I totally agree. I didn't mean to imply something like
that &quot;all should be impersonal.&quot; But it's been my experience that
individuality is always perceived against the background of a
particular culture. Paradoxically, probably, I've sometimes perceived
this fact as its opposite: in dealing with people from other cultures,
I've often found that their unfamiliarity with the subcultures and
discriminations of my own community, prevents them from &quot;placing&quot; me
the way another American might. Sometimes this is pleasant, and
sometimes not. And also, different people, even within the exact same

I can agree with that, and also state it s inverse. Interesting you should
use the word 'chaos' above.

I think you missed a thread here by about one week of a discussion of;
'chaos' contrasted to cosmos.

Cosmos is a level of achieved social order, but lacking any further valency.
It's a crystallised state. Chaos in contradistinction has no apparent
outside order, however it is rich with creative individual potentiality. The
two operate cyclically, and neither is in fact sustainable as a permanent
state. This was the Greek idea, and until recently our own. These days the
word Chaos is often used in a derogatory manner, whereas the
state-of-the-art system of Cosmos is not.

In this way I am disagreeing with you. Individual Chaotic agents may be
collated into a reformulated social Cosmos.Which in turn can establish the
basis for new Chaotic agents to emerge, in a perennial cycle of mutual
interactions.

Yes. Hamlet's &quot;I know not should&quot; is a chaotic sort of statement. His
orientation [at least at that time] is not to the social order which he sees
is stale and corrupt - and with perhaps only one exception in the play,
lacking any 'soul'.

The Court of Denmark is unresponsive and 'dead' and Hamlet spends 3 hours of
the play in a Chaotic stew rejecting the social status quo wherever he finds
it. Only near the end does his own character coalese around the skull of
Yorick speech.

A similar theme in Lear has the King appealing to social praise, and
rejecting the individual demur of Cordelia. At the end of the play Lear
comes to stand opposite his previous inert social stance and re-encounters
his own soul, again the social refusenik Chaotic-Cordelia being the symbolic
or catalytic agent.

When have you ever tried to 'have a conversation' Tom? You are always so
obsessed with attempting superiority over other people I doubt you even
notice them. You seem unable to restate anyone's opinion without jumping in
with your own judgements.

If you ever feel secure enough to actually listen without offering

I think that, for myself, conceiving of society as &quot;crystalline&quot;
grates. It may be that metaphors from physics just aren't congenial
to my way of thinking. If the Ideal is conceived as orderly and
rule-based, then the Real is consequently conceived as dangerous and
unpredictable, at best to be managed so that it must stay within
certain lines. I think we are probably not thinking along the same
lines here.

I was recently reading Samuel Huntington's 1995 book, &quot;The Clash of
Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.&quot; Professor Huntington
(of Harvard) describes four (rather than two) general types of
geopolitical configuration:
1. Unipolar: only a single major power.
2. Dual: similar to what existed during the cold war, with a
single dualistic conflict and also some unaligned states.
3. Several civilizations: Huntington argues this is what we have
now.
4. Chaotic: no major powers, only individual nation-states.
I don't think I'd read any academic book on international affairs
before, and I found Huntington informative, though I know his thesis
is very controversial, and though his facts concerning Bosnia and
Saddam, for example, are extremely out of date.

Coincidentally enough, Harold Bloom, following Vico (about whom I know
next to nothing), divides Western literary history into four major
periods, as well: theological, aristocratic (early-modern), romantic
(up to about High Modernism), and chaotic (us).

I think I'm finding that, for me, psychoanalytic explanations,
involving reified entities like the &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;id,&quot; are unhelpful, in
comparison to ordinary-language -- or, _perhaps_, sociological --
ones. Which is mostly to say that I don't think I think according to
those lines, and at the moment I'm more interested in how I do think
than in how I might. (Which sounds Frederica-ish, I know, though I
think I'm a bit older than she was in any of the books.) I was
taught, more or less, to recognize that there are many, many theories
about the mind, soul, etc., and to consider all of them optional and
open to refutation. What I learned (for good or bad) was not to be
able to accept a new vocabulary without wanting to understand the
theory behind it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I see it now! Blake's phrase can be interpreted so many different
&gt;&gt; ways!
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just like how the word light, &quot;at the rawest level,&quot; is a phallic
&gt;&gt;&gt; symbol because candles shed light! It's the exact same type of
&gt; ambiguity!

&gt;&gt; I was waiting for that. Go to sleep. Don't forget to blow your candle
out.
