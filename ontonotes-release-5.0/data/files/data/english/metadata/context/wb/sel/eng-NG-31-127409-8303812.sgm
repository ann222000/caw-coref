It's 80s @ 8 time again! Showcasing 1987, this Wednesday July 18 @ 8PM
at The Cottage Bistro (29th and Main).

Awesome 80s tunes and trivia.

Hey all,
Well, my YWAM community is away in Whistler on a retreat and
I'm over here in Montreal for a wedding. The thing is I'm in need of a
ride home from the airport on this Wednesday night (the 18th) as the
people who would normaly do the pickup are all at the retreat. I'll be
more than happy to kick in $15 for fuel. I'll be arriving at 8:30pm and
probably be standing curbside at 9pm so somebody can just fly by and
pick me up. If you can help out, please let me know asap so I can stop
hunting. email me at bish ... @gmail.com or just reply to this.

Thanks, You guys rule.
