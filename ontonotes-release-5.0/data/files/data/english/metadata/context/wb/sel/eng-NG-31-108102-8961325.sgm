Jack Hanna, flamingo stuck in airport turnstile
Animal expert frees himself, bird in crate rescued by firefighters

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Animal expert Jack Hanna and an 11-month-old flamingo
became trapped while trying to squeeze through a security turnstile at
an Ohio airport. It took firefighters to finally get the flamingo
out.

Hanna, the director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and a frequent guest
on nationally televised talk shows, was returning from a zoo
fundraiser with a mongoose, a small leopard and the flamingo. Three
other people were with them.

The entourage arrived at the Ohio State University Airport just after
midnight Sunday to find the terminal closed. The only way to leave the
tarmac was through a 10-foot-tall metal turnstile with several
horizontal bars - not the easiest exit to squeeze through when you are
traveling with boxed-up animals, Hanna said.

&quot;I never thought about the crate being square and the turnstile being
round,&quot; he said.

Hanna, 60, pushed the flamingo's 2-foot-by-3-foot compartment into the
turnstile, then continued pushing while straddling the crate.

&quot;I was stuck like a worm. My eyes were as big as grapefruits,&quot; he
said. &quot;I can't describe the feeling in my stomach. I can't move up or
down. The bars are on your face.&quot;

Hanna said he eventually squirmed free, leaving the flamingo still
wedged inside and everyone else trapped on the tarmac. He then walked
to a nearby fire station for help. It took three firefighters to hoist
the flamingo's crate up and out of the turnstile, he said.

Columbus fire department logs show the firefighters arrived at the
airport at 12:30 a.m. for a &quot;flamingo rescue,&quot; spokeswoman Kelly
McGuire said.

Hanna joked that the next time he flies through the airport, the
biggest animal he will bring is a gerbil.
