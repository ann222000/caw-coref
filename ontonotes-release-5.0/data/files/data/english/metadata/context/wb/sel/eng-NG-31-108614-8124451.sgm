Using a laser to facilitate hydrogen-hydrogen fusion within Earth's troposphere.

Hi:

Is it theoretically-possible to facilitate hydrogen-hydrogen fusion
within the earth's troposphere using a laser? If so, what would be the
maximum wavelength [or minimum frequency] and minimum intensity of
laser light required for this? Also what would be the minimum
thickness of the laser beam necessary for this application?

The application of this nuclear fusion is not generation of power but
rather to produce a spectacular light show in the night sky -- using
the minimum light intensity, maximum wavelength, and minimum beam
thickness required.

I am guessing that the minimum wavelength required is too short for
the human eye to see. However, the effects of the laser-induced fusion
maybe visible.

Thanks,

Radium

Sure, all you need to do is build your lasers from unobtainium so they
don't vaporize when you turn them on and power them with a couple
of Galaxy class starship matter-antimatter reactors.

Or, you could use ordinary lasers directly like the laser light show
people do.

Oh, don't forget to notify the FAA you are going to do it or you go
to jail.

But the fusion-induced light will be much brighter and will cause a

No, you aren't. You are simply asking the latest in a series of

If you were serious, you would have learned something about laser or

Shining a laser into the sky without notification is illegal, period.

No. Are you a troll or did you not bother hitting wikipedia for
nuclear fusion.

Almost all hydrogen on earth is protium, with some small percentage
being deuterium... so you're trying to do p-p fusion which is weak
force mediated... you have to overcome columb repulsion at the exact
same time there is a weak mediated inverse beta decay to a neutron,
positron, and electron neutrino. Thats how the sun shines, and the
reason its so slow and hard to do is the reason its still shining
rather than burning up billions of years ago.

This ignores a little problem with nuclear fusion called confinement
or the Lawson criterion.

I've been wondering alot lately about fusion and probability. Coming from
the perspective of my own very strange views on physics, I think that there
may be a possibility of approaching the question of fusion as if it were
actually a question of probabilities somehow.

Unfortunately I dont really have a mathematical model of the atom to work
with, just a philosophical one. So, all I can do is tell silly stories and
spew bullshit.

The probability, if expressed that way, is still weighted. Getting fusion
for free by ignoring that is like trying to invoke Maxwell's Demon, the
hypothetical agency that might sort particles according to velocity ranges
as a way to 'pump' heat without doing the expected work.

Even if the universe is viewed as an informational matrix, the pacman still
can't walk through the walls of the maze. We don't make the rules of the

then we're lucky if we understand how we can do it.

My understanding of nuclear physics is not the traditional particle based
approach. Basically I walk around believing things that nobody else does,
because I can.

That being said -

I believe that the existence of length is best modelled probabilistically. I
think that you can have waves which are merely probabilistic fluctuations.
The probability which is fluctuating is the probability that length exists.
I am pretty sure that a working mathematical model can be created to do
this. Go ahead and take a minute to finish laughing if you need to.

Starting with that philosophy, somehow one needs to model the atom.

I think that by modifying the Bohr model with some probabilistic
considerations, one might be able overcome the shortcomings of the Bohr atom
and salvage the model.

My thinking is pretty much along the lines of modelling gravitational space
bending probabilistically on large scales, and this might also work with the
Bohr atom somehow. For example, the length segment from the Earth to the Sun
is &quot;probabilistically rarified&quot; existentially, so it might look like some
value L but it is really an 'expected value' of something like (0.97)*L . I
just pulled the 0.97 from thin air for explanatory purposes.

One might be able to salvage the Bohr atom by doing things like that.

No, no need. :) I wish I was awake and informed enough to debate it
properly, but my own view isn't too far removed. I think of information
being a pattern of flux and stasis that extends beyond our knowing, and
finiteness to be based on our perceptions. That might be a way to say that
the concept of a particle only exists because we can do this. It also means
the same thing for a wave though. The reality is capable of being either,
but is not either, if you follow.. I'm not sure about probability, as to me
that as Samuel Delany put it &quot;gives mathematical expression to our
ignorance, not to our knowledge&quot;. We can model stuff so long as we realise
that its anchorage in the greater pattern is like a sea anchor, not a
grapple and fluke embedded in anything so solid as a rock.

Based on all that, I suspect that information is as fundamental, maybe more
so, than mass-energy.

I haven't looked at this for a long time, and probably never knew enough to
understand what the Bohr model of the atom means, but two thoughts arise:
if that difference from a nominal L is constant over all things observed,
there's no way to know. On the other hand, we can see things in maths that
show new ways to see what's in front of us, even without breaking the
rules. If you make the fibbonacci sequence starting from an arbitrary
unity, 1, you can work up through integers by adding the previously used
integer to build a repeating pattern of increase. From that pattern you can
deduce the Golden Mean, and work downwards OR upwards, and working
downwards you don't get a 1,1,2,3,5, you get a whole new values as you move
from any point.

What that shows is that any theory with mathematics based on an integer
start is probably suspect, and the sooner a pattern can be derived from
looking at it, to restate it using what will probably be an 'irrational'
constant, the more likely it is to be truly 'rational'. :)

It seems that information might be the fundamental building block of the
universe, after examining the doubel slit experiment, and taking a look at
how which-way information works. The problem is that information is not
quite a physically existent object.

Attempts to construct a universe out of information alone seems to me like a
very bad idea, unless you can explain quite succinctly how something like
&quot;information&quot; (which seems rather quasi-existent) can make up atoms,
molecules and planets. This is like Copenhagen on steroids.

Many ? I'd argue all.

While the idea may seem tenuous at first glance, it is certainly more
sensible than information beign the fundamental building block.

The key is that the outcome of a random event does not yet exist, until the
uncertainty is destroyed, then the outcome can be said to exist. Prior to
that, multiple outcomes are all partially likely, and therefore partially
existent. No different than finding 2.732181... cars per household in a way.

The difference is that yo uneed a third existential form, existential
indeterminacy. i.e., not sure if something exists or not hence existence is
indeterminate.

'Information' is an ill-defined concept at this level, and might well not
be fundamental, it's unlikely anyway, given that we are in a position of
trying to define it. The only statement I can make about it before I start
saying lots of stuff and getting lost, is that I mean a pattern that is not
just derived by our awareness of it. It would therefore include the
uncertain pattern.

Why? Presumably Schroedinger's cat knows if it is or is not dead, even
after the deed is done? We don't know till we open the box, but the
underlying pattern is, and shall be. Without that the cat's indeterminacy
can be asserted, but the fact remains, if the cat is alive, it knows it
whether we can or not.

Another way of looking at it is that two slit thing, Young's experiment. If
you accept that light can be a particle (as proven by the photoelectric
effect) the light has to know ahead of time where to land to contribute to
the interference pattern. OR, if you look at it as a wave, you can more
easily explain the interference, until you see that a single photon can
show this, though clearly it can't alone go through both slits. Either way,
the photon needs information that can't be reached within the time it has
for travel. That not only means that the old argument about wave/particle
duality is pointless, as light can't be either, but some 'thing' for want
of better term, that can appear as either, and possibly other 'things' we
haven't experienced or modelled, but it also means that its nature depends
on connections that 'travel' faster than it itself can.

That's the 'underlying pattern' I'm talking about. We can express it as a
probablility, but that's almost like a Spot The Ball competition, where the
only way to assert a location is by drawing on all the circumstantial
evidence pointing to it. Not that this is entirely bad, it is at least
thorough. It's almost the same as paraphrasing the Sherlock Holmes thing,
and saying &quot;when you have eliminated all overt possibilites, whatever
remains, no matter how covert, must be the truth.&quot; That's not ideal though.

Some truths can be proven by simple assertion and experiment, they don't
require probability to model them, no invocation of the unknown is needed.
The obvious is 2+2=4, but there are more interesting applied examples.

Case in point: The four-colour map problem. I was told that it is NOT
proven that four colours is the minimum required to colour a map without
adjacent regions being the same colour. I even asked a local university
mathematics professor why this was so. He told me he didn't know, that no-
one knew. My point is that if we have to 'prove' it by looking at all the
possible ways a map might be coloured, we can thrash through it eternally,
maybe. It's certainly intractable that way, but if you draw a circle on a
background, you have two regions, loop out and back to circle, that's
three, then loop out from the new arc and back to circle, that's 4. Now,
try again. You can't do it without isolating an existing region, which
means you can still colour all of them without using more than four
colours. That to me is a proof, so looking further to 'solve' that problem
is like walking into a room with a single lamp in it and looking at every
dark corner and saying no, the lamp is not there, before probablility is
eliminated leaving one location left for the lamp.

In short, as you can tell, probability bothers me, fundamentally, because
it isn't constrained to a limited set of conditions, except where those
conditions are ALREADY limited by our design, which is what bookmakers
depend on for a living, and even then it's still very risky. Card players
have better containment of possibilities... When trying to invoke it to
'explain' the universe at large, it boils down to saying 'we don't know'.
Which is ok, it's just that to enshrine it in grand theoretical terms looks
highly disingenuous, and I think that physics has not solved the hubris of
beleiving that everything can be explained in clocklike detail, it's just
found another way to state the old desire.

It's probably easier to think of dice. You could say that &quot;there exists
outcome Heads&quot;, and that &quot;there exists outcome Tales&quot;, but to say that they
both exist simultaneously, knowing that they are mutually exclusive, well,
nobody would buy that unless you had something like partial existence.

So you have &quot;H if not T&quot;, and you have &quot;T if not H&quot;. But you cannot have &quot;H
and T&quot; because they are mutually exclusive.

I disagree completely. The promulgation of information as a physical object
in this experiment is an illusion. An act of philosophical desperation.

There is a very straightforward way to understand this experiment, that
space is indeterminately continuous or discrete.

The reason it acts either as wave or particle is because either you asked
whichway, or you did not. If you ask whichway then you have already imposed
discreteness on your answer. If you dont ask whichway then you have imposed
continuity. It is just that simple.

How can space be both continuous and discrete &quot;indeterminately&quot; ? Ask a
mathematician about partially random numbers of the form (a + ~b) where ~b
is an uncertain quantity.

So, in your truth table of logical nonsense, how does one characterize the

Where's the existential quantifier that says &quot;maybe there exists an
x,y,z...&quot;  ?

Maybe there's an H.

Maybe there's a T.

Why must everything be so black and white all the time ? Everything is
either T or F. Exists, or does not. Whats up with that ?

&gt; I disagree completely. The promulgation of information as a physical
&gt; object in this experiment is an illusion. An act of philosophical
&gt; desperation.

&gt; There is a very straightforward way to understand this experiment,
&gt; that space is indeterminately continuous or discrete.

&gt; The reason it acts either as wave or particle is because either you
&gt; asked whichway, or you did not. If you ask whichway then you have
&gt; already imposed discreteness on your answer. If you dont ask whichway
&gt; then you have imposed continuity. It is just that simple.
">

Yes, that's what I meant. It acts according to the choices we make in
seeing it, which means it is not limited by us, except where it interacts
with us. Discreteness and continuity relate to the stasis and flux I
mentioned before. Both exist in all things. We can also choose to see
either stasis or flux in ordinary macroscopic phenomena. If we watch the
water flow from a tap we see flux, if we watch the standing pattern of the
surface of the falling water we see stasis. Changes in that stasis cannot
occur faster than the flux which carry them, but previous interaction
retains connection.

The same is true for light, as tested by Alain Aspect. The entangled states
are the underlying pattern. An interaction making two sources of light from
a common tightly controlled source showed one viewed state to be correlated
with the other. While it has been said that the 'signal' between them
travels faster than light, it's not needed to say that. The light travels
at its own speed. The underlying pattern has no 'speed' at all, in any
traditional sense. My use of the term 'information' includes this
underlying pattern, as well as the manifest signal we get. I don't know
what else to call it, but I realise a better word would help.

Again, this is what I mean by 'information', there is a known, and an
unknown that has probabilistic constraints on it. a is a stasis that is
modified by the flux of b and vice versa. Given the knowledge of
constraints we can assert superposed stases and do calculations without
needing b resolved, so long as we accept that we don't know b and that the
underlying connections in everything can determine it, including our own
interactions and choices. That it works is interesting, but that doesn't
justify live-dead cats. Any model that leaves states like those is in need
of fixing, I think, whether it works or not. On the other hand, I guess it
depends on what our priorities are. Right now we can't see beyond the
manifest pattern with the current theories, but they do make possible the
tools that might eventually lead to being able to see further.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 'Information' is an ill-defined concept at this level, and might well
&gt; &gt;&gt; not be fundamental, it's unlikely anyway, given that we are in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; position of trying to define it. The only statement I can make about
&gt; &gt;&gt; it before I start saying lots of stuff and getting lost, is that I
&gt; &gt;&gt; mean a pattern that is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; just derived by our awareness of it. It would therefore include the
&gt; &gt;&gt; uncertain pattern.

&gt; &gt; I think that I have a similar understanding, but I would consider all
&gt; &gt; of these other patterns which were possible but did not come to be, I
&gt; &gt; would consider them to be trivial.

&gt; I wouldn't consider them at all. :) I'd instead look at all the
&gt; circumstances I could reach to narrow down the need to express anything as
&gt; a probability. What couldn't be deduced or remembered from past experience
&gt; would be tested. Actually I might consider them during the time I took to
&gt; do the rest of it, but only then, or during other spare time.

&gt; &gt; So you have &quot;H if not T&quot;, and you have &quot;T if not H&quot;. But you cannot
&gt; &gt; have &quot;H and T&quot; because they are mutually exclusive.

&gt; Neat, it certainly seems to exlude that notorious live-deadness of the
cat.
&gt; On the other hand, the statements work because they admit to a state of
&gt; unknowing, which is my point. To use them to assert the actual state of
the
&gt; cat itself, OR the dice, goes beyond that. To me, THAT is the kind of
&gt; philosophical desperation you speak of below. :) No matter how that 'If'
is
&gt; expressed, it's still an unknown.

The only problem with Shrodingers cat is that the cat is an ordinary sized
object. The example of the cat is very bad, unless the cat is the size of an
atom. Then Shrodingers cat can indeed exists in both states indeterminately,
but this will never be the case for a real cat which is of normal size.

Shrodinger himself would use these examples to joke about the absurdities of
QM. The technical fallacy was applying a quantum scale property to an
ordinary sized objoct.

I'm not sure if it is desperation or not. In logic you have True and False
but there is no such thing as &quot;maybe&quot;. I dont know why there should'nt be.

Probability theory was developed pretty much simultaneously by the Soviets
and the West more or less independently during the 20th century. I dont
think that either development considers &quot;existential indeterminacy&quot;, and I
think that this must be a central issue for anyone who wants to invent his
own probability theory from scratch. Both treatments carefully sidestep this
issue, or construct arguments which make it possible to gloss over this very
glaring problem.

However, science has already adopted the fundamental philosophy, even if the
notational and algebraic constructions have not. Shrodingers cat is exactly
what I'm talking about. Ordinarily either LifeExists, or DeathExists, not
both. And Shrodingers cat violates this, you CAN have a mixed state where
you have that simultaneously : &quot;maybe&quot; LifeExists and &quot;maybe&quot; DeathExists.

Probability theory attempts to ignore this, so much so that in my opinion it
is really quite scandalous.

This is probably something that a trained mathematician would have
difficulty believing, that space can be regarded as being alternatively
discrete or continuous, and that the distinction on the qunatum scale is
indeterminate.

As an example,
[1] I'm going to give you a random number but you must request it first.
[2] If you ask &quot;which&quot; then you will get a discrete output from the set
{1,2,3,4,5,6}
[3] If you dont ask &quot;which&quot; then you get a continuous valued output from the
uinterval [1,6]

It all depends on whether or not one asks &quot;whichway ?&quot;.

It is just that simple IMO.

I can agree to some extent with the justification for information theory.
But yeah, most of this goes back to the whole objective / subjective
argument. Personally, I think that the objective implies discreteness and
the subjective implies continuity. The fact that you have an objective /
subjective duality of sorts, this only reinforces my view that you also have
a continuous / discrete duality as well.

The problem is that mathematics has avoided this question of existence, and
clings to an existence / nonexistence dichotomy.

That's all well and good until you come to something like  a*0 = 0, and try
to solve for (a).

Live-dead cats are justifiable by allowing existential indeterminacy. Sartre
and Heidegger completely messed up the whole thing so badly, it's a
disgrace.

Interesting, like the thing about King Canute. He was also allegedly
positing a stupid idea, but actually he staged that event with the throne
and the sea (figuratively if not literally) to prove that there are limits
to the powers of a king. Strange that these things end up reflecting badly

Nor do I, despite anything I've said that might imply a desire for things
to be black or white. I don't. Actualities are usually on continuua. The
Scots have three verdicts in a court case, guilty, not guilty, and not
proven. Maybe physics might find these useful.

There are things like how a pedal bike stays upright, how a bee can fly,
how fire works, and many things that we control, take for granted, yet have
no full models for. Physics might have a use for a 'not proven' when
assessing these. I know these are all macroscopic things, but I think they
can't be considered isolated from the small scale phenomena. If they could,
physicists would not have any grounds for asserting that the small scale
events will offer the explanations, yet this is exactly what is hoped. I
think this is why the cat trouble arises.

I agree, but I'm not sure if the reasons are the same. The 'cat' defined as
a single entity, appears to cause bother, but a cat isn't a single entity.
The organisms in its gut won't identify with the cat at all. The hairs and
nails will grow for a while after death. While there is a central nervous
system that can shut down many organs at one time during death, we no more
understand the precise 'moment of death' than any of those other things,
the bike, the flame, the bee's flight. Far less in fact. People will have
moral arguments about it for as long as we can imagine human life
persisting, especially where the CNS doesn't shut down before many other
things do...

My way, copout though it can look at times, is to see life and death in all
things. Life expressed flux, death as stasis, and even then, each having
the other in it (like the yin/yang idea). Neither can work without the
other. I'm no mathematician, so please don't ask me to try to express this
that way. :) The nearest I got was 14 or so vaguely logical expressions in
short single sentences or phrases whose meanings might as easily be
misunderstood as recognised.

That's where I started from too, examining the concepts of objective and

The experiment is more wierd that that.

Imagine that you have some &quot;magic water&quot; which is behaving very strangely.
Sometimes it behaves like ice, and sometimes is behaves like liquid, and
this is completely unrelated to temperature or melting point.

If you ask &quot;how hard is it&quot;, or &quot;how syiff is it&quot;, then it will act like ice
for you, simply because you asked a question which requires it to do so.

But if you ask &quot;what is it's viscosity&quot;, then it obliges you by behaving as
a liquid, because you asked a question which requires that it be a liquid.

Now, instead of liquid-solid duality, I believe that there is a
continuous-discrete duality. The wave-particle duality is just a
continuous-discrete duality of space, and photons and other fundamental
particles are merely probabilistic wavefomrs in this dimensional fabric.

If you ask space a question which requires a discrete answer, it will act
like it is discrete.

But if you ask a question which expects an answer where the photon behaves
like a wave, then that is how space will answer you.

I should also state that this is not part of the standard model, and my
views are not mainstream physics.
