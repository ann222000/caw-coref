Part 1
Please see part 0 (template) for warnings and summary.

Disclaimer: Yadda, yadda, Joss, yadda, yadda, Fox.

Comments: 1)To avoid confusion, I'll clear it up now: River's dream is written
in the present tense, but it is a memory, not happening in the timeline of the
fic itself.

2) Imagine my delight when an interview with Joss regarding the upcoming movie
had him stating that, even if it wasn't delved into specifically, fans could
now accept as canon the fact that Book once took orders from evil, evil men.
Hence the advancement of his role in this story.

Zoe paced the ship, unable to sleep. She kept telling herself it wasn't because
of the stories River had almost been telling. The pictures that the disembodied
words had bought forth. She wondered if Mal or Simon or Kaylee had gotten the
same images or had processed the words into their own meanings.

She clutched her elbows tighter, shivering. It had gotten noticeably colder too
fast to make any form of sense. Her memory flashed at her, not too quickly, she
saw all the small indications that they had ignored the day before. A shiver
here, River's breath on the window there.

A moon, she remembered, is drained of all heat the minute the sunlight
disappears, unable to retain any of it. Not that the sun had given them much
heat at all, merely a relief from cold. It still didn't explain why the ship
had lost heat.

***

Book had tried to sleep, but hadn't come anywhere near an approximation of it.
He decided to see if anyone else was awake. It was when he tried to sit up, for
the first time in a matter of hours, that he noticed the stiffness of his
joints, the reluctance of his body to move.

The fact that he had not noticed the cold did not surprise him. It reminded him
of a parable from Earth that Was. That if you put a frog in a pot of boiling
water it will jump right out, but if you place it in a pot of warm water it
will stay still, content to remain while the water is slowly heated until the
frog has let itself be boiled.

The lesson remained true, he supposed, but he was a might unsure of why exactly
they didn't just put a lid on the pot.

***

He turned, twisting further into the sheets that clung to him. It made him
scramble at them, tore them away and the air that covered him gave him chills.
With a sigh, he gave up hope of every getting a peaceful sleep that night. He
refused to accept that it was anything other than the cold that kept him
awake.

*Their cries will ring in your ears, not mine.*

Mal's fingers refused to work properly. He swore as he tried, again and again,
to open his hatch. He was thick and sluggish, but most of all he was cold. The
chills had inched through his skin all the way to the bones and he didn't know
whether he could ever stop shaking.

Serenity creaked at him when he finally succeeded and it made him nervous. The
corridor was empty and dark as he began to make his way to the engine room. He
had more than a sneaking suspicion as to what that missing piece did in the
engines.

Voices broke into his mind as he neared the kitchen. Zoe and Book huddled in
blankets, the kettle boiling away, Mal's throat tightened at the thought of hot
tea. Well, it wasn't like he could do much with the great hulking machine in
this condition.

&quot;Don't mind if I do.&quot;

***

If Simon had learned anything as a trauma surgeon, it was how to sleep when
there was time to do it, even when he wasn't tired, when he was still buzzing
from a twelve hour successful operation. Or when he couldn't stop hearing his
sister's words. Even in sleep his brain was deftly able to distinguish between
the normal, everyday bustle and the urgent currents that mean he's needed.

He could not tell what woke him up this time. The first thing he became aware
of was the stifling heat of all the blankets piled on top of him. Second, was
the familiar scratching of pencils on paper on the floor next to his bed.

&quot;River?&quot;

His voice was thick with sleep and confusion, something that solved itself the
second he pushed the blankets away. The air that snaked over him made him gasp,
it was that cold. He immediately pulled the top blanket back over his shoulders
as he propped himself up on one arm.

&quot;Not sleeping. Can't make me.&quot; Her stubborn voice insisted. &quot;Not tonight.&quot;

He rolled and looked over the edge of the bed. She sat propped up on one arm on
the floor and, in Simon's estimation, was wearing every single item of clothing
she owned, layered thick and clumsily over each other. On the paper in front of
her, she was carefully and methodically drawing sets of matrioshka dolls.

Something about their faces made him uneasy.

&quot;So, did you put all the blankets on the ship on my bed, or just half?&quot;

She shrugged.

&quot;Thermoregulation. I told you to rug up.&quot;

Simon watched as she took a deliberate breath, letting it out in one long
stream. He was surprised to notice the air mist in front of her face, the
carbon dioxide heavier and warmer than the oxygen around her.

&quot;Doc?&quot; Mal's voice crackled through the com. &quot;If you're awake, might as well
meet us in the kitchen.&quot;

***

Jayne stretched his mouth out in a huge yawn, letting the oxygen flood his
lungs and wake him up as he made his way into the kitchen.

&quot;What's up, Mal?&quot; They stared at him. &quot;What?&quot;

Simon gestured to the shirt and pants he'd been sleeping in.

&quot;Aren't you cold?&quot;

It took him a moment to register the five people in front of him, all huddled
in blankets and shivering, all nursing steaming mugs. Mal, Book, Zoe, Simon and
River.

&quot;Yeah. I put shoes on, didn't I?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Why's it so cold, anyway?&quot;

Mal nodded to the metal part on the table.

&quot;We lost heat.&quot;

&quot;I told you.&quot; River sounded like she was scolding a naughty child as she
reached out, she stopped just short of touching it. &quot;Landing strained it.
Heated into itself. Didn't want to snap, so it buckled.&quot;

&quot;You seem to know a lot.&quot; Mal turned to her. &quot;You know how to fix it?&quot;

&quot;She knows.&quot; River shrugged casually, but watched him out of the corner of her
eye.

&quot;Well she ain't here.&quot; Mal sighed. &quot;Can't you just...?&quot;

Simon watched Mal gesture at his head and wave his fingers a little. Irritation
and a surge of protectiveness hit him hard and he glared.

&quot;It's not a parlor trick, Captain.&quot;

He felt River's hand on his arm, but she when she spoke it was to Mal.

&quot;She's not here.&quot; She pointed out, using Mal's words against him. &quot;Not thinking
about it. Can't feel through distance.&quot;

&quot;So, we're stuck like this 'til Kaylee gets back?&quot; Jayne saw the various nods
as he clutched his hands under his arm pits, he was beginning to feel the cold
now. &quot;Where's Inara?&quot;

&quot;I called her com, but she didn't answer.&quot; Mal shrugged as he bought his mug to
his lips. &quot;She's probably still asleep, all warm in her shuttle.&quot;

It took about five seconds of them staring at him before Mal clicked.

&quot;Her shuttle! We can sleep in the shuttles 'til the heat's back on.&quot; He quickly
pointed to each member of the crew. &quot;Zoe, River, you can bunk with Inara. Book,
Simon and Jayne with me in shuttle two.&quot;

&quot;You sleep wherever you want, Mal,&quot; Jayne smirked and River smiled with him.
&quot;but I'm goin' with the girls.&quot;

&quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; Simon sighed. &quot;Is it genetic?&quot;

Mal gave a small smile that was too annoyed to become larger.

&quot;Jayne? You'll sleep in shuttle two or off the ship altogether.&quot;

&quot;Third option wins.&quot; They looked at River. &quot;All in one.&quot;

&quot;Girl's right.&quot; Jayne said. &quot;Kaylee circumnavigated the grav seals when she
fixed the shuttle so the sealants would have time to dry. It's running on
Serenity's air. Even if we fix it now, it'd take hours to generate any heat
worth feelin'.&quot;

***

Inara heard the knock and moved to cover herself before she answered it. A wave
of iced air hit her when she opened the door and found herself confronted by a
rather rugged up and shivering crew.

&quot;Hey Inara.&quot; Jayne smirked from the back of the group. &quot;Mal says we all get to
sleep with ya tonight.&quot;

She raised her eyebrows.

&quot;Does he, really?&quot;

***

*She wakes up walking down the corridor, but it's not her. She's never been
here before, doesn't ever want to know where it is. River looks down and sees
bare feet peeking out of standard issue white pajamas. The toes are large and
hairy. It makes her relax.*

*She knows who she is now.*

*The walls are pristine white, as is everything within eyesight, even their
clothes. She imagines that they'll disappear, nothing visible but the brown of
their skin. Feet, hands, neck and face floating disjointed in world of white.
She hears the echoing laughter in his thoughts. He's always loved the literal
in her abstractions.*

*She wants to know why he's bringing her along, wishes she was actually walking
next to him so she can hold his hand. He wants it too. It makes her warm. Out
of all of them, he alone has mastered it, has schooled himself to block it out.
He doesn't let anyone in if he doesn't want to and he only ever seems to want
to with her.*

*The he that is they ignore all the doors with large security pads and screens,
the dressing and disguises, they focus on a neglected door that most people
wouldn't bother looking at. Then again, most people wouldn't be here. Their
hand reaches out and pushes it open.*

*River waits for his eyes to adjust to the light and gasps at what they see. He
wants her to be strong, he wants her to carry this sight, because he suspects
what's coming and he doesn't blame her. Never her.*

*They reach out and touch it, both wishing that it didn't exist, both wanting
it so badly it hurts. How he knows it's there, he'll never let her know, hiding
it in one of the few areas of his brain she hasn't swept through.*

*They use Jonah more than they use her. His secrets are interesting. They don't
know it yet, but her talents are stronger than his. She just hasn't learned to
control it. He's older, larger and infinitely more coherent than she is. They
like that he's male and eagerly push him into the leadership role, which he
assumes quietly and capably. What they don't know is his silent shielding of
her, the way he makes them a team within a team. They lead together.*

*Sometimes River thinks they're scared of her.*

*She feels him agree as they step outside the room and he tells her its name as
they cry together. Not really together. It's against the rules.*

***

Jayne woke up at the sound of her voice. A quick look around the shuttle told
him that everyone else was sleeping. He edged himself forward in the chair as
he looked at her, creaking the aches out of his neck. He cast a baleful glance
at the other women on the bed. Gorram chair just wasn't comfortable. River was
coloring her damned pictures again and Jayne had to wonder if the girl knew she
was crying as he watched her frantic movements.

&quot;You alright?&quot; He approached her carefully.

&quot;Adam.&quot;

She said it to the paper on the table and he realized that it was what she'd
been saying before. He looked at the drawings and furrowed his brow.

&quot;Hey, somethin' wrong with those faces.&quot;

River's hand stilled finally, creating a silence that made him all kinds of
nervous. She looked straight into his eyes and he wished she hadn't, because he
can take her misery when she ain't all there, but when she's all sane it means
she knows what's happening. It made Jayne ache in a way he didn't like. Her
voice hurt his ears, it was that sad.

&quot;Adam.&quot;

***

Wash bucked up the minute they entered the examination room. Kaylee watched in
fascinated horror as orderlies appeared out of nowhere and took his arms,
holding him forcibly still. His face was red with fury as he struggled against
them.

&quot;Katie?&quot; He called out to her, strangled and close to tears. &quot;Don't let them do
this.&quot;

Kaylee knew it was an act, her brain kept reminding her that Wash was playing a
part. They had talked about this, had spent a long time that morning going over
it. Yet she couldn't stop trembling. His act was a little too convincing and
she wanted to stop the whole thing.

She felt Dr. William's hand at the small of her back, offering her comfort. It
wasn't working. She knew she should thank him, give him some sign that his
gesture was appreciated, but she could not take her eyes off Wash.

All she could think as she watched them pull a hypo out of thin air and subdue
him was that it was a good thing that Zoe wasn't there, nor could she read
minds and pull this image from her thoughts. It hit her then, the realization
of just how bad this could get and how many things she would share with Wash
that neither would relate to the whole ship. It scared her a little bit.

A lot, really.

&quot;It's okay.&quot; The doctor spoke softly as Wash was lifted onto the exam table.
&quot;They'll just get him settled. You can visit him tomorrow.&quot;

***

River picked up the wedge of tomato that was on her plate. She held it in
between two fingers of her left hand. The fingernails of her right hand
carefully separated the skin from the flesh, peeling it off as her eyes
scrutinized the result, taking in the tiny fibers that clung to each other and
then tore. She could imagine the screams.

If fruit screamed.

&quot;Colors, huh?&quot; Mal sat opposite her at the table. &quot;What about Jayne?&quot;

&quot;Red.&quot; She bought her wet fingers up to her mouth and licked the juice off
them. &quot;Action. Heat. About the now. Food. Fight. Sex. More food. More sex.&quot;

Mal hid a smile.

&quot;And me?&quot;

&quot;Brown of course.&quot; She rolled her eyes. &quot;Like earth. Grounding. Loyal. Hold it
together. Hold it up. Without you, we drift.&quot;

&quot;And Kaylee?&quot; He teased, trying to ignore the pleased feeling her words gave
him.

&quot;Kaylee's green.&quot; She closed her eyes, a smile drifting on her face. &quot;Nature
and accepting. Fresh.&quot;

At the sound of footsteps, Mal turned to see Inara step into the kitchen and
head for the much overused kettle. He could see the goose bumps on her bare
arms and wished she had the sense to at least borrow a coat if all her robes
were this flimsy. River was already looking at him, still smiling, and answered
before he could even ask.

&quot;Gold. Precious. Immeasurably strong, but oh so malleable.&quot;

***

Dr. Williams sat at his desk when his secretary buzzed his next appointment
through. The man strode into his practice, radiating a confidence the doctor
rarely saw in this clinic or the hospital.

&quot;So?&quot; He asked without bothering to make small talk. &quot;What did you find?&quot;

&quot;Their story checks out.&quot; Was the answer. &quot;Married couple traveling. They're
not staying long. The house they've rented only has a one month lease.&quot;

&quot;The house they've rented?&quot; He put the emphasis on the third word.

&quot;Through a third party. I'm tracing it as we speak.&quot;

&quot;Where is she now?&quot;

&quot;She has a temporary job, that's how she's paying for the house.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot; The doctor pressed his fingers into a steeple in front of him.
&quot;It takes a really cold woman to lock up her husband and then just trip off to
work that afternoon.&quot;

&quot;She cried all the way home.&quot; The man gave a sneer. &quot;Does that make you
happier?&quot;

As a matter of fact, in a perverse way, it did. He thought about the trembling
woman in the hospital only a few hours before and was surprised to find himself
relieved. One thing he really didn't want to do was investigate this need in
him for her to be honest, to prove that she wasn't lying. Especially to him. It
was a dangerous road and he'd traveled it before. But her eyes... No not this
time, not again. The litany rang in his head.

&quot;Good.&quot; He managed to say. &quot;Find out who hired their house and anything else,
no matter how insignificant.&quot;

He pushed some buttons on a small keypad on his desk. The man in front of him
smiled.

&quot;There. The credits have been transferred to your account.&quot;

***

She felt eyes on her when she worked. Kaylee caressed the wheel of a mule,
whispered to it as she sat up. It was a thousand times more powerful and land
worthy than the charred carcass they were hauling on Serenity, but it wasn't
nearly as precious. Not to her. It still deserved attention, though, someone to
tend the small nicks and dents. No one likes neglect.

Her eyes scanned the yard as discreetly as she could manage as she stretched
out in an exaggerated yawn.

&quot;Hey.&quot; She spoke without turning around. &quot;You might as well come out. I can see
you.&quot;

A small gasp and then the two eyes formed a face that peeked out at her from a
cruiser nearby. She smiled at the tiny little person who inched forward,
nervous.

&quot;I'm Kay...&quot; She swallowed and held out her hand. &quot;I'm Katie. And you are?&quot;

&quot;Jessie.&quot; The girl managed with barely a whisper. She couldn't be any more than
ten, Kaylee thought. &quot;George Webber's daughter.&quot;

&quot;Well, guess you know your way around then.&quot; She gestured to the nearby box.
&quot;Why don't you grab a wrench and make yourself useful?&quot;

The girl's eyes widened and Kaylee felt herself smile again. She saw the
hesitation, but also saw the tingle of excitement. It reminded her of herself
when she was young.

&quot;I can't do what you do.&quot; Jessie said. &quot;My daddy says you're magic with these
machines.&quot;

&quot;He does, does he?&quot; Kaylee lay back down and inched herself back under the
engine, letting the girl decide for herself if she wanted to help. &quot;Well, it
ain't nothing. Not really. You get a feel for it.&quot;

&quot;Is that what it is?&quot; Came a deeper voice and Kaylee felt a shudder at the
sound. &quot;I was going to ask you what your secret was.&quot;

She scrambled back out again and saw her new boss standing behind his daughter,
a hand on her shoulder. He was smiling at Kaylee, a perfectly friendly look on
his face. But Kaylee had seen the sudden dismay that had come over the girl
before she smoothed her face and the tightness that stayed there.

&quot;That.&quot; She said. &quot;And a bit of knowledge and practice.&quot;

&quot;I'm surprised.&quot; He continued smiling. &quot;Jessica doesn't talk to many people by
herself.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kaylee's eyes flickered from father to daughter and back again. &quot;It's
okay, though, right? She's allowed to help me?&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Now George grinned and it sent a shiver down Kaylee's spine. &quot;I wouldn't
have it any other way.&quot;

***

Inara smiled softly as her hands lifted the kettle and poured the steaming
water into the pot, every move calculated. She could feel his eyes on her. They
both knew this was an act, a ritual, but formalities must be seen to. Simple
acts that created auras of safety and comfort and boundaries. She made the
performance pleasing to watch and, in return, Dr. Williams was pleased.

She wasn't going to push the conversation towards his work this afternoon, not
unless he did. It would not be prudent to seem too eager and she had let him
know the day before that she was a willing listener to the petty troubles of
his day.

An inner sense born of training and experience told her when the specially
blended herbs had steeped enough and the tea was as good as it was going to
get. Gently, she poured it into two delicate porcelain cups, creating just the
right atmosphere of tinkling liquid. She picked one up, balancing it on the
pads of her fingertips, and offered it to him.

The time it took for him to lean forward and accept it was almost insulting.
Almost. In any other situation, Inara would have had to stifle her annoyance,
but her energies were spent trying not to pounce on the opportunity he had just
given her as a frown crinkled his brows.

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; She lowered her eyes. &quot;It's been too long since I've been able to
restock properly and this is all I have to offer. I really am embarrassed.&quot;

&quot;No. Not at all.&quot; Dr. Williams forced a smile and took a deliberate sip. &quot;It's
wonderful, really, just perfect.&quot;

Of course it's perfect, she thought, it better be perfect for the price paid
for it. She knew there was nothing wrong with her tea, the quality of it nor
the quality of its brewing.

&quot;You're just saying that to be kind.&quot; Blushing on cue is a rare talent. &quot;Thank
you for that.&quot;

&quot;It's I who should apologize.&quot; He pressed a hand onto her knee. &quot;Everything
here is lovely and I'm spoiling it. I just had a tiring morning.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Inara used her own cup to hide the curl of her lips. &quot;Would you like
to talk about it?&quot;

***

There were very few stores in Bellaphron. Hell, there was very few anything.
Just the basics: food supplies, ship repairs, medicines. A tavern. All minimal,
just the essentials and no extras. This was a moon for quick stops, nothing
else.

Mal shuffled up to the man behind the counter, he felt Zoe behind him. His eyes
scanned the paper in his hands and his mouth tried to round out the words,
eventually he thrust the paper at the man.

&quot;We need these.&quot;

If the list that Simon had sent with them was anything different to the usual
requests, the man didn't show it. Not that there was anything suspicious about
the supplies they were getting here, standard antibiotics, vitamin boosters,
immunization, some bandages.

Enough sedatives to drop a whole planet.

&quot;You're from the firefly?&quot; Mal nodded. &quot;Not many people stay longer than they
need to here. You're a bit of a novelty. Although I take it you're not all used
to a moon?&quot;

He eyed the heavy clothing Mal and Zoe wore.

&quot;Our thermo's out.&quot; Mal said. &quot;It'll take a day or so to fix.&quot;

The man gave a sympathetic cringe as he bundled up their order.

&quot;You need a mechanic? I'm it. Can't say we have many firefly compatible parts,
though.&quot;

&quot;You're the mechanic?&quot; Asked Zoe. &quot;I thought you were the doctor.&quot;

&quot;That too.&quot; He said with a laugh. &quot;We're all interchangeable here. Not a lot of
us to go around.&quot;

&quot;We're right.&quot; Mal told him as he counted out the coins. &quot;Got a mechanic and
all the parts. But thanks.&quot;

***

The triplex was a bustling hive of energy, fresh faced people and families
swarming every which way. Kaylee watched them all go about their business of
shopping or entertainment. In her hands she carried a basket with a small
assortment of items bought mostly at random.

She had followed Inara's instructions to the letter, had walked around the
shops, picked up some food supplies, nothing in stores that had long lines.
Keep moving, Inara had told her, don't stay in one place too long, but don't
look as if you're trying to hide anything. Just get lost in the crowds and
don't draw attention.

Truth be told, Kaylee was finding the whole thing a bit daunting. It was a
little too crowded, a little too loud for her. There was too much to keep track
of, things drifted in and out of her sight, snippets of conversation invaded
her ears before being lost again. The day had made her edgy enough as it was,
without being able to get her grounding properly.

She remembered the jolt of fear that the sudden sound of George Webber's voice
gave her, the escalation of her pulse. It bought back memories she really
didn't want and Kaylee tried to reassure herself that there was over a week and
several planets between her and Early's hopefully dead and rotting body.

When she passed a doorway and a hand grabbed her waist, another grabbing her
arm and pulling her into darkness, Kaylee felt her heart freeze. She dug in her
heels and tried to resist as she felt the scream rise on her lips.

&quot;Shh, Mei Mei.&quot; Came a soft voice in her ear. &quot;It's me.&quot;

&quot;Inara!&quot; She breathed in reproach. &quot;Don't do that.&quot;

***

The drugs made him slow. They changed everything, the way he saw things, heard
them, even thought them. He blinked and tried to remember how he got there. The
room was full of people he didn't know.

&quot;You new here?&quot; He thought he heard someone say.

By the time he nodded, the person was gone.

He knew who he was supposed to be, knew what his mind kept telling him. Steven
Hoffman. He had a wife who was waiting for him, counting on him to get well.
His Katie. Something was wrong with it. Something didn't quite gel about his
life, but he couldn't remember anything else.

&quot;You haven't moved for an hour, man, you okay?&quot;

He let his glazed eyes slide over to see a man in a white uniform standing next
to him. A slow nod came again and he shuffled away, scared of the man, of the
place he was in.

***

She oozed into the shuttle, let the familiarity of it seep into her pores.
Kaylee didn't much like the idea of core planets anymore. Her hands touched on
surfaces she'd know anywhere, the metal of the mini ship, her eyes lingered
over the controls she could see in the far corner.

&quot;I'm sorry, Kaylee.&quot; Inara spoke once they were both inside and the door was
closed. &quot;I didn't mean to scare you. We just had to be sure you weren't
followed.&quot;

&quot;Nah.&quot; She brushed over it. &quot;I was just spooked is all. How long 'til we get
there?&quot;

Inara let herself smile over the eagerness.

&quot;Not long, especially if you drive, two hours maybe less.&quot; She hated giving
control of her shuttle to anyone, but Inara could see the sudden ease that
slipped over Kaylee at the suggestion. It may be my shuttle, she thought, but
it's still part of Kaylee's baby. &quot;I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when
we get there. River seems so much better today.&quot;

This was something Kaylee had already suspected, she knew that Inara wouldn't
have hesitated to tell her if anything was really wrong. Her eyes finished
scanning the edges of the room and fell to the table in the middle.

&quot;Inara?&quot; She asked, her brows squinching in suspicion. &quot;Why do you have a
shiny, brand new temp regulator sitting next to a burnt out broken one?&quot;

&quot;Funny story.&quot; Inara said, taking Kaylee by the shoulders and leading her to
the controls. &quot;Apparently the landing was a pretty bumpy one...&quot;

Kaylee whimpered.

***

He was cleaning his knives at the table when Mal found him. Jayne had been
avoiding him all day, he knew something was on the Captain's mind and he had a
fairly good idea as to what it was. Not that sitting in plain view in the
middle of the kitchen area could be considered avoidance anymore, so much as
finally giving in and letting Mal get it out of his system.

&quot;Jayne.&quot; A one word acknowledgement.

&quot;Mal.&quot; A one word answer.

&quot;I'll cut to the chase.&quot; Mal sat down. &quot;Is there gonna be a problem?&quot;

&quot;You don't need to worry.&quot; Jayne turned the blade over and eyed the metal for
any mark or sign of misuse.

&quot;I am worried, though.&quot;

&quot;I heard ya, Mal, you said not now.&quot; Jayne carefully laid the knife down,
nestled it into the others, then looked up to meet Mal's eyes. &quot;Which means
maybe later. Knowin' you, it means ya already plannin' something.&quot;

&quot;Maybe. Maybe not. But I'm giving you a choice.&quot; To Jayne, Mal's voice didn't
sound like it was much of a choice at all. &quot;When we leave this rock you can
stay here if you want an' no words said about it. But you choose to stay on
this ship, then you're no longer a hired gun and nothing more. You're crew and
everyone on board is your crew. Tight as a family. Dong ma?&quot;

Jayne nodded, but didn't speak.

&quot;I don't need to be worryin' about anyone ratting this ship out to the feds or
other, no matter how much money is offered.&quot;

He thought about River that morning, the way she'd looked at him, the way she'd
talked so matter of factly the night before about things that no one should
have to go through. He thought about Simon, the grudging respect he'd earned
lately. About the rest of the people on board he already reckoned as crew. No,
Jayne silently agreed with himself, it wasn't much of a choice at all.

&quot;I said ya don't have to worry, Mal.&quot;

***

&quot;You're scared.&quot; River said lightly to the empty room as she snuggled under
blankets. &quot;Don't be, I won't bite.&quot;

&quot;I'm not scared.&quot;

The second before she looked up to see Simon standing in the doorway to her
room, River felt a sudden, cruel and unreasonable hope. He'd sounded so much
like the old Simon, the brother that no longer was. Younger then than she was
now. All bravado, trying to prove his emerging maleness to a sister who'd just
made him scream.

Back when love was simple and each other and not tinged with sacrifice and
screams and pride and fruitless trying. Stupid, really. All things gone. That
was now and this is then and even that wasn't quite right. She sat up and
shivered in the cold air.

&quot;You're always scared, Simon.&quot; She blinked, tried to find the little boy in the
man with words uttered long ago. &quot;Little boy in big men's clothes.&quot;

It took an instant for her words to cut through the tangles of his thoughts.
The gibe had all but been lost in his memories of her. A nervous smile teased
his lips as he welcomed the sparkle that lit up her eyes. His chest puffed out
and he drew himself up to his full height.

&quot;I'm bigger than you.&quot; It was all too easy to fall back into the role.

&quot;That's only anatomy.&quot; She stood up, poked a thin finger into the sides of his
ribs and giggled as he had to release the air from his lungs. &quot;Air and smoke
and mirrors.&quot;

&quot;You'll pay for that.&quot;

The sudden look in Simon's eyes told her exactly what he meant by that and she
didn't even need to scan him to feel the relief washing over him, the fun
taking over. He was about to ask a question he'd forgotten since she went away,
the very question she'd been both waiting for and dreading on board the ship.
All these months.

&quot;Simon.&quot; She warned, a hand up to ward him off, but he just grinned at her
wide, wide eyes.

&quot;Are you still ticklish, River?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She told him as she shook her head, but her stance was already set to run
and she couldn't stop the grin. &quot;Never have been.&quot;

&quot;Liar!&quot; He accused and reached out for the sensitive skin of her waist. &quot;You
always were.&quot;

&quot;Was not!&quot;

She squealed a giggle as he made contact and twisted out of his reach, her feet
carrying her out of the room, flushed and happy. Simon stood still for a
second, letting it sink in, enjoying the moment, then he ran after her.

He saw her leaning against the stairs leading up from the common room. As their
eyes met, she took off again. There was no doubt in his mind that she could
outrun him in seconds and stay hidden for hours on the ship if that was what
she wanted. But it wasn't. She wanted to be caught.

&quot;Were too!&quot; He called, his hand slapping on the wall for balance as he turned a
corner. &quot;Still are!&quot;

&quot;Am not!&quot;

Her voice came from the dining area and he stopped short when he saw Mal and
Jayne sitting there staring at him. He knew his face was red and at that moment
he just didn't care.

&quot;River run through here?&quot;

&quot;Not a one, nor ponds or lakes.&quot; Mal spoke seriously, but there was humor in
his eyes. &quot;Or natural water sources of any kind.&quot;

&quot;We got a tap of tank water if ya want.&quot; Was Jayne's helpful suggestion.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Simon kept on walking through. He knew she hadn't gone back the way he'd came,
so that left the bunks and the bridge. A sudden screeching of wood on the floor
made him turn. A flash of color jumped up from behind the couches and ran back
out to the stairs.

&quot;Was she here the whole time, Jayne?&quot; Mal said with large, innocent eyes.

&quot;Musta been, Mal.&quot; Replied Jayne with the same wide eyes.

Simon spared them a glare as he ran after her.

&quot;I'll get you, you know.&quot;

He took the stairs at a slide, his hands gliding down the rails. It was an act,
River had tried to explain to him once, that she would never, could never do.
She didn't like to ignore the stairs themselves, they did such a good job
holding her up. That suited him just fine, it gave him time to catch up.

&quot;Will not!&quot;

She had just reached the infirmary when he caught her, hand out to grab around
her waist and pulling her towards the couches. She twisted, doubling over in
giggles, hair flying out around them.

&quot;Just did!&quot;

River squealed again, bathed herself in his forgotten youth. This was her
brother. Simon. Gleeful in a way they taught him not to be. They laughed
before. They could laugh again. River couldn't stop herself from bubbling up,
laughter pouring out like milk. They could never go back, too many glass shards
to cover, but now they could go forward.

Simon felt himself laughing, struggling to get to her ticklish sides as she
pushed back at him, each knowing from memory where the other's most sensitive
spots were. He felt her go still suddenly, limp and bringing her arms in close
to her body. Her eyes shone when she looked up at him, more so than they had
moments before.

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; She whispered, panting with the effort of laughter.

He was left leaning over an empty sofa as she slipped out of his grasp and ran
towards the incoming shuttle.

***

Kaylee let her eyes slide over the shape of Serenity as they approached. Many
times she had found herself missing her folks, but this she knew was real
homesickness. The little knot of tension that had formed in her belly two days
ago began to loosen as Zoe's voice confirmed their landing.

&quot;I bought a cake, Inara.&quot; She eased the shuttle into its port, ears already
pricked for the hissing of the landing, the shifting of gears. &quot;A real one. You
gonna join us?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don't think so, Kaylee.&quot; She looked up in surprise at the weary sigh of
Inara's voice. &quot;Not right now. You'll save me some, though, won't you?&quot;

&quot;Course I will.&quot; She frowned slightly and turned away from the controls. &quot;You
okay?&quot;

Now that she was actually looking at Inara, Kaylee felt a jolt of concern. The
woman looked tired and worn down and this alone made her nervous. Years of
strict training ensured that Inara rarely, if ever, let any signs of weakness
through, not even with Serenity's crew. She kept a strict regime of appearing
serene and in control.

&quot;I'm okay, Mei Mei.&quot; Inara smiled in reassurance. &quot;I just have a lot of things
that need to be done before everyone wants to sleep tonight.&quot;

The concern turned into a sudden rush of guilt. The whole trip Kaylee had been
thinking about herself and Wash, River, the absolute distance between Orpheus
and Serenity, Mal and Simon. She hadn't thought about the impact it was having
on Inara.
