Congradulations to Ducati, the first non-Japanese manufacturer to win the top GP racing class constructors title since 1973.

Casey is certainly having quite the season!

Before anyone chimes in about the bike tire advantage, remember it's no more then Valentino had entering the first MotoGP season. Which leads to a question...

Could Valentino never win another championship(?) and if so, will it diminish his legacy?

Could be, but only if he doesn't last that much longer and continues to
have luck go against him. Right now it's hard to say that he doesn't
remain the best out there, and he certainly hasn't lost his
stature-based advantages in the series. That he's been beaten by an
American and an Australian rider the last couple years plays to his
advantage, it's not like it's been Pedrosa beating him. But as long as
he's at Yamaha he runs the risk of being down on bike, no matter how
hard they try to please him. And the midget thing on these 800s runs
against him as much as anyone. Well, not really, as his factory will
never build the bike to fit others.

His legacy has already taken a hit the the last two years, at least with
those who thought he simply couldn't be beaten, that he could win on any
bike, on any tires. That silly notion is dead now, thankfully, but for
anyone with a real-world view, the last two years haven't done much at
all to diminish him. The biggest hit remains his crash at Valencia last
year, which still looks like a momentous misjudgment with the
championship on the line and he holding most of the cards.

Forza Ducati. Good stuff. They utterly and totally did the right stuff.

By the way - is it widely known that one of the main engineering talents in
Ducati is a guy in a wheelchair, who lost it is a moto rallye in northern
Africa? Utmost and total respect.

I think Stoner was in a more unique situation than Rossi has been. Let
Stoner switch teams to Yamaha next year and win it, and then we will talk...

He's got enough of them for his legacy to be pretty safe. I do think he
should try to move away from Yamaha, though.

To me, it's quite visible that Rossi doesn't ride quite as hard as he did in
his inspired, against all odds win with Yamaha that first year he was
battling superior Honda machines while really putting it out there. I don't
blame him - what's the motiviation now, after so many title and on the same
brand?

Ultimately, as long as they are there, they all have something to prove.
Both Stoner and Hayden have to prove their titles weren't coincidcental
flukes, and Rossi has to remind people why he was regarded as such a unique
riding talent (I believe Stoner is another one in his league, though).

...pablo

PS: And before I get accused of anti-Hayden bias - Hayden is a phenomenal
rider, but he is different from the Rossi-Stoner school. He is a swiss watch
as a rider, accurate and consistent. Hayden and Pedrosa are conservative
riders that will never incur more risks than necessary and paid for. Stoner
and Rossi will incur lunacy. Bless them.

True enough.

Or let's wait until Rossi changes bike AND tire manufacturers at the
same time and wons the championship right off - has anyone done that
before? Then throw in that Stoner didn't arrive as the messiah with
everyone responding to his every word, or with his team of guys that
know what he likes and wants.

Why? To where?

Doesn't really look that obvious to me. This year Rossi has been in a
position where he has no chance of winning quite often, and he has spent
precious little time over his career in that position. You could see
that in the post-race interview yesterday, knowing he couldn't run with
Stoner, and in the end not even Capirossi. Welcome to the real world, Vale.

I think Rossi may have to do more than just remind people, he may have
to truly establish that. Don't get me wrong, I think he still does
enough to lay claim to being the best, but part of what I think we're
seeing on the other end of the spectrum is what it's like to compete
when you don't have the edge in almost every respect, including the
psychological advantage. In the past when we've witnessed Rossi
miracles, he not only had the mental edge that always doing it provides,
but he had the stuff to do it, usually the best bike and always the best
tires.

Don't forget that when he went to Yamaha, that was also when the Honda
ran into it's chatter problems, and the best riders at Honda weren't on
the factory team. So I don't really accept that Rossi was so far down on
bike, and in fact Honda changed their design parameters after that,
recognizing that the 211 wasn't nimble enough. And of course Rossi was
running the &quot;Yamaha tire&quot; then, which was causing havoc at Honda. And
those Michelin &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot; didn't just start when
Bridgestone became a truly serious challenger, rather Riossi got bailed
out on occasion when it was other Michelin guys who challenged him.
It's good to be Vale.

As for Pedrosa and Hayden, I think you're generalizing on very thin
evidence. Hayden isn't that much of a crasher (in the dry, anyway), but
neither have any of the great champions been that. Beyond that, I think
you're making assumptions based on the fact that Hayden didn't win many
races last year but finished on the podium a lot. What seems clear to me
about that is that he was a guy who had a bike that didn't work all that
well much of the time, good but not great, but he also had a
championship lead to protect. And you have to have the bike to really
fight at the front, and it doesn't seem to me that he's had that a lot
the last couple years. Estoril and Valencia last year, yes, but then it
didn't play out for him to do so.

Pedrosa gets a lot of his edge from his size, and that also plays out as
a disadvantage. What that likely means is that he'll rarely fight it out
the way people have loved about Rossi, because when things play his was
he doesn't need to, and when they don't he can't. As long as he's on the
factory Honda, expect to see him doing a lot of draft passing down
straights, because he's got an edge there. Muscling the bike past guys
in corners? Are you kidding? Why do it when you can just wait until you
get to the straight. That doesn't mean he won't stick his nose in there
from time to time and get it slapped, of course (as he did in the Honda
hairpin yesterday).

I think impossible to really say about Stoner, since he's had such an
edge this year. To this point he's led 241 laps, 58% of the laps this
year, and that's more laps led than anyone else in MotoGP history, with
Rossi's high being 210 in 2003. In Stoner's nine wins he's essentially
gone wire-to-wire six times, leading every lap - Philip Island, Misano,
Brno, Laguna, Istanbul, Losail - and in China he trailed only the first
lap. In the other two race wins, he took over at about halfway at
Donington in the rain and led the rest of the way, and the only time
he's had a dual to the end was with Rossi in Barcelona. In his losses,
he never led at Jerez and Le Mans, he led the first three laps at
Mugello and faded from there, he led most of the way at Assen but fell
to Rossi over the last four laps, in Germany he never led and faded late
with bad tires, at Estoril he led early slipped to third and stayed
there the rest of the way, and at Motegi he led one lap early on before
fading again.

So what I see there is a guy who rams it down there throats when he's
got the edge, but who hasn't shown quite the ability or the will to take
the fight to them when he doesn't. Now that is likely in large part the
same reason why Hayden didn't last year, he's had a championship lead to
protect and isn't going to push to the point of crashing and throwing
that away. So the difference between them may mostly be that Stoner has
had the best bike/tire combination out there in half the races, but
Hayden may never have had that last year. On the other hand, one wonders
if Rossi has really learned the lesson of well-advised conservatism yet,
as he's never had to in the past. It might be interesting to see how he
reacts if he's in a season-long close fight next year.
