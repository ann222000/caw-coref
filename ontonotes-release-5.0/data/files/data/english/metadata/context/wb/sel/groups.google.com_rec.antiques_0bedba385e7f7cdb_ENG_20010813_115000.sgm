O.K., you just bought several items from an estate. You paid the
agreed upon price and you are happy. Good stuff, good deal. Back at the
shop you pull these things out of boxes and start pricing them. After
you've done this the original owner comes in the shop and sees what
prices you've put on things. And they are shocked. What do you say?

"/> Well, since you paid the price asked, I don't think you need say anything
at all!
Coincidentally to this question, one of our mall-dealer friends just gave
us a
copy of a recent Harry Rinker column, (&quot;Rinker on Collectibles&quot;) from the
July 30th AntiqueWeek - Eastern edition, in which he presents a sliding
scale of &quot;fair purchase price&quot;, starting at 20 percent for items less than
$100; 25% for values between $100 and $1000, and so on, maxing out at 35%
on items over $10,000. I don't care all that much for Rinker generally,
but it seems to me that he hits the nail on the head in this area!

"/>&quot;Thank you&quot; ??

This is why I prefer to buy at auction. Okay. Try to explain....

Perhaps you could have sold these things for the price I've got them
marked at (maybe not) but you would have to rent and decorate and fill
and staff a store, and buy and read reference books on many different
subjects, buy tags, and clean and sort the stuff, and keep proper
books, and register with the sales tax people, and get cards printed,
and advertise, and deal with the public, and.....

This is what I *do* for a living. Maybe I'll sell some of these
things, maybe even most of them. Maybe I won't sell any for a while,
during which time you still have my money, and I still have the
expenses of running my *business*.

I guess I would express shock at the original owner's resurrection.
Estate sales, at least in Arizona, imply that the original owner is well
beyond caring about current prices.

"/> Tina,

Funny you brought this up today. I had an ebay buyer come and pick up a piece
of glass today. We live in the same area, and she has bought from me before.
We discussed glass for over an hour, brought out the books, which she had never
looked at before, and made mental notes of what she collects. I was showing
her some of the items (pictures) that I had sold over the past year, which are
attached to a ledger which lists the items, what I bought them for, sold them
for, ebay's take and the profit. She was floored that I could take a 50 cent
yard sale purchase, research it, and turn it into $50. Some people seem to
think this is &quot;magic&quot; money! Money that appears from thin air. Tina, you went
to that estate sale as a buyer, not an appraiser. You had a head full of
knowledge that you earned by spending your time researching things in advance.
It was no accident that you chose each of your purchases, and paid the agreed
price. NO GUILT THERE! I would probably also feel awkward in that situation,
but this is your business! What did they expect - to walk into your shop and
find these items listed for what you paid for them? Or less? So give, what
did you say? How did you handle it? Now that my ebay buyer knows what I pay
for things, she suggested that I call her before I list an item she collects -
should I? (I'm such a doormat I probably will) This is what happens when you
let them &quot;look behind the curtain&quot;!

Thanks for all the replies. It happened (again) yesterday, but my
partner was there and she felt uncomfortable, but didn't say anything to the
folks who were talking about the prices to each other. But since it happens
every so often I wondered what you guys would suggest. I usually say that
the item might sit there a long time and leave it at that. The trick comes
when you hope to keep buying from these folks. I have a couple that brings
me things a few at a time....great stuff and I'm anxious to have a crack at
the mother load when they finally move. But I haven't let them see my
previous purchases from them. I have been fair, but there are healthy
mark-ups on these things and I don't want the sweet couple to feel ripped
off. I am lucky...I have two shops so I can &quot;hide&quot; things. But it's a game.
One way we've dealt with this is to stop making offers. They must state
a price and then we go from there. That way it's clear that we aren't
ripping anyone off. If folks insist on us setting a price I'll say &quot;Well,
we'll probably sell that for $100.00 which puts us buying it at $30.00. That
way they are not surprised to see that mark-up. But some folks understand
that business must make profit and some folks just see you taking grannies
stuff.
You not only have to BE honest, you have to LOOK honest.

Tina - I seem to be buying from haunted estates!

because they are afraid that one day someone could have walked through the
door and found a piece they sold to a low end dealer, who sold it for 4
times that to a not-quite-that-low-end dealer, who doubled his money, when
he sold it on to another dealer, etc. I guess a good piece may wander
through 5 or 6 dealers before it ends up at the top of the food chain. At
least in Norway, anyway. The first 4 sellers would probably all have a
heart-attack if they saw the final price.

Beside, if you don't display the prices it is much easier to sell, because
you get to talk to people.

I had sent a follow-up post to this thread, but it seems to have
vanished ( I suspect I hit the wrong button). I wanted to thank folks for
the replies. The situation happened the other day to my partner and she
was uncomfortable, which led to my asking you guys for ideas, but it has
happened before and likely will again. My approach is usually to say
something like &quot;Oh, that may sit here a long time. We'll have to see.&quot; and
leave it at that, but it gets tricky. Just now I have an older couple
that's bringing me a few items at a time. The things they have are great
and I'm anxious to get a crack at the mother-load of stuff when they
finally move. In the mean time I have some items they have sold me. I was
fair with them, but the prices show a healthy mark-up. Since I don't want
these folks to feel ripped off I have been 'hiding' these things at my
other shop. That's a luxury I have now, but in the past I've sent some
things to yabe rather than have sellers be put off.
I have dealt with this by not making offers anymore. Sellers need to
set a price and then we can talk. If they insist I set a price I say
something like &quot;Well, I will sell this for about $100.00 which puts me
buying it for about $30.00. That way they know what to expect. Of course,
then the problem comes when you take that $30.00 purchase home, do some
research and fine out it's worth $300.00. Now you've got that sweet old
couple thinking you're a snake.
Oh well, if it was easy anybody could do it. ;-)

Tina - these estates I'm buying from seem to be haunted!

P.S. I HATE shops without prices...but then I'm just not a posh sort.

Tina, I think you just have to be up-front about it.
All you can say is &quot;This is what I'll pay you for it,
and I'll have to price it higher, of course, to allow
some profit when I sell it. Normally, I pay about
50% of what I think it will sell for, BUT I have to
mark it higher than that because everyone wants
a discount at an antique shop, which they'd never
ask for at Nordstrom.&quot;

It's amazing that most people don't realize that *all*
retailers have to mark up their items, to stay in
business and allow a profit.

People act shocked if they hear that Nordstrom's
marks everything up 100% - like they're stealing
or something.

Everyone here is probably sick of my story, but
just in case:
An antique shop owner in Utah bought some things
from a woman. Fairly nice things, including a piece
of glass that she gave the women $100 for. A
couple of weeks later, the woman returned to the
shop and noticed that the glass piece was marked
$220. The woman left, then returned (accompanied
by the police). She told the police that the antique
store had robbed her, because she was trying to
sell the item for more than she'd been paid. The
policeman started laughing, and had to give his
first speech on retailing.

I don't think you hit the wrong button - just another case of the sometimes
disappearing news items. Your (almost) identical post appears on my
newsreader
with a dateline of Monday, 13 August, while this one is dated Wednesday!! See

also Jon's note above - he saw Marshall's comment on Ronnies post, but not
Ronnies post itself. It seems to happen all the time.

Anyway, your story, and Kris' really show how ill-informed the public can be.
On the other hand some folks are weird in the other direction. We regularly
buy things from one customer who insists that we only pay her the price she
had paid originally, despite the fact that the items are worth considerably
more today! Go figure!

I have to say that when I go to a shop or show where items have no prices I
assume they are out of my price range, so I look around and leave. This may
or not be true, but I find it discouraging that a shop or booth at a show
doesn't give me, as a shopper, a baseline on which to base the general level
of merchandise they carry.

As an example, I was at a show and saw a lovely pair of brass candlesticks.
They were not marked with a price. I talked to the dealer (who was very nice)
and found out they were American, mid 1700s, and way beyond my means. As a
result, the dealer spent her time unproductively because I could never afford
them, and I would have know that if they were marked.

I understand that making personal contact with a shopper can make a
difference in a sale, but sometimes it is a waste of time for the dealer and
the shopper.

With regard to the original poster's problem, I have worked in grocery
stores, gourmet food stores and gift shops. If the general public knew what
their cherished Hallmark limited edition Christmas ornaments cost wholesale
they would spit. This is the reality of the retail business. You buy low and
sell high or you close your doors.

"/> I agree with the points you make. However time is something you usually
have a lot of when your working in an antique shop. I don't know how it is
in the US, but here, even a shop in Oslo with top location will normally
have somewhere between 10 and 20 visits a day.

Furthermore I think too much focus these days are on the price of a piece.
That is what people watch the Antique Roadshow and similar programs - and
the result is a lot of really irritating bargain hunters. These days
everyone expect to find a Monet in the addict and a Delft Garniture in a
garagesale. The result is that a very high percentage of those who have an
interest in antiques end up spending all their money on junk.

It is particularly annoying on antique fairs. You can spot the bargain
hunters a mile away. The head straight for the messiest stalls where they
look at everything, because they don't care what they buy as long as it is
dead cheap. And should they by chance walk past a good display, they will
check one piece, see that it is clean and correctly marked, and then just
shake their empty heads in disbelief (some drop the head-shaking and in
stead gives you an angry look or yells &quot;idiot&quot; at you).

I have found that dropping the price tags will normally discourage most of
these. And if not, when they ask you can just look at their clothes in a
surprised manner, raise one eyebrow and smile forgivingly.

Then again, of course, I go bargain hunting too. That is how I make a
living. I guess the only difference is that I don't see buying antiques as
a substitute for playing bingo, but rather try to make a profit from the
more stable percentages.

&gt;This is why you shouldn't display the prices - just the details of the
&gt;piece. None of the posh shops uses stickers, and I think it is mainly
&gt;because they are afraid that one day someone could have walked through the
&gt;door and found a piece they sold to a low end dealer, who sold it for 4
&gt;times that to a not-quite-that-low-end dealer, who doubled his money, when
&gt;he sold it on to another dealer, etc. I guess a good piece may wander
&gt;through 5 or 6 dealers before it ends up at the top of the food chain. At
&gt;least in Norway, anyway. The first 4 sellers would probably all have a
&gt;heart-attack if they saw the final price.

will not buy from them.

Sorry, I pushed the wrong button (again) and sent this to the wrong place.

I loved your comment about looking at their clothes and then raising an
eyebrow. Maybe it is different in the U.S. but it is not unusual for those
with money to look like a charity case. I have tried to judge people's
buying capabilities but find it is almost impossible to go by their
clothing. Most women I know carry Coach purses (a fairly expensive designer
brand) that they have purchased at garage sales for about $5.00 but they
would be hard pressed to &quot;find two nickels to rub together&quot;. (an old merkin
saying).

&gt;&gt; I have to say that when I go to a shop or show where items have no
prices
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; assume they are out of my price range, so I look around and leave. (...)

&gt; I agree with the points you make. However time is something you usually
&gt; have a lot of when your working in an antique shop. I don't know how it
is
&gt; in the US, but here, even a shop in Oslo with top location will normally
&gt; have somewhere between 10 and 20 visits a day.

&gt; Furthermore I think too much focus these days are on the price of a piece.
&gt; That is what people watch the Antique Roadshow and similar programs - and
&gt; the result is a lot of really irritating bargain hunters. These days
&gt; everyone expect to find a Monet in the addict and a Delft Garniture in a
&gt; garagesale. The result is that a very high percentage of those who have
an
&gt; interest in antiques end up spending all their money on junk.

&gt; It is particularly annoying on antique fairs. You can spot the bargain
&gt; hunters a mile away. The head straight for the messiest stalls where they
&gt; look at everything, because they don't care what they buy as long as it is
&gt; dead cheap. And should they by chance walk past a good display, they will
&gt; check one piece, see that it is clean and correctly marked, and then just
&gt; shake their empty heads in disbelief (some drop the head-shaking and in
&gt; stead gives you an angry look or yells &quot;idiot&quot; at you).

&gt; I have found that dropping the price tags will normally discourage most of
&gt; these. And if not, when they ask you can just look at their clothes in a
&gt; surprised manner, raise one eyebrow and smile forgivingly.

&gt; Then again, of course, I go bargain hunting too. That is how I make a
