Do you use an inverter or does yours work off 12 volts?  If it works on
12 volts, can you let me know the make/model number and also, if you
know, what voltage it drops out at? If you have info that may be
pertinent to the topic, please share.

TIA,

Tom

I've been using a cheap RS inverter for about 4 1/2 years now.  IIRC,
Remstar + will take 12V @ 3A max.  I never thought of making up a 12V
supply, but I guess I should.  It would save some of the battery power lost
through the inverter.

Mine runs off 12v or 115v, or off an inverter on 115v.  If you run it
off the 12v plug, the humidifier isn't powered up.  Running the
humidifier and cpap on an inverter will pretty much take a group 27
true deep cycle down to where it needs to be recharged every day.  Two
6 volts in series will just about make it 2 nights, but will pretty
well kill them.

Mine is the Remstar model 1018846.  The pump draws 1 amp AC and 3 amps
DC, (using the $50 12 volt cord they sell).  The 12v cord will not run
the humidifier.  The humidifier pulls 1.7 amps AC.  The humidifier
won't run off the 12 vdc cord.

2.7amps AC is about 27 amps dc.  A 300 watt inverter will be straining
to run it.  A 450 watt will do it better, but there is the issue of
the cooling fan on the inverter, find a quite one.

I've gone 4 nights in the summer (no heater at night) with no issues. I've
never run a humidifier though (home or away). Sleep well and quietly though.
My inverter is in the truck center box most of the time, goes into the Fox
only when traveling.  It doesn't have a fan, nothing fancy except a high
pitched beeeeeep when input voltage drops to 11V or so, give or take 1/2V.
It is about 8&quot; x 1 1/2&quot; x 4&quot;.

That's what some friends of mine use, for two CPAP (they also tent
camp!!)

Thanks to all that replied and extra thanks particularly for the detail
of model number.

Mine is the RemStar PlusLX Model No.1000921. It plugs into the RV wall
socket and runs off the inverter OR off battery power when boondocking. If
tenting, it has an accessory plug that connects it to a deep cycle trolling
motor without the humidifier will run 3 days on the trolling battery without
requiring recharging. Another adapter will let the accessory plug fit into
the car's cigarette lighter. Voltage dropoff, if any, does not affect
performance.

Good luck!
John
