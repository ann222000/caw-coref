What is the size of the axle nut for a 2002 TJ?  I assume it is 36mm
but am not sure.  After my friend snapped the u-joint I would like to
carry the tools to remove the parts on the trail.

You are correct.

There is no need to touch that axle nut unless you are replacing the hub
or it's pressed in bearings.

It 'can' allow the hub to separate even.  I have seen that two or three
times lately when called in for help.  In one case, the hub had to be
replaced, the bearings got wrecked when he tried to compress it back
together using the axle nut.

The whole hub and spindle and axle pull out as one piece and you just
change the u-joint behind it so you just need the brake caliper 'wrench
or tool' and the socket for the 3 hub flange bolts and a BFH to get it
moving the first time.  I carry a spare bolt to use with the BFH to
pound on for stuck ones.

I have a 3/4&quot; old socket that works well for tapping out the old u-joint
also.

The last front one I had to do on my Cherokee took an hour including
going to get the parts. (noticed it just before going camping, that time
I sunk the Cherokee up to the lights in the 'puddle' I think)

It is a 36 mm anyway to answer your question.

You may also want to carry a tie bar end puller.  I had to remove the
tie bar to get a good swing at the hub flange bolts to get the hub to
come out.  If you want to avoid the trouble on the trail, you could do
the job at home and put anti-seize on everything to make sure it comes
out easily when needed.

I have managed to get clearance by cutting the steering side to side for
each.  The bottom one worked easiest with the steering cut so it's an
open swing from the front with the BFH.
