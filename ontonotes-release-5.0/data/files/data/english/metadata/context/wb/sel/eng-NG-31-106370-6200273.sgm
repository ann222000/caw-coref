Hi all,

What video is public domain?
Or perhaps I should ask, what content is usable without royalty?

Are any of these?
1. George W Bush speeches and meet-the-press briefings
2. Other public officials in the US
3. Non-US public officials' speeches
4. The George W Bush giving the middle finger video ("victory finger")
5. Video content recorded from CSPAN
6. Movies whose copyright was obtained over 40 years ago?
7. Can I use withou royalty clips of mainstream movies less than 10
seconds?

Thanks.

All of these are owned by the person making the video.  While the event
may be in the public domain, the video is not.

Any of those, where you were lucky enough to be in the audience with a
camera will be yours to use, otherwise, it belonds to who ever recorded
or broadcast it.

Content which was produced by the US government

Other content which is marked as "public domain"

Copyright-protected content which is so old that the

yet?

Easy enough to look up the current law to see when the

arbitrary number to me.  Note that copyright terms have
been changing lately due to recent legislation such as
that purchased by the Disney organization, etc. They are
longer than you think, way longer than 40 years.

For what?  There are specific defenses to copyright

you is "no" without knowing more about what your
intended use is.

Everything Richard says is true.  I would point out, however, that there is
a rather huge library of public domain video and audio material at

Wrong.  There is no magic threshhold amount of infringement, below which it
is legal to copy.

And acknowledging someone else's copyright merely means you've admitted to
intentional copyright infringement and are subject to much higher liability.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Do you think that somehow the content changes the rules?

It can, under very rare circumstances.  Courts have acknowledged in dicta
(meaning a non-binding opinion) something which has come to be known as the
Zapruder Doctrine.  It applies to film and/or video that is of events of
such historic importance that medium of the expression becomes the
expression itself.  The classic example given is the Zapruder film of the
Kennedy assassination.  It is noteworthy not only for what it captures, but
for the fact of its having been made, being the only film that records the
actual moment of assassination, etc.

I am unaware of any case in which the Zapruder doctrine has been
successfully raised as a defense to infringement.  I have, however, recently
advised a client who wanted to use a short piece of someone else's footage
in a documentary that I believed the Zapruder doctrine should apply (sorry,
can't discuss details).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably. But do note with the clip to whom the copyright belongs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or at least your source of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And you were doing so well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong.  There is no magic threshhold amount of infringement, below which
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is legal to copy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And acknowledging someone else's copyright merely means you've admitted
&gt;&gt;&gt; to intentional copyright infringement and are subject to much higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; liability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Purely my personal opinion. I am not a copyright attorney let alone any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of attorney.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Keep saying that and we won't have a problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To the OP: I am a copyright attorney.

&gt;&gt; Is it also true that in every copyright case there are at least two
&gt;&gt; opposing attorney's who think they are right...and one almost always
&gt;&gt; loses?

&gt; It depends.  I defend two kinds of cases.  Those in which I think the
&gt; facts and the law favor my client and those in which I think they don't.
&gt; When they don't, I try to settle the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What video is public domain?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or perhaps I should ask, what content is usable without royalty?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are any of these?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. George W Bush speeches and meet-the-press briefings

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Only if you recorded them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;meet the press&quot; briefings are copyrighted by the media presenting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Other public officials in the US
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Non-US public officials' speeches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The George W Bush giving the middle finger video (&quot;victory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finger&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. Video content recorded from CSPAN

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All of the above are copyrighted by those that recorded the events.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Close, but not quite.  There can be copyright in the speech, itself, of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a non-public official.  Some of the material aired by C-SPAN is also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subject to copyright protection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Movies whose copyright was obtained over 40 years ago?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Copyright still may be in effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. Can I use withou royalty clips of mainstream movies less than 10
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seconds?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably. But do note with the clip to whom the copyright belongs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or at least your source of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And you were doing so well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong.  There is no magic threshhold amount of infringement, below
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which it is legal to copy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And acknowledging someone else's copyright merely means you've admitted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to intentional copyright infringement and are subject to much higher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Purely my personal opinion. I am not a copyright attorney let alone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any kind of attorney.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Keep saying that and we won't have a problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To the OP: I am a copyright attorney.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it also true that in every copyright case there are at least two

&gt; with lack of specifics, facts become amorphous.

When I file an infringement action, it is because the facts and the law
support my client.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 requires that.  I have no idea what
you mean when you say the area if fraught with lack of specifics.   That's
certainly not my (considerable) experience in this field.
