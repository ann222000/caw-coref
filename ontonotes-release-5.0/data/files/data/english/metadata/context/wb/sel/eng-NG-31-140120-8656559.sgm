In a move that should immediately help their floundering bullpen and
could eventually provide a boost to their rotation, the Giants on
Saturday recalled right-hander Brian Wilson from Triple-A Fresno and
sent down lefty Jonathan Sanchez.

&quot;This was a case of wanting to get Wilson up, and it gives us a chance
to get Sanchez consistent work,&quot; manager Bruce Bochy said. &quot;We think a
lot of (Sanchez), and he's going to be a very good major-league
pitcher.&quot;

The club hopes Sanchez, who was 1-2 with a 5.30 ERA and 43 strikeouts
in 352/3 innings of relief, will log a number of minor-league innings
in a relaxed environment, and Bochy said Sanchez could get some
starts, much like he did at the end of last season.

The Giants also think highly of Wilson, a hard-thrower who is
considered by some the closer of the future. In fact, there were times
when the future appeared to be now.

He allowed five hits and no runs while earning 11 saves in his first
14 winter-ball innings but struggled with his command during spring
training and was among the final cuts for the Opening Day roster.
Wilson managed to use his disappointment to spur a comeback in
Triple-A, compiling a 1-2 record and 11 saves with a 2.10 ERA and 37
strikeouts in 341/3 innings.

&quot;With that kind of stuff, I don't let it drag on with me,&quot; Wilson
said. &quot;I take out that aggression on the mound. I release that anger
and use that adrenaline when I'm pitching. You can't mope around and
expect to pitch well.&quot;

Wilson was the lone bright spot from the bullpen Saturday, throwing a
scoreless eighth inning. Three other Giants relievers (Kevin Correia,
Steve Kline and Randy Messenger) combined to allow seven runs in two
innings.

&quot;(Wilson) has been throwing the ball well, and it's obvious that we
need some help late in the ball game,&quot; Bochy said.

Once in a lifetime: After a ninth-inning, pinch-hit infield single
Friday, Dave Roberts was removed for a pinch-runner for the first time
in his life. Roberts, who has 229 career stolen bases, was removed for
pitcher Noah Lowry.

&quot;Lowry is better and faster,&quot; Bochy joked. &quot;No, it was about Roberts'
knee. He actually got down the line better than I thought he would,
but he wasn't well enough to leave him out there.&quot;

Roberts injured his right knee sliding into home plate a day earlier
and is expected to be available only in a pinch-hitting role until
Monday.

Lowry replaced Roberts again Saturday, after Roberts' bases-loaded,
pinch-hit walk in the seventh.

Briefly: Bochy said Lowry will start the second game of Monday's
doubleheader in Pittsburgh, leaving Tuesday's starter undecided. ...
Bochy said Pat Misch, who was optioned to Fresno on Friday to clear
room for Russ Ortiz, will continue to pitch in a starting role.

When I went out to lunch, the Giants were behind by 6 runs and had a
couple of runners on, but didn't score.  Well no surprise there, but
when I returned and looked up the final score, it didn't take long to
figure out that our bullpen had something to do with it.

I also love the way our hitters came out swinging, until the score got
to be too much for them.

Lowry is definitely the most valuable Giant this year.  Best ERA in the
rotation, moonlight pinch hitter/pinch runner/right fielder.  He can replace
Sweeney/Ellison/Lewis all by himself. ;-)

Why should they trade Roberts?  Just dump him the hell in McCovey Cove
and makes sure Durham goes in after him.  What a total waste as an
outfielder.  His speed on the bases, without much in the way of
brains, doesn't translate well in the outfield.  Durham has little or
not discipline at the plate and for that matter, neither does most of
the freaking lineup.

I mean, could the Giants have made it any easier for Gorzelanny? Going
into the hole two strikes without making him work?  Pop ups? Anyone
get past 2nd base?  FIRE THE DAMN BATTING INSTRUCTION AND THE PITCHING
COACH.  I don't know if this was their worst game of the year, but
it's damn close.  The meek shall inherit the shutout and the meek are
the Giants.

I'm struck with nostalgia almost every time I listen to a Giants'
game.  Who wouldn't be?   I remember the Giants of the 60's when high
scoring games were the norm.  Anyone remember scores like 15-14 or
14-13 when the Giants played in Chicago?  I'm not making up those
scores, that was what happened and the Giants didn't turn into
shrinking violets at the sight of the other team scoring a lot of
runs. They just went out and scored more runs.

Pitching?  They didn't have any damn relief pitchers and if a starter
got hammered, too damn bad. Well in most cases, you could get a long
stint on the mound from your starter.  Not a bunch of armless clowns
who think five innings is some kind of accomplishment.

When a game went into late innings and the Giants were behind, you
knew they had a decent change of pulling the game out and walking off
with the win.  Today's bunch of ass clowns just walk up to the plate
and back to the dugout, probably satsified that they did their bit in
scoring four runs while the other team scored five.

Hitting?  What hitting?  A hit here, a hit there and that's about it.
Right now they've got Kevin Frandsen wrestling the hit-into-double
plays title away from Ray Durham. Yes, I'm spoiled. Spoiled by some
mighty good Giants' teams of the past.  Teams that could field and
were a pleasure to watch.

Our current Giants are insufferable now and will be easily forgettable
soon, like other Giants of the past, although certainly not the ones you
mentioned. Already the Clark/Thompson era might seem to be divided from
the Bonds/Kent era by a score of home runs by Matt Williams and a pair
of bad starts by William Van Landingham. At some point in the future the
Bonds/Kent era will seem to be separated by whatever's coming that's
worth remembering only by 715, 756, and -- I'm estimating here -- a pair
of bad starts by Barry Zito. Of course it may take some time to get
there.

I did pull &quot;Annie Hall&quot; down from that shelf, where it had been for
years, and it may in fact be the movie about nostalgia that I remembered
it to be, nostalgically. So I can answer Fleur's reference with this:

I am, Rad Doc, sort of a 21st century version of Alvie Singer. Not a
red-haired Jewish twerp, necessarily, but I do live in the past. Modern
life passed me by 20 years ago -- at least! I always say that I wish I
had been born 30, 40 or 50 years before I actually was, just so I would
have been around to enjoy the things I now enjoy in vicarious
retrospect. Nostalgia may not be all it's cracked up to be but when I
see a lot of the &quot;modern&quot; stuff going on today, I'll take it.

It's a fashion culture; our economy is partly driven by the rate of
obsolescence. If you have a strong enough notion of being someone from
someplace that you're not regularly supplanting most of what you value,
then you are not vital to the engine. Perhaps you are also un-American
enough not to have two mortgages on your home. We will be watching you.

Seriously, Alvy (as I finally realized the name is spelled) could not
enjoy what he had when he had it, and then when he lost it he began to
romanticize it. Not the same at all as keeping hold of things one values.

Some things you hold onto, and some things hold onto you. Other things
fall away naturally in the course of time. The entire advertising
industry is dedicated to the task of inverting all that. I try to help
my kids to make a sport of spotting the lies.

I embrace trying something or somebody new. What's the good in keeping
vets of they don't perform up to standards?  The Giants should embrace
the youth movement up and down the lineup, throughout the starting
rotation and end with the bullpen.  Come to think of it, management
wouldn't be bad place look as well.

I agree. How will you ever know what Ortmeier, Frandsen and Davis can
really do if they don't play every day? Sit down Durham, Winn and Roberts,
and let these guys play out the season.

Ortmeier is 26, with 2,217 minor-league ABs and a 781 OPS.
Frandsen is 25, with 979 minor-league ABs and an 852 OPS.
Davis is 26, with 2,420 minor-league ABs and a 782 OPS.

That is a lot of playing every day without a lot of hitting.

No, prospects look like this:

Yeah, but how do you bring them up? 40 man roster? They won't get many
chances before the season is over. I'm convinced that management is
committed to Davis, Ortmeier and Frandsen for the near future.

Now, looking at the situation, I'm also convinced that they hired the
wrong manager. They must have really believed that this club could
somehow contend (love is blind) while most of us in here gave it no
chance. Bochy is a play-it-safe guy who likes veteran players, and likes
his comfort zone. He's not likely to trust young guys too far.

Looking back at the season, if Rajai Davis can play at a decent level,
getting him for Morris and salary was a huge plus. Time will only tell if
he is for real, or is just suffering from Randy Winn Syndrome. Winn has
actually been decent this year. I could live with a slap hitting CF with
blinding speed like Davis for a few years if he could hit .275. His speed
complicates things for opposing pitchers, and he can certainly cover any
center field known to man. Unlike Fred Lewis, he also can actually catch
the ball. He creates opportunities on the basepaths.

Durham must be dislodged from 2nd base, and Frandsen is the heir
apparent. Not to mention the stick-jam (as opposed to log-jam) at first
which also must be dealt with. We could live with Vizquel at short if he
could hit at replacement level, just for his defense.

Hate to mention this, but Feliz has become a capable defensive third
baseman, and looks better at the plate these days. All a green light for
Sabean to resign him. Feliz is one of the smaller problems we have right
now (which in itself says a lot.)

Bring Bonds back? With one caveat - you WILL play first base. Like it or
lump it.

Molina has been a pleasant surprise, despite some defensive lapses. The
best catcher we have had since Santiago.

Bochy had no hand in signing any of these guys, nor can he be blamed
for the cumulative 0.700 OPS of this shitty offense.  He has little
choice to play anything other than veterans.  Granted, I doubt he's
the greatest manager in the MLB, but blaming him for playing the only
hand he's dealt is ridiculous.

He's been among the best at third with the glove, if not the best, for a

The best.

His play at the 3 bag is great.  I haven't seen a stronger arm at his
position (in the Giants org) in my lifetime.  He's fun to bag on, but
he plays great D and he comes off as a generally nice guy.  He also
has a better OPS than more that half of the regular starting lineup.

&gt;&gt;I agree. How will you ever know what

Unfortunately, the Giants do not have Braun, Butler and Upton playing
for them (nor in their system). Thus, at *this* moment, we are stuck
with the likes of Ortmeier, Frandsen, Davis, et. al., as our version of
&quot;prospects&quot; (alleged or otherwise). Whether or not any of these guys is
good enough to steal PT away from any of the veterans is another
question. Davis (until he stops hitting, which could happen any day now)
and Ortmeier are at least earning some platoon ABs right now. Frandsen,
on the other hand, has failed again and again this season when given the
chance to earn PT. He says he can hit at the major league level but talk
is cheap. You've got to be able to walk it, not just talk it, which is
why he has been unable to take a job away from a guy having the worst
season of his career.

The other day, I was -- not just surprised, but shocked! -- to learn
that Happy has been the 9th toughest player to strike out in the NL this
season. Our Petey! The guy whom we all know and love as the guy
helplessly flailing at two-strike breaking pitches low and away, nowhere
near the zone. Which is probably the only good thing (his strikeout rate
this season) one can say about his hitting. His RBI total, by
comparison, is way down from last season. And that's not just because he
hasn't had many chances with runners on.

But his fielding! In my estimation, he and Vizquel this season have made
up a left-side-of-the-infield defensive combo at least as good as any
other in MLB.

That's what I said a few days ago, so even though I'd hate to see him go,

Lowry has been just as lucky as Cain has been unlucky. If you divided the
luck equally between them, they'd both be about .500 pitchers on a sub .500

That may be so, but I'll bet he'll be back next year.  There's no one in
