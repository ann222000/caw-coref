[...I think the writer has a pretty good handle on what we can expect.
The question is asked at the end...what would you do? I would press
the subpoenas to the hilt and let Bush continue to show the world just
how corrupt and venal this administration is.]

Has the Scooter Libby pre-pardon tipped Bush's hand with respect to
the subpoena drama we can expect to play out later this month?

Well, perhaps not fully.

But given how brazen an act it was, it demonstrates that Bush would
almost certainly be willing to contemplate more such acts. Why he
feels emboldened to do so is something we might spend a fair amount of
time debating, but let's get right to the larger question: Will George
W. Bush also pardon and/or commute the sentences of anyone held in
contempt of Congress for defying the recently issued and still-to-be
issued subpoenas from the committees investigating his
&quot;administration's&quot; varied and widespread wrongdoing?

The subpoenas we all have our eyes on at the moment are those issued
by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Remember those subpoenas were
themselves issued because the &quot;administration&quot; has become so
thoroughly corrupted that the Department of Justice has been directed
to prosecute or decline to prosecute federal criminal cases based on
partisan political considerations. And yet, the power on which the
Congress currently relies to enforce their subpoenas is the threat of
having that same Department of Justice bringing charges of statutory
contempt of Congress against anyone who defies them.

Senator Leahy posits that it would be very difficult, politically, for
the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- at whose discretion
the decision to prosecute will be made -- not to proceed if directed
to do so by Congress. Under ordinary circumstances, this is true.

But yesterday, George W. Bush has shown us that he will go to
extraordinary lengths to protect members of his &quot;administration&quot; who
find themselves in trouble with the law for carrying out his
instructions and policies. So we must now ask whether he might not
very well do the same for anyone who finds themselves facing contempt
of Congress charges for asserting his position, insisting that they
will not comply (for whatever reason) with Congressional subpoenas?

Yesterday's action also changes the post-subpoena calculus. Whereas
previously it was thought that the Vice President might direct the
Department of Justice to simply decline to prosecute any contempt
charges referred to the U.S. Attorney (or even file suit separately to
enjoin such an action), now it must be asked whether it isn't a
strategically wiser choice to let the prosecutions go forward, in slow
motion.

Why not let the prosecutions proceed, if at a snail's pace? It eats up
considerably more of the time remaining on the clock, and leaves
Congress holding the bag, able only to complain about the pace. And at
the end of the road, if there's a conviction, simply pull out the
Scooter Libby playbook. Appeal every facet of the case, and when your
luck finally runs out and someone has to pay the piper, the Vice
President can simply commute the sentence or pardon them. Voil√†! It's
almost time to escape out the back door, and everyone goes home scot
free. Congress never gets the documents or testimony they've demanded,
it's subpoena power is forever after in question, the Vice President's
political opposition is rendered impotent, and his political loyalists
are once again reminded of the special favor and power their loyalty
buys.

What would you do?
