I am rather surprised that there was no caution and that Harvick and Martin
were allowed to race to the line.

I don't think this is the first time - it seems that if the wreck happens
behind the leaders in turn 4, they let the leaders race.  The wreck was in
motion and a caution was not going to stop anything.

I'm not. The wreck was behind them and happened at the beginning of the
tri-oval so by the time anyone was able to slow the accident would have been
all over with anyway. If they had thrown it then KH would have a very good
reason to make claims to the winners circle.

Well, according to NASCAR's "rules" there should have been one, and
the field frozen.  But as we well know, NASCAR revises their rules
as and when they please.

That said, it's no secret that I am strongly in favor of racing to
the line, so I think NASCAR made the right call.

Maybe a question? How When do "they"  (who?) decide when to throw the
yellow?

Because they see to the wreck site? Can they? Must vary with the wreck
site.
\
Are there "authorized caution callers" around the track? Like
spotters?

Is it thrown faster if "they" see fire vs smoke?

In fact, who decides whether caution is in order?

I think Mike Joy did a great job defending the decision
on Wind Tunnel tonight--along with some great footage
that shows that it's not clear who would have won
if the yellow flag had been thrown between the time
that KyBu fishtailed and the time that KH &amp; MM
crossed the line.  Most of that time, KH was in
front of MM.

Joy's analysis:

1. No wrecks would have been stopped by throwing the
flag.

2. By not throwing the flag, NASCAR let MM &amp; KH settle
the Big Question by racing.

3. No one in the wreck was endangered by the race between
MM &amp; KH.

Not covered: was not throwing the flag unfair to the rest
of the field.  Lots of folks got passed (eg Blaney in the
07) who would not have been passed under the normal
"instant yellow" rules.

On balance, I think NASCAR made the right call.

Mike Joy said that he looked over at the three men who have
the power to make the call.  One was Mike Helton.  I didn't
recognize the other two names--but their whole job is to
run the race.  Bill France was not among the three.

I'm sure they have discussed your other questions.

They don't have much time to decide.

Sometimes they let folks spin out, restart, and move on.
Sometimes they don't.

I wouldn't be surprised to find out that they thought
things through before the race.

"What happens if there is a wreck on the white flag
lap in turn one?  Turn two?  Turn three?  Turn four?
What if the wreck happens behind the leaders?  (Seems
like that is the most common scenario.)

When push comes to shove, it's a human judgment: "This
situation needs a flag.  That one doesn't."

All good comments Marty, especially those I left above.

All such organizations, have to put the authority to make
such decisions quickly and under pressure, on people they
trust.  These are people who generally make good ones.
They have to do the best they can at THAT moment.
And indeed, there may be times when in hindsight they
may have private thoughts about how to do better next time.

They might say that, but I don't think they mean it.

Their meaning is that "the race will end if there is a
caution flag on the last two laps."

They also said (at one point) that there were three
laps left.  They really meant two, and kind of corrected
the error within a minute or so.

There are three final flags but only two laps:

Green: one lap.

White: one lap.

Checkered: race over.

It seems to me on my mental replay tape that I can hear
the talent (Mike Joy?  Well, it's his voice in my head.)
saying: "If a caution comes out during the overtime, the
race will end under caution."

Yes this is the procedure that they will follow. Because this crash happened
in the tri-oval I can tell you that nothing would have changed except
'maybe' the scoring and even then, MM may not have been the leader at the
moment the yellow was shown. It does take a few seconds for that to happen.
Also, what if KH had been ruled ahead at the time the yellow actually came
out, i.e. the lights changed to yellow, and MM would have been the leader
when they crossed the line? The hue and cry from the fans would have been,
and rightfully so, thunderous. From someone who has been in this position a
number of times as the flagman and race director responsible for calling the
yellow flag, I would have and have done the same thing that NASCAR did, let
the leaders finish under green. Nobody, and I mean nobody would have been
spared in that crash because they simply would not have been able to react
getting the yellow light out and then the drivers and spotters communicating
with the drivers, able to slow down or even react to avoid crashing. It was
a great call on NASCAR's behalf.

Something has been over-looked in all the emotional discussion about the effect of
a Yellow on the relative positions of Kevin and Mark.

*IF* the caution had been thrown and the field frozen at some earlier point in
time, the 'official' finishing position of many of those involved in the wreckage,

I heartily (and respectfully) disagree!

I think NASCAR is trying to have their cake and eat it, too.  It was their

boasted about their ability to accurately determine running positions as of the
moment of freezing the field.

They should have done so yesterday.

The rule is,
there will be ONE attempt to achieve a checkered flag finish.
If there is a caution thrown in that attempt, the race will

BUT, they have not throw the yellow when they have had these accidents on
the last 1/4 lap on the final lap, so here, at least they are being
consistant.

Now, I do think Nascar should address this offically but I think if they
thew the yellow, it would have been more problematic because of how they
have done it the past couple of years, even with the new rule.

Tom, my point was that it would have been physically impossible to bring out
the yellow light to change very much of the finishing order with the
exception of those that were able to get through the crash and even then, I
am not sure that they did not throw the yellow and freeze the feiled after
the first three cars passed the finsih line.

I've seen mixed reports today.

It may take a while for the official story to get
settled.

There is no doubt that the extra time allowed for KH and MM to
settle the race at the line before throwing the yellow allowed
a lot of wrecked cars to get passed.  That's what Clint Bowyer
was saying in his post-race interview, I think.  He knew he
wasn't in 18th place when the wreck started and wanted to know
how he could drop so low if the caution was out (at least I
think that was what he was sayin').

I agree, but

1)  something's wrong when the "right call" is contrary to your
announced rule and normal practice.

2)  if "race back to the yellow" was still the rule, then there
wouldn't be any need for calls, right, wrong, or inbetweenly.

After watching and looking at replays about 7 times it would be inconclusive
whether MM would of had the race. This is solely dependent upon on when and
if a caution flag would of been waved.

MM had the lead from the exit of turn 4 to the restart line. KyBu started
spinning when the leaders were coming out of turn 4. It took approx. 5
seconds from that point to the restart line. It took 3 seconds from the
restart line to the finish line in which that was the time KH retook the
lead.

In short, I think that the officials would of been a little trigger happy if
they had thrown the yellow within that 5 seconds. The wreck wasn't obvious
enought until the leaders were already approaching the finish line.

I'm glad didn't interfeer with the results. It would of been more explaining
on their part than it is already is now.

had the lead once KH had passed him in turn four. Right a the restart line
is where MM might of had the besKH and MM were

&gt;&gt;am not sure that they did not throw the yellow and freeze the field after

&gt; I've seen mixed reports today.

&gt; It may take a while for the official story to get
&gt; settled.

&gt; There is no doubt that the extra time allowed for KH and MM to
&gt; settle the race at the line before throwing the yellow allowed
&gt; a lot of wrecked cars to get passed.  That's what Clint Bowyer
&gt; was saying in his post-race interview, I think.  He knew he
&gt; wasn't in 18th place when the wreck started and wanted to know
&gt; how he could drop so low if the caution was out (at least I
&gt; think that was what he was sayin').

I don't recall NASCAR ever announcing a rule that stated they would drop a
yellow flag for everything.  I thought I recalled them always defending and
upholding their right to make the determination.

That sounds about right to me.

But this is clearly going to be one of those Great Divides
in NASCAR fandom.  Folks have got their interpretation of
what DID happen and what SHOULD have happened, and probably
can't be argued out of their view.  It's a blik (perception
of a whole, a Gestalt, an intuitive perception, a combination
of data, insight, understanding, taste, and judgment).

I respect people who have a different blik from mine.

I imagine (without any proof whatsoever--sorry!) that the
guys who have the power to make the call discuss "what-if"
scenarios all season long and all during the off-season
so that when accidents do happen, they have a common view
of what the "right call" is in that situation.

What we need--and don't have and probably can't get--is
a replay of the last eight seconds of the race in tenths
of seconds and with the scoring loops marked on the track.
Then the game begins with estimating the earliest possible
point at which the officials COULD have thrown the flag
and a determination of who was where on the timing loops
at that point.  NASCAR can probably diagram that with
the information they have at their disposal.  I doubt
they'll make it available to us any time soon.  :o)

As the seconds (or tenths of seconds) tick by on this
imaginary replay, we know that Harvick is in front for
some of it and Martin in front for other parts of it.

If MM hadn't wobbled, he might have edged KH at the
line (or so it says in my imaginary replay--YMMV).

KH and his fans could then complain that the yellow
should have flown while KH was ahead on the scoring
loops because that was the "right" time to throw
the caution flag.

For me, it's all part of the fun.  I was entertained
and I'll come back for more.

FWIW, I like Terry Blount's assessment:

The "announced rule" is to not race back to the flag, but to end
the race when the yellow comes out.  The "normal practice" is to
throw the yellow for any damfool incident (rollbar padding on the
track, etc).  Certainly when Busch hit Kenseth, resulting in Busch
sliding crosswise to the track in the lower lane and Kenseth up
into the outside wall, a caution would normally be thrown.
