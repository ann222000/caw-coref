&quot;As a result, the French Government last week introduced a new anti-piracy
measure that some say could herald the end of file-sharing as we know it.
Under the plan, ISPs would hand over the details of the biggest users of
file-sharing networks to an enforcement body. The new P2P police force would
then issue cease and desist warnings to the offending downloaders. If
unheeded, they'd be disconnected.

What makes this plan a landmark in the battle against piracy is that the
telecoms industry has signed on. Historically, ISPs everywhere strongly
objected to any form of enforcement that required them to turn over their
customers to the attorneys of various copyright holders. Under the French
plan, they must.&quot;

Alas, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum have supported
the music labels and movie studios in extending the reach of their copyright
protection, in the U.S. some of the most determined hired guns on behalf of
the entertainment industry have been Democrats.  Some folks argued years ago
that P2P would always be immune while I suggested it would take only the
right piece of legislation to bring it crashing down.  Well, if this catches
on, here it comes.

Although the Dead and a relative handful of other artists allow taping and
trading, I'd bet that the majority of P2P is in fact violating copyright.
Even if the material being exchanged is a fan's live recording rather than a
commercial release it's still protected by copyright, so a torrent network
that prohibits commercial releases is still facilitating copyright violation
if its members are torrenting 30-year-old live bootlegs without permission
from the artist and/or their label.

On the other hand Pearl Jam demonstrated what to do about bootlegging when
they released the shows from their 2000 tour direct to fans, they sold two
and a half million copies.  The Who sell CDs and DVDs of their shows (since
2002) with the profits going to charity.  A lot of other bands offer live
souvenir recordings either right after the show or by mail, and that cuts
off bootleggers at the knees.  Some bands even make an effort to unearth
ancient recordings, clean them up and sell them to their fans so even
unauthorized traffic in their old material is diminished.  So there is
plenty of evidence that fans will buy music if it is offered to them,
they'll turn to bootlegs only when that's their only recourse.

Many artists benefited greatly from bootlegs and trading in their early
years, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica are two that come to mind; their
views changed later once they were commercially successful.  All things
considered the whole issue of bootlegging (commercial or amateur) is not as
simple as the music labels would have you believe.  The labels helped create
the underground market by failing to provide fans with the music they
wanted--some famous official live releases came about because the labels
were embarrassed by bootleggers doing a better job of meeting the public's
demand for live releases, e.g. Live at Leeds or Get Your Ya Yas Out or the
Basement Tapes.

If such a law as described in this article was aimed strictly at those
copying commercial albums and movies then it wouldn't bother me, I think
people who copy commercially available music are stealing, and claiming the
new Ray Davies album is an import so it doesn't count is a feeble excuse.
But the entertainment industry won't differentiate between someone ripping
off the latest Hollywood blockbuster and someone happy to have found an
obscure audience recording from back in the 70s, they'll shut it all down if
they can, in a way we'll have the thieves who copy commercial releases to
thank for that.

That wouldn't surprise me in the slightest, but it's still not the

will be fairly compensated for their work.  P2P is used &quot;legimitately&quot;
to trade music the artists allow to be traded and even to distribute
Linux distributions and other software.  The proposed French ban
doesn't distinguish, from what I can tell.

This is very true, the success of some of the Dead's releases (such as

well.  Since the music has already been recorded and generally only
needs a little bit of cleanup (and can even be distributed on-line
with no actual physical goods sales) it seems like lots of bands could
be making some money here.  Of course, arguments over who gets
compensated for bands with a long history of changing band members
and/or having them die will slow some distribution down, but overall
there's money to be made here.

Yeah, that's somewhat my take as well.  I've never used P2P to obtain

What is scary is the only way they'll be able to distinguish is by
eavesdropping on what you're sending and receiving, in effect opening your

computers in search of copyright violating files with immunity for any
damage they cause if they just *suspect* you're sharing copyrighted files,

Yup, it's the folks trading current commercial releases who are getting the

Um, actually there is.  Copyright applies to the songwriting (which is
generally not owned by the labels, although sometimes...) and the
actual physical recording (which is what the labels own).  Which is
why bands can sell live recordings of their concerts outside their
normal record labels - the record labels only own the music recorded
specifically for the album, not all live performances.  So, in theory,
the artists could come after you if they wanted to but there's no
clear understanding of whether they would be able to collect any
damages.

Technically, by recording a concert yourself you can assert copyright
on that recording but if you try and sell it good luck with that.
Trading, where no money changes hands, falls far too low beneath the
radar for most bands to care, those that are aware of it tend to
either ignore it or encourage it.

Plenty of high profile artists can be found on the popular trackers.
The smart trackers have strict &quot;no commercially released material&quot;
policies and remove a given artist from the tracker if they get any
grief from the band's lawyers.

Not exactly, artists are often under exclusive contract to their labels,
which is why you sometimes see &quot;Courtesy of [insert name of label]&quot; when an
artist does a guest shot on somebody else's recording, the artist needs the
label's permission to record elsewhere.  That's also why a lot of old blues
or jazz artists recorded under phony names at times, to get paid for work
outside their exclusive contracts.  That probably applies less than it used
to as artists get smarter about what they sign and the old label model
breaks down, but you can't universally assume that an artist can do live
releases independent of his main label.

I also didn't mean to suggest that the label controls all aspects of
copyright, however note that the RIAA will go after a bootlegger regardless
of whether the source of the product is studio outtakes recorded by a label,

&gt;&gt; Um, actually there is.  Copyright applies to the songwriting (which is
&gt;&gt; generally not owned by the labels, although sometimes...) and the
&gt;&gt; actual physical recording (which is what the labels own).  Which is
&gt;&gt; why bands can sell live recordings of their concerts outside their
&gt;&gt; normal record labels - the record labels only own the music recorded
&gt;&gt; specifically for the album, not all live performances.

&gt;Not exactly, artists are often under exclusive contract to their labels,
&gt;which is why you sometimes see &quot;Courtesy of [insert name of label]&quot; when an
&gt;artist does a guest shot on somebody else's recording, the artist needs the
&gt;label's permission to record elsewhere.  That's also why a lot of old blues
&gt;or jazz artists recorded under phony names at times, to get paid for work
&gt;outside their exclusive contracts.  That probably applies less than it used
&gt;to as artists get smarter about what they sign and the old label model
&gt;breaks down, but you can't universally assume that an artist can do live
&gt;releases independent of his main label.
">

You're confusing a recording done commercial release and a concert
performance - generally speaking the labels have no inherent rights to
a concert performance unless they recorded it for release.  Generally
speaking, of course, and not always true (depending on the terms of
the contract).  That's why you get &quot;so and so appears courtesey of
this record label&quot; or blues/jazz artists recording under different
names - the label has their commercial recording rights, not their
performance rights.

And yet there hasn't been a Dylan show in *years* that wasn't recorded

Brad, it's pretty common practice in record contracts today to give the
record companies the rights to a percentage of concert royalties and the
recording of said events.  So an artist under contract is generally not
allowed to sell their own music in any form without approval from the
record company.  That means that they aren't allowed to have live shows
available for download without the record company's approval.  When you
sign a big label deal, the record company doesn't merely own the
recorded CD.  They own your career.  The only thing they don't own is
your publishing, unless of course you sell a portion of that off.

But you're referring to recordings of a concert that are intended for

multi-track tape, etc.  And yeah, I would agree that if the label
sprung for that equipment and manpower they'd have a say in the
commercial release of the concert.

But most concerts are not recorded for possible future release.  The
band may run a two-track tape at the board in order to hear how they

None of this has anything to do with John Fogerty and his relationship
with Fantasy Records, of course.  He got screwed with the contract he
signed, he wound up getting sued for plagerizing himself at one point
(a case he won), and now that's in the past.  He didn't play Creedence
material live for 15 years or whatever because of bitterness, not
because of legal reasons (none of the legal issues had been resolved
when he started playing Creedence material in '87).  Had he decided to
release any concert performances of Creedence material he would have
had to pay songwriting royalties, though.

It might not be quite as common today but in the past the labels certainly
tied down their artists in this fashion and I'd bet it's still not uncommon.
To quote from Krasilovky and Shemel, The Business of Music, 1995, pp. 11-12:
&quot;Most artist recording contracts require the artist to record exclusively
for the record company. . . . Exceptions exist, especially in the fields of
classical and jazz.  In these fields it is common to find the same artist
featured on albums issued by various companies. . . . In addition to
prohibiting recordings for others during the term of the agreement, the
recording contract will usually forbid recording the same selection for
another company for a minimum period.  This is known as the &quot;re-recording
restriction.&quot;  In most contracts the restrictive period is five years from
the date of delivery of the recordings to the record company or two years
from the expiration of the term of the recording contract, whichever is
later. . . . Since an artist's performance is unique, the courts will
ordinarily enjoin the artist from recording for another company in violation
of the exclusivity clause.&quot;

It's notable that many of the bands releasing Instant Live and similar
souvenir live recordings are not exactly A-List performers, perhaps the
labels aren't so concerned if artists who don't sell a ton of CDs anymore
make side deals for such releases, but it would be a surprise to see the
major acts allowed to do so.

Most of the venues that do Instant Live tend to be smaller indoor
venues or sheds for summer shows which generally don't attract the
A-List performers.  I think this in part is a technology/logistics
issue.  I don't know what percentage of people buy Instant Live CDs at
the show but assuming the percentages stay the same you've got to
produce a lot more CDs for a stadium show than a shed show (and then
find a way to efficiently distribute them to the peope who bought
them, the distribution at shed shows seems pretty slow to me as it
is).

And again, this has nothing to do with trading bootleg recordings
where nobody is &quot;releasing&quot; a recording and selling it (selling
bootlegs is another issue, of course).  As far as I can tell there's
no case law to define whether trading bootleg recordings is legal or
not, the fact that no money changes hands and that it only happens in
small numbers for any particular artist probably has a lot to do with
why the labels don't try and make a test case.  Until they stop all
the pirating that goes on and stop anyone selling bootlegs I don't see
them caring about small-time tape trading (in other words, I don't see
them caring ever).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fantasy records, though.  They did claim he owed them 46 songs at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time Creedence broke up, he was bitter towards his former bandmates
&gt;&gt;&gt; and didn't play any Creedence material live for many years as a result
&gt;&gt;&gt; of this.
&gt;&gt; Brad, it's pretty common practice in record contracts today to give the
&gt;&gt; record companies the rights to a percentage of concert royalties and the
&gt;&gt; recording of said events.  So an artist under contract is generally not
&gt;&gt; allowed to sell their own music in any form without approval from the
&gt;&gt; record company.  That means that they aren't allowed to have live shows
&gt;&gt; available for download without the record company's approval.  When you
&gt;&gt; sign a big label deal, the record company doesn't merely own the
&gt;&gt; recorded CD.  They own your career.  The only thing they don't own is
&gt;&gt; your publishing, unless of course you sell a portion of that off.

&gt; But you're referring to recordings of a concert that are intended for
&gt; release - i.e., using a full mixing board to record, recording to
&gt; multi-track tape, etc.  And yeah, I would agree that if the label
&gt; sprung for that equipment and manpower they'd have a say in the
&gt; commercial release of the concert.

No, actually, I'm not talking merely recordings intended for commercial
release.  I'm referring to the standard deals given to new artists.
Now, it rarely comes up that an artist would sell a soundboard of their
concert recording.  But while under contract, in most cases, the label
takes this scenario into account when drawing up contracts.  The big
labels control you the artist.  The only thing they don't own outright
is your publishing. They often take a percentage of your merchandise and
have complete say over what you can release and when you can release it,
no matter that the recording was financed by the label itself.  That's
my understanding based on personal experience.  I'm obviously not a
entertainment business lawyer.

You're completely right about Fogerty BTW.  No disagreement from me there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're confusing a recording done commercial release and a concert

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speaking, of course, and not always true (depending on the terms of

My experience is the labels don't really care about traders of
bootlegs, that's all I'm trying to say.  They may care on some low,
low level but they've got bigger fish to fry.  The legality of trading
bootlegs has never been brought to court so it's not clear how the
courts would rule on the practice.

I'm sure plenty of bands sign restrictive contracts and get screwed
over, there are too many examples to doubt that.

Yeah, it's a shame he got so screwed up about the whole thing.
Although he seems to have completely put it in his past now.

Ahem, in some cases pissed-off bands have arranged for tapes to find their
way into the hands of bootleggers purely as a thumb-in-the-eye to their
labels.  Disgruntled employees of the band are also a source of tapes, I
heard from one engineer who discovered late in a tour that the band was
ripping him off.  So at the final gig at the Royal Albert Hall he auctioned
off his quality control DAT to the hardcore fans gathered around the mixing
desk, got fifteen hundred bucks.  He figured he was never going to work for
those assholes again so why not get back some of the money they were
screwing him out of and irritate them with a bootleg they wouldn't make any
money on at the same time.  Apparently his reputation was good enough that
he didn't have to worry much about other bands not hiring him because of
this incident, he was just getting back what was owed him.

In really nasty contracts they even own music you might create later if your
band breaks up and you continue to work solo, I know a guy who found out
about that one the hard way.  The only way out of the contract (which the
company had the right to renew) was to get the company to decline to renew,
so he and his bandmates intentionally made their band such a disaster that
the company decided to dump them.  The labels and management companies have
been at this a long time, they know what they're doing, you need a sharp
entertainment industry lawyer to keep you from signing the wrong piece of
paper which you'll regret forever.
