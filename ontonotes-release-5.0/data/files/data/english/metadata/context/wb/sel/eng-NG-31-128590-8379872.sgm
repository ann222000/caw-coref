happy to be a member, and hope you enjoy!

That web page says:
&quot;At the time of the Norman conquest Cumberland was so impoverished,
that William the Conqueror remitted all its taxations; for which
reason it is not rated in the Domesday book as other counties are.&quot;.

Which is quite wrong.

Here's a quote from &quot;The Lake District&quot; by Roy Millward &amp; Adrian
Robinson which I hope will explain the situation regarding Cumberland
around the time of the Conquest better than I can.

&quot;The important dates of regional history often bear little
relationship to the major events in the chronology of the nation.
Never is this idea more clearly illustrated than when we consider the
Norman Conquest in the north of England. 1066 represents one of the
great watersheds of our national history, but at that time it was
debatable whether the Lake District would belong to Scotland or
England. At the time of the Norman Conquest the armies of the Scots,
under Malcolm III, overran the whole of the country from the Solway
Firth to the Eamont and occupied the Vale of Eden and the western
entrance to the pass of Stainmore. For a quarter of a century the
frontier of Scotland lay across the dome of the Lake District. As a
result, almost the whole of Cumberland and much of Westmorland lay
outside the province of the Domesday Survey of 1086. Estates in the
southern part of the Lake District - in Kentdale, Furness and the
southwestern tip of Cumberland around Millom - appear under Yorkshire
in the great survey.&quot;
