Hey Guys,

Me and my gf will be vacationing in Florida (for the second time)
during February. We are planning a cruise to the east Caribbean,
leaving from Miami.
Before the cruise we will have about 4 days to spend. Since we've
already been to Miami (South beach, didn't like it btw) and Orlando
we're looking to do something else. Therefore, we've been considering
spending those 4 days in the Key West (and then drive back to Miami
for the cruise) or alternatively, in Ft. Lauderdale which we've never
been to as well. Now I don't know if these locations are in any way
comparable, but I just wanted to get some advice on making the
decision here. I'd like to point out that we're not into diving /
snorkling etc, but we do love sightseeing, dining at quality
restaurants and shopping.

Any thoughts? :)

Thanks in advance,

Danny

It depends on what you like.  Fort Lauderdale is similar to Miami --
south florida urban by the sea.  I like Fort Lauderdale myself as there
are some inexpensive gay B&amp;B.  Like Miami, Ft. Lauderdale has museums,
cultural  events  like the Ft. Lauderdale Symphony.  Also there are Film
Fests, restaurants for every taste and shopping.  Las Olas is the
entertainment and shopping sector.  You can check out Ft. Lauderdale's
web pages for calendar of events and details: http://sunny.org

Key West has its historic homes, the Hemingway House, Truman Capote's
home, and the Audubon House to name a few.  The food is fantastic!   If
you like fresh seafood, this is the place.  If you don't like to deal
with waves then Smathers Beach is the place for you.  The beach is made
up of pulverized coral, so it's a good idea to rent a beach lounge.
Many of the  B&amp;B are clothing optional and most have a pool and/or jacuzzi.

Aside from dining, touring historic homes, shopping for unique things,
it's very popular to be on the water or in it.  Scuba and snorkel boat
trips are one way to see the coral reefs that run from Key West to Key
Largo.  Deep sea fishing is popular as are sunset sails on tall ships.
Key West has a healthy nightlife scene.  There are bars that serve food
and music.  There are bars that serve music and drink.  There are bars
that serve drink and drag queen shows.  Jazz, Rock, Mellow Acoustic  you
name it you can probably find a place that serves it up.

Look up the keys and Key West here: http://floridakeys.com/ or
http://www.fla-keys.com/ or http://keywestparadise.com/

You'll find these to be rather extensive guides to what you can see and
do in Key West and the Florida Keys.

As Brian said, Ft. Lauderdale is a another urban coastal city, although the
final choice really depends on your preferences. My preference would be Key
West, any day. (I'm not crazy about South Beach, either, although the gay
scene is heavy in both places, if that's what bothers you). You don't need a
car, you can stroll around town or rent bicycles. The place has more of a
holiday feel to it, sort of the last-outpost feeling. Many art galleries,
plenty of historic sightseeing, good shopping, and fantastic restaurants.
Don't let Duval Street get you down, make sure you get off that main drag of
t-shirt shops and you'll find lots of treasures. There are many lovely,
historic B&amp;Bs. Sundown each evening if a big event.

If you're looking for something &quot;other worldly,&quot; do Key West, but
drive there.  Getting there via the Overseas Highway (US 1) is half
the fun.  Stop at John Pennekamp and Bahia Honda State Parks...
www.pennekamppark.com .  Many of the tour boats that do snorkling
trips during the day, offer sunset harbour cruises at dusk, but as others
have said, there's plenty to do otherwise.  Visit... www.keywest.com

With 4 days and a car you have time to:

Day 1. Drive from Miami/Lauderdale to Key West. Take a hotel or motel.
Spend rest of the day there and some of the next.
Day 2.  Return to Miami.
Day 3.  Drive north on I-95 to West Palm Beach,
only 60 miles.
- Expensive/extensive shopping/dining there.
- Come back down the scenic ocean rte - A-1, A-1A.
- Fine shopping/dining in Del Ray, some in Boynton
- Good shopping/dining in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

[The drive to Key West is not too long on a weekday
but can be very long on a weekend. So you might
want to reverse above order on doing things, depending on
your situation.]

The Beach even if you don't plan to sun and swim.  There aren't any
decent hotels downtown.  It's mostly offices, government buildings and
some museums. West is mostly residential, and the Everglades. There
really isn't much North along the Beach.  Inland North you get
Plantation, lots of golf courses, and big hotels with big prices.
Hollywood is family oriented.  Mostly everything there is a little
shopworn, but you might get your price there.  Use Priceline.com or
Hotels.com to see if you can get a bargain that isn't a dump.
