Maybe the last remaining possibility for Psychobarbie, to earn some
money. She didn't learn anything but Scientology and with dusting of
Ron's picture on his desk in Ron's office (for example in Munich), she
can't make any money :-)

Sure, I am the only person on the Internet, didn't you knew that,
spammer Stephen Badman? Nobody else can post on the Internet, only I.

And your &quot;affirmations&quot; are forgeries.

Quote of a Wikipedia top administrator, lawyer, and friend of Jimbo
Wales
on the Wikipedia &quot;article&quot; on me:
# Delete - An embarrassment to Wikipedia. It has proved impossible to
maintain the article appropriately. Whatever her supposed
notability, Barbara Schwarz is not a public figure. Her privacy
should
be respected. Fred Bauder 15:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC) -- End of
quote.

(He and Wales have the authority to delete the article, I wonder why
they don't do it.)

Wikipedia's founder Jimmy Wales who also is/was the CEO of the porn
engine Boomis asks you to donate money to Wikipedia (Wikipiggy).
Don't  donate a cent!

Wikipedia is a destructive cult and its articles contain falsehoods,
rumours misspellings, bad grammar, false information, libel,
defamation, false light representations, half-truths,  invasion into
privacy, violation of privacy, copyright violations, etc.. They
collect also libel from other publishers and dump everything on
Wikipiggy.

Jimmy Wales allows his Wikipiggists to hide in anonymity, which means
that they feel they can come away with violations of rights and laws
as only few people can afford the expensive way of suing the
Wikipedia
cult.

It came to my attention that the average Wikipiggist (editor) is a
child, just 17 years old. Other Wikipiggists have a criminal history.
And they want to control what you learn and how you think. These
creeps want to control your mind.

There is no free speech on Wikipedia. This &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is NOT
democratic. It is controlled by gangs (editors, admins, etc.) who
block your IP number if they don't like that you have a
constitutional
right of free speech too.

Wikipedia is nothing but a lawless movement that wants to control
history, present time and the future with their definitions. By
donating to Wikipedia, you support a system that hates free speech of
opponents and critics  as much as the KGB or the Nazis did.

Sounds like the kind of scam, Norle Steven Goodman would fall for.
Reveal your ID and explain these idiots that you are not me. I would
not waste my time to post what you did.
