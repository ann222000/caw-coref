Hello,
I have been reading this forum for a few weeks now and thought
I would add-in.
To begin you guys are being a little hard on John aren't you? One
recent post actually called him a heretic. I thought we were saved by
our faith in Jesus and his sacrific for us on the cross, not by our
belief in when the rapture would come? Another person said he didn't
want them to be ready when Jesus comes back. How exactly do you &quot;get
ready&quot; for something like that? I think it is pretty obvious he is a
christian and whether he believes in pre or post trib rapture if he is
saved he is going up with Jesus anyway. If he is wrong, and Jesus
judges us that harshly for simply being wrong sometime then none of us
is going. Actually though he is MORE ready than a pre-trib rapture
believing christain, not less (I will explain more in a minute) Not
believing in the pre-trib timing of the rapture does not forfeit your
saved status with GOD, if it does please show it to me in the bible?
To judge him as unworthy to be raptured because of this is not
christian.
With that said, let me get this out of the way. I also do not
believe in a pre-trip rapture. Only one return of Jesus at the end.
Most people use the timeline of christians being raptured up and then
returning later with Jesus. But in the chapter where this is stated no
time period is actually given. It could be seven years or one second.
GOD sees time different than we do and can accomplish more in a second
than we could in an eternity. You are reading this as an earthly
mortal occurance, and restricted by mortal time, when it is obviously
a supernatural miracle of GOD himself.  I believe GOD can do anything,
anyone disagree?
But I debated it within myself for a long time, I could see
where both sides, pre and post, had good points. I finally decided
that since I was human, and imperfect I had to accept that no matter
what conclusion I came to I would have to also accept a certain
percent chance that I was wrong. Not even Jesus knows when he is to
come back, so to imply that I knew more than Jesus would be wrong. And
to assume that I was perfectly correct in knowing GOD's every move
would have put myself on level with GOD which is also wrong.
So I decided to go the safest right and prepare myself
spiritally and emotionally for tribulation, and to teach the people I
love, my family, to do the same thing. This is what John is doing. He
is not steering people away from GOD, but trying to teach them how to
prepare to keep thier faith in the face of INTENSE persecution.
Something most Christians in the world today have no clue about.  Many
Christians in china and korea and other countries are being murdered
and put in jail for YEARS because of thier belief in Jesus. I get
letters from Nigeria and Kenya every month detailing atrocities that
are happening RIGHT NOW in those countries. Villages being attack and
pastors being drug out of churches and killed in the street. Bibles
being taken from everyone in the village and burned. Entire christian
families being wiped out by muslims. Doesn't this sound like
tribulations to you? Do you think these christians are wondering where
Jesus is? Are they asking themselves where is the rapture? According
to your beliefs shouldn't they be? This is happening on a VERY large
scale in Africa. But do you see it on the news? Nope, not a peep. They
are starving, facing natural disasters and being slaughtered for thier
beliefs. If that is not tribulation what is???? And they have not been
raptured out, or we all should be gone now. After all, if the pre-trib
rapture is completely true then we all should have been raptured out
before this started anywhere in the world. Are they less christian
than we are? I would say the time for a pre-trip rapture has past, the
best we could hope for now would be some type of mid-trib rapture as
tribulations has already started for many christians in the world.
It's happening right now.
The bible states that in the end scoffers would be saying,
&quot;Where is the promise of his coming?&quot;. On first look at this verse we
think it is other athiest and faiths antagonizing Christians with this
question, but on close reading of it in context we see that it is an
introspective question being delivered by people who are losing thier
faith in the midst of the great tribulation.
Now who on the planet today would most likely fulfill this
part of prophecy? Who is looking for a way out before the great
tribulation hits? Are muslims looking for a pre-trib rapture? Are
atheists? Hindu's? Nope.
Thee only people who could fulfill this prophecy are people
who expected to be gone before any intense persecution begins. And
that would be pre-trib believing Christians, for they are the only
ones who believe that.

To be honest I &quot;hope&quot; the pre-tribbers are right. I am just as
ready to get out of this dying world as anyone else, but out of
concern for my family and my own future spiritual wellbeing I am
learning what is going to go on during the tribulation and already
starting to prepare myself and my family for it. The mark, the beast,
the signs. All of it. I want my faith to be firm and strong regardless
of how bad things might get if I do in fact end up in the middle of
it.
If they find themselves in the middle of it I want them to
understand WHY they are there and WHAT BELIEFS they are supposed to
hold too. I don't want them to end up a &quot;scoffer&quot; (christian who has
lost faith because of intense persecution)
And when I say INTENSE PERSECUTION I am not talking about the
things happening in the west, small scale persecution. I am talking
about muslims trying to cut off your head, or the government locking
you up for 10 years type of persecution. We have no idea what that is
like and the devil could use it to break us big time. The bible seems
to say he does.
I am not trying to take away anyone's &quot;hope&quot;. Keep it, you
will need it. But I cannot put my and my families eternal well being
in the belief of a pre-trib rapture when, as many of you have already
pointed out, it is not &quot;specifically&quot; written out. I wouldn't buy a
lottery ticket on wednesday and then quit my job on thursday &quot;hoping&quot;
that on saturday when they pulled the numbers I would win. I would
definately be &quot;HOPING&quot; but I wouldn't quit my job just yet.
To show the difference of what this type of thinking can do
let me tell you about a conversation I and my wife had recently.
She is a pre-tribber, I am not.
I asked her if she found herself having to take the mark to
survive could she decline it and face starvation or worse. Her answer
was, &quot;I would like to think I would say no, but at a time like that
how can you be sure exactly what you would do&quot;.
I responded, &quot;I would NOT TAKE IT. No matter what. I would
rather starve or suffer for GOD than give in&quot;. Of course I am human
and my break like anyone under the right circumstances but I can say
this NOW because I have prepared for it. Since she believes in a pre-
trib rapture she never thinks about it and even now, when she is under
NO REAL PRESSURE she cannot give a definate answer. How is she going
to be with a gun to her head or a sword to the back of her neck? When
the pressure is REALLY ON.
There is simply to much at stake, prepare yourself to run the
whole race for the Jesus, to truly show how strongly you BELIEVE.

GOD BLESS, ken elliott.

Hi Kinnith,

I did ask John if he was a Christian because over the years I have debated
with people assuming that they were and later found out that they were satan
worshippers, witches, cultists, etc. who had come not to learn of the Lord
but to teach us how wrong our beliefs are. We need to know who we are
talking to so that we can pray for them. In some cases (satanic worshippers
and witches) the member has demanded that we don't pray for them and fled.

John confesses the Lord and I (of course) believe him.

But many times a person sounds like a follower of the Lord and we have
invested months only to find out that our assumption was wrong. Sometimes
they fake it and act insulted that we would even ask. A true Christian is
happy and eager to confess Jesus as Lord and hopes someone will ask them.

Most Post-Tribbers don't come to these lists to &quot;encourage each other with
these words&quot;. Neither do they come to the lists to be good Bereans, to study
and draw closer to the Lord. They don't come to examine their beliefs, the
strengths and weaknesses and believe me all the rapture positions have
weaknesses. They don't come to learn of other positions. They come to
&quot;prove&quot; that they are right and we are wrong.

Johns insistence that he can prove the post-trib theory is classic. And when
we explained that the Bible is not proof but only evidence he claimed
evidence was not enough. Yet when shown the Scripture that FAITH is the
evidence of things unseen, he would not acknowledge it but instead continued
on his merry way to prove we (and the Bible) were wrong.

Years ago it was discovered that once a person chooses his rapture position
(not counting his denominational upbringing) he never changes. Upon learning
this, web sites and lists began to forbid the rapture topic and many
converted to pre-trib only.

You see Kinnith it's like this; each of us has a personal relationship with
the Lord. This is shown in John 21;22 and explained in James 1;23,24 where
we look into a mirror and see who we are. The mirror is the Bible and we see
Jesus whom we will become like (1 John 3;2,3).

Our rapture position is actually a reflection of our relationship!

Pre-Tribbers have a tendency to believe the Bible literally that Jesus
suffered 100% on the cross for them and so they don't need to &quot;tribulate&quot;.
Post-Tribbers believe Jesus died on the cross for them but they must also
suffer and Mid-Tribbers have a relationship somewhere in-between.

Your below post telling of the present Christian myrtars vividly shows your
relationship but I wonder if you have ever read Hebrews 11 where the myrtars
are listed and in the end it is stated that they hadn't received the promise
(Jesus at the cross) and we have so something better is for us if we have
faith for it.

Also your post tells us that you can't understand how someone prepares for
the Pre-Trib rapture and then you turn around and support preparing for the
Tribulation.

We Pre-Tribbers are having our hearts prepared by conforming to the Word
(the promises in trust) but you Post-Tribbers are preparing for the
Tribulation when satan will overcome the saints (Rev 13;7).

By the way, how does one prepare to have his head cut off? shave?

Jesus loves you Kinnith and doesn't want you to suffer the Tribulation just
as he doesn't want the myrtars of today to suffer. I know you can't accept
this because it just isn't in your make up that Jesus could love you that
much, but it is true.

Bob

BOB AMEN brother you tell it like it is!!

you see Kinnith it DOES Matter what view POST or PRE OR MID

because of one thing that our lord and god did on the cross for us!@!

HE ALREADY PAID OUR PRICE !!

you see when someone goes post or mid trib what they are saying (even
if they dont want to believe it)

THAT WHAT JESUS DID ON THE CROSS WASNT GOOD ENOUGH BUT THEY HAVE TO DO
MORE TO PROOVE THERE LOVE OR FAITH TO GOD

listen all here

IT DOES MATTER WHAT POSSITION YOU STAND ON !!
just as john pointed out , that those who are waiting and comforting
one eachother of the lords return for his own ,hIS BRIDE (US) are
looking for the LORD not the ANTI-CHRIST

rather you admit or believe it all post tribers and mid tribbers are
NOT PUTTING ALL THIER TRUST IN THE LORD !!
BUT THEY ARE IN OTHER POST TRIBBERS

as john also pointed out , all and i mean all post tribbers or mid
tribbers ATTACK THE PRE_TRIB poss
mmmmmmmm i wonder why!

the problem is that when you dont see the pre-trib rapture then you
only see tribulation not comfort and joy in the lord who is our
strentgh

anyway god bless and may the holy spirit give you UNDERSTANDING!!

Just a few things below on your reply. Thank you for reading my post.

">

I have no desire to &quot;prove&quot; that I am right. As I posted in my
initial article I accept that as an imperfect human being I have to
accept a certain percent chance I could be wrong. Something in all my
years I have yet to hear a pre-trib beliver admit too. In order to
claim to know something with 100 percent certainty that Jesus himself
doesn't even know would put you on level with GOD. Which is wrong.  My
only goal is to make sure that if people DO in fact find themselves in
the middle of great tribulation and intense persecution they will
think back on something I or another post-trib believer has written
and realize there ARE other possibilities and not to lose faith.
Remember what the bible says about the watchmen..

Ezek 33:2-7   &quot;Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and
say to them: 'When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of
the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman,
'when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet
and warns the people, 'then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and
does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his
blood shall be on his own head...........'But if the watchman sees the
sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not
warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he
is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the
watchman's hand.'  &quot;So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for
the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and
warn them for Me.  (NKJ)

...if you set yourself up as declaring to be a &quot;watchman&quot; for the end
times by preaching and teaching about it, and you are teaching the
wrong thing, then the end comes and people lose faith because of what
YOU have told them, you will be partially accountable for that loss to
GOD. I am simply doing what I feel GOD has taught me to do. I am being
watchful and telling others to be watchful also. When I see a sword
coming I will WARN you, not let you sit there and hope it misses.

I believed in the pre-trib rapture until I was 35 years old. I am now
38. After 3 years and much study I believe the evidence interpreted in
the bible leans towards a post-trib rapture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Our rapture position is actually a reflection of our relationship!
">

That is an opinion I do not agree with at all! As I said before my
salvation and acceptance of grace is not in any way connected to my
belief in when the rapture will occur. I love Jesus and strive to be
like him more everyday. Simply not knowing when the rapture will
happen has no bearing on that relationship. Jesus actually commanded
us to spread the gospel so our relationship with him should be much
more based on what WE can DO for HIM, and not what we &quot;think&quot; HE is
going to do for US by getting us out of here. Actually the pre-trib
position is the more self centered one as we become more concerned
about having GOD make things easy for us instead of concentrating on
following his word and commandments. I wish for the reflection of my
relationship with GOD to be my obedience to GOD, not his service to
ME. (ie rapture me)

Jesus did not die on the cross for us to not have to &quot;tribulate&quot;. His
death on the cross was to pay the penalty for sin that we all would
have had to pay in hell ourselves. Our salvation is to keep us from
hell, not to make our lives easier here. If it were to make our lives
here easier why are so many Christians going through famine,
pestilence, wars, and intense persecution now and in the past. Was his
sacrifice not enough to pay for thier suffering also? Are you saying
his sacrific was not sufficent? If YOU or your close family were going
through those persecutions now, as MANY christians are, would you
start to have doubts in your beliefs? I do not believe there is
anything more I can do for myself, and my suffering would add nothing
to my salvation, it is bought and paid for in full. But Jesus left us
with commands and a mission, I am simply following them. I only wish
to be strong enough to stand up for my beliefs and convictions no
matter what the future may hold.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; By the way, how does one prepare to have his head cut off? shave?
">

You are correct, I am preparing because I do not want to be overcome
by Satan. As far as &quot;how do I prepare&quot;? I read the bible, I pray, I
learn what there is to expect. I, as commanded by Jesus, &quot;watch, am
alert, and focus on not being caught unawares&quot;. I go to college, and
if I have a test coming up I study for the test so as not to fail it
when the time comes to take that test. If I did not study and prepare
I most likely would fail. Most Christians today are not studying for
that final test.
Now think a minute...
WHO would want YOU (a Christian) to NOT study for THAT test? Who would
benefit the MOST from a Pre-Trib rapture belief if, just follow me
here, hypothetically thinking, it wasn't true? Where would most
christians suddenly be?
My bet is after a few weeks of starving they would be down at the DMV
putting thier right hand out to have thier verichip installed? Right.
(Just a thought)
I do not want to fail for Jesus after what he did for me. I have been
saved, my salvation is guaranteed &quot;UNLESS&quot;, and it is entirely
possibly, people do it all the time even now, &quot;UNLESS&quot; I turn my back
on Jesus, by suddenly blashpheming against him by declaring HE and GOD
do not exist because I suddenly find myself in great tribulation with
no rapture having been had.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Jesus loves you Kinnith and doesn't want you to suffer the Tribulation just
&gt; as he doesn't want the myrtars of today to suffer. I know you can't accept
&gt; this because it just isn't in your make up that Jesus could love you that
&gt; much, but it is true.
">

You don't know me Bob, you have no idea what my &quot;make up&quot; is. To
assume you do is to assume you have some power you obviously could not
have. Jesus loves me, GOD loves me, but even more importantly I love
THEM enough not to take thier gifts for granted. I do not have to do
ANYTHING for my salvation but accept it. But at any time I still draw
breath on this earth I can decline it, and I don't want to risk ANYONE
being able to force or coerce me to do that because I was too weak and
unprepared to stand up and declare my dicipleship to GOD.

Put yourself in the shoes of those martyrs in Africa Bob. As you read
this someone is serving a 10 year sentence simply for saying I believe
in Jesus. Someone else is being horribly beaten, someone's father is
being dragged through the jungle headed for a shallow grave because he
refused to deny Jesus Christ. It IS happening, right now. And those
people are just as important to Jesus as YOU are. For just a minute,
forgot about the timing of the rapture Bob.

Are you strong enough, and prepared enough to NOT deny Christ in that
situation?  If not, what are you doing to get prepared. If you do not
think you will ever go through that kind of persecution why were you
chosen to escape it over those Christians? Why was your salvation more
potent for saving you from earthly tribulations than thiers is? If
Jesus's death was to save us from tribulations on this earth AS WELL
AS the penalty of sin after our death, why is that happening now? Was
Jesus's death not sufficient for us all?
please explain.

thanks,

from damnation and enter into heaven with him. Not so we could have it
easier here on earth. If what you believe is true why are so many
christians on earth suffering great tribulation right now? Was the
sacrifice of Jesus not sufficent to cover thier suffering as well as
your own? By your beliefs apparently it was not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you see when someone goes post or mid trib what they are saying (even
&gt; if they dont want to believe it)
&gt; THAT WHAT JESUS DID ON THE CROSS WASNT GOOD ENOUGH BUT THEY HAVE TO DO
&gt; MORE TO PROOVE THERE LOVE OR FAITH TO GOD
">

This is an assumption on your part. I could easily turn it around and
say GOD delivered the Jews through thier tribulations in Egypt while
they were still in Egypt, GOD delivered Noah through the tribulations
of his time while he was still in the world. In neither instance did
GOD need to remove his people from the earth, he saved them in the
midst of chaos which is even more miraculous. I could easily say Pre-
tribbers by thier beliefs are saying they do not have faith that GOD
could deliver them through their future tribulations. But since I do
not know all pre-trib believers personally to make such a blanket
statement would not only be illogical but slightly immoral as I would
be prejudging thier strength of faith in GOD, which I have no right to
do. And neither do you.
You already claim to know more than Jesus by knowing the timeframe of
his return, are you now saying you have the wisdom to sit in judgement
of people you don't even know?

I look to comfort my Christian brothers and sisters in times of strife
just as much as I work to strengthen them in thier faith for times of
tribulation. You don't have to just settle for comfort. You can have
strength also, they are not mutually exclusive.

Actually I am putting my faith in GOD, as I know beyond a doubt HE
will always be there for me. My worry, My QUESTION is that in times of
great tribulation that I will always be strong enough to be there for
HIM. I have no doubt in GOD assurances of my deliverance, my doubts
are on the world and the chaotic and deceptive nature of it and it's
power to pull christians AWAY from GOD. The world pulls christians
away every day, even now in American, when are persecutions are
slight. What are those same Christians going to do if they find
themselves here when the &quot;REAL&quot; pressure is on. If they do not have
the resolve now to continue to be faithful because of life's troubles
because they have not prayed on and studied bible prophecy, how are
they going to be ready if there is no pre-trib rapture. They WILL fall
away. The bible talks about a great falling away.
Who do you think are the christians who are falling away are? please
explain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; as john also pointed out , all and i mean all post tribbers or mid
&gt; tribbers ATTACK THE PRE_TRIB poss
&gt; mmmmmmmm i wonder why!

because we don't want to deny GOD and send myself to hell? That's my
reason. Also, I think I have been polite and respectful, if any other
tone has been read into my posts by the reader I cannot control that.
I do not see where I have attacked anyone. I have even expressed hope
that the pre-tribbers are correct, I do not see where that is an
attack?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the problem is that when you dont see the pre-trib rapture then you

the LORD will be my strength ALWAYS, not just when I am experiencing
comfort and joy. I understand that completely.

Please remember to answer this question for me, I would appreciate
it.

Who do you think are the christians who are falling away are? To be
more specific what do you think happened to them to cause them to fall
away? please explain.  (note: please do not reply that the fallen away
were not christian to begin with, how could non-christians fall away

Hi Kinnith,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That is an opinion I do not agree with at all! As I said before my
&gt; salvation and acceptance of grace is not in any way connected to my
&gt; belief in when the rapture will occur. I love Jesus and strive to be
&gt; like him more everyday. Simply not knowing when the rapture will
&gt; happen has no bearing on that relationship. Jesus actually commanded
&gt; us to spread the gospel so our relationship with him should be much
&gt; more based on what WE can DO for HIM, and not what we &quot;think&quot; HE is
&gt; going to do for US by getting us out of here. Actually the pre-trib
&gt; position is the more self centered one as we become more concerned
&gt; about having GOD make things easy for us instead of concentrating on
&gt; following his word and commandments. I wish for the reflection of my
&gt; relationship with GOD to be my obedience to GOD, not his service to
&gt; ME. (ie rapture me)
">

Jesus did it all for us on the cross, everything else is our own works and
described in the Bible as filthy rags (Isa 64;6).

We don't &quot;think&quot; Jesus is going to do it for us we &quot;believe&quot; He has done it
all on the cross.

All else is self righteous works.

Going into the Tribulation to &quot;suffer for Jesus&quot; is self righteous religious
pride.

Do you know why Job (a righteous man, Job 1;8) was turned over to satan? You
will find the answer in Job 41;34, I suggest you read it and don't make his
mistake.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jesus did not die on the cross for us to not have to &quot;tribulate&quot;. His
&gt; death on the cross was to pay the penalty for sin that we all would
&gt; have had to pay in hell ourselves. Our salvation is to keep us from
&gt; hell, not to make our lives easier here. If it were to make our lives
&gt; here easier why are so many Christians going through famine,
&gt; pestilence, wars, and intense persecution now and in the past. Was his
&gt; sacrifice not enough to pay for thier suffering also? Are you saying
&gt; his sacrific was not sufficent? If YOU or your close family were going
&gt; through those persecutions now, as MANY christians are, would you
&gt; start to have doubts in your beliefs? I do not believe there is
&gt; anything more I can do for myself, and my suffering would add nothing
&gt; to my salvation, it is bought and paid for in full. But Jesus left us
&gt; with commands and a mission, I am simply following them. I only wish
&gt; to be strong enough to stand up for my beliefs and convictions no
&gt; matter what the future may hold.
">

Ephesians 2;8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should
boast.

If a person suffers for Jesus in the Tribulation he would be able to boast
about it. This shows that anything but grace is works.

It simply amazes me that people will fight for the right to tribulate when
Jesus already paid the price on the cross to extend the promise of escape.
Can't you understand that Jesus loves you and made a way for you? Or is it
that you doubt God is able to?

God wants you to trust Him, that is our works; trusting in His grace.

&gt; You are correct, I am preparing because I do not want to be overcome

&gt; learn what there is to expect. I, as commanded by Jesus, &quot;watch, am
&gt; alert, and focus on not being caught unawares&quot;. I go to college, and
&gt; if I have a test coming up I study for the test so as not to fail it
&gt; when the time comes to take that test. If I did not study and prepare
&gt; I most likely would fail. Most Christians today are not studying for
&gt; that final test.
&gt; Now think a minute...
&gt; WHO would want YOU (a Christian) to NOT study for THAT test? Who would

&gt; I do not want to fail for Jesus after what he did for me. I have been

&gt; possibly, people do it all the time even now, &quot;UNLESS&quot; I turn my back

&gt; no rapture having been had.

We prepare our hearts for the Lord we don't prepare for some Tribulation
test.

We wait and look for Him not satan and not the Tribulation.

No Kinnith, I am not strong enough and neither is any person on this planet.

It is Jesus in us that can do it.

And we can not earn Jesus in us.
We can not earn His love and mercy.

Again I urge you to read Hebrews 11. In it you will find a description of
those faithful who suffered and died for God. Be sure not to miss verses 39

In verse 40 you will also find a reference to the resurrection and rapture.

Now before I answer your question; &quot;Was Jesus's death not sufficient for us

You guys use the word faith alot. But I don't see where you really
understand what that means. We are saved by our faith in Jesus, but
the bible clearly shows there are two kinds of faith. Faith that is
productive in a tangleble way and faith that is worthless because it
does noting. Faith without tangeble effort is just a word and GOD
knows that. You quoted Ephesians, but you stopped a little short in
the New Testemant Bob. Mine goes on to say...

James 2:17 So also faith, if it does not have works (deeds and actions
of obedience to back it up), by itself is destitute of power
(inoperative, dead).
James 2:20 Are you willing to be shown [proof], you foolish
(unporductive, spritually deficient) fellow, that faith apart from
[good] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless
James 2:22 You see that his faith was cooperating with his good works,
and [his] faith was COMPLETED and reached its SUPREME ESPRESSION [when
he implemented it] by [good] works.
James 2:26 For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless, so
faith apart from its works of Obedience is also dead.

These are not my words, they are GOD's. And obviously, definately
refer to tangible WORKS to show thier is substance to a man's faith. I
do not think he would emphesize something 4 times in a row, over and
over again if he did not think it was important. Let's see what Jesus
has to say about it in HIS own words. Below is Jesus HIMSELF
explaining judgement day, lets see what HE SAYS his criteria for
believing your faith is true will be....

Matthew 25:31-46
31&quot;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. 32All the nations
will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from
another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33He will
put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
34&quot;Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are
blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for
you since the creation of the world. 35For I was hungry and you gave
me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,
I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36I needed clothes and you
clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and
you came to visit me.'
37&quot;Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you
hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
38When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes
and clothe you? 39When did we see you sick or in prison and go to
visit you?'
40&quot;The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for
one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
41&quot;Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who
are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was
thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43I was a stranger and you
did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I
was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
44&quot;They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or
thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did
not help you?'
45&quot;He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do
for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
46&quot;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous
to eternal life.&quot;

According to Jesus in his OWN words the worth of your FAITH will be
decided by what you tangebly DID. Did you feed the hungry? clothe the
naked? help the sick? visit the criminals? These are all tangeble
actions.
To say Faith is determined by some wispy, intangeble idea. Just a word
spoken in the air is obviousldy by the above versus wrong. That idea
is not being supported in any of the above verses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Why would you use Job's story? It is the story of a man put through
his own tribulations to prove to Satan his faith was strong, too
strong for Satan to break. Job's story is just a miniature version of
the Christians going into tribulation, holding out against intense
persecution, and being redemed at the end because of thier conviction
and faith in GOD. Of course Job stumbles, doubts, get's angry and
discouraged at times along the way, but he is only human. Also the
suffering he went through was TANGEBLE REAL suffering, not something
that just went on inside his head. Job's story supports what I believe
more than it supports what you believe. If it supported what you
believe Job should have just been able to &quot;say&quot;, &quot;LORD, I have faith
in you&quot; and he would never of had to go through anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ephesians 2;8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of

Yes, you are SAVED BY GRACE, not faith. You are given grace by showing
you have faith that is substantial. Not just a word you have used or
some feeling you having generated in your heart.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You are making a blanket assumption that every human being is
boastful, when many of us work to be as humble as possible. I
personnaly think pride is disgraceful. If I were to suffer through
tribulation to get to GOD I would not boast of it to anyone. I would
be thankful he carried me through it just as I had FAITH he would.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It simply amazes me that people will fight for the right to tribulate when

&gt; that you doubt God is able to?
">

I do not see where I am fighting to go through tribulation. It's the
LAST thing I WANT to do. You are making another assumption here that
that is what I want to do. I do not WANT to go through it, I just WANT
to be prepared if I have to go thorugh it it. That is two different
things. Jesus made a way for me to avoid hell, not to avoid having to
show a strong witness for him while I am here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Actually we have not been saved under all circumstance, if we
blasphemy against him we are not saved. That's what I am preparing not
to do and teaching others NOT to do.
I do trust HIM, it's Satan I do not trust. Until I am standing before
Jesus in the air I have been told to &quot;guard my heart&quot; against such
things by Jesus himself. So that is what I will do and what I will
teach others to do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Trust Jesus Kinnith, He won't let you down even if your flesh is weak.

I do trust in Jesus Bob, it's Satan and people who tell me not to obey
what my bible tells me to do that I don't trust.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Please read Hebrews 11;39,40.
&gt; In verse 40 you will also find a reference to the resurrection and rapture.

Yes I have. It shows were the Jews having upheld the law to a point
still did not recieve salvation because they did not accept Jesus. It
has nothing to do with getting out of hardships on earth because of
the crucifixtion. It has to do with the Jews missing out on salvation
for denying Jesus.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We can not earn His love and mercy.

I am not trying to &quot;earn&quot; his love. I am putting actions to my faith
so that it actually MEANS something. There is a difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We can only trust.

No we can actually get up off our rumps and DO SOMETHING. Plenty of
oppurtunities all over the world to fulfill what Jesus asked of us in
Matthew 25. If you need something check out my webpage at www.call2christ.org
and help me get some of these bibles shipped into africa. I spent
every free dime I had doing it and now im broke and have 500 bibles
still here to be shipped.
Or maybe I can just pray and have &quot;faith&quot; that they will get there and
tommorrow morning when I wake up they will be gone? We were told to
&quot;spread the gospel&quot;, I am inviting you to help me do that right now.
interested???

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would like to ask you a question so that I may be better able to explain;
&gt; What is the &quot;strong meat&quot; as described in Hebrews 5,6 ?
">

The strong meat is a more full understanding of scripture and a deeper
understanding of faith, grace and our relationship with GOD. So I
assume, and I may be wrong as it's easy to read things into text, that
you are trying to say I am still on the milk?
We pretty much negate each other out on that point Bob as I see you
the same way. Still on the milk.
I realize I started this one by skewing off into the area of faith,
but as we seem to be discussing the point that are belief in the
timing of the rapture shows the measure of our faith it still seemed
appropriate.

first of all kinnith the FALLING AWAY IS so called christians
(catholics.Mormons ect.. those that believe there are many paths to
salvation !! AND i ALSO NOTICED IN YOUR POST YOU SAY THEM like God AND
JESUS are different THEY ARE NOT

the son is god manifested!
the father is god invisable
the holy spirit is god in interaction with his creation!

there are NO THEY!!
also i noticed that you think because we say that jesus paid the price
already you think were saying that we believe what jesus did wasnt
sufficiant WRONG!

listen kinn you post alot of scriptures but i also see that you have
no understanding of what you post

please read 1 Cor 2:14

and also kinn im just guessing but are you trying to say that the
Falling Away is Pre-tribbers

just asking

the falling away kinn is the falling away from the truth the real
truth
read Mathew about the 10 virgins

just because you post alot of scriptures doesnt make it true!!

when jesus died on the cross HIS DEATH WAS AND IS MORE THEN
SUFFICIANT ! THATS WHY AS THE BRIDE OR CHURCH WE ARE NOT THE OBJECT OF
GODS WRATH !!

AND ALSO READ WHERE SATAN IS PREVIELING AGAINST THE SAINTS !!
DID NOT JESUS HIMSELF  TELL US THAT SATAN CAN PREVIEL AGAINST US ?

YES HE DID !! PRAISE JESUS MY LORD AND MY GOD !!

&gt; his own tribulations to prove to Satan his faith was strong, too
&gt; strong for Satan to break. Job's story is just a miniature version of
&gt; the Christians going into tribulation, holding out against intense
&gt; persecution, and being redemed at the end because of thier conviction
&gt; and faith in GOD. Of course Job stumbles, doubts, get's angry and
&gt; discouraged at times along the way, but he is only human. Also the
&gt; suffering he went through was TANGEBLE REAL suffering, not something
&gt; that just went on inside his head. Job's story supports what I believe
&gt; more than it supports what you believe. If it supported what you
&gt; believe Job should have just been able to &quot;say&quot;, &quot;LORD, I have faith
&gt; in you&quot; and he would never of had to go through anything.

&gt; &gt; Ephesians 2;8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
&gt; &gt; yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should
&gt; &gt; boast.

&gt; Yes, you are SAVED BY GRACE, not faith. You are given grace by showing
&gt; you have faith that is substantial. Not just a word you have used or
&gt; some feeling you having generated in your heart.

&gt; &gt; If a person suffers for Jesus in the Tribulation he would be able to boast
&gt; &gt; about it. This shows that anything but grace is works.

&gt; You are making a blanket assumption that every human being is
&gt; boastful, when many of us work to be as humble as possible. I
&gt; personnaly think pride is disgraceful. If I were to suffer through
&gt; tribulation to get to GOD I would not boast of it to anyone. I would
&gt; be thankful he carried me through it just as I had FAITH he would.

&gt; &gt; It simply amazes me that people will fight for the right to tribulate when
&gt; &gt; Jesus already paid the price on the cross to extend the promise of escape.
&gt; &gt; Can't you understand that Jesus loves you and made a way for you? Or is it
&gt; &gt; that you doubt God is able to?

&gt; I do not see where I am fighting to go through tribulation. It's the
&gt; LAST thing I WANT to do. You are making another assumption here that
&gt; that is what I want to do. I do not WANT to go through it, I just WANT
&gt; to be prepared if I have to go thorugh it it. That is two different
&gt; things. Jesus made a way for me to avoid hell, not to avoid having to
&gt; show a strong witness for him while I am here.

&gt; &gt;&gt;God wants you to trust Him, that is our works; trusting in His grace.

&gt; According to James and Mathew above our &quot;works&quot; are tangible efforts.
&gt; The LORD's words not mine.

&gt; &gt; We wait and look for Him not satan and not the Tribulation.

&gt; Yes, that's exactly what Satan is hoping you will do.

&gt; &gt; I see you don't believe that Jesus has promised that you are saved under all
&gt; &gt; circumstances.
&gt; &gt; Trust Him Kinnith, He will never let you down.

&gt; Actually we have not been saved under all circumstance, if we
&gt; blasphemy against him we are not saved. That's what I am preparing not
&gt; to do and teaching others NOT to do.
&gt; I do trust HIM, it's Satan I do not trust. Until I am standing before
&gt; Jesus in the air I have been told to &quot;guard my heart&quot; against such
&gt; things by Jesus himself. So that is what I will do and what I will
&gt; teach others to do.

&gt; &gt; Trust Jesus Kinnith, He won't let you down even if your flesh is weak.

&gt; I do trust in Jesus Bob, it's Satan and people who tell me not to obey
&gt; what my bible tells me to do that I don't trust.

&gt; &gt; Please read Hebrews 11;39,40.
&gt; &gt; In verse 40 you will also find a reference to the resurrection and rapture.

&gt; Yes I have. It shows were the Jews having upheld the law to a point
&gt; still did not recieve salvation because they did not accept Jesus. It
&gt; has nothing to do with getting out of hardships on earth because of
&gt; the crucifixtion. It has to do with the Jews missing out on salvation
&gt; for denying Jesus.

&gt; &gt; We can not earn His love and mercy.

&gt; I am not trying to &quot;earn&quot; his love. I am putting actions to my faith
&gt; so that it actually MEANS something. There is a difference.

&gt; &gt; We can only trust.

&gt; No we can actually get up off our rumps and DO SOMETHING. Plenty of
&gt; oppurtunities all over the world to fulfill what Jesus asked of us in
&gt; Matthew 25. If you need something check out my webpage at www.call2christ.org
&gt; and help me get some of these bibles shipped into africa. I spent

Kinnith,

Faith without works is dead.

You have spoken this well, but did you notice what the work of God is?

John 6; 28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?
29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye
believe on him whom he hath sent.

You have quoted from James, here is a little bit more;

1; 22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
selves.
1; 27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
unspotted from the world.

Did you notice that suffering for Jesus is not included in the works?

Did you not notice in the Matthew 25 passage you quoted that there is no
suffering for Jesus?

It's like this Kinnith; the works are Jesus' works, through us, not our
filthy rags of works.
He gets all the praise.
We boast upon Him not upon our works.

It doesn't please God for us to suffer through the Tribulation or at any
time.
What kind of God do you think we serve anyway?
Did Jesus not suffer for us?
Did Jesus not give 100% of His life?

Must we now suffer also because Jesus' gift was not sufficient?
Will we repay the price a second time?

Kinnith Job didn't go through suffering to prove his faith was strong.
Did you read the Scripture I asked you to?

God told Job in Job 41; 34, that satan is the king of the children of pride!

Job had religious pride because of his continuous sacrificing 1;5 (he was
supposed to sacrifice once and stand in faith on it just as we sacrificed
Jesus once [Heb 7;27] ) but Job was religiously prideful. This can also be
seen in his defense to his friends that he was righteous.

After God told Job he was prideful Job repented starting in the very next
verse.
Then God told Job to make a sacrifice and He restored Job twice over.

By misreading the Scriptures you seek to justify your rapture position
exactly as Job justified his works to his friends. But there is one
difference; Job repented.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, you are SAVED BY GRACE, not faith. You are given grace by showing

Out of your very mouth comes the root of the problem; grace is free, we
don't get it by &quot;showing&quot; we have faith - that is works.

We can't earn grace or it wouldn't be grace (Rom 11;6).

It is by grace that we are saved through faith (NOT through &quot;showing&quot; we
have faith).

I would say this statement of yours speaks volumes and you should print it
out along with the appropriate verse and put it somewhere that you will see
it every morning when awaking and every night when retiring. Memorize the
verse God gives you after prayer.

All the rest of your statements are easily seen to be based upon this one
error;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes every human being is boastful.

Yes we would &quot;work&quot; to be humble but guess what, we could still possibly
boast about and so it is not from God.

Examine the Scriptures for your self.
When Paul was weak He was strong.
God chose Gedeon as he hid and made sure that Israel could not boast in
themselves for the victory.
We are in clay vessels to show that this power comes from God and not from
us.
There are too many examples to quote.

&gt; &quot;spread the gospel&quot;, I am inviting you to help me do that right now.
&gt; interested???

Are you boasting?

Jesus said to not even let your left hand know what your right hand is
doing.

The Pharisees were also full of good works.
Remember what Jesus said about them.

Yes! you should pray.

&gt; We pretty much negate each other out on that point Bob as I see you
&gt; the same way. Still on the milk.
&gt; I realize I started this one by skewing off into the area of faith,
&gt; but as we seem to be discussing the point that are belief in the
&gt; timing of the rapture shows the measure of our faith it still seemed
&gt; appropriate.

&gt; Your Turn,
">

No Kinnith the strong meat is not a deeper understanding of the Scriptures.
Many men (scholars) know the Bible very well but when not mixed with faith
it is of no profit. Heb 4;2.

The strong meat is the promises of God.
Please see Heb 5 and 6 (summed up in 6:12)

Yes God will not forget your good works (6;10) but you are expected to go
forward into the promises (6;9).

The Bible is full of promises of escape from the coming Tribulation Period.
But, as Heb 5 and 6 explains, if you don't move forward into the promises
you will slip back into works. Yes you will still be saved and Yes your
works will still be remembered by God.

God bless,

Bob

I could use some encouragement.

My goal is to live for (trusting) Jesus NOW, not spending my life preparing
to die for Jesus in the Tribulation.

Encourage me to not be selfish and untrusting in His Grace.
Encourage me to keep my eyes on Him (and not the coming Tribulation).
Encourage me that He loves me.
Encourage me in His promise to save me for eternity.
Encourage me that God is not a man that He should lie.

No, Jesus said giving up ones life is how to love - NOT suffering.
Please re-read your verse.

Jesus died (and suffered) FOR us so that we can live for Him.

If we say we believe we should suffer and die for Jesus, and if we don't
immediately do so (as in yesterday), we are hypocrites.

Bob

PS It takes much more faith and courage to lay down our lives for Jesus
(living for Jesus) then to commit suicide (die for Jesus). Any Muslim can
commit suicide for their god but how many have the faith to live a life of
love and forgiveness ? That kind of faith can only come from the true God of
glory - in us.

Dear Friends,

Why discuss whether or not there will be rapture, and when it will take place? Only those who will fight for the Body of Christ, His Dwelling place on earth, will be taken up. Only those who will lay down their lives for the brethren, regardless of race of doctrine, will have the Lord's eyes guiding them.

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the Lord will show: His plan.
the first believers were called, 'In the Way&quot; because Jesus is the Truth, the Life and the Way.
His Life must first be evdient in us. It is the only way to overcome the satanic plans to devour BELIEVERS.
Islam, and the other idolatry among the nations of the whole world can be overcome by the strength of ONE: One body of CHRIST.  Not one body of Christians, here there and everwhere.

There is a difference and the Lord is looking for those who will LAY DOWN THEIR AGENDAS to come before  Him on their knees to ask for this. Only the Exchanged Life (Galatians 2:20) will do.

All others will be left wondering why they weren't raptured.

&gt; You guys use the word faith alot. But I don't see where you really

&gt; the bible clearly shows there are two kinds of faith. Faith that is
&gt; productive in a tangleble way and faith that is worthless because it
&gt; does noting. Faith without tangeble effort is just a word and GOD
&gt; knows that. You quoted Ephesians, but you stopped a little short in
&gt; the New Testemant Bob. Mine goes on to say...

&gt; James 2:17 So also faith, if it does not have works (deeds and actions
&gt; of obedience to back it up), by itself is destitute of power
&gt; (inoperative, dead).
&gt; James 2:20 Are you willing to be shown [proof], you foolish
&gt; (unporductive, spritually deficient) fellow, that faith apart from
&gt; [good] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless
&gt; James 2:22 You see that his faith was cooperating with his good works,
&gt; and [his] faith was COMPLETED and reached its SUPREME ESPRESSION [when
&gt; he implemented it] by [good] works.
&gt; James 2:26 For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless, so
&gt; faith apart from its works of Obedience is also dead.

&gt; These are not my words, they are GOD's. And obviously, definately
&gt; refer to tangible WORKS to show thier is substance to a man's faith. I
&gt; do not think he would emphesize something 4 times in a row, over and
&gt; over again if he did not think it was important. Let's see what Jesus
&gt; has to say about it in HIS own words. Below is Jesus HIMSELF
&gt; explaining judgement day, lets see what HE SAYS his criteria for
&gt; believing your faith is true will be....

&gt; Matthew 25:31-46
&gt; 31&quot;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
&gt; him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. 32All the nations
&gt; will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from
&gt; another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33He will
&gt; put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
&gt; 34&quot;Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are
&gt; blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for
&gt; you since the creation of the world. 35For I was hungry and you gave
&gt; me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,
&gt; I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36I needed clothes and you
&gt; clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and
&gt; you came to visit me.'
&gt; 37&quot;Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you
&gt; hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
&gt; 38When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes
&gt; and clothe you? 39When did we see you sick or in prison and go to
&gt; visit you?'
&gt; 40&quot;The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for
&gt; one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
&gt; 41&quot;Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who
&gt; are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
&gt; angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was
&gt; thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43I was a stranger and you
&gt; did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I
&gt; was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
&gt; 44&quot;They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or
&gt; thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did
&gt; not help you?'
&gt; 45&quot;He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do
&gt; for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
&gt; 46&quot;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous
&gt; to eternal life.&quot;

&gt; According to Jesus in his OWN words the worth of your FAITH will be
&gt; decided by what you tangebly DID. Did you feed the hungry? clothe the
&gt; naked? help the sick? visit the criminals? These are all tangeble
&gt; actions.
&gt; To say Faith is determined by some wispy, intangeble idea. Just a word
&gt; spoken in the air is obviousldy by the above versus wrong. That idea
&gt; is not being supported in any of the above verses.

&gt; &gt; Do you know why Job (a righteous man, Job 1;8) was turned over to satan? You
&gt; &gt; will find the answer in Job 41;34, I suggest you read it and don't make his
&gt; &gt; mistake.

&gt; Why would you use Job's story? It is the story of a man put through
&gt; his own tribulations to prove to Satan his faith was strong, too
&gt; strong for Satan to break. Job's story is just a miniature version of
&gt; the Christians going into tribulation, holding out against intense
&gt; persecution, and being redemed at the end because of thier conviction
&gt; and faith in GOD. Of course Job stumbles, doubts, get's angry and
&gt; discouraged at times along the way, but he is only human. Also the
&gt; suffering he went through was TANGEBLE REAL suffering, not something
&gt; that just went on inside his head. Job's story supports what I believe
&gt; more than it supports what you believe. If it supported what you
&gt; believe Job should have just been able to &quot;say&quot;, &quot;LORD, I have faith
&gt; in you&quot; and he would never of had to go through anything.

&gt; &gt; Ephesians 2;8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
&gt; &gt; yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should
&gt; &gt; boast.

&gt; Yes, you are SAVED BY GRACE, not faith. You are given grace by showing
&gt; you have faith that is substantial. Not just a word you have used or
&gt; some feeling you having generated in your heart.

&gt; &gt; If a person suffers for Jesus in the Tribulation he would be able to boast
&gt; &gt; about it. This shows that anything but grace is works.

&gt; You are making a blanket assumption that every human being is
&gt; boastful, when many of us work to be as humble as possible. I
&gt; personnaly think pride is disgraceful. If I were to suffer through

&gt; I do not see where I am fighting to go through tribulation. It's the

&gt; that is what I want to do. I do not WANT to go through it, I just WANT

&gt; Yes, that's exactly what Satan is hoping you will do.

&gt; &gt; I see you don't believe that Jesus has promised that you are saved under all
&gt; &gt; circumstances.
&gt; &gt; Trust Him Kinnith, He will never let you down.

&gt; Actually we have not been saved under all circumstance, if we
&gt; blasphemy against him we are not saved. That's what I am preparing not
&gt; to do and teaching others NOT to do.
&gt; I do trust HIM, it's Satan I do not trust. Until I am standing before
&gt; Jesus in the air I have been told to &quot;guard my heart&quot; against such
&gt; things by Jesus himself. So that is what I will do and what I will
&gt; teach others to do.

&gt; &gt; Trust Jesus Kinnith, He won't let you down even if your flesh is weak.

Trish,

Thank you so much for pointing out Gal 2;20 to us.
What a beautiful passage.

19For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
20I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
21I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

This passage says that we can't obtain grace by the Law.
Do you think that if we break the Law we could lose grace?

Colossians 3;1-5 is a similar passage.

Bob

There is a difference and the Lord is looking for those who will LAY DOWN THEIR AGENDAS to come before  Him on their knees to ask for this. Only the Exchanged Life (Galatians 2:20) will do.

All others will be left wondering why they weren't raptured.

&gt; James 2:17 So also faith, if it does not have works (deeds and actions

&gt; (inoperative, dead).
&gt; James 2:20 Are you willing to be shown [proof], you foolish
&gt; (unporductive, spritually deficient) fellow, that faith apart from
&gt; [good] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless
&gt; James 2:22 You see that his faith was cooperating with his good works,
&gt; and [his] faith was COMPLETED and reached its SUPREME ESPRESSION [when
&gt; he implemented it] by [good] works.
&gt; James 2:26 For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless, so
&gt; faith apart from its works of Obedience is also dead.

&gt; These are not my words, they are GOD's. And obviously, definately
&gt; refer to tangible WORKS to show thier is substance to a man's faith. I
&gt; do not think he would emphesize something 4 times in a row, over and
&gt; over again if he did not think it was important. Let's see what Jesus
&gt; has to say about it in HIS own words. Below is Jesus HIMSELF
&gt; explaining judgement day, lets see what HE SAYS his criteria for
&gt; believing your faith is true will be....

&gt; Matthew 25:31-46
&gt; 31&quot;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
&gt; him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. 32All the nations
&gt; will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from
&gt; another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33He will
&gt; put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
&gt; 34&quot;Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are
&gt; blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for
&gt; you since the creation of the world. 35For I was hungry and you gave
&gt; me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,
&gt; I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36I needed clothes and you
&gt; clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and
&gt; you came to visit me.'
&gt; 37&quot;Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you
&gt; hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
&gt; 38When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes
&gt; and clothe you? 39When did we see you sick or in prison and go to
&gt; visit you?'
&gt; 40&quot;The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for
&gt; one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
&gt; 41&quot;Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who
&gt; are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
&gt; angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was
&gt; thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43I was a stranger and you
&gt; did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I
&gt; was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
&gt; 44&quot;They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or
&gt; thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did
&gt; not help you?'
&gt; 45&quot;He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do
&gt; for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
&gt; 46&quot;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous
&gt; to eternal life.&quot;

&gt; According to Jesus in his OWN words the worth of your FAITH will be
&gt; decided by what you tangebly DID. Did you feed the hungry? clothe the
&gt; naked? help the sick? visit the criminals? These are all tangeble
&gt; actions.
&gt; To say Faith is determined by some wispy, intangeble idea. Just a word
&gt; spoken in the air is obviousldy by the above versus wrong. That idea
&gt; is not being supported in any of the above verses.

&gt; &gt; Do you know why Job (a righteous man, Job 1;8) was turned over to satan? You
&gt; &gt; will find the answer in Job 41;34, I suggest you read it and don't make his
&gt; &gt; mistake.

&gt; Why would you use Job's story? It is the story of a man put through
&gt; his own tribulations to prove to Satan his faith was strong, too
&gt; strong for Satan to break. Job's story is just a miniature version of
&gt; the Christians going into tribulation, holding out against intense
&gt; persecution, and being redemed at the end because of thier conviction
&gt; and faith in GOD. Of course Job stumbles, doubts, get's angry and
&gt; discouraged at times along the way, but he is only human. Also the
&gt; suffering he went through was TANGEBLE REAL suffering, not something
&gt; that just went on inside his head. Job's story supports what I believe
&gt; more than it supports what you believe. If it supported what you
&gt; believe Job should have just been able to &quot;say&quot;, &quot;LORD, I have faith
&gt; in you&quot; and he would never of had to go through anything.

&gt; &gt; Ephesians 2;8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
&gt; &gt; yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should
&gt; &gt; boast.

&gt; Yes, you are SAVED BY GRACE, not faith. You are given grace by showing
&gt; you have faith that is substantial. Not just a word you have used or
&gt; some feeling you having generated in your heart.

&gt; &gt; If a person suffers for Jesus in the Tribulation he would be able to boast
&gt; &gt; about it. This shows that anything but grace is works.

&gt; You are making a blanket assumption that every human being is
&gt; boastful, when many of us work to be as humble as possible. I
&gt; personnaly think pride is disgraceful. If I were to suffer through
&gt; tribulation to get to GOD I would not boast of it to anyone. I would
&gt; be thankful he carried me through it just as I had FAITH he would.

&gt; &gt; It simply amazes me that people will fight for the right to tribulate when
&gt; &gt; Jesus already paid the price on the cross to extend the promise of escape.
&gt; &gt; Can't you understand that Jesus loves you and made a way for you? Or is it
&gt; &gt; that you doubt God is able to?

&gt; I do not see where I am fighting to go through tribulation. It's the
&gt; LAST

Kinnith--
If I may jump in here, just a few thoughts...

Some interesting types in the scripture--

Enoch--translated before the Flood--Enoch is known as a type of the
Church--he did not go through the flood

Noah--he and his family went through the Flood--Noah is a type of Israel;
the Flood is a type of the tribulation

Daniel and the 3 Hebrew Children
Where was Daniel when the 3 Hebrew children were cast into the fiery
furnace?  The scripture doesn't say specifically, but Daniel must have been
away at the time, because he wasn't subjected to the fiery furnace and he
certainly would have not prayed to the King's idol

Daniel--a type of the church;
The 3 Hebrew children--a type of Israel
Fiery furnace--a type of the tribulation

The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
Lot had to be removed before the angels could destroy the cities--

Daniel's 70 weeks vision
The entire vision was a prophecy of God's dealing with Israel--the 69 weeks,
until the coming of the Messiah--then the 70th week, for some reason set
apart from the rest of the 69--we have had a 2000 yr apostrophe between week
69 and week 70--do you agree that week 70 is the tribulation--do you agree
that the 70 weeks are talking about Israel? Would you agree that the church
is not mentioned in Revelation (on earth) after chapter 4:5--

The Jewish Wedding
. The Ketubah, Betrothal: Payment of the purchase price; set apart
(sanctified);
. Bridegroom departs to Father's House; Prepares room addition;
Bride prepares for his imminent return
. Surprise gathering; Huppah, Wedding
. Seven day Marriage supper

Pattern is Prologue: The Wedding Model
All through the Gospels, Jesus relies on the ancient
Jewish wedding pattern for many of His
parables, climaxing in His promise in the Upper
Room in John 14. Many of us miss the full import
of these allusions if we aren't familiar with the
model of the ancient Jewish wedding practices.

Jewish Wedding
The first step, the ketubah, or betrothal, was the
establishment of the marriage covenant, usually
when the prospective bridegroom took the initiative,
negotiating the price (mohair) he must pay
to purchase her.
Once the bridegroom paid the purchase price, the
marriage covenant was established, and the young
man and woman were regarded as husband and
wife. From that moment on, the bride was declared
to be consecrated or sanctified-set apart-
exclusively for her bridegroom. As a symbol of
the covenant relationship that had been established,
the groom and bride drank from a cup of wine
over which the betrothal had been pronounced.
After the marriage covenant was established, the
groom left his bride at her home and returned to
his father's house, where he remained separated
from his bride for approximately 12 months. This
afforded the bride time to gather her trousseau
and prepare for married life. During this period
of separation, the groom prepared a dwelling place
in his father's house, to which he would later bring
his bride.
At the end of the period of separation, the bridegroom
came-usually at night-to take his bride to
live with him. The groom, the best man, and other
male escorts left the father's house and conducted
a torch-light procession to the home of the bride.
Although the bride was expecting her groom to
come for her, she did not know the time of his
coming. As a result, the groom's arrival was preceded
by a shout, which announced her imminent
departure to be gathered with him.
After the groom received his bride, together with
her female attendants, the enlarged wedding party
returned from the bride's home to the groom's
father's house, where the wedding guests had assembled.
Shortly after their arrival, the bride and groom
were escorted by the other members of the wedding
party to the bridal chamber (huppah). Prior
to entering the chamber, the bride remained veiled
so that no one could see her face. While the
groomsmen and bridesmaids waited outside, the
bride and groom entered the bridal chamber alone.
There, in the privacy of that place, they entered
into physical union for the first time, thereby consummating
the marriage that had been covenanted
approximately one year earlier.
After the marriage was consummated, the groom
came out of the bridal chamber and announced
the consummation of the marriage to the members
of the wedding party waiting outside. Then,
as the groom went back to his bride in the chamber,
the members of the wedding party returned
to the wedding guests and announced the consummation
of the marriage. Upon receiving the good
news, the wedding guests remained in the groom's
father's house for the next seven days, celebrating
with a great wedding feast.
During the seven days of the wedding feast, the
bride and groom remained hidden in the bridal
chamber (Cf. Gen 29:21-23, 27-28) for the seven
days of the huppah. Afterwards, the groom came
out of hiding, bringing his bride with him, but with
her veil removed, so that everyone could see her.
The Ultimate Bride
New Testament portrays the Church as the Bride
of Christ: Eph 5:22-33. (Paul even quotes Gen 2:24
as the union at the parousia of the Bridegroom in
v.31! Cf. Romans 7:4; 2 Cor 11:2; James 4:4). In
the opening verses of John 14, the marriage covenant
is confirmed. Paul continually reminds us
of the purchase price, and the covenant by which
we, the Bride, are set apart-sanctified.

Ecclesiology vs. Eschatology
It is this distinctive nature of the Church that is
often overlooked by students of prophecy: it is more
a matter of ecclesiology than eschatology. One
thing which seems to highlight this distinctiveness
is the strange remark that Jesus made regarding
John the Baptist:

Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born
of women there hath not risen a greater than
John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is
least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew 11:11

What does that mean? Jesus goes on to explain,

For all the prophets and the law prophesied until
John.
Matthew 11:13

It is John the Baptist that closes the Old Testament,
not Malachi. A profound distinction appears
to be drawn between the saints of the Old Testament
and those of the New. One of the challenges
in fully appreciating Paul's epistles is the need to
understand the staggering distinctive advantages
afforded the Church, in contrast to those of the
Old Testament. And it is this role as the Bride of
the Bridegroom that is emphasized in the parables
and in the Book of Revelation.

The Departure of the Bridegroom
The Bridegroom has departed, and His return to
gather His Bride is imminent. He has gone to
prepare a place for you and me! (and He has been
at it for 2,000 years! It must be a spectacular
abode!) This very doctrine of &quot;imminence&quot; is taught
throughout the New Testament and is a cornerstone
of the &quot;pretribulational&quot; view: there is no
event which is a prerequisite condition for His gathering
of His Bride.
What Bridegroom would ever require His bride to go through a
Tribulation period (as described in Revelation) before
gathering her to himself and taking her to the wedding feast??

The Great Tribulation
There are those who believe the Church will go
through the Great Tribulation. In exploring this issue,
it is essential to distinguish between persecution,
which clearly has been the lot of the Church for
19 centuries, and &quot;the Great Tribulation&quot; of
eschatological significance. The persecution-and
tribulation-of the Church was clearly promised to
us:

These things I have spoken unto you, that in me
ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome
the world.
John 16:33

The source of this tribulation is the world and, of
course, Satan. However, &quot;the Great Tribulation&quot; of
eschatological significance is quite another matter.

For then shall be great tribulation, such as was
not since the beginning of the world to this time,
no, nor ever shall be.
Matthew 24:21

The context here is clearly Israel. Jesus is quoting
from the Old Testament:

And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great
prince which standeth for the children of thy
people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such
as never was since there was a nation even to that
same time: and at that time thy people shall be
delivered, every one that shall be found written
in the book.
Daniel 12:1

Note that &quot;thy people will be delivered:&quot; The focus
of the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; is Israel. That is why it
is called &quot;the time of Jacob's Trouble&quot;:

Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it:
it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall
be saved out of it.
Jeremiah 30:7

Jesus (in the Old Testament) explains:

I will go and return to my place, till they
acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in
their affliction they will seek me earnestly.
Hosea 5:15

To &quot;return,&quot; He must have left His place! The offence
referred to is singular and specific: their rejection
of Him. In &quot;their affliction&quot; they will
ultimately repent and He will respond.
The Great Tribulation also involves more than the
wrath of the world or the wrath of Satan: it involves
the indignation and wrath of God.
In contrast, the church has been promised:

For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to
obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians 5:9

And,

Much more then, being now justified by his blood,
we shall be saved from wrath through him.
Romans 5:9

And, specifically,

Because thou hast kept the word of my patience,
I also will keep thee from the hour [time] of
temptation [trial], which shall come upon all the
world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Revelation 3:10

Peter also emphasizes,

The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out
of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the
day of judgment to be punished:
2 Peter 2:9

Here Peter is using the judgment upon Sodom and
Gomorrah &quot;as an example,&quot; as Jesus also did, in
which the prior removal of Lot was a precondition
before the angels could do their work.

Dear Dan, very nice archetypes, all from the Old Testament...please look carefully at the New Testament, specifically the letters to the seven churches: why were they not raptured?
Simply put: the Lord wiped them out.
They were warned, did not bother to read and heed, (similar to my letters.) Is anyone out there humble enough to reply to the Lord in prayer?

But John's letters carry a blessing: if you would read Revelation, you will be blessed. You will also be blessed if you will humbly go to the Lord about why I insist that there will be no rapture, as there was no rapture for the seven churches: a disobedient and proud people of God are not overcomers.

&quot;A house divided against itself shall not stand&quot;. (New Testament: words of Jesus)

Only one body of Christ, with the exchanged life as found in Galatians 2:20, will have the strength to overcome the world. Only overcomers, only OVERCOMERS shall be raptured. (whether or not they know and understand the doctrine of the meeting in the air)

Please go to the Lord: He is only interested in one thing: His house, His body, His church, His bride. She must be glorious, the body must be pure and undefiled, sound, whole and not fractured in any way. His house must be clean, bright, and large enough for a Prince. His church must attack the gates of hell. This is what it means to be one body.

Of Christ, the Anointed One.

&gt; What Bridegroom would ever require His bride to go through a

Such a God could not be the Father that Jesus descibed to us and modeled.

Never once did Jesus reply to someone, who had asked Him for healing, that
they needed to suffer through it. Never did He give a stone to someone who
asked for bread. Never did He refuse someone for being to sinful to heal. He
simply healed them all (with the exception of those who didn't have faith,
Post-Tribbers take note; faith is required, works are not).

God is able to perform all that He has promised.

God Bless your walk of faith with the Lord.

&gt; Kinnith--
&gt; If I may jump in here, just a few thoughts...

&gt; Some interesting types in the scripture--

&gt; Enoch--translated before the Flood--Enoch is known as a type of the
&gt; Church--he did not go through the flood

&gt; Noah--he and his family went through the Flood--Noah is a type of Israel;
&gt; the Flood is a type of the tribulation

&gt; Daniel and the 3 Hebrew Children
&gt; Where was Daniel when the 3 Hebrew children were cast into the fiery
&gt; furnace?  The scripture doesn't say specifically, but Daniel must have
&gt; been
&gt; away at the time, because he wasn't subjected to the fiery furnace and he
&gt; certainly would have not prayed to the King's idol

&gt; Daniel--a type of the church;
&gt; The 3 Hebrew children--a type of Israel
&gt; Fiery furnace--a type of the tribulation

&gt; The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
&gt; Lot had to be removed before the angels could destroy the cities--

&gt; Daniel's 70 weeks vision
&gt; The entire vision was a prophecy of God's dealing with Israel--the 69
&gt; weeks,
&gt; until the coming of the Messiah--then the 70th week, for some reason set
&gt; apart from the rest of the 69--we have had a 2000 yr apostrophe between
&gt; week
&gt; 69 and week 70--do you agree that week 70 is the tribulation--do you agree
&gt; that the 70 weeks are talking about Israel? Would you agree that the
&gt; church
&gt; is not mentioned in Revelation (on earth) after chapter 4:5--

&gt; The Jewish Wedding
&gt; . The Ketubah, Betrothal: Payment of the purchase price; set apart
&gt; (sanctified);
&gt; . Bridegroom departs to Father's House; Prepares room addition;
&gt;  Bride prepares for his imminent return
&gt; . Surprise gathering; Huppah, Wedding
&gt; . Seven day Marriage supper

&gt; Pattern is Prologue: The Wedding Model
&gt; All through the Gospels, Jesus relies on the ancient
&gt; Jewish wedding pattern for many of His
&gt; parables, climaxing in His promise in the Upper
&gt; Room in John 14. Many of us miss the full import
&gt; of these allusions if we aren't familiar with the
&gt; model of the ancient Jewish wedding practices.

&gt; Jewish Wedding
&gt; The first step, the ketubah, or betrothal, was the
&gt; establishment of the marriage covenant, usually
&gt; when the prospective bridegroom took the initiative,
&gt; negotiating the price (mohair) he must pay
&gt; to purchase her.
&gt; Once the bridegroom paid the purchase price, the
&gt; marriage covenant was established, and the young
&gt; man and woman were regarded as husband and
&gt; wife. From that moment on, the bride was declared
&gt; to be consecrated or sanctified-set apart-
&gt; exclusively for her bridegroom. As a symbol of
&gt; the covenant relationship that had been established,
&gt; the groom and bride drank from a cup of wine
&gt; over which the betrothal had been pronounced.
&gt; After the marriage covenant was established, the
&gt; groom left his bride at her home and returned to
&gt; his father's house, where he remained separated
&gt; from his bride for approximately 12 months. This
&gt; afforded the bride time to gather her trousseau
&gt; and prepare for married life. During this period
&gt; of separation, the groom prepared a dwelling place
&gt; in his father's house, to which he would later bring
&gt; his bride.
&gt; At the end of the period of separation, the bridegroom
&gt; came-usually at night-to take his bride to
&gt; live with him. The groom, the best man, and other
&gt; male escorts left the father's house and conducted
&gt; a torch-light procession to the home of the bride.
&gt; Although the bride was expecting her groom to
&gt; come for her, she did not know the time of his
&gt; coming. As a result, the groom's arrival was preceded
&gt; by a shout, which announced her imminent
&gt; departure to be gathered with him.
&gt; After the groom received his bride, together with
&gt; her female attendants, the enlarged wedding party
&gt; returned from the bride's home to the groom's
&gt; father's house, where the wedding guests had assembled.
&gt; Shortly after their arrival, the bride and groom
&gt; were escorted by the other members of the wedding
&gt; party to the bridal chamber (huppah). Prior
&gt; to entering the chamber, the bride remained veiled
&gt; so that no one could see her face. While the
&gt; groomsmen and bridesmaids waited outside, the
&gt; bride and groom entered the bridal chamber alone.
&gt; There, in the privacy of that place, they entered
&gt; into physical union for the first time, thereby consummating
&gt; the marriage that had been covenanted
&gt; approximately one year earlier.
&gt; After the marriage was consummated, the groom
&gt; came out of the bridal chamber and announced
&gt; the consummation of the marriage to the members
&gt; of the wedding party waiting outside. Then,
&gt; as the groom went back to his bride in the chamber,
&gt; the members of the wedding party returned
&gt; to the wedding guests and announced the consummation
&gt; of the marriage. Upon receiving the good
&gt; news, the wedding guests remained in the groom's
&gt; father's house for the next seven days, celebrating
&gt; with a great wedding feast.
&gt; During the seven days of the wedding feast, the
&gt; bride and groom remained hidden in the bridal
&gt; chamber (Cf. Gen 29:21-23, 27-28) for the seven
&gt; days of the huppah. Afterwards, the groom came
&gt; out of hiding, bringing his bride with him, but with
&gt; her veil removed, so that everyone could see her.
&gt; The Ultimate Bride
&gt; New Testament portrays the Church as the Bride
&gt; of Christ: Eph 5:22-33. (Paul even quotes Gen 2:24
&gt; as the union at the parousia of the Bridegroom in
&gt; v.31! Cf. Romans 7:4; 2 Cor 11:2; James 4:4). In
&gt; the opening verses of John 14, the marriage covenant
&gt; is confirmed. Paul continually reminds us
&gt; of the purchase price, and the covenant by which
&gt; we, the Bride, are set apart-sanctified.

&gt; Ecclesiology vs. Eschatology
&gt; It is this distinctive nature of the Church that is
&gt; often overlooked by students of prophecy: it is more
&gt; a matter of ecclesiology than eschatology. One
&gt; thing which seems to highlight this distinctiveness
&gt; is the strange remark that Jesus made regarding
&gt; John the Baptist:

&gt; Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born
&gt; of women there hath not risen a greater than
&gt; John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is
&gt; least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
&gt; Matthew 11:11

&gt; What does that mean? Jesus goes on to explain,

&gt; For all the prophets and the law prophesied until
&gt; John.
&gt; Matthew 11:13

&gt; It is John the Baptist that closes the Old Testament,
&gt; not Malachi. A profound distinction appears
&gt; to be drawn between the saints of the Old Testament
&gt; and those of the New. One of the challenges
&gt; in fully appreciating Paul's epistles is the need to
&gt; understand the staggering distinctive advantages
&gt; afforded the Church, in contrast to those of the
&gt; Old Testament. And it is this role as the Bride of
&gt; the Bridegroom that is emphasized in the parables
&gt; and in the Book of Revelation.

&gt; The Departure of the Bridegroom
&gt; The Bridegroom has departed, and His return to
&gt; gather His Bride is imminent. He has gone to
&gt; prepare a place for you and me! (and He has been
&gt; at it for 2,000 years! It must be a spectacular
&gt; abode!) This very doctrine of &quot;imminence&quot; is taught
&gt; throughout the New Testament and is a cornerstone
&gt; of the &quot;pretribulational&quot; view: there is no
&gt; event which is a prerequisite condition for His gathering
&gt; of His Bride.
&gt; What Bridegroom would ever require His bride to go through a
&gt; Tribulation period (as described in Revelation) before
&gt; gathering her to himself and taking her to the wedding feast??

&gt; The Great Tribulation
&gt; There are those who believe the Church will go
&gt; through the Great Tribulation. In exploring this issue,
&gt; it is essential to distinguish between persecution,
&gt; which clearly has been the lot of the Church for
&gt; 19 centuries, and &quot;the Great Tribulation&quot; of
&gt; eschatological significance. The persecution-and
&gt; tribulation-of the Church was clearly promised to
&gt; us:

&gt; These things I have spoken unto you, that in me
&gt; ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
&gt; tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome
&gt; the world.
&gt; John 16:33

&gt; The source of this tribulation is the world and, of
&gt; course, Satan. However, &quot;the Great Tribulation&quot; of
&gt; eschatological significance is quite another matter.

&gt; For then shall be great tribulation, such as was
&gt; not since the beginning of the world to this time,
&gt; no, nor ever shall be.
&gt; Matthew 24:21

&gt; The context here is clearly Israel. Jesus is quoting
&gt; from the Old Testament:

&gt; And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great
&gt; prince which standeth for the children of thy
&gt; people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such
&gt; as never was since there was a nation even to that
&gt; same time: and at that time thy people shall be
&gt; delivered, every one that shall be found written
&gt; in the book.
&gt; Daniel 12:1

&gt; Note that &quot;thy people will be delivered:&quot; The focus
&gt; of the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; is Israel. That is why it
&gt; is called &quot;the time of Jacob's Trouble&quot;:

&gt; Alas! for that

No, no you are completely wrong in that statement. The world will not go
through the tribulation because the world follows Satan and it is HE
that causes tribulation against the saints. Why? simple. Because he
HATES us because of what God has done for us. &quot;THE WRATH OF THE LAMB&quot; is
against the world. The TRIBULATION is against the saints. If you think
that these TWO things are the same, well you're as blind (maybe
willfully with pride) as a bat. Please do yourself this favor... Look up
the word &quot;tribulation&quot; in your concordance. You will find out the EVERY
SINGLE INSTANCE it is used, it is referring  to what the SAINTS go
through. Not the world.

&gt;     you agree
&gt;     &gt; that the 70 weeks are talking about Israel? Would you agree that the
&gt;     &gt; church
&gt;     &gt; is not mentioned in Revelation (on earth) after chapter 4:5--

&gt;     &gt; The Jewish Wedding
&gt;     &gt; . The Ketubah, Betrothal: Payment of the purchase price; set apart
&gt;     &gt; (sanctified);
&gt;     &gt; . Bridegroom departs to Father's House; Prepares room addition;
&gt;     &gt;  Bride prepares for his imminent return
&gt;     &gt; . Surprise gathering; Huppah, Wedding
&gt;     &gt; . Seven day Marriage supper

&gt;     &gt; Pattern is Prologue: The Wedding Model
&gt;     &gt; All through the Gospels, Jesus relies on the ancient
&gt;     &gt; Jewish wedding pattern for many of His
&gt;     &gt; parables, climaxing in His promise in the Upper
&gt;     &gt; Room in John 14. Many of us miss the full import
&gt;     &gt; of these allusions if we aren't familiar with the
&gt;     &gt; model of the ancient Jewish wedding practices.

&gt;     &gt; Jewish Wedding
&gt;     &gt; The first step, the ketubah, or betrothal, was the
&gt;     &gt; establishment of the marriage covenant, usually
&gt;     &gt; when the prospective bridegroom took the initiative,
&gt;     &gt; negotiating the price (mohair) he must pay
&gt;     &gt; to purchase her.
&gt;     &gt; Once the bridegroom paid the purchase price, the
&gt;     &gt; marriage covenant was established, and the young
&gt;     &gt; man and woman were regarded as husband and
&gt;     &gt; wife. From that moment on, the bride was declared
&gt;     &gt; to be consecrated or sanctified-set apart-
&gt;     &gt; exclusively for her bridegroom. As a symbol of
&gt;     &gt; the covenant relationship that had been established,
&gt;     &gt; the groom and bride drank from a cup of wine
&gt;     &gt; over which the betrothal had been pronounced.
&gt;     &gt; After the marriage covenant was established, the
&gt;     &gt; groom left his bride at her home and returned to
&gt;     &gt; his father's house, where he remained separated
&gt;     &gt; from his bride for approximately 12 months. This
&gt;     &gt; afforded the bride time to gather her trousseau
&gt;     &gt; and prepare for married life. During this period
&gt;     &gt; of separation, the groom prepared a dwelling place
&gt;     &gt; in his father's house, to which he would later bring
&gt;     &gt; his bride.
&gt;     &gt; At the end of the period of separation, the bridegroom
&gt;     &gt; came-usually at night-to take his bride to
&gt;     &gt; live with him. The groom, the best man, and other
&gt;     &gt; male escorts left the father's house and conducted
&gt;     &gt; a torch-light procession to the home of the bride.
&gt;     &gt; Although the bride was expecting her groom to
&gt;     &gt; come for her, she did not know the time of his
&gt;     &gt; coming. As a result, the groom's arrival was preceded
&gt;     &gt; by a shout, which announced her imminent
&gt;     &gt; departure to be gathered with him.
&gt;     &gt; After the groom received his bride, together with
&gt;     &gt; her female attendants, the enlarged wedding party
&gt;     &gt; returned from the bride's home to the groom's
&gt;     &gt; father's house, where the wedding guests had assembled.
&gt;     &gt; Shortly after their arrival, the bride and groom
&gt;     &gt; were escorted by the other members of the wedding
&gt;     &gt; party to the bridal chamber (huppah). Prior
&gt;     &gt; to entering the chamber, the bride remained veiled
&gt;     &gt; so that no one could see her face. While the
&gt;     &gt; groomsmen and bridesmaids waited outside, the
&gt;     &gt; bride and groom entered the bridal chamber alone.
&gt;     &gt; There, in the privacy of that place, they entered
&gt;     &gt; into physical union for the first time, thereby consummating
&gt;     &gt; the marriage that had been covenanted
&gt;     &gt; approximately one year earlier.
&gt;     &gt; After the marriage was consummated, the groom
&gt;     &gt; came out of the bridal chamber and announced
&gt;     &gt; the consummation of the marriage to the members
&gt;     &gt; of the wedding party waiting outside. Then,
&gt;     &gt; as the groom went back to his bride in the chamber,
&gt;     &gt; the members of the wedding party returned
&gt;     &gt; to the wedding guests and announced the consummation
&gt;     &gt; of the marriage. Upon receiving the good
&gt;     &gt; news, the wedding guests remained in the groom's
&gt;     &gt; father's house for the next seven days, celebrating
&gt;     &gt; with a great wedding feast.
&gt;     &gt; During the seven days of the wedding feast, the
&gt;     &gt; bride and groom remained hidden in the bridal
&gt;     &gt; chamber (Cf. Gen 29:21-23, 27-28) for the seven
&gt;     &gt; days of the huppah. Afterwards, the groom came
&gt;     &gt; out of hiding, bringing his bride with him, but with
&gt;     &gt; her veil removed, so that everyone could see her.
&gt;     &gt; The Ultimate Bride
&gt;     &gt; New Testament portrays the Church as the Bride
&gt;     &gt; of Christ: Eph 5:22-33. (Paul even quotes Gen 2:24
&gt;     &gt; as the union at the parousia of the Bridegroom in
&gt;     &gt; v.31! Cf. Romans 7:4; 2 Cor 11:2; James 4:4). In
&gt;     &gt; the opening verses of John 14, the marriage covenant
&gt;     &gt; is confirmed. Paul continually reminds us
&gt;     &gt; of the purchase price, and the covenant by which
&gt;     &gt; we, the Bride, are set apart-sanctified.

&gt;     &gt; Ecclesiology vs. Eschatology
&gt;     &gt; It is this distinctive nature of the Church that is
&gt;     &gt; often overlooked by students of prophecy: it is more
&gt;     &gt; a matter of ecclesiology than eschatology. One
&gt;     &gt; thing which seems to highlight this distinctiveness
&gt;     &gt; is the strange remark that Jesus made regarding
&gt;     &gt; John the Baptist:

&gt;     &gt; Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born
&gt;     &gt; of women there hath not risen a greater than
&gt;     &gt; John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is
&gt;     &gt; least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
&gt;     &gt; Matthew 11:11

&gt;     &gt; What does that mean? Jesus goes on to explain,

&gt;     &gt; For all the prophets and the law prophesied until
&gt;     &gt; John.
&gt;     &gt; Matthew 11:13

&gt;     &gt; It is John the Baptist that closes the Old Testament,
&gt;     &gt; not Malachi. A profound distinction appears
&gt;     &gt; to be drawn between the saints of the Old Testament
&gt;     &gt; and those of the New. One of the challenges
&gt;     &gt; in fully appreciating Paul's epistles is the need to
&gt;     &gt; understand the staggering distinctive advantages
&gt;     &gt; afforded

Joanna and others who believe that the by virtue of the fact that anyone is a believer will be spared wrath, I would ask: Why were the Ephesians not spared the Wrath of God? He warned that he would come as a theif in the night to them. He did. Archeologists have found that city and others nearby buried in tonnes of rubble from earthquakes and volcanic eruption.

Why did God not rapture them? Simply put: God wiped them away. Why? Because they did not bother to read the warnings given to them by the apostles and then by Jesus Himself in the letter delivered to them by an angel. So, the letters survived, but the believers did not.

Earthquake and volcanic fire and brimstone was reserved for them becuase they did not repent and return to their first love. We can learn from this: believers suffer wrath because God is holy. Believe on the Lord and thou SHALL be saved. (Shall is a subjunctive word meaning it can or may not happen, depending on the obedience of the believer).

If a believer 'believes' but does not follow through with total obedience (according to Galatians 2:2) they are not saved at all. they are allotted the 'portion with the unbelievers'. Jesus words in Revelation. You too, shall be blessed for reading these words.

&quot;Study to show thyself approved&quot; was Paul's admontion to Timothy. It is a good thing for all of us. amen.

For anyone wanting to know more about the rise and fall of Ephesus, please write back. God wants to show you many things: as in Jeremiah 33:3

No, no you are completely wrong in that statement. The world will not go
through the tribulation because the world follows Satan and it is HE
that causes tribulation against the saints. Why? simple. Because he
HATES us because of what God has done for us. &quot;THE WRATH OF THE LAMB&quot; is
against the world. The TRIBULATION is against the saints. If you think
that these TWO things are the same, well you're as blind (maybe
willfully with pride) as a bat. Please do yourself this favor... Look up
the word &quot;tribulation&quot; in your concordance. You will find out the EVERY

&gt; Never once did Jesus reply to someone, who had asked Him for

Okay.....

1.   IF they were believers, then the wrath didn't come from GOD but
from the ENEMY. CORRECTION comes from GOD. CONDEMNATION from GOD is poured
out on *UN*BELIEVERS.
2. It doesn't make any sense that the anti-christ would be pouring out
wrath on those who believe in him...at least during the trib. He
wants people to believe to believe He is GOD.    The ANTI-CHRIST will be
pouring his wrath on those who *refuse* to take the mark of loyalty.
Tribulation saints...Jewish and gentile believers, who become believers when
they realize that the RAPTURE had occurred....these will be targets of the
anti-Christ. IN the meantime,  You must remember that many of the
'judgments' the world will see during that time are somewhat repeats of what
happened during the days of Egypt.

The people living on the earth during the great tribulation will be
forced to choose sides...The things that will happen are God's LAST DITCH
EFFORT to get people's attention. IF it was the enemy doing all of it, then
he'd just obliterate the lot of 'em. Especially after they took the mark.
But it's GOD who wants to get the attention of those who have yet to
decide.

*If you believe* that GOD pours WRATH on BELIEVERS...then you need
some more study time.  He *corrects*  believers.  The wrath of God will be
poured out on those who WON'T believe, and those same plagues (Seal,
trumpet, Bowl JUDGMENTS)  will hopefully provoke those who are undecided to
realize &quot;IF THIS IS A PREVIEW OF COMMING ATTRACTIONS *{HELL}*  I don't want
to see the whole show.&quot;

That's my peace.

No one will know for SURE WHAT happens but we do know who's in control!.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The 3 Hebrew children--a type of Israel
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fiery furnace--a type of the tribulation

&gt; &gt; &gt; The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lot had to be removed before the angels could destroy the cities--

&gt; &gt; &gt; Daniel's 70 weeks vision
&gt; &gt; &gt; The entire vision was a prophecy of God's dealing with
&gt; &gt; Israel--the 69
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; until the coming of the Messiah--then the 70th week, for some
&gt; &gt; reason set
&gt; &gt; &gt; apart from the rest of the 69--we have had a 2000 yr apostrophe
&gt; &gt; between
&gt; &gt; &gt; week
&gt; &gt; &gt; 69 and week 70--do you agree that week 70 is the tribulation--do
&gt; &gt; you agree
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the 70 weeks are talking about Israel? Would you agree that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; church
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not mentioned in Revelation (on earth) after chapter 4:5--

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Jewish Wedding
&gt; &gt; &gt; . The Ketubah, Betrothal: Payment of the purchase price; set apart
&gt; &gt; &gt; (sanctified);
&gt; &gt; &gt; . Bridegroom departs to Father's House; Prepares room addition;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bride prepares for his imminent return
&gt; &gt; &gt; . Surprise gathering; Huppah, Wedding
&gt; &gt; &gt; . Seven day Marriage supper

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pattern is Prologue: The Wedding Model
&gt; &gt; &gt; All through the Gospels, Jesus relies on the ancient
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish wedding pattern for many of His
&gt; &gt; &gt; parables, climaxing in His promise in the Upper
&gt; &gt; &gt; Room in John 14. Many of us miss the full import
&gt; &gt; &gt; of these allusions if we aren't familiar with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; model of the ancient Jewish wedding practices.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jewish Wedding
&gt; &gt; &gt; The first step, the ketubah, or betrothal, was the
&gt; &gt; &gt; establishment of the marriage covenant, usually
&gt; &gt; &gt; when the prospective bridegroom took the initiative,
&gt; &gt; &gt; negotiating the price (mohair) he must pay
&gt; &gt; &gt; to purchase her.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Once the bridegroom paid the purchase price, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; marriage covenant was established, and the young
&gt; &gt; &gt; man and woman were regarded as husband and
&gt; &gt; &gt; wife. From that moment on, the bride was declared
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be consecrated or sanctified-set apart-
&gt; &gt; &gt; exclusively for her bridegroom. As a symbol of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the covenant relationship that had been established,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the groom and bride drank from a cup of wine
&gt; &gt; &gt; over which the betrothal had been pronounced.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After the marriage covenant was established, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; groom left his bride at her home and returned to
&gt; &gt; &gt; his father's house, where he remained separated
&gt; &gt; &gt; from his bride for approximately 12 months. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; afforded the bride time to gather her trousseau
&gt; &gt; &gt; and prepare for married life. During this period
&gt; &gt; &gt; of separation, the groom prepared a dwelling place
&gt; &gt; &gt; in his father's house, to which he would later bring
&gt; &gt; &gt; his bride.
&gt; &gt; &gt; At the end of the period of separation, the bridegroom
&gt; &gt; &gt; came-usually at night-to take his bride to
&gt; &gt; &gt; live with him. The groom, the best man, and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; male escorts left the father's house and conducted
&gt; &gt; &gt; a torch-light procession to the home of the bride.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although the bride was expecting her groom to
&gt; &gt; &gt; come for her, she did not know the time of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; coming. As a result, the groom's arrival was preceded
&gt; &gt; &gt; by a shout, which announced her imminent
&gt; &gt; &gt; departure to be gathered with him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After the groom received his bride, together with
&gt; &gt; &gt; her female attendants, the enlarged wedding party
&gt; &gt; &gt; returned from the bride's home to the groom's
&gt; &gt; &gt; father's house, where the wedding guests had assembled.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shortly after their arrival, the bride and groom
&gt; &gt; &gt; were escorted by the other members of the wedding
&gt; &gt; &gt; party to the bridal chamber (huppah). Prior
&gt; &gt; &gt; to entering the chamber, the bride

The Cashless Society Has Arrived
By

Robert Samuelson

It's one of those vast social upheavals that everyone understands
but that hardly anyone notices, because it seems too ordinary: the
long-predicted &quot;cashless society&quot; has quietly arrived, or nearly so;
currency, coins and checks are receding as ways of doing everyday
business; we've become Plastic Nation. In the tangled history of
American money--from tobacco receipts to gold and silver coins to paper
money and checks--this is a seismic shift. Time to pay attention.

If you visit the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (one
operation in Washington, the other in Ft. Worth, Texas), you can still
see greenbacks being made. They come off the presses in sheets of 32.
In fiscal 2007, the government will print about 9.1 billion individual
bills. But 95 percent is to replace worn currency, not to expand the
supply. THE BUCK STARTS HERE, say signs on some printing presses. In
reality, today's buck usually begins (and ends) as a mere data entry.

You can use a card almost anywhere. From 1999 to 2005, the number of
card-swiping terminals nearly tripled to 6.8 million, says the
consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. Habits and mind-sets change. In
1990, most Americans regarded paying for groceries by credit card as
unnatural. Now cards cover about 65 percent of food sales, says the
Food Marketing Institute. There's electronic banking (83 percent of
Social Security beneficiaries receive their monthly payments by
automatic deposit), Internet buying, prepaid cards and automatic
identity tags for toll booths.

Our information on actual cash use is skimpy, and some
enclaves--especially among the poor--endure; about 9 percent of
families don't have bank accounts. Still, the evidence all points in
the same direction:

* U.S. currency (dollar bills of all amounts) totaled $784 billion
in 2006, but probably half or more is held outside the United States by
foreigners who prize dollars--especially $100 bills--as a store of
value. That suggests that less than $400 billion in currency supports a
$13 trillion economy. In 1970, the economy's relative need for cash was
almost twice as high.

* In 2005, Americans held 1.7 billion credit and debit cards (about
seven for everyone over 15), says The Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter, and in the past decade, debit-card use has soared. In 1996,
checks and cash represented almost 80 percent of consumer payments,
estimates Nilson; they're now less than half. (The latest firm figures
for 2005 show all paper payments at 50.3 percent of the total, with
cash at 20.7 percent; by 2010, Nilson expects electronic payments to
exceed 70 percent of the total.)

* From a peak of almost 50 billion in 1995, the number of checks
written in the United States fell to 36.6 billion in 2003, while the
number of electronic payments rose from 15 billion to 44 billion,
estimates the Federal Reserve. (The Fed survey doesn't directly measure
cash use.)

In some ways, this placid transformation is astonishing.
Historically, the nature of money has been an explosive issue.
Inflationary experiences with paper money during and after the
Revolution led the Constitutional Convention to give the national
government a monopoly of coining money (gold and silver coin) and to
bar states from printing paper money, says Farley Grubb, an economic
historian at the University of Delaware.

Despite that, state-chartered banks (not states) issued much paper
money in the early 19th century. The national government got into the
act in the Civil War with &quot;greenbacks.&quot; Debates raged over what money
should be and how much it should be backed by gold or silver. Debtors
and creditors disagreed. People wanted money scarce enough to be
trustworthy (that is, no inflation). But they wanted it abundant enough
to lubricate commerce and prevent falling prices (that is, no
deflation).

The comparatively tranquil triumph of electronic money reflects its
origins in technology, not politics. In many ways, it's cheaper than
cash or checks. The Fed says that processing an electronic payment
costs a fifth as much as a check. It's more convenient; people don't
need to run so often to the bank or ATM machines for cash. To be sure,
controversies remain. Consumers recoil at some monthly fees and high
interest rates. Supermarkets and other stores contend that Visa and
MasterCard, dominating the card industry, impose excessive fees on
retailers. The fees then finance wasteful marketing campaigns (6
billion solicitations in 2005) and &quot;rewards&quot; (airline miles, cash
back). Store prices for everyone get nudged up to benefit the most
upscale cardholders, who qualify for the most generous rewards. The
card companies say they're merely balancing &quot;incentives&quot; for
cardholders and stores to use the cards.

Still, these feuds pale against the incendiary money wars of the
past, symbolized by William Jennings Bryan's campaign against the gold
standard in the election of 1896. We have crossed a cultural as well as
an economic threshold when plastic and money are synonyms and the crime
of choice is identity theft, not bank robbery.

Joanna and others who believe that the by virtue of the fact that anyone is a believer will be spared wrath, I would ask: Why were the Ephesians not spared the Wrath of God? He warned that he would come as a theif in the night to them. He did. Archeologists have found that city and others nearby buried in tonnes of rubble from earthquakes and volcanic eruption.     Why did God not rapture them? Simply put: God wiped them away. Why? Because they did not bother to read the warnings given to them by the apostles and then by Jesus Himself in the letter delivered to them by an angel. So, the letters survived, but the believers did not.     Earthquake and volcanic fire and brimstone was reserved for them becuase they did not repent and return to their first love. We can learn from this: believers suffer wrath because God is holy. Believe on the Lord and thou SHALL be saved. (Shall is a subjunctive word meaning it can or
may not happen, depending on the obedience of the believer).     If a believer 'believes' but does not follow through with total obedience (according to Galatians 2:2) they are not saved at all. they are allotted the 'portion with the unbelievers'. Jesus words in Revelation. You too, shall be blessed for reading these words.     &quot;Study to show thyself approved&quot; was Paul's admontion to Timothy. It is a good thing for all of us. amen.     For anyone wanting to know more about the rise and fall of Ephesus, please write back. God wants to show you many things: as in Jeremiah 33:3

No, no you are completely wrong in that statement. The world will not go
through the tribulation because the world follows Satan and it is HE
that causes tribulation against the saints. Why? simple. Because he
HATES us because of what God has done for us. &quot;THE WRATH OF THE LAMB&quot; is
against the world. The TRIBULATION is against the saints. If you think
that these TWO things are the same, well you're as blind (maybe
willfully with pride) as a bat. Please do yourself this favor... Look up
the word &quot;tribulation&quot; in your concordance. You will find out the EVERY
SINGLE INSTANCE it is used, it is referring to what the SAINTS go
through. Not the world.

&gt; Hi Dan,

&gt; Thanks a lot for
this post.

&gt; I had never heard of Daniel being a type of the church before, it
&gt; really
&gt; made my day.

&gt; &gt; of His Bride.
&gt; &gt; What Bridegroom would ever require His bride to go through a
&gt; &gt; Tribulation period (as described in Revelation) before
&gt; &gt; gathering her to himself and taking her to the wedding feast??

&gt; Such a God could not be the Father that Jesus descibed to us and
&gt; modeled.

&gt; Never once did Jesus reply to someone, who had asked Him for
&gt; healing, that
&gt; they needed to suffer through it. Never did He give a stone to
&gt; someone who
&gt; asked for bread. Never did He refuse someone for being to sinful
&gt; to heal. He
&gt; simply healed them all (with the exception of those who didn't
&gt; have faith,
&gt; Post-Tribbers take note; faith is required, works are not).

&gt; God is able to perform all that He
has promised.

&gt; God Bless your walk of faith with the Lord.
