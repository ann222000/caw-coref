Air Force refused to fly weapons (nukes) to Middle East theater
By Wayne Madsen
Sept. 24, 2007
Author's website

WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the
B-52 transporting six stealth AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each
armed with a W-80-1 nuclear warhead, on August 30, were destined for
the Middle East via Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

However, elements of the Air Force, supported by U.S. intelligence
agency personnel, successfully revealed the ultimate destination of
the nuclear weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal
opposition within the Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community.

Yesterday, the /Washington Post/ attempted to explain away the fact
that America's nuclear command and control system broke down in an
unprecedented manner by reporting that it was the result of &quot;security
failures at multiple levels.&quot; It is now apparent that the command and
control breakdown, reported as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary
of Defense and White House, was not the result of a command and
control chain-of-command &quot;failures&quot; but the result of a revolt and
push back by various echelons within the Air Force and intelligence
agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and
conventional
weapons.

The /Washington Post/ story on BENT SPEAR may have actually been an
effort in damage control by the Bush administration. WMR has been
informed by a knowledgeable source that one of the six nuclear-armed
cruise missiles was, and may still be, unaccounted for. In that case,
the nuclear reporting incident would have gone far beyond BENT SPEAR
to a National Command Authority alert known as EMPTY QUIVER, with the
special classification of PINNACLE.

Just as this report was being prepared, /Newsweek/ reported that Vice
President Dick Cheney's recently-departed Middle East adviser, David
Wurmser, told a small group of advisers some months ago that Cheney
had considered asking Israel to launch a missile attack on the Iranian
nuclear site at Natanz. Cheney reasoned that after an Iranian
retaliatory strike, the United States would have ample reasons to
launch its own massive attack on Iran. However, plans for Israel to
attack Iran directly were altered to an Israeli attack on a supposed
Syrian-Iranian-North Korean nuclear installation in northern Syria.

WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and
conventional weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel's September
6 air attack on a reputed Syrian nuclear facility in Dayr az-Zwar,
near the village of Tal Abyad, in northern Syria, near the Turkish
border. Israel's attack, code named OPERATION ORCHARD, was to provide
a reason for the U.S. to strike Iran. The neo-conservative propaganda
onslaught was to cite the cooperation of the George Bush's three
remaining &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; states -- Syria, Iran, and North Korea -- to
justify a sustained Israeli attack on Syria and a massive U.S.
military attack on Iran.

WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic
that there was a definite connection between Israel's OPERATION
ORCHARD and BENT SPEAR involving the B-52 that flew the six nuclear-
armed cruise missiles from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to
Barksdale. There is also a connection between these two events as the
Pentagon's highly-classified PROJECT CHECKMATE, a compartmented U.S.
Air Force program that has been working on an attack plan for Iran
since June 2007, around the same time that Cheney was working on the
joint Israeli-U.S. attack scenario on Iran.

PROJECT CHECKMATE was leaked in an article by military analyst Eric
Margolis in the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, the /Times of London/,
is a program that involves over two dozen Air Force officers and is
headed by Brig. Gen. Lawrence Stutzriem and his chief civilian
adviser, Dr. Lani Kass, a former Israeli military intelligence officer
who, astoundingly, is now involved in planning a joint U.S.-Israeli
massive military attack on Iran that involves a &quot;decapitating&quot; blow on
Iran by hitting between three to four thousand targets in the country.
Stutzriem and Kass report directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff,
General Michael Moseley, who has also been charged with preparing a
report on the B-52/nuclear weapons incident.

Kass' area of speciality is cyber-warfare, which includes ensuring
&quot;information blockades,&quot; such as that imposed by the Israeli
government on the Israeli media regarding the Syrian air attack on the
alleged Syrian &quot;nuclear installation.&quot; British intelligence sources
have reported that the Israeli attack on Syria was a &quot;true flag&quot;
attack originally designed to foreshadow a U.S. attack on Iran. After
the U.S. Air Force push back against transporting the six cruise
nuclear-armed AGM-129s to the Middle East, Israel went ahead with its
attack on Syria in order to help ratchet up tensions between
Washington on one side and Damascus, Tehran, and Pyongyang on the
other.

The other part of CHECKMATE's brief is to ensure that a media
&quot;perception management&quot; is waged against Syria, Iran, and North Korea.
This involves articles such as that which appeared with Joby Warrick's
and Walter Pincus' bylines in yesterdays /Washington Post/. The
article, titled &quot;The Saga of a Bent Spear,&quot; quotes a number of
seasoned Air Force nuclear weapons experts as saying that such an
incident is unprecedented in the history of the Air Force. For
example, Retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger, the former chief of
the U.S. Strategic Command, said he has been in the &quot;nuclear business&quot;
since 1966 and has never been aware of an incident &quot;more disturbing.&quot;

Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are
unprecedented, except for that fact that the U.S. military is now
waging an internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S.
government and military chain of command who are intent on using
nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive war with Iran.

CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD would have provided the cover for a
pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran had it not been for BENT
SPEAR involving the B-52. In on the plan to launch a pre-emptive
attack on Iran involving nuclear weapons were, according to our
sources, Cheney, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley; members of
the CHECKMATE team at the Pentagon, who have close connections to
Israeli intelligence and pro-Israeli think tanks in Washington,
including the Hudson Institute; British Foreign Secretary David
Miliband, a political adviser to Tony Blair prior to becoming a Member
of Parliament; Israeli political leaders like Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu; and French Foreign
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who did his part last week to ratchet up
tensions with Iran by suggesting that war with Iran was a probability.
Kouchner retracted his statement after the U.S. plans for Iran were
delayed.

Although the Air Force tried to keep the B-52 nuclear incident from
the media, anonymous Air Force personnel leaked the story to /Military
Times/ on September 5, the day before the Israelis attacked the
alleged nuclear installation in Syria and the day planned for the
simultaneous U.S. attack on Iran. The leaking of classified
information on U.S. nuclear weapons disposition or movement to the
media, is, itself, unprecedented. Air Force regulations require the
sending of classified BEELINE reports to higher Air Force authorities
on the disclosure of classified Air Force information to the media.

In another highly unusual move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has
asked an outside inquiry board to look into BENT SPEAR, even before
the Air Force has completed its own investigation, a virtual vote of
no confidence in the official investigation being conducted by Major
General Douglas Raaberg, chief of air and space operations at the Air
Combat Command.

Gates asked former Air Force Chief of Staff, retired General Larry
Welch, to lead a Defense Science Board task force that will also look
into the BENT SPEAR incident. The official Air Force investigation has
reportedly been delayed for unknown reasons. Welch is President and
CEO of the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA), a federally-funded
research contractor that operates three research centers, including
one for Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive
Office of the President and another for the National Security Agency.
One of the board members of IDA is Dr. Suzanne H. Woolsey of the
Paladin Capital Group and wife of former CIA director and arch-neocon
James Woolsey.

WMR has learned that neither the upper echelons of the State
Department nor the British Foreign Office were privy to OPERATION
ORCHARD, although Hadley briefed President Bush on Israeli spy
satellite intelligence that showed the Syrian installation was a joint
nuclear facility built with North Korean and Iranian assistance.
However, it is puzzling why Hadley would rely on Israeli imagery
intelligence (IMINT) from its OFEK (Horizon) 7 satellite when
considering that U.S. IMINT satellites have greater capabilities.

The Air Force's &quot;information warfare&quot; campaign against media reports
on CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD also affected international
reporting of the recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
resolution asking Israel to place its nuclear weapons program under
IAEA controls, similar to those that the United States wants imposed
on Iran and North Korea. The resolution also called for a nuclear-free
zone throughout the Middle East. The IAEA's resolution, titled
&quot;Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East,&quot; was passed by the
144-member IAEA General Meeting on September 20 by a vote of 53 to 2,
with 47 abstentions. The only two countries to vote against were
Israel and the United States. However, the story carried from the IAEA
meeting in Vienna by Reuters, the Associated Press, and Agence France
Press, was that it was Arab and Islamic nations that voted for the
resolution.

This was yet more perception

&gt; Air Force refused to fly weapons (nukes) to Middle East theater

&gt; WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the
&gt; B-52 transporting six stealth AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each
&gt; armed with a W-80-1 nuclear warhead, on August 30, were destined for

Interesting article....then I lost any respect for the author when he starts
throwing phrases like &quot;neo-cons&quot; and &quot;military leaders wanting to use
nukes&quot; around.

One minor detail which he overlooks.....for this &quot;Chekmate&quot; op to work,
the Iranians have to hit Israel.....how pray tell can Iran hit Israel?

Entertaining conspiracy theory though, and at least the author got the
correct phraseology down for our incident reporting.

Not so; all the naval nukes were removed from ships and attack subs in 1991-92, by order of
President Bush 41. Only naval nukes at sea are the Trident-II warheads on the SSBNs. And
they would only be used under two circumstances: if Iran does set off a nuke in anger or
provides one to say, Hezbollah; or Iranian use of CW or BW against U.S. or Allied forces in
the Middle East. (U.S. policy is that CW or BW =nuclear, and thus will be responded to as
if it was a nuclear attack)

I didn't read the whole bloody post, but I've always had the belief that
in a democracy such as Canada or the UsofA the military has to as the
government told them providing it was lawfull. (I'm not getting into a
debate on troops shooting thier own civilians) It seems to me any senior
military office that told the government &quot;No I won't&quot;  (As opposed to we
can't because the forces are spread too thin) would be quickly replaced
by someone who would.

Dreams and Fantasies are different. I can see very clearly the purpose,
the intent of Bush's criminal, genocidal enterprise.

It is to control the oil fields of the Gulf, control the worlds economy,
subjugate humanity to the corporate oligarchy. The US population, you,
would not be an exception to the subjugation. Though, you could be,
probably would be a happy servant of it.

They still do. But, the US, Russian, French, British, and Chinese
militaries all discovered not too long after the invention of
nuclear weapons, that none of their fixed installation weapons,
either nulcear or conventional are extremely effective
against either cruise missiles or subrocs.

&gt; Air Force refused to fly weapons (nukes) to Middle East theater
&gt; By Wayne Madsen
&gt; Sept. 24, 2007
&gt; Author's website

&gt; WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the
&gt; B-52 transporting six stealth AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each
&gt; armed with a W-80-1 nuclear warhead, on August 30, were destined for
&gt; the Middle East via Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

&gt; However, elements of the Air Force, supported by U.S. intelligence
&gt; agency personnel, successfully revealed the ultimate destination of
&gt; the nuclear weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal
&gt; opposition within the Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community.

&gt; Yesterday, the /Washington Post/ attempted to explain away the fact
&gt; that America's nuclear command and control system broke down in an
&gt; unprecedented manner by reporting that it was the result of &quot;security
&gt; failures at multiple levels.&quot; It is now apparent that the command and
&gt; control breakdown, reported as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary
&gt; of Defense and White House, was not the result of a command and
&gt; control chain-of-command &quot;failures&quot; but the result of a revolt and
&gt; push back by various echelons within the Air Force and intelligence
&gt; agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and
&gt; conventional
&gt; weapons.

&gt; The /Washington Post/ story on BENT SPEAR may have actually been an
&gt; effort in damage control by the Bush administration. WMR has been
&gt; informed by a knowledgeable source that one of the six nuclear-armed
&gt; cruise missiles was, and may still be, unaccounted for. In that case,
&gt; the nuclear reporting incident would have gone far beyond BENT SPEAR
&gt; to a National Command Authority alert known as EMPTY QUIVER, with the
&gt; special classification of PINNACLE.

&gt; Just as this report was being prepared, /Newsweek/ reported that Vice
&gt; President Dick Cheney's recently-departed Middle East adviser, David
&gt; Wurmser, told a small group of advisers some months ago that Cheney
&gt; had considered asking Israel to launch a missile attack on the Iranian
&gt; nuclear site at Natanz. Cheney reasoned that after an Iranian
&gt; retaliatory strike, the United States would have ample reasons to
&gt; launch its own massive attack on Iran. However, plans for Israel to
&gt; attack Iran directly were altered to an Israeli attack on a supposed
&gt; Syrian-Iranian-North Korean nuclear installation in northern Syria.

&gt; WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and
&gt; conventional weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel's September
&gt; 6 air attack on a reputed Syrian nuclear facility in Dayr az-Zwar,
&gt; near the village of Tal Abyad, in northern Syria, near the Turkish
&gt; border. Israel's attack, code named OPERATION ORCHARD, was to provide
&gt; a reason for the U.S. to strike Iran. The neo-conservative propaganda
&gt; onslaught was to cite the cooperation of the George Bush's three
&gt; remaining &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; states -- Syria, Iran, and North Korea -- to
&gt; justify a sustained Israeli attack on Syria and a massive U.S.
&gt; military attack on Iran.

&gt; WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic
&gt; that there was a definite connection between Israel's OPERATION
&gt; ORCHARD and BENT SPEAR involving the B-52 that flew the six nuclear-
&gt; armed cruise missiles from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to
&gt; Barksdale. There is also a connection between these two events as the
&gt; Pentagon's highly-classified PROJECT CHECKMATE, a compartmented U.S.
&gt; Air Force program that has been working on an attack plan for Iran
&gt; since June 2007, around the same time that Cheney was working on the
&gt; joint Israeli-U.S. attack scenario on Iran.

&gt; PROJECT CHECKMATE was leaked in an article by military analyst Eric
&gt; Margolis in the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, the /Times of London/,
&gt; is a program that involves over two dozen Air Force officers and is
&gt; headed by Brig. Gen. Lawrence Stutzriem and his chief civilian
&gt; adviser, Dr. Lani Kass, a former Israeli military intelligence officer
&gt; who, astoundingly, is now involved in planning a joint U.S.-Israeli
&gt; massive military attack on Iran that involves a &quot;decapitating&quot; blow on
&gt; Iran by hitting between three to four thousand targets in the country.
&gt; Stutzriem and Kass report directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff,
&gt; General Michael Moseley, who has also been charged with preparing a
&gt; report on the B-52/nuclear weapons incident.

&gt; Kass' area of speciality is cyber-warfare, which includes ensuring
&gt; &quot;information blockades,&quot; such as that imposed by the Israeli
&gt; government on the Israeli media regarding the Syrian air attack on the
&gt; alleged Syrian &quot;nuclear installation.&quot; British intelligence sources
&gt; have reported that the Israeli attack on Syria was a &quot;true flag&quot;
&gt; attack originally designed to foreshadow a U.S. attack on Iran. After
&gt; the U.S. Air Force push back against transporting the six cruise
&gt; nuclear-armed AGM-129s to the Middle East, Israel went ahead with its
&gt; attack on Syria in order to help ratchet up tensions between
&gt; Washington on one side and Damascus, Tehran, and Pyongyang on the
&gt; other.

&gt; The other part of CHECKMATE's brief is to ensure that a media
&gt; &quot;perception management&quot; is waged against Syria, Iran, and North Korea.
&gt; This involves articles such as that which appeared with Joby Warrick's
&gt; and Walter Pincus' bylines in yesterdays /Washington Post/. The
&gt; article, titled &quot;The Saga of a Bent Spear,&quot; quotes a number of
&gt; seasoned Air Force nuclear weapons experts as saying that such an
&gt; incident is unprecedented in the history of the Air Force. For
&gt; example, Retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger, the former chief of
&gt; the U.S. Strategic Command, said he has been in the &quot;nuclear business&quot;
&gt; since 1966 and has never been aware of an incident &quot;more disturbing.&quot;

&gt; Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are
&gt; unprecedented, except for that fact that the U.S. military is now
&gt; waging an internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S.
&gt; government and military chain of command who are intent on using
&gt; nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive war with Iran.

&gt; CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD would have provided the cover for a
&gt; pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran had it not been for BENT
&gt; SPEAR involving the B-52. In on the plan to launch a pre-emptive
&gt; attack on Iran involving nuclear weapons were, according to our
&gt; sources, Cheney, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley; members of
&gt; the CHECKMATE team at the Pentagon, who have close connections to
&gt; Israeli intelligence and pro-Israeli think tanks in Washington,
&gt; including the Hudson Institute; British Foreign Secretary David
&gt; Miliband, a political adviser to Tony Blair prior to becoming a Member
&gt; of Parliament; Israeli political leaders like Prime Minister Ehud
&gt; Olmert and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu; and French Foreign
&gt; Minister Bernard Kouchner, who did his part last week to ratchet up
&gt; tensions with Iran by suggesting that war with Iran was a probability.
&gt; Kouchner retracted his statement after the U.S. plans for Iran were
&gt; delayed.

&gt; Although the Air Force tried to keep the B-52 nuclear incident from
&gt; the media, anonymous Air Force personnel leaked the story to /Military
&gt; Times/ on September 5, the day before the Israelis attacked the
&gt; alleged nuclear installation in Syria and the day planned for the
&gt; simultaneous U.S. attack on Iran. The leaking of classified
&gt; information on U.S. nuclear weapons disposition or movement to the
&gt; media, is, itself, unprecedented. Air Force regulations require the
&gt; sending of classified BEELINE reports to higher Air Force authorities
&gt; on the disclosure of classified Air Force information to the media.

&gt; In another highly unusual move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has
&gt; asked an outside inquiry board to look into BENT SPEAR, even before
&gt; the Air Force has completed its own investigation, a virtual vote of
&gt; no confidence in the official investigation being conducted by Major
&gt; General Douglas Raaberg, chief of air and space operations at the Air
&gt; Combat Command.

&gt; Gates asked former Air Force Chief of Staff, retired General Larry
&gt; Welch, to lead a Defense Science Board task force that will also look
&gt; into the BENT SPEAR incident. The official Air Force investigation has
&gt; reportedly been delayed for unknown reasons. Welch is President and
&gt; CEO of the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA), a federally-funded
&gt; research contractor that operates three research centers, including
&gt; one for Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive
&gt; Office of the President and another for the National Security Agency.
&gt; One of the board members of IDA is Dr. Suzanne H. Woolsey of the
&gt; Paladin Capital Group and wife of former CIA director and arch-neocon
&gt; James Woolsey.

&gt; WMR has learned that neither the upper echelons of the State
&gt; Department nor the British Foreign Office were privy to OPERATION
&gt; ORCHARD, although Hadley briefed President Bush on Israeli spy
&gt; satellite intelligence that showed the Syrian installation was a joint
&gt; nuclear facility built with North Korean and Iranian assistance.
&gt; However, it is puzzling why Hadley would rely on Israeli imagery
&gt; intelligence (IMINT) from its OFEK (Horizon) 7 satellite when
&gt; considering that U.S. IMINT satellites have greater capabilities.

&gt; The Air Force's &quot;information warfare&quot; campaign against media reports
&gt; on CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD also affected international
&gt; reporting of the recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
&gt; resolution asking Israel to place its nuclear weapons program under
&gt; IAEA controls, similar to those that the United States wants imposed
&gt; on Iran and North Korea. The resolution also called for a nuclear-free
&gt; zone throughout the Middle East. The IAEA's resolution, titled
&gt; &quot;Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East,&quot; was passed by the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;agency personnel, successfully revealed the ultimate destination of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the nuclear weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;opposition within the Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (mercy snipage occurs)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; translated: &quot;i made this shit up after watching TV....&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; redc1c4,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; talk to your doc: the current meds aren't w*rking. %-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The article doesn't seem to be true, but can't we dream? Can't we dream
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the military refuse the order of a war criminal, refuse to be part
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of further aggression on an other nation?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course many generals resigned, the grunts have little choice, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush can always find generals like Petraeus to betray us, to be part
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coconspirator of Bush's criminal enterprise.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dapra:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, you can dream. Lefties always think their fantasies are true.

&gt;&gt;well, at least our fantasies aren't in the men's rooms at airports you
&gt;&gt;faggot gomer

&gt; Of course not. DIMOs prefer to set up male whore houses in their D.C.
&gt; apartment. The name &quot;Barney Frank&quot;, gets you a woody, huh, boy?

Are these the same nonexistent &quot;foreign intelligence sources&quot; that
claimed TWA 800 was shot down in the episode that made Pierre Salinger
a laughingstock?
The story is so absurd from beginning to end it could only have been
fabricated by someone willing to grab any internet rumor and try
giving it credibility to support his political slant.

Next you'll be telling us Bush murdered Paul Wellstone and pinned the
blame on Elvis Presely.
