Sorry for the double post. My newsreader didn't display the first
one...

A week or so ago, the audible tick on my (UK spec) 1999 9-3 indicators
stopped working. The indicators themselves were working and the
dashboard flashers were too.

Today, the dasboard flashers stopped working too, although occasionaly
came on from time to time. At the same time I noticed the SID was not
displaying mileage information, just some dashes ( ----). The radio
channel, temperature &amp; clock were all fine. The indicators outside the
car were operational, however.

Does anyone have any idea where to start to investigate this? I'm sure
if I take it in to the dealer it will be expensive, so I'd like to try
to isolate the problem myself, especially as it is annoying rather than

critical.

I have searched some of the postings here and saw there are quite a few

peculiar SID issues, but don't understand why this would affect the
dashboard indicator ticking or flashing.

Up to now the SID has been faultless as have all the other electrics.
I've owned the car since 2001. 100K miles. Air con (not climate) and no

cruise control.

Thanks for any assistance.

Ok. I've looked it up now...

The box that flashes the indicators is the DICE. (It's under the dash,
between the steering wheel and the door pillar.)

When it flashes the indicators it sends out messages on the
instrumentation CAN bus. The SID watches for those messages to make
the clicking noise, and the instrument cluster watches for them to
flash the arrows.

The instrument cluster also puts info about speed etc. onto the same
bus, and the SID watches for this info to calculate milage data.

My money would be on a dodgy connection on the I-BUS somewhere around
the instrument cluster or the DICE module.

Cheers,

Colin.

Thank you Colin. That will be my first port of call. I hope, as someone
else has suggested, I don't have to change the SID altogether....

Cheers

It's all, miraculously, started working again. I did reseat a couple of
fuses, so it may have been that. There might also have been some damp
in the wiring somewhere which has cleared after the last couple of days
have been dry.

I'll wait and see...

Thanks for your advice
