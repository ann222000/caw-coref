This lead in today's San Jose Mercury News :

"For the last four months, investors and employees of Hewlett-Packard have been wondering how new Chief Executive Mark Hurd plans to turn around the company."

Before revealing the mysterious answer that has had investors scratching their heads for four months, let's review the multiple choice options. Could it be A) layoffs? B) firings? C) reductions in force? D) redundancies? E) letting people go? And the answer is...

All of the above :

"Hewlett-Packard said this morning it will cut 14,500 jobs, or 10 percent of its worldwide workforce, over the next year and a half."

Oh but wait, there's more, that inexcusably wasn't one of the choices above:

"HP also said it will scale back its retirement benefits for employees."

Trying to make sure a company has more money? Make sure the workers have less money. It's just that simple. And for that you get paid the big bucks. Not for having the intelligence to figure this out. For having the ruthlessness to carry it out.

You know, Eli - about 10 years ago, it became known that managers in the public service of the State of Victoria got bonuses which were based on how many employees they got rid of, i.e. the higher the number of people made redundant, the higher the bonus!
