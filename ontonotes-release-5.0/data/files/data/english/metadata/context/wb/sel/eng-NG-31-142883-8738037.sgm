&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm deeply offended that you guys in auk use my cultural heritage to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;award complete idiots and muppets. You should change it from the hammer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of thor to the wiffle ball bat of cartman. That would be more honest and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;accurate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Btw, it's Tor, not Thor, thankyouverymuch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Thor was not a viking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;correct. but tor is a viking god, you may have heard of him. he's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;son of odin the all father. they live in a big ol' place up in the sky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;called valhalla where they're 24 hour party people with lots of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drinking, fighting and wenching. think club 18/30 but for dead people.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;alternatively, think brits on holliday or at a football match.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the brits at a football match is probably the best contemporary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;description.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. It is the HAMMER.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which seems to be an award any run of the mill auker seems to be given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these days instead of earnt like the old days. how to devalue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;somethign. sheesh. its like american dollars, not worth the paper its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;printed on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You are preaching to the choir, I argued that for quite a while but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was over ruled by some brit twit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;funny. knoxy was telling me you did. i'm impressed rats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They split it in two. Still does not sit well with me. I tried to give
&gt;&gt;&gt;mine back. Then I discovered it cranked the a.f wankers into a tizzy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so I sigged it.

&gt;&gt;cannot say i blame you. any stick wiggling in the af ants nest to get
&gt;&gt;'em going is well worth it. as for splitting the hot in half. if that
&gt;&gt;didn't completely cheapen the award and make it worthless. nothing
&gt;&gt;could.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Stop whining.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my mrs is an auker? dear godd. someone save me NOW.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Get in pissing match with someone posting in auk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whine about auk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;piss and moan about auk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;steal Ari's schtick
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You do realize just how ironic you and the wife's posts have become?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go ahead, show you can do better:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;don't be so naieve. you're not a newbie and you've been arond long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;enough to know that i cruise aroun' looking for people to fuck with,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;troll and get into pointless flame wars with. its not my fault aukers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;make such good targets especialy when some are exceedingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;objectionable and x-post over to the flonk is it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I know, but it is the SAME OLD SONG. Fuck, AUK is a cesspoll, even the
&gt;&gt;&gt;denizens of AUK know that. Why do you think AUK is thriving (in some
&gt;&gt;&gt;mutant form) and alt.flame died? No one actually gives a fuck in AUK.

&gt;&gt;not about anything beyond the awards from my observation which do not
&gt;&gt;seem to have the same value as before judging by what happend to the
&gt;&gt;hot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You can't flame AUK, it flames itself, that is the beauty of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;schtick.

&gt;&gt;in that case, what the fuck do you care if i decide to kick some
&gt;&gt;aukers aroun' from time to time?

&gt;Ya did it before. Beside arguing with Kman is useless.
">

true. i have kicked some aukers around like tin cans before now. as
for kadywhateveritsnymis. i don't know. he seems to have spanked off
and stopped replying to me. i guess he realized he's not the big bad
flamer, troll, k00kologist it thought it was.
