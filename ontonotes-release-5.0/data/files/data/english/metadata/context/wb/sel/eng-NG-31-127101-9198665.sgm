Has anyone used this facility or reviewed it.  Any inputs would be welcome

Prior to my treatment earlier this year i checked them out and got
their info package.
I also met a colleague of my daughter who had combined brachy and IMRT
at
RCOG (by their main man, Dr. Critz).  AFAIK, he is still in remission.
I live in TX,
so I decided that GA is just not too convenient for me. This person
that I met (from
(TX) took time off from work, spent 3 months on a motor home there
while going
through the treatment..

I presume you mean Radiotherapy Clinics of Georgia (not Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists :)

At least one other person on this newsgroup got treatment from them
and was very impressed with their knowledge, care, and professionalism.
You can search the archives on Google and find what they had to say
about them.

I don't have any first hand knowledge of them, but I have seen
strong claims that the success of treatment has a great deal to do
with the experience of the practitioners.  RCOG is apparently one
of the oldest and largest protate radiation clinics in the country.  I
suspect that, if anyone knows what they're doing, they do.

====&gt; since you wanting input,  i don't know if you are wanting input on
RCOG or one of the courses of treatment.

as far as RCOG,  a web research will turn up a lot and you should be
able to get ahold of people who may have used their services as a
reference.

as to selecting a course of treatment,  there is an order in the course
of treatments.

given your stats,  it goes surgery, radiation and finally hormone
therapy.

there are variables that come into play on each of the options that can
alter the final choice of treatment.

for example - on surgery,  that depends on your general health and can
you stand a surgery?   another point to consider is that you could be
healthy enough right now to have surgery, but something come up like a
heart condition, etc, etc that would remove that option from the table
and radiation would be the choice of treatment then.

it's really a case by case decision, with the final choice being that of
the individual as to what they feel is best for them.

just remember that each person who is offering a choice of treatment is
a salesman.  they are going to tell you that their method is the best.

an example, would be like a surgeon at a hospital that has a million
dollar robotic machine sitting idle, isn't going to tell to have
radiation.     a doctor at a radiology clinic isn't going to tell you to
go have surgery.

well, you get the drift.

all the best,

Les,

I live in Atlanta and I visited this facility. All in all, I was very
impressed. However, I put more faith in the doctor than the
organization. I found that several of the most experienced doctors had
had a falling out with the main man, Dr. Critz and had left. The more
research I did, the more I liked what I heard about the number two guy
who had left. His name is Dr. Hamilton Williams. He now has his own
practice, doing almost the exact techniques as RCOG. He has made some
substantial improvements over RCOG. I chose to go with him and I've
been extremely happy with my outcome so far.

If you want to really learn about RCOG, you could inquire at a
newsgroup at http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/RCOGgroup/messages/1695?viscount... .

If you want to know more about Dr. Williams, you can go to
http://www.radoncatlanta.com/Williams.htm .

Or, feel free to email me at johnh at amcoex dot com.

Hope this helps.

John
