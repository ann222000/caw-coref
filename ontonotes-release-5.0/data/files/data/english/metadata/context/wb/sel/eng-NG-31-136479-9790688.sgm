Good morning, one and all!
I hope this post finds you all happy and ready to tackle the week.
Mine is a busy one, but at this time of year, who's isn't?

Great hair, Sue!!  Ava looks happy! Back when my midddle guy (Dave)
was only a baby, we stayed at the West Edmonton Mall over New Years.
What a blast! I'd love to do that again. We had breakfast at a very
elegant, grand historic hotel... can't for the life of me remember the
name.

I should have 6 or 7 teams get their shirts this week. Congrats on
your accomplishment, Christine! :)

Off to the races!

Good Morning, ME &amp; MTFriends... computer problems here yesterday plus
new security system install has slowed operations... I am still
working on it... 90 minute Yoga co-teaching with Sandy on Sat. was a
big hit again -- they are making us the &quot;official 90 minute leaders&quot;
-- boss said no one else wants to try to duplicate our act... so we
are accepting the job... I am late today and need to swoosh on...
healing vibes to Elizabeth and Glenn and anyone else in need including
Deborah &amp; her friend dealing with grief... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;... it's a hectic
week for me since I have to cover office #2 on Wednesday this week --
Glenn: I have been asked to apply for another job too so you and I are
in sync... Blessings across the board and across the world...

Good morning and thank-you for the +++nod on the new do. ME-I can't
think of which Hotel you'd be talking about either. I have only stayed
at the West Ed mall once and that had to be over 15 years ago-maybe we
were there at the same time. HA!

More snow here, even though it was the start of a Chinook yesterday by
the time I got home. I even left early yesterday and missed the
boyfriends' play as I was afraid of being on the highway in case of
bad roads. They had the highway blocked completely going the other way
due to a bad accident. I'm glad I listened to my gut and came home
early. It's going to be very bad out there this morning.

Good morning all!  Today is going to be a sad day over here. My
husband is finally getting rid of the dog. I couldn't do it while he
was gone and he tried working with her for the last month. She is
still so destructive and high energy, hubby's worried about how much
more destructive she will be with a new baby in the house.  She is the
wrong breed for our family.  She nips at the kids hands and feet and
tummies all the time because she's trying to herd them.  Every vet and
trainer we have consulted has said the same thing that she's not the
right breed for our family.  Too bad the shelter we got her from
didn't know what she was. All we can do is hope that a rescue
organization gets her from the shelter.  They don't take directly from
families. I've called so many and they say they visit shelters to find
dogs to rescue.

Jaznmom, so sorry to hear about the dog.  Even when it's not the right
fit and you know you are doing the right thing, it is tough.  Here's
hoping the right person comes along.

Sue, I love the pic of you and Ava.  The way she is looking at you
shows a lot of love and respect.  You must have done a great job
bringing that little girl up.

Back to work and counting the days til Christmas break.  We get 7 work
days off and I've added 3 vacation days to the mix.  I will walk out
of here on Dec. 21 and won't walk back in until Jan. 7!!!  And I did
apply for the new job, now the wait begins...

Had my meeting at the Rec center today. Now, I wait to see what she
comes up with and then will have to present it to my DM. Hopefully, I
will know in another month as she has a deadline for Spring classes at
that time.

Your DM has a deadline for Spring classes?  That's odd.  Both of the
DM's I've had were very lenient on deadlines when it came to new
classes.  My DM is now advising me to try classes in a new town
because I'm having difficulty finding another facility.  I really
don't want to start over completely, especially with a pending move
across the country.

Hubby and I are truly pathetic!  He couldn't take the dog to the
shelter today either.  He's as weak as I am.  We love this dog even
though she has caused so much damage.  He was all talk, but when it
came down to actually going to the shelter with her, he couldn't do
it.

So, Cali has survived another close call!

Sorry to mislead you, jaznmom. I meant the Rec lady has a deadline for
her Spring brochure. You wouldn't know that the way I typed it,
though.

So, where were you all day?

Does anyone have this problem on here when they are typing a message?
I open the message to type a reply and then I try to backspace to
correct a spelling error which is usually in my first line, I can't
get my backspace key to work-it's just like it's stuck.
I have to click on the line with the cursor and then the backspace or
delete starts working for the rest of this message. When I come onto
respond to a different message it happens again. But, so far, only on
this site. Otherwise, it works fine.

Just curious if anyone else has experienced this?
