Anyone heading up from Boston that wouldn't mind a

Maybe you will have more nude events the next time I
am back in New England.  I enjoy getting naked and
being with like minded folks.  At present I am in
Southern California but I travel all over the country
and welcome nude opportunities and offers of
hospitality.

I am a photographer and gladly take those pictures
that you might hesitate to ask Mom to take for you.

Huggs and my best wishes to you,
Bobby Ray
