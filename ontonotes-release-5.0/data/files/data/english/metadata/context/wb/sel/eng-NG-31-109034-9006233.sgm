Ba'athist Triumvirs: Ways to Strength and Beauty

The failure of the first Suez talks is correctly used by most
Ba'athist historians to mark the end of the first phase of Ba'athism
in Egypt and around the Middle East. In this period, Egypt found
itself alienated from the US, whose Dulles brothers viewed the First
Ba'athist International poorly, and thus, faced difficulty getting
funding from the IMF and the World Bank to support the creation of a
massive new Aswan Dam-the supposed hydroelectric power would allow
Egypt to export as much as 20% to its neighbors. Combined with the
souring of talks with Britain, a subtle shift in external relations
began early in 1953.

Inside Egypt, Rustum courted the Palestinian freedom fighters in Gaza,
and the Bedouin parties operating as fedayeen against the Israelis,
funneling a small flow of surplus Egyptian Army gear to them, in
addition to a very small amount of weapons made available during talks
with the USSR via Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. In exchange, the
fedayeen make life very difficult for the British-while there are
'spontaneous' peaceful demonstrations from students and youth groups
that occasionally devolve into stone throwing, the fedayeen revive the
tactics of the Haganah or the Irgun in harassing the British garrisons
left in Egypt as well as their supply lines, periodically impeding the
traverse of the canal, sometimes with the aid of 'sympathetic'
Egyptian employees on the Canal. Part of this, of course, requires
that Rustum do a deal with the Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood had been founded out of Egyptian nationalist
resentment on the canal, and shared with Ba'athism the idea of renewal
and revival, though with a Muslim, rather than Arab, root. Having been
forcibly marginalized for decades, the Muslim Brotherhood of 1953
specialized in sabotage, assassination, and provocation. While Rustum
and Badawi found its religious roots distasteful and backward, Rustum
and Naguib prevailed in understanding the need to make an agreement to
operate against the British for the Egyptian National interest.
Pressure, threats, and sweeteners reminded the leadership of the
Brotherhood that they were legalized by the Ba'athists, and can be
made illegal just as promptly-a vulnerability highlighted by the
arrest of a cross section of rank and file, leadership, and family
members and their selective administrative 'disappearance' for varying
durations. This was later depicted by Omar Sharif in Sunshine, in a
scene heavily influenced by Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible-state
building as a criminal enterprise, and its leaders as gangsters.

While on the one hand during this period there was a noticeable shift
in Egyptian policy toward its former colonial overlord and the power
blocs of the age, though some of it could be dismissed through
subterfuge and slight of hand, a hallmark of Rustum's behavior; and
though in the formal arena, things became worse, in the informal
arena, things became better.

The Egyptian ambassadors to Europe began to operate not only as
representatives of the government, but as government tour guides.
Tourism and culture attachés appeared in the Egyptian Embassies in
Paris, Rome, London, and Bonn during the first half of 1953, launching
a 'blitz' in which they advertised traveling to Egypt. In some ways,
it competed against the beginning of vacation packages to Franco's
Spain, which had begun to repopularize the Balearics as a destination
for European vacation-goers. Egypt had been a destination on the Grand
Tour, written up by Proust as the place where he got the Clap, and so,
the package of sun, sand, ancient ruins and religious clap-trap
appealed to Europeans, helped along by government suppressed rates and
packages, as well as coordination with Hotel Mövenpick Group, the
popular Belgian chain. In some ways, post-war Europe was not quite
ideal, with the recent end of rationing in the UK, though the
beginning of the West German Economic miracle and the general rise of
prosperity made it possible for the rise of tourism, and thus, a rise
of revenue, concurrent with an increase in white tourists from the
more uncomfortable British African colonies facing insurgencies.

Otherwise, the winter and spring of 1953 saw the ongoing churn of
reform, registration, and the introduction of uniforms, medals, and
ribbons to many sectors of Egyptian social and economic life in the
further push to revive and revitalize the Arab people of Egypt, as
well as detaining and questioning those who might 'work against the
collective advancement of the Arab people and the scientific
organization of society.' This, of course, gives the Dulleses fits of
apoplexy, though their pain is eased as Operation Ajax comes forward.
These same statements considerably warming the hearts of the Soviets,
who gradually increase the flow of weapons shipped to Egypt through
third party actors.

The first serious dust up between the West and the Ba'athist
government came in August of 1953. With the rise of the Dulleses, the
Cold War had hit subzero temperatures, and the American Century gained
new momentum and hubris. The Whiggish Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammed
Mossadeq, who threatened to nationalize British Petroleum's holdings
at Adaban as a strategic national resource and lodged complaints of
longstanding British abuses of Iranian workers and sovereignty made
the Dulleses confuse a nationalist with a communist, and thus,
Operation Ajax was launched. Their dream was to overthrow the 'red'
Mossadeq and empower the flighty, authoritarian Shah as a steadfast
American ally, by way of bribing his sister with furs and fast cars,
securing oil resources, an Muslim ally to recognize Israel, and block
the USSR from a warm-water port on the Indian Ocean.

As with all acts of hubris, it was launched with all the Edwardian
gaiety of a Boys' Own Paper campaign and nearly fell flat on its face
right out of the gate. Nonetheless, when the smoke cleared, the
temperamental Dr. Mossadeq was out of power, and Shah, the secret
police, and his decadent cronies were in [1]. In most circumstances,
authoritarian dictators should hang together, but in this case, Rustum
convinced Naguib and the King took the opportunity to lodge an
official protest at the United Nations.

Originally intended for the Egyptian Ambassador to the UN, Rustum
himself went to the UN and addressed it, accusing Britain of
&quot;retroactive colonialism and imperialism&quot; as well as &quot;kleptocracy&quot; and
plain meddling with the affairs of a Muslim state, though there was
little love lost between Persia and Egypt, Rustum affirmed that any
such attempt in Egypt would be met with the &quot;liberated body of the
Arab people&quot; who would defend the head of the body politic with their
lives.

At home, the speech is read by the Prime Minister from the Summer
Palace in Alexandria, flanked by the King, Sadat, and Badawi, to a
carefully gathered, but perfectly jubilant crowd, which gaily chants,
&quot;Ya Fouad! Ya Naguib! Ya Rustum! Our bodies and our blood for you!&quot;

As the countries under colonial rule edged towards independence
through compromise, or through bomb-tossing, many took heart in the
statement of Rustum, meant mostly to protect the Arab world and Egypt
in particular. In their minds, he became a darling of independence
movements, and further warmed the hearts of the emerging non-aligned
movement. He was invited to spend time with Jinnah in Pakistan,
address a session of the Indian Parliament, and Egypt received gifts
from Indonesia's Sukarno, who planned a massive state visit to Egypt
in 1954. Soviet overtures, as per the request of the Egyptian
government, were muted but supportive

In Foggy Bottom, McLean, and Whitehall, the response was considerably
less pleasant. There is plenty of fulmination about how few planes
serve in the Egyptian Air Force and some casting about with the former
King Farouk about a restoration. Ultimately, the Eden government
politely asked the Eisenhower government to politely take a deep
breath. At that particular moment, too much is ongoing in the world,
and in Britain's hands, for relations to be so starkly negative with
Egypt. King Farouk had presented himself again as a moderate and a go-
between for London and Cairo, offering the opportunity to have his
son's government do something about the ongoing instability and
violence in and around the Canal Zone, perhaps in exchange for some
concessions with regards to funding the expansion of the Aswan Dam and
the status of the Canal Zone.

The retirement of an exhausted Churchill and the elevation of Eden
only three weeks before brought Anthony Eden back to Egyptian matters
just after New Year's Day, 1954.

[1] For more, see Stephen Kinizer's &quot;All the Shah's Men&quot; (2003) which
paints an overly sympathetic and simplistic image of Mossadeq, and
wields too broad a brush in its impact. Nonetheless, in the age of
sacred terror, the search for answers, and easy ones, is a powerful
drive.
