Again, tonight Channel 3 News repeated the lie that &quot;We have a very
high tax rate&quot; - (or at least they broadcast a person stating this
misconception without correcting him).  No wonder &quot;everyone&quot; wants tax
cuts. Progressive taxes may be high on the personal income tax rate,
but overall NZ is the second LOWEST in the OECD when looking at the
tax wedge. See the conservative Howard governments OECD stats:
http://comparativetaxation.treasury.gov.au/content/report/html/06_Cha...
...issued before NZ was lowered to number 2 this year.

Progressive Taxes are the engine that makes the mild social democracy
(more or less) work here -which is exactly why the right wing media
wishes to perpetuate this myth of the urgent need of &quot;tax cuts&quot; (not
mentioning that it is primarily for the rich).

You are a liar, plain and simple.

The Tax Wedge ONLY considers income tax, not GST, business taxation
and compliance, secondary taxation, etc, etc. It is NOT a good measure
to compare a country that charges an additional 12.5% tax every time
you buy something versus another country that doesn't.

As I assume you are as well Fred, but it misses the point that we
should be looking at the most successful countries and carefully
assessing whether some of teh reasons for their success ahve
applicability here. I'm not arguing for blind devotion such as
National have for the US Republicans, but that if some other country
with some similarities to us has found ways to be more competitive we
should not dismiss that example as having o possibilty of being
relevant to us.

The shorter url below may work better:

The report is well worth reading.

As well as having low tax rates, New Zealand is also low in terms of
government expenditure as a percentage of GDP - that probably explains
our low spending in reserch, on universities, but on the positive side
may also reflect low unemployment.

The question remains: how can we let the media continue to lie to the
public about our taxes?

A friend transcribed TV3 during budget night 2 years ago. They
mentioned &quot;tax cuts&quot; 13 times in the first 5 minutes. Why? There was
no indication by Cullen that tax cuts were in the works. TV3 then in
the tradition of tried and true propaganda &quot;painted&quot; Cullen green and
called him a &quot;Grinch&quot; - several times.

A similar occurrence happened on Radio NZ morning report who gave over
90% of their time regarding the economy during budget week (according
to documented transcripts) towards pro-tax cut right wingers. He took
it to the BSA. They (made up of media &quot;professionals&quot; -hired hands)
did not bother to look at the evidence and threw it out.

However, it worth a try again against TV 3: see:

It is quite obvious if you know you are going to get earnings
for the long term you are more able to take risks. This is the
same for a business, a person earning a wage and an unemployed
person recieving the dole. People who create wedges
create friction and friction removes useful energy that disappears
as waste. Countries that work together, do not allow their companies
to be routinely stacked with staff who stiff paul to pay peter, make
more money for EVERYONE. But those nations that feed the
lazy, for what is easier than an unconsider wedgey, reap a
lazy economy. Sack TVNZ presenters they are all overpaid
lazy arses.

We have a very high tax rate compared to a tax rate that would exist in a
free, fair and democratic society.

I couldn't care less how we compare to other countries - that irrelevant.
What is relevant as that the current government confiscation machine takes
too much money off us. That is evident in the surplus.

What should they do with the surplus? Give it back to those they confiscated
it from!

&gt;&gt; &gt; and compliance, secondary taxation, etc, etc. It is NOT a good measure
&gt;&gt; &gt; to compare a country that charges an additional 12.5% tax every time
&gt;&gt; &gt; you buy something versus another country that doesn't.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The left like to quote the Tax Wedge because it is a lie. They like
&gt;&gt; &gt; lies...

&gt;&gt; This makes not sense, Fred. The OECD is not &quot;the left&quot; but a quite
&gt;&gt; conservative organization. The Howard government who commissioned this
&gt;&gt; report based on OECD findings  is certainly not &quot;left&quot;! The report
&gt;&gt; states that the TAX WEDGE IS THE MOST USEFUL MEASURE OF THE TAX
&gt;&gt; BURDEN.

&gt;&gt; Also if you bother to look at the rest of the report NZ also has one
&gt;&gt; of the lowest tax rates for secondary taxation.

&gt; It is quite obvious if you know you are going to get earnings
&gt; for the long term you are more able to take risks. This is the
&gt; same for a business, a person earning a wage and an unemployed
&gt; person recieving the dole. People who create wedges
&gt; create friction and friction removes useful energy that disappears
&gt; as waste. Countries that work together, do not allow their companies
&gt; to be routinely stacked with staff who stiff paul to pay peter, make
&gt; more money for EVERYONE.
">

The very system you are applauding does exactly what you decry. I.e. it
stiffs Paul to pay for Peter.

If stiffing Paul to pay for Peter is so bad, what is your opinion of the
government, through the IRD, doing exactly that?

The US run by the right wing that Key so admires and where he cut his

Only 39% tax is taken from earnings over $60,000. It starts at 60,000,
not 0! Overall taxes are still the SECOND LOWEST in the OECD according
to centre right wing reports documented and linked on this thread.
Also, NZ doesn't have other taxes most counties have.

NO tax is taken from selling real estate (unless proven to be a
trader) in an absurd loop-hole. If one owns 20 million in real estate
properties and sells over a long period of time. NO taxes are taken
from them.

A study by Massey University and the University of New South Wales
shows that the gap between New Zealand's rich and poor is now one of
the widest amongst developed economies. Four out of five households
now have a smaller share of the country's total income than they did
16 years ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From 1999:
">

Massey University professor Srikanta Chatterjee has found four out of
five households had a smaller share of the country's total income than
they had in 1983.

&quot;Trickle-down economics don't work. As far back as 1994 the Economist
magazine reported that countries with wider inequality have more ill-
health, social stress and crime. Those factors all hinder economic
success. So even if your objective is solely economic success in terms
of growth and productivity, more inequality defeats that objective.
&quot;The really disturbing factor in the Massey University study is that
it shows so many people are going backwards. Eighty per cent of New
Zealanders are getting a smaller share of the cake.
&quot;The Government claims that the cake is growing, but in 80s and 90s
the New Zealand economy has under-performed the average of developed
countries.
&quot;If it wants to start closing the gap between rich and poor, the
Government should look at the number of people that it is forcing into
dependency. In 1984 there were 79,775 people receiving unemployment,
sickness and invalids benefits. By March this year the total had
climbed to 232,675 people.
1984 March 1998
Unemployed 50,136 147,997
Sick 9,452 35,612
Invalid 20,187 49,066

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which ranks countries according to economic dynamism, the quality of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; public institutions and technological prowess. Finland once again
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; topped the list (ahead of the U S.), with Sweden W in third place,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I assume you are as well Fred, but it misses the point that we

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with some similarities to us has found ways to be more competitive we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should not dismiss that example as having o possibilty of being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; relevant to us.

&gt; &gt;&gt; How one person measures &quot;success&quot; may be different to another's. For

&gt; &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; are different things.

&gt; Here is a freedom index for the Asia pacific region:

&gt; We only have 63.6% freedom from government. That's disgusting.
&gt; We only have 84.5% monetary freedom. That's also disgusting, and probably a

It used to be much higher... over 60% until the 80's. We also do not
have death duties, capital gains tax (long term), and many other taxes

&gt; New Zealand moved down one since then. Why does the Dom-Post, TV3, etc

Maybe because we are being over taxed?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What a load of shiiite Mary - anything over about 15% is usery

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *********************

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BrentC

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;anything over about 15% is usery&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The argument is simply: that the statement &quot;we have a high tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rate&quot; (compared to the rest of the first world) is a lie. Pure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple. NZ is the second lowest in the OECD...so compared to WHAT do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have a high a rate?!  Please answer the question. Why would the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; news lie?

&gt;&gt;&gt;We have a very high tax rate compared to a tax rate that would exist in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;free, fair and democratic society.

&gt;&gt; Some of the lowest (even zero) tax rates are among the least
&gt;&gt; 'democratic' countries you can name.  So which of the two do you want?
&gt;&gt; Some democracy and some taxes, or no democracy and no taxes?

&gt;The two are not inversely related like that.

But you can choose either and go to live in whichever appeals to you
most.  So why don't you give it a try?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I would rather have a democratic society with very low taxation.

Wouldn't we all, but that is still possible if that society can remain
financially in the black while keeping all its social infrastructure
expenses covered.

By and large, New Zealanders have a habit of spending more than they
earn because their labour productivity is poor.  In other words, they
demand all the comforts that wealth can bring but fail to produce at
least the equivalent *value* of the wealth required to satisfy their
wants.  Currently, credit-drunk New Zealanders who simply can't get by
without their second or third 4WD, the $600 cell phone for their poor
and hard-done-by text-crazed schoolkid, and the  LDC TV in their five
year-old's bedroom, are heavily borrowing other people's money,
including mine.  As a result of their dumb spendthrift ways people
like me clean up.  Fools and their money are soon parted, so, unlike
you and John B, I'm not whingeing about it.

The whingers are those who think they're entitled to eat their cake
(that someone else should pay for) and have it, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;I couldn't care less how we compare to other countries - that irrelevant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;What is relevant as that the current government confiscation machine takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;too much money off us. That is evident in the surplus.

&gt;&gt; But if that surplus were not to exist because, rather than being
&gt;&gt; accumulated it had all been spent on silly sports stadia, teenage
&gt;&gt; motherhood promotion, political-correctness training and specious
&gt;&gt; racial-preference claims, would New Zealand then be a more free, a
&gt;&gt; more fair and a more democratic society?

&gt;Absolutely not.
">

Please explain why not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;What should they do with the surplus? Give it back to those they
&gt;&gt;&gt;confiscated it from!

&gt;&gt; Just so you can spend it in such a way as to worsen our balance of
&gt;&gt; trade

&gt;&quot;our&quot; balance of trade? Who is this &quot;our&quot; you are referring to?

Guess.  Go on, take a stab at it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; or trigger a rise in inflation which, as night follows day, will
&gt;&gt; see yet another rise on interest rates and yet another surge of
&gt;&gt; speculative betting on the New Zealand dollar and yet another round of
&gt;&gt; whingeing from New Zealand exporters?

&gt;Are you justifying the state confiscating our money because if it didn't we
&gt;might choose to spend it?
">

An elected government is democratically mandated to take some portion
of your income to provide for everyone, including you, services that
you would be the first to whinge about were you to be deprived of
them.  It's called social infrastructure.  You will be surprised to
learn that it happens quite a lot around the world, albeit with plenty
of those - exactly like you - who whinge about the way their
respective governments go about it.  Agreed, democracy's not perfect
but it'll serve well enough until you can introduce something better.
Please let me know when you have and I'll happily give it a try.

And doubtless also to John B who, you'll be relieved to hear, is
almost as educated in these matters as you.
