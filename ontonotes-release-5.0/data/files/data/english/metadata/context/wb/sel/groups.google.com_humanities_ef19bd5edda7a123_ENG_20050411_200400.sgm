This sort of thing has been seen before in the past via movies such
as Carrie and many other sources as well. Occultism is often brought up
in our society because it includes a large measure of fantasy and puts
the subject in a realm that is arguably much cooler than earth. I do
not think that Ms. Rowling had any bad intentions in the writing of her
massively popular Harry Potter series, but I think it has a lot of
potential for danger.
Don't get me wrong, I love Lord of the Rings, Sword in the Stone,
etc., all of which have a lot of magic use in them as well. However,
there is a vital difference between them; the premise. While not many
people can relate to being a halfling in Middle Earth trying to save
the world, a lot of kids can feel a connection to Harry Potter. A child
abused by his family and everyone else, looking for an escape. I
personally know quite a few kids consumed with the idea that the world
is out to get them.
Then Harry finds his outlet; sorcery. Not everyone who feels like
Harry will end up learning spells, but some inevitably will be drawn to
this outlet. And yes, this is a big deal. In case any of you thought
that witchcraft was fantasy just like middle earth, it's not. There is
an organization based around it (Wicca), and satanic churches as well.
I don't even care if you believe in demons or not, these implications
are scary, and really harmful to our society.

I know, it's sometimes hard to follow who are the good guys and who are the
bad guys in movies, but I thought that Harry Potter clearly was the good
guy, fighting the bad ones. Satanism is different, because it glorifies
evil. Occultism likes to keep things secret, whereas these movies would do
the opposite, i.e. expose these &quot;powers&quot;.
If anything, Harry Potter is fantasy, allowing one to imagine other worlds.
Isn't that good for the development of children's creative thinking,
especially in the light of the same old hat that religion keeps serving us
annually? It's a good challenge for anyone else to renew their moral
message. Mel Gibson's reply with a new movie about the passion was in my
view just the same old hat.
Perhaps there just isn't new life in the old, traditional messages. If they
cannot compete with Harry Potter, then surely they lack appeal, which would
imply that their popularity was enforced upon society, rather than a result
of popular appeal. Calling for censorship is just playing out the old card
again. Warning against Harry Potter while making false allegations doesn't
help either.

So, this is something that's always bothered me. Why do so many
Christians (not necessarily meaning you here) have such a problem with
Harry Potter but not Lord of the Rings?

I understand the infusion of the Christian message into the Narnia
books and why that removes those books from the list of opposition, but
Why LOTR?

Personally, I think that Harry Potter is no more or less harmful than
most of the fantasy children are exposed to. Whether it's being tempted
to jump off a building to take flight (Superman) or hack at each other
with sticks and swords (Star Wars) or kick the tar out of each other
(Power Rangers), there's always an element of danger if a child's
fantansy life goes too far.

And it's not like these same people are normally so concerned about
other fairy tales. Has anyone read the Grimm fairy tales lately? Pretty
horrific stuff, written to frighten children into moral bahvior and
certainly not sanitized to contemporary standards.

I think parent being involved in the fantasy lives of their children is
the key to ensuring that stories do not cause adverse effects on the
development or safety of children.

Surely the issue at stake here is that Mr Potter and his crew are
wizards/witches ie have some link to early european witchcraft. When
the Christian church made its merry way over to northern Europe the had
to attempt to stamp out prevailing religions in the area to gain a
foothold. Witchcraft was therefore associated as the Devil's work and
lots of unfortunate folk were burnt. However elements of witchcraft
were adopted by Christianity note: The importance of Christmas over
Easter (winter solstice where pagans gave offerings to nature by
placing them at the foot of a tree. Easter is considered more
important almost everywhere else apart from UK, USA and their
derivatives) the horns on Mr Devil (only appeared after Christianity
encountered the pagan &quot;Horned God&quot; etc. etc. Christian folks seem to
generally ignore the histories of their faiths post &quot;The Book&quot;. It's
good stuff you know, here's one for you Catholics, a previous
&quot;infallible&quot; Pope (not the recently departed) gave his papal seal to
intricate instructions on how to detect and dispatch vampires. Yikes!

Did you read all of my post? LOTR is pure fantasy, with it's own made
up world, it's own problems, it's own villains, etc. Harry Potter walks
right over the line between fantasy and reality, however, by placing
the story on the same earth we all walk upon. More importantly, though,
is why Harry comes to magic. Rejected by the world, he becomes a wizard
as the only way he can get any respect. And he does not only use his
magic for good, either. I believe it's the second book where he comes
back and takes revenge on his cruel aunt by inflating her and giving
her a pig's tail (i'm not sure if this description is correct, but it's
close). To Harry, his powers are not so much a burden as a toy. He does
not suffer under the conviction that haunts Spiderman; &quot;with great
power comes great responsibility&quot;, and he doesn't hate hate his powers
like Frodo hates the ring (&quot;I wish it had never come to me&quot;). He uses
it to his personal advantage as well as for good, which is why it's so
much more appealing to outcasts than other fantasies.
Your connection between HP and LOTR is really lacking a lot. If
LOTR went more like the following summary, then I would agree with you.
Frodo was a loser hobbit who was constantly beaten by Bilbo, forced to
sleep in the wine cellar, and had no friends. One day Gandalf comes to
him and shows him the ring. Frodo moves into the forest with a tribe of
wood elves and develops his skills with the ring. Along comes Sauron,
who apparently killed Frodo's mysterious parents, and they get into a
battle and Frodo wins. Then the band of elves leaves for the summer,
and frodo goes back to Bilbo. Instead of using his newfound confidence
to smooth over the relationship with Bilbo, he attacks Bilbo and puts
him under the fear of his power. I don't know if this little story will
help you see the difference, but I enjoyed writing it anyways.

Oh yeah,

&quot;elements of witchcraft
were adopted by Christianity&quot;

You provide no examples of anything with any real importance, just
small details. Christmas being in winter does not really change the
christian theology or beliefs, it makes a religious holiday more
socially acceptable, if anything. And really, why does it matter how we
depict the devil?

Not trying to jump in on the other poster, but LOTR is supposed to be
set on our earth, just in a time that pre-exists history. Both
properties are fantasy. Both use magic and sorcery in the defense of
good and the advancement of evil.

Harry's struggles are those of the modern youth, unsure of himself,
making mistakes, trying to do good but being misunderstood, etc. The
struggles are not really about magic, the magic is just the novelty
that allows the human story to be told.

But really, the darkness shown in LOTR is much more graphic and rough
than HP. And yet somehow, people get so wound up over HP and give LOTR
a pass.

I personally think both are fine, so long as someone doesn't get too
involved in them. But that's kind of true about anything. I ran into a
group of religious jedis a few years ago. Scary stuff.

All this whining about Harry Potter is just a pathetic protest by
christians who want all kids to read bibles all day. It's plain
dictatorship and bad education. Give your kids a good education: tell
them that Harry Potter is a fantasy, just like Santa Claus and
Immaculate Conception. The problem is not with fantasies like Harry
Potter, the problem is with people who seek to portray fantasies as
real! Instead of accusing Harry Potter, these zealous christians should
take some potty-training and clean up their own act by replacing their
own smelly parts with a more healthy dose of reality!

in reply to So Hate,
various (at the time) less important details of christianity were given
greater importance by the Church in order to replace paganism. The
Holy Grail in accordance with the importance of the pagan cauldron, the
emphasis on Christ's birthday to replace the winter solstice (of great
importance to pagan belief). Other aspects of paganism were adopted
such as the horns, and a large number of superstitions held in Europe
such as cats walking over graves turns the dead into zombies or being
born with an elongated coccyx being the mark of evil (this was verified
as &quot;truth&quot; by an &quot;infallible&quot; Pope (Innocent VIII) in a document called
the Malleus Maleficarum). I'm not a theologian so I wont be able to
expand without research into this field but I recall a more exhaustive
list when I studied this topic briefly a few years ago. Oh and the
horns... well yes you're right it shouldn't matter really, but the
Devils association with our animal nature is picked up an exploited
perhaps more than it should. What things look like in religions does
have importance, ie the fact that Jesus and his chums are white in most
representations of him (Western dominance etc.) which would be highly
irregular at the time and place these stories are set. There is a very
early Roman mosaic of this Jesus fellow in which he's even shaved off
his trademark beard and bears a striking similarity to the Roman
complexion. Anyway, not wishing to get to off the topic, Harry Potter
should be banned and JK Rowling crucified for her sins against
literature.

If we are discussing banning books from school libraries, then why not start
with the Bible. It seems to contain a lot of unacceptable behavior, which
all appears to be glorified, like rape, incest, violence, murder, slavery,
child abuse, the list goes on and on. Have a look at the following
references, copied from:

If you have any different explanations for this type of behavior, please
post details with references to the respective quotes.

1.

And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but
not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
--*Genesis 20*

2. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know
them. And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two
daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto
you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do
nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
--*Genesis 19*

3. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink
wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve
seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also:
and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by
their father.
--*Genesis 19*

4. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
--*Numbers 31*

5. If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed,
and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29 Then the man
that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of
silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not
put her away all his days.
--*Deuteronomy 22*

6. And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the
tent, she covered him with a mantle. And he said unto her, Give me, I pray
thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of
milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. Again he said unto her, Stand in
the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of
thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. Then Jael
Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and
went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it
into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
--*Judges 4*

7. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be,
that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. Happy shall he be, that taketh
and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
--*Psalms 137*

8. And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh
of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in
the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their
lives, shall straiten them.
--*Jeremiah 19*

9. And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
sword.
--*Joshua 6*

Sam, as one who finds himself on your side in this particular position,
let me pause to say your post is rather rude and unnecessarily
sweeping.

Yes, I think some people have a double-standard when it comes to
elements of pop culture such a s Harry Potter (and comic books and
other &quot;subversive&quot; texts). Some of these are indeed Christians. But not
all. And not all Christians are opposed to Harry Potter.

And as one who has argued for the rights of parents in how to raise and
educate their children, don't you think this post is rather
hypocritical of your ideals?

You are, of course, entitled to your opinion. But I'm just pointing out
that your are being neither consistent nor fair in asking others to
adopt your perspective of reality when it comes to raising their kids.

Sure, not all Christians make a fuzz about Harry Potter. Those who do are

Those who accuse Harry Potter of evil effectively take the fun out of
things. Children like Harry Potter, because they think it's fun.
Fundamentalists even take the fun out of fundamentalism and what remains is
da mental thinking that I reject.
I don't see any inconsistency between my rejection of fundamentalism and
our rights. Just have a look at how the Ten Commandments square up with our
rights:

I. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Comment: This is in conflict with the freedom to choose one's preferred
religion, as protected by the 1st Amendment to the Bill of Rights.

II. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.

Comment: Not make any photos? That's also in conflict with the 1st Amendment
to the Bill of Rights.

III. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain.

Comment: In conflict with freedom of speech, as protected by the 1st
Amendment to the Bill of Rights.

IV. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

Comment: In conflict with the rights of people to do their shopping where
and when they want to, and with the right of shopowners to seek to have a
viable business.

V. Honour thy father and thy mother.

Comment: Loosing relevance as young people are allowed to have a say at
younger ages, specifically regarding choosing their own partners, their
preferred profession, etc.

VI. Thou shalt not kill.

Comment: Yes, still valid, but that's only one out of six until now. Also,
killing is legal in the case of the death penalty, abortion, in war and in
cases of self-defense, with euthanasia in dispute.

VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Comment: In conflict with the rights of adults to choose their own
consentual sexual relationships.

VIII. Thou shalt not steal.

Comment: Yes, still valid, but very much in dispute regarding things like
copying of MP3 files, etc. Who decides what was theft? Who decides who owned
what in the first place? Is property a right in the first place? Didn't
Jefferson, in his wisdom, prefer the pursuit of happiness over property?

IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

Comment: Yes, still valid, but it's unclear what the neighbour has to do
with it. Again, who decides what was false? And what should be the penalty
for breaching this commandment? Eternal hell fire? Or a more earthly
application of force against someone who didn't use force? Should force be
used against someone who doesn't use force?

X. Thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Comment: Another controversial one. Anyway, without going into details about
the ass jokes, it seems to say we shouldn't be envious and desire what our
neighbor has. But why shouldn't we listen to good musicians and desire to
have their records? Why shouldn't we desire something, if we're prepared to
pay for it? Why shouldn't we look at competitors and try to emulate their
success, even surpass them in their achievements? Following this command
would result in the very paralysis of society that is so typical for the
Dark Ages, the times of the Inquisition, etc. It seems another archaic idea
that is out of step with modern times and out of place in the modern world.

In conclusion, these commandments seem to be written by an apologist for a
law and order society and are in many
respects inappropriate in modern times, if not in conflict with what are
regarded as moral standards in modern times. They do not represent today's
culture and should not be publicly displayed as if that was the case,
because that would be &quot;bearing false witness&quot; and thus would pervert one of
the few commandments that still had some applicability today.

I think schools should open children's minds so they can form the
rights of the next generation. I think allowing them to explore and
create through literature is an extremely important part of
understanding that there are many different views of the world and that
those views should be tolerated.

Again, we were in agreement on the original point. I was objecting to
your sweeping generalization and the apparent condemnation of parents
teaching the Bible in their homes to their children.

Surely there is room for both Harry Potter and the Bible in a child's
life, right?

<POSTDATE> 2005-04-19T02:45:00 </POSTDATE>

Is there room for both? And if they are both put on the shelves, which
one will be read by kids? Doesn't this depend a lot on the context, on
how the books are presented by the teacher and school in general? If
Harry Potter is seen as a fantasy, it allows kids to imagine other
worlds. As I said, that's good for the development of children's
creative thinking. If the bible is similarly seen as a fantasy, it
would be OK, be it that it's a rather boring book for which I don't
think will be much interest. But teacher who say it's a fantasy will be
attacked by religious fanatics, whereas teachers who say Harry Potter
is a fantasy will not. That's the difference. Give me Harry Potter any
time, that's what kids appear to be saying and their intuition is spot
on!

My point is that parents should be able to use either as they see fit.
And this should be consistent with your views of family autonomy,
unless there is some amazingly complex twist to your personal
philosophy I have not encountered yet.

I think one of the problems is that we keep switching between the
public and the private spheres. I am talking about the private, and it
was in that context I found your comments to be shockingly
inappropriate.

Do you disagree that parents should be able to raise their children in
the home on whatever text and belief system they wish?

My comments were spot on, as they exposed the hypocrisy behind those
who push to ban Harry Potter. I merely used their own rhetoric against
them, which is totally appropriate.

On the public sphere, I've said many times that it should be split up.
That way, their will be better alternatives for families to choose
from. Currently, public school is pretty bad, but most private schools
could be improved a lot as well. Splitting up the public sphere will
accomplish both.

Feudalism? That's pretty archaic. We now have a more democratic system,

Which seems to be closely related to feudalism: separate spheres of

In both the current system and the feudal system, security services are
controlled by a single party, i.e. government or a cartel of
collaborators. As I've said repeatedly, we should split up the military
into numerous pieces, in such a way that they can all operate in all
areas, but without collusion (i.e. structural separation). That way,
people can choose security services from a number of suppliers.

Feudalism is not centralized. It's based upon the interaction of small

The very notion of cenntralized government or a cartel of collaborators
is made difficult or impossible because of the decentralized nature of

Did I say &quot;centralized&quot;? I said that both in the current system and in the
feudal system, security services are controlled by a single supplier, i.e.
government or one supplier out of a cartel of collaborators. There may be
some decentralization in the sense that the respective local supplier may
have a different name depending on where you are on earth, but the point is
that there still is a single supplier who has monopolized security services.

As I've said repeatedly, we should split up the military
into numerous pieces, in such a way that they can all operate in all
areas, but without collusion (i.e. structural separation). That way,
people can choose security services from a number of suppliers, instead of
being dependent on a single supplier to provide security.

Well, but my point is that monopoly of anything under feudalism is

&quot;exposed the hypocrisy behind those who push to ban Harry Potter&quot;

What hypocrisy would you be referring to? You seem to like this word a
lot.
Thank you for falsely accusing me of falsely accusing Harry Potter.
My speculations are more observation than mad rambling. I have
personally seen some very Harry Potter-like kids reading books such as
&quot;Wicca for Men.&quot; Also, I like how you automatically assume that I think
banning Harry Potter would be the appropriate choice. You do have some
evidence towards this point, based on some of my former posts. However,
I realized during our last foray about banning books that I can't name
one example of a book that should be banned (I'm still not violently
opposed to that concept, but I don't think it's a very good solution to
our problems right now). Instead I just think it should be given less
attention by our public school teachers and such.
And while I'm talking about false accusations, I should add that I
couldn't help but laugh at your objections to the bible.

&quot;It seems to contain a lot of unacceptable behavior, which all appears
to be glorified&quot;

You continued to quote several bible passages which were severely taken
out of context. For example, you used Genesis 19 more than once to show
glorified sins. Genesis 19 is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, the 2
worst cities that ever existed. They were so bad that God rained fire
on them and burned them to the ground. Abraham's relative, Lot, lived
in Sodom, where he was visited by angels warning him that the city
would be destroyed. The men of Sodom basically surrounded Lot's house
and asked for Lot to send the two angels (who they thought were just
men) out so they could do you know what with them.
You also use Joshua and Judges as examples. These are accounts of
the Israelites' military campaigns against other tribes in the region.
There was a lot of conflict at the time, and the Israelites had to
fight to keep their faith alive. They were very successful, and some of
their tactics would be viewed as ruthless at the time, but they were
necessary.
Your comments on the ten commandments are dumbfounding, for lack of
a better word. I was left speechless that you would stoop so low. God
will need to be sure to invite Sam to the next covenant making
committee. I especially liked your analysis of the 2nd one. I don't
know what translation you're quoting, but the second commandment
translates to you can't have any idols. Keep in mind also that the
commandments represent the old covenant between God and the Israelites.
Some of these were replaced by Jesus (who was constantly hounded by the
Pharisees because he didn't follow the rules for the sabbath). The 1st
commandment is for his followers, as it doesn't make any sense if you
don't believe in Him anyways. However, the morals still apply. Even if
cheating on your wife isn't illegal, it will always be wrong. Our laws
are not the gold standard for right and wrong. I am offended that you
hold up the ten commandments to the bill of rights (who is God to say
what I can and can't do? Well, duh, He's God!) but I think you were
aiming for that.
I leave you with this. The bible is not a politically correct book,
but isn't putting political correctness before God kind of like putting
the wagon before the horse?

Decentralization is the wrong word. I propose to have more competition in
security services. Feudal warlords, street-gangs and dictators all seek to
have monopoly control over a respective territory. We shouldn't act as
apologists for the atrocities they commit, so we should reject the
philosophies behind it, including the philosophy contained in the Bible,
which gives Ceasar what shouldn't be given to Caesar.

People have the right to privately engage in sexual relationships between

You also use Joshua and Judges as examples. These are accounts of the

&gt; a lot of conflict at the time, and the Israelites had to fight to keep their

"/>

But are they the kind of stories fit for a time-slot on TV for children,
especially when described in graphic detail? Another question is whether the
Bible disapproves of such behavior. As an example, what about slavery?
Slavery is rampant throughout the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments.
The Bible clearly approves of slavery in many passages, and it goes so far
as to tell how to obtain slaves, how hard you can beat them, and when you
can have sex with the female slaves.

Many believers will try to ignore the moral problems of slavery by saying
that these slaves were actually servants or indentured servants. Many
translations of the Bible use the word &quot;servant&quot;, &quot;bondservant&quot;, or
&quot;manservant&quot; instead of &quot;slave&quot; to make the Bible seem less immoral than it
really is. While many slaves may have worked as household servants, that
doesn't mean that they were not slaves who were bought, sold, and treated
worse than livestock.

The following passage shows that slaves are clearly property to be bought
and sold like livestock:

*However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners
who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident
foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat
them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent
inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel,
your relatives, must never be treated this way. * (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)

The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated:

*If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free
in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was
single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go
free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave,
then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he
was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in
the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.
But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my
children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must
present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and
publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to
his master forever.* (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by
keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a
permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?

The following passage describes the sickening practice of sex slavery. How
can anyone think it is moral to sell your own daughter as a sex slave?

*When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end
of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her,
he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her
to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if
the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer
treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he
himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food
or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of
these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any
payment.*(Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)

So these are the Bible family values! A man can buy as many sex slaves as he
wants as long as he feeds them, clothes them, and screws them!

What does the Bible say about beating slaves? It says you can beat both male
and female slaves with a rod so hard that as long as they don't die right
away you are cleared of any wrong doing.

*When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the
slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave
survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his
own property.* (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)

You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view
of slavery, but slavery is still approved of in the New Testament, as the
following passages show.

* Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them
sincerely as you would serve Christ.* (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)

*Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that
the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a
Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all
the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach
these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. * (1 Timothy
6:1-2 NLT)

In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if
they didn't know they were doing anything wrong:

*The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he
refused to do it. &quot;But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong
will be punished only lightly. Much is required from those to whom much is
given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is
given.&quot;*(Luke 12:47-48 NLT)

You contradict yourself. First you say that these passages you were

talking about God wanting everyone to believe in Him alone, then I've
never heard anything more ridiculous. Sadly, nothing we have been
discussing shows that you are talking about the former.

&gt; You mean that cheating is wrong. Sure, but what's even more wrong is
to

Define hellfire. If you are talking about an inquisition, then it's
wrong. If you are talking about people trying to tell you about heaven
and hell, then I'm disgusted. If a doctor told you that you had cancer,
would you be offended, or would you want a cure? You'd be a fool to not

didn't tell you how to get it, then you should be offended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The author doesn't have to admit that it's a fantasy, everyone
already knows that, it never claimed that it was anything else. The
problem is that the setting hits so close to home for so many people,
and some of them will be drawn towards occultism. The Bible claims to
be the word of God; tiny difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

On what foundation do you base your morality? You have none. I know a
line is crooked because I know what's straight, but you have no real
foundation to base your morality on. I don't want your opinion on
what's right and wrong.

You just called my faith a lame horse and expect me to just drop it?
You want me to drop it all so you can go back to your enlightened
conversations of no importance with Candor, right? You've said a lot of
things during this debate that could come back to haunt you. But that's
not my goal here.
Far more important than any differences we may have is the fact that
neither one of us is perfect. God is perfect and can't be around any
imperfection, which means that we all deserve to go to hell, and
nothing we can do can save us. That's why Jesus came, to die on the
cross as a perfect sacrifice and bridge the gap between God and man,
open the door to heaven. All you have to do is accept it and you'll be
saved. Go ahead and laugh, get offended, write me hate mail, whatever.
Be offended by my &quot;hellfire&quot;, but I'd be a bigger jerk if I didn't try
to tell you. Your soul is dying, Sam, and I'm holding out a cure to
you. And who among us knows for sure that we will live to see tomorrow.
This is what the Bible is really all about, and in midst of that, any
objections seem kind of trivial.

I think the basic question here is what schools should teach under
subjects like religion, social studies, literacy, etc. As far as I see
it, the Harry Potter books are fantasy novels and are treated as such
by teachers. Should there be specific standards in regard to what
novels are to be used at public schools, in public libraries, etc? If
so, which standards and who should set them?

It doesn't work that way at all. Laws can be changed with majority votes,
but our rights remain the same. If laws, despite majority backing, turn out
to violate our rights, then our rights will prevail. Thus, the respect for
our rights that characterizes a modern society protects people against
arbitrary rule, even when such rules are backed up by the majority of
people. The Ten Commandments constitute an outdated set of laws that lacks a
complementary Bill of Rights. As I said, it's time to update such an
antiquated book.

Well, since I've just been invoked in a discussion that I have long not
participated in, let me point out two egregious errors you have made in
this post.

First of all, I have stated more times than I can count that I believe
we have rights. I have simply stated I do not believe we have a right
to school vouchers. Your repeated misconstruing of this point does not
serve your reputation well.

Second, let me point out another problem you often have, being
unfamiliar with the subjects and texts you have such strong opinions
about.

&lt;Burning adults and their enitre cities for engaging in consentual sex?

That's deserved? Surely, you're not meaning to say that? &gt;

Actually, the Bible just says the inhabitants of Sodom were &quot;wicked&quot;
and that the outcry against them among the peoples of the earth was so
great that if it were true, God felt the city and all who were in it
should be destroyed. We're never told what these sins were.

In the earliest accounts in Genesis, the king of Sodom, kidnapped
Abram's brother and took all of his possessions. Abram had to ransom
him back.

After that, we get accounts that the people of Sodom were wicked and
deserved their fate. We do have the account immediately preceding the
city's destruction where several men attempt to gang rape some
travellers (and threaten to do harm to Lot when he tries to intercede).
But there is no specific accounting of what it is that the Sodomites
are doing that is &quot;wicked.&quot; The &quot;wicked&quot; behavior is taken for granted
in Hebrew writings from the start (none of the accounts of Sodom were
written before the city was reportedly destroyed).

In the Book of Jude, written thousands of years later, we find a
passage that says that the citizens of Sodom &quot;acted immorally and
indulged in unnatural lust.&quot; (Jude 1:7).

It is this verse that Puritans would later latch onto to make a case
for the Sodomites sin to be sexual in nature. However, as many scholars
have pointed out, the fact that &quot;acted immorally&quot; and &quot;indulged in
unnatural lust&quot; seems to indicate there was more than sexual sin
occurring in Sodom.

Don't let the religious right tell you what the Bible says. If you have
an objection about one of its accounts, read the account for yourself.

Well, I read it and given the (modern) meaning of words such as sodomy
and gonorrhea, I think it's likely that people do draw conclusions
such as that the bible implied that if certain sexual behavior were
practiced somewhere that this was the cause for contagious sexually
transmitted diseases, and that all people in the respective cities
should therefore be burned to death.

I agree with Sam that passages like that need clarification, because
it sounds like gross vuiolations of our rights. Surely, children who
were burnt cannot be accused of sin.

Yes, and you have yet to support your statement. We do not have a right
to school vouchers and you have presented nothing that supports your
premise that we do.

But the point is that misconstruing my point to say that I believe we
have no rights at all (rather than my refutation of a specific right I
can find no support for), is simply wrong and unethical in the face of
the number of my statements to the contrary. I do believe in rights,
just not a right to vouchers.

&lt;snip&gt;

&lt;Well, I read it and given the (modern) meaning of words such as sodomy

and gonorrhea, I think it's likely that people do draw conclusions
such as that the bible implied that if certain sexual behavior were
practiced somewhere that this was the cause for contagious sexually
transmitted diseases, and that all people in the respective cities

So your argument is with what a certain group of people interpreted
into the Bible thousands of years after the account was written? So
what?

I'm pretty sure so hate wasn't defending the interpretation of the
Bible through the ages but the Bible itself.

And BTW, gonorrhea has nothing to do with Gomor'rah. Gonorrhea comes
from the Greek gonorrhoia, flow of seed, because the original
diagnosers thought it was semen that spread the disease. It wasn't
Jewish text that defined the disease, but Greek vernacular.

&lt;I agree with Sam that passages like that need clarification, because
it sounds like gross vuiolations of our rights. Surely, children who
were burnt cannot be accused of sin. &gt;

So study them. Taking someone's word that people were killed only for
sexual sin does not seem to be a defensible position, since the Bible
does not support this conclusion. Or did you think misquoting someone
who was careless with the text is a valid way to clarify the meaning of
source text?

I have to disagree there, jrichard, there have been a lot of posts on
this. You seemed to have something against school vouchers, although
it's unclear to me what exactly is was. Anyway, you did call for
debate, challinging both me and Sam in the debate group (and
elsewhere), where I actually repeated an earlier argument in favor of
school vouchers, i.e. that they better reflect our rights.
As far as I can see, you have received responses to virtually each and
every post, yet you refuse to specify what exactly you wanted to
debate. Moreover, instead of engaging in a debate on school vouchers,
you said that I wasn't allowed to raise an argument in that debate.

I can only conclude that you have no intention to debate anything and
instead prefer to post nuisance posts. You score no points with your
rhetoric and, given that you have withdrawn your challenge, my
argument stands that school vouchers better respect our rights.

In the case of this thread, the topic was whether the Harry Potter
books would lead children into occultism, sorcery, Wicca and satanic
churches. The deeper question is wehther, if this was the case, this
was good or bad. Like it or not, jrichard, but &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;bad&quot; can
indeed be applicable psoitions in a debate. &quot;So hate consequences&quot;
clearly believes it's bad and is not afraid to clarify this position.
Whether one agrees or disagrees, at least &quot;so hate&quot; is entitled to a
debate and will be respected for doing so (if not scoring points in
the debate as well).

Whoever said I didn't respect so hate? It's Sam who has behaved like a
jerk and made mean-spirited accusations at large groups of people based
on no sound argument. It's Sam who is asserting things about the
Biblical story of Sodom and Gomor'rah that are not supported by the
story itself.

And it was you who made wild and erroneous assertions like Gonorrhea
being a derivative of Gomor'rah.

What you're doing is not so much debating as tripping over your faulty
logic and falling on your face.

And you can keep your points. I have never sought your points, nor do I
think they're worth anything. And you can keep your respect. You don't

So hate's position seems to be that reading Harry Potter leads to a
particular potential outcome. Whether or not he is correct in that
opinion, his position is certainly more defensible than &quot;Harry Potter
is bad.&quot;

It was your position I was calling shallow, not his. He at least

And where in the Sodom account are you reading about all these

&lt; I think that does constitute a violation of our
rights and at the least needs a lot of explanation. As it is, the text

isn't very suitable for reading by children, which is exactly the
point raised by so hate in regard to Harry Potter. &gt;

Well, first of all, I disagreed with so hate, lest you forget. Second,
I find your notions of rights to be problematic. Third, I find your
application of those vaguely asserted rights on a document older than
the culture that produced your vaguely asserted rights to be
problematic as well.

But my larger critique is that if you disagree with so hate's position,
the logical position you should hold is that NO book be rewritten or
removed. Not &quot;keep the one so hate objects to, but get rid of the one
you object to.&quot; And of course, a central component of my larger
critique is that you seem to assert events from the text that don't

Ok, you nonsense about China is ridiculous even by your standards. I
said that whatever rights you were claiming for vouchers was obviously
not a right in China, where the state decides who will study what for
the good of their nation.

So you need to explain to me what human right they've violated by
structuring their society as such, and how it is that their citizenry
has the right you assert when not one of them seems to be benefiting
from it. If no one recognizes a right, does it even exist?

&lt;Do rights need to be found somewhere and spelled out for closer
analysis, before you had them? I disagree. Even someone who hasn't
heard about rights still has rights.&gt;

Yes they do. Which is why we have political documents (ex. The
Declaration of Independence), legal documents (ex. The Bill of Rights)
and philosophical and moral documents (ex. Locke's Two Treatises of
Government, the Bible).

So where do our rights come from, according to you? What are our
rights? What right does vouchers &quot;better reflect&quot;? What protects and
sustains our rights? Who decides what our rights are?

Why can't you answer the most basic questions about what you think or
believe to be true?

&lt;I take it that Sam merely added these quotes to illustrate the point.&gt;

&quot;You take it ...&quot; how ridiculous. Can Sam come out and play?

And he didn't illustrate the point, he actually confused his own point
and bolstered the other side.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe instead of calling for an update of a text he hasn't appeared

"/>

to
&gt; read very closely, he should become more familiar with what's
actually
&gt; on the pages.

&lt;Maybe, but it's worthwhile considering an update.&gt;

DID YOU JUST AGREE WITH ME?! Then I suggest that becoming familiar with
the text should be a prerequisite for calling for an update.

&lt; BTW, what made you
think Sam was a he? &gt;

Frankly, I don't really care. &quot;He/She&quot; has never indicated, but I guess
you would know ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Actually, that's not a deeper question. If anything, it's

shallower.
&gt;&gt; You may judge the world according to your preferences, but the
world
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; bigger than your opinions and desires.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;That's how so hate brought up the topic.&gt;
&gt; So you don't disagree with me, but you're blaming so hate?

"/>

&lt;The world agrees more with me than you think. &gt;

Proof? Evidence of some kind?

And if I follow the logic of your assertions, you didn't disagree with
me, but the world agrees with you, so doesn't that mean the world
agrees with me (or at least, doesn't disagree with me)?

I had no idea that when I woke up this morning, the world was going to
agree with me. ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, I know what *I* consider good and bad. But I would never begin an

&gt; argument with a position that something is &quot;bad&quot; without defining
what
&gt;&quot;bad&quot; is. Culturally bound labels have no place in logical argument,

&gt; and certainly not when they haven't been defined to the satisfaction
of
&gt; the participants of the debate.

&lt;So, are you withdrawing the suggestion that you were claiming that
there was something wrong with school vouchers? Or are you now saying
that you never made such a claim? &gt;

I withdraw nothing. I stated at length why I don't favor vouchers and
what potential outcomes in our system I wish to avoid.

But I did so without invoking &quot;good/bad/right/wrong&quot; or other
subjective terms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So hate's position seems to be that reading Harry Potter leads to a

"/>

&gt; particular potential outcome. Whether or not he is correct in that
&gt; opinion, his position is certainly more defensible than &quot;Harry
Potter
&gt; is bad.&quot;

&lt;So hate did imply that Harry Potter had a bad influence on young
people. He identified a &quot;danger&quot; and ended his post with &quot;these
implications are scary, and really harmful to our society&quot;. Whether
one agrees or disagrees with so hate, to call this shallow is
disrespectful.&gt;

Here's my problem with your logic. You claim so hate implied something
and then you define what that implication is and knock it down? By
doing so, you avoid his words and his views. This is in essence a straw
man tactic that keeps you from considering his words and arguments.

It's your reduction of complex arguments down to &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; that
I find shallow. You lower the level of debate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It was your position I was calling shallow, not his. He at least

&gt; explains what his objections are and grounds his suggested courses
of
&gt; action in the terms of seeking desired outcomes or avoiding
undesired
&gt; outcomes. He doesn't seem to be arguing &quot;It's bad and bad should
go.&quot;

&lt;As I said, that was the deeper question. So hate sees harm, which is
obviously bad. I don't think that so hate suggested that the books
should go, perhaps he would like them to be accompanied by a warning
or whatever. As far as my position is concerned, I've hardly taken
position and whatever position I took is definitely not shallow. I
understand so hate's position and I also understand Sam's response.
There's nothing shallow about being concerned what kind of books our
children are reading and what conclusions they draw from that. &gt;

You should go into politics. First, you reduce so hate's position to a
shallower one, not a deeper one.

Two, I have not said anyone's concern is shallow. I said your &quot;deeper
question&quot; is actually shallower than so hate's argument.

My favorite part is this: &quot;As far as my position is concerned, I've
hardly taken
position and whatever position I took is definitely not shallow.&quot; If
you've hardly taken a position, how can you judge the qualities of a
position you haven't (or have hardly) taken?

meaning of the names of the respective cities and you may get a

There's nothing shallow about that at all! &gt;

So now you know what children's impressions are? What's your evidence?
Is there data from a study measuring the reaction of children to this
story?

Explain to me how you know what children's conclusions are.

And even if there were an indication this event happening the way you
&gt; present it, whether you like the idea of God who does X or not
hardly

"/>

Ahh, a dare.. that's interesting.. perhaps we can have another debate..
Before we do, let me add that there actually are different version of the
bible and in some cases, they describe things in quite different ways. In
the case of Sodom, there's not much difference, but you can check for
yourself at:

Let me quote from the King James Version, but feel free to check out other
versions.
Lot: I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you,
bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes (Genesis
19:8)
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from
the LORD out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain,
and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
(Genesis 24-25:8)

Clearly, it says that the LORD destroyed entire cities, including all
inhabitants. This implies that killing of people, including I must assume
children, was justified and in line with the morality behind the bible.
Public schools and libraries have standards to protect children against text
that incites hate against gays. So, how should we deal with this? To address
Deborah's point, given the many different versions of the bible, it may well
be that there will eventually be a version where this has been rewritten, if
they aren't already there already. But this still leaves us with so hate's
challenge that the bible should be taken literally and thus cannot be
rewritten.
There are a number of different approaches one can take. In short, Deborah
takes our rights as a starting point and thus would welcome a rewrite. So
hate suggests that we should have FAITH and take the bible as it is. The
approach of jrichard seems to be to seek the TRUTH. My approach is that we
should not rule out any approach.
The same goes for Evolution versus Creationism. If we take creationism as
a theory, then there obviously are multiple theories, rather than one single
Truth. We can use the sceintific method of Occam's Razor to reduce the
number of theories to one, but a new and better theory may come up later.
This happens not just in theory - the history of science shows that one
theory is eventually replaced by another one. So hate doesn't regard the
Creation as a theory that might eventually be replaced by a better one, but
he see the Creation as an article of faith. So, again we see different
approaches and so hate dares Deborah (and I take it anyone else) to
challenge his approach.
The same goes for the topic we were actually discussing here, i.e. gravity.

Newton's Law of Gravity says that there is a constant relationship between
gravity and mass F=G(Ma Mb/R2), regardless of location. This is taken by
jrichard as the Truth. However, there are other theories than Newton's
speculations and quantum effects take place simultaneously at different
locations, which does suggest there is some defiance of this Law of Gravity.
In other words, Newston's Law of Gravity should neither be taken as the
Truth, nor accepted as an article of faith. However, so hate who started
this topic, seems to suggest that Newton's Law of Gravity proves there are
laws that cannot be changed (even if they turn out to be in conflict with
Deborah's rights). Again, we have different approaches.
If we're going to have further debate on this, then let's confirm what each
of these approaches is. As said, my approach is that we should not rule out
any approach, which in my view is the superior approach, but that can be
confirmed further if we do go into debate.
So, yes, so hate, I do accept your dare and challenge you on this. In a
previous case, it turned out difficult to make progress with debate, because
the one who called for debate refused to co-operate with agreeing to the
terms of the debate. I hope we can avoid that in this case.
Sam, the one with the superior approach

Sam, you say:
&quot;The same goes for the topic we were actually discussing here, i.e.
gravity.&quot;
Isn't gravity discussed under &quot;Down with Gravity!&quot; topic, as started by

Yes, it's confusing, a lot of claims have been made under this topic and all
of them could be debated in more detail. The gravity issue was first
discussed under this topic:

It was &quot;so hate..&quot; who came up with the idea of comparing political laws
with scientific laws. I initially ignored this, but &quot;so hate&quot; decided to
make a topic on its own out of this. So, the controversy arose in this group
and we can debate this further, either here or at

Before we do, we need to agree what we are going to debate. Typically, this
is a question, statement or assertion, making it possible to be either in
favor or against. Harry Potter seems to give rise to a lot of issues for
debate, but before we start debating, let's see if we can agree what we are
actually debating.

So basically what you're saying is that you refuse to take any side on
anything, thinking that sooner or later you might be shown wrong. Way
to take the initiative! Believing in nothing; this is the superior

There is too much that worked out just perfectly for everything to be a
coincidence. The argument I provided didn't say that creationsim was
following blind faith, but that it is becoming more backed by science,
and naturalism is becoming more and more dependent on faith. I wish you
would try to argue with my evidence, instead of misquoting me and
making completely wrong assumptions about what I'm getting at.

Ackk! I'm suffocating from lack of evidence. Do you have any idea what
&quot;quantum effects take place simultaneously at different locations&quot; even
means? I'm pretty sure it's not backing up your point.

Well, I'm off to go jump around, believing each time that I won't come
back down. I would hate to make an unfounded assumption like thinking
that gravity will repeatedly bring me back down.

Oh, let's move this gravity thing back into the &quot;down with gravity&quot;

claimed that every civilization on the planet recognized a parent's

I also find it amusing that you call me repetitive while you paste the

And as for the rest, I have repeatedly asked you to offer support for

You haven't been on the field yet. By contrast, I do take a position
and I can add argument, principle and this makes sense. You start with
unsubtantiated claims that there was something wrong with vouchers and
instead of coming up with arguments to back up such claims (as you've
been asked repeatedly), all you seem able to produce is a political
view that seems very suspicious given your refusal to answer a direct
question relating to slavery. You seem to persist with stubborn and
silly rhetoric meant to insult people rather than discuss issues.
Sitting on the fence in regard to our rights, that's nothing to be
proud of. You haven't been on the field yet. Let me know when you've
made up your mind to finally produce any argument, or if you're unable
to do so, be honest and admit it.

Yes, it appears that jrichard is making it difficult to communicate,
by insisting words meant the opposite of what their common meaning is.

Not only does jrichard confuse principle with a derivative, jrichard
also appears to be unfamiliar with the meaning of the word
&quot;inalienable&quot;, when suggesting that some people have to decide what
our rights were and what they weren't. When inalienable is twisted
into something that he demands to be inherently alienable and when a
principle is twisted into its very opposite (a derivative), then it's
clear who is creating the problems in communicating here.

To get back to Harry Potter, it is indeed a communication problem and
so hate simply reads the wrong message. Harry Potter books and movies
are meant to be entertainment. The bible, on the other hand, demands
its message to be taken literally, which is why Sam's concerns are
justified.

Ok, justify and defend &quot;inalienable.&quot; Which rights? Which principles?
Why? Who gets to decide? How? If no one decides, where do &quot;inalienable
rights&quot; come from?

As for your Potter vs. the Bible, you are presenting yet another bald
assertion. How does the Bible demand that its message be taken
lietrally? I know some people who demand that, but not the Bible
itself. The Bible is filled with history, poetry, parables and many
other forms of literature. Some components are presented as a literal
acccounting and some components are not.

Why do you claim that the Bible demands its message be taken literally?
How does the Bible demand this and where?

Once again, show us where babies or children were killed. You're going
to need either a passage from the story as direct evidence, but we
might be willing to accept census data from Sodom listng the number of
children and babies within the city wallls before the city was
destroyed.

Well, that's exactly what my concern is. Were babies among the inhabitants
of the cities that were destroyed? Lot appeared to be living there with his
family, including two daughters &quot;which have not known man&quot;. So, it appears
that these cities weren't something like gays-only holiday resorts. Instead,
it appears that these were cities like any other city, except that people
there weren't &quot;righteous&quot; in the eye og this god we are discussing. So, what
is &quot;right&quot;? Is it right to kill babies? The text (Genesis 24-25:8) speaks of
&quot;all the inhabitants&quot;, which does raise concern that babies were killed as
well. Is this god a baby-killer?
You seem to be saying that parents weren't allowed to be concerned about
the literature presented to their children at school and in public
libraries. Are you suggesting that, before being concerned, parents first
needed to present the evidence to prove to you that such concerns were
justified, and that only after approval by you parents were allowed to be
concerned? If that's not what you're saying, then explain why you keep
adding these obsessive demands for &quot;evidence&quot; all over groups here.

Ok, LOT's daughters are described. But Lot is not an indigenous citizen
of Sodom. He was a herdsman who married and moved into the city. So I'm
not sure his family is representative of the citizenry there. In fact,
i know it's not, since his family was the only group of righteous
people in the entire city. So I think it's pretty likely that Lot's
daughters were rather unique within the city walls.

And again, no mention of children or babies.

And my point is not that parents should or should not be allowed to be
concerned about anything. I'm simply pointing out that your examples
are full of hot air. You introduce assertions and then move towards
judgement without evidence or support for your initial assertions. And
you do this in most of your arguments, but this time you were adding
information to a text that does not contain support for your
assertions.

Why do I ask you for evidence? Because you make wild assertions as if
they were fact and then belittle those who have a difference of opinion
without explaining what makes you disagree. You demand evidence from
those who disagree with you but fail to respond to even the most basic
and necessary requests for support for your positions.

So, were babies killed simply because they were inhabitants of these

No, that's the very point. Because the text does not mention that there
were no babies in these cities, it's likely that one assumes there were
babies in both cities when they were destroyed. One city was destroyed

If the bible is going to be your only source of support on this

The bible (which you are supposedly using to back up your argument)
doesn't say that God destroyed the cities for their petty sins and
killed thousands of innocent babies while He was at it. It says that He
searched thoroughly and couldn't find 10 good people for whom this city

&gt;&gt; what you were saying?
&gt;&gt; Then why weren't these cities destroyed before Lot started to live
&gt; there?
&gt;&gt; Or, did they become &quot;not righteous&quot; after Lot moved in? Or, was it
&gt; perhaps
&gt;&gt; that some inhabitants threatened Lot, that supposedly justified
&gt; destroying
&gt;&gt; not only the city Lot lived in but also another city? It just raises
&gt; more
&gt;&gt; and more questions...

&gt; If the bible is going to be your only source of support on this
&gt; argument, then perhaps you should use things that it actually says to
&gt; back you up. Being gay is not their only sin, but they were just evil.
&gt; The bible (which you are supposedly using to back up your argument)
&gt; doesn't say that God destroyed the cities for their petty sins and
&gt; killed thousands of innocent babies while He was at it. It says that He
&gt; searched thoroughly and couldn't find 10 good people for whom this city
&gt; should be spared. And I'm sure He included any babies in this search as
&gt; well.

So, you are admitting there's a good likelyhood that babies were among the
victims? Doesn't that make god a baby-killer?

How should parents decide what text are suitable for their children? You

There really is no evidence for or against there being babies. All we
know is that there were not 10 righteous people for whom God would deem
the city worthy of being saved. And I'm sure He included babies in His
decision. But since you keep dragging this out, let me point out a few
other flaws with your argument.

1. God is the giver of life, and He alone has the right to take it away
as He sees fit. I suppose you could call Him a baby-killer, but there
is a huge difference between an act of God and murder.
2. What people get from this story is not that killing bad people is
good, it's that God has the right and capacity to punish people for
their sins.
3. Wouldn't it be a larger cause for concern if these cities were
commiting all sorts of terrible crimes and the people of the world
cried out to God to stop them and He did nothing? What kind of message
would that give kids? Go ahead and do whatever you want, nobody will
stop you.
4. But the main flaw of your argument is here:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You openly admit to not knowing what right and wrong are, then you
accuse God of being wrong. It seems a bit contradictory to me. And God
is not at odds with our Bill of Rights. Unless you consider all of our
laws to be at odds with the bill of rights, then God's laws are not
against the Bill of Rights either. It is only through laws that we have
rights at all.

Exactly, a murder may be committed under mitigating circumstances, e.g. the
one committing the murder may have had a bad childhood, read too many
thrillers and seen too many horror movies. Isn't that precisely why we need
to safeguard our children from text that made it look good to kill babies?
Shouldn't we be concerned what kind of literature is presented to our
children?

2. What people get from this story is not that killing bad people is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; good, it's that God has the right and capacity to punish people for

And that he actually does kill people who are regarded as sinners, withouyt
that sin spelled out, which is pretty disturbing given that it appears to
justify the death penalty. Especially the fact that women, children, babies,
young and old are all killed makes this something that could seriously
distort a child's idea of what's right and wong.

3. Wouldn't it be a larger cause for concern if these cities were

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What kind of crime could a baby commit that justified the death penality?
Don't you see that this doesn't make much sense when children read this at
an age at which they are susceptible and impressionable? Should children get
the idea that a baby-killer is good?

What kind of message would that give kids? Go ahead and do whatever you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What kind of message should it give? Wouldn't children wonder why there
wasn't a court sitting to allow those who were accused to argue their case?
Wouldn't children get the impression that they and their baby sisters and
brothers could be killed without warning for no apparent reason other than
that some adults in their town had incurred the wrath of a god for ... what?
For something what appears to be sexual relationships? What kind of a horror
book is this?

It was you who said: &quot;..you still haven't explained where right and wrong

baby-killer is obviously wrong, isn't he? Your idea of what is right and
wrong seems to be to kill babies with the excuse that the babies deserved to
be killed because their grandfathers committed some unspecified sins which
was likely to include sodomy. As I said, I don't agree with that and I
cannot imagine how someone can even consider portraying this as good or
right!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The Ten Commandments seem to be, as I said earlier in:

God's laws were identical with our laws and rights? I don't think so! I
don't think I could find many people who said that a baby-killer was good!
It's the very opposite of what we regard as right!
I don't see that you brought up anything new. The concerns remain that the
bible is not suitable to be presented to our children without parental
guidence, the more so where it is a document that claims to be taken
seriously. This in contrast with Harry Potter which is admittedly fantasy.

require proof and support to temper their own biases and assumptions.

Just as in previous discussions, you push your assumptions from the

You need to find a reason to justify your assertion that babies and

and children were among the victims?&gt;

Without a reference from the text or census data, I cannot state how

&lt; Isn't this the obvious conclusion?&gt;

Not for those who make reasoned judgments about the world. For those

shouldn't

&gt; libraries
&gt; and schools? Why throw such wild claims in what would otherwise be
an
&gt; interesting discussion? &gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, you take so hate to task for having concerns about Harry Potter,

"/>

&gt; and now you say that parents are &quot;rightfully concerned&quot; about the
books
&gt; their children read? I smell hypocrisy.

&lt;There's something wrong with both your nose and your memory. As you
should
know by now, I dislike with the whole idea of public school in the
first
place. &gt;

Oh, I remember quite well. Which is why I don't understand why you care
happens in the public school. Or what parents think are good or bad for
their children. If you think education should be privatized, shouldn't
your position be one of letting parents decide for themselves what is
appropriate for their children? Doesn't everything you've written about
the Bible conflict with your philosophy of education?

Shouldn't you, given your approach to education, champion so hate's
views of both Harry Potter and the Bible? Yet you attack both?

My position to so hate and to you is that parents have the right to be
&gt; concerned about what their kids read, but not to legislate a work's
&gt; removal from school libraries.

&lt;So, parents have the right to be concerned about their children's
education.... That took you a long time. Are you now finally admitting
that
Deborah has a strong argument when saying that vouchers better reflect
our
rights?&gt;

Not at all. Parent should parent and teachers should teach. Parents who
take an active hand in shaping their children's education will never
have to worry about what is taught in the public schools.

I do not recognize any right or law that suggests it is a parent's
right to dictate what the state considers the best interest of a child
when it comes to public funding. Your assertion that such a right
exists is unsupported and apparently without merit.

Parents have the right to raise their children, but they do not have
the right to dictate how other children will be educated. If there is a
right, philosophy or law that dictates otherwise, please point me to
it.

&lt; Will you now finally stop eulogizing public schools and libraries,
as there are other ways of education that better reflect our rights.&gt;

I see no rights involved wither way.

I believe in public education and libraries because not all families
have the same resources. And the children in poorer families should
receive the best chance to receive the training and tools they need to
participate in society.

&lt; If not,
then explain why this wasn't hypocrisy. &gt;

Because, once again, you assume too much. Having the right to be
concerned about your child does not imply the right to make decisions
for all children. Having the right to be concerned about your finances
should not give you the right to restructure the society's financial
approach to an institution to benefit you while hurting others.

You have the right to be concerned about anything. You do not have the
right to press your concerns onto others in the form of policy or law.

And once again, I am still waiting for you to cite a text &quot;where
&gt; babies appear to be killed.&quot; You assert much, but support nothing.
Why?

&lt;Once more, isn't the obvious conclusion of children who read about
entire
cities with all their inhabitants being destroyed, that there will
have been
babies among the victims?&gt;

Not obvious without any evidence supporting that conclusion. You've
demonstrated plenty of instances that make some of us doubt your
judgment in reading text and making conclusions, so I'm afraid we're
all going to need more that your opinion that something is obvious to
agree with your assessment.

&lt; Wouldn't children conclude that god is a
baby-killer?&gt;

I think children would point out to you if you asked that question that
there weren't any babies in the story. Have any children gone on record
as having concluded your assertion? The Bible has only been in our
educational system for a couple of hundred years, and almost two
thousand years for Western civilization. Do you know of instances where
children have made such claims?

&lt; Is that the right text for children to read without parental
guidence? &gt;

Well, again, it would appear they would fair better reading on their
own than with YOUR guidance (since you seem to add so much to what it
actually written). But I personally have little problem with children
reading anything, assuming that parents are responsible for raising
them. And even if this assumption is not present, I do tend to trust
the flexibility of the mind of child when not pressured to understand
something a particular way.

Which is, once again, why I think reading the Bible and reading Harry
Potter are fine. In public or private school.

Modern &quot;common&quot; English has nothing to do with it.

It doesn't. Nor does pointing that out affect my point at all. There's
no clause that says it excludes or has to include African Americans

that all cities did have or did not have African Americans or educated

your assumptions.

modern English-speaking culture uses words and organizes its citizenry
in the same fashion as prehistoric inhabitants of modern Jordan. You
offer no support for this assertion, so I see no reason why such a
connection is valid.

What would finding ten cities in the modern world prove about

I'm afraid that once again it is your claims that need support, not my

Does &quot;obviously untrue&quot; ever come with evidence from you?

&lt; Many parents cannot
currently afford private school and they have no opportunity to
homeschool
because they both have to work for the money.&gt;

First of all, the barriers of economics do not impede the basic
rights. If they did, our world would be a much more hospitable place
than it is (and a lot more public, not less). My lack of millions of
dollars may keep me from running for president, but that does not mean
I don't have the right to run. One's lack of an automobile may keep
them from driving across town to vote, but that does not mean they
don't have the right to vote.

We all make choices about how to spend what money we have. I personally
know several children of middle to lower-class children that attend
private school because their parents sacrifice to allow them. They have
this right and choose to exercise it, so I don't see why you see the
government funding of their choice is an increase in their rights.

And further, this illogical assertion comes from one who believes our
tax dollars should not go to institutions of research or the military.

&lt; Vouchers improve this
situation.&gt;

Vouchers do not affect rights.

&lt; Public schools preach things that parents don't like, that's why
so many families prefer private schools. &gt;

Well, more accurately, it's usually what public schools are NOT
preaching that seems to raise the ire of parents.

&lt;

So, parents have the right to be concerned about their children's
&gt; education. Yet, you disapprove vouchers which would allow parents to
act
&gt; upon such concerns? Hypocrisy? &gt;

But this does not impact their rights. Just like parents not being able
to afford a car does not mean they don't have a right to own one. Nor
does it mean that they can forbid any other parents from owning one, or
even a particular one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There really is no evidence for or against there being babies.

&lt; It says that cities with all their inhabitants were destroyed. Isn't

Why do you shift the debate when you are shown to be in error?

All we know is that there were not 10 righteous people for whom God

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; the city worthy of being saved. And I'm sure He included babies in
His
&gt; decision.

&lt;Are you implying that babies were sinners and therefore were justly
killed?
So, god is a baby-killer? &gt;

Actually, YOU implied this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But since you keep dragging this out, let me point out a few
&gt; other flaws with your argument.
&gt; 1. God is the giver of life, and He alone has the right to take it

"/>

away
&gt; as He sees fit. I suppose you could call Him a baby-killer, but
there
&gt; is a huge difference between an act of God and murder.

&lt; Exactly, a murder may be committed under mitigating circumstances,
e.g. the
one committing the murder may have had a bad childhood, read too many
thrillers and seen too many horror movies. Isn't that precisely why we
need
to safeguard our children from text that made it look good to kill
babies?
Shouldn't we be concerned what kind of literature is presented to our
children? &gt;

I'm afraid the influence of media products is not an adequate
mitigating defense in a murder trial. Millions of people and even
children experience all kinds of media messages every day without
resorting to violence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. What people get from this story is not that killing bad people is
&gt; good, it's that God has the right and capacity to punish people for

"/>

&gt; their sins.

&lt;And that he actually does kill people who are regarded as sinners,
withouyt
that sin spelled out, which is pretty disturbing given that it appears
to
justify the death penalty. Especially the fact that women, children,
babies,
young and old are all killed makes this something that could seriously

distort a child's idea of what's right and wong. &gt;

Only if a child imagined himself or herself God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. Wouldn't it be a larger cause for concern if these cities were
&gt; commiting all sorts of terrible crimes and the people of the world

"/>

&gt; cried out to God to stop them and He did nothing?

&lt; What kind of crime could a baby commit that justified the death
penality? &gt;

Support your assertions that babies were killed. You have not
established this point, so stop creating straw man arguments that beg
the question.

&lt; Don't you see that this doesn't make much sense when children read
this at
an age at which they are susceptible and impressionable? Should
children get
the idea that a baby-killer is good? &gt;

Support your assertion that children come to this conclusion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What kind of message would that give kids? Go ahead and do whatever

"/>

you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; want, nobody will stop you.

"/>

&lt;What kind of message should it give? Wouldn't children wonder why
there
wasn't a court sitting to allow those who were accused to argue their
case? &gt;

So I suppose we should censor history now? How much of premodern
recorded history must we &quot;protect&quot; children from in the name of keeping
them from asking questions about the world and human nature? How are
children supposed to learn about their world if we deny them an
accounting of those who have lived before us?

&lt; Wouldn't children get the impression that they and their baby sisters
and
brothers could be killed without warning for no apparent reason other
than
that some adults in their town had incurred the wrath of a god for ...
what? &gt;

I don't know, do you have any evidence either way?

&lt; For something what appears to be sexual relationships? What kind of a
horror
book is this? &gt;

Well, it may appear that way to you (though you have not demonstrated
why you arrive at this conclusion). And you have shown no reason for
any of us to believe children will likely fall into the same
assumptions you do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. But the main flaw of your argument is here:
&gt;&gt; What is right and what is wrong? That is a good question.

"/>

&gt;&gt; Can someone be right whose rules and commands are at odds with our

&gt;&gt; Bill of Rights? A baby-killer is obviously wrong, isn't he?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You openly admit to not knowing what right and wrong are, then you

&gt; accuse God of being wrong.

&lt; It was you who said: &quot;..you still haven't explained where right and
wrong
come from if not from God.&quot; Doesn't that raise the question what is
right
and what is wrong?&gt;

And yet not where it comes from, which is the point you avoided then
and continue to avoid now.

&lt; As I said, it's a good question and as I added, a
baby-killer is obviously wrong, isn't he?&gt;

So now you only need to provide support for your thesis that babies
were killed and then, at least in your own mind, you will have a sound
verdict.

&lt; Your idea of what is right and
wrong seems to be to kill babies with the excuse that the babies
deserved to
be killed because their grandfathers committed some unspecified sins
which
was likely to include sodomy.&gt;

Well, A) YOU assert that children died, not so hate.
B) YOU assert that sodomy was the sin that caused the destruction.

I, for one, don't have any confidence in your judgment of what any of
&quot;so hate's ideas&quot; are.

&lt; As I said, I don't agree with that and I
cannot imagine how someone can even consider portraying this as good
or
right! &gt;

Well since no one else agrees with your assessment, you can keep
knocking over your straw man, but it's a windmill victory that no one
else really cares about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems a bit contradictory to me. And God is not at odds with our

Bill

&lt;The Ten Commandments seem to be, as I said earlier in:
group/humanities/msg/a1d5e7616 afe5ab1 &gt;

And as many have pointed out across several forums, this post is
illogical and ill-conceived. Your assertions are not proof to support
further assertions. At some point, you have to establish and defend
something.

&lt; But more geneally, the whole bible seems to be an archaic document
not fit

education. Interesting ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Unless you consider all of our laws to be at odds with the bill of

&lt;God's laws were identical with our laws and rights? I don't think so!
I
don't think I could find many people who said that a baby-killer was
good! &gt;

He didn't say that. He said that laws create rights, and the freedom to
practice one's religion is the foremost of our rights in the BOR and
therefore that expression or practice cannot be at odds with the very
wording that guarantees the expression or practice.

And I don't think you can make a case that anyone here is saying a
baby-killer would be good. You are the one asserting it and you are
delivering verdict without any presentation of evidence or trial. And
you seem to be the only one who agrees with yourself. So I suggest your
problem is located squarely between your own ears, not in what the
average person on the street thinks or says.

&lt; It's the very opposite of what we regard as right!
I don't see that you brought up anything new. The concerns remain
that the
bible is not suitable to be presented to our children without parental

guidence, the more so where it is a document that claims to be taken
seriously. This in contrast with Harry Potter which is admittedly
fantasy. &gt;

Oh did you pack in a lot of illogical jumps here.

First, you have yet to support your assertions that you use to beg the
question. Second, you build a second (suitability) and third (worthy of
being taken seriously) on top of this logical error. Finally, you
contrast it with a work of another genre and make yet another tortured
and unsupported comparison.

The Bible is a library of many genres and you compare it to one genre?
How is this relevant?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are you implying that babies were sinners and therefore were justly
killed?
&gt; So, god is a baby-killer?

"/>

God gives us life and decides when each of us die. Some people die a
more painful death than others, but everyone dies. So unless you
consider every death in history to be murder, then you've got nothing.
Plus, there is still no evidence that there were babies there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It says that cities with all their inhabitants were destroyed. Isn't
that
&gt; disturbing?

"/>

Wouldn't it be more disturbing if I followed a Pacifist who had no
objection to wrong behavior?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are you implying that babies were sinners and therefore were justly

No I'm implying that God took any babies that there may or may not have
been into consideration. If there were babies that deserved to live, He
would have spared them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. What people get from this story is not that killing bad people is
&gt;&gt; good, it's that God has the right and capacity to punish people for
&gt;&gt; their sins.

&gt; And that he actually does kill people who are regarded as sinners,
withouyt
&gt; that sin spelled out, which is pretty disturbing given that it
appears to
&gt; justify the death penalty. Especially the fact that women, children,
babies,
&gt; young and old are all killed makes this something that could
seriously
&gt; distort a child's idea of what's right and wong.

"/>

Finding a concept's fault based on what it may justify is circular
logic. The law of the bible clearly spells out that the wages of sin is
death. I'm just thankful that by grace I have avoided those same dire
consequences.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Wouldn't it be a larger cause for concern if these cities were
&gt;&gt; commiting all sorts of terrible crimes and the people of the world
&gt;&gt; cried out to God to stop them and He did nothing?

&gt; What kind of crime could a baby commit that justified the death
penality?
&gt; Don't you see that this doesn't make much sense when children read
this at
&gt; an age at which they are susceptible and impressionable? Should
children get
&gt; the idea that a baby-killer is good?

"/>

I still see no proof of babies in the first place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What kind of message would that give kids? Go ahead and do whatever
you
&gt;&gt; want, nobody will stop you.

&gt; What kind of message should it give? Wouldn't children wonder why
there
&gt; wasn't a court sitting to allow those who were accused to argue their

case?

No!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Wouldn't children get the impression that they and their baby sisters
and

than
&gt; that some adults in their town had incurred the wrath of a god for

&gt; For something what appears to be sexual relationships? What kind of a
horror
&gt; book is this?

"/>

Again, the wages of sin is death. It's not that the people of Sodom got
what they didn't deserve, it's that we don't get what we do deserve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 4. But the main flaw of your argument is here:

&gt;&gt;&gt; What is right and what is wrong? That is a good question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can someone be right whose rules and commands are at odds with
our
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill of Rights? A baby-killer is obviously wrong, isn't he?

&gt;&gt; You openly admit to not knowing what right and wrong are, then you
&gt;&gt; accuse God of being wrong.

&gt; It was you who said: &quot;..you still haven't explained where right and
wrong
&gt; come from if not from God.&quot; Doesn't that raise the question what is
right
&gt; and what is wrong?

"/>

Yes, asking what you consider right and wrong to be is sort of like
raising the question what right and wrong are. I know where right and
wrong come from, but I cannot begin to understand where you think right
and wrong can come from if not from God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; God's laws were identical with our laws and rights? I don't think so!

I'm not saying that killing babies is good! But God gives life and has
the right to take it away whenever He wants. A human taking away a life
is wrong. God taking away a life is natural.

It bears mentioning that an omnipotent deity would presumably know the
nature of a person before he or she was born. Such a being would thus
know what virtuous or evil deeds a person would do far before these
deeds were committed.

This is one of the problems I see trying to force a deity into a human
court of law. Our laws and morality are based on the human condition,
and I'm not sure you can apply human laws to an entity whose experience
and abilities are far different from the humans who wrote our laws.

Not to mention that an omniscient being, who sees what people will do
before they are born, would theoretically know the virtuous and sinful
actions of any person well before they actually do them.

This is onw of the problems I see with trying to push a deity into a
human court of law. The rules are different because reality for the
deity is significantly different

Unsupported? Who needs support when there is a full confession? It says it
there in black and white, letter after letter. Cities where destroyed
including all their inhabitants. The reason for the destruction may be
rather vague, apparently all these inhabitants had committed some sin, but
it sure raises the question what &quot;sins&quot; babies could have committed and how
many babies were killed in this action.
What text is best suitable to be presented to children at public libraries
and schools? If text appears to present a baby-killer as the good guy then
some caution is warrented. As said, it's better to err on the safe side and
take the text off the shelves, especially if the text appears to say that
was good to be a baby-killer. Such text could give impressionable youth all
kind of weird ideas.

You have such a loose grasp on this whole God concept, I can barely
comprehehnd what your problem is. God has full control over our life.
He can end it absolutely anytime He wants, and nobody dies unless He
says they do. This is natural, yet you seem to think that it is brutal
for Him to do it here.

Also, you still are yet to give any indication of knowing what right
and wrong are outside of God. Somehow, this does not hinder you from
calling God wrong. When you can come up with some way to describe
perfect without God, then we can talk.

You contradict yourself once again here. You say that God is a
baby-killer, but when challenged on this, you say that there is a full
admission of destroying the city. Nobody was denying that the cities
were destroyed, we were denying that there were innocent people there
destroyed.

Because it is reality. There is no historical evidence for Harry

The idea that someone kills babies and gets away with it - moreover, is
described as the good guy, that's not text that is suitable for
schoolchildren who at young and impressionable age, may take this as a wrong
role-model.

3. God decides when everybody dies. We don't say &quot;My grandma died in her

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; sleep when she was 96 of natural causes&quot; and then regard that as killing.
&gt; How is this any different?

"/>

There's a difference between natural causes and being killed in the
destruction of cities - unless, of course, the cities were destroyed by
nature, rather than god. But the bible seems to say it was god who
deliberately destroyed those cities. Babies being killed, that is
disturbing, especially when it's described as if this was good.

I was going to say that your analogy had a hole in it, then I realized

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that your entire analogy was nothing but a hole. If the account said
&gt;&quot;Sodom and Gomorrah were peaceful, happy cities just like any other. God
&gt; woke up one day on the wrong side of the bed, decided he didn't like how
&gt; well things were going there, so He burned them to the ground, innocent
&gt; babies included.&quot; Then you would have something. A terrorist works to bring
&gt; fear and harm to the world, God removed some of it here.

"/>

But god still decided to kill the babies, didn't he? So, what's the
difference between god and a terrorist? A terrorist may seek to destroy
cities because he regards them as sinful.

It's not the only source. From other text, it appears these cities weren't

bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither
did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty,

good. Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast

The question is what does the text suggest? Does it suggest that all
inhabitants died, including babies that were likely to be among these
inhabitants, when entire cities were destroyed? Does the text suggest that
or not?
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is merely an example of where the
text insists that God deliberately killed people when he decided to destroy
these cities, while details such as &quot;all inhabitants&quot; suggest that innocent
babies must have perished in the event.
The conclusion is that the image of god, as presented in the bible, is far
from perfect. In fact, from the perspective of the values that we uphold in
our society, the picture is not good at all.
Apart from the many ethical problems one may have with such a destructive
god, there are many things that don't seem to add up about the bible. To
stay within Genesis, how can it be possible for earth to be there first,
complete with difference between day and night, with the sky, and with
vegetation, while the &quot;two great lights - the greater light to govern the
day and the lesser light to govern the night - and the stars&quot; had yet to be
&quot;created&quot;? We had to wait many years before the Church lifted its ban on
ideas that perhaps earth evolved around the sun. How much longer do we have
to wait for people like you to accept that Genesis isn't giving a very
scientific account of things?
In our society, we don't pretend something to be &quot;true&quot; if it's clearly and
obviously in dispute, especially when looked at with scientific eyes. That's
another value that we cherish nowadays that's important.
It all adds up to the bible being unacceptable to be presented to kids at
public schools and libraries. We should add public hospitals to the list as
well. Should there be a bible in the top drawer next to your sick-bed, in
case you end up in a public hospital? Just think what that could do to one's
system.. .. can doctors be honest to their Oath if they keep planting bibles
under the beds? And what about courtrooms? How can judges be pretending to
be helping the course of justice if they pretend that &quot;truth&quot; will prevail
if people swear on bibles?
