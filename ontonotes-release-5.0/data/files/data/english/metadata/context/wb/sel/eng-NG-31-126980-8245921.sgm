Thanks in advance!

Used to be that they were two separate animals.  However in
recent years, with the advent of accurate copiers and
printers, SOME people have been known to manufacture
cashiers checks.  Therefore the need for some kind of
certification of same.

Reminds me of what a client told me today.  He had this
&quot;notarized official guarantee&quot; that if the company didn't
sell his business by 12/31 he'd get his money back.

A cashier's check is simply an ordinary check written by the
bank.  It can be stopped, contrary to popular belief.

A certified check is one where the bank segregates the money
to pay the check, and basically treats it, as far as their
customer is concerned, as if it has already been cashed,
whether it has or has not.  Payment is almost guaranteed.
It is difficult to stop a certified check.  It's also a
headache for banks, and it is hard to find a bank that will
do that these days.

So a certified cashier's check is a bank check that has been certified.

A cashere's check is issued by the bank.  A certified check
is when you have your own check certified.  A Certified
Cashier's Check is when you get a Cashier's Check and to
make sure it doesn't bounce, you have it  certified.

I'm inclined to agree with Katie, in spite of the
explanations that others have offered. The term &quot;certified
cashier's check&quot; turns up in examples of various scams. If
someone you don't know is offering to send you one, it's
probably an attempt to convince you of the reliability of a
payment that is going to bounce.

I thought I had answered this above, but do'nt see it. There
is such an animal, relatively new of course, but necessary
in these days of counterfeiting with top of the line

I've never heard of anyone having a legitimate bank cashiers
check returned for lack of funds or the necessity of getting
a cashier's check &quot;certified&quot; to prevent it from being
returned.    Like other posters have said, it's redundant
terminology.

The definition of a certified check is that it guarantees
funds at the time the check is cashed, not at the time the
check was drawn.  Thus the &quot;usually.&quot;  If it's a
particularly good customer of the bank, and they keep lots
of money on hand, the bank may not feel the necessity of
segregate funds when they certify a check.  But I've never
actually seen that happen.

In fact, these days I've seldom seen banks certify checks at
all.  The times I've asked at my bank, they have said they
don't do it anymore.

The fact is that a cashier's check is not guaranteed, but a
certified check is.  A cashier's check is almost always
good, because banks generally have enough money to pay them.
But they can be stopped, while certified checks generally
can't be without a lot of trouble, if at all.

About 20 years back, I worked at a decent sized midwest
bank. a Cashier's check was a check drawn on the bank's own
funds and signed by an officer of the bank.

A certified check was a check drawn on a customer account
which was guaranteed by the bank to be paid &quot;when presented&quot;
----  in perpetuity.  This particular bank physically
altered the customer check so it could not be processed
through his or her account.  The funds were then withdrawn
and transferred to a trust account reserved for payment of
certified checks and the check was logged.  The customer
then signed an acknowledgement that only the certified check
could be used to receive the funds set aside, and that in
the event that the check was claimed to be lost or destroyed
the bank had no duty to refund the check or reissue it
unless an irrevocable bond for the full amount of the lost
or destroyed check was obtained.

This bank did not, under any circumstances, certify its own
cashiers checks, only checks drawn on customer accounts

Hope this helps.

I concur on the opinions above that someone mentioning or
promising a certified cashier's check has a high probability
of being a scammer.

Any banks I've asked have been saying this for years

attorney really wanted a certified check and I had no way to
get one, at least not that day.  The banks told a little
story (why do they feel compelled to make up these authority
references rather than just saying they don't want to

whether to offer a certified check service or cashier's
checks and they (all) had chosen the latter.  (This isn't
true, it it?)

Yes.  In fact the bank doesn't always win.

You mean to choose between them?  I seriously doubt it.
That would be like saying they have to choose between
offering checking accounts and savings accounts.
