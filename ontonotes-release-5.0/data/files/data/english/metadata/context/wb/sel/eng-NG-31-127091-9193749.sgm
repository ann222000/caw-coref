&gt; &quot;Court Clears Way for Egg Rights Showdown

&gt;     Denver - The Colorado Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for an
&gt; anti-abortion group to collect signatures for a ballot measure that
&gt; would define a fertilized egg as a person.

&gt;     The court approved the language of the proposal, rejecting a
&gt; challenge from abortion-rights supporters who argued it was misleading
&gt; and dealt with more than one subject in violation of the state
&gt; constitution.

&gt;     If approved by voters, the measure would give fertilized eggs the
&gt; state constitutional protections of inalienable rights, justice and due
&gt; process. &quot;
">

There are a lot of things that can go horribly wrong between
fertilization and the emergence of a Pwecious Widdle Baybee.  Most of
them result in spontaneous abortion.  Will every miscarriage require an
inquest?  The worst cases are etopic pregnancy, which kills the woman if
not aborted, and the production of organisms which can't resonably be
called human but can feel pain.  Opponents of this piece of forced-
birther crap should start publishing pictures of some of the more horrid
cases, to show the voters what they are being asked to grant civil rights
to.

I have no problem with that. As long as the &quot;person&quot; has to sign the same
court documents and be sworn in prior to giving testimony just like every
other &quot;person&quot;, then have at it! I'd love to see a fetus try to hold a pen.

Uh . ..  it's even worse than that, since fertilization is a process,
and there is no way to tell when and if an ova has been fertilized,
and most of the fertilized ova don't implant.  Good luck trying to
enforce such a law!

Typical assholery of the antiabort fetusfelchers.  They are insane.

yes, It's another attempt at joining religion and the state.  We don't
need judges in the operating room. Medical decisions should be made
between the patient and his/her doctor.
Keep Big Brother out of it.

[snip pro-liar insanity that's more insane than usual]

Fertilized eggs are sometimes flushed out with one's menstruum. Us gals
should mail a huge package of our used tampons and pads to Kristi Burton, the
20-year-old fetus freak who organized this nutballery, with a note asking her
if she'd like to hold funerals for all the little dead baybees therein.
