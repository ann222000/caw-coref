I have a Black Walnut Tree that is growing wild in my yard.  The tree
has seed/nut on it.  I would like to use the nuts to grow other Black
Walnut trees on my property.  How do I do this?

Stratification helps, Either in a secure outside storage, or in a brown bag
in the refrigerator.  Let em over winter, and plant in the spring.

I believe the word you want is 'scarification'.

No, it's stratification.  That means to subject a seed to a cold
period before it germinates.  If you weren't so busy trying to prove
people wrong you'd know this.

I'd just plant a few in the ground in a straight line.  Transplant if
any come up.  Tell the folks on the property  that these trees offer
valuable woods in time and  that once folks used the seed for a tasty
brittle. Which is still worth seeking out.

Forget peanut brittle go Black Walnut if we must jeopardize our old
fillings.  I do!

With black walnut it's important to scarify (really just removing the
husks), then plant the seeds, the natural exposure to winter while in
the ground is all the stratification that's necessary, come spring
they'll already be germinating... otherwise come spring all you'll
have is cold walnuts in the fridge of which most when planted then
will not germinate because they haven't been scarified, and then those
really should be planted in the fall, so you lose a year.  All things
equal, without scarification most walnut seeds do not germinate (in
nature left to their own devices most do not germinate), most that
have been scarified do germinate.  There is no need to artificially
stratify black walnut but it's important to scarify.  What is most
important is to protect newly planted seed from critters otherwise
whatever you do is all for nought, squirrels will probably dig up
90pct.  I would plant black walnut in individual pots that are well
protected from critters (a cold frame is good).  Protect pots until
they can be field planted as two year old seedlings, and then they'll
still neeed protection from deer and other critters.  You obviously
didn't read the OP carefully... my recommendation is more advantageous

I lived in a house that had one Black Walnut and a couple of English
Walnut trees.  You're right - absolutely nothing would grow under the
Black Walnut.  We ended up pouring a nice patio around it.  The
English Walnuts weren't much better, but I did manage to have a nice
garden of Calla Lilies under one of them.  I was certain to try to
keep any falling leaves from the tree, gathered and raked up however!

i have a Chinese dogwood as understory to my bigger black
walnut &amp; it's doing very well. the walnut is around 40 years,
&amp; the dogwood is about 30. they are less than 3' apart.
OTOH, there used to be an apple tree near the walnut &amp; as the
crown began to overhang the apple's area, it died back. i
recently cut it down. and the blueberries are also dying back,
but that could be because they're in pretty heavy shade from
the sugar maples, as well as the effects of juglone.
the younger black walnut is in my 'winter' pasture &amp; i *wish*
it would kill the weeds that grow under it :p

Delusions of grandeur cloud your mind yet again, Sheldon.

I take care of a farm in a nearby town that has a 1/2 mile driveway
lined with black walnuts.  There is no 'scarification' of any seeds,
and they come up all over the place - after they've spent the winter
outside where the squirrels decide to plant them.

While scarifying is an alternative, it is not necessary, any more than
stratification.  It may influence germination, but in nature, it doesn't
happen that much, scarification that is.  Nursery's stratify black walnut,
but seldom scarify, just as they stratify other seed.  Particularly in

In nature, scarification happens by a seed coat being gradually worn

to speed this up (with cutting a notch and hot water seeming to be the

Getting some instructions from someone who has propagated the

seeds are needed for one seeding, or whether the seed passes through
the digestive tract of a bird or mammal in nature, or whether you can
keep a seed in the ground for months/years and recognize it as a
non-weed when it does come up, or whatever, make the garden situation
often different.

There are no animals where black walnut grows that eat black walnut
seed whole... if ever you come upon a squirrel swallowing black walnut
seed whole you'd best don your steel safety cup and get the hell outa
there fast as your widdle stumps can run.

No need to back peddle and hide behind ignorance.  There are plenty of
web sites with expert instructions about how to grow black walnut (I
read a few before posting just as a refresher, I'm not a walnut tree
maven but I've lots of hickory).  Under how to plant all begin by
describing how to scarify, remove the husk and notch the shell.  Then
they go on to describe about stratification, only necessary in warm
climes or with large wood stand/nut harvesting operations where seed
will be planted later.  But this is about someone with a tree in his
yard who merely wants to grow a few seeds... someone who as yet
refuses to say where.

Do all of yoose go through life making mountains out of molehills,
what a bunch or wild exaggeraters.  Just answer the question that's
asked, stop embellishing with the barroom lush BS... just makes you
appear very ignorant.

You're wrong, stratification is always necessary... scarifying is
not.  But in the case at hand, a small backyard operation, it is
important to scarify to increase rate of germination.  In most cases
stratification occurs naturally, but the OP refuses to say where.  As
per usual usenet practice the regulars argue while the OP never
returns... this was probably yet another troll.

the same, you said scarification is to remove the husk, wrong, it is to

All nuts have one problem, you can't get them to germinate if they stay
dry too long.   I have grown several varieties of nuts, including the
English walnut but not the black walnut.   I just put all the nuts in a
large tin with some moist compost, and the lid on to stop vermin eating
them, and left them in a shed.   This was in England with cold winters.
It saved refridgerator space.   In early spring (late March) I tipped
the lot out, sorted out those that had started to grow and potted them
on.   My interest in growing them was to see if I could Bonsai them.
I had a lot more than I needed and thinking back on that time there was
probably about 50% success.                   BigalJim Kingdon;748613 Wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been a forester for 40 years.  The process is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same, you said scarification is to remove the husk, wrong, it is to
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce the thickness of the shell.  Moisture and freezing does that in
&gt;&gt;&gt; nature, stratification as well.  But in a nursery, you will note the
&gt;&gt;&gt; following phrase, stratification is necessary in the deep south.

&gt;&gt; In nature, scarification happens by a seed coat being gradually worn

&gt;&gt; to speed this up (with cutting a notch and hot water seeming to be the
&gt;&gt; preferred techniques). At least, that's what my book on propagating
&gt;&gt; woody plants says.

&gt;&gt; But each plant is different.  And I don't know anything about black
&gt;&gt; walnut in particular.

&gt;&gt; Getting some instructions from someone who has propagated the
&gt;&gt; particular plant in question is recommended.  Sure in nature, the
&gt;&gt; plant grows (somehow).  But whether this happens quickly, or how many
&gt;&gt; seeds are needed for one seeding, or whether the seed passes through
&gt;&gt; the digestive tract of a bird or mammal in nature, or whether you can
&gt;&gt; keep a seed in the ground for months/years and recognize it as a
&gt;&gt; non-weed when it does come up, or whatever, make the garden situation
&gt;&gt; often different.

&gt; There are no animals where black walnut grows that eat black walnut
&gt; seed whole... if ever you come upon a squirrel swallowing black walnut
&gt; seed whole you'd best don your steel safety cup and get the hell outa
&gt; there fast as your widdle stumps can run.

&gt; No need to back peddle and hide behind ignorance.  There are plenty of
&gt; web sites with expert instructions about how to grow black walnut (I
&gt; read a few before posting just as a refresher, I'm not a walnut tree
&gt; maven but I've lots of hickory).  Under how to plant all begin by
&gt; describing how to scarify, remove the husk and notch the shell.  Then
&gt; they go on to describe about stratification, only necessary in warm
&gt; climes or with large wood stand/nut harvesting operations where seed
&gt; will be planted later.  But this is about someone with a tree in his
&gt; yard who merely wants to grow a few seeds... someone who as yet
&gt; refuses to say where.

&gt; Do all of yoose go through life making mountains out of molehills,
&gt; what a bunch or wild exaggeraters.  Just answer the question that's
&gt; asked, stop embellishing with the barroom lush BS... just makes you
&gt; appear very ignorant.

I did a Google search on Black Walnuts and did not find any useful
information.  This pamphlet was very helpful - thank you.

I am going to plant the seeds in pots with good garden soil and let them
stay on my patio for the winter.  I will cover the pots with wire to
deter predation by squirrels.  Hopefully some of them will sprout.

Any sapling I would plant in the summer/fall of 2008.

Where is your story Don Staples?  Please stop being nasty and stop saying
nasty things to people on this list.  You are the only person I know who
talks the way you do.  You are an exception to the forestry industry.  Your
behavior is out of line with many fine foresters.  You are surely not an
example of what a forester is.

Ignorance of tree biology has been, and still is, the major cause of tree
problems worldwide.  Shigo 1999

Don  I am living off of an understanding of tree biology greatly in part as
a direct result of the teachings of Dr. Alex L. Shigo.  What is it that you
are trying to say?

Also I have learned a great deal about the ecological stages of trees by
many other people by reading what they have written and by walking in old
growth forest with such an understanding in mind.
E.g.,
http://www.treedictionary.com/DICT2003/hardtoget/jk-79html/index.html

and

http://www.treedictionary.com/DICT2003/hardtoget/jk-64-html/index.html

and

http://www.treedictionary.com/DICT2003/hardtoget/jk-98/index.html

If you look here you will find articles by Dr. Alex L. Shigo
http://www.treedictionary.com/DICT2003/hardtoget/index.html

Also a great deal of the tree biology workshops I attended addressed many
issues dealing with the biology of trees.  That is the biology I have and am
still studying.
