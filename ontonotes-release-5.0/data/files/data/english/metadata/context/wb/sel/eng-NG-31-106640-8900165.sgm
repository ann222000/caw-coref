By the way, never charge less than $35 for pedis for basic and more for spa pedis, of course. When clients have the nerve to come in and straight away from a hike and the feet are skanky you better charge them for it!

Thank you all for the responses! Now you all have me scared, I will
definitley take the free thing away. I had 5 dollars off for a little
while but maybe I didn't give it a chance. I know I need to make money
because I am buying all my product and it seems never ending on the
stuff you can buy. I just need to be patient but its frustrating when
you want the practice. I am in Rockford, IL for all that wanted to
know. One of the stylist told me that September was slow because
school was starting so I think I should go back to the 5 dollar thing
and wait a while. I also had an Idea of calling foot Dr.s to see if
they would keep my card and recomend me. What do you guys think?
Thanks again.

I started working at a nails only salon and there was 6 total&gt; nail techs and I wasn't the only new one. That was really hard to get&gt; a clientle. When I wasn't at work the other girls would give services&gt; to the other new girl or they would take them for themselves. So, I&gt; decided to switch salons. Now I work at a hair salon and I am the only&gt; nail tech their. I thought that this would be good for me to build a&gt; clientle but now I wish I had another girl there for me to ask&gt; questions to and just have someone there who new what I was doing. The&gt; hair stylist there like to give me advice, and don't get me wrong I&gt; appreciate all the advice I can get but sometimes I wonder if they&gt; even know what they are talking about. I would love
any advice from&gt; all of you on how to build a clientle. I have just started to run a&gt; special. Free mani or pedi for first time clients or 1/2 off a full&gt; set. Anyways, thanks for letting me ramble.

We just ran a Pedicure Special for the month of August:
Purchase 4 pedicures get your 5th for free.  I would put an expiration  date
on this say 6 or 7 months...this way it will keep those pedicures coming in
through the fall and a little past the holidays.  It's going to work like a
gift certificate specifically for pedicures.   It was immensely  popular, but we
have a huge pedicure following in our salon.

Hi Everyone!!

I graduated school on August 30th!  I landed a job in a brand new hair salon with me as their only tech!  I have had a couple weeks experience with another salon that does not have hardly any walk ins.  Question:  I have to make up a menu.  I have only done ONE set of acrylics on a human. TWO sets of gels (in school) and ONE set of silks.  Now, I am scared to death because the owner of the salon is counting on me for her clients to like the nail part of the salon.  I am going to practice on my neighbor today, but I had used Clarite in school, then the one time, Absolute.  It hardened so fast....and freaked me out!  Visiting a nail supply store yesterday, the girl recommended Brisa for gels, Solar Nail for acrylics.  She said these sold the most.  Now, I am in a small town in Georgia, near the mountains.  However, we are coming into our tourist season, and I am a little cofused on prices and cannot figure out a menu.  I looked at the salons around here, and of course, I am
the ONLY english-speaking nail tech for 20 miles.  This is good, I know, BUT how can I charge for the nails?  They don't speak english, I am new!!!

Any suggestions!

Thanks!  Beth.

Hi Beth,
Congrat on finishing school and starting a really fun career! First things first: you need to decide on a product line to use. you will see that there are several that will be mentioned in this group but it's a personal choice. I personally love Creative's liquid and powder and the acidless primer. I'm still trying to figure out what gel i was to use but for now i'm using LeChat and it's ok. there are a few of those you'll read about here as well. I've been hearing alot about NSI gels so that's my next adventure. I'm currently fighting with Pink &amp; White acrylics because i just don't want to do it so i have conditioned myself to thinking and believing it's too hard and unnecessary but the fact that some spas and salons are getting $75-85 for a set of P&amp;W; i've been forced to reconsider my mental p&amp;w conditioning. check out the surrounding salons and see what they are charging and go from there.

Beth,
First of all, congrats to you on graduating and getting into the salon so quickly! One thing I have to say is, I have found that the people in the supply houses rarely know enough about OUR products to give a fully educated answer. Yes, they can tell you what sells the best but that's about it. No offense to anyone who uses the products she suggested to you but I'd not go wtih them. I have nothing against Brisa but using 'Solar Nail' for your acrylics screams NSS to those who know the issues we face with the NSS. There are many other choices out there. You don't have to use Creative or OPI. Our new spa chose to go with Light Elegance for gels and Entity for acrylics. We will lean towards LE because of the odor and because the other nail tech I'm working with is an educator for LE. Other companies who offer gels are: Akzentz, Vicki Peters and Young Nails, among others. Some other acrylic companies are: Vicki Peters and Young Nails. Vicki Peters will send you a free sample of her acrylic (both regular and odorless) and YN will send you a sample of both their gel and acrylic lines. Just go to their sites to get the number to call. www.kupainc.com for VP and www.youngnails.com for YN. YN and Entity both have two different acrylics, one that sets faster than the other. I personally prefer to go with a company who doesn't sell through a supply house. Both products we're using currently only sell to licensed people and you get them from the company.

There are a couple people that are willing to send you their menus to get ideas from. You might also want to post that on the regular Beauty Tech message board. Colleen is one of the ones who has sent me hers before and it's gorgeous!Maybe someone that is more in your area can give you an idea on how much you can charge. One thing I've always heard is that you shouldn't start your prices really low just to get people in the door. It's way too hard to raise them up later. Some people also say that no matter what part of the country you're in you can still charge $80-$90 for a full set. I don't believe that. Even the highest priced spa in our area doesn't charge that. We're a mill town. People don't/won't pay that much.

Keep posting your questions both here and on the message board. Some people don't read both places so you're going to hit different people if you use both sites. Good luck to you!!!

Michele

One other thing I was thinking of that I forgot to mention is the Light Elegance Colorz. They have a ton of gel polishes and come out with three new ones each season. I'm LOVING these! The clients are loving them as well. I've used the gel polish with nearly every client since I've been there. We charge $12 extra for the gel polish and people don't flinch. It's dry as soon as you get the top coat cured and it lasts and lasts. www.lightelegance.com . If you ever have any questions about LE, Kahne posts on the Beauty Tech board and 'Liz in OR' has been a user for 4 years. Both are very knowledgeable with the products. I also happen to know several people who use different lines (or only use acrylics) but use and love the LE Colorz.

Hey Michele:  Thank you for your response!  I will tell you that I am so confused by all that is out there for us, that I don't know what to do!  I want to start out with good products, and a menu!  I don't have any money, so the owner  is buying all the supplies to start.  I don't want to scare her off (would she be scared?), but I want to be (or appear to be) knowledgeable about which products I want.  Also, do you think that by starting out with just one kind of enhancement (like just acyrlics or just gels, etc) would be better?  Then, just offer additional types as I grow stronger?  Confused, so confused!!!! HELP!!!

What are you more comfortable with...gels or acrylics? I think it's good to offer both if you're comfortable with both. Having a company educator there with me all the time makes me more comfortable with gels. We want to focus on gels mainly but we also don't want to lose customers simply by not offering acrylics. One thing we don't offer at all is wraps. Don't see a need for them and don't like doing them! If you have any chance to attend any classes, no matter what the manufacturer, go to them! Watch the videos on the YN and VP sites. Pick up some DVD/Videos from companies who offer them. Post in the Swap &amp; Shop section of the message board that you're looking for videos if anyone has any to sell. You will get a wealth of information from this email group and the message board so utilize it like you already are!

She shouldn't be scared. If anything she should be thrilled that you're willing to stay connected with the industry and learn all you can! Here in WA state we don't have CEU so there are a lot of techs here that have been in the industry a long time and simply don't know the new stuff that is out there. Check out some of the pictures lilladyred has posted on the message board. Wow! YN is really into art. Some people just don't like it but if you can do that kind of stuff you'll set yourself apart from the ones who don't further their education. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with plain pink and whites but there is so much more out there! Be different than others if you can. Like I said, the gel polish is different too! You know, just by using white acrylic in your pink and whites will set you off from the NSS since they usually use clear acrylic and paint on their white, which will gradually wear off. The white acrylic won't do that.

It really can be confusing and intimidating with everything that is out there. We used OPI in school. Until I was almost out of school I didn't realize there was much more out there. THEN I found the Beauty Tech message board. LOL I was exposed to a whole new world of products. There is so much more out there. You can get the free samples from VP and YN and you can do that yourself since it doesn't cost anything. You don't have to worry about asking the owner to get them for you. Also call Nailite ( www.nailiteinc.com ) and tell them you're a new tech and want to know if they still send out a free good box of their products. Lisa there is great! THey used to send out samples (full size containers) of gels and acrylics for you to try.

You will hear a lot that acrylics come from only three different manufacturers. This is true as far as I know but that doesn't mean that there are only three grades of acrylic. There are three companies that make the acrylic for all the different companies (YN, VP, TT, Entity, OPI, etc.) but each of the acrylic manufacturers can create different grades of acrylic dependant on what the company they're making it for wants. So there are some very different levels of quality out there.

Keep posting questions and you'll keep getting answers. I've only been licensed for about a year and a half but up until recently I've solely worked with elderly people doing natural nail care so going into this new shop is a whole new thing for me and it's scary! I'm relearning it all again it feels like

Hi Beth,

Congratulations, and welcome!  The best way is to check around and see what
the other salons in your area are charging and set your prices accordingly -
maybe a couple of dollars less, but NOT much more than that.   Its hard
being new and the only tech in a salon.  Go to tradeshows and networking
events and there are highly experienced techs in this group that are willing
to help you with product information and application skills.  Stay confident
and you'll be fine!

Hey Sylvia:  I have checked the salons in the area.  They are ALL Asian Shops!  I will be the FIRST english speaking american nail tech for 20 miles radius (sweet, eh??).  All their prices are cheap.  So, should my prices be between their shops and an experienced american/english tech?

&gt; Thank you all for the responses! Now you all have me scared, I will
&gt;definitley take the free thing away. I had 5 dollars off for a little
&gt;while but maybe I didn't give it a chance. I know I need to make money
&gt;because I am buying all my product and it seems never ending on the
&gt;stuff you can buy. I just need to be patient but its frustrating when
&gt;you want the practice. I am in Rockford, IL for all that wanted to
&gt;know. One of the stylist told me that September was slow because
&gt;school was starting so I think I should go back to the 5 dollar thing
&gt;and wait a while. I also had an Idea of calling foot Dr.s to see if
&gt;they would keep my card and recomend me. What do you guys think?
&gt;Thanks again.

Shannon,
The reason the chop shops/discount shops are less is because they are using a cheaper product on the nails. They use MMA, which in most states is banned from use in nail products.
If you start your prices out low, you will have a very hard time raising them. You will feel guilty and some of your clients will complain. Rarely do they see that we need a cost of living raise, as they get in their checks.
You need to set yourself apart from ALL the shops.
*make sure you sanitize correctly ALL implements. NEVER use a half-jar. ALWAYS completely submerse your metal implements.
*NEVER use the same file from client to client. Use washable &amp; sanitizable files if allowed in your state.
*Go ABOVE and BEYOND with your sanitation. That is something that ALL those chop shops lack.
*Be sure to wash with soap and water all your implements before sanitizing.
*Change your towels after every client and clean that table.
*Have your clients wash their hands BEFORE you work on them.
*Wash YOUR hands between every client.
*Tell the client what you are doing to them. Why you use the products you do.
*Keep up with your education. You never will know enough.

My prices are higher than the salons in my immediate area. The Asian shops have a la carte pricing. By the time the client is done, they are paying more to go to them than me and their nails look like
$#!t. I can pick off those nails a mile away.
Strive to have your nails look good at all times.
Okay, I will shut up......
buenos dias,
Lynnette

Hey Sylvia:  I have checked the salons in the area.  They are ALL Asian Shops!  I will be the FIRST english speaking american nail tech for 20 miles radius (sweet, eh??).  All their prices are cheap.  So, should my prices be between their shops and an experienced american/english tech?

Oh, then definitely not!! Don't worry about what the cheap shops are
charging.  You won't be able to sustain the use of quality products at those
prices.  You're in a fantastic position, today's consumers are looking for
techs with knowledge and communication skills and they are williing to pay
more for it.  Google spas or salons outside of your 20 mile radius that
provide the SAME level of service you plan to offer and see what their
prices are like.  There are probably a whole lot of people in your area
driving to those salons who will be thrilled to have someone like you close
by.  GOOD LUCK!!

&gt;Hi Beth,

&gt;Congratulations, and welcome! The best way is to check around and see what
&gt;the other salons in your area are charging and set your prices accordingly
&gt;-
&gt;maybe a couple of dollars less, but NOT much more than that. Its hard
&gt;being new and the only tech in a salon. Go to tradeshows and networking
&gt;events and there are highly experienced techs in this group that are
&gt;willing
&gt;to help you with product information and application skills. Stay confident
&gt;and you'll be fine!

&gt; &gt;Hi Everyone!!

&gt; &gt; I graduated school on August 30th! I landed a job in a brand new hair
&gt; &gt;salon with me as their only tech! I have had a couple weeks experience
&gt; &gt;with another salon that does not have hardly any walk ins. Question: I
&gt; &gt;have to make up a menu. I have only done ONE set of acrylics on a human.
&gt; &gt;TWO sets of gels (in school) and ONE set of silks. Now, I am scared to
&gt; &gt;death because the owner of the salon is counting on me for her clients to
&gt; &gt;like the nail part of the salon. I am going to practice on my neighbor
&gt; &gt;today, but I had used Clarite in school, then the one time, Absolute. It
&gt; &gt;hardened so fast....and freaked me out! Visiting a nail supply store
&gt; &gt;yesterday, the girl recommended Brisa for gels, Solar Nail for acrylics.
&gt; &gt;She said these sold the most. Now, I am in a small town in Georgia, near
&gt; &gt;the mountains. However, we are coming into our tourist season, and I am a
&gt; &gt;little cofused on prices and cannot figure out a menu. I looked at the
&gt; &gt;salons around here, and of course, I am
&gt; &gt; the ONLY english-speaking nail tech for 20 miles. This is good, I know,
&gt; &gt;BUT how can I charge for the nails? They don't speak english, I am new!!!

&gt; &gt; Any suggestions!

&gt; &gt; Thanks! Beth.

I say.. and have always said.. it is easier to learn gels if you have
never done acrylics.. than for a seasoned tech to learn gel after using
AC for a long time.  The application is totally different.

And I will also say that I learned AC first.. and did nails with AC for
8 yrs before learning gel.  But, once I learned the gel application, it
improved my AC application 100 times!  --I think anyway!

There is a growing demand for gels..and I personally believe that Brisa
is the easiest to use.  I have tried YN and IBD.. but none of the
others. so, . but I think I would have to say learn one before you
venture off into too many tangents.  Get proficient with one product so
that you can make a living. then add another to your venue.  You won't
be making money if you have issues that cause clients to seek services
elsewhere.

So, that being said.. I kinda would say learn gels first.  Largely
because you will probably have more clients wanting it as opposed to AC.
But, the bottom line is really which product you choose to sell.  And,
mistakes with gel is easier to fix than with AC.  AC is less forgiving..
and gel is MUCH easier to file!

I am proficient with both.. but, I have been doing nails for going on my
14th year. but, I find that I have as many clients wearing AC as gel.
However, keep in mind, that I have found that AC is a little harder to
break than gel.. so I sometimes decide which product I will use on a
client based on what I can determine by initial inspection of their
natural nails when I am about to put on their first set.  If they are
nail biters. then I use AC.  But, overall, I customize each client's
nails to their own specific lifestyle, needs and desires.

Hey Michele:  Thank you for your response!  I will tell you that I am so
confused by all that is out there for us, that I don't know what to do!
I want to start out with good products, and a menu!  I don't have any
money, so the owner  is buying all the supplies to start.  I don't want
to scare her off (would she be scared?), but I want to be (or appear to
be) knowledgeable about which products I want.  Also, do you think that
by starting out with just one kind of enhancement (like just acyrlics or
just gels, etc) would be better?  Then, just offer additional types as I
grow stronger?  Confused, so confused!!!! HELP!!!

One other thing I was thinking of that I forgot to mention is the Light

new ones each season. I'm LOVING these! The clients are loving them as
well. I've used the gel polish with nearly every client since I've been
there. We charge $12 extra for the gel polish and people don't flinch.
It's dry as soon as you get the top coat cured and it lasts and lasts.

any questions about LE, Kahne posts on the Beauty Tech board and 'Liz in

(or only use acrylics) but use and love the LE Colorz.

Yup, it's slow here in Aug and Sept because of school! lol  We have a
pediatrist in town that I send clients to all the time.  He doesn't send me many, but
most of his clients have diabetes on insulin.  Not for me, lol.
