I joined this group for advice and discussion about diabetes from the
UK perspective. Up until recently it has been a BRILLIANT resource and
I thank from the bottom of my heart all those whose advice I have
passed on to my wife (she's the diabetic in our family) and which has
helped her get to work on sorting out her BG levels in particular.

I didn't join this group to start having the Christian message rammed
down my throat ad nauseam but it seems that's the way it's going and
oh my word but it is INTENSELY ANNOYING !! I could killfile the
blessed Andrew B. Chung, MD/PhD (and indeed it would give me ENORMOUS
pleasure) but I much prefer to read newsgroups in Digest form so
that's not an option.

To the &quot;old&quot; regulars - it's been a real joy to have spent some months
in your company but we'll be off now, and we'll try to get on as best
we can without your continuing and always sensible advice :(

(And at least we won't have to read any more column-feet of items
about aspartame etc - ahhh, there IS perhaps a slightly bright side to
this decision after all :)

My best wishes for your own continued successes.

Uh, John... You seem to have missed the poiint of this group, at least
partly. It is not about that person you mentioned, or about his
&quot;message&quot;. He is a troll, of the sort that is all over usenet.

I strongly recommend that you get a newsreader and learn how to use
filters, so that you do not have to even be disturbed by annoying
posts.

I sincerely hope you stay with us...

Before you hop away, have you tried alt.support.diabetes. Yes, we have
the horrible Chung on board. I don't find Digest form any easier to cope
with. I simply avoid most posts. You soon get to know those with
something really helpful to say.

I am really sorry to hear this John. Chung and his band of repliers have won
again :(  Chung I can killfile, no problem but the damned idiots who reply
to him without taking the diabetes groups out of the cross postings make my
blood boil. People need groups like this and I have never seen so many
selfish people who repeatedly refuse to cut the cross postings out when they
reply to the moron doctor.

Why on earth don't you killfile them? And if you can't -
then make the changes to your news supplier or download the
appropriate software so you can.

Trolls, kooks and twits are a fact of life on usenet. You
learn to work through and around them because it is worth
it.

If you don't feel it's worth it - fine. But I'm getting a
little tired of those who complain about it when solutions
are possible. Complaints like these will never stop chung,
murray and the other crap.

Your loss.

If he was willing to do that there would be no reason for him to leave.
The trouble with asd is the flame feast every Troll gathers in there wake.
You also have the dingbats such as tom (whatever name he is using now) and
% who also get as much flaming.
Also the folks who fight spam by re-posting it in full is unbelievable.
The  spam reapers that operate on that group also make it quite an

To my way of thinking, those who re-post the spam in the process of
&quot;fighting it&quot; are really aiding and abetting the spammer..... and in
some cases, I suspect they *are* the spammer posting an abusive
response to himself, so as to create an opportunity to re-post the BS.
I thnk most spammers just have a case of &quot;bad brains&quot;, or some sort of
psychiatric disorder.

I agree with you about the crap and it has somewhat spoiled what was
once a good, clean newsgroup - news.individual.net removed the MI5
messages but that god-soaked jeebus-freak Chunder is still around - as
for the aspartame-obsessive, I just ignore him.

I have no intention of leaving, even though I have to use Google at
work and see all the shit.

I have tried other fora and newsgroups, but they are either poorly
subscribed or cliquey.  What I would dearly like is a forum inhabited
by diabetes professionals - not to say that the knowledgeable amateurs
are not useful, far from it, but it would be nice to get some feedback
from the coalface of diabetes care.

Hi Erica,

I used to wonder  why &quot;diabetes professionals&quot; are not in such fora
and newsgroups. Then, it hit me... There's no money in it for them, if
they take the time and give away their advice and suggestions. Plus,
they are probably sick of talking diabetes all day in their regular
professional employment, and diabetes is the last thing that they want
to talk about in their free time. The day may come, if it is not
already here somewhere, when there will be pay websites offering
information and interaction with experts in diabetes management and
other diseases.

Will, T2

The way to do that is to do a little wandering on the web.
So I did. Over time I have participated in eight Yahoo
diabetes groups, several usenet diabetes groups, two boards
on the ADA forum, Yahoo &quot;answers&quot;, the Bernstein group, and
several others.

Of course I also discuss anything I have doubts about with
my own doctors.

I have no hesitation in saying I learnt more valuable,
practical and useful information about managing my own
diabetes on usenet, specifically misc.health.diabetes,
alt.support.diabetes and later alt.support.diabetes.uk than
from any other source.

There is a good doctor occasionally dropping in on mhd, Dr
Biggs, but he hasn't been lately. If you really need a
doctor for reassurance there is an endo who runs one of the
better Yahoo groups at
http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/diabetesworld/

You will also find some names you know there, apart from me,
including Jennifer, Derek Paice, Gretchen Becker and several
others. And we argue just as much there too.

To see how discouraging the views from the Medical coalface
can be - read the &quot;Rapid Responses&quot; by the doctors to this
BMJ article and compare them to the ones by the patients:
http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/bmj.39247.447431.BEv1

Nowadays I've less time - so I now &quot;lurk&quot; on the Bernstein
Board and restrict myself to three Yahoo groups, four usenet
groups and the ADA forum:-)

Cheers, Alan, T2, Australia.
