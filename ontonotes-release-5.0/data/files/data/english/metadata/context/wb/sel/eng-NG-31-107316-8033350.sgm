*Pemex looks for more efficiency
*Official wants to cut dependency on Cantarell field

*By THOMAS BLACK
*Bloomberg News

Petr√≥leos Mexicanos, the third-biggest oil supplier to the U.S., must
improve its operating capabilities and expand into new production areas,
such as deepwater, to curb its dependence on the Cantarell oil field, said
the company's head of production and exploration.

&quot;Cantarell has made us highly dependent,&quot; said Pemex's Carlos Morales during
a conference last week in the Gulf of Mexico port city of Veracruz. &quot;The
solutions we're going to face in the future are much smaller fields that
require much more work and efficiency than we have today.&quot;

Pemex now must learn to handle the higher risks of producing oil in Gulf of
Mexico waters more than 1,640 feet deep and tapping thousands of pockets of
oil in the rugged terrain of southeastern Mexico known as Chicontepec as
Cantarell declines at a rate of more than 15 percent this year, Morales
said.

Cantarell, the world's third-largest oil field, caused Mexico's oil industry
to boom when it first began pumping in 1979. The offshore field also caused
complacency, Morales said.

With Cantarell, Pemex's daily production tripled almost overnight to
2.5million barrels during the 1980s from 750,000 barrels per day in
the
previous 10 years. Mexico virtually stopped searching for new oil to replace
Cantarell's reserves during the two decades after the field's production
began.

Since 2000, Pemex has almost tripled spending on exploration to $12.8
billion this year, though it's unable to stem a decline in oil production.

Last week, Pemex Chief Executive Jesus Reyes Heroles said Pemex's goal was
to maintain average crude oil production at an average of 3.1 million
barrels per day from 2007 until 2012. Last year, Pemex produced 3.26 million
barrels per day and had a peak output of 3.38 million barrels in 2004.

Cantarell output fell 12 percent in 2006 and is forecast to decline 15
percent this year. For the first five months of the year, the field has
produced 17 percent less than the same period in 2006. The wells in
Cantarell are in waters that average 197 feet deep.

It's not clear whether Pemex has the capabilities to produce successfully in
deep waters and Chicontepec, which contains fractured oil deposits that
require advanced drilling techniques, said David Shields, an independent
energy analyst based in Mexico City. Mexican law doesn't allow Pemex to form
partnerships with foreign oil companies to gain the technology and
risk-sharing it needs, Shields said.

Pemex's decisions are often made by the Mexican president and the Finance
Ministry, which controls Pemex's budget, and not by oil executives, he said.

&quot;They have their hands tied,&quot; Shields said at the Veracruz conference. &quot;I
see Pemex as something that's not moving forward.&quot;

Yup....Pemex did something bad. Must be Hubberts peak and we're all gonna
die.

On a related topic, did anyone notice that Japan has imported less crude for
like the 3rd straight year? And gee....has an economy which continues to
grow and make nice cars for us Americans? Yup...less oil, economic growth
and more exports....I guess we're still all gonna die EXCEPT the Japanese
because they are just smarter than the rest of us.

Haha...I thought this is a Peak Oil debunked group! :)
It's not end of the world if there are costlier oil but just
inconvenient for cities
to import food and goods and sustainability of the transportation...if
conservation
by demand destruction...(too costly) does not curb oil
consumptions...then
conversion to alternative might be considered the most happening or
hip!

Life will be affected, business might fail...but life still goes on.
it's not end of the world.

The problem is many people will be hit by economic down turn and might
not
be able to accept a sudden hike in prices everywhere.

Do remember that when recession comes...it's starving time.

We have to solve the problem of water and food production in mega
cities
If we don't solve this problems, huge population will migrate into
YOUR cities
to fight for food, water, and jobs.

Life won't be the same anymore!

Let me venture this then. I went looking for the 3 year reference, and
couldn't find it because I was wrong. In 2005 Japan imported some 1% more
than the year before, so there is no way their imports could have been down,
year over year, for 3 years. But....

They used nearly 1% less in imported oil in 2006...

http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/IB21Dh01.html

and had decreased 10 months in a row by here....

http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6384158/Japan-s-crude-oil-imp...

and are at 13 months in a row here....

http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/410905

and somehow they managed to do all of this while growing their economy in
the middle of all of this at the fastest rate in 3 years....

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3985364c-bc98-11db-9cbc-0000779e2340.html

and kept right on doing it into 2007......

http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/17/business/japanecon.php

So....my original amazement, even if I used the wrong time measure for the
country using less oil, still stands. How do you grow your economy while
using less oil?

Not being an economic guru, I am quite amazed to find such a shining example
of how the basic tenents of Doom ( no growth with declining crude supplies )
could be so easily negated with nothing more than whatever it is the
Japanese happen to be doing NOW. Which I'm pretty certain has nothing to do
with little green aliens beaming energy down from Mars, or the fed Chair
personally riding an electricity generating bicycle during lunchtime and
piping the energy to Toyko, etc etc.

&gt;On usenet.

Seeing as how db is being obstinate in providing the actual link to the
article in question ( perhaps cutting and pasting links is difficult for
such an economic genius ) here it is...

http://www.energybulletin.net/31076.html

For starters, we need to understand the technical credentials of such a
masterful piece of concise and undoubtedly accurate technical conclusions.
Eugene Linden has written other critically acclaimed works such as &quot;The
Octopus and the Orangutan: New Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and
Ingenuity&quot; ¬†and &quot;The Parrot's Lament and Other True Tales of Animal
Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity&quot;.

While I'm certain the parrots and octopus were thrilled to see their name in
print, amazingly, I couldn't find a single degree in geology, economics, oil
and gas related engineering or anything else which might lead the reader to
believe that the author had qualifications in any particular area beyond a
general slant towards &quot;tree huggery&quot;. Looking at his publishing history, I'm
sure I've bumped into works of the author in Time or National Geo, and it is
not a surprise that quite a few of his articles sure sound like a person
trying to save the planet, one article at a time. While this slant, which is
commendable, would hardly lead to a balanced and fair shake for the villians
who brought you modern civilization, otherwise known as oil and gas
companies ( &quot;Big Oil&quot; to the conspiracy fans at the lower end of the primate
scale ).

So lets wander through his wonderfully titled piece and see what a high
recommendation from the venerable db gets one nowadays, shall we?

Paragraph 3. We have perhaps already achieved Peak! EEK! Several years ago
as a matter of fact. And the devastating consequences to the Japanese as
they use less oil has been??? Thats right...economic growth. AMAZ-ZA-ZING!!
And the rest of the world? Besides higher gas prices, which aren't even
&quot;real&quot; highs, the US keeps chugging along as well, although I believe I am
on record as thinking we should have been in a recession by now. But then, I
don't claim economic foresight, or even that Eugene knows oil from natural
gas, he's db's &quot;expert&quot; citation.

Paragraph 4 is the good one! What happens after Peak happened 2 years ago?
Why everything! And I quote...

&quot;With nothing to fill the gap, global economic growth would slow, stop, and
then reverse; international tensions would soar as nations seek access to
diminishing supplies, enriching autocratic rulers in unstable oil states;
and, unless other sources of energy could be ramped up with extreme haste,
the world could plunge into a new Dark Age. Even as faltering economies
burned less oil, carbon loading of the atmosphere might accelerate as
countries turn to vastly dirtier coal.&quot;

Tensions! Dark Age! Carbon loading! Faltering economies! Lions and Tigers
and Bears!

And what have we actually seen, in these 2 post peak years? Well....I'm
guessing that the only one who might think its a new Dark Age is Osama,
hiding in his hole somewhere.

I would think during journalist school they would at least ASK that you
stick your head out the window when speculating on Peak oil, 2 years after
the fact, and look around before assuming that cars had stopped running, men
were using spears and in general the world had ground to a halt. Otherwise
pesky stuff like REALITY might get brought into the arguement, and what fun
would that be without citations and references and everything db could ask
for! Can't have reality interfering with cool Doomer arm waving, now can we?

And what wonderful suggestions is such a distinquished author suggesting?
Why oil taxes of course! ( anyone want to bet if this guy drives a Prius,
rides a bike, takes mass transit, etc etc? ) Taxes are the tree huggers way
of forcing people toward their side of the silly-solution pile. Oh no....we
can't produce more...there obviously is no more! All we can hope to do...is
to make everyone like me!!

I like the title as well, make sure to get that &quot;Dark Age&quot; scare mongering
in. I suppose its too much to ask a distinquished non knowledgable expert
journalist to do any particular analysis on what peak production means,
other means of forming the same product and the supplies available to do
that with, the costs associated with such conversions, growth in reserves
through time being the biggest discovery of &quot;new&quot; oil on the planet, the
concept of V2G and the electrification of transport in the US, and on...and
on. When one has a hammer, every problem looks like a nail I guess.

Got anyone with at least some industry experience there db, or you just want
to cite guys and cheesecake pieces like this as an actual &quot;reference&quot;? By
the way, the only way I'd use this as a reference professionally is as a
joke. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you try it yourself and the
reviewers laugh at you, wouldn't want that to happen to our local economics
guru. Self esteem and all....gotta be politically correct nowadays...

Your 2005-2006 number was wrong, you decided to calculate a 2004-2006

Obviously from the information I provided, Japanese consumption of imported
crude was down 0.8% between 2005 and 2006....if they decided to make up any
extra energy requirments in other forms and fashions this is EXACTLY how the
rest of the world will have to get along in a post peak environment, isn't
it? And as I stated before, the Japanese appear to be on the path to
figuring it out, economic growth with less crude.

I realize you aren't happy with an example which relates to how one of the
largest economies in the world continues to grow while using less imported
crude...myself, I figure its worth paying attention to as a harbringer of
things to come globally.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;??? You keep trying to change the point to the 'size' of Japan's

I am not referencing a pissant example of less crude useage with economic
growth for a reason. I am referencing one of the worlds largest economies
doing what the Doomers say can't be done. Size does matter in this case,
otherwise Doomers would pretend its just a blip on the radar. When its one
of the largest economies in the world, thats some blip, nicht wahr?

Excellent! Lots of modelling stuff....and when I searched for the words
&quot;crude&quot; or &quot;oil&quot; guess what? Turns out the words aren't even in the
document! How clever, using something with no bearing whatsoever on the
conversation at hand! I must use such a excellent distraction myself
someday, when someone posts a question on say....bicycle tire consumption in
the US, I'll whip out a nice economic analysis which has nothing to do with
bicycle tires!

Just out of curiousity, did you seriously find something in there which
means anything to A) debunking peak oil B) verifying economic consequences
of peak oil C) refuting the original point of economic growth while using
less oil imports?

To answer the question though, the Great And Wise Monte has sited 2 years
ago as peak light conventional liquids, and 1 year ago as peak everything,
and of course the hobbyists over at TOD seem to agree with him, so I'm more
than happy using their numbers until....well...it turns out they are wrong.
I mean seriously, keep guessing at this long enough, and sooner or later
someone is going to be right.

So, if I send you a phase behavior textbook which us petroleum engineers
find wildly interesting but which has nothing to do with global oil
production issues, that somehow is supposed to explain peak oil to a noob?
Good one....

While I rarely assume people are clueless, I do expect people to try and
carry on about their particular topic of interest in a manner which allows
even noob's to have a chance at understanding. People putting on airs are
usually over compensating for something directly related to the topic at
hand. Just an observation....
