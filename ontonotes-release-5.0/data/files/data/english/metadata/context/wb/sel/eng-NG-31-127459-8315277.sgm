Hello; I am retired so I spend some time studying any culture or
part of our world society. When I do not know enough about the
discussion, I keep my mouth shut and learn. I have f
ollowed this group for many months. I enjoy all of the debates. I see
that I am considered a &quot;lurker&quot;, which sounds rather derogatory to me.
That is not my  intention.
My reason for this note is the health of Rabbi  Wolpe. I am a fan
of his. I have listened to many of his statements on history, Judaism
and the meanings of the 5 books of Moses and the Torah. He has not
looked well for many months.I would like to send my best wishes and
hope for a speedy and complete recovery,
If anyone knows Rabbi David Wolpe (assistant to the chancelor);
please relay my concern for his health and my admiration for him as a
man.
Pardon my interruption.

You are welcome to lurk here. I myself lurked for several years before
posting my first posting. Lurk is not a deragatory word. It is the
Usenet standard jargon for someone who reads the postings in a
newsgroup without posting him/herself.

I do not know Rabbi Wolpe, but if you can inform me of his Jewish name
and his mother's Jewish name, I will pray for him. You say his is
assistannt to the chancelor. Chancelor of what, if I may inquire, not
that it matters to my prayers.

You may well be friendly, and you may be old. But why do you call
yourself a dog?

It is an excellent way to udnerstand the group dynamics,
and how best to behave in a group.

Nothing &quot;derogatory&quot; at all. It's just what someone who just follows
a usenet group with personally participating is called.

Could you give us some more identifying signs for this rabbi? Like
where he is and what he does. That may help.

No need to ask for pardon, on-topic posts are always welcome.

Good day to you. The 'old dog' is my reaction to the (you can't
teach an old dog new tricks),I believe this to be wrong so it offends
me.
I really don't know any personal information about rabbi Wolpe. I
know him as a tv celebrity on the History channel. He is associated
with a major Jewish organization with campuses in NY and LA. I
apologize for my memory lapse.
I am also changing my nickname to Bob.
