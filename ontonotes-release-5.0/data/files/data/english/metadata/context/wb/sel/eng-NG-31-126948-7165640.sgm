Journeys of Service and Understanding to the Middle East

Middle East Fellowship and Holy Land Trust are proud to announce six
upcoming opportunities to journey to the Middle East on pilgrimages of
service and understanding. Our journeys to the Middle East are open to
all and will appeal to a wide range of interests and life callings.

Would you like to help us rebuild a home that was demolished to help
bring hope and healing to a Palestinian family? Then you may be
interested in our 1st Annual Home Rebuilding Camp in July. Interested
in exploring the culture and history of Syria, studying Arabic and
serving Syria's ever-growing population of Iraqi refugees (among other
volunteer opportunities)? Then you may want to consider joining us for
the Damascus Summer Encounter program this June. Are you interested in
volunteering, studying Arabic and living with a host family in
Palestine? Our Palestine Summer Encounter program offers an
unparalleled opportunity to do exactly that with 40 participating
Palestinian NGOs and institutions offering volunteer placements.

Now more than ever it is important to meet with the peoples of the
Middle East face-to-face in the spirit of dialogue and understanding.
We hope that you will consider joining us this year in Palestine and
Israel or Damascus.

Sincerely,

Elias Ghareeb

Journey of the Magi 2007
September 17th-December 25th 2007

- A once in a lifetime opportunity to journey across the Middle East
- Honor Christ's birth by following the footsteps of the Magi (wise
men)
- Muslims and Christians working together to create a 'Pilgrimage of
Peace'
- Meet with community and religious leaders throughout the Middle East
- Participate for 10 days or up to 3 months!

In the year 2000 Christians from all over the world gathered in the
Middle East to recreate the Journey of the Magi (or "the wise men") to
honor the birth of the Prince of Peace. On foot and on camel the
pilgrims traveled over 1,000 miles through Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel
and the Palestinian Territories. Along the way the journey members met
with local religious and community leaders. The story was widely
covered by newspapers, radio and TV stations in the United States,
Europe and throughout the Middle East.

The journey is a shared project between Christians and Muslims to
honor Jesus. Muslims venerate Jesus (`Īsā) as a prophet and Christians
venerate him as the Messiah. We hope that the journey can help
demonstrate that there are shared values among the peoples of the book
and that peace and mutual understanding is possible in the Middle East
and throughout the world.

In 2007, participants from all over the world will again reenact the
Journey of the Magi. We invite you to join us for this once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity to honor Jesus, the Prince of Peace.
