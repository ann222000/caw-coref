In 1945 there were some 170 Baltic fugitives in Sweden, who were
claimed by Russia (the Soviet Union under Stalin) to be punished by
Soviet justice. One of them was Edvard Alsknis. When it was announced
to him that he would be delivered to the Soviet Union by the Swedish
government, (who rather bent their backs in kowtow to Russia than
respected the human rights of political fugitives who had appealed for
help,)he started on a hunger strike. After 22 days he gave it up,
saying, &quot;It makes no difference anyway.&quot; But that night he used all his
force to drive a pen into his eye, a well sharpened lead pen, which was
exactly 15 centimeters long, that is about 6 inches. He immediately
lost consciousness after a sharp pain, but the pen was there, right
into his brain, 15 centimeters long, and he had used such desperate
force, that only a short end stood out of it. The case is perfectly
documented. It was in the night of December 14th 1945 in a refugee camp
close to Halmstad.

The point is that he survived. His only disability afterwards was a
partial paralysis on his side, apart, of course, from blindness on the
afflicted eye. He was not given over to the Soviet justice but later
spent his days in England. He lived to a surprisingly old age.

The parallel with the Marlowe case is obvious. The experts were
generally unanimous that Marlowe could not have died of that wound
which was so carefully measured by Coroner Danby. The pen that went
into the brains of Edvard Alsknis was 15 centimeters long, and more
than half of it went in. The wound that killed Marlowe, according to
the Queen's own expert coroner Danby, was no more than two inches deep,
that's about 5 centimeters, of which, according to Danby, &quot;the
aforesaid Christopher Marlowe then and there instantly died.&quot;

My only point was to present this case as supporting circumstantial
evidence that the whole &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;investigation by the Queen's own
Expert Coroner&quot; (whom no one could call in question) was a set-up to
save Marlowe for continued activity.

If the idea was to pretend that Marlowe was dead, but
have a different, and dead, body examined, then the
wound to the dead body would be very relevant. It
would have to have arisen from circumstances which
could be legitimately claimed as self-defence, possibly
render the face less recognizable, and in a position
which could be shown to the jury without revealing
any true causes of death.

Silly parallel (that's been brought up before). Whether a wound to the
brain kills depends entirely on its location in a particular person's
head, the anatomy of each being unique). It is clear that the location
of the wound in the Marlowe case was in the right place to kill him.
There is no unanimity of expert opinion that his wound could not have
killed him, only the ill-founded opinions of a few dolts out to make a
splash.

Yes, I agree. However, the point Christian was making was that the
wound would not have been lethal, and Marlowe could have survived. But
the body being examined - with that wound upon it - was, in fact, a
dead body. In that wise, then the information Christian presented
regarding the possibility that the wound could have been nonlethal is
irrelevant. If someone else was killed, and the body made to represent
Marlowe, then Marlowe wasn't wounded at all.

It would be interesting to look at many such eye-knife injuries and see
under what conditions they were fatal or not. Don't know if coroners
would be open to sharing their information for 'Christopher Marlowe
research'.

I just did a random search on google, and found a reference to a
journal article from a medical publication on trauma that apparently
described the surgery and treatment of someone who had had a
screwdriver accident(?) with the eye. (Unfortunately, one has to pay
quite a bit to actually see the article, but maybe it's in a medical
library.)

Recall also the case of the young woman who died after the Boston Red
Sox (baseball) World Series win after too much tear gas got into an
eye(?). Now, that was a reaction to a chemical substance rather than to
a physical object, so there's likely a big difference, yet it was
surprising that something so apparently minor killed her.

Also found a link describing some violence-related injuries that
occurred during part of the Middle Ages; perhaps there is similar
information to be found for the Renaissance. Not very cheerful reading,
but it does add some realism to what we know as the Middle Ages:

Then what was your post about?!? The body on the slab had a wound. It
was a dead body. So maybe the wound would have frequently been
nonlethal. In this case it was lethal. Sucks for the dead guy, but
what's the point? If Marlowe was not on the slab, he didn't receive
the wound, so what does it matter whether the wound is frequently fatal
or not?? How is there any parallel at all with the
Marlowe-Didn't-Die-In-Deptford theory?

Because if it were the case that nearly all such wounds were
non-lethal, the inquest would stand a chance of being invalid--in other
words, Friser and company just didn't know enough about medicine to
make up a convincing story. That could imply that the whole thing had
been faked, and that perhaps Marlowe didn't die in Deptford.

Now, of course, you can't prove that all such wounds are non-lethal,
but if you could prove it significantly, it would certainly give weight
to that theory. In other words, if you investigated 2000 such cases,
and none resulted in death, instant death in particular, it might look
like the inquest was invalid.

The inquest that is on-going? The corpse must not have been dead. If
it was, Marlowe came back to life, along with Oxenford, Bacon, and
Stratman, who'se grave is empty, too. The immortality of the bard(s)
is probably what Mark Twain was referring to in his title, Is
Shakespeare Dead?

Responding to lariadc, the body...on the slab...was dead. Whether or
not it was Marlowe, it was dead. The fact that it died from a wound
that is commonly non-fatal (if indeed that is the case), is totally
irrelavent. It does not make the inquest look invalid. What does that
mean, anyway? The guy was dead with a knife wound to his face. Friser
had to make up a story (if in fact he needed to make up a story) to
explain WHY he killed Marlowe. He didn't need to make up a story about
the wound - the coroner was staring at it!

I should say that I do believe in the validity of documents such as
inquests in general, and I think that a surviving Marlowe is extremely
unlikely, but because we have decent evidence that he was a spy (and
spies sometimes fake their deaths?--don't have a good answer to that
one either, but I'll assume it for now), we have to consider it. Now, I
haven't thought this through as much as others have, but I'll give some
initial ideas.

(And also, even if Marlowe survived, it doesn't mean he worked with
Shakespeare later, but of course everyone will ask that question if
Marlowe's tracks are ever found.)

If it occurred, I wasn't thinking that the corpse was still alive,
Frankenstein and Mark Twain notwithstanding, but was someone other than
Marlowe. (See Peter Farey's pages...) If that were so, the wound on the
person other than Marlowe was probably artificially inflicted, perhaps
to hide the facial identity of the corpse. Perhaps Danby had access or
knew someone who had access to a morgue and was able to obtain a body.
Penry is also mentioned as a possibility.

But, assuming that this scenario occurred, Frizer(Friser--I guess there
are variant spellings) wanted to make it look as though he had really
killed someone, so he told the story about the wound and the instant
death, not realizing that such a wound would be extremely unlikely to
really kill anyone. (That of course has to be researched, as previously
mentioned, and might be totally false--but has anyone done such
research?)

He did need to tell some kind of story about the wound because he was
asked about the details of how the death occurred, and he needed to
make it look like it was done in self-defense, so that his upcoming
pardon would seem reasonable, and his good name would remain intact.

I have some questions myself (for Peter Farey, perhaps)--why was his
(Frizer's) dagger given as the murder weapon instead of using
Marlowe's, if that was what happened? Wouldn't using Marlowe's weapon
have given Frizer a better argument of self-defense?

It was the responsibility of the jury to look for any signs
of violence. Now, just suppose (as I happen to think) the
corpse was really that of a man who had been hanged, rather
than stabbed. Do you not think that they might have wondered
about those contusions around his neck? Better to arrange
matters so that they didn't see that bit, but simply had
the wound to the eye shown to them. See my essay &quot;Marlowe's
Sudden and Fearful End&quot; for the way I think it was set up.

I don't think you need to. I don't believe he was responsible

It is for this reason, I believe, that biographers have been
reluctant to consider this even as only a possibility. I do have
hopes, however, that Park Honan's forthcoming biography will
at least address this issue, even if he thinks it unlikely.

No such thing as morgues in those days, as far as I know, but

the body of an executed prisoner, I am fairly sure that it
could have been arranged.

Yes. I believe that opinions are divided. For me, it is not
of great importance. The witnesses had to tell a story that
would sound plausible to the jury, and they succeeded. It
is only if it were totally impossible for someone to have
died in that way that it becomes important, and I doubt
very much that this is the case.

I can only guess, the same as you. According to the story,
Marlowe himself was probably still holding the dagger at the
time of the stabbing, whereas Frizer was (now) completely
unarmed. That might have been thought important?

Dear friend,

This most intriguing subject reminds me of Dorothy Sayers' first
thriller, &quot;Whose body?&quot;, about a corpse found in a bath tub. No one
claimed any responsibility, and it wasn't easy to establish the
identity of that strange corpse. It was perhaps even her best novel.

I am also reminded of a curious parallel case. On that day in Hasting
1066 Harold Godwinson defending his country against a most foul and
wicked intruder had an arrow shot into his eye. Official history says
he died. However, his corpse was never produced and never found - he
never got a burial, not even in any unknown anonymous graveyard. One
can't help suspecting that his loyal Englishmen spirited away his
corpse, if it really was a corpse, and that he might even have
survived, perhaps to continue clandestinely in some obscure monastery -
any kind of life would have been better than under William the
Conqueror, who by force stole a country that wasn't his.

What surprises me concerning William Danby's report is that apparently
no one suspected anything fishy about the report for 30 years, between
1925 until 1955, although any criminologist immediately would have an
alarm bell ringing in his head at the sight of this most remarkable and
so obviously cooked investigation.

I hope this thread conversation and discussion will continue for a
while, since there is much to say about this, perhaps in the shadow of
these atrocious cross postings going on disturbing, interrupting and
sabotaging what really should be the only thing discussed in HLAS.

hopefully to be continued,

John Bede

On the contrary, it was attacked almost immediately, by

This is not true, I now realize, as I report the views of
some people who came to the conclusion that Marlowe's death
must have been faked *because* they believed that he wrote
the works of Shakespeare. I reject that argument, and claim
that the reasons for believing his death to be faked are
sufficient by themselves for this possible scenario to be
taken seriously, regardless of whether or not he ever wrote
another word.

There are three possibilities. Either the author wrote alone, or he
worked with someone, or he worked with several. I think the confusion
in this case points to the fact that he probably worked with several. I
am inclined to include Bacon, Marlowe, Shakespeare (that is, as the
Baconians call him, 'Shakspere',) and William Stanley as the centre of
the league. Now, the 'Shakespeare style' does probably not come from
Shakspere, and since it is unique it probably comes from only one of
them all. Stanley was probably peripherical, like Oxford perhaps
contributing with some basic comedy plots. Whose is the style then?
Bacon's or Marlowe's? That is the question. I don't think the Stratford
monument offers any clue to that question but rather adds to the
confusion, as if its purpose was to increase the mystification, as if
the real 'Shakespeare' would have thought that to be a fun idea.

The Baines Note probably arrived far too late to have had

The verb is transitive. Therefore the correct grammatical

can read *who it is*, and not whether you have the ability
to read in general, as it would be if intransitive. So why
might it be harder to read *that bit* in particular?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anything can be given double meanings.

Indeed it can:

Stay Passenger, why goest thou by so fast?
read (1) if thou canst, whom envious Death hath plast
with (2), in this monument, Shakspeare: with whome
quick (3) nature dide: Christ- (4)
ofer Marley: he is returned withal (5): that He (6)
hath writt,
Leaves living art but page to serve his witt.

1. 'Solve' or 'work out' *whom*, rather than just
'read' the words, as one might think.
2. 'With' as a separate word, rather than as part of
the word 'within', as one might think.
3. 'Quick' as the opposite of dead (as Marlowe was
supposed to have been), rather than 'bursting
with life', as one might think.
4. The owner of the name decking the 'Tombe' (ie
the grave, rather than the monument, as one might
think). The word 'Christ' then leads logically to
the rest of the name one's been told to work out.
5. 'Sieh' is not the misprint one might think, but
a rebus - 'he is' returned (with 'all').
6. 'He' must now be the person just identified, rather
than 'Shakspeare' as one might think. If so the
meaning of the last line has to reflect this:
'art' (Marlowe) is left still living, sans page
(Shakespeare) to serve (up) his wit.

But, as you said, anything can be given double meanings,

What mystification? As my opponents have constantly

&gt;&gt; alone, or he worked with someone, or he worked with several.
&gt;&gt; I think the confusion in this case points to the fact that
&gt;&gt; he probably worked with several.

&gt; I'm afraid I don't share your confusion.

"/>

The confusion I mean is the general confusion resulting in Oxfordians,
Baconians, Marlovians, Stratfordians, Derbyites and what not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I am inclined to include Bacon, Marlowe, Shakespeare (that is,
&gt;&gt; as the Baconians call him, 'Shakspere',) and William Stanley
&gt;&gt; as the centre of the league. Now, the 'Shakespeare style'
&gt;&gt; does probably not come from Shakspere, and since it is unique
&gt;&gt; it probably comes from only one of them all. Stanley was
&gt;&gt; probably peripherical, like Oxford perhaps contributing with
&gt;&gt; some basic comedy plots. Whose is the style then? Bacon's or
&gt;&gt; Marlowe's? That is the question.

&gt; No contest.

"/>

I will try to put it clearer. The question is whether Marlowe wrote
Shakespeare or whether Bacon (or someone else) wrote Marlowe and
Shakespeare or whether someone else wrote Marlowe and Shakespeare alone
or with others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I don't think the Stratford monument offers any clue to
&gt;&gt; that question but rather adds to the confusion, as if its
&gt;&gt; purpose was to increase the mystification, as if the real
&gt;&gt; 'Shakespeare' would have thought that to be a fun idea.

&gt; What mystification? As my opponents have constantly
&gt; reminded me, most readers of the words on the monument
&gt; have happily accepted that, although not great poetry, it
&gt; is simply saying what a great playwright he was, and
&gt; after that they haven't given it another thought.

"/>

I admit there could be more to it than what it says. I will go there
and scrutinize what it really says. Perhaps it says something entirely
different from another point of view, depending on who interprets it in
what way...

What I mean to say is you can't approach or analyze a poet
scientifically, since poetry is of an entirely alien or even opposite
mentality to science. When you try a scientific apporach to poetry you
must debase it and miss its point, that is, the spirit. If you feel the
spirit of poetry, you can know the person behind it. In any other way
it's impossible to get to it.

Bacon appears to have had a deep understanding of poetry as well as of
science, which perhaps makes him unique and not altogether improbable
as the true Shakespeare, while at the same time it's difficult to
associate him with Marlowe and the sonnets. At the same time it's
difficult to separate Shakespeare and Marlowe. In brief, there are a
few problems that can't be settled by hairsplitting mechanics.

&gt;&gt; I just did a random search on google, and found a reference to a

&gt;&gt; a physical object, so there's likely a big difference, yet it was
&gt;&gt; surprising that something so apparently minor killed her.

&gt;&gt; Also found a link describing some violence-related injuries that
&gt;&gt; occurred during part of the Middle Ages; perhaps there is similar
&gt;&gt; information to be found for the Renaissance. Not very cheerful reading,
&gt;&gt; but it does add some realism to what we know as the Middle Ages:

&gt;&gt; Car-yn L,

&gt; Dear friend,

&gt; This most intriguing subject reminds me of Dorothy Sayers' first
&gt; thriller, &quot;Whose body?&quot;, about a corpse found in a bath tub. No one
&gt; claimed any responsibility, and it wasn't easy to establish the
&gt; identity of that strange corpse. It was perhaps even her best novel.

&gt; I am also reminded of a curious parallel case. On that day in Hasting
&gt; 1066 Harold Godwinson defending his country against a most foul and
&gt; wicked intruder had an arrow shot into his eye. Official history says
&gt; he died. However, his corpse was never produced and never found - he
&gt; never got a burial, not even in any unknown anonymous graveyard. One
&gt; can't help suspecting that his loyal Englishmen spirited away his
&gt; corpse, if it really was a corpse, and that he might even have
&gt; survived, perhaps to continue clandestinely in some obscure monastery -
&gt; any kind of life would have been better than under William the
&gt; Conqueror, who by force stole a country that wasn't his.

"/>

I am looking at the book 1066: The Year of the Conquest by David
Howarth, who is a local historian in Sussex Forest. Howarth mentions a
few chronicles describing the Battle of Hastings, and notes that the
earliest ones do not include the story of the arrow at all, but that
most of the later ones including the Bayeux Tapestry do, one as early
as 1099. He does accept the arrow story as plausible.

According to Howarth (p.182-183), for the most part those later
chronicles suggest that Harold was not killed instantly by the arrow in
his eye, but was consequently killed by William's men, though one
chronicle does say he was killed by the arrow by the time William's men
arrived.

Most of them suggest that he was cut to bits by the enemy, so that
might explain why there was no body, but the eye wound is a good
parallel to Marlowe, although there doesn't seem to be enough
consistent information about it. Now, Howarth wrote a popular rather
than a scholarly book, but it sounds like he has read his sources.

This is deplorable, Peter. This is what I get out of the text, so help

quick nature died: whose name, doth deck ys tombe,

My suggestion to modernized spelling:

Stay, passenger, why goest thy by so fast?
Read, if thou canst, whom envious death hath placed
with in this monument Shakespeare, with whom
quick nature died, whose name doth deck this tombe,
far more, then cost. Say all, this he hath writ,
leaves living art, but page, to serve his wit.

I can't agree further with you than that only the two last lines are
rather unclear, whereas there is nothing to question in the previous
ones. The most logical interpretation of the last two lines I would
suggest as follows:

Far more than what it cost is, so say all, what he has written,
after his living art, leaves us but a page to serve his wit.

The impression which your interpretation gives me is that you have
stumbled into the Baconian trap if making anything out of a document
except what's written in it. Nothing has impeded antistratfordianism
more than this dreadful aberration. Any alteration of a document must
lead any interpretation of it astray. This is elementary. I am sorry,
but I can find no support for any alternative to faithful
stratfordianism in this case. I don'¨t think neither Bacon nor Marlowe
ever went to Stratford.

*Post hoc, ergo propter hoc*? Hardly. The primary complaint

this was known about by the middle of May, and probably
before he appeared before the Privy Council on 20th. It was

One of the members of the privy council was the 4th earl of Derby, the
father of Ferdinando and William. Since both brothers were engaged in
the theatre life and Ferdinando especially (the producer of most of
Marlowe's plays), the Baines note would have been of concern to him. If
I remember correctly, Sir Thomas Walsingham, Marlowe's chief
benefactor, was also connected with the privy council if not a member.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Responding to lariadc, the body...on the slab...was dead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether or not it was Marlowe, it was dead. The fact that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it died from a wound that is commonly non-fatal (if indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is the case), is totally irrelavent. It does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; make the inquest look invalid. What does that mean, anyway?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The guy was dead with a knife wound to his face. Friser
&gt;&gt;&gt; had to make up a story (if in fact he needed to make up a
&gt;&gt;&gt; story) to explain WHY he killed Marlowe. He didn't need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to make up a story about the wound - the coroner was
&gt;&gt;&gt; staring at it!

&gt; It was the responsibility of the jury to look for any signs
&gt; of violence. Now, just suppose (as I happen to think) the
&gt; corpse was really that of a man who had been hanged, rather
&gt; than stabbed. Do you not think that they might have wondered
&gt; about those contusions around his neck? Better to arrange
&gt; matters so that they didn't see that bit, but simply had
&gt; the wound to the eye shown to them. See my essay &quot;Marlowe's
&gt; Sudden and Fearful End&quot; for the way I think it was set up.

&gt;&gt; I should say that I do believe in the validity of documents
&gt;&gt; such as inquests in general, and I think that a surviving
&gt;&gt; Marlowe is extremely unlikely, but because we have decent
&gt;&gt; evidence that he was a spy (and spies sometimes fake their
&gt;&gt; deaths?--don't have a good answer to that one either, but
&gt;&gt; I'll assume it for now),

&gt; I don't think you need to. I don't believe he was responsible
&gt; for whatever happened. It was something that was forced upon
&gt; him by people far more powerful than he was.

"/>

Guess we'll have to read more spy novels and thrillers, as was
suggested, and then compare them to actual cases.

But I think you are suggesting that it would not have worked for
Marlowe to have acted alone in faking his death. I have seen some
difficult questions about the fake-death theory such as &quot;Why couldn't
he have pretended to have died from the plague?&quot;&quot;Why couldn't he have
just left--extradition laws didn't exist at that time&quot;--have not yet
seen any source cited for that fact. I have been thinking that the
powerful people you mention would not have wanted it to look as though
they had let a heretic escape, so perhaps desired to put forth a strong
case that he had died, and perhaps even one that made it look as though
he had been punished for his heresy, which some later thought.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; we have to consider it. Now, I haven't thought this through
&gt;&gt; as much as others have, but I'll give some initial ideas.

&gt;&gt; (And also, even if Marlowe survived, it doesn't mean he
&gt;&gt; worked with Shakespeare later, but of course everyone will
&gt;&gt; ask that question if Marlowe's tracks are ever found.)

&gt; It is for this reason, I believe, that biographers have been
&gt; reluctant to consider this even as only a possibility. I do have
&gt; hopes, however, that Park Honan's forthcoming biography will
&gt; at least address this issue, even if he thinks it unlikely.

"/>

I agree, and I hope he and others do address it in the future too. I
don't think that the fake-death theory is any more implausible than the
assassination theory, yet scholars give that one some credence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If it occurred, I wasn't thinking that the corpse was still
&gt;&gt; alive, Frankenstein and Mark Twain notwithstanding, but was
&gt;&gt; someone other than Marlowe. (See Peter Farey's pages...) If
&gt;&gt; that were so, the wound on the person other than Marlowe
&gt;&gt; was probably artificially inflicted, perhaps to hide the
&gt;&gt; facial identity of the corpse. Perhaps Danby had access or
&gt;&gt; knew someone who had access to a morgue and was able to
&gt;&gt; obtain a body.

&gt; No such thing as morgues in those days, as far as I know, but
&gt; if Danby (and other high-ranking colleagues) wanted to claim
&gt; the body of an executed prisoner, I am fairly sure that it
&gt; could have been arranged.

&gt;&gt; Penry is also mentioned as a possibility.

&gt; First suggested by Dave More, and an excellent suggestion
&gt; it was too in my opinion.

"/>

It is an excellent suggestion because of the closeness of time and
place; yet with that theory, you need to explain how hang marks were
not seen, and it seems to me that it could have been another body just
as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But, assuming that this scenario occurred, Frizer (Friser--
&gt;&gt; I guess there are variant spellings) wanted to make it
&gt;&gt; look as though he had really killed someone, so he told
&gt;&gt; the story about the wound and the instant death, not
&gt;&gt; realizing that such a wound would be extremely unlikely
&gt;&gt; to really kill anyone. (That of course has to be researched,
&gt;&gt; as previously mentioned, and might be totally false--but
&gt;&gt; has anyone done such research?)

&gt; Yes. I believe that opinions are divided. For me, it is not
&gt; of great importance. The witnesses had to tell a story that
&gt; would sound plausible to the jury, and they succeeded. It
&gt; is only if it were totally impossible for someone to have
&gt; died in that way that it becomes important, and I doubt
&gt; very much that this is the case.

"/>

You're probably right, but I would like to learn more about it because
I've only read Nicholl's mention of some arteries near the brain--I
would at least like to see a drawing and a few definite cases of those
who died from such wounds.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; He did need to tell some kind of story about the wound
&gt;&gt; because he was asked about the details of how the death
&gt;&gt; occurred, and he needed to make it look like it was done
&gt;&gt; in self-defense, so that his upcoming pardon would seem
&gt;&gt; reasonable, and his good name would remain intact.

&gt;&gt; I have some questions myself (for Peter Farey, perhaps)
&gt;&gt; --why was his (Frizer's) dagger given as the murder weapon
&gt;&gt; instead of using Marlowe's, if that was what happened?
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't using Marlowe's weapon have given Frizer a better
&gt;&gt; argument of self-defense?

&gt; I can only guess, the same as you. According to the story,
&gt; Marlowe himself was probably still holding the dagger at the
&gt; time of the stabbing, whereas Frizer was (now) completely
&gt; unarmed. That might have been thought important?

"/>

It's a good point that Frizer was unarmed. If Marlowe had used his own
dagger, then Frizer likely would have used his as well; then you would
have Frizer holding a dagger as well, which would look more aggressive.

I must say that the accidental death doesn't really sound too strange
to me, but I do have to imagine that Marlowe was either an
exceptionally angry and hot-tempered person, or else very drunk, in
which case his movements might have been more easily controlled by
others(?)--something else to think about.

This is incorrect. In fact not a single line of it

I invite you to look at the following article, where
the pre-1974 version is illustrated.

An accurate transcript of this (excluding ligatures,
and using upper and lower case instead of different

Precisely. This is why, unlike most commentators (and you),
I insist upon the accurate transcription of the monument,
and reject any changes made simply to fit in with what it
is *assumed* that the meaning must be.

You chose to ignore that part of an earlier post in which
I drew attention to the changes of *meaning* that I was
suggesting for various words. Other than the 'puzzle' bit
in the middle, of course, I gave no alternative for a word
which was not as acceptable - if not more so - than the
one any casual reader was obviously intended to take.

For those who missed it, here it is again:

&lt;quote&gt;

Stay Passenger, why goest thou by so fast?
read (1) if thou canst, whom envious Death hath plast
with (2), in this monument, Shakspeare: with whome
quick (3) nature dide: Christ- (4)
ofer Marley: he is returned withal (5): that He (6)
hath writt,
Leaves living art but page to serve his witt.

1. 'Solve' or 'work out' *whom*, rather than just
'read' the words, as one might think.
2. 'With' as a separate word, rather than as part of
the word 'within', as one might think.
3. 'Quick' as the opposite of dead (as Marlowe was
supposed to have been), rather than 'bursting
with life', as one might think.
4. The owner of the name decking the 'Tombe' (ie
the grave, rather than the monument, as one might
think). The word 'Christ' then leads logically to
the rest of the name one's been told to work out.
5. 'Sieh' is not the misprint one might think, but
a rebus - 'he is' returned (with 'all').
6. 'He' must now be the person just identified, rather
than 'Shakspeare' as one might think. If so the
meaning of the last line has to reflect this:
'art' (Marlowe) is left still living, sans page
(Shakespeare) to serve (up) his wit.

&lt;unquote&gt;

Now, the question is whether such a hidden meaning
was included deliberately. Here is what I argued in
the thread &quot;Why the Monument's 'Riddle' is Valid&quot;.

&lt;quote&gt;

It seems to me that there are several stages one should go
through in determining whether or not the hidden meaning I
stumbled upon really was deliberately included in the monu-
ment's inscription. At each stage, the likelihood of it
being a genuine hidden message increases, finishing up by
being as near to certainty as makes no difference at all.

1) By treating one part of the poem, marked out by two
colons, as a rebus it is possible to discover Christ-
opher Marlowe's complete name, and as he himself spelt
it. This is already further than most suggested hidden
messages ever get.

2) Furthermore, by interpreting a few of the other words in
a different - but equally acceptable - way, it is also
possible to get a totally different meaning (no part of
which is redundant) for the epigraph as a whole. This is
hardly ever the case with other alleged hidden messages.

3) Not only does this meaning make at least as much sense
as the original, it is no less grammatical, is coherent,
indicates that it *is* cryptic, and provides a message
which actually says something very relevant in terms of
the authorship controversy. Equally, every part of the
inscription contributes to that meaning. No proposed
authorship 'secret writing' has ever achieved this before.

4) The inscriptions on this and the grave have a surprising
number of strange or unusual features, most - if not all -
of which contribute to the riddle's overall solution (or
its survival!). The following certainly do.

a) Suggesting that someone who is already reading the
epigraph might not be *able* to read it.

b) Splitting the word 'within' into two words, which by
the time the monument was erected was very unusual. In
a large sample of contemporary writing I was able to
find only 3 such cases out of 531 uses of the word.

c) Saying that Shakespeare had been placed 'within' the
*monument* - something that has been found puzzling
by quite a few commentators.

d) The word 'Sieh', an alleged mis-spelling of the sub-
ordinating conjunction 'sith'.

e) The lack of any punctuation before 'Shakspeare'; the
colons (rather than commas) after 'dide' and before
'Sieh'; also the helpful commas either side of 'Far
more' and after 'all'

f) The ambiguous, even cryptic, nature of the last line.

g) The selection of Nestor, Socrates and Virgil as meta-
phors, none of whom seems really appropriate for Shake-
speare, but who would fit the situation suggested by
the new meaning very well.

h) Shakespeare's gravestone not having his name upon it.

i) The grave's 'curse', which has apparently succeeded in
keeping it unchanged for nearly 400 years.

5) The fact that each of seven words needing re-interpretation
in solving the riddle is 'flagged' by being given a wrong-
sized initial capital letter; and the chance of this
happening by accident being less than one in a thousand
million! That is the big one.

Taken all together, however, it is these reasons which
convince me that the poem on the monument was intentionally
cryptic and actually means, if not precisely the following,
something very similar to it:

&quot;Pause, traveller. Why go by so quickly? Work out, if you can,
whom envious Death has placed in this monument WITH Shake-
speare (with whom quick - i.e. not thought 'dead' - Nature
died): Christopher Marlowe. He is returned, in spite of
everything! That HE did the writing leaves Art still alive,
without a page to dish up his wit.&quot;

No, I don't think so. At that time (still plain Thomas W.) he
had inherited Scadbury from his elder brother and pretty much
retired from such work. Sir Francis was, of course, dead by
then. On the other hand, it is of some relevance to note that
the Privy Council knew that Marlowe would probably be found
staying with Thomas when they wanted him brought before them.

No, Peter, your interpretation is too far-fetched to make sense. The
weakest point in your monumental erection of an artificially
constructed effort to turn a bad Shakespeare flattery into something
desperately Marlovian is your transforming of &quot;Far more&quot; into
Christopher Marlowe's name, using &quot;Christ&quot; (as the alleged owner of the
church and monument) as the key to your cramped interpretorial
contraption with no wheels but clay feet, forgetting that Marlowe
hardly even was a Christian - Christ would probably be the last means
he would ever have used to guide anyone into guessing his name. I don't
even think he would ever have deigned to engage in any effort of a
representation of him in a church, not even by the abstrusest
cryptogram. It is much more plausible, then, that some ignorant burgher
fan of Stratford construed this doggerel fake of a versed inscription,
which matches very well the foolish lines on that infamous statue, who
did not know much grammar, wasn't quite sure of what he was engraving
and made a rather hashed mess of it. I still wouldn't think that either
Marlowe nor Bacon ever would have placed a foot in such a backward
place.

Thanks anyway for your invitation and effort to teach me some nonsense.

&gt;&gt; This is deplorable, Peter. This is what I get out of

&gt; This is incorrect. In fact not a single line of it
&gt; accurately reflects either what it actually says now
&gt; or what it said before the refurbishment of 1974. If
&gt; you do not transcribe it correctly, you will never be
&gt; able to decipher it anyway.

&gt; I invite you to look at the following article, where
&gt; the pre-1974 version is illustrated.
&gt;&lt;http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/riddle.htm&gt;

&gt; An accurate transcript of this (excluding ligatures,
&gt; and using upper and lower case instead of different
&gt; sized capitals) is:

&gt; Stay Passenger, why goest thov by so fast?
&gt; read if thov canst, whom enviovs Death hath plast,
&gt; with in this monvment Shakspeare: with whome,
&gt; qvick natvre dide: whose name, doth deck y\s Tombe,
&gt; Far more, then cost: Sieh all, y\t He hath writt,
&gt; Leaves living art, bvt page, to serve his witt.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; The impression which your interpretation gives me is
&gt;&gt; that you have stumbled into the Baconian trap of making
&gt;&gt; anything out of a document except what's written in it.
&gt;&gt; Nothing has impeded antistratfordianism more than this
&gt;&gt; dreadful aberration. Any alteration of a document must
&gt;&gt; lead any interpretation of it astray. This is elementary.

&gt; Precisely. This is why, unlike most commentators (and you),
&gt; I insist upon the accurate transcription of the monument,
&gt; and reject any changes made simply to fit in with what it
&gt; is *assumed* that the meaning must be.

&gt; You chose to ignore that part of an earlier post in which
&gt; I drew attention to the changes of *meaning* that I was
&gt; suggesting for various words. Other than the 'puzzle' bit
&gt; in the middle, of course, I gave no alternative for a word
&gt; which was not as acceptable - if not more so - than the
&gt; one any casual reader was obviously intended to take.

&gt; For those who missed it, here it is again:

&gt;&lt;quote&gt;

&gt; Stay Passenger, why goest thou by so fast?
&gt; read (1) if thou canst, whom envious Death hath plast
&gt; with (2), in this monument, Shakspeare: with whome
&gt; quick (3) nature dide: Christ- (4)
&gt; ofer Marley: he is returned withal (5): that He (6)
&gt; hath writt,
&gt; Leaves living art but page to serve his witt.

&gt; 1. 'Solve' or 'work out' *whom*, rather than just
&gt; 'read' the words, as one might think.
&gt; 2. 'With' as a separate word, rather than as part of
&gt; the word 'within', as one might think.
&gt; 3. 'Quick' as the opposite of dead (as Marlowe was
&gt; supposed to have been), rather than 'bursting
&gt; with life', as one might think.
&gt; 4. The owner of the name decking the 'Tombe' (ie
&gt; the grave, rather than the monument, as one might
&gt; think). The word 'Christ' then leads logically to
&gt; the rest of the name one's been told to work out.
&gt; 5. 'Sieh' is not the misprint one might think, but
&gt; a rebus - 'he is' returned (with 'all').
&gt; 6. 'He' must now be the person just identified, rather
&gt; than 'Shakspeare' as one might think. If so the
&gt; meaning of the last line has to reflect this:
&gt; 'art' (Marlowe) is left still living, sans page
&gt; (Shakespeare) to serve (up) his wit.

&gt;&lt;unquote&gt;

&gt; Now, the question is whether such a hidden meaning
&gt; was included deliberately. Here is what I argued in
&gt; the thread &quot;Why the Monument's 'Riddle' is Valid&quot;.

&gt;&lt;quote&gt;

&gt; It seems to me that there are several stages one should go
&gt; through in determining whether or not the hidden meaning I
&gt; stumbled upon really was deliberately included in the monu-
&gt; ment's inscription. At each stage, the likelihood of it
&gt; being a genuine hidden message increases, finishing up by
&gt; being as near to certainty as makes no difference at all.

&gt; 1) By treating one part of the poem, marked out by two
&gt; colons, as a rebus it is possible to discover Christ-
&gt; opher Marlowe's complete name, and as he himself spelt
&gt; it. This is already further than most suggested hidden
&gt; messages ever get.

&gt; 2) Furthermore, by interpreting a few of the other words in
&gt; a different - but equally acceptable - way, it is also
&gt; possible to get a totally different meaning (no part of
&gt; which is redundant) for the epigraph as a whole. This is
&gt; hardly ever the case with other alleged hidden messages.

&gt; 3) Not only does this meaning make at least as much sense
&gt; as the original, it is no less grammatical, is coherent,
&gt; indicates that it *is* cryptic, and provides a message
&gt; which actually says something very relevant in terms of
&gt; the authorship controversy. Equally, every part of the
&gt; inscription contributes to that meaning. No proposed
&gt; authorship 'secret writing' has ever achieved this before.

&gt; 4) The inscriptions on this and the grave have a surprising
&gt; number of strange or unusual features, most - if not all -
&gt; of which contribute to the riddle's overall solution (or
&gt; its survival!). The following certainly do.

&gt; a) Suggesting that someone who is already reading the
&gt; epigraph might not be *able* to read it.

&gt; b) Splitting the word 'within' into two words, which by
&gt; the time the monument was erected was very unusual. In
&gt; a large sample of contemporary writing I was able to
&gt; find only 3 such cases out of 531 uses of the word.

&gt; c) Saying that Shakespeare had been placed 'within' the
&gt; *monument* - something that has been found puzzling
&gt; by quite a few commentators.

&gt; d) The word 'Sieh', an alleged mis-spelling of the sub-
&gt; ordinating conjunction 'sith'.

&gt; e) The lack of any punctuation before 'Shakspeare'; the
&gt; colons (rather than commas) after 'dide' and before
&gt; 'Sieh'; also the helpful commas either side of 'Far
&gt; more' and after 'all'

&gt; f) The ambiguous, even cryptic, nature of the last line.

&gt; g) The selection of Nestor, Socrates and Virgil as meta-
&gt; phors, none of whom seems really appropriate for Shake-
&gt; speare, but who would fit the situation suggested by
&gt; the new meaning very well.

&gt; h) Shakespeare's gravestone not having his name upon it.

&gt; i) The grave's 'curse', which has apparently succeeded in
&gt; keeping it unchanged for nearly 400 years.

&gt; 5) The fact that each of seven words needing re-interpretation
&gt; in solving the riddle is 'flagged' by being given a wrong-
&gt; sized initial capital letter; and the chance of this
&gt; happening by accident being less than one in a thousand
&gt; million! That is the big one.

&gt; Taken all together, however, it is these reasons which
&gt; convince me that the poem on the monument was intentionally
&gt; cryptic and actually means, if not precisely the following,
&gt; something very similar to it:

&gt;&quot;Pause, traveller. Why go by so quickly? Work out, if you can,
&gt; whom envious Death has placed in this monument WITH Shake-

&gt; died): Christopher Marlowe. He is returned, in spite of
&gt; everything! That HE did the writing leaves Art still alive,
&gt; without a page to dish up his wit.&quot;

&gt;&lt;unquote&gt;

&gt;&gt; I am sorry, but I can find no support for any alternative
&gt;&gt; to faithful stratfordianism in this case. I don'¨t think
&gt;&gt; neither Bacon nor Marlowe ever went to Stratford.

&gt; Really? I don't think that neither of them *never* went

Yes. I don't think Bob Grumman would be our ideal medical expert. It
would be interesting indeed to see if such a wound described by Coroner
Danby could be fatal in any case. I find it noteworthy that he
explicitly doesn't say that the knife went into the eye but into the
skull above the eye &quot;two inches deep&quot;. That would be something like a
trepanation. I find it very difficult to believe that a knife could
result in such a wound, if the man using it stabs it backwards from a
rather awkward position sqeezed in between two other fellows - the
skull bone is hard to penetrate. The obvious deduction from Danvy's
report is that the knife must have slipped into the eye. If it could be
established that such a wound in no case could lead to &quot;instant death&quot;,
the Danby report would be proved a fake (which I think most people who
have studied it carefully always have thought).

Precisely. Coroner Danby is as scientific as any government authority
official could be in the 16th century, defining everything exactly and
maybe using a ruler (or some such means) to measure the exact depth of
the wound. Of course, what is more interesting here is everything that
he DOESN'T say, for instance exactly how the wound went into the head,
straight or slantingly, whether the eye was ruined and what traits on
the corpse could establish it beyond a shadow as really Marlowe's. 16
witnesses were used to establish the fact that Marlowe was dead, to
make sure there would be no more trouble with him, that is, to make
sure no one would disturb him any more.

My view is of course that the 16 witnesses didn't know Marlowe, could
not identify him and were used only to attest the formality. My theory
is that Danby very well knew it wasn't Marlowe but had been given the
order to make it Marlowe by members of the Privy Council or maybe even
by the Queen - the authorities might very well have been sick and tired
of all the turbulence about Marlowe caused by his enemies. As I said in
some previous post long ago, Coroner Danby probably had many bodies to
choose between - there was a plague going on. I think the Penry theory
is rather long-sought. Any youngish male body would have done, and
Danby could even have given it an efficient cut himself to make sure no
one would search for other causes of the corpse's death. This then
might have been Danby's very and fatal mistake - such a wound,
inflicted as a fake to over-convince the witnesses of a very brutal
death, would not have been mortal, as doctors would observe 300 years
later on, when Coroner Danby's faithful expediency for the first time
would be exposed to the eyes of qualified critics.

&gt;&gt; is that Danby very well knew it wasn't Marlowe but had been given the
&gt;&gt; order to make it Marlowe by members of the Privy Council or maybe even
&gt;&gt; by the Queen - the authorities might very well have been sick and tired
&gt;&gt; of all the turbulence about Marlowe caused by his enemies. As I said in
&gt;&gt; some previous post long ago, Coroner Danby probably had many bodies to
&gt;&gt; choose between - there was a plague going on. I think the Penry theory
&gt;&gt; is rather long-sought. Any youngish male body would have done, and
&gt;&gt; Danby could even have given it an efficient cut himself to make sure no
&gt;&gt; one would search for other causes of the corpse's death. This then
&gt;&gt; might have been Danby's very and fatal mistake - such a wound,
&gt;&gt; inflicted as a fake to over-convince the witnesses of a very brutal
&gt;&gt; death, would not have been mortal, as doctors would observe 300 years
&gt;&gt; later on, when Coroner Danby's faithful expediency for the first time
&gt;&gt; would be exposed to the eyes of qualified critics.

That's a fascinating and sobering article, but I personally would need
to understand the terminology better--maybe some of the others have
been learning it. It looks like there are more articles that would
cover the details we want.

There is a lot we don't know---how much force was used, whether or not
the knife was removed, etc. Those are listed as important. And perhaps
it did pierce part of the skull, in which case a piece of bone could
have entered the brain.

It doesn't seem, however, from reading this, that instant death
generally or ever occurs for a minor stab wound--it sounds like one
might go into a coma first.

*Assuming* the stabwound was minor.

In any case there is also the possibility that Marlow's death was caused
by brain injury sustained by falling (after being stabbed) and cracking
his skull on the table/floor/ or wall. If that were the case then the
knife wound would be only the apparent cause of death.

My goodness!
Well, I'm not sure exactly how critical each of those areas is to life
itself (you could go blind or become paralyzed, etc., of course), but
the carotid artery seems like one of the most critical. (Brain stem and
some others also seem important.)

I am looking at a medical guide that has a profile of a person's
circulatory system, and it seems to show the carotid and jugular
branching out into smaller arteries and veins, not too many near the
eyes, yet one carotid looks like it is right near the eyes. And I see
other images on the web that show more near the eyes. One would need a
3-D picture to really tell how close the carotid was to the eyes,
though.

One also needs consider that if a two inch wound is so unbelievable as a

There are two alternatives. Either you are right, and that would be the
final Marlowe proof, the ultimate nail into Shakspere's coffin, which
would make all further argument in the case redundant. In that case, it
would, as you say, be of no consequence who wrote the text. It would
indeed then point more to Marlowe after all than to Ben Jonson, perhaps
to the subtle mind of Bacon but hardly to anyone else, least of all, of
course, to Shakspere.

However, it is very difficult to make it fit that Ben Jonson would have
been privy to the case. All his Shakespeare flattery and
acknowledgement speaks good faith and honesty. He seems to have been
more intimately connected with Shakspere than with Bacon, although the
connection with Bacon is obvious, but nothing seems to indicate more
than superficial ties. The fact that he entered the stage long after
the Deptford show adds to the assumption that he never knew about its
backstage business. At least, the possibility of his ignorance can't be
eliminated.

The other alternative is that everything written is true, that Jonson
wrote the truth about Shakespeare and nothing but the truth, that Bacon
was not involved and that Marlowe was murdered. This is the official
Stratfordian statement of the case. There is no proof against it, only
an immeasurable ocean of circumstantial evidence, which involves at
least Bacon and William Stanley (continuing Oxford's contributions) as
co-authors to the surviving hand of Marlowe, which puts Shakespeare as
a dummy in the limelight taking the applause, appearing as the
frontispiece, acting as no more than the Producer at most, least of all
as the writer, no more than a clever businessman and amiable stage
diplomat, knowing how to keep up appearances and maintain a good name.
I must say I find this possibility more attractive and acceptable.

Why? Simply because William Shakspere from Stratford is not convincing
as the sole author of Shakespeare. There is too much Bacon in him,
there is too much Marlowe in him, there is too much Stanley (both
brothers) involved in the case and even too much Oxford.

Your interpretation of that text bit is a hard one to swallow, and I
don't believe many would be capable of it. It is too far-fetched to be
naturally convincing, while the only argument for it is, that there
would have been no other motive for going through the pains of
composing and engraving such an unintelligible text.

I am of a doubtful nature and disposition, so I can't say neither yes
or no. I leave the question open and unsettled. I am afraid that's the
best thing I can do.

Keep alert for further argument.

Although it seems certain to me that this message tells us
that Christopher Marlowe is in some sense sharing the mon-
ument with Shakespeare, it is still not absolutely clear as
to precisely what this means, nor whether whoever put it
there either knew what he was talking about or was telling
the truth about it if he did. It also raises the huge question
of just how much of the writing, if any, was done by each
of them, and for precisely which bits they were responsible.

Any acceptance of my actual claim would therefore be only
the start of a whole new argument on the subject.

I'm not sure that I would link flattery with honesty! In

&gt; I think not. As I said:

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I claim is (a) that there is a second, hidden, meaning
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the Stratford monument and (b) that it is beyond reason-
&gt;&gt;&gt; able doubt that this message was put there deliberately.

&gt; Although it seems certain to me that this message tells us
&gt; that Christopher Marlowe is in some sense sharing the mon-

&gt; to precisely what this means, nor whether whoever put it
&gt; there either knew what he was talking about or was telling
&gt; the truth about it if he did. It also raises the huge question
&gt; of just how much of the writing, if any, was done by each

Agreed. Much confusion here. You will find it very difficult to
convince anyone of your interpretation of it, perhaps only one person
in the world, perhaps not even fully yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Any acceptance of my actual claim would therefore be only
&gt; the start of a whole new argument on the subject.

An endless argument, since a totally abstract inscription like this can
be twisted around into almost any interpretation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In that case, it would, as you say, be of no consequence
&gt;&gt; who wrote the text.

&gt; I did *not* say that. It would be of immense consequence
&gt; - not least because of the doubts I expressed above. What I
&gt; said was that the question of who wrote it makes no differ-
&gt; ence to the argument upon which I base those two conclusions.

"/>

What about George Chapman? The ideal abstract poet to make something
totally impossible to understand any logical meaning of, since he had
no sense of any logic himself. That's why he was the perfect poet to
complete &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, producing any conclusion as better than no
conclusion at all. I am not sure if it's even known when he died.
Perhaps he wasn't aware of it himself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It would indeed then point more to Marlowe after all than
&gt;&gt; to Ben Jonson, perhaps to the subtle mind of Bacon but
&gt;&gt; hardly to anyone else, least of all, of course, to Shakspere.

&gt; I certainly wouldn't rule Shakespeare out if it had been
&gt; designed well in advance. And do you know who wrote this?

&gt; If, passenger, thou canst but read:
&gt; Stay, drop a tear for him that's dead, ...

"/>

Sorry, I have no references available at the moment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; However, it is very difficult to make it fit that Ben
&gt;&gt; Jonson would have been privy to the case. All his Shake-
&gt;&gt; speare flattery and acknowledgement speaks good faith
&gt;&gt; and honesty.

&gt; I'm not sure that I would link flattery with honesty! In
&gt; any case, I think it is unwise to project modern ideas of
&gt; honesty onto 17th century thinking. I am quite sure, for
&gt; example, that (if I am right about the second meaning) the
&gt; author would have felt that he *was* being truthful, even
&gt; if that truth was being deliberately concealed.

&gt;&gt; He seems to have been more intimately connected with
&gt;&gt; Shakspere than with Bacon, although the connection with
&gt;&gt; Bacon is obvious, but nothing seems to indicate more
&gt;&gt; than superficial ties. The fact that he entered the stage
&gt;&gt; long after the Deptford show adds to the assumption that
&gt;&gt; he never knew about its backstage business.

&gt; Whilst he may well have known nothing about it at the time,
&gt; I see little justification for assuming that he must there-
&gt; fore have *never* known about it.

&gt;&gt; At least, the possibility of his ignorance can't be
&gt;&gt; eliminated.

&gt; Not eliminated, perhaps, but (once again assuming that
&gt; I am right) his role in the presentation of the First Folio
&gt; would certainly support the view that he was fully aware
&gt; of what was going on. The two-person Droeshout portrait is
&gt; the big give-away on that, along with Digges's &quot;And Time
&gt; dissolves (i.e. solves) thy Stratford Moniment&quot;.

&gt;&gt; The other alternative is that everything written is true,
&gt;&gt; that Jonson wrote the truth about Shakespeare and nothing
&gt;&gt; but the truth, that Bacon was not involved and that Marlowe
&gt;&gt; was murdered.

&gt; Or killed in self-defence, presumably, as the inquest found.

"/>

Don't be absurd. The inquest is absurd. Anyone giving it any credit is
absurd.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; This is the official Stratfordian statement of the case.

&gt; This is the general view of virtually all Shakespearean
&gt; scholars, whether they have ever given thought to the
&gt; authorship question or not.

"/>

A very limited view, excluding all other more credible possibilities,
like sticking to the general view that the world was flat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There is no proof against it, only an immeasurable ocean
&gt;&gt; of circumstantial evidence, which involves at least Bacon
&gt;&gt; and William Stanley (continuing Oxford's contributions) as
&gt;&gt; co-authors to the surviving hand of Marlowe, which puts
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare as a dummy in the limelight taking the applause,
&gt;&gt; appearing as the frontispiece, acting as no more than the
&gt;&gt; Producer at most, least of all as the writer, no more than
&gt;&gt; a clever businessman and amiable stage diplomat, knowing
&gt;&gt; how to keep up appearances and maintain a good name. I must
&gt;&gt; say I find this possibility more attractive and acceptable.

&gt;&gt; Why? Simply because William Shakspere from Stratford is not
&gt;&gt; convincing as the sole author of Shakespeare. There is too
&gt;&gt; much Bacon in him, there is too much Marlowe in him, there
&gt;&gt; is too much Stanley (both brothers) involved in the case
&gt;&gt; and even too much Oxford.

&gt; And this is precisely the sort of subjective argument which
&gt; allows Stratfordians to walk all over us.

&gt;&gt; Your interpretation of that text bit is a hard one to
&gt;&gt; swallow, and I don't believe many would be capable of it.

&gt; Experience has proved you right on that one. In this case,
&gt; however, I find it an inadequate reason for changing my
&gt; mind, since I believe that most people have no idea of how
&gt; such a matter should be judged. With respect, I think that
&gt; you are a particularly good example.

&gt;&gt; It is too far-fetched to be naturally convincing,

&gt; You see, that is quite meaningless. Or at least it simply
&gt; tells us that from your twenty-first century viewpoint you
&gt; find it unconvincing, which is totally irrelevant as to
&gt; whether my *arguments* are right or wrong.

&gt;&gt; while the only argument for it is, that there would have
&gt;&gt; been no other motive for going through the pains of
&gt;&gt; composing and engraving such an unintelligible text.

&gt; That is *not* the argument for it. I have given you the
&gt; argument for it three times now, and you have totally
&gt; ignored it every time! Here it is a fourth time. There are
&gt; many unusual or strange features in the epigraph and
&gt; grave-stone, nearly all of which are necessary for the
&gt; hidden meaning which I have pointed out to be possible.
&gt; The probability of this happening by accident is so low
&gt; as to make the deliberate hiding of such a hidden
&gt; message a virtual certainty.

"/>

I have ignored nothing of what you have written. I am merely trying to
stick to the point, that is, stick to what is concrete in this case.
What is least concrete in this case is your abstract interpretation of
an abstract monument. The first impression anyone gets from reading
this &quot;cryptogram&quot; is that whoever made it started of well enough and
then got lost before reaching any sense of it, succeeding no more than
in producing an awkward kind of halting rhyme. That is still my
dominating impression. I am aware of the danger of the temptation to
&quot;simplify&quot; a difficult thing, but it's not altogether simplificatrion
in this case but rather a preference for sticking to logic and common
sense than to take a total lack of clarity as something meaningful.

There are much better and more interesting arguments for both Bacon and
Marlowe, in comparison with which this &quot;monumental interpretation&quot; of
yours rather drags down their case into a bog of abstraction than adds
to its credibility. The &quot;Promus&quot; by Bacon is full av Shakespearisms
dated to before those Shakepearisms were published, the late Marlowe
and early Shakespeare texts are so impossible to separate so as to make
their confused identity inexplainable by any other means than by
attributiing them to the same author, and you yourself have admirably
succeeded in explaining the obvious deception at Deptford with the sole
possible motive to save Marlowe's life and continued useful service to
the Crown and to the Theatre. But Marlowe was also in others' service,
possibly in Bacon's, which makes it possible that Bacon was his
ghost-writer, which would turn Bacon into Marlowe AND Shakespeare. This
is the argument that interests me.

Jonson worked extremely hard and became extremely accomplished at what he
set out to do, but he was no genius like Shakespeare and he knew it. That
pissed him off and led to envy, and he knew that, too.

I also think that Ben Jonson was envious and pissed off, but then he
was competing with several writers, some of the best poets and
playwrights in England, so he was bound to come in second. I'm not
sure he even knew who the Shakespeare writers were, but he could take
out his grudge on Mr. Stratford, a sort of poison brewed up with sweet
beloved regard, he was allowed that much by the grand possessors.

This is probably rather close to the truth. I found an old essay from
2001. Here is an excerpt:

&quot;I think a certain pseudonym called 'Benedict' hit the point when
he depicted the situation in a theatrical scene, which shows publishers
brooding over the already completed printing of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;,
realizing they can't publish it in the author's name, since he has
been totally scandalized, his name having become anathema, branded
forever by Puritans as Atheist, the worst libel of all. The realism of
the situation is that if they publish it in his name they won't
succeed in selling a single copy.

At that moment a certain Stratford man comes to London trying his luck,
having been forced to leave Stratford for its desperate unemployment
situation in these difficult times of the Plague, coming to London for
the sole purpose of making money in order to support himself and his
family. He has done some acting, so he looks for something to do at the
theatre in the precise moment when the news is spread that the great
Marlowe of &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot; is dead, the whole free-thinking
upper class giving a sigh of relief, since they all knew he had been
under threat of arrest and torture for Atheism, Thomas Kyd having
already been racked and made to confess. With the ensured total silence
of Marlowe, the safety of the Walsinghams, the Cecils, the Bacons, the
Catholics Oxford and Derby, Sir Walter Raleigh, Northumberland and many
others was also ensured.

But who was this fresh country actor from Stratford? He was found to be
a decent chap of good humour and honesty, with a nice flow of speech, a
reliable actor of some talent and stability of mind. Why don't we
help him along? What about using that untarnished unknown name for that
exquisite poem, unpublishable in the name of Marlowe? He might need
some money, Marlowe has left us so he won't object, and Sir Thomas
Walsingham will surely agree. Let's give Will Shakspere a chance of
making an honest career. And Will Shakspere, needing some money rather
badly, was not so stupid as to decline the offer. The publishers
contributed some convincing dedicatory epistle in flattery of the young
earl of Southampton for his covering some of the costs - and it all
turned out a greater success than expected. This started the triumphant
victory path of the trademark William Shakespeare, and the honest man
who had appeared on the right spot at the right moment did not object
but knew how to play his part and sustain it, since his livelihood was
saved.

Meanwhile Marlowe kept away most probably in Italy for many years,
keeping busy writing new Italian plays in Verona and later making
friends with the Duke Orsino di Bracciano, for whom he wrote &quot;Twelfth
Night&quot; to be staged in London to welcome the Duke at the court of Queen
Elizabeth for a few days around Twelfth Night in 1600. It's quite
possible and even probable that Marlowe and Shakspere never met each
other. The business between them was wholly transacted by agents,
through Sir Thomas Walsingham and through Sir Francis Bacon and his
brother Anthony, who kept up the network of all English agents around
Europe. No one else needed to know except those very few who were
needed to arrange delivery and production. For Shakspere, it was purely
a business matter - no questions asked, since there was nothing to
complain about. Mum was the only word needed to keep up business.

Enter Ben Jonson, who being so much younger knew nothing about the
Marlowe crisis. So he would suspect nothing if he was told nothing. His
admiration of Shakspere was totally unreserved and sincere, and there
is no reason to suspect any conscious falsity on his part. He knew
Shakspere from his fellow actor's best side, and he did not bother
about what he did not know. His style is totally alien from the
Marlovian-Shakespearean romanticism, which fact marks the
Marlowe-Shakespeare style more sharply as unique and united.

But of course, the show could not go on forever, and in the end
Shakspere was satisfied enough to pull out of business and enjoy his
last years at home without having to put on any acts any more. He had
made enough money to be the richest citizen of Stratford, so he had
nothing to complain of and just continued to keep his silence about the
best deal of his life.&quot;

etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But who was this fresh country actor from Stratford? He was found to be

&gt;&gt;&gt;but knew how to play his part and sustain it, since his livelihood was

&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile Marlowe kept away most probably in Italy for many years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;keeping busy writing new Italian plays in Verona and later making
&gt;&gt;&gt;friends with the Duke Orsino di Bracciano, for whom he wrote &quot;Twelfth
&gt;&gt;&gt;Night&quot; to be staged in London to welcome the Duke at the court of Queen
&gt;&gt;&gt;Elizabeth for a few days around Twelfth Night in 1600. It's quite

I'm bored at work, so I'll join my voice to the chorus that says, &quot;No,
Shakespeareans don't have to take into account a bizarre scenario in
which Christopher Marlowe didn't really die in Debtford.&quot;

So what if he didn't die? Good for him, I say! I hope he had a nice
Italian retirement.

I did read a lot of comics, and such study has helped me to know of
Superheroes, which has been very helpful when discussing the STRATMAN
and his powers, the best of which is invisibility. Like the Shadow, he
fogged men's minds, still does, and the Strats have no lamp to find
him, he is surrounded by darkness and business dealings. His real
person, and the Strats will avouch it, has nothing to do with the
writing of poems and such. His name was planted on several title pages,
but that's a footprint only, the foot can't be found. Oh, yes, he's a
Superhero, I know them of old. Reedy needs and believes in him, let it
go, he will get long trousers by and by.

If I were a Strat, and a keeper of the Great Delusion, I would be
interested to know if any lesser delusions were catching up. We have
examples here. Notice how the Strats are going nuts over Gangleri's
numbers, the whole business is driving them batty, it's almost as
bizarre as what the Strats have got going and it worries them. Also,
take a look at the way Webb has devoted half his cyber-life to condemn
and mock at Neuendorffer, like he recognizes that Freemasonry is just
as weird as the Strat scenario, and it frets Webb terribly. Sure, if I
were a Strat I'd worry about the competition. It's not easy to be the

I am chiefly interested in the more plausible anti-Stratfordian
scenarios and in the more intelligent anti-Stratfordians; the latter
explains why I waste little time on buffoons like Richard Kennedy, who
as Peter Groves has already noted is ineducable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I also think that Ben Jonson was envious and pissed off, but then he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was competing with several writers, some of the best poets and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;playwrights in England, so he was bound to come in second. I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sure he even knew who the Shakespeare writers were, but he could take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out his grudge on Mr. Stratford, a sort of poison brewed up with sweet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beloved regard, he was allowed that much by the grand possessors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is probably rather close to the truth. I found an old essay from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2001. Here is an excerpt:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I think a certain pseudonym called 'Benedict' hit the point when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;he depicted the situation in a theatrical scene, which shows publishers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brooding over the already completed printing of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;realizing they can't publish it in the author's name, since he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;been totally scandalized, his name having become anathema, branded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;forever by Puritans as Atheist, the worst libel of all. The realism of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the situation is that if they publish it in his name they won't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;succeed in selling a single copy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At that moment a certain Stratford man comes to London trying his luck,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;having been forced to leave Stratford for its desperate unemployment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;situation in these difficult times of the Plague, coming to London for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the sole purpose of making money in order to support himself and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;family. He has done some acting, so he looks for something to do at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;theatre in the precise moment when the news is spread that the great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marlowe of &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot; is dead, the whole free-thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;upper class giving a sigh of relief, since they all knew he had been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;under threat of arrest and torture for Atheism, Thomas Kyd having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;already been racked and made to confess. With the ensured total silence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Marlowe, the safety of the Walsinghams, the Cecils, the Bacons, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Catholics Oxford and Derby, Sir Walter Raleigh, Northumberland and many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;others was also ensured.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But who was this fresh country actor from Stratford? He was found to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a decent chap of good humour and honesty, with a nice flow of speech, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reliable actor of some talent and stability of mind. Why don't we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;help him along? What about using that untarnished unknown name for that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exquisite poem, unpublishable in the name of Marlowe? He might need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some money, Marlowe has left us so he won't object, and Sir Thomas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Walsingham will surely agree. Let's give Will Shakspere a chance of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;making an honest career. And Will Shakspere, needing some money rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;badly, was not so stupid as to decline the offer. The publishers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contributed some convincing dedicatory epistle in flattery of the young
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;earl of Southampton for his covering some of the costs - and it all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turned out a greater success than expected. This started the triumphant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;victory path of the trademark William Shakespeare, and the honest man
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who had appeared on the right spot at the right moment did not object
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but knew how to play his part and sustain it, since his livelihood was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;saved.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile Marlowe kept away most probably in Italy for many years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;keeping busy writing new Italian plays in Verona and later making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;friends with the Duke Orsino di Bracciano, for whom he wrote &quot;Twelfth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Night&quot; to be staged in London to welcome the Duke at the court of Queen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Elizabeth for a few days around Twelfth Night in 1600. It's quite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible and even probable that Marlowe and Shakspere never met each
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other. The business between them was wholly transacted by agents,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through Sir Thomas Walsingham and through Sir Francis Bacon and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brother Anthony, who kept up the network of all English agents around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Europe. No one else needed to know except those very few who were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needed to arrange delivery and production. For Shakspere, it was purely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a business matter - no questions asked, since there was nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;complain about. Mum was the only word needed to keep up business.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Enter Ben Jonson, who being so much younger knew nothing about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marlowe crisis. So he would suspect nothing if he was told nothing. His
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;admiration of Shakspere was totally unreserved and sincere, and there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is no reason to suspect any conscious falsity on his part. He knew
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakspere from his fellow actor's best side, and he did not bother
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about what he did not know. His style is totally alien from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marlovian-Shakespearean romanticism, which fact marks the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marlowe-Shakespeare style more sharply as unique and united.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But of course, the show could not go on forever, and in the end
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakspere was satisfied enough to pull out of business and enjoy his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last years at home without having to put on any acts any more. He had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;made enough money to be the richest citizen of Stratford, so he had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nothing to complain of and just continued to keep his silence about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;best deal of his life.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you probably read too many comic books as a youngster.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TR

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even if I would have studied comics instead of books as a child it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't help the fact that the above scenario is a possibility which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;even Stratfordians sooner or later have to take into account.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think not. Groundless speculation is not a reason to make a dim
&gt;&gt;&gt;possibility into into a probable truth.

&gt;&gt; Evidently you have missed something of the discussion and new research
&gt;&gt; that started off 1805 with the first Baconian, who founded his
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare doubts on the fact that he (after careful local research)
&gt;&gt; found stratfordianism groundless.

James Wilmot missed nothing since he more painstakingly than anyone
else before or after him combed through the whole of Warwickshire in
search of any memory of Shakespeare and found nothing except the
phoniest monumental texts in the world of more than usual ridiculous
nonsense. Mind you, he was (like I believe all of us) at first an
extremely undoubting Stratfordian. His Stratfordian research was
motivated by his very sincere ambition to write an honest biography of
Shakespeare but found no material for it in reality. That's why the
results made him the first Baconian - there was no other alternative in
those days. Marlowe, Derby, Oxford and others were &quot;discovered&quot; not
less than 90 years later on.

You do grasp the point that (why, Lord, why do I try?) Wilmot &quot;combed&quot;
Warwickshire more than one hundred years after Shakespeare died, long
after anyone who knew Shakespeare, or even Shakespeare's children, was
dead? Even Shakespeare's grandchildren were dead by the time Wilmot
got his bright idea. You get that, right?

Dear Andy,

In England it's practically impossible, if you are a man of letters,
not to leave anything written behind, which mementos invariably are
preserved by following generations. In this case we are dealing with a
national poet. What puzzled James Wilmot was that NOTHING WHATSOEVER
had been conserved of William Shakspere ANYWHERE IN WARWICKSHIRE by
ANYONE. It also puzzled Mark Twain, Henry James, Daphne du Maurier and
others of that kind who, like Wilmot, found reasons not to take the
Stratford cult seriously.

It is not unheard of for men of letters to burn their personal

Don't be ridiculous. There is no end of the story just because you say
so. Don't forget the facts we have about Shakespeare, his miserly

which he published here about the actually remaining proofs of the

What the Strats don't understand is that they were &quot;intended&quot; to
believe in the Stratford man, as simplistic as that is, as silly as
that is. The people who advanced the idea knew their audience very
well, and knew that such persons as Spam, Webb, Reedy, and even all the
rest, could easily be duped. It was planned that way by some people
who knew the character of the crowd and the gullets of such geese as
those named above, who have been stuffed with the mealy hoax, and now
we anti-Strats are having their livers for supper.

It's true that some people of that era considered him to be England's

to collect the letters and private papers of contemporary poets and put

It is a fact that we have some documents from a few lawsuits.
The idea that they were &quot;miserly&quot; is not a fact, it's an
opinion. The idea that a great author would never, after
getting stiffed, resort to the courts is also just an opinion.

It is a fact that we have two marks and no signatures from
Judith's hand. It is a fact that we have a signature from
the hand of Susanna. If we go by the expert consensus, Judith
was *possibly* completely illiterate and Susanna was probably
completely literate. In short, Judith's state of literacy appears
to be about average for the daughter of someone of Shakespeare's
social class. Susanna's level of literacy would appear to
be somewhat unusual. Why should we expect anything different?
Have you found some evidence that suggests that the daughters
of commoner Elizabethan writers were usually educated above
their station? If not then what you have is an opinion
about facts.

Yes, several of Shakespeare's surviving signatures appear
to have been very badly executed. However, very few(if any)
experts in Elizabethan paleography appear to believe that
poorly executed signatures are a reliable indicators for
illiteracy.

&gt; on. A few years ago Pat Dooley made a thorough research the results of

I was very much a part of that discussion here on hlas. As
I recall, Pat's research with few exceptions, consisted of
attempts to defend Diana Price's work. (One exception was
his venture into regression analysis, which I'm guessing
he'd probably rather forget.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Everyone was on the plus side except

Diana Price picked arbitrary standards and then applied them
inconsistently to a poorly chosen group of writers. (For
example, she seems to have thought that it was reasonable
to compare Shakespeare's documentary life to that of William
Drummond, a man who happens to have been a Scottish Laird.)
As I pointed out at the time, if we drop her arbitrarily chosen
standard for contemporary notice(which seens to have been
selected just so she could exclude some records for Shakespeare)
and apply the rest of the standards evenly(arbitrary though they
be), Shakespeare's &quot;documentary trail&quot; is short, but not nothing.
In fact, it looks just like Fletcher's. Why is that? Could it
be that they both were dramatic poets who spent a large part of
their working life writing for an acting company whose records didn't
survive?

The accepted theory is reasonably consistent with the presently
known facts. Given that we know so little about Shakespeare's
personal life, that theory is sketchy, but sketchy is not
at all the same thing as inconsistent. (The idea that if
Shakespeare was Shakespeare, his life wouldn't be sketchy
is common among anti-Stratfordians, but I see no reason
to expect that it is true. There were plenty of influential
Elizabethans whose lives are now mostly a mystery.)

It may be possible to come up with an alternative theory that
is also consistent with the facts, but so far, I haven't seen
any alternative that doesn't use an entirely theoretical(ie.
invisible) conspiracy to explain away inconvenient facts.
(Obviously, I find that completely unsatisfactory.)

The burden of proof is extremely high for anyone who wishes
to overturn the orthodoxy here. None of Shakespeare's
contemporaries are on record disputing the theory.
Generations passed before anyone disputed the theory.
Given that many of them had personal knowledge of theater
professionals(or in some cases, were themselves theater
professionals), we should not easily dismiss what they said
they thought they knew. (Nor should we, without strong
evidence, dismiss their testimony as if they were known
liars.)

In any case it does not follow from the fact that a man is a miser that
he cannot be a great poet:

&quot;Such as make it their business to oversee human actions, do not find
themselves in anything so much perplexed as to reconcile them and bring
them into the world's eye with the same lustre and reputation; for they
commonly so strangely contradict one another that it seems impossible
they should proceed from one and the same person. We find the younger
Marius one while a son of Mars and another a son of Venus. Pope
Boniface VIII. entered, it is said, into his Papacy like a fox, behaved
himself in it like a lion, and died like a dog; and who could believe it
to be the same Nero, the perfect image of all cruelty, who, having the
sentence of a condemned man brought to him to sign, as was the custom,
cried out, &quot;O that I had never been taught to write!&quot; so much it went to
his heart to condemn a man to death....

I give to my soul sometimes one face and sometimes another, according to
the side I turn her to. If I speak variously of myself, it is because I
consider myself variously; all the contrarieties are there
to be found in one corner or another; after one fashion or another:
bashful, insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious,
delicate; ingenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true; knowing,
ignorant; liberal, covetous, and prodigal: I find all this in myself,
more or less, according as I turn myself about; and whoever will sift
himself to the bottom, will find in himself, and even in his own
judgment, this volubility and discordance...&quot; (Montaigne, Of the

Which is odd, for as I recall the scholary consensus is that there is
more evidence for the authorship of shakespeare of stratford than just
about any other elizabethan writer. Some of that evidence is in the form
of legal records and the like- but still we have the evidence such as
Meres (1598):

&quot;As the soul of Euphorbus was thought to live in Pythagoras:
so the sweete wittie soul of Ovid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued
Shakespeare, witness his Venus and Adonis, his Lucrece, his sugared
Sonnets among his private friends...&quot;

and Weever (1599):

Honey-tongued Shakespeare, when I saw thine issue
I swore Apollo got them, and none other,
Their rosy-tainted features clothed in tissue,
Some heaven-born goddess said to be their mother.
Rose-cheekt Adonis with his amber tresses,
Fair fire-hot Venus charming him to love her,
Chaste Lucretia virgine-like her dresses,
Proud lust-stung Tarquine seeking still to prove her:
Romea-Richard; more, whose names I know not,
Their sugred tongues, and power attractive beauty
Say they are Saints, although that Sts they show not
For thousands vows to them subjective dutie:
They burn in love thy childre Shakespear het the
Go, wo thy Muse more Nymphish brood beget them.

Using direct and indirect evidence as proof of a fact is not groundless
assertion; OTOH claiming that some writer other than shakespeare wrote
the shakespeare canon and it was covered up by an evidenceless
conspiracy is a groundless assertion (and in fact leads to indeterminacy
for the reason that once the evidence for shakespeare is excluded there
is not one claim to the authorship of the shakespeare canon that is not
unconstestable).

&gt; If only that were true for dramatists of the Elizabethan/Jacobean
&gt; era.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this case we are dealing with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; national poet.

&gt; It's true that some people of that era considered him to be England's
&gt; best poet, but unless you have some evidence that Elizabethans attempted
&gt; to collect the letters and private papers of contemporary poets and put
&gt; them into the sorts of archives that have typically survived to the
&gt; present, that really doesn't mean anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What puzzled James Wilmot was that NOTHING WHATSOEVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had been conserved of William Shakspere ANYWHERE IN WARWICKSHIRE by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ANYONE.

&gt; Wilmot, if he expected to find much, probably believed that lots of people
&gt; in Shakespeare's day made efforts to collect mementos of notable
&gt; dramatists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It also puzzled Mark Twain, Henry James, Daphne du Maurier and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others of that kind who, like Wilmot, found reasons not to take the

No.

&gt;&gt; Don't be ridiculous. There is no end of the story just because you say
&gt;&gt; so. Don't forget the facts we have about Shakespeare, his miserly
&gt;&gt; lawsuits, the signatures of his daughters suggesting illiteracy, his
&gt;&gt; own handwriting in signatures suggesting he could barely write,

&gt; It is a fact that we have some documents from a few lawsuits.
&gt; The idea that they were &quot;miserly&quot; is not a fact, it's an
&gt; opinion. The idea that a great author would never, after
&gt; getting stiffed, resort to the courts is also just an opinion.

&gt; It is a fact that we have two marks and no signatures from
&gt; Judith's hand. It is a fact that we have a signature from
&gt; the hand of Susanna. If we go by the expert consensus, Judith
&gt; was *possibly* completely illiterate and Susanna was probably
&gt; completely literate. In short, Judith's state of literacy appears
&gt; to be about average for the daughter of someone of Shakespeare's
&gt; social class. Susanna's level of literacy would appear to
&gt; be somewhat unusual. Why should we expect anything different?
&gt; Have you found some evidence that suggests that the daughters
&gt; of commoner Elizabethan writers were usually educated above
&gt; their station? If not then what you have is an opinion
&gt; about facts.

"/>

This has been dealt with before. Documents show that ladies of
Elizabethan society generally were better educated than most people are
today. If you want to, I can quote Cockburn on this issue. You might
even find somehting of that sort here on hlas.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, several of Shakespeare's surviving signatures appear
&gt; to have been very badly executed. However, very few(if any)
&gt; experts in Elizabethan paleography appear to believe that
&gt; poorly executed signatures are a reliable indicators for
&gt; illiteracy.

&gt;&gt; and so
&gt;&gt; on. A few years ago Pat Dooley made a thorough research the results of
&gt;&gt; which he published here about the actually remaining proofs of the
&gt;&gt; authorship of Elizabethans.

&gt; I was very much a part of that discussion here on hlas. As
&gt; I recall, Pat's research with few exceptions, consisted of
&gt; attempts to defend Diana Price's work. (One exception was
&gt; his venture into regression analysis, which I'm guessing
&gt; he'd probably rather forget.)

&gt;&gt; Everyone was on the plus side except
&gt;&gt; Shakspere, who had nothing.

&gt; Diana Price picked arbitrary standards and then applied them
&gt; inconsistently to a poorly chosen group of writers. (For
&gt; example, she seems to have thought that it was reasonable
&gt; to compare Shakespeare's documentary life to that of William
&gt; Drummond, a man who happens to have been a Scottish Laird.)
&gt; As I pointed out at the time, if we drop her arbitrarily chosen
&gt; standard for contemporary notice(which seens to have been
&gt; selected just so she could exclude some records for Shakespeare)
&gt; and apply the rest of the standards evenly(arbitrary though they
&gt; be), Shakespeare's &quot;documentary trail&quot; is short, but not nothing.
&gt; In fact, it looks just like Fletcher's. Why is that? Could it
&gt; be that they both were dramatic poets who spent a large part of
&gt; their working life writing for an acting company whose records didn't
&gt; survive?

I didn't pay much heed to Diana Price while I found Dooley's impartial
research results interesting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Of course we have to take into account the
&gt;&gt; occurrence of accidents, fires, self-destructiveness, and so on, like
&gt;&gt; Stratfordians also have to take into account the actual alternative
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare theories that exist and which are not groundless.

&gt; The accepted theory is reasonably consistent with the presently
&gt; known facts. Given that we know so little about Shakespeare's
&gt; personal life, that theory is sketchy, but sketchy is not
&gt; at all the same thing as inconsistent. (The idea that if
&gt; Shakespeare was Shakespeare, his life wouldn't be sketchy
&gt; is common among anti-Stratfordians, but I see no reason
&gt; to expect that it is true. There were plenty of influential
&gt; Elizabethans whose lives are now mostly a mystery.)

&gt; It may be possible to come up with an alternative theory that
&gt; is also consistent with the facts, but so far, I haven't seen
&gt; any alternative that doesn't use an entirely theoretical(ie.
&gt; invisible) conspiracy to explain away inconvenient facts.
&gt; (Obviously, I find that completely unsatisfactory.)

&gt; The burden of proof is extremely high for anyone who wishes
&gt; to overturn the orthodoxy here. None of Shakespeare's
&gt; contemporaries are on record disputing the theory.
&gt; Generations passed before anyone disputed the theory.
&gt; Given that many of them had personal knowledge of theater
&gt; professionals(or in some cases, were themselves theater
&gt; professionals), we should not easily dismiss what they said
&gt; they thought they knew. (Nor should we, without strong
&gt; evidence, dismiss their testimony as if they were known
&gt; liars.)

I basically agree with you, and I am actually grateful to receive a
sensible post from a Stratfordian for a change. There was never any
reason to doubt Shakspere as an actor, his prominence and influence as
such, his ability as a theatre producer and businessman. However, there
are problems about his authorship. Already Doctor Johnson was worried
about the lack of anything binding Shakspere to the authorship in his
name, and before him no one ever associated Greene's disdain of &quot;the
only Shake-Scene&quot; with Shakespeare. The possibility to make that
association was Doctor Johnson's discovery, and he was so very pleased
with it so as to be tempted to establish it as 'evidence'. Maybe that's
where the cult business started.

Another evidence is the two versions of 'Othello', both published after
Shakspere's death and inconsistent with each other: someone made
alterations and additions. There are also additions to other
Shakespeare plays after his death, for instance Hamlet. One must ask
who had the authority to make alterations and additions if not the
author. There are also problems as to what is Marlowe and what is
Shakespeare in early Shakespeare. In &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; additions
were made long after Thomas Kyd's death with no author's name to them.
Ben Jonson has been suspected, but they are not in Jonson's style but
rather true to Thomas Kyd, as if made by someone intimately connected
with the play from the beginning. Another problem is the 'Shakespere'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare but found no material for it in reality. That's why the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results made him the first Baconian - there was no other alternative in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those days. Marlowe, Derby, Oxford and others were &quot;discovered&quot; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; less than 90 years later on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John Bede&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You do grasp the point that (why, Lord, why do I try?) Wilmot &quot;combed&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warwickshire more than one hundred years after Shakespeare died, long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after anyone who knew Shakespeare, or even Shakespeare's children, was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead? Even Shakespeare's grandchildren were dead by the time Wilmot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got his bright idea. You get that, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Andy,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In England it's practically impossible, if you are a man of letters,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not to leave anything written behind, which mementos invariably are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preserved by following generations.

&gt;&gt; If only that were true for dramatists of the Elizabethan/Jacobean
&gt;&gt; era.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this case we are dealing with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; national poet.

&gt;&gt; It's true that some people of that era considered him to be England's
&gt;&gt; best poet, but unless you have some evidence that Elizabethans attempted
&gt;&gt; to collect the letters and private papers of contemporary poets and put
&gt;&gt; them into the sorts of archives that have typically survived to the
&gt;&gt; present, that really doesn't mean anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What puzzled James Wilmot was that NOTHING WHATSOEVER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had been conserved of William Shakspere ANYWHERE IN WARWICKSHIRE by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ANYONE.

&gt;&gt; Wilmot, if he expected to find much, probably believed that lots of people
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's day made efforts to collect mementos of notable
&gt;&gt; dramatists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It also puzzled Mark Twain, Henry James, Daphne du Maurier and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others of that kind who, like Wilmot, found reasons not to take the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford cult seriously.

&gt;&gt; Is this a claim that Twain, James, and du Maurier were experts in
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan literature and history?

&gt; No.

&gt; If not, then why should
&gt;&gt; we give any weight to their evaluations of evidence.

&gt; Only because they were thinking persons looking deeper into literature
&gt; than just the surface. They should have understood more about
&gt; literature than people who don't write much.

"/>

??? By this &quot;logic,&quot; we should also give greater weight to the
opinions of the countless other great writers who &quot;understood more about
literature than people who don't write much,&quot; the vast majority of whom
accept the attribution of the Shakespeare canon to William Shakespeare
of Stratford, the actor and shareholder in the company that staged his
plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; History is a contingent not an apodictic science. What needs to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; examined are the facts, not your a priori assertions as to what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'invariably' the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not unheard of for men of letters to burn their personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documents, nor for documents to be destoyed by fire (recall the globe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fire, the fire of london), nor for documents to be mistakenly destoyed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (as was one of marlowes plays) or thrown out. Furthermore, it might be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; observed that hardly anything in the hand of *any* elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playwright has survived. Why should shakespeare by any different to his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporaries? He shouldn't. End of story.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't be ridiculous. There is no end of the story just because you say
&gt;&gt;&gt; so. Don't forget the facts we have about Shakespeare, his miserly
&gt;&gt;&gt; lawsuits, the signatures of his daughters suggesting illiteracy, his
&gt;&gt;&gt; own handwriting in signatures suggesting he could barely write,

&gt;&gt; It is a fact that we have some documents from a few lawsuits.
&gt;&gt; The idea that they were &quot;miserly&quot; is not a fact, it's an
&gt;&gt; opinion. The idea that a great author would never, after
&gt;&gt; getting stiffed, resort to the courts is also just an opinion.

&gt;&gt; It is a fact that we have two marks and no signatures from
&gt;&gt; Judith's hand. It is a fact that we have a signature from
&gt;&gt; the hand of Susanna. If we go by the expert consensus, Judith
&gt;&gt; was *possibly* completely illiterate and Susanna was probably
&gt;&gt; completely literate. In short, Judith's state of literacy appears
&gt;&gt; to be about average for the daughter of someone of Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; social class. Susanna's level of literacy would appear to
&gt;&gt; be somewhat unusual. Why should we expect anything different?
&gt;&gt; Have you found some evidence that suggests that the daughters
&gt;&gt; of commoner Elizabethan writers were usually educated above
&gt;&gt; their station? If not then what you have is an opinion
&gt;&gt; about facts.
&gt; This has been dealt with before. Documents show

&quot;Documents show&quot;? This sounds like an Elizabeth Weird utterance.
Can you be more specific?

&gt; that ladies of
&gt; Elizabethan society generally were better educated than most people are
&gt; today. If you want to, I can quote Cockburn on this issue. You might
&gt; even find somehting of that sort here on hlas.

&gt;&gt; Yes, several of Shakespeare's surviving signatures appear
&gt;&gt; to have been very badly executed. However, very few(if any)
&gt;&gt; experts in Elizabethan paleography appear to believe that
&gt;&gt; poorly executed signatures are a reliable indicators for
&gt;&gt; illiteracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and so
&gt;&gt;&gt; on. A few years ago Pat Dooley made a thorough research the results of
&gt;&gt;&gt; which he published here about the actually remaining proofs of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship of Elizabethans.

&gt;&gt; I was very much a part of that discussion here on hlas. As
&gt;&gt; I recall, Pat's research with few exceptions, consisted of
&gt;&gt; attempts to defend Diana Price's work. (One exception was
&gt;&gt; his venture into regression analysis, which I'm guessing
&gt;&gt; he'd probably rather forget.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Everyone was on the plus side except
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakspere, who had nothing.

&gt;&gt; Diana Price picked arbitrary standards and then applied them
&gt;&gt; inconsistently to a poorly chosen group of writers. (For
&gt;&gt; example, she seems to have thought that it was reasonable
&gt;&gt; to compare Shakespeare's documentary life to that of William
&gt;&gt; Drummond, a man who happens to have been a Scottish Laird.)
&gt;&gt; As I pointed out at the time, if we drop her arbitrarily chosen
&gt;&gt; standard for contemporary notice(which seens to have been
&gt;&gt; selected just so she could exclude some records for Shakespeare)
&gt;&gt; and apply the rest of the standards evenly(arbitrary though they
&gt;&gt; be), Shakespeare's &quot;documentary trail&quot; is short, but not nothing.
&gt;&gt; In fact, it looks just like Fletcher's. Why is that? Could it
&gt;&gt; be that they both were dramatic poets who spent a large part of
&gt;&gt; their working life writing for an acting company whose records didn't
&gt;&gt; survive?

&gt; I didn't pay much heed to Diana Price while I found Dooley's impartial
&gt; research results interesting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course we have to take into account the
&gt;&gt;&gt; occurrence of accidents, fires, self-destructiveness, and so on, like
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians also have to take into account the actual alternative
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare theories that exist and which are not groundless.

&gt;&gt; The accepted theory is reasonably consistent with the presently
&gt;&gt; known facts. Given that we know so little about Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; personal life, that theory is sketchy, but sketchy is not
&gt;&gt; at all the same thing as inconsistent. (The idea that if
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare was Shakespeare, his life wouldn't be sketchy
&gt;&gt; is common among anti-Stratfordians, but I see no reason
&gt;&gt; to expect that it is true. There were plenty of influential
&gt;&gt; Elizabethans whose lives are now mostly a mystery.)

&gt;&gt; It may be possible to come up with an alternative theory that
&gt;&gt; is also consistent with the facts, but so far, I haven't seen
&gt;&gt; any alternative that doesn't use an entirely theoretical(ie.
&gt;&gt; invisible) conspiracy to explain away inconvenient facts.
&gt;&gt; (Obviously, I find that completely unsatisfactory.)

&gt;&gt; The burden of proof is extremely high for anyone who wishes
&gt;&gt; to overturn the orthodoxy here. None of Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; contemporaries are on record disputing the theory.
&gt;&gt; Generations passed before anyone disputed the theory.
&gt;&gt; Given that many of them had personal knowledge of theater
&gt;&gt; professionals(or in some cases, were themselves theater
&gt;&gt; professionals), we should not easily dismiss what they said
&gt;&gt; they thought they knew. (Nor should we, without strong
&gt;&gt; evidence, dismiss their testimony as if they were known
&gt;&gt; liars.)

&gt;&gt; Rob

&gt; I basically agree with you, and I am actually grateful to receive a
&gt; sensible post from a Stratfordian for a change. There was never any
&gt; reason to doubt Shakspere as an actor, his prominence and influence as
&gt; such, his ability as a theatre producer and businessman. However, there
&gt; are problems about his authorship. Already Doctor Johnson was worried
&gt; about the lack of anything binding Shakspere to the authorship in his
&gt; name, and before him no one ever associated Greene's disdain of &quot;the
&gt; only Shake-Scene&quot; with Shakespeare. The possibility to make that

It's perfectly possible that Shakespeare himself revised some texts during
the - what? - six years between the likely date for the last completed play
and his death. If his plays were revived after his death, there may have
been literally &quot;unauthorised&quot; cuts and additions to suit particular
circumstances: the possibly-Middleton bits of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, for instance. We
have no idea of what manuscripts were available or what state they were in,
or whether each was the author's original or a neat working copy. If the
compilers of the Folio were working from theatre copies, which seems very
likely since they were working in London, many variations on the original
would inevitably get through. His former colleagues clearly honoured him,
but they need not have regarded the precise letter of the texts as
sacrosanct, or have had the scholarly expertise to compare and weigh up
every variant reading in so large a body of work.

Yes, Samuel Johnson, who considered &quot;Cymbeline&quot; silly. He did not
question the authorship. I only said he was unhappy about the absence
of concrete evidence, which was why he found some pleasure in the

Nigel Cockburn:

&quot;According to Carroll Camden in &quot;The Elizabethan Woman&quot; (1952) page 47,
Richard Mulcaster (1530-1611) stated: &quot;It is the custom of the country
for English girls to receive formal education beyond the elementary,
and it is the duty of parents to educate them.&quot; Early in the 16th
century intellectual pursuits became very fashionable, even for young
middle class women.&quot;
Shake-Speare in his plays oftentimes depicts intelligent, educated
young women. Would he not then have wanted his own daughters to have
&quot;the Wing wherewith we fly to Heaven&quot;? He was already affluent by 1594,
when his girls were still small, so he would have had no
difficulty in granting them even an expensive education. Even if he
frequently left his responsibilities in Stratford to be active in
London, he returned equally frequently and according to some spent his
summers there and after his retirement made his daughters
the principle beneficiaries of his will. The only explanation to his
daughters' lack of education is that he neglected it because as a
businessman he set little store by learning. If that was his reason,
he was not Shake-Speare.&quot;

From Greene's Groatsworth of Wit Bought with a Million of Repentance (1592):

Base minded men all three of you, if by my miserie you be not warnd: for
vnto none of you (like mee) sought those burres to cleaue: those Puppets (I
meane) that spake from our mouths, those Anticks garnisht in our colours. Is
it not strange, that I, to whom they all haue beene beholding: is it not
like that you, to whome they all haue beene beholding, shall (were yee in
that case as I am now) bee both at once of them forsaken? Yes trust them
not: for there is an vpstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with
his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to
bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and beeing an absolute
Iohannes fac totum, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a
countrey. O that I might intreat your rare wits to be imploied in more
profitable courses: &amp; let those Apes imitate your past excellence, and neuer
more acquaint them with your admired inuentions. I knowe the best husband of
you all will neuer proue an Vsurer, and the kindest of them all will neuer
proue a kind nurse: yet whilest you may, seeke you better Maisters; for it
is pittie men of such rare wits, should be subject to the pleasure of such
rude groomes.
In this I might insert two more, that both haue writ against these buckram
Gentlemen: but lette their owne workes serue to witnesse against their owne
wickednesse, it they perseuere to maintaine any more such peasants. For
other new-commers, I leaue them to the mercie of these painted monsters, who
(I doubt not) will driue the best minded to despise them: for the rest, it
skils not though they make a ieast at them.

From *Shakespeare's Circle* by Charles Nicholl, from the Penguin Shakespeare
Web site:

The target of this broadside was the twenty eight year old William
Shakespeare - signalled both by the punning name 'Shakescene', and by the
parody of a line from his Henry VI Part 3, 'O tiger's heart wrapped in a
woman's hide'. The passage was probably written in the summer of 1592
(Greene died on 3 September). It is the earliest certain allusion to
Shakespeare as a writer, though clearly he had already achieved some success
in the field: this is implied by Greene's pique, and is corroborated by the
1592 account books of Philip Henslowe, impresario of the Rose theatre, which
record high takings for 'harey the vi', almost certainly Henry VI Part 1.

The description of Shakespeare as a 'crow' carries two meanings. It refers
to him as an actor - one who merely mimics the words of others, as a crow
does - but it has also a graver imputation of plagiarism. It echoes the
Roman poet Horace's image of a plagiarizing poet as a 'little crow' decked
with 'stolen colours'. The scholarly Greene, who adorned his title pages
with Horatian tags, would certainly have known this passage from one of
Horace's Epistles. It was probably this slur which prompted Shakespeare to
remonstrate with the hack-author Henry Chettle, who had edited the
Groatsworth from Greene's fragmentary manuscripts. In his own pamphlet,
Kind-heart's Dream, published at the end of the year, Chettle duly
apologized:

I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself
have seen his demeanour no less civil than he excellent in the quality he
professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of
dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing, which
approves his art.

I'm glad you agree. Jonson also talks about Shakespeare as a writer in
Timber: Or Discoveries:

I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare,
that in his writing, (whatsoever he penn'd) hee never blotted out line. My
answer hath beene, Would he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought a
malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this, but for their ignorance,
who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by, wherein he most
faulted. And to justifie mine owne candor, (for I lov'd the man, and doe
honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any.) Hee was (indeed)
honest, and of an open, and free nature : had an excellent Phantsie ; brave
notions, and gentle expressions : wherein hee flow'd with that facility,
that sometime it was necessary he should be stop'd : Sufflaminandus erat ;
as Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his owne power ; would the rule
of it had beene so too. Many times hee fell into those things, could not
escape laughter : As when hee said in the person of Caesar, one speaking to
him ; Caesar, thou dost me wrong. Hee replyed : Caesar did never wrong, but
with just cause : and such like ; which were ridiculous. But hee redeemed
his vices, with his vertues. There was ever more in him to be praysed, then
to be pardoned.

He also talked about Shakespeare (as well as other writers) to the Scottish
poet, William Drummond, who wrote down in his diary as much of Jonson's
conversation as he could remember:

He said Shakespeare wanted art and sometimes sense, for in one of his plays

In 1612 William Jaggard brought out a new edition of &quot;The Passionate
Pilgrime Or Certaine Amorous Sonnets, betweene Venus and Adonis, newly
corrected and augmented. By W. Shakespeare.&quot; Jaggard included two poems from
Thomas Heywood's Troia Britannica. Jaggard did not consult Heywood or give
him credit for the poems, which pissed off Heywood. In 1612, in an epistle
to Nicholas Oakes, the printer, at the end of An Apology for Actors, Heywood
said Shakespeare was also pissed off:

Here likewise, I must necessarily insert a manifest injury done me in that
worke, by taking the two Epistles of Paris to Helen, and Helen to Paris, and
printing them in a lesse volume, vnder the name of another, which may put
the world in opinion I might steale them from him; and hee to doe himselfe
right, hath since published them in his own name: but as I must acknowledge
my lines not worthy his patronage, vnder whom he hath publisht them, so the
Author I know much offended with M. Iaggard (that altogether unknowne to

It is possible that he knew more than he was
in a position to admit. He visited Stratford-

staying at The Swan in the town. But he
did not bother to walk to the church, nor
pay respects at the grave of 'The Author'.

Or he may merely have suspected. There is,
and was, no tradition of 'the great and the
good' visiting the Stratford grave for such a
purpose -- a fact which does not fit the usual
English practice, as seen in Poet's Corner in
Westminster Abbey, and generally in the
Kingdom.

Stratford remains the province of the
ignorant tourist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George Buc, Master of the Revels

&gt;&gt; He clearly states Shakespeare is a playwright.

&gt; How on earth do you come to this conclusion?

Well sure, if you want to know who wrote a play, who better to ask than a
cleaner or horse holder?

You're not making any sense. You can't even be consistent between sentences,

&quot;Teste&quot; doesn't mean &quot;said.&quot;&quot;Teste&quot; means by his witness or his evidence.
And Shakespeare also gave him more detail than who he thought wrote it.

&gt;&gt; The Folger Shakespeare Library copy of George a Greene contains two

&gt;&gt; The inscriptions clearly reveal that George Buc knew Shakespeare

&gt;&gt; and considered him a reliable informant on the authorship of George a

You really are thick, aren't you?

This is evidence Buc knew Shakespeare was a playwright.

If you had ever researched Stationers entries (which I know you haven't,
since you prefer to make things up), you would have seen that each entry
tells which registry employee handled the transaction (&quot;under the hands&quot; of
&quot;thands).

For instance, the registration for *Shrew* was entered in 1594 by Master
Warden Cawoodes. The registration was transferred in January 1607 by Master
Burby, and later that same year transferred again, this time &quot;vnder thandes
of the wardens,&quot; no particular one named.

*Titus* was entered in 1594 &quot;vnder thandes of bothe the wardens.&quot; R3 in 1597
under Master Barlowe and Master Warden Man. Masters Dix and Man both entered
1H4 in 1598.

This particular entry for *Lear* was entered by Buc personally as well as
the wardens, which indicates he knew Shakespeare was a playwright. He even
makes a reference to Shakespeare's social status as a gentleman, &quot;Master,&quot;
which survives on the title pages of Q1 and Q2 as &quot;M.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I have, once again (I did it several years ago), garbled the process of
registration.

From 1606 to 1612 Sir George Buc was granted the sole right to authorize
plays for publication. Either he or one of his deputies would read a play
and determine whether it could be published. If approved, the play would
then go to the Stationers Registry, where one of the masters or wardens
would license the play for publication based upon the approval of Buc or one
of his deputies. &quot;Under the hands of&quot; refers to the signatures of the
persons who authorized publication, who would sign the play as proof of
authorization.

So in the case of *Lear,* Buc had read the play, approved it for
publication, and signed the copy. the publisher then took it to the
Stationers Hall, where the wardens checked to see if the play had been
registered by anyone else and who then signed it as authorization for
publication.

Sorry about the mix-up, but it's complicated (to me, anyway) and I was
working from memory for the most part, and so reverted back to the garbled
understanding I had of the process years ago.

My point still stands: Buc knew Shakespeare as a playwright, as indicated by
the registry entry, and the inscription in his hand on *George a Green*
indicates he knew Shakespeare personally, asking for his opinion on the
authorship of an obscure and anonymous play.

Re. the following:

Greene identifies Shakespeare by his pun on the name &quot;Shakescene&quot; (you
claim to be an expert on puns on Shakespeare's name; can't you
recognize the stagereference in this one?),

Comment:

In Shakespeare Myth, the concept of Shakescene, 8600, concerns mythical
Hieros Gamos, 5902, whereby a seed of Light, 1000, is planted in
'barren land', with 'Tygers hart wrapt in a players hyde', 16160, being
the 'first heire' of Male/Female Creator's 'inuention'. In the
fullness of time, the 'seed' becomes 'barren-land-ending' Flaming
Sword, 4000.

The Myth's Cipher Sum , 8600 + 5902 + 1000 + 16160 + 4000 = 35662, is
'documented' in First Heire's 'baptism' and 'burial', as in 17252 +
2602 + 1564 + 10026 + 2502 + 1616 + 100 = 35662, where

17252 = Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere

2602 = April 26

1564 = 1564

&gt;&gt; Congratulations, John, that you have raised the Stratford dogs and
&gt;&gt; gathered them at your heels. Let's see what they can do about a
&gt;&gt;&quot;fucking bitch&quot;, as I was last called by one of them. Maybe he'll turn
&gt;&gt; up again - he always does whenever I appear.

&gt;&gt; You are right that all the bores here come from Stratford. Whatever you
&gt;&gt; may think about various manifestations of Oxfordian folly, at least you
&gt;&gt; never find them boring. Remember the command of the Master Noel Coward:
&gt;&gt;&quot;You can do anything in the theatre except be a bore.&quot;

&gt; Yet another incoherent argument: history is too boring to be true.

I never said that.

I like

&gt; that one. It's so ... so ... --well, I was going to say stupid, but I'll be
&gt; PC and just say it's so typical of antiStratfordians.

&gt;&gt; And don't worry about those dogs. I am used to hopelessly ignorant
&gt;&gt; school-children. Just dish them.

&gt; School children are supposed to be ignorant. Only incompetent teachers would

This is typical of you stratfordians. You are just like old testament
Christian fundamentalists, like Jehova's Wtnesses, sticking so blindly
to the written word, taking it for the untouchable literal truth, so as
to obliterate all other possibilities from your mind, twisting the
alternative words of others into meanings suitable to your prejudice,
so that you can ban them. So the fact that Laila finds most of you
stratfordians here 'boring' you twist into that everything true must be
'boring' to them, so all history must to them be a 'bore'. What a state
of mind your poor brainwashed stratfordians are in!

My primary reaction to your intrusion here, Tom, was that you obviously
hadn't read anything of what had been discussed in this thread before
you broke in, trying to teach us the facts of Shakespeare that already
had been disposed of earlier. Here, for instance, is what I said about
&quot;Shake-Scene&quot;:

&quot;Already Doctor Johnson was worried about the lack of anything binding
Shakspere to the authorship in his name, and before him NO ONE EVER
ASSOCIATED GREENE'S DISDAIN OF 'THE ONLY SHAKE-SCENE' WITH SHAKESPEARE.
The possibility to make that association was Doctor Johnson's
discovery, and he was so very pleased with it so as to be tempted to
establish it as 'evidence'. Maybe that's where the cult business
started.&quot;

The rest of your quite common 'stratfordian evidence' has been disposed
of by Paul Crowley, whose arguments you haven't answered, like
stratfordians never answer critical arguments, as if it was impossible
for them to tolerate any kind of doubt in Shakspere at all, as if any
word against the Stratford Icon were anathema.

Also you haven't answered the basic critical argument against
stratfordianism, the argument that started off Baconianism, rev.
Wilmot's reasonable doubt that Shakspere from Stratford impossibly
could know about what intimately went on at the court of Henry of
Navarre down south of Montauban. Only one person in this context was an
intimate witness to the private affairs of Henry of Navarre, and he had
reasons to be, since king Henry at one instant saved his life. As I
said earlier, Derby could also have been there, but Derby had no
intimate connection with Henry nor any reason to engage in his internal
affairs. Francis Bacon was probably also there, but also he did not
have the same very intimate connection with Henry as his brother
Anthony had. I think it was in 1587 when Anthony was prosecuted in
France for having had an affair with a page. He was accused of
homosexuality, and the punishment was to be burned at the stake. King
Henry saved his life and interrupted the court proceedings, for which
Anthony remained grateful to king Henry for the rest of his life.

It has never been proved that Anthony was a homosexual, like it never
has been proved that Francis was so either. They had a very dominating
mother, who was disturbingly over-ambitious for her sons, which partly
may have ruined their characters and made them allergic to raise
families themselves. So all that crap about Bacon being a bastard son
of Queen Elizabeth, so desperately blazoned out by disturbed baconians,
is bullshit.

However, the question of homosexuality is imminent here, since also
Aubrey accuses Francis of homosexuality. No documents or testimonies
indicate that either of them ever 'buggered'. They were found caressing
lads occasionally, but any person may caress another person without
being incriminated for it. That's a very innocent and natural
expression of affection and nothing else. Anthony was sickly all his
life, both brothers were clearly over-sensitive, so that Anthony,
although being in the service of the Queen, never could bear seeing
her.

Anthony became the chief intelligence officer in London after
Walsingham, who died 1590. Anthony returned from France to London in
1592 and started working for Essex, whom he served until the end with
affectionate loyalty. Facts indicate there were two loves in the life
of Anthony Bacon: Henry of Navarre and Essex, and both loves were just
the highest form of friendship. When Essex broke down after 1598,
Anthony did the same, he could not survive the traumatic national
crisis of Essex' downfall (manifested in literature in the 'Hamlet
crisis'), and shortly after Essex' death also Anthony died on May 17th
1601, which was only discovered recently (30 years back). We still
don't know why he died, but suicide is indicated. He knew all about his
brother Francis' implications in the fall of Essex, which probably must
have broken his heart.

Now, what has all this to do with Shakespeare? Everything. The Bacon
case is parallel to the Shakespeare case all the way. The brothers
Bacon were born in the hub of things around Queen Elizabeth, the
Sidneys, the Walsinghams, the Free-Thinkers, science, literature,
poetry, they learned to write sonnets in France, Anthony sent a number
of his sonnets over to Francis from France, sonnets which never have
been identified. Both were at the core of English history as it was
shaped while they lived - the rise of Henry of Navarre as Europé's
most important monarch together with Queen Elizabeth, the Netherlands
crisis with the murder of William the Silent, the Essex and Raleigh
successful raid against Cadiz, they were both in the middle of it from
beginning to end, and Southampton and Rutland were with them. The
Derbys were related with them as were Oxford, who was also known to be
bisexual like most theatre partners, and the Bacons even had dealings
with Stratford: Nicholas Bacon, their father, had a lawsuit with John
Shakespeare of Stratford through the father of Richard Burbage. Back in
London, Anthony lived in Bishopsgate close to the very theatres that
saw the first Shakespeare plays. Anthony was connected with them from
the beginning, and Francis Bacon produced &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; at
Gray's Inn before Shakespeare.

There are lots to be investigated here. The springing points are, that
the Bacon brothers had all that educational basis for the Shakespeare
plays that Shakspere lacked, that Anthony Bacon was a perfect intimate
of the court life of Henry of Navarre before he became Henry IV of
France, Shakspere could have had no such insight, the Hamlet crisis is
simultaneous with the Essex crisis and probably a consequence thereof,
in which crisis both the Bacon brothers were as deep in as Shakspere
was totally without, the great tragedies start off with the death of
Anthony, the only intimate of Francis Bacon ever, after which death
Francis stands totally alone deserted in a desert of selfish intrigue
and mercilessly opportunistic politics, the despair of which he
expresses in plays like &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

I just try to give you an idea of what stratfordians are up against.
You have nothing to base the Shakspere case on except his possible
business contact with powerful men at court, namely Anthony and Francis
Bacon, who impossibly in their position could assume any responsibility
for the production of plays like &quot;Richard II&quot;. Queen Elizabeth actually
tried to bring Francis to account for its production, but he got away
with it.

&gt;&gt; stratfordians here 'boring' you twist into that everything true must be
&gt;&gt; 'boring' to them, so all history must to them be a 'bore'.

&gt; The same misinterpretation of simple English and the same putting words into
&gt; people's mouths while accusing others of doing the same.

&gt;&gt; What a state
&gt;&gt; of mind your poor brainwashed stratfordians are in!

&gt;&gt; My primary reaction to your intrusion here, Tom, was that you obviously
&gt;&gt; hadn't read anything of what had been discussed in this thread before
&gt;&gt; you broke in, trying to teach us the facts of Shakespeare that already
&gt;&gt; had been disposed of earlier. Here, for instance, is what I said about
&gt;&gt;&quot;Shake-Scene&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Already Doctor Johnson was worried about the lack of anything binding
&gt;&gt; Shakspere to the authorship in his name, and before him NO ONE EVER
&gt;&gt; ASSOCIATED GREENE'S DISDAIN OF 'THE ONLY SHAKE-SCENE' WITH SHAKESPEARE.
&gt;&gt; The possibility to make that association was Doctor Johnson's
&gt;&gt; discovery, and he was so very pleased with it so as to be tempted to
&gt;&gt; establish it as 'evidence'. Maybe that's where the cult business
&gt;&gt; started.&quot;

&gt; You put words in the mouth of Samuel Johnson. So what? Obviously you, like
&gt; Kaplan, think you can read the minds of dead people and interpret their
&gt; intentions.

&gt;&gt; The rest of your quite common 'stratfordian evidence' has been disposed
&gt;&gt; of by Paul Crowley,

&gt; Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; Excuse me, I have to wipe the tears from my eyes.

&gt; There, that's better.

&gt; I have to say we haven't seen such unintentional buffoonery around here
&gt; since Peter Zenner left.

&gt;&gt; whose arguments you haven't answered, like
&gt;&gt; stratfordians never answer critical arguments, as if it was impossible
&gt;&gt; for them to tolerate any kind of doubt in Shakspere at all, as if any
&gt;&gt; word against the Stratford Icon were anathema.

&gt; Yep. You're Ken Kaplan all right.

&gt;&gt; Also you haven't answered the basic critical argument against
&gt;&gt; stratfordianism, the argument that started off Baconianism, rev.
&gt;&gt; Wilmot's reasonable doubt that Shakspere from Stratford impossibly
&gt;&gt; could know about what intimately went on at the court of Henry of
&gt;&gt; Navarre down south of Montauban. Only one person in this context was an
&gt;&gt; intimate witness to the private affairs of Henry of Navarre, and he had
&gt;&gt; reasons to be, since king Henry at one instant saved his life. As I
&gt;&gt; said earlier, Derby could also have been there, but Derby had no
&gt;&gt; intimate connection with Henry nor any reason to engage in his internal
&gt;&gt; affairs. Francis Bacon was probably also there, but also he did not
&gt;&gt; have the same very intimate connection with Henry as his brother
&gt;&gt; Anthony had. I think it was in 1587 when Anthony was prosecuted in
&gt;&gt; France for having had an affair with a page. He was accused of
&gt;&gt; homosexuality, and the punishment was to be burned at the stake. King
&gt;&gt; Henry saved his life and interrupted the court proceedings, for which
&gt;&gt; Anthony remained grateful to king Henry for the rest of his life.

&gt; This is such Klassic Kaplan that I have to say, if you aren't him, you two
&gt; were identical twins who were separated at birth. I think you're him. either
&gt; that, or he wrote this for you.

&gt;&gt; It has never been proved that Anthony was a homosexual, like it never
&gt;&gt; has been proved that Francis was so either. They had a very dominating
&gt;&gt; mother, who was disturbingly over-ambitious for her sons, which partly
&gt;&gt; may have ruined their characters and made them allergic to raise
&gt;&gt; families themselves. So all that crap about Bacon being a bastard son
&gt;&gt; of Queen Elizabeth, so desperately blazoned out by disturbed baconians,
&gt;&gt; is bullshit.

&gt;&gt; However, the question of homosexuality is imminent here, since also
&gt;&gt; Aubrey accuses Francis of homosexuality. No documents or testimonies
&gt;&gt; indicate that either of them ever 'buggered'. They were found caressing
&gt;&gt; lads occasionally, but any person may caress another person without
&gt;&gt; being incriminated for it.

&gt; Now he's just getting creepy. But he's still displaying Klassic Kaplan
&gt; obsessions.

&gt;&gt; That's a very innocent and natural
&gt;&gt; expression of affection and nothing else.

&gt; Well of course. Men go around &quot;carassing lads&quot; all the time. Nothing wrong
&gt; with it at all. I see it on the streets all the time. It's the mark of true
&gt; masculinity.

&gt;&gt; Anthony was sickly all his
&gt;&gt; life, both brothers were clearly over-sensitive, so that Anthony,
&gt;&gt; although being in the service of the Queen, never could bear seeing
&gt; her.

&gt;&gt; Anthony became the chief intelligence officer in London after
&gt;&gt; Walsingham, who died 1590. Anthony returned from France to London in
&gt;&gt; 1592 and started working for Essex, whom he served until the end with
&gt;&gt; affectionate loyalty. Facts indicate there were two loves in the life
&gt;&gt; of Anthony Bacon: Henry of Navarre and Essex, and both loves were just
&gt;&gt; the highest form of friendship. When Essex broke down after 1598,
&gt;&gt; Anthony did the same, he could not survive the traumatic national
&gt;&gt; crisis of Essex' downfall (manifested in literature in the 'Hamlet
&gt;&gt; crisis'), and shortly after Essex' death also Anthony died on May 17th
&gt;&gt; 1601, which was only discovered recently (30 years back). We still
&gt;&gt; don't know why he died, but suicide is indicated. He knew all about his
&gt;&gt; brother Francis' implications in the fall of Essex, which probably must
&gt;&gt; have broken his heart.

&gt;&gt; Now, what has all this to do with Shakespeare? Everything. The Bacon
&gt;&gt; case is parallel to the Shakespeare case all the way. The brothers
&gt;&gt; Bacon were born in the hub of things around Queen Elizabeth, the
&gt;&gt; Sidneys, the Walsinghams, the Free-Thinkers, science, literature,
&gt;&gt; poetry, they learned to write sonnets in France, Anthony sent a number
&gt;&gt; of his sonnets over to Francis from France, sonnets which never have
&gt;&gt; been identified.

&gt; So how do you know they're his? Oh, I fogot. Just more Klassic Kaplan
&gt; English. You mean they're lost. Right?

&gt;&gt; Both were at the core of English history as it was
&gt;&gt; shaped while they lived

&gt; Both sonnets?

&gt;&gt; - the rise of Henry of Navarre as Europé's
&gt;&gt; most important monarch together with Queen Elizabeth, the Netherlands
&gt;&gt; crisis with the murder of William the Silent, the Essex and Raleigh
&gt;&gt; successful raid against Cadiz, they were both in the middle of it from
&gt;&gt; beginning to end, and Southampton and Rutland were with them. The
&gt;&gt; Derbys were related with them as were Oxford, who was also known to be
&gt;&gt; bisexual like most theatre partners,

&gt; Huh? Most theatre partners are bisexual? When did you do the study?

&gt;&gt; and the Bacons even had dealings
&gt;&gt; with Stratford: Nicholas Bacon, their father, had a lawsuit with John
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford through the father of Richard Burbage.

&gt; I don't think I've ever heard you put forth a more convincing argument for
&gt; authorship.

&gt;&gt; Back in
&gt;&gt; London, Anthony lived in Bishopsgate close to the very theatres that
&gt;&gt; saw the first Shakespeare plays. Anthony was connected with them from
&gt;&gt; the beginning, and Francis Bacon produced &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; at
&gt;&gt; Gray's Inn before Shakespeare.

&gt; Ken, you really need to lay off watching those soap operas.

&gt;&gt; There are lots to be investigated here. The springing points are, that
&gt;&gt; the Bacon brothers had all that educational basis for the Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; plays that Shakspere lacked, that Anthony Bacon was a perfect intimate
&gt;&gt; of the court life of Henry of Navarre before he became Henry IV of
&gt;&gt; France, Shakspere could have had no such insight, the Hamlet crisis is
&gt;&gt; simultaneous with the Essex crisis and probably a consequence thereof,
&gt;&gt; in which crisis both the Bacon brothers were as deep in as Shakspere
&gt;&gt; was totally without, the great tragedies start off with the death of
&gt;&gt; Anthony, the only intimate of Francis Bacon ever, after which death
&gt;&gt; Francis stands totally alone deserted in a desert of selfish intrigue
&gt;&gt; and mercilessly opportunistic politics, the despair of which he
&gt;&gt; expresses in plays like &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I just try to give you an idea of what stratfordians are up against.

&gt; I know what we're up against: People like you, which is why there's no cause
&gt; to worry that antiStratfordianism will ever become the mainstream belief
&gt; about Shakespeare.

Those stratfordians tend to confuse anyone with anyone. Another one
confused me with John Baker, although I am not even a marlite. They
just can't keep identities separated. If someone says something that
reminds you of something that was said by someone else once upon a
time, then it must be the same person. This highlights the stratfordian
sense of identification. They think they can pinpoint anyone like they
think they have pinpointed Shakespeare, who just can't be pinned down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons to be, since king Henry at one instant saved his life. As I
&gt;&gt;&gt; said earlier, Derby could also have been there, but Derby had no
&gt;&gt;&gt; intimate connection with Henry nor any reason to engage in his
&gt;&gt;&gt; internal
&gt;&gt;&gt; affairs. Francis Bacon was probably also there, but also he did not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have the same very intimate connection with Henry as his brother
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anthony had. I think it was in 1587 when Anthony was prosecuted in
&gt;&gt;&gt; France for having had an affair with a page. He was accused of
&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality, and the punishment was to be burned at the stake. King
&gt;&gt;&gt; Henry saved his life and interrupted the court proceedings, for which
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anthony remained grateful to king Henry for the rest of his life.

&gt;&gt; This is such Klassic Kaplan that I have to say, if you aren't him, you
&gt;&gt; two
&gt;&gt; were identical twins who were separated at birth. I think you're him.
&gt;&gt; either
&gt;&gt; that, or he wrote this for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It has never been proved that Anthony was a homosexual, like it never
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been proved that Francis was so either. They had a very dominating
&gt;&gt;&gt; mother, who was disturbingly over-ambitious for her sons, which partly
&gt;&gt;&gt; may have ruined their characters and made them allergic to raise
&gt;&gt;&gt; families themselves. So all that crap about Bacon being a bastard son
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Queen Elizabeth, so desperately blazoned out by disturbed
&gt;&gt;&gt; baconians,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is bullshit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, the question of homosexuality is imminent here, since also
&gt;&gt;&gt; Aubrey accuses Francis of homosexuality. No documents or testimonies
&gt;&gt;&gt; indicate that either of them ever 'buggered'. They were found
&gt;&gt;&gt; caressing
&gt;&gt;&gt; lads occasionally, but any person may caress another person without
&gt;&gt;&gt; being incriminated for it.

&gt;&gt; Now he's just getting creepy. But he's still displaying Klassic Kaplan
&gt;&gt; obsessions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a very innocent and natural
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression of affection and nothing else.

&gt;&gt; Well of course. Men go around &quot;carassing lads&quot; all the time. Nothing
&gt;&gt; wrong
&gt;&gt; with it at all. I see it on the streets all the time. It's the mark of
&gt;&gt; true
&gt;&gt; masculinity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anthony was sickly all his
&gt;&gt;&gt; life, both brothers were clearly over-sensitive, so that Anthony,
&gt;&gt;&gt; although being in the service of the Queen, never could bear seeing
&gt;&gt; her.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anthony became the chief intelligence officer in London after
&gt;&gt;&gt; Walsingham, who died 1590. Anthony returned from France to London in
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1592 and started working for Essex, whom he served until the end with
&gt;&gt;&gt; affectionate loyalty. Facts indicate there were two loves in the life
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Anthony Bacon: Henry of Navarre and Essex, and both loves were just
&gt;&gt;&gt; the highest form of friendship. When Essex broke down after 1598,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anthony did the same, he could not survive the traumatic national
&gt;&gt;&gt; crisis of Essex' downfall (manifested in literature in the 'Hamlet
&gt;&gt;&gt; crisis'), and shortly after Essex' death also Anthony died on May 17th
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1601, which was only discovered recently (30 years back). We still
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't know why he died, but suicide is indicated. He knew all about
&gt;&gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt;&gt; brother Francis' implications in the fall of Essex, which probably
&gt;&gt;&gt; must
&gt;&gt;&gt; have broken his heart.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, what has all this to do with Shakespeare? Everything. The Bacon
&gt;&gt;&gt; case is parallel to the Shakespeare case all the way. The brothers
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bacon were born in the hub of things around Queen Elizabeth, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sidneys, the Walsinghams, the Free-Thinkers, science, literature,
&gt;&gt;&gt; poetry, they learned to write sonnets in France, Anthony sent a number
&gt;&gt;&gt; of his sonnets over to Francis from France, sonnets which never have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been identified.

&gt;&gt; So how do you know they're his? Oh, I fogot. Just more Klassic Kaplan
&gt;&gt; English. You mean they're lost. Right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Both were at the core of English history as it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; shaped while they lived

&gt;&gt; Both sonnets?

&gt;&gt;&gt; - the rise of Henry of Navarre as Europé's
&gt;&gt;&gt; most important monarch together with Queen Elizabeth, the Netherlands
&gt;&gt;&gt; crisis with the murder of William the Silent, the Essex and Raleigh
&gt;&gt;&gt; successful raid against Cadiz, they were both in the middle of it from
&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning to end, and Southampton and Rutland were with them. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Derbys were related with them as were Oxford, who was also known to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; bisexual like most theatre partners,

&gt;&gt; Huh? Most theatre partners are bisexual? When did you do the study?

&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Bacons even had dealings
&gt;&gt;&gt; with Stratford: Nicholas Bacon, their father, had a lawsuit with John
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford through the father of Richard Burbage.

&gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever heard you put forth a more convincing argument
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; authorship.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Back in
&gt;&gt;&gt; London, Anthony lived in Bishopsgate close to the very theatres that
&gt;&gt;&gt; saw the first Shakespeare plays. Anthony was connected with them from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the beginning, and Francis

Yes, but there was a certain routine about them, they were glorious and
popular already in the 1580s, anyone identified himself with them and
what they contained, anybody would have liked to have written them, and
since no one really knew who had, (or at least that was a subject of
some uncertainty and speculation, all printed plays before 1594 having
no author,) and since some actual play-writers, like Oxford and Derby,
had reasons to keep mum about it and conceal themselves, (remember
Bacon's words about 'concealed poets', which certainly weren't news in
the 17th century, since, as I said, all playwrights were concealed up
to 1594,) and therefore would have had obvious need for somebody to act
as agent, wouldn't then first of all William Shakspere gladly have
accepted that office? And Ben Jonson too? And since Ben Jonson probably
also wrote some pieces that weren't his, (that is, lending his name to
them, since there were 'concealed poets',) wouldn't he have supported
the Shakespeare office? Wouldn't publication of their names have served
the wish of the 'concealed poets' to remain concealed and even better

Here you go again with your ridiculing nonsense. Of course one must
exclude the other, if one is certain. But here none is certain. IF it
was Derby, logic must reason that Oxford did some work before him,
which he continued. IF it was Shakspere, much speaks for that he
continued many works of Marlowe. IF it was Bacon, he could have helped

The formost idealist of the age was of course Bacon with his ardent
interest not only in philosophy, science, justice and politics but in
all things human, and his essay on poetry (the very first one)
qualifies him directly as the formost alternative Shakespeare
candidate. He has always been recognized as such since the beginning of
the authorship debate. One of the problems, however, is Marlowe. If we
accept the possibility that he survived his official death 30.5.1593,
like there is evidence that Christ survived his, he must rank as an
alternative Shakespeare candidate on the same level with Bacon.
Baconians, however, insist that Bacon wrote Marlowe. Aye, there's the
rub.

&gt; yours,

&gt; Christian

"/>

A tricky question. You compel me to some elaboration. Let's begin with
Oxford, the oldest member of the company. Here is a quote from myself:

&quot;Of course, it's out of the question that Oxford could have written
Shakespeare. However, it is quite possible, and even probable, that
Oxford did produce some interesting works for the theatre which Bacon
then probably edited, which could have contributed to the Shakespeare
canon. So Oxford can in no way be eliminated among the authors of the
Shakespeare works. &quot;

The next tricky person is Derby, intimately connected with Oxford. In
fact, much of the Oxford case rests on Derby, since Oxford died (as
everyone knows) ten years before the Shakespeare production of new
plays ceased. The only Derbyite around here is Laila, who bravely has
stood up for Derby at all times without flinching. Part of her case
rests on Honigmann, who tried to make a case for
Shakspere-in-Lancashire, since apparently there are obvious connections
with Shakespeare and northern England in dialectal words and references
to the Derby family. IF Shakspere could be connected with Lancashire,
the Stratfordians would have a case. Unfortunately for the
Stratfordians, only an unknown &quot;Shakeshafte&quot; with no certain links with
Stratford at all could be geographically bound with Lancashire. A
Marlovian claims he proved this &quot;Shakeshafte&quot; to be a local coastal
fellow. Derby is the most mysterious of the candidates since we know
least about him. Since his brother produced Marlowe, since both
brothers had theatre companies connected with Marlowe and Shakespeare,
since at least William Derby wrote plays (unknown) , since there also
is evidence that he was engaged in music och could write witty poetry,
since his notorious jealousy of his wife could have influenced
characters like Othello and Leontes, since (like Oxford) he was
intimately connected with Bacon all his life, since (by coincidence or
not) all the theatres of England closed on his death in September 1642,
and since a number of eminent international professors of literature
ascribe Shakespeare to him, he can in no way be eliminated from the
circle of probable co-authors of Shakespeare. Cockburn, who has
dedicated his life to solve the authorship question, gives Bacon a
complete case and Derby half a case, excluding Oxford, Marlowe and
Shakspere.

Bacon was of the same age as Derby (born 1561) and had business with
Derby all his life. The case for Bacon rests mainly on his &quot;Promus&quot;,
casual notes from 1594-95 presenting an astounding amount of
Shakespearisms at that time not yet published; on the perfect
coincidence of elements in Shakespeare referring to historical events
with major occurrencies in Bacon's life (the most perfect of which must
be deemed the fact that the Shakespeare production ceased
simultaneously as Bacon advanced to his top position of responsibility
in the British government); on the obvious likeness of the final &quot;King
Lear&quot; case with the strange case of Sir Brian Annesley, a high court
case which hardly could have been known to Oxford, Derby, Marlowe or
Shakspere, while Bacon was the jurist among them; on Bacon's intimate
knowledge of many things corresponding exactly with Shakespeare's
parallel expertise; and on other exclusive facts of Bacon's life
mirrored in Shakespeare. He can in no way be eliminated from the circle
of probable Shakespeare authors and editors.

You know more of the Marlowe case than I do, but there is obviously a
crystal clear case also for Marlowe as a man behind Shakespeare,
whether he survived his official death or not. Since it can't be
proved that he did or that he died, let's leave Deptford out of this
discussion. With Peter Farey I discussed the Stratford monument, which
he claimed was a riddle the answer of which was Marlowe. No definite
conclusion could be reached. What we know for sure is that Marlowe
developed the English drama up to the Shakespeare standard and that a
number of early Shakespeare plays were at least started and drafted by
Marlowe. The claim of Marlovians, that the probability that his death
was a set-up must lead to the conclusion that he continued writing as
Shakespeare, is in no way self-evident, since, if he survived and
continued writing, there still could be a number of co-authors.

Stratfordians claim that all evidence that exists proves Will Shakspere
from Stratford was the only possible author of Shakespeare. This is the
weakest case of all, since all that &quot;evidence&quot; is only superficial and
never final. What is certain is that Will Shakspere without doubt was
at the hub of things and at least the perfect co-ordinator, a technical
man who mastered his theatre business as no one else and made the
Shakespeare plays work. He can in no way be eliminated from the central
position in the Shakespeare productions as the practical doer. The
immense amount of work which his theatre business and acting in such
big plays in such a vast repertoire must have taken is however the
greatest argument against his possible Shakespeare authorship,
especially since there is nothing in his left writings (bills,
lawsuits, six poor signatures as of a man not used to write anything
else, no letters at all, not one single manuscript page and no books)
to indicate any such thing. His name was also published as the author
of spurious plays like &quot;Locrine&quot; and &quot;A London Prodigal&quot;, plays far
below the Shakespeare standard, which must add negatively to his
credibility. This would rather provide more material for the suspicion
that his name was used for publishing plays and poems by authors that
did not want to have their names published. Oxford, Derby and Bacon had
good reasons for concealing their names from publications of popular
works, while Marlowe's name after his scandalizations would have been
anathema to any publisher.

In brief, a case for each and every one of them but the weakest case
for Shakspere.

&gt; discussion. With Peter Farey I discussed the Stratford monument, which

&gt; conclusion could be reached. What we know for sure is that Marlowe
&gt; developed the English drama up to the Shakespeare standard and that a
&gt; number of early Shakespeare plays were at least started and drafted by
&gt; Marlowe. The claim of Marlovians, that the probability that his death
&gt; was a set-up must lead to the conclusion that he continued writing as
&gt; Shakespeare, is in no way self-evident, since, if he survived and
&gt; continued writing, there still could be a number of co-authors.

On the &quot;complete works of Shakespeare&quot; no other poet's name has ever

works. The consequence of this in reality is that stratfordians accept
no other author of Shakespeare than Shakspere, which is not only
stupidly narrow-minded but completely illogical as well.

Who all the co-authors were (besides Marlowe, Fletcher, Dekker,
Beaumont and other poets) concealed and not concealed is then another
problem, but stratfordians should at least and at last accept it as a
problem. It will not grow less for their suppressing it.

I have no problem whatever accepting the possibility of multiple authorship,
although in most cases I have a lot of difficulty discerning the evidence.
There was a little sub-industry of scholars, during the the first 2/3 of the
20th Century, who spent a lot of ink on this very subject; for the most part
modern scholars have rejected this, however. Today, in addition to the more
or less acknowledged collaborations with Fletcher, there is some support for
Middleton's participation in Macbeth.

Again, if you can produce a cogent argument for co-authorship, fire away;
but &quot;self-evident&quot; isn't good enough.

Re:

authorship, although in most cases I have a lot of difficulty
discerning the evidence.

Questions:

What evidence - as distinct from &quot;reasonable&quot; inferences - are held to
exist for multiple authorship in the case of Fletcher and Middleton?

If the case for multiple authorship in these two instances is
predicated on what some or all scholars view as &quot;reasonable&quot;
inferences, can such inferences ever be more solid than those which led
Donald Foster and some other scholars to conclude that William
Shakespeare had authored William Peeter's funderal elegy?

Pretty much any modern scholarly edition of the plays in question should be
able to answer your first question. As for the second, I don't know.

No, it's perfectly reasonable and simple. If you allow any co-author
into the Shakespeare authorship, the Shakspere authorship will
disintegrate, which is not acceptable. The established order must be
maintained, since so many careers are dependent on it. It's like making
a hole in a Dutch dam. It can't be done without the sea taking over.

I don't believe for a moment that Laetrile cures cancer, and in fact
I've seen research stats and I know it doesn't; however, you are not
correct. Many cheap remedies actually go untested because there's not
much money to be made from them. Here in Toronto doctors were having
terrible trouble getting funding to research the effects of
tetracycline on bone cancer. Tetracycline was simply too cheap and
available for the drug companies to be interested in it. In the same
way, if Laetrile DID cure cancer, it would be a disaster for those
companies. It's easily and cheaply &quot;manufactured&quot; by anyone. Their
expensive drugs would be down the drain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the &quot;complete works of Shakespeare&quot; no other poet's name has ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been published beside that of Shakespeare, excepting only the very last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works. The consequence of this in reality is that stratfordians accept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no other author of Shakespeare than Shakspere, which is not only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stupidly narrow-minded but completely illogical as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's perfectly reasonable and simple. If you allow any co-author
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the Shakespeare authorship, the Shakspere authorship will
&gt;&gt;&gt; disintegrate, which is not acceptable.

&gt;&gt; Another antistrat strawman. People are arguing about the extent of
&gt;&gt; co-authorship of particular plays all the time.

&gt;&gt; The established order must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; maintained, since so many careers are dependent on it.

&gt;&gt; Another common bond among antistrats, Holocaust deniers,

&gt; O God, here we go again.

&gt;&gt;and other
&gt;&gt; assorted cranks is the belief that &quot;orthodoxy&quot; is fighting to preserve
&gt;&gt; its place at the feeding trough.

&gt; In the case of Shakespeare, actors, docents, and other workers would
&gt; simply relocate from Stratford to Hackney, right?

"/>

If your 'smoking Oxgun' were found, why do you think the Stratford
Tourism people are going to fold up their stages and slink away in the
night? BTW, when Oxfordians define &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, so they JUST mean the
folks at Stratford? My understanding was that they included a mammoth
industry that has fingers in eVERy pie.

You are making several leaps here:

1) You are assuming it cures 100% of all cases;
2) You are assuming that governments will allow anyone to grind apricot

3) You are assuming cancer victims will trust a bottle of Laetrille
from Gino's Deli, Dry-cleaning, and Cancer Treatment to the same extent
they will trust one from, say, GlaxoSmithKline

Since you do mean what you wrote, that is putting Holocaust deniers on
the same level with &quot;antistrats and other assorted cranks&quot;, I must
point out to you, that there is a distinct difference between denying
historical events stretched over 12 years and doubting what was written
by actors. We &quot;antistrats&quot; do not deny the fact that &quot;Shakespeare's&quot;
name was written over the plays. This is a historical fact that can't
be denied. What we question is the identity of that &quot;Shake-Speare&quot;,
whom Will Shakspere himself never wrote in that manner. To compare
reasonable doubts in the meaning of what is written with denying the
Holocaust is therefore irrelevant for a Historian.

Shakespeare's authorship of the canon isn't a &quot;historical event&quot; - or a

Yes, but Oxfordians are not always reasonable either. That bunch that
now has launched 'Sir Henry Neville' as a new candidate are all old
Oxfordians, who simply continue to get derailed along the wrong path,
irretrievably lost forever like stupid policemen following a phoney
trail. I just posted this on 'Sir Henry Neville':
&quot;Where is Sir Henry Neville's theatrical schooling? Where are his
Cambridge connections? When did he find time to write all that stuff
for the theatre and why? He couldn't even have got paid for it. There
is nothing here - except his kinship with Bacon.&quot;
Pardon me, Laila, for scrapping Oxford, but his only foot into the
Shakespeare authorship is by his precarious son-in-law Derby. Take it
as a compliment.

What I can't understand is how you can link Bacon with Lancashire and
Chester. Bacon's contacts with Derby were exclusively legal, there are
no letters extant except business correspondance between them, while
the Lancashire links with Shakespeare are so obvious. Either a link is
missing here, or there never was any link of theatre cöoperation
between them, which seems to be what's indicated. Or do you have any
extra card up your sleeve?

I really must say, Laila, that if you find Bacon lacking, even more is
lacking in Derby. There is absolutely nothing to link him with
Shakespeare except speculation, and he wasn't even at Cambridge. We
don't know if he at all visited Navarre, and the so called 'northern
dialect elements' in Shakespeare have also proved uncertain, while all
the links are in Bacon's hands. He has the right connections
everywhere, with Sir Philip Sidney and his circle (the model for the
'Sonnets'), with Navarre and the court of Henri IV through his brother
Anthony, who was intimate with that king, with Cambridge, with the
theatre, in fact, the case for Bacon as Shakespeare is over-obvious,
since nothing speaks against it except common envy. Even the Marlowe
theory is much looser, since there are no links with Marlowe to Sidney,
none to Navarre and none to Shakspere, although stratfordians nowadays
are pretty sure Marlowe and Shakspere must have been intimate with each
other in order to write &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; at
the same time. Even the enigmatic sonnets speak for Bacon, since the
only parallel to their self-humiliation is found in Bacon's infamous
letters of obseqiousness to scoundrels in office like Buckingham and
king James. Bacon suffered all his life from his inferior position,
only temporarily he was raised according to his deserts, but only to be
cast down again, a case which is thoroughly reflected in the sonnets
again and again. You find that special idiosyncratic self-humiliating
obsequiousness nowhere else in the letters of that time except in
Bacon's Letters and 'Shakespeare's' sonnets.

Sorry, Laila, but Derby can never become more in the Shakespeare debate
than a secondary co-author along with Oxford.

yours faithfully,

John Bede
