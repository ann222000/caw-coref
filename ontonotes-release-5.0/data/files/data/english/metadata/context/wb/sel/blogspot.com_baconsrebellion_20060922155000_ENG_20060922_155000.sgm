The House of Delegates leadership has announced a legislative package
that would dedicate $50 million a year in state funds over 10 years in
order to qualify for matching federal funds to upgrade METRO service to
Northern Virginia.

According to a press release from the Speaker of the House, the
package would dedicate the first $20 million annually of the existing
tax on automobile insurance premiums to Metro, and increase the portion
of recordation tax receipts directed to localities by an additional $60
million, which would mean an additional $30 million for Northern
Virginia.

The funding, says the press release "will support the Metro’s 10-Year
Capital Improvement Program, developed to adequately recapitalize the
system and keep its assets in a state of good repair." Legislators
provided only the barest of details of what METRO improvements they have
in mind.

“These funds will help preserve and expand the commuting options for
the citizens of eastern Prince William,” said [Del. Jeffrey M.
Frederick, R-Woodbridge]. “Hopefully, as Metro does more to eliminate
waste and make their operations more efficient, this investment,
combined with the federal match, will help bring Metro into the 21st
Century and begin the process of expanding the system to Woodbridge and
points south.” The METRO website says that its $12.2 billion, 10-year
capital improvement plan would replace depreciated assets, increase the
length of trains from four/six cars to eight, and add 114 miles of rail
in multiple projects.

The proposed federal match is not set in stone, although Cong. Davis
ought to be able to deliver it. This is the time when you should chime
in that any such match should be tied to some performance measures,
which would be a good idea. Take the $50 million a year for this one
sacred transportation cow serving one corner of the commonwealth, do the
same for other modes in that and other regions, and I bet the math
produces a program of about .... $1 billion a year.

But the political threat to the House Republicans is in the I-95,
Beltway corridor. Targeting is a concept that comes to mind.

4:02 My recollection is that Davis' bill includes the establishment
of an inspector general's office. WMATA sorely needs this type of
oversight. Of course, the creation of an IG does not, in and of itself,
fix all of WMATA's inefficiencies, but it is a start.

What else would help is the MSM that would be willing to deviate from
its cherished belief that the only solutions to any problems are more
government spending and higher taxes.

Phil Rodokanakis, president of the Virginia chapter of the Club for
Growth (and a Bacon's Rebellion contributor) responded to the House
leadership as follows:

Thank you all for holding the line against taxes. However, this plan
deserves:

1) An “A+” for creative financing (without burdening the taxpayers)

2) An “F-” for accountability

It does nothing to root out Metro’s habitual and historic
inefficiencies or their gross mismanagement practices. It actually
rewards Metro’s management for their continued waste and abuse of
taxpayer-funded resources by giving them even more money to waste.

And please don’t tell me that the watered down provisions contained
in Rep. Tom Davis’ pork-laden bill that call for the establishment of an
IG will have any impact on controlling Metro’s mismanagement and
inefficiencies. The only way to “save” Metro is to privatize it. On the
contrary, your bill assures that Metro will continue being addicted to
government subsidies. You’re simply throwing good money after bad!

Oh well, who cares about accounting for taxpayer dollars? It’s there
to be spent after all--just like you all didn’t bat an eye when you
voted for the state budget this year, which calls for the largest
expansion of government in our life time!

Why would a privatized Metro, a giant entity that would enjoy a
virtual monopoly, be more efficient? Ask the folks in Maryland how the
unregulated monopoly electric power industry is working out (coming to
our state in 2011). Perhaps if Metro were broken into component parts,
or someincentives were worked in.

re: "Why would a privatized Metro, a giant entity that would enjoy a

ditto for a privatized VDOT?

fair question methinks.

Are there viable examples/business models of privatized Metro-type
transit?

What would happen if .. a private entity were offered incentives for
every dollar saved?

I know.. the next issue would be would they cut services - and the
answer to that is to establish performance standards that would directly
affect the agreement - even add penalties.

This is done with schools and prisons as well as many other
traditional government services - .. check out the reservation systems
for state parks these days...

I think the point is that we all know that without changes METRO will
operate not too differently than VDOT. At the very least - performance
standards need to be part of the equation - as well as replacement of
the management if performance levels are not maintained.

Too bad Mr. Howell and the folks on his team.. did not see fit to
take the opportunity to establish accountability that went along with
the funding.. I agree.

HB5070 might address some of the accountability concerns.

"might" is the operative word .. this looks like (I hope) a
placeholder....

HB 5070 Transportation Accountability, Joint Commission on; created.

the entire text:

"Joint Commission on Transportation Accountability. Creates the Joint
Commission on Transportation Accountability to carry out close
legislative oversight of state agencies with transportation
responsibilities."

JLARC has produce a report on transportation than includes Transit.
I'd not be suprised that at the least Bill Howell and other legislators
are well aware of it and it's recommendations.

It can be found at (page 100 and on):

http://jlarc.state.va.us/Meetings/November01/fundingppt.pdf

In general.. the legislators (probably via their Staff) DO seem to be
basing their legislation.. at least in part on the issues identified by
JLARC .. and the Virgnia Auditor of Public Accounts.

I'm encouraged... but my expectations are remaining low... for good
reasons.

Here's another JLARC recommendation:

* Establish an intermodal office with professional staff needs to be
established to advise the Secretary of Transportation and CTB regarding
intermodal issues

The Staff should provide:

* Intermodal analysis regarding major transportation corridors

* Coordination between agencies regarding multimodal projects

ye gods... I'm sure that is blasphemy to VDOT... probably the reason
there no legislation.. :-) < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
