I usually play Final Fantasy XI Online for Windows.  I'm going to take the
Puppetmaster job to level 75.  Its a very powerful job and I just acquired
the Stormwalker body for my puppet.  The next one I can get is the
Valoredge melee puppet equiped with its own sword and shield.  The
Harliquinn frame I have now fights hand-to-hand and can cast many
different spells and it will cast Cure and Cure II on me when I need it.
One character in FFXI can play any of the 18 different jobs available in
the game and can freely switch between them with the help of a Moogle in a
Mog House.  There are 6 starter jobs and the rest are advanced jobs which
must be unlocked via a quest.  At level 18 characters can do the quest
which unlucks the ability to gain a subjob or secondary job.

I have to level the Warrior job now so I can use it was a subjob for
Puppetmaster after level 25.  I had been using Monk which gives my
Puppetmaster the Martial Arts Job Trait early on and gives me an HP
boost.  At level 25 Puppetmaster gets Martial Arts which negates the
Monk's Martial Arts II.  Warrior will give me a Defense boost so I can
tank better in a party.  I've been soloing the Puppetmaster all the way to
level 24 but the points needed to advance to the next level after 25 get
much bigger and I'll have no choice but to party level to advance faster.
With Warrior as the subjob not only do I get a defense bonus which I
really need but I can also use the Job Ability Provoke which makes a mob
attack me instead of my party's White Mage who is casting Cure II or Cure
III to heal us.  I also want to get high enough in levels to complete the
Rank 4 and 5 missions for the nation of Bastok so I can get the Airship
pass which will make traveling around between the different major cities
in the game a lot easier.  Right now I have to plunk down huge amounts of
gil to rent a Chocobo.

I've been writing anime fan fiction since 2000.  Recently I posted chapter
2 to a new fic called "Mahou Shoujo Ranma" and its been getting rave
reviews.  I've had very few negative ones except for a Tenchi Muyo, Ranma
1/2, Starcraft crossover called "The Great War" which many readers were
against my Tenchi+Washu pairing.  This was when TM was still on Cartoon
Network.  Ever since then more people have become more open to different
pairings.

A lot of fan fics are at FanFiction.net.  The link to my author's page is
on my website, the link is in my sig.  Take a look and let me know what
you think.  "The Dark Lord of Jurai" is my first fan fic ever and I'm
working on a sequel.

Rock on - ancient queen
Follow those who pale
In your shadow

Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now - do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home

How is the MMO side of Phantasy Star Universe?  Reviews of the
single-player mode I've seen were rather bad but some say the MMO feature
is the game's saving grace.
