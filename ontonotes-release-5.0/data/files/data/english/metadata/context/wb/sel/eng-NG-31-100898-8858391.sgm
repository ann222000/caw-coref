I breathwalked with Jesus (well, his words) yesterday!
The cadence is 4X4, 4 steps for the in-breath and 4
steps for the out-breath. Vocalization on the out-breath
is optional

IN 2 3 4; Walk with Je-sus
IN 2 3 4; Show com-pass-ion
IN 2 3 4; Feed the hun-gry
IN 2 3 4; Help heal the sick
IN 2 3 4; House the home-less
IN 2 3 4; Clothe the na-ked
IN 2 3 4; Love your neigh-bor
IN 2 3 4; Walk with Je-sus

Have I missed any good ones? Jesus (a guy whose
mum was a virgin LOL and whose daddy was ROFLMAO
God) said some good stuff, sort of like the Rotary Club.

Oh, so that's it! And I always thought that Joseph was a cuckold.
Auden has a poem about it.

Joseph, have you heard
What Mary says occurred;
Yes, it may be so.
Is it likely? No.

Mary may be pure,
But Joseph, are you sure?
How is one to tell?
Suppose, for instance.Well..

Maybe, maybe not.
But, Joseph, you know what
Your world, of course, will say
About you anyway.

The virgin birth is symbolic. But has been expressed
as concrete, as so much of mythical representations are.
(The Buddha was said to be born from his mother's side.)
Primitive myths have the advantage of absurdity so that
no thinking person can believe them explicitly.  But those
of early civilization tried to blend the world and the spirit
at the expense of the spirit in favor of the worldly, namely
those who suppose they can think the 'truth'.

These unnatural births indicate something out of the ordinary.
Jesus said we must be 'born again', another symbolism of
extraordinary regeneration, new unnatural births.  The Buddha
said there is liberation in this very life.  Unnatural births of the
teachers indicate the possibility for ourselves.  Unless we take
the world at face value as most do, and take literature literally.

BTW, who was your daddy, and his daddy, and his daddy?
Was the first his own father?

For just a tick there, I thought Yeats said, &quot;furry&quot;.
But that must have been one of those hot flashes from

Yeats has written some exquisite poems.
This isn't one of them.
He was descending in senility when he
penned this, especially the last line,
which is surpassing vulgar. BTW, he
prefigures Global Warming in the 3rd
line.

Ah, well, what can you expect from a smiling sixty-year old pubic man?
...Surpassing vulgar miniparodies aside, I think maybe that would be
a good one to copy here, even if it's not uniformly exquisite (to my
ear) and not necessarily uniformly congenial to these particular
newsgroups in its own homebrewed hyperdualistic mysticism.

Among School Children

I

I walk through the long schoolroom questioning;
A kind old nun in a white hood replies;
The children learn to cipher and to sing,
To study reading - books and histories,
To cut and sew, be neat in everything
In the best modern way - the children's eyes
In momentary wonder stare upon
A sixty-year-old smiling public man.

II

I dream of a Ledaean body, bent
Above a sinking fire,  a tale that she
Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
That changed some childish day to tragedy -
Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
Or else, to alter Plato's parable,
Into the yolk and white of the one shell.

III

And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
I look upon one child or t'other there
And wonder if she stood so at that age -
For even daughters of the swan can share
Something of every paddler's heritage -
And had that colour upon cheek or hair,
And thereupon my heart is driven wild:
She stands before me as a living child.

IV

Her present image floats into the mind -
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
And took a mess of shadows for its meat?
And I though never of Ledaean kind
Had pretty plumage once - enough of that,
Better to smile on all that smile, and show
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.

V

What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
Honey of generation had betrayed,
And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
As recollection or the drug decide,
Would think her Son, did she but see that shape
With sixty or more winters on its head,
A compensation for the pang of his birth,
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?

VI

Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
Solider Aristotle played the taws
Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.

VII

Both nuns and mothers worship images,
But those the candles light are not as those
That animate a mother's reveries,
But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
And yet they too break hearts - O presences
That passion, piety or affection knows,
And that all heavenly glory symbolise -
O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;

VIII

Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul.
Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer,
Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?

-- W. B. Yeats

&gt;&gt; Primitive myths have the advantage of absurdity so that
&gt;&gt; no thinking person can believe them explicitly.  But those
&gt;&gt; of early civilization tried to blend the world and the spirit
&gt;&gt; at the expense of the spirit in favor of the worldly, namely
&gt;&gt; those who suppose they can think the 'truth'.

&gt;&gt; These unnatural births indicate something out of the ordinary.
&gt;&gt; Jesus said we must be 'born again', another symbolism of
&gt;&gt; extraordinary regeneration, new unnatural births.  The Buddha
&gt;&gt; said there is liberation in this very life.  Unnatural births of the
&gt;&gt; teachers indicate the possibility for ourselves.  Unless we take
&gt;&gt; the world at face value as most do, and take literature literally.

&gt;&gt; BTW, who was your daddy, and his daddy, and his daddy?
&gt;&gt; Was the first his own father?

The chicken. Logically, the egg can't survive without the adult to feed and
nurture it. Think of a human baby too, it can't survive without the care and
feeding of adults.

Well, as I suggested, to me &quot;supreme being&quot; is a supremely meaningless
phrase (partly because I have no idea what a &quot;being&quot; is supposed to be,
but mostly because I can't assign any non-fatuous meaning to the notion
of any hierarchy among such &quot;being&quot;s which is such that there need or

For religious people they assign the quality that is supreme only in God as
&quot;supremely powerful&quot;. But powerful in what sense? For me it's power only in
the sense of being able to lead people to freedom from suffering and death.
And such power is dependent on having both supreme knowledge and the supreme
wisdom of how to apply that knowledge to produce the causes which lead to
the desired effect -- the creation of Christ).

Conjectures on the living and the dead.

It seems to me that 'being' is the difference between life and death.
Being is awareness or consciousness, a 'knowledge' not through learning
or analysis but direct momentary perception.  Such knowledge is inexpressable,
but that's only a problem if there were some need to define or communicate
it.  Plants and animals other than human use their knowledge without
any need for verbal expression.

All the human senses have been 'explained' mechanically. We are
electro-chemical machines, organic robots as it were. A machine
doesn't need to know anything in order to function.  But we do
have 'being', a direct knowledge of experience, something that
no machine needs or has any use for.  It is unexplained and
unaccountable.  But that useless thing is really all that
matters to us.

A universe without any 'being', namely awareness-knowledge
of it's own experience, must seem to us virtually non-existent.
There could be infinite numbers of operating mechanical universes,
but without their knowledge of themselves, or knowledge of them
by outsiders, they are the same as nothing, as far as humans may
judge.  For us momentary being-awareness is everything, and
without it there is even less than nothing.

The notion of an all powerful supreme being seems out of place
in these times of rapid mechanical advances.  Any supposed God
seems not to do anything, least of all answer prayers or provide
miracles.  We suppose that we do everything by ourselves through
toil and perils.  But considering our entire belief and dependence
on cause and effect, (which may be a Grave Error) we must realize
that all actions whatever are preceeded by causes, none of them
sufficient, but in the aggregate adequate.

Man does not and cannot originate a single thing, not a thought,
not even a cough or a blink.  All the self-important conceits of
man are refuted by the long long chain of cause and effect.
Rather than initiators of action, men are acted upon.

The ancient excuse for 'being', (the knowledge of experience),
and the causal factors of experience that we know of was imputed
to God, since no other suspect could be apprehended.

That's what we get when we try to make sense of the world.
Either a careless God, or the predestined tortures of Fate.
But since there is love, mercy, and goodness in the world,
as well as all the bad things, God can't be a complete bastard.
There is hope for those who need it.

Monotheists had to grant both the good and the bad to God,
but were careful to say that these human judgements were
presumtuous, since judgement belongs not to man
but to God alone.

But is it really any of our business?  Any sense we make is
likely to be greatly mistaken.  Even in the best cases, the
result of too much dualistic reasoning is demoralizing and
unpleasant.  In the end, does any opinion make any difference?

But if we have the opinion that we ought to have no opinions,
then the clouds all pass away.  We sort of made them up
ourselves.

Explained or not, here we are all the time.  Why not enjoy it?
Why worry over tomorrow?  Is today all used up already?

&gt;&gt; of any hierarchy among such &quot;being&quot;s which is such that there need or
&gt;&gt; could be any &quot;supreme&quot; member of that hierarchy);

&gt;For religious people they assign the quality that is supreme only in God as
&gt;&quot;supremely powerful&quot;. But powerful in what sense? For me it's power only in
&gt;the sense of being able to lead people to freedom from suffering and death.
&gt;And such power is dependent on having both supreme knowledge and the supreme
&gt;wisdom of how to apply that knowledge to produce the causes which lead to
&gt;the desired effect -- the creation of Christ).

&gt;&gt; however, assuming as
&gt;&gt; before that &quot;supreme being&quot; makes sense

&gt;Yes, one has to choose a quality which that being possesses in perfection,
&gt;or at least unsurpassed.

&gt;, why couldn't a clockwork automaton

Any first cause must be uncaused itself.
In fact, causation only applies in our scheme of time.
So the first cause couldn't really be a 'cause' as we know it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why only one? What precludes many causes

How independent are the 'many causes' in the present?

In the classical scheme there is a beginning of time, a single event.
How would multiple entities arrange to meet on the corner of
nowhere at precisely no-time?

I never said I believe in cause and effect.
It really just looks like a feature of 'time as a concept'.
Time is thinkable, but completely unobservable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you believe in cause and effect, then there is no other

They are very much independent, as independent as there are living beings.
Each living being can produce independent causes not tied to each other.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lee Rudolph

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I find it hard to visualize what a non-living supreme being would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like. Can you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, as I suggested, to me &quot;supreme being&quot; is a supremely meaningless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phrase (partly because I have no idea what a &quot;being&quot; is supposed to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but mostly because I can't assign any non-fatuous meaning to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; notion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of any hierarchy among such &quot;being&quot;s which is such that there need or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could be any &quot;supreme&quot; member of that hierarchy);

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For religious people they assign the quality that is supreme only in God
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;supremely powerful&quot;. But powerful in what sense? For me it's power only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the sense of being able to lead people to freedom from suffering and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And such power is dependent on having both supreme knowledge and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supreme
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wisdom of how to apply that knowledge to produce the causes which lead
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the desired effect -- the creation of Christ).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, assuming as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before that &quot;supreme being&quot; makes sense

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, one has to choose a quality which that being possesses in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perfection,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or at least unsurpassed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, why couldn't a clockwork automaton

Cause and effect are how things appear to us when we
attempt to account for events.  But it's really just the
common prejudice.  If you think in terms of time, then
cause and effect are how time works.  But where is this
time?  It's there in the past and there in the future, but
never here.  Have you ever been in the past or the future?

All anyone has ever known or ever will is this Now.
Technically, this Now is totally without dimension,
therefore it isn't a 'time'.  Time is only a measure of
the fabulous past and future.  We can't measure what's
here, but we pretend to measure what doesn't even
exist except in our imagination.

Is there any time at all except (the gift of) the present?
It doesn't arise from 'thuh past' and it doesn't fade into
'thuh future'.  'Now' is it's own excuse, it's own reason,
it's own splendor.  It doesn't come or go.  It doesn't
move for anything.

What possible cause can there be for this?

We invented the concept of time to account for changes in the dimension of
space, in particluar the rotation of the earth. Time is only a concept and
has as its cause human thought and the need for humans to measure the cycles
of dusk to dawn. It's also real handy for keeping appointments. The cause of
the time concept is human necessity.

As far as what the concept of time stands for, time has no cause it just
always was, just like space or the universe. There could not be any any
time, no space. Space cannot arise from no-space. Something cannot begotten
from nothing.

According to the enlightened guy, human beings came about as a result of
intelligent-awareness made of mind who found the earth a curious delight,
and as they tasted more and more of the earth (whatever that means) their
bodies became solid (not spontaneous) but an evolution.

It's hard to imagine what the transitional state from spirit to matter might
be like, however again according to the enlightened guy he could pass
unhindered through a wall. Such a feat would logically involve some sort of
transitional state from matter to non-matter and then to matter again. Jesus
also is said to have vanished or escaped in similar fashion when crowds
tried to stone him.

My only problem with this evolution from a non-material form to a material
form is what was used as the blueprint for the human body? Why restrict the
human body to having no wings to fly, etc.  It would seem more logical that
there was no control over the evolutionary process from a non-material to a
material form. And then there's the problem of how did some of these beings
evolve into male and others into female? To me, it's not really important
how physical life began, it's more important to me to answer the question
what's the ultimate form of existence I could become, or what's my ultimate
potential? And I've found my answer and tasted it's fruit.

&gt;&gt; It also seems that the more intelligent the species, the less likely it
&gt;&gt; can survive on its own from birth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Who was that masked man?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not yet. BoingBoing had a sequential reading list a week
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or so ago that I didn't copy :( . I just have kinda a random
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; collection, but ToT is my all-time fav so far, sent by a

&gt;&gt;&gt; This list is in the right order (or seems to be)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I buy most of my books second hand, they are cheap enough to take
&gt;&gt;&gt; chances on things you wouldn't normally read.

&gt;&gt; Thx! Owe you a pint, next I'm in London.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Spontaneous generation of life is more probable than spontaneous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;generation of a supreme being.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is tautologous only if &quot;a supreme being&quot; is an instance of &quot;life&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (It might be true--assuming for argument's sake that it's meaningful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; despite the inclusion in it of the not obviously meaningful phrase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;supreme being&quot;--without being tautologous, of course.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lee Rudolph

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I find it hard to visualize what a non-living supreme being would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like. Can you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, as I suggested, to me &quot;supreme being&quot; is a supremely meaningless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phrase (partly because I have no idea what a &quot;being&quot; is supposed to be,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but mostly because I can't assign any non-fatuous meaning to the notion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of any hierarchy among such &quot;being&quot;s which is such that there need or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could be any &quot;supreme&quot; member of that hierarchy);

&gt;&gt;&gt;For religious people they assign the quality that is supreme only in God as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;supremely powerful&quot;. But powerful in what sense? For me it's power only in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the sense of being able to lead people to freedom from suffering and death.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And such power is dependent on having both supreme knowledge and the supreme
&gt;&gt;&gt;wisdom of how to apply that knowledge to produce the causes which lead to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the desired effect -- the creation of Christ).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, assuming as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before that &quot;supreme being&quot; makes sense

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, one has to choose a quality which that being possesses in perfection,
&gt;&gt;&gt;or at least unsurpassed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;, why couldn't a clockwork automaton
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do the job?  (If the answer is &quot;it's not *alive*&quot;, then we have fallen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back into the molasses-pit of tautology.  Not that that isn't a tasty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place to hang out!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lee Rudolph

&gt;&gt;If you believe in cause and effect, then there is no other
&gt;&gt;thing in the cosmos but the first cause of all subsequent
&gt;&gt;causes.  Everything else is an effect without self-substance.

&gt;don't place that bet just yet
&gt;physicists these days suspect it really is
&gt;turtles all the way down
">

Neither a causeless beginning of space-time nor
a beginningless (and also necessarily causeless)
eternity of all existence is conceivable.  We can't
grasp either proposition.  Yet here is the cosmos
all the same.  It's beyond understanding.

Before string theory it was assumed that space-time
was born from no-space-no-time, namely 'nothing'.
The big bang happened nowhere at no time.  Without
space, where could it happen?  Without time, when
could it happen?  That theory is the inconceivable result
of scientific observations and mathematics.  But who
can fathom it?  Even the math (our finest, most exact
and reasonable tool) falls apart on the way to point zero.

Space-time isn't what it appears.  Since we see space
and can't see time, we suppose that all events occur in
self-evident space.  We say objects move from here to
there in space.  But that isn't so.  Nothing can move in
space.  A snapshot of space captures it's motionlessness.
All motions must take place in invisible time.  Time is
defined as the 'motion' of planets and clocks anyway.

Strangely, clocks can tell time, but we can't do it.
That's why everyone has a watch and there are clocks
everywhere we look.  Physical time may exist, but our
connection to it is plainly unnatural and artificial.

What time is it?  Nobody knows, so we ask the clocks.
We pretend to know the difference between a long
time and a short one, but we really don't have a clue.
It seems to us that good times are quite short and
bad times much too long - in spite of a clock telling
us that they are equal in minutes. (Whatever 'minutes'
may be.  Clocks know, but we don't.)

Now the string theorists are attempting to apply temporal
continuity to dimensions other than time.  This doesn't
look kosher.  The fundamental forces they attempt to unify
all appear to be time-bound. (Either forwards or backwards.)
Time seems to be the most fundamental of dimensions.
(That we can see.  But it may be that the space and time
boundaries of physical events are just a one-sided view.
It could be that the boundaries are really the other way
around.  Still we must be anthropocentric or what are we?
Mathematicians?)

So how can time (or causality) leap an atemporal gap?
A femtosecond of disconnection is as good as an infinity
of eternities.  How can anything get from there to here
in the proposed creation of any 'new' universe?

Or of this one, for that matter.  I think string theorists are
trying to preserve the newtonian continuity of time by looking
for a reasonable 'cause' for this universe even across the
timeless gap before the banging forth of space-time.

M theorists suppose that there are branes, spaces, and
times apart from our cosmos that gave rise to this one.
Where is any evidence of that?

Even if they were right that physicality is eternal rather
than having a known beginning, where are we then?
Causeless eternal being is just as much an enigma as
causeless cosmic creation from nothing.  Neither case
depends on or even allows causation.  Yet we are all
concerned with causation as if it were the ultimate
of necessary reasonableness that it plainly is not.

But if the stringers are right, then we'll all have
flying cars and monkey butlers who bring us pie.
Or not.

These types of discussions always take place from the pre-existing
