What consequences, great, small, short-term, near-term, geopolitical,
domestic, would this have?

Quoted from Kai Bird,
"Republican minority leader, Senator William White, boldly declared on
July3 , 1945, that the Pacific war might end "quickly" if only Truman
would clarify surrender terms (to indicate the Japanese monarchy would
be preserved). This view was echoed by former President Herbert
Hoover, who wrote Truman in May and early June that he, too, favored a
clarification. This very newspaper (the Washington Post) published a
series of editorials in the spring of 1945 urging such a course on
Truman. Obviously, if Truman decided to do so, he could have issued a
clarification with the political support of his Republican opposition."

IMHO would probably not have made any difference. Through August 1945
the Japanese still held most of their conquests in China, held Korea,
and were at peace with the Soviet Union (and not expecting Stalin to
turn on them). While preservation of the Imperial system and the
person of the Emperor were part of any feelers the Japanese put out
they also expected to be able to maintain some of their gains (ie:
Manchukuo), maintain the empire (ex: keep Korea), have no foreign
occupation of Japan &amp; more. They still felt that the cost in blood of
an allied invasion of Japan would cause the allies to settle for much
less than "unconditional surrender". The fact that the conditions
listed for a termination of the war were "rationally" considered by
them even to be negotiable (which means they would expect to come out
with a few of them as they wanted) shows how detached from reality
they still were.

Unfortunately it was necessary for the Japanese to be totally clubbed
senseless to have them surrender, and even then there were radical
elements in the military that attempted to prevent the broadcast by
the Emperor and the surrender.

Bottom line, it still would have taken the 2 bombs to convince the
Japanese to surrender. One could make the argument that with a "keep
the Emperor" pledge by the US only one bomb would have been needed,
but the close timing of the drops and many other factors would have,
in my opinion, prevented surrender after Hiroshima alone.

It wouldn't have been enough at that stage; the Japanese still wanted to hang onto Korea, the
Kuriles, Karafuto (Southern Sakhalin), and Manchuko at the very least, no Allied Occupation,
Japanese supvervision of demobilization, and Japan trying War Criminals. Those were
definite non-starters as far as Truman was concerned. "You can keep the Emperor, but
everything else we reject" would have been the line drawn. With that, there's no avoiding
15 Kt on Hiroshima, and 20 Kt on Nagasaki, not to mention the Soviet Invasion of Manchuria
that the Japanese feared, but in their "cloud-cookoo land" felt was a year away. Three
Soviet Army Groups on 9 Aug swept such delusions aside, along with the Kwantung Army.
