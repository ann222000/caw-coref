My group must to slay an evil cleric in order to free a trapped soul. Not a
specific one. Just an evil cleric. Now they found a temple devoted to an
archdevil. They have no evidence that the cultists did something "wrong".

My question is: if they enter the temple and begin killing the cultists with
no reason, is this considered an evil act (among my party there is a paladin
and a good cleric and a good druid)?

I mean, the world is full of good and evil person, but for ex. no paladin
walk through the streets with his detect evil active and kills every evil
person (or a black guard doing the same with good people).
Or for ex. in big cities there are temples devoted to the good gods and to
the bad ones, but there is no neverending-war between them. They just
cohabit...

I wait for opinions...  :)

They ought to give them a chance to repent.  Keith Baker hit it just
about right with his article here:

http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20041115a

"Why do you hurt your fellow citizens?"

The innkeeper froze. "What?"

"I can see the greed swirling in your soul," Handor said. "Do you
water down your ale? Charge three crowns when the price is two? Or
worse?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," the man stammered. His eyes
flickered down to Handor's blade.

"I am a paladin of the Silver Flame. I am sworn to fight evil in all
its forms. My sword is for the fiends and monsters that deserve
neither reason nor mercy. But you are no monster, and you can still
find redemption." Handor put his hand on the hosteller's shoulder.
"Consider your actions. Think about those you have harmed. Seek out a
minister and cleanse your soul. The true darkness is rising, and if we
are to survive we must all find a path to the light. If you
cannot . . . then perhaps you are a monster, after all."

This setup screams "Screw the Paladin!" to me. :)

It's weaker than the following example:
To save the world from Evil, you must kill all
firstborn childs below age three in the town of Xapladas.

Do the characters know, that the temple is devoted to an archdevil? An
archdevil is evil incarnate. People who worship a devil can't be good.
People who even support a devil can't be good. Ending the cult is a
good thing! The big question is: How do they do it?

My question is: How do the characters act? If they have no knowledge
of the devil and start killing cultists without a simple conversation
(like: "We know you worship evil! Repent! Step aside, we'll burn down
this sacrilege."), they are probably neutral or even evil. They should
at the very least have the intention to do good by killing the cultist
and they should show the intention via roleplaying. If they start to
enjoy killing without making sure that they kill the "right guy", well
that's evil.

An example: Winter. Near a small human village the group encounters a
bunch of 13 goblins. First round in combat drops the leader of the
goblins, they start to flee. Would it be good to let them escape? The
human paladin of the group hunts down the majority of the goblins
until they don't pose a threat to the village. Did he commit an act of
evil? or good? He wanted to protect the village, so he did the right
thing. If he hadn't mentioned his intention, well than it would
probably be an act of evil.

That's my first instinct too, but just to stir up trouble...

It's Evil to kill a random Evil devil worshipper to free a trapped soul,
but is it Evil to kill a devil worshipper because he is a devil
worshipper? Because I can easily imagine a setup where the party of LG
inquisitors goes around rooting out Evil devil worshippers with no
ulterior motive, and I'd expect less people would claim that is Evil
than this soul freeing business. Is this more Evil because there's an
ulterior motive? Or less because you're actually helping an innocent
third party?

What if you keep an eye on the devil worshippers until they try to do
something nasty like sacrificing virgins or poisoning water supplies and
then kill them while they're "resisting arrest"? Without the wider
context with the trapped soul, I don't think anyone would claim that is
Evil, since this is the absolute staple of D&amp;D: bad guys do bad things,
good guys kill them and take their stuff. But deliberatly waiting for
someone to give you a justification to kill them... is that really
better than just killing them outright?

Yep, sounds like "screw the paladin" to me too. :)

I guess what's causing the cognitive dissonance it that this is just not
the way the metaphysics usually works in D&amp;D: sacrifice of semi-random
intelligent creatures typically generates energy to accomplish Evil
goals, not Good goals. (I'm assuming that that the soul is an innocent
unfairly trapped, not some sort of fiendish entity.)

Hm, in some worlds the problem isn't so much killing the cleric, but
in convincing others that he was actually evil.
Likely killing a secretive cultist on the street will get you in
trouble even without a Paladin, but clearing out a hidden temple full
of human sacrificing cultists will likely earn you a "hero" label,
even if your motives were selfish.

You're basically killing people in an unprovoked attack; in other
words, murder. Even in D&amp;D land this is evil, and chaotic to boot.
Your DM is trying to bait you.

You could stake out the archdevil temple and wait for them to do
something evil. If they're smart cultists, they'll keep the
kidnappings and virgin sacrifices on the QT and very hush-hush, so
this might take some effort. My advice: don't take the easy way out.
Make damn sure the priests in this temple are actually committing some
atrocity before gutting them.

No reason? Surely the party has some reason to kill the cultists and
this reason is all-important, because it's the intent, not the act,
that determines if the party is doing Evil.

BTW, I think that it's possible that if the party stakes out the
temple, the GM will have a few innocents killed as sacrifices and have
the party (or possibly just the paladin) punished in some matter for
letting that happen.

I'm reminded of a time when I played a paladin for a new campaign in a
country where slavery was legal.  Two clergy were "mistakenly" taken
as slaves, and I was sent to find them and release them - my mcguffin
for the campaign.

As a reason for the party to get together, we all had reasons to seek
a sage who could help us on our quests.  While I had an independent
lead to my quest of questioning the slave auctioneer, I had to wait
until the next slave auction.  This sage knew where the clergy were
now.  He was willing to sell me the information for 5,000gp.  I was a
1st level paladin who had to borrow 100gp from the church to book a
boat passage to meet this sage.  Not bloody likely.  He gave a similar
outrageous cost to all the PCs.

Later, he gathered us all together and offered an alternative.  He
once had a "Book of Evil" which was taken from him by some evil
wizard.  The wizard was out of town.  If the party were to get the
book from his house and bring it back to him, he would tell us what we
wanted to know.  When I asked the sage what the wizard wanted th ebook
for, all he said was "to do evil".  I kept quiet as the party
discussed what to do.  We had to figure out how to sneak around the
city, break into the house to burglarize it, try to stay away from the
town watch, bring the book back to the sage, then get out of Dodge to
avoid arrest.

I'm sitting there thinking.  This sage has the information I need to
help free two of my church's clergy.  For that information, he either
wants me to pay him 5,000gp or commit several acts of breaking the
law.  The country may be allowing slavery, but a law against burglary
is reasonable.  I at least had some potential lead.  I said "Your
price is too high" and left the sage's house.  I had no original
intention of ratting out the party anyway, but one did ask for my word
I wouldn't and I gave it.

The rest of the party carried out their burglary and got the book.  I
just sat there listening them do it.  They did have to fight some
skeletons, so the wizard who took the book was evil, but I didn't
regret my decision.  The sage rewarded them with a ledger that had the
information everyone needed for their own quests, most likely
everything was related somehow.  For metagame sake of the game the
party invited me back in to use the ledger and work together as a
party.

Yes it is.

But it is not Evil to kill him because being an Evil Devil Worshiper
he is a direct threat to the innocent and very unlikely to repent.

You are allowed to kill those who threaten the innocent if the threat
is serious and you lack an efficient or expedient alternative. You
aren't allowed to kill people to grap their stuff, or to benefit
yourself, or to benefit other third parties.

Motive MATTERS when discussing alignment.

I can't kill ANYONE, not even Evil Devil Worshipers because of stuff
that in no way involves them without being Evil. I'm helping an
innocent third party, but I'm doing so by deliberately going out and
finding someone to kill.

If ALL that is needed is the death of an Evil Cleric at the party's
hands I'd tend to ignore it, how long does the average party go
WITHOUT killing an Evil Cleric after all.... Sooner I get back to
normal adventuring the sooner that will happen on its own. If there is
additional ritual requirements I have REAL problems with "but
honestly, this is a GOOD human sacrifice."

Interesting.

I did not get full XP as everyone else in the party because I didn't
go on the main adventure - burglarizing the house.  When I mentioned
it here years ago consensus was I got a bum rap and should have been
given full XP anyway for the correct roleplay.  Didn't matter,
really.  I wasn't "fitting in" with that gaming group anyway.  It did
take a bit for me to get the hint, but I finally left.  Upsetting at
the time, but I've long since got over it.

I made an amusing anecdote over it that "Hadsil" is a jinx name for
me.  I first used it in an Ars Magica campaign.  That's what I named
my character's new born son.  The letters in the name are the first
letters of everyone's characters.  Unfortunately, that group soon
ended due to DM's new girlfriend not liking one of the players.  My
second Hadsil is the aforementioned Paladin, then that group and I
mutually parted.  My third Hadsil was an NPC flind cleric during an
attempt of me being a DM.  My association with that group did not end
well.

I dare not use "Hadsil" as a character name again. :)

Last time I checked, devils weren't renowned for their paladinic

Have these cultists always lived in a vacuum? Why would they go

temple, its priests, and the "evil cleric". Without that, they might
as well all be faceless Caryatid Columns.

So, first a little poor background:

A paladin was killed by a lich who rose him back as his "slaying servant"
and doing so the lich imprisoned the paladin's soul into the paladin's sword
(more like a phylactery) with a ritual which involved a sacrifice of a
cleric of the paladin's faith (so a good cleric :) ). The "ritual" of
freeing the so trapped soul will than involve a sacrifice of an evil cleric
(at least as the same level of the good one).

The group found the lich and killed him (but they haven't distroyed the
phyl. yet &gt;)  ) and found out how to free the soul.
So now they have to find this evil cleric. By gathering informations they
knew from an ancient person that when he was young, there were some rumors
that between the mountains were this temple devoted to an archdevil. But
since than, noone else had heard about that...
So the group decided to go to these mointains and arrived in a small village
of shepherds and peasants. They gathered informations and discovered that
occasionally a shepherd disappeard without leaving a trace, but no one
mentioned or suspects the cultists (they even don't know about their
existance...).

My idea is to "test" the sense of "good" of my party.

I thought that if they find the temple and simply begin to slay the cultists
without any evidence of a crime, this will be considered an evil act because
even if they are evil, no one should kill the first evil he encountes only
because he's evil. Moreover the paladin should be lawful to the laws, and
the law sais that to accuse someone you must first have proofs of the
crime...  (or am I wrong??).

Anyway, (spoiler ;) ) if they act in the "right" way and leave "in peace", I
will make the cultists attack them later because they discovered the temple
and no one out of the cult should know about its position...  :)

To all that said that it wouldn't be ab evil act because at least they
worship an archdevil and must be slain anyway (or similar opinions), I would
disagree. Otherwise (for ex.) Piergeiron of Waterdeep should collect his
army, go throught the streets with a detect evil alway active and free the
city from all the thief guilds and the evil deity worshipers/temples...

&gt; My group must to slay an evil cleric in order to free a trapped soul. Not
&gt; a specific one. Just an evil cleric. Now they found a temple devoted to an
&gt; archdevil. They have no evidence that the cultists did something &quot;wrong&quot;.

&gt; My question is: if they enter the temple and begin killing the cultists
&gt; with no reason, is this considered an evil act (among my party there is a
&gt; paladin and a good cleric and a good druid)?

&gt; I mean, the world is full of good and evil person, but for ex. no paladin
&gt; walk through the streets with his detect evil active and kills every evil
&gt; person (or a black guard doing the same with good people).
&gt; Or for ex. in big cities there are temples devoted to the good gods and to
&gt; the bad ones, but there is no neverending-war between them. They just
&gt; cohabit...

&gt; I wait for opinions...  :)

You don't compare a religious movement to a thief's guild, do you? You
said, that the cultists worship the devil. Do the cultists enlarge
their group? Do they try to gain new followers? Do they endanger the
souls of the innocent? Do they spread evil? DO YOU THINK THAT A
PALADIN CAN IGNORE THE CULT?
Would a paladin like Piergeiron of Waterdeep sit by and do nothing
about a cult of devil worshippers?
[DEVIL; Alignment: ALWAYS lawful evil; HELL, the place where the bad
boys go to]

My (tainted?) opinion is, that devil worshippers are a threat to
society. Their existence is evil and, depending on the religious
context, a sacrilege. Devil worshippers are not supposed to gather to
share a cup of tea and do nothing else. If the party ignores the
cultists and don't confront them in some way, well, that's neutral or
evil, but it ain't good. It's neutral to sit by and let (d)evil do its
work. It's good to fight evil.

The party has (of course) to make sure, that they are up against a
cult of devil worshippers. If they just follow the pointing finger of
the town's "angry old man", that ain't good.

Have you talked with the paladin and discussed and worked out the
details of this particular paladin's code?? Is his code oriented
towards exterminating evil like the pesky cockroaches that they are at
first glance, or is it a code that is more oriented towards "everyone
has some good in them, try to find that good, but defend yourself if
necessary"?

What about your other players, have you discussed with them where or
their alignment's scale they are?? What their motivations are? Are
they zealot-like LG devotees to a god, where the fact that the others
are worshipping an arch-devil is reason enough to lock the doorws and
burn them down, or are they worshippers of a god that is more mercy-
oriented.

That is the type of things you should be knowing about your players.

Otherwise, it sounds like a reason to screw the party/paladin.

Mmm, so for you every paladin when he/she wakes up in the morning should
check his list of evil god and say: "Let's see who I'm gonna to erase from
the Faerum's face today. Bane's, or Talona's or Gruumsh's or Llolth's or
Orcus' or Loviatar's or Tiamat's ecc.  cultists/temples".

However in some way you got the point: "...Do the cultists enlarge their
group? Do they try to gain new followers? Do they endanger the souls of the
innocent? Do they spread evil?..."

They don't know! Although improbable, for what they know about them, the
cultists could have isolated themselves from the rest of the world and breed
red and black dragons in order to sacrifice them later in their rituals...

To be fair to Oduf, I think the idea is if the party "passes the test"

the moral license to kill, ensuring a happy end for the party and the

It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, since it feels like a mockery
of Good: "Good thing those Evil cultists attacked us, so we could
slaughter them with impunity, eh? Say, imagine the inconvenience if
everyone suddenly converted to Good; we could never rescue that poor
trapped paladin's soul. I thank my Good gods for Evil cultists!"

Why is worshipping a devil evil per se?
(beside the arguments presented in the Book of Vile Darkness)
What were the tales of the characters' parents in their youth. Did
they tell them of the good devils, the good deeds of devils? No (I
hope). If the characters aren't all Kaspar Hausers, they learned that
devils are evil, that no good can come from a devil. In a D&amp;D world
evil is tangible, physical. Evil has a face, when it comes to evil
outsiders. The bedtime story can actually rip your heart out and
devour your soul. This aspect should frighten the hell (hehe) out of
the characters.

A devil is evil incarnate. It cannot repent. It cannot change its
ways. It is always lawful evil. That is a game mechanic.

People (humans and other mortals) have a free will. People can repent.
They can change their behaviour. Though most people would rate
themselves as lawful good, they are usually neutral (more than 50%).
So most people wouldn't act on devil worshippers in their backyard. A
good character won't stand this, because it learned early on that
devils are evil. What would a character think of a person who consorts
with fiends? If such a person can be swayed to see their wrongs, good.
If it can't be swayed, it is a menace to the society, to the lives and
souls of everyone and it must be dealt with (which means killed,
imprisoned or driven off). Can a good character stand by and watch? A
good character hopes for the redemption of wrong-doers and will give
the devil worshippers a chance to step aside.

When it comes to gods, it gets more complex. Gods don't have a fixed
alignment, they can change. A gods alignment isn't a game mechanic,
though it usually stays the same. In the D&amp;D multiverse this aspect is
expressed in the shifts of godly planes. Hell and heaven don't shift,
they are static (a metagame concept, a game mechanic). Devoted
followers of evil gods are usually evil themselves. What can a
character expect from a follower of a particular evil god? This
question is answered by the cultural background of the region the
characters act in. If the characters know that the followers of a
particular deity usually kill people, summon undead and commit other
atrocities, they would show a neutral behaviour, if the wouldn't act
on their knowledge. Have you ever wondered why evil temples tend to be
underground and not next to a temple devoted to a good deity? Mmh,
maybe you play it in another way.

So if you present the worship of devils as normal for the region and
you sell the actions of the cult as not evil, where has the paladin
come from? Not from that region is my guess. On what believes is
lawful good founded in your campaign?

It's hard to imagine a truly good "religion" requiring any blood

IMO Jasin is right; a Good ritual (to free a trapped soul) *should*
not require the life or blood of an Evil cleric - in fact it
shouldn't
require *any* life or blood in a normal DnD campaign.

Consider the question why it's neccessary. What happens to the
soul or spirit of the killed cleric? Or the cleric whose blood was
used? Is his soul consumed or does he lose a level?

Yeh, I mentioned this in my last post. An unwilling human sacrifice is
EVIL. Straightup always evil.

D&amp;D good is not less powerful than Evil. It is better at different
things than Evil and uses different methods than evil. Evil bound a
soul by murder, good can free the soul, but the method won't be
murder.

Heck, Mordekain's disjunction the sword. The party is of a level to be
killing Lich's permanently, getting a single spell cast should be

Of course.

And so are the cultists who breed Evil dragons for sacrifice, and if the

being sacrificed to devils, they've got enough reason to come barging

I agree with this statement.  Why not turn the blood sacrifice around
and require that the characters "make an evil cleric repent of his
ways and turn to good", or something like that?  Save the soul rather
than butcher the body.

Kind of like how Andrew was required to repent and shed a tear in

Not to mention you'd have to be a fairly evil person to get an evil

SRD:

"Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others.

So you are basically talking slavers, tyrants, thugs, murderers,
corrupt law enforcement, and what we call today "violent offenders".

As a merchant you have to be doing something pretty heinous such as
selling product that you know could injure or kill your customer with
a pretty good incidence of probability (obviously some leeway here,
like medicines, or situations where your customer knows this, but
nothing else is available, and there are borderline cases too like
tobacco).

A good for instance for the tavern keeper mentioned earlier would be
cutting or substituting wood alcohol (which can cause blindness or
death) for the real thing, beating his family/employees, and/or
killing and robbing guests.

Tyr, IIRC, God of War, Justice, that sort of thing??

Than if your paladin's player can justify going in and wiping out the

charging in) and it doesn't sound like too much of a stretch for the
code, than it should be fine. If, however, it sounds like he is trying

You could perhaps look at it as a conflict of interest.

If the headsman says, "May Pholtus have mercy on this soul" - Pholtus isn't
promised anything, and the god hasn't got a conflict of interest in the
condemned man's soul.
If the headsman says, "I commit this soul to Pholtus" - Pholtus has a stake
in what has happened, conflict of interest.

So, the beheading of murderers is acceptable at least to an "Arcadian" god
who is Good-leaning; but burning a heretic for the God's pleasure would
force the god into a lethal conflict of interest.

&gt; My (tainted?) opinion is, that devil worshippers are a threat to

&gt; share a cup of tea and do nothing else. If the party ignores the

&gt; evil, but it ain't good. It's neutral to sit by and let (d)evil do its
&gt; work. It's good to fight evil.

&gt; The party has (of course) to make sure, that they are up against a
&gt; cult of devil worshippers. If they just follow the pointing finger of
&gt; the town's &quot;angry old man&quot;, that ain't good.
">

Your scenario is not Lawful and that counts too. Also, if your paladin is
not careful, he's setting himself up for an altercation with factions in the
city who are also Lawful Good but have been called to the temple in order to
quell a disturbance. Being wilfully negligent of risks to alignment ought to
count against the alignment.

This school of "thought" is likely common to the city: "I'm friends with a
few Asmodeus worshippers. I don't exactly know what in Asmodeus's holy book,
given that it's written in a language I haven't bothered to learn, but the
worshippers are always nice to me. That proves that Asmodeus worship isn't
an evil religion!" Besides the useful idiots, the average Joe in the city is
a moderate who just wants to be left alone. He'll side with them until given
a reason to do otherwise.

The paladin is Good and cannot ignore the cult, but he is also Lawful and
cannot raid its outposts in the city. The best he can do, without cover of
law, is to gather evidence. Besides it's the smart thing to do; if he sneaks
into the temple then some poor sod who is just trying to sleep without
hearing lightning bolts cracking next door is going to call the guard.

But if you're on a mission from someone in the city government, then the
guard won't get involved. This requires finding out what actions are
allowable. If factions in the government don't want the temple disturbed,
then the intrustion will have to be a stealth mission. Think "James Bond".

This must be a rather peaceful world, if the party has to travel to the
boondocks to find an evil cleric. In most worlds, you could just roam
around in a bad neighborhood till you saw some innocent person being
attacked, and shed some evil blood while defending the innocent. And maybe
be ready to give the cleric a deathbed promotion.

Evil is as evil does. Why not look around for some evil deeds happening,
and go after the people doing them, in hopes one of those will be a cleric.

Or the party could do some sort of con themselves: offer something
attractive to clerics, with some evil deed required as payment. Any cleric
who took the bait would be likely to be evil, or soon to become so. If they
want to avoid 'entrapping' him, they could keep delaying the evil deed,
while shadowing the cleric, till he did something else evil (which they
would be on hand to foil).

Or, they could offer some rare artifact for sale to clerics, with a story
about it having been got in some evil way, or it having evil powers. Any
cleric who still wanted to buy it (or tried to steal it) would be a good
prospect.

Hm. Suppose they just put out the word in various circles that they are
seeking an evil cleric (presumably to offer him a job) and will give a
large finder's fee. Then they are referred to Zothan, a mysterious cleric
who is offering a very evil artifact for sale. They think Zothan must be
