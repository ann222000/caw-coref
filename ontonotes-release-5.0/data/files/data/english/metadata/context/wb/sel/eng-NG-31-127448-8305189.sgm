&gt; &gt; observable evolution in action where only a few dozen specified
&gt; &gt; residues are required, a few where a few hundred are required, but
&gt; &gt; absolutely none when more than 1000 are required? - not a single
&gt; &gt; example in all of literature.  How is this observation explained?

&gt; Why the bogus obfuscation?  Have I ever made any claims about a few
&gt; dozen whatevers?  I think the claim was that you can't even come up
&gt; with an example where three changes were required to get a selectable
&gt; function, and you never could come up with one.

Talk about strawman building and obfuscation - -  The 1,000aa
threshold is NOT a measure of any &quot;change&quot; or &quot;gap size&quot;.  You and
Howard Hershey constantly build this strawman no matter how many times
I've corrected you both on this otherwise elementary concept. Again,
as I've explained many many times before, the 1000aa threshold is a
measure of the absolute number of amino acid residues that have to be
in a specified arrangement before a particular type of function can be
realized - i.e., the minimum structural threshold requirement.

For example, flagellar motility requires a minimum of at least 10,000
residues for the motility part of the function to be realized.
Kenneth Miller's argument that 40 of the 50 or so proteins can be
removed without a complete loss of function (since the TTSS system
remains intact) completely misses the point.  The TTSS system does not
have the motility function of the flagellum.  This motility function
requires around 10,000 residues at minimum.  Without this minimum
structural threshold requirement in place the function of flagellar
motility cannot be realized at all - not even a little bit.

You do understand this fist very basic concept - right?  Perhaps not,
but for those who do, it is very easy to demonstrate that no type of
functional system that requires at least 1,000 specifically arranged
amino acid residues evolves in observable time. There is not a single
example in all of literature.

So, the question is, &quot;Why not?&quot;  Did you get that question Ron?  What
is your answer for this observation?  Why do systems with structural
threshold requirements of just a few amino acid residues evolve so
rapidly while those that require a few hundred evolve much less
commonly and those that require over 1,000aa never evolve at all in an
observable way?  What is your explanation for this exponential
stalling out effect of evolutionary potential?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your own math told
&gt; you that 2 or three were no problem
&gt; and you had to go with 10 or more,
&gt; remember?
">

This discussion concerned the minimum gap distance.  Remember Ron?  As
it turns out, the likely minimum gap distance increases in a linear
manner with each increase in the minimum structural threshold
requirements of the system in question.  The gap is not the same thing
as the minimum structural threshold requirements.  These are different
but related concepts. In other words, the 1000aa threshold is NOT the
gap distance.  It is just that this minimum threshold requirement
almost certainly produces a minimum gap distance between what is and
what might be beneficial that is much wider than a few dozen residue
changes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then you made the bogus jump to 1000 when you couldn't even
&gt; justify claims of 10.
">

You are very confused Ron.  This is because you really haven't spent
any time with the arguments at hand and still don't grasp the concept
that the 1000aa structural threshold requirement is not the same thing
as the gap distance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  I claim that there isn't a single instance of

&gt; suddenly my fault that you can't come up with an example of 12 changes
&gt; being required?  What kind of bogus argument is that?
">

The demonstration here is found in the exponential decline of
evolvability with increasing minimum structural threshold requirements
until evolution completely stalls out well shy of the 1000aa
threshold.  You haven't presented any counter arguments or
explanations to explain how this very real phenomenon might be the
result of some other cause beside the linear expanding gap problem
I've been proposing for many years now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remember the Hall junk that you used to claim meant something?  He
&gt; found that only 1 change was required to change ebg to having beta gal
&gt; activity.  Two changes made it even better.  He found this in an
&gt; organism with only around 2000 protein genes.  Only 2000 chances for a
&gt; sequence to be close enough to the desired activity to get there in 1
&gt; or two mutations.  Halls experimental methodology limited the number
&gt; of mutations required because it was a single step selection and at
&gt; best he could expect to select for double mutations.  He even repeated
&gt; it with other species of bacteria.  I believe your own references
&gt; cited 2 or 3 other bacteria that he could get to evolve beta gal
&gt; activity, but he might not have figured out which genes had been
&gt; altered in them.  Like he had in identifying the ebg gene in E. coli.
">

You continually forget that the minimum structural requirement for
lactase activity is only 400 or so fairly specified amino acid
residues.  That's the whole point Ron.  The E. coli in Hall's
experiment were successful because the functional system in question
has a relatively low minimum structural threshold requirement - not
even close to the 1,000 level.  The same thing is true of the famous
nylonase example that evolutionists love to quote.  As it turns out,
nylonase requires less of a structural threshold than the lactase
enzyme - only 280 or so residues.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your bogus argument fell apart and you finally did some off the cuff
&gt; calculations using expected evolutionary assumptions like mutation
&gt; selection balance and figured out that jumping short gaps of 2 or 3
&gt; were not as rare as you thought.
">

I never argued that jumping gaps of only 2 or 3 residues changes would
be hard for a bacterial colony at all.  I've always argued that
crossing such small gaps would be very easy in a very short period of
time - far more quickly than Hall's own calculations seemed to
indicate.  The problem's come when such small gap distances are not
longer likely to be present - i.e., when structural threshold's start
moving beyond minimum requirements of just a few hundred to over
1,000aa.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For those that don't know what that
&gt; is it just means that populations that exist for any length of time
&gt; would expect to reach mutation selection balance where the genetic
&gt; variation of a population would reach an equilibrium with new
&gt; mutations equalling the loss of existing mutations from the
&gt; population.  Populations have an amazing amount of genetic variation.
&gt; They don't have to rely on multiple simultaneous mutations.
">

Hall's bacteria actually did have to undergo at least 2 mutations
before the beneficial function of lactase activity could be realized.
Population variation did not come into play because Hall set up the
experiment based on a clonal population where the original genetic
sequence was already known as was identical at the start of the
experiment.

&gt; 4 being required.  No science paper that I know of have found such an
&gt; example.  Now he is trying to turn something that obviously
&gt; invalidates his 1000 argument into something that I have to worry
&gt; about.  My claim was that Sean couldn't come up with an example of 3
&gt; let alone 40 mutations being required.  Sean just convieniently

What Ron forgets, or perhaps never really grasped, is the concept that
the minimum structural threshold requirements for a system (i.e., like
1,000 specifically arranged residues) is not the same thing as the gap
distance.  Increasing the threshold does increase the gap distance,
but they are not the same thing.

What Ron and others like Howard Hershey don't seem to realize is that
tiny gap distances that are only 1 or 2 or 3 mutational changes wide
are not always the most likely minimum gap distance at every level of
minimum structural threshold requirements. The likely minimum gap
distances increase, in a linear manner, with each increase in the
structural threshold requirements.  So, by the time the requirements
are over 1,000aa, the odds that the gap distance between what is
beneficial and what might be beneficial is only a handful of changes
wide is next to impossible.  The actual gap distance at such levels
tends to follow a Poisson distribution making a gap of dozens of
changes much more likely to be the true gap distance at the 1000aa
minimum threshold.

This concept is what no one who frequents this forum, not Ron Okimoto,
Howard Hershey, Von Smith, Richard Baldwin, Richard Forrest, or anyone
else, has ever come close to explaining or even addressing without
giving up and resorting to the old standbys of endless pejoratives and
strawman mischaracterizations (many of which Ron just listed off
here).

The only &quot;goal&quot; here is to explain how evolution can actually work to
produce functional systems that have larger and larger minimum
structural threshold requirements.  You may argue that evolution
doesn't require this to happen and that's true.  However, you
evolutionists believe that it happened very commonly throughout a span
of only 4 billion years or so.  How could systems with very high
minimum structural threshold requirements have evolved?  You simply
state that when evolution happens it happens because the gaps were
small.  I couldn't agree more.  The problem is with your notion that
small gaps sizes could easily exist with minimum structural threshold
requirements at 1,000aa and far beyond.  That's the problem.  You
think the *likely* gap size is the smallest possible gap size (i.e.
&quot;one&quot;) regardless of the minimum structural threshold requirement for
the functional system in question.

That notion of yours is clearly mistaken as anyone can prove by simply
doing a BLAST search.  Systems with larger minimum structural
requirements than 1 or 2k amino acid residues are not just one or two
residue changes away from any other uniquely functional system.  And,
as the minimum requirements grow, so does the number of differences
one sees between it and the next closest uniquely functional system.
There is in fact a linear relationship between the minimum structural
threshold requirement of a system and its likely gap distance.  This
is a demonstrable fact.  Prove me wrong if you think otherwise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; For example, flagellar motility requires a minimum of at least
&gt; &gt; 10,000 residues for the motility part of the function to be realized.

&gt; That, however, is not the relevant number for evolution.  The relevant
&gt; number for evolution is the minimum number of mutations it takes to
&gt; *change* *existing* (at least potentially) *functional* sequences so
&gt; that they are *modified* to produce a *new* or *novel* function of
&gt; rotary motion of a whip.

&gt; The answer to that question has been answered.  The answer, in
&gt; principle (and in reality) is one.
">

Yeah - &quot;In principle&quot; the minimum gap size is just one mutational
change.  Again, what are the odds that the minimum possible gap size
will actually exist when you start looking at higher and higher
minimum structural threshold requirements?  That's the real question.
The odds do not stay the same.  That's the problem. They decrease
dramatically with each increase in the minimum structural threshold -
along a Poisson distribution.

No.  Evolution is about change, not size.  Change in *function*.
Generation of new *function*.  The fact is that evolution is highly
conservative of *structure* and *size* and *specificity* when it
generates new *function*.

Not that larger sized proteins are all that hard to make in single
mutational steps.  They are not made, as you seem to think, by adding
one aa at a time to some non-functional imaginary protein.  They are
made by the generation of chimeric fusion products due to deletion,
inversion, translocation, or an error in recombination producing a
chimeric protein.  Not only does this produce a larger protein, it
often produces one with added new *functional* moieties that were not
present in these particular combinations before.  [In fact, a sizeable
percentage of duplicates that are retained in eovlution are chimeric
in nature rather than simple duplication with a few added point
mutations.]  I gave you an example of how a deletion can produce a
chimeric protein (but not necessarily one larger than its parent
proteins) that can, in a single step, produce a *new* way of
generating rotational motility in bacteria that lacked that *function*
although they had structures that were similar *strucutrually and
functionally* to TTSS and to motor structures that also exist in
bacteria not as part of the flagellar system.  Larger proteins can
also be produced by endoduplication and also mutation of the usual
stop codon or a change in the intron border sequences (which can
produce alternate sized proteins from the same gene).

But you really don't seem happy with the fact that most proteins are
too small, so you then look at aggregations of proteins (such as
ribosomes or flagella) and treat them as if they were a single
protein.  The fact is that duplication and divergence (especially
subfunctionalization, which only requires loss of function) are common
events.  Once one has duplicates that have either become subfunctional
or neofunctional, the size of the complex would, according to you have
doubled.  But without any *change* but a duplication and a different
*loss* of partial function in both of the genes.  Over time, of
course, such subfunctionalization can lead to irreducible complexity.
But, of course, you have a teleological mindset and assume that
proteins can only do one thing, their teleological function.  You hold
that despite knowing that a flagella which is immotile can still
transport proteins outside the bacteria.

&gt; structural threshold requirements.
">

You always exaggerate what evolution must do to get a new function.
Increasing the size of a protein or the number of proteins in a
complex is not accomplished by any mechanism where the &quot;structural
threshold&quot; (aka size) gets changed in one aa increments.  Why do you
think that even Darwin described evolution as &quot;descent with (and by)
modification&quot;.  No system in any organism was made by a mechanism
where the size of the structural threshold was relevant.  The only
relevant feature, as far as evolution is concerned, is the *size of
the gap*.

You have repeatedly claimed that I think you mean that 1000 aa is the
size of the gap (see quote below).  I don't.  But if 1000 aa is the
only number you present (and one that you seem to *think* is related
to the number you *really* need, the size of the gap, it is my duty,
as an honest person, to remind you *time after time after time* that
the 1000aa number is irrelevant *unless* you can present a formula by
which one can calculate the number you do need: the minimum size of
the gap, or, at a minimum, and far less useful, the average gap +/- a
variance.  Yet you never do anything but assert without evidence that
there is a mathematical (either linear or exponential) relationship of
some sort between the size of the protein (or system) in aa and the
number you do need.  Do you realize how frustrating it is to have to
keep reminding you of a fact that you readily admit to? That the
number you need, but never present in your arguments, is the gap
size.  And that merely handwaving (or pulling a number out of yer
arse) is no substitute for a real mathematically precise and tested
hypothesis linking total size and gap size.

**********Sean speaking*****
Talk about strawman building and obfuscation - -  The 1,000aa
threshold is NOT a measure of any &quot;change&quot; or &quot;gap size&quot;.  You and
Howard Hershey constantly build this strawman no matter how many times
I've corrected you both on this otherwise elementary concept.
*********End Sean*******

Since I am not making that strawman, but merely reminding you (time
after time after time) that the 1000 number is irrelevant and that the
number you really need is never presented except by waving it into
existence, I feel agrieved and insulted.

&gt; You may argue that evolution

I've told you how larger proteins can be made.  Proteins *like* to
interact with each other, so explaining aggregation of proteins is not
too difficult.  Most interactions vary in strength.

&gt; You simply

&gt; think the *likely* gap size is the smallest possible gap size (i.e.
&gt; &quot;one&quot;) regardless of the minimum structural threshold requirement for
&gt; the functional system in question.

Yes.  That is the problem.  But as I see it, the problem is that you
have not presented any evidence to support the hypothesis that the
systems that have evolved and that new functionality in particular,
regardless of the size of the protein(s) involved, did so or needed to
do so by crossing large gaps.

You keep asserting that there is a mathematical relationship between
total size and gap size.  I have yet to see that equation nor any
evidence supporting the hypothesis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That notion of yours is clearly mistaken as anyone can prove by simply
&gt; doing a BLAST search.  Systems with larger minimum structural
&gt; requirements than 1 or 2k amino acid residues are not just one or two
&gt; residue changes away from any other uniquely functional system.
">

Examples?  And how long since the system diverged?  That is crucial
because a lot of both selective and non-selective changes will occur
in sequences over long periods of time.  And these changes would not
necessarily affect the basic *function*; they would optimize it.
Again, a mutation that produces the loss of rotary motility (a single
point mutation can do this) does not necessarily affect the ability to
transport proteins by the flagellin tube, some of which still do
function for this purpose as well as being a flagella.  Again, you
seem to think that flagella only has a single function rather than
having proteins that each have an independent function that is still
there if another protein has mutated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   And,
&gt; as the minimum requirements grow, so does the number of differences
&gt; one sees between it and the next closest uniquely functional system.

So you keep asserting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is in fact a linear relationship between the minimum structural
&gt; threshold requirement of a system and its likely gap distance.  This
&gt; is a demonstrable fact.  Prove me wrong if you think otherwise.
">

Show me the math and the logic and evidence that allowed you to
generate it.  [I ask for the last because you have a habit of
producing formulas that are supposed to be descriptive of empirical
reality that mean nothing or don't mean what you say they do.  Just
like you call what is basically &quot;total size&quot; a &quot;minimum structural
threshold&quot;]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, flagellar motility requires a minimum of at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10,000 residues for the motility part of the function to be realized.

&gt; &gt; That, however, is not the relevant number for evolution.  The relevant
&gt; &gt; number for evolution is the minimum number of mutations it takes to
&gt; &gt; *change* *existing* (at least potentially) *functional* sequences so
&gt; &gt; that they are *modified* to produce a *new* or *novel* function of
&gt; &gt; rotary motion of a whip.

&gt; &gt; The answer to that question has been answered.  The answer, in

&gt; some existing protein changing to something else.  If that is your
&gt; argument then you have none.
">

I'm not suggesting that a protein-based system has to evolve from
scratch either.  Start with whatever starting point you want.  Novel
protein-based systems that require a threshold of at least 1000
specifically arranged amino acid residues will not be able to evolve
from any gene pool you choose in existence today even given trillions
of years of time.  Why not?  Because, the 1000aa threshold, although
not the gap distance itself, creates a gap that is several dozens of
mutations wide.

Again, the 1000aa threshold is NOT the gap distance.  However, it is
associated with a minimum gap distance for populations of even
billions of individuals that is dozens of mutations wide.  It is the
linear increase in the gap distance with each increase in the minimum
structural threshold requirements that creates the problem for the
proposed evolutionary mechanism.  Each linear increase in the minimum
gap distance translates into an exponential increase in the average
number of mutational steps needed to cross the gap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you made the bogus jump to 1000 when you couldn't even

&gt; &gt; You are very confused Ron.  This is because you really haven't spent
&gt; &gt; any time with the arguments at hand and still don't grasp the concept
&gt; &gt; that the 1000aa structural threshold requirement is not the same thing
&gt; &gt; as the gap distance.

&gt; If it isn't then the argument is so lame that even you probably know
&gt; that you are just blowing smoke.  Name anyone that believes that you
&gt; have to assemble a thousand amino acids to evolve some protein
&gt; function.  Anyone except the creationist scam artists that you have to
&gt; admit lied to you about the science of ID.
">

I never said that you have to assemble 1000aa from scratch.  That is
why the 1000aa is not the same thing as the gap distance.  Again, the
1000aa is a threshold that defines certain types of functional systems
that require at least 1000 specifically arranged amino acid residues
to work at all.  Much of the 1000aa requirement may already exist
preformed within a given gene pool.  However, odds are that at least a
few dozen mutations would be needed before the minimum structural
threshold requirements of a new unique system with threshold
requirements at or beyond this limitation could be realized.  It is
this few dozen needed mutations that is the &quot;gap distance&quot;.

The minimum possible gap distance is, of course, always one.  This is
true regardless of the minimum structural threshold requirements under
consideration.  The problem is that this minimum possible gap distance
is not always the most likely gap distance.  It is all about the odds
that the gap distance will be small - like one or two steps wide.
These odds drop, quite dramatically, along a Poisson distribution as
one considers functional systems with greater and greater minimum
structural threshold requirements.  Very quickly the likely minimum
gap distance is no longer just one mutation wide - but dozens of
mutations wide.  By the time such a minimum gap distance is produced,
the average time required to evolve something new at such a level of
minimum structural threshold requirements has moved into trillions
upon trillions of years of average time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I claim that there isn't a single instance of
&gt; &gt; &gt; where 12 changes were required because we've haven't found any that
&gt; &gt; &gt; required 12.  Demonstrate differently.  You never could, now it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly my fault that you can't come up with an example of 12 changes
&gt; &gt; &gt; being required?  What kind of bogus argument is that?

&gt; &gt; The demonstration here is found in the exponential decline of
&gt; &gt; evolvability with increasing minimum structural threshold requirements
&gt; &gt; until evolution completely stalls out well shy of the 1000aa
&gt; &gt; threshold.  You haven't presented any counter arguments or
&gt; &gt; explanations to explain how this very real phenomenon might be the
&gt; &gt; result of some other cause beside the linear expanding gap problem
&gt; &gt; I've been proposing for many years now.

&gt; Now you seem to be mixing gap with your bogus assertion about how
&gt; proteins evolve.  Face it Sean the thousand amino acids essentially
&gt; already existed.  Small changes in the protein structure would have
&gt; accounted for the evolution of the proteins needed for flagellar
&gt; structure.  Why can we tell what proteins a lot of the flagellar
&gt; proteins evolved from if this were not true?  Where did the ATPases
&gt; come from?  They didn't evolve denovo did they?
">

The question here is &quot;how small&quot; are the changes that are required
Ron?  For systems that have a minimum structural threshold requirement
of only a few hundred loosely specified residues, the minimum number
of changes for at least one member of a huge population of bacteria is
most likely just a handful of mutations.  However, when you start
talking about minimum threshold requirements of over 1000aa, the
minimum number of changes is no longer just a handful. Rather, it is
on the order of dozens of mutations.

Look it up and see if you do not discover a pattern - a pattern of
increased minimum differences for higher and higher level systems that
increases in a linear manner with each increase in the minimum
structural threshold requirements of the systems in question.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember the Hall junk that you used to claim meant something?  He
&gt; &gt; &gt; found that only 1 change was required to change ebg to having beta gal

&gt; &gt; &gt; organism with only around 2000 protein genes.  Only 2000 chances for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; sequence to be close enough to the desired activity to get there in 1
&gt; &gt; &gt; or two mutations.  Halls experimental methodology limited the number
&gt; &gt; &gt; of mutations required because it was a single step selection and at
&gt; &gt; &gt; best he could expect to select for double mutations.  He even repeated
&gt; &gt; &gt; it with other species of bacteria.  I believe your own references
&gt; &gt; &gt; cited 2 or 3 other bacteria that he could get to evolve beta gal
&gt; &gt; &gt; activity, but he might not have figured out which genes had been
&gt; &gt; &gt; altered in them.  Like he had in identifying the ebg gene in E. coli.

&gt; &gt; You continually forget that the minimum structural requirement for
&gt; &gt; lactase activity is only 400 or so fairly specified amino acid
&gt; &gt; residues.  That's the whole point Ron.  The E. coli in Hall's
&gt; &gt; experiment were successful because the functional system in question
&gt; &gt; has a relatively low minimum structural threshold requirement - not
&gt; &gt; even close to the 1,000 level.  The same thing is true of the famous
&gt; &gt; nylonase example that evolutionists love to quote.  As it turns out,
&gt; &gt; nylonase requires less of a structural threshold than the lactase
&gt; &gt; enzyme - only 280 or so residues.

&gt; And you know that it higher for something else, how?  Who claimed that
&gt; 400 specified amino acids were required?

Do a BLAST search Ron.  See if you can find a useful lactase enzyme
(in a bacterial colony) that uses significantly less than 400 or so
amino acid residues.  Every type of functional system has a minimum
structural threshold requirement that, if not reached, will not
provide a reproductive advantage to a particular type of life form -
such as a bacterial life form. For the lactase function in bacteria,
it turns out that this minimum requirement is around 400aa.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Lame unsupported assertions

&gt; acids,

That isn't the most trimmed down version available.  Much smaller
lactases can be used to at least some advantage.  But, the limit
appears to be at around 400aa (380aa is the smallest one I've been
able to find).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The product of the ebg-gene is was also around 1000aa.  Again though,
this isn't the minimum requirement.  It is the minimum structural
requirement that is statistically important here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why couldn't beta
&gt; gal activity evolve in a smaller protein?

Because lactase activity has a minimum structural threshold
requirement just like all functional systems have.  Different types of
systems have different minimum requirements.  It turns out that the
lactase system in bacteria have a threshold requirement that appears
to be around 400aa.

To a useful approximation . . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The limit matters because those systems with smaller limits are much
easier to evolve than are those systems with larger limits.  Why?
Because, statistically, a smaller limit will have much greater odds of
being close to pre-existing sequences in a large gene pool.

When I start new threads asking you questions it is because you have

questions as a new thread to give you the opportunity of answering
them.

So let's watch you evade once again, shall we Sean? I know you won't
address this, because you are a moral and intellectual coward, so I
post it merely to demonstrate that fact rather than in the expectation
of a meaningful response. Please note that I have asked you this
question six times, and you have always ignored it.

You go on and on about the exceptional preservation of the Santana
formation fish fossils, though you carefully avoid reading any of the
scientific literature on the subject. It doesn't matter if the fish
were preserved in a matter of hours, days, weeks or years. We have
good experimental evidence that preservation of soft tissues of this
kind can occur in timescales of days. Such preservation is *not*
achieved simply by &quot;sudden burial, as in a flood&quot;.

However, the overwhelmingly vast majority of the fossil record is NOT*
preserved in lagerstatten such as the Crato Formation. It's logically
incoherent to offer exceptional preservation in a single, limited
locality as evidence for a global flood when most of the fossil record
is *NOT* exceptionally well-preserved.

Your have stated that: &quot;most fossils show clear evidence of rapid
burial or other forms of relatively rapid or even catastrophic
preservation leaving little time for predation or bioturbation)&quot;

This is plainly ridiculous, as anyone who has ever collected fossils
can tell you. Mike Benton, in the reference which I have provided,
writes

&quot;Animal and plant remains are typically buried after a great deal of
scavenging, decay, breakage and transport.&quot;

What do you know that Mike Benton doesn't?

Again it doesn't matter what you think it is, what matters is what it
is, and it is just unsupported assertion based on nothing that you can
demonstrate.  Not a gap, but associated with a gap and you treat it
like a gap, but it isn't really a gap.  What a crock.  Do you actually
read the junk that you write?  Does it matter?  Just do something
simple and demonstrate that your 1000aa threshold means anything.
There must be some research that you have done and calculations that
you have made so lay out the details.  Unsupported assertion is not
laying out any details.  You can't just claim that it must be this
way, you have to be able to demonstrate it.  Not only that, but you
have to be able to demonstrate that whatever this 1000aa threshold
turns out to be that it is at all relevant to the argument that you
are trying to make.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then you made the bogus jump to 1000 when you couldn't even

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are very confused Ron.  This is because you really haven't spent
&gt; &gt; &gt; any time with the arguments at hand and still don't grasp the concept
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the 1000aa structural threshold requirement is not the same thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the gap distance.

&gt; &gt; If it isn't then the argument is so lame that even you probably know
&gt; &gt; that you are just blowing smoke.  Name anyone that believes that you
&gt; &gt; have to assemble a thousand amino acids to evolve some protein
&gt; &gt; function.  Anyone except the creationist scam artists that you have to
&gt; &gt; admit lied to you about the science of ID.

&gt; I never said that you have to assemble 1000aa from scratch.  That is
&gt; why the 1000aa is not the same thing as the gap distance.  Again, the
&gt; 1000aa is a threshold that defines certain types of functional systems
&gt; that require at least 1000 specifically arranged amino acid residues
&gt; to work at all.  Much of the 1000aa requirement may already exist
&gt; preformed within a given gene pool.  However, odds are that at least a
&gt; few dozen mutations would be needed before the minimum structural
&gt; threshold requirements of a new unique system with threshold
&gt; requirements at or beyond this limitation could be realized.  It is
&gt; this few dozen needed mutations that is the &quot;gap distance&quot;.

Demonstrate it.  Show that a dozen mutations have had to be crossed in
one step to get a selectable function.  Why can't you do that?  Why do
you think that you have a valid argument when you can't do that.

Don't you even keep track of the ID claptrap.  They have faced this
same problem for over a decade.  Don't you know what they admit about
it?  They admit that they have to demonstrate that every possible
evolutionary pathway to a certain selectable function is too
improbable for their argument to hold water.  Since they don't even
know what all the possible evolutionary pathways are they gave up.
Dembski promised to do it, but all he came up with was the stupid
tornado through a junk yard probability argument that he admitted was
not biologically relevant.  To make the biologically relevant argument
you have to determine what existed and the probability that it could
change to the new function.  You can't even start to do that.  The
other ID scam artists didn't even try.  So what does that say about
this worthless argument?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The minimum possible gap distance is, of course, always one.  This is
&gt; true regardless of the minimum structural threshold requirements under

&gt; that the gap distance will be small - like one or two steps wide.
&gt; These odds drop, quite dramatically, along a Poisson distribution as
&gt; one considers functional systems with greater and greater minimum
&gt; structural threshold requirements.  Very quickly the likely minimum
&gt; gap distance is no longer just one mutation wide - but dozens of
&gt; mutations wide.  By the time such a minimum gap distance is produced,
&gt; the average time required to evolve something new at such a level of

I thought that we weren't talking about gaps.  There seems to be a big
gap somewhere, but it isn't in protein sequence space.

Face it you can't back this up and the only evidence that you have
says that you are wrong.  How does your immune system work to keep you
alive if this were even close to being true?  Why can you develop
enzyme activities in antibodies, and antibodies can be made to
synthetic antigens that have not been seen in nature before.  You just
claim that this isn't the type of gap that you are talking about, but
you don't know that.  You can't even demonstrate it.  You just assert
it because your argument doesn't hold water in the face of reality.
This is protein sequence evolution on a rapid scale and if it had to
cross your exponential gaps you would be probably be dead.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly my fault that you can't come up with an example of 12 changes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being required?  What kind of bogus argument is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The demonstration here is found in the exponential decline of
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolvability with increasing minimum structural threshold requirements
&gt; &gt; &gt; until evolution completely stalls out well shy of the 1000aa
&gt; &gt; &gt; threshold.  You haven't presented any counter arguments or

&gt; &gt; structure.  Why can we tell what proteins a lot of the flagellar
&gt; &gt; proteins evolved from if this were not true?  Where did the ATPases
&gt; &gt; come from?  They didn't evolve denovo did they?

&gt; The question here is &quot;how small&quot; are the changes that are required
&gt; Ron?  For systems that have a minimum structural threshold requirement
&gt; of only a few hundred loosely specified residues, the minimum number
&gt; of changes for at least one member of a huge population of bacteria is
&gt; most likely just a handful of mutations.  However, when you start
&gt; talking about minimum threshold requirements of over 1000aa, the
&gt; minimum number of changes is no longer just a handful. Rather, it is
&gt; on the order of dozens of mutations.

For a specific system, tell us the minimum and then demonstrate that
it didn't exist.  Show us the protein sequences and how they would

&gt; &gt; He posts it again so that he can give the impression to other
&gt; &gt; creationists that he is a scientist making valid scientific arguments
&gt; &gt; which &quot;evolutionists&quot; cannot falsify. He knows the creationists are so

&gt; &gt; So basically, he reposts it so that he can gain status in the

&gt; &gt; I think that this shows contempt for his own side in the argument. I

&gt; The problem with that hypothesis is that if this were so, he is posting

&gt; Very few creationists hang out here, really, and nearly all of those are

&gt; &gt; What happened to the gap distance bogousity?  If you aren't talking
&gt; &gt; about the gap bogousity than you aren't talking about anything
&gt; &gt; relevant to evolutionary biology.  No one claims that a protein has to

&gt; &gt; some existing protein changing to something else.  If that is your
&gt; &gt; argument then you have none.

&gt; I'm not suggesting that a protein-based system has to evolve from

More hand-waving assertion of the *supposed* relationship between

Before you can make a claim that a linear increase in gap size
translates into an exponential increase in average number of
mutational steps needed to cross the gap, you have to demonstrate that
there *actually* is a linear increase in gap size with increasing
total size.  I haven't seen that evidence at all.  But if one assumes
that your hand-waving number that you apparently pulled out of yer
arse is 60 mutational steps for a protein of size of 1000 [your hand-
waving number was &quot;several dozen&quot;, which is too vague to be useful, so
I chose the maximum number for &quot;several&quot; as 5], what you seem to be
saying is that, on average, for a new function to arise, about 6% of
any (the average?) existing ancestral protein's sequence *must* change
in a completely neutral fashion, with intermediate states having no
functional utility at all, to produce a protein that has any sort of
useful altered function.  [You can correct me if I am wrong, but since
you have repeatedly and repeatedly and repeatedly failed to actually
discuss this hypothetical and crucial relationship, I must.]  Is this
correct?  And what empirical evidence do you have that it is correct?

Of course, we both know that this *average* protein would not be the
one that evolution uses as the starting point.  But you must at least
start with some sort of argument.

But you *do* keep asserting, without ever presenting supporting
evidence or an actual equation, that there is a linear correlation of
some sort between total size of a protein and the number of mutational
steps needed to evolve a &quot;new&quot; function (which you haven't defined
adequately -- does acquiring a &quot;new&quot; function mean that the &quot;old&quot;
function must cease to exist?  At what point does modification of
function equal &quot;new&quot;?  Can functions 'emerge' from quantitative
changes?  Is a change of optimum to a secondary substrate a &quot;new&quot;
function?).

This is real simple math even you should be able to do:  You claim
that there is an equation of the form y = bn (I am assuming that the y
intercept is 0 when n = 0), where y is the gap size, n is the size of
the &quot;minimum threshold&quot; or total size, and b is the linear
relationship between total size and gap size.  b should be obtainable
by looking at real data for the evolution of &quot;new&quot; functions from old
proteins.  But you don't seem to actually present this equation nor
the evidence that you use to determine b (which you *repeatedly* claim
exists).

Yet, as you say, what really matters wrt whether something can or
cannot evolve is what proteins (particularly *structure* more than
*sequence*) actually exists in any given cell, not any hypothetical
*average* gap distance.

This does assume that the hypothetical linear relationship exists as a
linear relationship regardless of the total size.  And it does assume
that evolution is teleological in that it produces *functions*
regardless of the size of the gap needed to produce that function.
Instead most people think that evolution only happens when the size of
any gap between useful functions is relatively small.  IOW, the
average gap size in a theoretical sequence space is irrelevant when
the only events that actually happened are those that are on a tail
end.  And one consequence of such a non-average evolution is that
structures of life (structure is a better indicator of function than
sequence) should be clustered and appear in those clusters as organic
outgrowth rather than random scatter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Very quickly the likely minimum
&gt; gap distance is no longer just one mutation wide - but dozens of

Now you have switched from the *average* gap distance to the &quot;likely
minimum gap distance&quot;.  As *you* pointed out the &quot;minimum gap
distance&quot; is always one.  And evolution almost always works by the
smallest *available* gap distance between functional states and is non-
teleological.  Wouldn't that merely mean that the evolution that *did*
happen happened when the &quot;minimum gap distance&quot; is small enough to
cross.  I have no idea how you calculate the &quot;likely&quot; minimum gap size
as anything more than one.  At what point does one become &quot;unlikely&quot;
even if the *average* gap size is 60 (as, if you accept my numbers, it
would be for a total size of 1000)?  Does that mean that you think
there is a very small variance?  How did you calculate that variance?
Given that there are thousands of species and millions of years, at
what % of all possible likelihoods is the probability of 1 (or less
than, say, three) too small to be possible even if the *average* gap
size is 60?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the average time required to evolve something new at such a level of
&gt; minimum structural threshold requirements has moved into trillions

So you keep asserting.  But I certainly have seen no actual argument
