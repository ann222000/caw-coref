LOL.
I am sure there are many Native Americans who would, eagerly, sign up
for duty on that team.

I hate spics, and I'm not even white.

I just know from personal experience that these people, as a group,
are really full of themselves, and will make you feel like a foreigner
in your own country. Â I'm not aware of previous generations of
immigrants proposing to turn America into another Italy, or Ireland,
or Denmark (though that wouldn't be so bad), or Germany (except for a
relative very few at one time), but these spics will turn the nation
into another cesspool of crap, just like their own countries, just
like any neighborhood that's got a lot of 'em...they actually talk
about taking over, and the liberals are clueless Neville
Chamberlains....

They sold us the land- and there wasn't a concept of 'illegal alien' until
after the Federalist War on the States.
Besides, as a warrior culture, amerindians knew the consequences of losing-
they were lucky that we're the kindest conquerors the world has ever known.
In fact, amerindians are very opposed to the Southern Invasion from Mexico,
as they've been hereditary enemies since the time of the Aztecs. The
amerindians at Mesa Verde were probably eaten by those Southern indians.
Interestingly, the reconquista is now being packaged as an Indian movement,
and the organized amerindians want nothing to do with it- find it insulting
at best.

Look up Kennewick Man sometime.

A skeleton withsome of the characteristics of a Caucasian who seems to
predate the &quot;native Americans&quot;.

They - of course - tried hard to suppress the find and bury the bones
prior to the investigatioin.

I believe the lastest theories are that the Kennewick Man is likely
not of European stock.
