The title. Ah yes. It is of course a pun on possibly Mozart's greatest hit, the Serenade K.525 in G for strings "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". It isn't, unfortunately, my pun. It comes from a very clever bloke called Peter Schickele. Peter has many claims to fame. He's a composer, with a lot of music to his credit. He wrote the soundtrack for Douglas Trumbull's science fiction film "Silent Running" (starring Bruce Dern). He provided arrangements for a number of Joan Baez's hit albums back in the seventies. He arranged and combined the Elgar's three Pomp and Circumstance marches for Disney's "Fantasia 2000". He used to form one-third of a wonderful ensemble called The Open Window: they produced one self-titled album and also provided the bulk of the music for "Oh Calcutta!".

If that’s the music to his credit, Peter Schickele is far better known for the music to his discredit. As his many fans will know, I am referring to those pieces supposedly composed by JS Bach’s oddest offspring, P.D.Q. Bach (1807 – 1742?). these include such gems as “Iphigenia In Brooklyn”, the “Bluegrass Cantata”, “Hansel and Gretel and Ted and Alice” and the “Missa Hilarious”. From time to time when creating P.D.Q.Bach recordings Peter slips in a piece in a similar vein but written under his own name. Such is “Eine Kleine Nichtmusik”, a piece for orchestra where (in essence) the strings play the Mozart original pretty much unaltered, while the wind and brass transmogrify it beyond redemption by the addition of quotations from all manner of other pieces. Brahms, Beethoven, Rimsky-Korsakov, Stephen Foster, Stravinsky… Once you have heard the theme of the rondo turn itself into the “Apparition Of Petrouchka’s Double” or the horn theme from Till Eulenspiegel”, you are doomed to be unable to hear the original without giggling.

The combination of musical eclecticism and bad puns thrust the title upon me. And I hadn’t the heart to resist it .

Is Bruce Dern related to Laura Dern?

Sorry, I am a bit of a dimwit where classical music is concerned... although I had heard of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.

And The Trout.

Bruce Dern is Laura Dern's dad. According to IMDB he's one of the very few actors to have killed John Wayne on-screen.

April, hi, welcome aboard.

Clare -

The Trout (the quintet, that is, rather than the original song) reminds me these days of Vikram Seth's "An Equal Music". Good story; hard for me to say how much you'd miss by not being a classical music geek, but since it probably sold more copies than there are geeks I guess not too much. I commend it.

And *of course* you'd heard of EKN (the serenade, not the blog). Have you ever seen "Amadeus"? There's a bit where Salieri (second-division composer from Mozart's time) is humming his greatest hits and trying to get someone to recognise them, with no success at all. Then he hums a couple of notes of EKN and the guy joins in.

"Oh, that's lovely! I didn't know you wrote that!"....
(pause)....
(through gritted teeth)"I didn't."

The point being that all Salieri's stuff had been completely eclipsed by the New Kid On The Block.

I don't know if EKN was the first piece of classical music I ever heard, but it was undoubtedly the first I was able to hum. And (unlike the Trout) it's dead easy to play.

I can sing the Trout (the song)!

I was brung up by middle class academics who loved nothing better than to embarrass the mortal hell out of me by demanding I do such things as sing impromptu classical duets in public.

Did you not hear my lady
Go down the garden singing...

....Frightening all the squirrels
And setting the railings ringing....

Yes, I know that one.

I used to work beside a woman who reckoned "The Trout" was OK until you got to "But skilful was the angler". As she said, hooray for the bloody angler, what about the poor bloody trout?

Hope your accompanist for the Schubert was up to the task...

There was no accompanist. Not unless my uncle Ian happened to be about.

I'm trying to remember what the other duet is my mum likes. She carries the sheet music around in her handbag. She still makes me sing it.

Ah yes, The Lark In The Clear Air.

Dear thoughts are in my mind
Though my soul soars enchanted
As I hear the sweet lark sing
In the clear air of the day.

I confess I have a secret affection for these songs. Although I do also think The Lark, particularly, is bloody awful.

Joe

If you only read two blogs so far, I commend you to all the ones on my newly-minted blogroll. Or was the "double the fun" a bit like Geldof's "1,000,000 people" in Edinburgh?
