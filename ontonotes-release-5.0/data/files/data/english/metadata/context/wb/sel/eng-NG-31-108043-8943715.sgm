Place:  Harkhun Rausmauer's apartment
Time:  4 AM

With the revelation that the guard is swigging contraband, the party
feels confident now that he is the thief, or is connected to the thief
in some way.  They can't explain how he passed the &quot;Zone of Truth&quot; tests
House Kundarak administered to their employees, but tying this new
discovery in with what the kobolds told them is far too meaningful to be
a coincidence.  The party needs to report back in to Darik d'Kundarak
and let him know what they've found.  They also need to find a way to
find out exactly how the papers are stolen and where they've gone.

So the party heads uptower to get breakfast and then await the opening
of Kundarak Bank for the day.  Once inside, Tolmurg meets the party in
Darik's office and says he is too ill to have visitors, but he listens
as Debir (the party's default leader) briefs him on their discoveries.
Debir urges Tolmurg not to do anything with Harkhun yet, as they have
not completed their investigation, and firing or gaoling him might cut
off their only path back to their goal.

Tired, the party members then retire to their homes for some rest--or,
in the case of the two warforged, discussion at the Red Hammer Inn.

Date:  12 Nymm, 998
Place:  Kundarak Vault #17, Tavick's Landing
Time:  5 PM

The party re-gathers at the vault just as the office is closing for the
day.  There they find a distressed Kessen d'Kundarak waiting for them,
and he hurries them into his office.  As they enter, they pass Harkhun
in his guard outfit by the main corridor to the vault.  He clearly shows
the hard night he had, both in the aftereffects of the dreamlilly and
his pasting at the hands of the half-ogre, but he doesn't acknowledge
Debir or the others.

Kessen closes the door and sits behind his desk, sighing.  There is
someone else in the office, a hobgoblin in rough but clean clothing and
carrying a small package.  At his belt is a wicked-looking bastard
sword, well-used in appearance.  He is clearly upset.

Kessen introduces him as Yuzz'n Nakha, the client who rents a locker for
Morgrave University.   He explains that Yuzz'n came in today to add
something to his locker, and found that it was empty.  He wanted to know
what had happened to his belongings.  The tone in Kessen's voice was as
hard as granite, and it did not take a Sense Motive check to realize
that Kessen would like an answer for that as well.

Lore, who has the highest Charisma, explains that they were afraid the
belongings might have been targeted for theft and so they were moved to
another location--only they knew where--for safekeeping, and as soon as
it was safe, they would be returned.

Yuzz'n looks at Kessen, who looks at Debir, who looks at Lore, who nods.
Kessen then weakly nods as well.

Fuming, Yuzz'n leaps out of his chair and growls &quot;I knew I should not
trust the dwarves.  They always sell you out in the end.  You!&quot;  he
says, shaking his orange finger at Lore, &quot;had better bring my goods back
right away.  I give you three days, and then I'm bringing in the
lawyers.  And you!&quot; he says, swiveling to point at Kessen, &quot;had better
be ready to answer for this to the directors of the University.  There
are other security companies in Sharn, who would love to have our
business.&quot;  With that, he flings open the door and stomps out.

There is silence as Lyrial softly arises and gently closes the door
after Debir and Vrim make an exit after the departing hobgoblin.  Kessen
looks at the party, and finally says, &quot;There had better be a good
explanation for this.&quot;

Lore explains Diplomatically that it was necessary to throw any real
thieves off the trail of the goods until they could be snared.  They
explained about the &quot;Arcane Marks&quot; they had discovered and how they
would somehow be the key to solving the crimes.

The streets of Sharn are crowded, it is true, but even there one can see
the disturbances in a crowd and follow the ripples, as in a pond.
Though neither one is skilled in shadowing a target, they try to stay
hidden from Yuzz'n as they trail his wake towards the nearest set of
ramps spiraling around the tower where the vault is located.  Curiously,
Yuzz'n does not take the uptower route towards the bridges that lead to
Morgrave University; instead, he takes the lower and more sooty ramp
that leads down into the Cogs.

Intrigued, the pair try to follow but are stopped suddenly when a pair
of halfings dressed in leather step out in front of them.  The city
halflings wear their hair slicked back with a greasy pomade, and
earrings glitter in their small ears.  They grin mirthlessly at the
party, and one of them says, &quot;Sorry, guv'nor, this ramp's closed.&quot;

A few citizens make their way past them down the ramp.  Debir says,
&quot;They seem to be going down OK.&quot;  The halflings shakes his head and
says, &quot;Well, yer see, it's only closed to you.  Now slap yer soles
elsewhere, as the strumpet said to the fisherman.&quot;  His fingers seem to
blur for a second and then, as if by magic, a sharp-looking dagger
appeared in his hand.

Snickering, Vrim draws his sword but suddenly as if out of nowhere more
halflings appear and strike from all sides, surprising the pair and
wounding them grievously.  Both fall to the ground, and the halflings
saunter off, leaving the crowds to watch from a distance but not help.

Debir, who had only been pretending to be struck down, is able to drag
Vrim over to the side and try to bind his wounds.  Eventually, Vrim
awakens and staggers groggily to his feet.  By this time, both Yuzz'n
and the halfling marauders were long gone.  The pair return to the
vault, where Bot heals their injuries.  (&quot;Flesh bags,&quot; he chuckles to
himself as he works.)

Debir describes the encounter to his comrades.  Lyrial, the most
streetwise of the group, says that they sound like Boromar clan
enforcers.  Among other rackets, such as extortion, they are known to
import contraband like dreamlilly from Droaam.  The group now wonders if
the Boromar clan might be the ones behind the theft of the papers.  They
need to have another talk with Harkhun, it seems, and this one more
personal.

Taking off for the Drunken Monkey, the party finds him with his usual
friends, drinking away like mad.  Rather than confront him there, they
bide their time until he leaves, but when he does he is not alone.  Two
of his buddies go back to his place with him, and enter his apartment
together as they slur their words.  Frustrated, the party then decides
to wait another day.

Place:  Kundarak Vault #17, Tavick's Landing
Time:  8 AM

The party returns to the vault at opening time, intending to hit up
Harkhun when he arrives for the day.  He shows up, bright and chipper,
and is surprised that the party wants to talk to him.  &quot;What's up,
guys&quot;? he asks cheerfully.

The party is taken aback by this, as his whole demeanor has been fairly
gruff up until this point.  Has he been nipping at the dreamlilly again?
Is the Boromar clan using him as a mole to steal House Kundarak
secrets by turning him into a drug addict they control?  All these
questions pass through the heads of the party.

They take him into Kessen's office ask him about his allegiance to House
Kundarak, and about his drug use.  He is shocked that they would say
such a thing about him and denies any knowledge of that.  He even says
he will take a &quot;Zone of Truth&quot; test to prove it.  Not wanting to do that
yet, Kessen demurs and says he will wait to see what the night brings.
For now, he is placing Harkhun on temporary suspension for the night.
Harkhun doesn't seem too upset and gladly says he'll take the day off.
He smiles and walks chipperly out of the office.

The party then talks with Kessen.  They feel that this will be the night
something is attempted, and they decide to spend one last night in the
vault.  Accordingly, they leave to rest up and gather supplies for the
upcoming struggle.

Date:  13 Nymm, 998
Place:  Kundarak Vault #17, Tavick's Landing
Time:  11 PM

Once again the party takes up residence in their crate, waiting for the
night.  The door-guard is warned by Kessen not to open the door without
the password and leave the party to their fate.

Time passes slowly, until just before midnight, when the door slowly
swings open.  Kessen rushes into the vault and shouts &quot;Guys, you need to
come out here.  It's real important.&quot;

The party doesn't answer, watching Kessen through the air holes in their
crate.  Kessen looks around, shrugs, and leaves.

A few minutes later, there is a distant sound of thumping, and Kessen
returns, seeming more agitated.  &quot;Guys?&quot; he asks again.  Once more the
party does not respond.  Kessen skitters back out.

Only a minute later, Kessen reappears and says &quot;Guys, I--&quot;  He is
interrupted, however, by a strange three-armed boomerang which whistles
out of the doorway and strikes him squarely in the back of the head,
felling him.  He plops forward onto his face.

Agitated, the party opens the crate and rushes out.  Down the hallway,
they can see that the &quot;Prismatic Curtain&quot; is shut off and the door
opening into the outer office is wide open.  Standing in the doorway is
a glassy-eyed hobgoblin clutching a large scroll tube.  Instead of
armor, though, the hobgoblin is wearing a business suit.  He raises the
scroll tube over his head like a club and shuffles forward, shouting
&quot;Move to strike!  Move to strike!&quot;  Behind him, a group of like-dressed
and armed hobgoblins all move stiffly forward in lockstep.

Suddenly, there is an explosion from behind the hobgoblins, knocking
some of them over.  Through the opening in the group, the party sees a
rush of red, scaly flesh as hordes of kobolds rush into the crowded room
jabbering away in Draconic, something about &quot;revenge.&quot;

The party tightens their group on their weapons, and Bot says, &quot;Well,
this is interesting...&quot;

Next time:  the final battle, a thief is collared, and the epilogue
wherein the party is given a choice in their future.
