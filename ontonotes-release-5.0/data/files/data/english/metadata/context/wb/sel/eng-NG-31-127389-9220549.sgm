Well, the spam problem....

On my sci careers website there is an associated email address and it
finally got into the hands of the spamers. So, after months of not
checking it, today I look and tons of pure junk. Deleteo it all.
However, maintaining that website in the public interest is becoming
unjustifiable and I'm thinking of taking it down. So far, my other
&quot;secret&quot; email addresses have not yet been discovered by the spammers.
Here, I've got Spam Assassin turned on and it gets 95%+ and I've got it
configured to dump it all to /dev/null/ which means it permanently goes
poof without me ever seeing it. A plain, simple email will get to me,
however (some of you already know this). My ISP does have a
whitelist/blacklist option and you don't have to be on the whitelist to
get through, but on the blacklist, nobody gets through. It works pretty
good.

Makes me think of DK's view of &quot;superior&quot; western (white?) society (&quot;we
obliterated X, that's all that counts&quot;) and here I am thinking about all
the things that don't work in our modern unstable society, poison our
lives, polute the environment, dillute our brains, and all the new medicines
coming out that do more damage than good (the more I hear about, the more
its: i) medications getting more expensive, ii) side effects worse than
the disease, iii) people have to try a lot to find one that works (so for
the ones that don't work, half of that cost goes into the garbage can,
i.e. waste, and iv) for the people where none of the medicines work, all
of the money going into purchase is a 100% waste, and if you multiply
that by millions of people, there is only one beneficiary: the pharma
companies).  And, of course, our FDA has been defanged for some time now
by administrative caveat that favors big pharma. New med out? Maybe better
wait a few years to see if the phase III clinical trials involving mass
human guinea pigs is showing up deaths or adverse drug reactions before
you become a statistic.

Oh, yeah....do you know how you're going to pay for this stuff (if you
don't have pretty good benefits)? There are &quot;orphan&quot; drugs out there that
costs $100,000 to 300,000/year. And, for some people, you have to take
them for life.

Maybe one day they'll make pills which will let anyone &quot;selectively
forget&quot; any memory they want.  Then they'll start adding it to the
water supply.

They already have, but you've forgotten. :-)

Brave New World had _Soma_ tablets.

We have Prozac and tons of &quot;mood altering&quot; drugs. Thank the psychiatry
profession for adding another 50% more &quot;symptoms&quot; for which they, for
sure, can cure with a pill.

I think if you are shy (as in BFD), they have a name for that (some kind
of social anxiety syndrome) and, yes, a pill for that.

Tens of millions of kids are on Ritalin or one of another 1-2 dozen drugs
to &quot;dope up&quot; the kid (because the adult parents have &quot;instant
gratificationitis&quot; and can't be bothered by what are actually normal kid
rambunctiousness) into a stupor.

Not to mention all the other illicit drugs out there that some fraction of
all people can't live life without.

It is the downside of course, but it makes people busy. In the past
(and in some places now) they cut each other throats out of boredom.

When I was a kid, it was clorination and fluoridiation that was a
communist plot. Now, nobody even peeps about this. And, for all that gets
flushed into the drain, ends up running out of tertiary sewage treatment
and back into rivers, and wells...we're getting a constant mix of all
manner of low level hormones, drugs, residual antibiotics (beef &amp; cows for
weight gain) and nobody but nobody knows the long term effects of all
this, let alone who cares?

I wonder how much low level nuclear waste has been secretly dumped
into rivers and other freshwater bodies.

You can read the Rad Safety journals yourself and its not a secret at all.
Every dump-storage site has a long long history of leakages (through
rusting, deteriorating, defective cracks, accidents, mistakes, human
error, and perhaps accidentaly-on-purpose errors).

Maybe one day somebody will find a way to genetically modify human
beings to be immune to radioactivity.

Radioactivity is not a big concern.
Be more concerned with the chemicals from dumping and agriculture, and
concentration of heavy metals in fish and other animals people eat.

If there is not a lot of it and you don't get the radionuclides, which if
they are in the transuranic cycle are worse from a chemical toxicity
point of view than the radioactivity from those elements (so the book
said).

Don't forget all the anti-biotic resistant bugs coming out.

And, all kinds of weirdo other things from hormones, steroids, blah-blah,
that are out there, synergistically interacting with each other to make
trouble for all of us down the road.
