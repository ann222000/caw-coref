My neighbor had their lawn mowed and their leaves "raked" yesterday.
The landscaper used a leafblower as when I came out to my car it was
covered in a layer of dirt and dust.  I just had the car detailed and I
was very upset as I had come out to my car earlier to retrieve
something and they saw me.  I figured they could have at least given me
a warning to move my car which I would happily.  I hosed my car down
later on but there is still a layer of dust that is still adhering to
the surface it seems.

Should I leave them a note or even mention it?  I am not into making
waves as I hardly know them at all but still I do not think they have a
license to filthy my car just because their landscaper is too lazy to
rake the leaves up.  I think the landscaper used the leafblower to
"clean" off the curb and sidewalk which probably contributed to most of
the dirt on my car.  Real filthy stuff.

You don't have to be confrontational or "make waves," about the issue,
but just politely ask them to speak to their landscaper about the
situation (chances are they don't even know it happened or what the
landscaper is doing) or ask them to let you know when the landscaper is
going to be servicing the lawn so you can make arrangements for your
car.

Mark me down as a foe of leaf blowers. If you are just "blowing" the
leaves, where are you blowing them? Unto your neighbors lawn? Into the
street? Raleigh, NC has lots of tress, so this time of year the leaves
are a major nuisance. Before leaf blowers most people raked them into
piles in the street at the curb and the city picked them up. With leaf
blower they pretty much do the same thing, only it takes longer and
makes a lot more noise, and the piles tend to be cover more of the road
but are shallower. When I actually had a house with a yard and trees, I
used a different strategy. I mowed the lawn a couple of times a week
during "leaf" season. The grass didn't need it, but by mowing with the
mulching mower, I was able to break up the leaves and they mostly
disappeared into the grass. I  was returing nutriants to the soil, and
saving the city the expense of hauling my leaves to a compost pile. I
could mow the yard in a fraction the time it took to "blow it" with a
leaf blower, and my mower was far quieter than any leaf blower.

The Mexicans that clean parking lots in my area use the leaf blowers to
shift the dirt and trash from one side of the lot to the other, and
sometimes into the landscaping at the edges of the lot. I've never seen
them actually remove any debris, they just move it around while making
lots of noise.

I was just driving by and heard this argument in progress, so thought I
would propose a solution to the "blowing leaves into the neighbor's
perceived territory thereby starting a "turf war.""   We've lived in maybe
10 states and Germany and only when we lived in Virginia, with plenty of
grass and trees, did I discover a "mulching mower," which has several
cutting blades that turn grass and leaves into mulch.  One can either blow
it into a bag, or blow it back into the grass - which was what I did.  When
fall came I used no rake, or blower - just ran the lawnmower over the leaves
and they were gone.  Some people think that you can build up a "thatch' at
the base of the grass, but I never had a problem with Fescue grass.

I was just driving by and heard this argument in progress, so thought I
would propose a solution to the "blowing leaves into the neighbor's
perceived territory thereby starting a "turf war.""   We've lived in maybe
10 states and Germany and only when we lived in Virginia, with plenty of
grass and trees, did I discover a "mulching mower," which has several
cutting blades that turn grass and leaves into mulch.  One can either blow
it into a bag, or blow it back into the grass - which was what I did.  When
fall came I used no rake, or blower - just ran the lawnmower over the leaves
and they were gone.  Some people think that you can build up a "thatch' at
the base of the grass, but I never had a problem with Fescue grass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;better: get a blower that sucks them up and shreads them.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe the technical term for that is &quot;mulching lawn mower.&quot;

&gt; mower anyway, most people would just mulch the leaves with the mower
&gt; rather than buy a separate device to vacuum them up.

Which, if you paid attention, is what I said I do... but above mentioned
collection... and for collection, shread and vac does makes it easier
apparently.

&gt; Should I leave them a note or even mention it?  I am not into making
&gt; waves as I hardly know them at all but still I do not think they have a
&gt; license to filthy my car just because their landscaper is too lazy to
&gt; rake the leaves up.  I think the landscaper used the leafblower to
&gt; &quot;clean&quot; off the curb and sidewalk which probably contributed to most of
&gt; the dirt on my car.  Real filthy stuff.

You are kidding right????  If your car is so special that it can't be
exposed to the elements, then why wasn't it in the garage.  Good
grief!!

When you drive down the road and another car splashes mud who will you
complain to.  A light afternoon sprinkle will likely leave your car
spotted and watermarked.

&gt; &gt; on/around their vehicle/s.  Being unable to discern how that was my
&gt; &gt; problem all I could suggest is that they park elsewhere on Thursdays.

&gt; It's your problem because the leaves and grass come from your yard.
&gt; Duh.

I have delegated the responsibility to a licensed and bonded
contractor.  They can present their opposition to his technique with
him.  But ISTM it would be impossible to blow the leaves next to their
vehicle without some overspray.  They have driveways and garages of
their own and chose instead to park in front of my house.  Then they
chose to solve their own problem, as I suggested, and everything has
worked out fine.  I attened a little soiree at their home over the
weekend.

My cars are always parked in my driveway or garage.  Present your idea

We just move them to the curb. The boro sends it's truck that collects them
and puts them on the mulch pile with any resident can then use.

Because the illegal aliens are too damn lazy to use a rake.

&lt;just kidding, of course&gt;

Because they are more efficient than raking.  They blow the leaves into
a pile, which you then dispose of properly.
