Reposting something I wrote a few years back...

It's pretty clear that Macbeth must have
been written sometime before April 20,
1611 because that's the date when Simon
Forman saw it at the Globe. The question
many will be interested in, is how much
earlier could it have been written. As it
happens, a number of topical references
allow us to be quite sure that Macbeth
was composed sometime after 1605.

Point #1.

Back in 1997, CMC wrote a post reviewing
Garry Wills findings in his book _Witches &amp;
Jesuit: Shakespeare's Macbeth_. Dejanews no
longer goes back that far but fortunately,
CMC's post can still be seen at:

As CMC told us, Wills noted that at least
three other plays written not long after
the discovery of the plot contain
descriptions of attempted or completed
regicide, witches, a necromancy scene,
references to equivocation, and tests of
loyalty through deceptive language. None
of those themes appears to be a
commonplace. The combination is
therefore likely to be very significant.
In fact, if we knew nothing at all of
the author Shakespeare, the authorities
would still be using the fact that
Macbeth contains those same five
thematic elements related to the
Gunpowder Plot to date its composition
to around 1606-7.

There are a number of other interesting
topical references worth noting. (All of the
facts below may be found through reading
Henry Paul's _The Royal Play of Macbeth_.)

Point #2.

Shortly after the Gunpowder Plot was foiled,
a medal was struck to glorify the sagacity of
the king in detecting the plot. It shows a
serpent lurking among the flowers with the
inscription &quot;DETECTUS QUI LATUIT S.C.&quot; Lady
Macbeth told her husband to &quot;look like the
innocent flower, but be the serpent under
it.&quot;

Point #3.

In _The King's Book_, printed on Nov 5 1605,
some of the conspirators were said to have
been taken alive and sent to London because
people wanted to see them &quot;as the rarest sort
of monsters; fools to laugh at them; women
and children to wonder, all the common people
to gaze.&quot;

Macbeth V, xiii: &quot;Then yield thee coward And
live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole.&quot;

There are also some topical references
associated with King Christian of Denmark's
1606 visit to England.

Point #4.

In Holinshed's Macbeth, the Scots defeated
the Danes Shakespeare converted the losers to
Norweyans. This change seems most likely to
have been done to lessen the chance of
inadvertently offending King Christian.

Point #5.

As King James made his slow progress in the
spring of 1603 from Edinburgh to London, he
let it be known that Peace and Unity were his
cardinal political ideals.&quot; In his first
speech to Parliament he said, &quot;I bring you
two gifts, one peace with foreign nations,
the other union with Scotland.&quot;

In 1606, Nixon, in his _The Black Year_,
enlarged the phrase to include the word
&quot;love.&quot; (&quot;Many think well of themselves in
making the Doctrine of love, peace, and
unity, the occasion of strife, contention,
and heresie.&quot;)

On July 17, 1606, Marston wrote a Latin
speech which was designed to glorify &quot;Love,
Peace, and Unity,&quot; but the Latin word Marston
chose to substitute for &quot;Love&quot; was
&quot;Concordia.&quot; (MS of speech is still extant.)

Stowe's chronicle published in 1615 describes
the incident also using the word &quot;Concorde.&quot;

Macbeth IV,iii:

&quot;Nay, had I power, I should Poure the sweet
Milke of Concord, into Hell, Uprore the
universall peace, confound All unity on
earth.&quot;

It is not to be found in Holinshed.

Surely, James who in 1603 spoke only
positively of &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;union&quot; was not
borrowing from Shakespeare. Since he did not
use the word &quot;concord,&quot; it seems very
unlikely that Nixon borrowed from
Shakespeare. That means that either
Shakespeare borrowed the word &quot;concord&quot; from
Marston or Marston borrowed from
Shakespeare. Either way, it's a data point
telling us that Macbeth was composed sometime
after the early part of 1606.

The argument could be extended to include
a few more facts, but I'm running out of
time, so I'll end it here. In any event,
several of the points I've noted, appear
to be pretty strong, even if taken just by
themselves. Taken together, there is very
little room left for doubt. Macbeth *was*
written sometime after the end of 1605.

I understand that Oxfordians will not
find that conclusion the least bit
desirable. Oh well.

I'm just treporting what Boyce said. But if he's right, and there's
something in The Puritan, which I haven't read, that indicates its
author was familiar with Macbeth, it would be a crucial fact for the
dating of the play. On the other hand, I doubt that there's anything
in The Puritan that certainly indicates its author knew of
Shakespeare's play. Those kinds of things can always be contested.

The 'logic' here escapes me altogether.
(a) Some other plays (claimed to have been
written around 1606-7) are like Macbeth.
(b) Err . . . . that's it
Ergo: Macbeth was written after the
Gunpowder plot.

How desperate can you get? The world
changed with the accession of James
and the Gunpowder plot. It was like 9/11.
Does anyone here have a problem
detecting whether or not films (cinema
or TV) were written before or after 9/11?
Why should we have next-to-impossible
problems in making the same distinction
as regards Macbeth and other canonical
plays?

How could a commercial playwright
writing in 1606/7 NOT make it clear that
James was on the throne and that the
Gunpowder plot had occurred?

Why did he feel obliged to put in ONLY
the most subtle of hints -- ones that
require the highest levels of 'scholarship',
and decades or centuries of research, to
detect?

This exercise is typical of the pointless,
mindless level to which Stratfordianism
descends.

This is SO BAD that it's hard to believe that
any Strat would want to seriously present it
as evidence of the dating of Macbeth. Any
remotely intelligent reader will, at this point,
realise that if Strats think that THIS counts as
evidence, then they have no case at all.

For hundreds of years, scholars with an
intimate knowledge of Macbeth have trawled
the hundreds of thousands of early Jacobean
records and artefacts, and THIS is the best
'parallel' that they could come up with.
The poet is supposed to have lacked in
inspiration to such a degree, that he relied
on medals to provide him with images. So
if that medal had never been struck, or if
the poet had not seen that image, then he'd
have worded the passage differently!

Does any Strat allege that the poet draws
a parallel between Macbeth and the
Gunpowder plotters? No. Are serpents
and flowers very common in Shakespeare?
Yes. Could it have been a coincidence?
&quot;No way&quot; -- according to our Strats.
Or might it have been possible that the
designers of the medal got the 'idea' from
Macbeth?

Denmark was a Protestant country and a

other connection is there between the speech
in Macbeth and the political situation in
England after 1604? -- Why, none. None
whatsoever.

The logic is quite false. Marston could
well have seen manuscript copies of
Macbeth before 1606, and he was weak
enough a writer to feel the need to lift
phrases from another. (Not that the
words here are so unusual -- or form so
unusual a combination -- as to require
this theory.)

Marston's play-writing career is quite
strange. He gave it up in 1609, becoming
a clergyman in Hampshire until his death
in 1634. Some of his plays contain
material of remarkable quality, far above
his usual level. IMO he was one of
those who, somehow or other, obtained
some of Oxford's material, on or before
Oxford's death.

Typical of Paul's determination to have it both ways.
If the evidence of James's accession and of the Gunpowder Plot is not
mentioned in certain plays, that ipso facto Paulo proves the plays were
written long before.
If one cites only some of the evidence that Macbeth was written after
James's accession and, indeed, after the Gunpowder Plot and its subsequent
trials, then it is insufficiently extreme. Clearly plays written after the
GP ought to be submitted to Paul first before being published.

The details I always note are Macbeth's vision of the Stewart kings,
concluding in James VI and I with his multiple orbs and crowns and a mirror
showing his endless successors. High treason even to imagine such a thing
out loud before Elizabeth's death. Especially at the court of so jealous a
sovereign as Elizabeth: to write encomia to her successor (who had never
been officially designated) would have been treason. It never happened.

Too, the Porter's scene, with its direct and specific reference to the
Jesuit testimony in the GP trials, cannot have been written before they took
place. Which is to say, after Oxford's death.

Sort of like saying the appearance of Polonius is evidence that the author

I found this curious because Christian was king of Norway as well. (It was
in Norway that James married Anne.) And of course, Sven, invader of
Scotland, though the son of Cnut of England and Denmark, was in fact King of
Norway himself.

However, if this WAS a change from Holinshed (whom I have not read on this
point), then there was no point at all in making it during Elizabeth's
reign. She was not allied with Denmark, and Christian never visited her.

Well there's at least as much as there is of an Oxfordian connection to any
of the plays, however the play can NOT have been written before James's
accession, and the Porter scene can NOT have been written before the
Gunpowder Plot. Since there were no Jesuits in Macbeth's era (and no
reformation for the matter of that), there would be no particular point in
stressing the matter.

But the play was written in large part to glorify James's descent from (the
fictitious) Banquo and the (possibly not fictitious) Fleance, as well as his
succeeding to the holy crown of Saint Edward. As no one believes it was
remotely the last of Shakespeare's plays, this argues that it sets much of
the canon well after Oxford's death. Which accords with such other
circumstantial evidence as the publication and performance dates.

The play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, like at least half of the Shakespeare cannon
appeared in print for the first time in 1623.

It includes entire scenes that many scholars agree were likely penned
by Thomas Middleton - including stage directions that the witches
should sing &quot;Come, Away, Come Away&quot; and &quot;Black Spirits&quot; - songs that
appeared in Middleton's play, &quot;The Witch&quot; (1613).

The problem with attributing a date of composition to &quot;Macbeth&quot; is the
fact that it is a work that is full of obvious deletions and
interpolations. Who knows what was added or deleted from the time of
its creation to its eventual inclusion in the First Folio?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Point #4.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In Holinshed's Macbeth, the Scots defeated

&gt;&gt;&gt; have been done to lessen the chance of
&gt;&gt;&gt; inadvertently offending King Christian.

&gt;&gt; Denmark was a Protestant country and a
&gt;&gt; long-standing ally of England. James
&gt;&gt; married Anne of Denmark in 1589, so
&gt;&gt; reasons for not offending the wife of the
&gt;&gt; (unnamed) successor had long been in
&gt;&gt; place.

&gt; I found this curious because Christian was king of Norway as well. (It was
&gt; in Norway that James married Anne.) And of course, Sven, invader of
&gt; Scotland, though the son of Cnut of England and Denmark, was in fact King of
&gt; Norway himself.

&gt; However, if this WAS a change from Holinshed (whom I have not read on this

&gt; Facts?

&gt; Is THIS the sort of thing that Stratfordians
&gt; must rely upon to prove their man is the
&gt; poet?

"/>

Why do Stratfordians have to &quot;prove their man is the poet&quot;? The traditional
attribution is the default position, established by centuries of common
consent and buttressed by masses of evidence. Many individual pieces of that
evidence are slight, but they are mutually supportive and self-consistent.
Where biographers venture on modest speculation, as for WS's schooling, they
are suggesting no more than can be established by reasonable interpretation
of what is known - in that case, of the family's status and the nature of
the local school.

Those who support some other claimant to the authorship need to do two
things. First, to dislodge the claims of WS of Stratford. This means
ignoring evidence such as the monument and the local traditions concerning
it, and the material prefatory to the First Folio, thereby making liars and
frauds of WS's fellow dramatist Ben Jonson (in whose plays he himself said
WS was an actor and who made the first informed comment on his colleague's
work) and of Hemimge and Condell, WS's associates in the same theatre
company. Needless to say, there is not the slightest reason to doubt the
honesty of any of them.

Then they must postulate a conspiracy of silence on a vast and unexampled
scale, never betrayed by the many who must have worked with WS as actor and
in management, and capable of fooling the hundreds or thousands who bought
the quartos (and later the folios and the sonnets) bearing his name.

And which of the miscellaneous claimants are we to take seriously? Surely
not Bacon, &quot;Renaissance genius&quot; though he may have been, who nowhere shows
any smidgeon of poetic or theatrical skill commensurate with the author of
&quot;Macbeth&quot; or &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. Nor Oxford, to justify whose
authorship the plays need to be given implausible dates and who in his known
writings shows none of WS's complexity of imagery and range of insight.
Marlowe? Yes - if he had lived on as Peter Farey has shown might be a
possibility, though even then we have again to accept a most implausible
conspiracy, confirmed by an all-too-ingenious interpretation of slight
oddities in the monument and gravestone inscriptions.

But why bother? The accepted attribution is well enough supported.
Essentially the case against the man of Stratford is &quot;But he wasn't
clever-sophisticated-learned-courtly enough&quot;. We simply don't know enough of
his acquaintances and his reading to form such a judgment.

--------------------

It's some years since I came across this newsgroup, and I've tried hard to
follow the anti-Stratfordian case or cases, even Paul Crowley's bizarre
interpretations of the Sonnets. I remain unconvinced. The same old material
revolves, with little or no new evidence to discuss. All one can do is point
out the occasional minor error of fact and inanity of argument, which seems
hardly worth the effort of drafting and typing.

So, with best wishes to all, I will say goodbye.

Unfortunately, since all of Shakespeare's original films are lost, we
have neither the color response of the film stock nor the women's
eyebrow shapes to judge from.

Go check out the very puzzled people at Fox's &quot;24&quot; discussion board, who
are flummoxed by the statement that there has been a three-year gap
between last season and this. &quot;Does that mean,&quot; the poor dears say,
&quot;that this season takes place in the future, or did the first two
seasons take place in the past?&quot;

(A good thing they don't have to deal with the 19-year gap between the
last two episodes of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, or the 2-year gap that occurs in the
middle of one of the episodes of the second series of &quot;The Fall and Rise

Who cares about 'popular discussions'? The

The doctrine of 'equivocation' had been discussed

Elizabeth was thinking of marrying Christian, was she? He was, what, fifty

What evidence can you cite that Elizabeth's England ever took Denmark

It is ignored.
The marriage partner she considered was the King of Sweden.
She never, ever, considered a Dane.

One of her closest friends was a Norwegian noblewoman who came to England on
an embassy and married Catherine Parr's brother, Northampton. Yet the
presence of one of King Christian's subjects so close to Elizabeth's
councils seems never to have raised the question of a close relationship
with her sovereign.

Yes, but NO ONE IN ENGLAND was interested in Scottish ANTIQUITIES (aside
from Holinshed, whose scope was all Britain) and a play on the subject would
have been of no interest to anyone -- before James's accession.

Cite an instance other than Macbeth, a play we know was not written till
after Elizabeth's death. A poem or play on ancient Scottish themes would do.
A painting of Bannockburn, perhaps. A church dedicated to St. Margaret
maybe. Anything at all? No? Why, how can that be? Because the English
weren't interested in the Scots and their history -- until James succeeded.

Not in the least. The idea that the play could possibly have been written --
as a remotely stageable or paying proposition -- before James's accession is
an idea that could only come to blindsided masters of doublethink who refuse
to accept evidence that Oxford was dead when Shakespeare's plays were still
being written -- by Shakespeare.

No point in trying to have a rational argument with someone whose idea of

&gt;I'm aware of those, but that's one minor scene. I'd like to know what
&gt;&quot;entire scenes&quot; he's talking about. For some strange reason I can't put my
&gt;finger on, I suspect he's exaggerating.

"/>

In Act 3 scene 5, Hecate and others speak about 30 lines in the text
of Macbeth, whereas the musical scene 'Come away' is 42 lines in
Middleton's the Witch, and presumably took much longer per line to
perform than the spoken lines. The total length of Middleton's Act 3
scene 3 is about 80 lines. The impression is quite strongly that the
spoken part of Macbeth Act 3 scene 5 was written simply to accommodate
the musical scene, because Middleton's spoken words did not fit the
Macbeth situation.

By 'musical scene' I mean that there are several participants who
converse and respond to one another in song. On the CD, &quot;Shakespeare's
Lutenist&quot;, this one is timed at 3 minutes 4 seconds.

The appearance of Hecate in Act 4 scene 1 begins with two lines not in
Middleton, but everything from there to her exit is Middleton's Act 5
scene 2 lines 60-76 (another musical scene). In Macbeth only the first
two lines of Middleton are reprinted. Some of the others seem
inappropriate to Macbeth - Middleton's witches are mixing a poison:
- The juice of toad, the oil of adder,
- Those will make the younker madder!
But no doubt it would all pass, on stage with music.
This is not a whole scene in Shakespeare terms, but it is a big
episode in a scene.

Not so clear to me. The Porter serves as more than just a vehicle for
some topical references. The scene allows the audience to catch its
collective breath after the murder of Duncan, and because the tension
is lowered during the scene, it makes the discovery of the murder more
exciting. It also lets Macbeth wash the blood from his hands before he
comes back on. It hardly seems a scene tacked on for a contemporary
reference.

I have to stand with Paul on this (I guess we had to agree on something). I
don't see anything &quot;clearly added.&quot; The macabre insertion of humor to

Not necessarily exaggerating but rather reporting on research in the
matter.

According to F.P. Wilson, the following are scenes that have liekley
been cut from the text:

Scene between Macbeth and his wife between I. iii and I. iv

Later scene in which Lady Macbeth went with knife in hand to murder
Duncan and another dialogue between Lady Macbeth and her husband.

A scene in which Banquo made his position clear on the accession of
Macbeth and showing that he was not acquiescing in Macbeth's crimes.

A scene that would solve the mystery of the appearance of the third
murderer.

A scene which would adequately explain Macduff's desertion of his
wife.

Scenes early in the play that would develop Macduff as a worthy
adversary for Macbeth.

The above needs to be put into a larger context.

The play &quot;Macbeth&quot; according to a number of eminent scholars was
heavily edited before it appeared in print. It is the shortest of the
tragedies and one of the shortest in the canon.

According to Dr. Greg, &quot;there is clear evidence of cutting at some
points in short abrupt lines accompanied by textual obscurities, and
there are also some difficulties of construction.&quot;

Henry Cunningham, the first editor of the Arden Macbeth, stated that:
&quot;It is admitted by all competent scholars that the text of Macbeth has
been more or less vitiated by the interpolation or addition of some
dramatist other than Shakespeare.&quot;

Spend some time with the introductory material of any Arden, Oxford or
New Variorum edition of the text and you will read similar views
expressed about the &quot;authorial&quot; nature of the text as a whole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, like at least half of the Shakespeare cannon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appeared in print for the first time in 1623.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It includes entire scenes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which &quot;entire scenes,&quot; exactly?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's referring to Hekate's couplets in the Witches' scene, which are
&gt; taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; verbatim from Middleton's The Witches and are certainly by him and not
&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WS.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jean Coeur de Lapin

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm aware of those, but that's one minor scene. I'd like to know what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;entire scenes&quot; he's talking about. For some strange reason I can't put
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;finger on, I suspect he's exaggerating.

&gt;&gt; In Act 3 scene 5, Hecate and others speak about 30 lines in the text
&gt;&gt; of Macbeth, whereas the musical scene 'Come away' is 42 lines in
&gt;&gt; Middleton's the Witch, and presumably took much longer per line to
&gt;&gt; perform than the spoken lines. The total length of Middleton's Act 3
&gt;&gt; scene 3 is about 80 lines. The impression is quite strongly that the
&gt;&gt; spoken part of Macbeth Act 3 scene 5 was written simply to accommodate
&gt;&gt; the musical scene, because Middleton's spoken words did not fit the
&gt;&gt; Macbeth situation.

&gt;&gt; By 'musical scene' I mean that there are several participants who
&gt;&gt; converse and respond to one another in song. On the CD, &quot;Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; Lutenist&quot;, this one is timed at 3 minutes 4 seconds.

&gt;&gt; The appearance of Hecate in Act 4 scene 1 begins with two lines not in
&gt;&gt; Middleton, but everything from there to her exit is Middleton's Act 5
&gt;&gt; scene 2 lines 60-76 (another musical scene). In Macbeth only the first
&gt;&gt; two lines of Middleton are reprinted. Some of the others seem
&gt;&gt; inappropriate to Macbeth - Middleton's witches are mixing a poison:
&gt;&gt; - The juice of toad, the oil of adder,
&gt;&gt; - Those will make the younker madder!
&gt;&gt; But no doubt it would all pass, on stage with music.
&gt;&gt; This is not a whole scene in Shakespeare terms, but it is a big
&gt;&gt; episode in a scene.

I totally agree with Willldever. And we are in good company.

According to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Clarendon, the first 21 lines
of the Porter Scene Lines were likely interpolated by the actors and
included in the first folio. To them, (and I agree) those lines are
not Shakespeare.

&gt; ... The Porter serves as more than just a vehicle for
&gt; some topical references. The scene allows the audience to catch its
&gt; collective breath after the murder of Duncan, and because the tension
&gt; is lowered during the scene, it makes the discovery of the murder more
&gt; exciting. It also lets Macbeth wash the blood from his hands before he
&gt; comes back on. It hardly seems a scene tacked on for a contemporary
&gt; reference.

"/>

The Porter scene is an obvious topical insertion. Notice how the
Porter's remarks are written. There's no attempt at rhyme, or even
division into lines, it's flat-out prose. Compare it with the
passages before and after, and it's very different. The only other
straight prose in the play is when Lady Macbeth reads the letter.
Also, the Porter's remarks are completely unrelated to events in the
play. A Shake-speare servant/Clown who has nothing to say about the
events of the play?? Nah.

The great dramatist decided to relieve the audience tension by
throwing in a few knock-knock jokes, and mentioning how drink makes
people piss. If you say so.

The Porter probably replaced a conversation between Macduff and Lennox
about why their knocking went unanswered and whether something might
be wrong.

&quot;Meanwhile, James had been turning his thoughts towards matrimony.
Fowler ascribed this to the pressure of his councillors, and believed
that James was indifferent to women. He wrote to Walsingham to that
effect in December 1588: '[The King] never regards the company of any
woman, not so much as in any dalliance.&quot;' But James had a romantic
streak in him which presently revealed itself. Two ladies were under
consideration - Ann, the daughter of the King of Denmark, and
Catherine de Bourbon, the sister of Henry, King of Navarre. The
Scottish townsmen, both for religious and for commercial reasons,
favoured Denmark. Ann had the advantage of age; she was not quite
fifteen, eight years younger than the King. Catherine was thirty-one,
eight years older.
Elizabeth favoured the French match. So did Burghley and Walsingham,
probably because they wanted to strengthen Navarre's position in
France and to destroy the old ties between the Scottish Crown and the
Guises.&quot; But they do not seem to have regarded it as a matter of vital
importance. Elizabeth herself declined an invitation from James to advise
him on the subject, pleading that since she had forborne marriage herself
she was not qualified to advise in matters matrimonial.&quot; Lord Wemys, the
Scottish envoy in England, to whom she made this observation, got back
to Edinburgh in May saturated apparently with English opposition to the
Danish match. There was some talk of sending Sir George Cary to urge
the English view, or Burghley's son, Sir Robert Cecil. But Elizabeth
decided instead to use the services of the Master of Gray, in banishment
at the time but expecting momentarily to be restored to James's favour.
Burghley favoured Gray and considered him a 'very sufficient gentleman'.
He returned to Scotland at the end of May and later in the year resumed
his seat on the Privy Council. &quot; (Conyers Read, &quot;Burghley&quot;, pp 453/4)

Hamlet, Richard II and Edward II and other

one reasonable explanation for all such plays:
They were mainly written for a private court
audiences, and were not performed in public

Yes -- the notion that anyone other than William Shakespeare wrote the

This play could only have been written when a Scottish monarch claiming
descent from Banquo and from Duncan united many crowns and defied witches
and touched for the King's Evil in the tradition of Edward the Confessor.
None of these things were true before James succeeded. The play was written
to honor him, and for his court.

Until a day or three ago, it was beyond my belief that anyone could
seriously look at the matter and believe otherwise. I forgot I was dealing
with anti-Strats for whom faith is mightier than evidence or logic.

On the contrary, it is plentiful. Only eight public

That's a circular argument. The reason so
much was 'high-flown' was that the 'buying
public' came from the top reaches of a highly
stratified society. Books were expensive.

The name began to appear on printed texts

Did Shaw spend much time doing that?
Even IF he did, how much direct contact
would a playwright necessarily need
with actors?

As I see it, Oxford certainly spent a lot of
time with actors, directing plays, when he
was young. (Remember his father -- like
his grandfather -- had his own body of
actors to keep the household entertained
during the winter months.) However, I
doubt if he did much with actors after
~1580. As soon as the need for obscurity
about his authorship was recognised (IMO
around 1565) he would have been careful
in their company, and worked through
intermediaries as much as possible.

&gt; to one or two mysterious aristocratic contributions to the stage. But the
&gt; most popular playwright in London, the author of more preserved works than
&gt; anyone else, a man who got rich by the theatre and bought himself rank with
&gt; it?

&gt;&gt; In any event, the 'minders' were fully in control,

What is the problem? If you want to keep
X's identity secret among your employees,
then when you hear some speculating about
who X might be, you cease to involve them
in that activity. All I'm saying is that they
controlled the situation. They were probably
surprised (if not mystified) at the absence of
talk about who this 'Mr Shakespeare' might be.
If they had heard some, they'd have taken
evasive steps.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
&gt;&gt;&gt; She would at the very least have sent the producers to the Tower.

&gt;&gt; She was not stupid. All manner of things
&gt;&gt; were discussed in private (and had to be
&gt;&gt; discussed) that were forbidden topics for
&gt;&gt; public debate. While I'm sure that there
&gt;&gt; no 'show of eight kings' the rest would have
&gt;&gt; been acceptable to her.

&gt; No. It would have struck far too close to the forbidden subject.

"/>

Much that was strictly forbidden to commoners
was, in fact, discussed intensively at court,
among the privy councillors. That had been
necessarily the case throughout her reign.

&gt; Scottish history was of NO interest before James came south.

How can you say such a stupid thing?
It was of little interest to commoners.
It was of necessarily of intense interest
to courtiers as soon as they realised
where their next monarch was coming from.

&gt;&gt; The portrayal of _any_ ruler on stage
&gt;&gt; leaves open an analogy to the current one
&gt;&gt; of the country where the play is staged.
&gt;&gt; That is why the rule that 'no rulers can be
&gt;&gt; shown on stage' is (or was) common.

&gt; Ah. That explains why so few kings or other rulers
&gt; appear in Shakespeare's plays.
&gt; I had always wondered.

I was talking about the generality of world
theatre. You need to realise the exceptional
nature of English theatre. When you do,
then perhaps you might begin to have some
thoughts on WHY it is so exceptional.

&gt; But it didn't. Everyone regards it as a typical courtly reference to her,

Yes, because she knew exactly who wrote
it, and she trusted his loyalty absolutely
-- and his words to some extent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; just as references to James's ancestors were typical courtly flattery
&gt; directed SOLELY at his ear.

"/>

You have to explain HOW James came to
trust the author and his words. Assuming
that he (or his advisers) read every word --
in as harmless a fashion as you do -- is not
an adequate theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It is not I who would have been reading
&gt;&gt; (or not reading) the play when it came out.

&gt; But those who were do not behave at all like rational
&gt; human beings in your scenarios.

Hitler beheaded those who made jokes
about him. That behaviour is quite
typical of other dictators and fully rational.
It does not need explanation. That of
Elizabeth and James does.

Stratfordians are so dumb that they are
quite unaware of all this. So, what else
is new?

&gt;&gt; Oh that's a stupid argument, Paul, QUITE unworthy of you.
&gt;&gt; Joan of Arc doesn't lead to much gossip about Shaw
&gt;&gt; because Shaw isn't there in the theater making changes
&gt;&gt; and listening to variant line readings.

&gt; Did Shaw spend much time doing that? Even IF he did, how much direct
&gt; contact would a playwright necessarily need with actors?

"/>

You should read Shaw on the actors with whom he had &quot;direct contact,&quot; such
as Beerbohm Tree and Mrs. Campbell. For Tree, according to Shaw, &quot;the
author, whether Shakespeare or Shaw, was a lame dog to be helped over the
stile by the ingenuity and inventiveness of the actor-producer. How to
add and subtract, to interpolate and prune, until an effective result was
arrived at, was the problem of production as he saw it.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; As I see it, Oxford certainly spent a lot of time with actors, directing
&gt; plays, when he was young.

"/>

There is no more reason to believe that Oxford directed plays than there
is to believe that the Lord Chamberlain and King James directed
Shakespeare's plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Remember his father -- like his grandfather -- had his own body of
&gt; actors to keep the household entertained during the winter months.)

"/>

And, of course, you see Oxford as one in a long line of theatrical
directors -- a very pretty vision, but not one for which there is the
least evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, I doubt if he did much with actors after ~1580. As soon as the
&gt; need for obscurity about his authorship was recognised (IMO around 1565)
&gt; he would have been careful in their company, and worked through
&gt; intermediaries as much as possible.

"/>

Instead of Oxford as &quot;Prince Tudor,&quot; you view him as Harold Prince, at
least until he turned 15. Again, this is a pretty vision, but one that is
entirely unjustified. I'm going to see what our own Harold Prince is up
to today, as I will be driving into Washington to see the new Sondheim
show *Bounce*.
