*CUCUMBER (Kheera/Kakdi)*

It is a creeping plant of the cucurbitaceae family probably originating in
India and widely cutivated for its fruit. It is a tender annual with a
rough, succulent trailing stem and hairy leaves with 3 to 5 pointed lobes;
the stem bears branched tendrils, by which the plant creeps through the
supports.

The food value of cucumber is low; but it is popular for salads and
relishes. Fresh cucumber should be firm, well-shaped and bright green in
colour. They may be kept in refrigerated storage for about 2 weeks.

It is a very favourite fruit during hot summer months as it keeps the body
cool and calm. It subsides pitta (bile) and aids digestion. It prevents
sun-stroke, heat-stroke and allergy. It quenches thirst.
