Fast way to lose friends I would suggest, how long do you have to
remain an A&amp;L victim/customer to avoid clawbacks?

Your point that you "will personally follow it through with customer
services untill BOTH PAYMENTS..." would suggest that you are aware that
A&amp;L have truly appalling customer service.

All UK based call centres its worth noting.

Personally would not reccomend that you trust Alliance and Leicester to
tell you the correct time of day never mind offer a secure home for
your hard earned money.

I have been with them for 16 years and *never* had any problems whatsoever.
The fact the call centres are UK based is a bouns, not having to say
everything 3 times to someone in Mumbai or wherever.

Was with them for over 10 years, whilst their branch counter staff are
without exception excellent, their call centre operations are in a
league of their own.

When my debit card is compromised do not expect the operator to refuse
to cancel it and tell me whilst giggling that no one will be listening
to the call because it isnt recorded.

Second operator does actually cancel the card but it took 2 calls and
more than 40 mins to secure a compromised card.

Concern always mounts when a senior customer service manager phones
from a mobile phone to avoid their call being recorded and asks that I
not submit complaints in writing.

I wish never again to have to meet a Bank branch manager who seals an
envlope in front of me and hands it to her area manager to be hand
delivered to the Managing Director because there is serious concern
about the security of their internal mail system.

Would suggest that it is a poor value £50 they are offering.

In contrast have never had an Indian call centre operator be anything
but courteous and keen to help.
