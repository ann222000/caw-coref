I will debate two competing world views (and by world I mean
everything that exists in this physical world).  This diatribe is not
meant to address theories that constitute some other form of existence
other then the physical one.

My initial point of argument is that something has to be eternal (had
no beginning).  Either our world is eternal or the thing/process that
created it is.  This would be in contrast to the idea that our world
suddenly started with no outside stimuli.  I discount this point of
view because there is no evidence to support it and it is
scientifically impossible (in any test environment we cannot create
something from nothing).

So given this as a starting point, I will discuss the first option -
that our world is eternal.

My theory that I will attempt to prove is that if our world is eternal
than our existence has no meaning - I know I'm a bright and cheery
guy.

-       If our world is eternal then any event that can happen has already
happened.  By this I mean that any event that is possible can be
described by some probability.  This probability would state that
given some finite time span a certain event will occur.  This means
that given an infinite time span that event will have occurred an
infinite number of times -because infinity would contain an infinite
number of time spans (no matter what length) each of which would
contain the event at least once.

-       Any event that we see occur would be described as possible and as
such must already have occurred an infinite amount of times.

-       Since any event that occurs must have already occurred in the past
that means this event does not preclude it from happening in the
future.  If we weigh the &quot;value&quot; of an event we can place that event
into one of three categories.  Either that event would encourage
further duplication of that event - I will label this category
&quot;good&quot;.  Or the event discourages further duplication of that event -
I will label this category &quot;evil&quot;.  Or this event has no overall
effect on the duplication of that event in a future context - I will
label this category &quot;neutral&quot;.  If an event is good in even the
slightest manner, then that event would encourage the event to occur
again.  Given even the slightest amount of nudging multiplied by an
infinite number of occurrences would yield an event that always occurs
continuously to the exclusion of all else.  The same thing would apply
for an evil event.  Even the slightest amount of discouragement
multiplied by an infinite number of occurrences would mean that the
event could never happen.  However, from our perspective we definitely
see events that look good or evil.  So that means that each event that
is good must be balance out by some other event (or set of events)
that is evil so as to dampen the overall good effect to be zero.  The
same would have to be true for evil events.  This means that every
event - given its overall context - must be neutral.

-       If every event that occurs is neutral, then nothing has any meaning
because nothing I do or say can ultimately change the outcome of
things.  Also everything I do and say must have already occurred an
infinite amount of times and in all of its previous occurrences these
events did not have any significance.

-       From this same argument you can state that the world will never have
an ending because an event that could lead to an ending must have
already occurred and would have already ended the world - but this is
really not part of my argument.

So this leaves the other point of view that the world did have a
beginning.  If it did have a beginning, then the world must have had
something to begin it (see my previous statement).  This something
either began with intent or began with no intent.

If the world began with no intent then that beginning was just an
event which would lead back to the argument that the world (in all of
its stages is eternal).

If the world began with intent then it requires a sentient source for
that beginning - most folk would call this God (or gods).

So I cannot prove God's existence with this argument, but I think I
can prove that my life is pointless without Him.

I think your argument is pointless and is full of inconsistencies and
unneccesary axioms for which you have no ground.
1) Though the universe may always have existed there is nothing to say
that every thing that could have happend already has. The universe
might ahve stayed unchanged since the beginning of time until it its
expansion and contraction.
2) It might ahve been expanding and contracting forever, but each
cycle is finite in time and so give limit and measure to the universe.
3) Any eternal universe would also nee to be of infinite size in order
for everything to have happened already. We know this to be false
empirically because we can measure the limits of the growing universe.
4) None of this invovles god or gods outside the mind of man.
5) Your notion that the universe had a beginning involves an agent to
start the universe is false. If there existed an agent the start the
universe going then the universe had already begun becasue the egent
had to have existed already.
Or for the simple minded: who created god?

Your life IS pointless. Get over it!
If you wish to assign a purpose to your life you are &quot;free&quot; to do so
within the boundaries set by that which determines you.Good Luck!

Don't listen to the naysayers MichaelND...especially idiots like chazwin
[uh..no offense...just a spade is a spade etc].  I find it amazing that you
are barking up a very similar tree I have been mulling over for some time
now.  As I read, it was like peering into my own head, only you articulate
it much better...making something rather obfuse, clear.

How about the scenario of having both an 'eternal moment' AND a 'beginning'?
This is a conundrum for me.  But I relate BEing...conscious entity to all
that you have said and go from there.  Conscious entity is a starting point
for me, not an end point...albiet, in an infinite setup, there can be no
ends or beginnings can there. Conscious Entity, for me anyway-as I see it,
MUST exist for any of it to have any impetus to exist at all.

Conscious Entity would look to perfect itself, much as you explain in a kind
of 'self correcting' good and evil evolution over infinite times of
exploration [of experience and BEing].

From the standpoint of BEing [disregarding a physical universe for a
moment], I see a 'wall' of constraint in an infinite setup, where 'boredom'
would be a major obstacle to overcome.  This could lead to even more dire
experience, such as empty jadedness and the true foundations of traditional
evil as painted through history.  Death then, could be the evolutionary
solution to this.  Also, how would you intertwine the possibility of many
BEings...many worlds to explore [so to speak]?  I'm not articulating this
well as you have mastered the idea.  One can sound the flake quite easily,
ha...but please continue on, expand on your ideas here.  I followed them
pretty well and I'm a dunce...so  you are doing well in explaining a
possibility that others might find most enlightening [if they open their
minds to the abstract realizations of self, being, and creation etc].

Too many overlook that in 'infinite time', all that will ever exist must
have already existed.
But to see this, one must expand beyond the limitations of
'universe'...ergo, why I look to consciousness itself as the deciding factor
in creation. But those that demand to stay to 'finite time'...must be
willing to accept that it all 'sprang from nothing', as you mention...a
quite insane notion by anything we can understand.

If the world (I am not limiting the scope to simply the universe we

it would have required some impetus to make this change.  Either this

I don't understand the logic behind this.  If every event that could
occur has occurred, it does not mean that each of these event have
occurred simultaneously (although I'm not sure how I could disprove
this).  Lets say our world was limited to a 100 event world where the
events where grouped into five sets of mutually exclusive events.
This does not mean that this world would require five unique
&quot;playgrounds&quot; for those events to occur.  However, it would imply some
sort of cyclical change whereby the world adapted from putting out one
groups of events followed by some change and then putting out a
different set of events.  I.E.  Not all events may be possible in any
one given instantiation of the world, but the different instantiations
of the world would need to be cyclical so that they do not prevent
themselves.  (this makes sense in my head, but I may not have
explained it well)

My initial premise was that something needs to be eternal.  I don't
know of any way to explain reality without including an idea of
eternality.  But that does not mean our world is eternal.  For this
argument, I considered the &quot;intent&quot; source to be outside of the
world.  (i.e. the creator is not usually considered to be part of its
creation).

Joseph Campbell &amp; Marija Gimbutas reconstructed the original Aryan
cosmology from clues in Proto-Indo-European and snippets of myth
retained in obscure rural villages. Chaos was 1st. But as we now know,
you cannot iterate random numbers forever without a self replicating
sequence, in this case Gaia, showing up.

And of course, iteration does not go on forever without random errors
producing what we now call 'evolution'. So, Gaia *evolved* to achieve
sentience. At this point She differentiated Herself from Chaos,
creating physical reality, &quot;Maya&quot;. Some of the earliest, Chalcolithic
iconography, shows Gaia, Maya, &amp; Chaos dancing. The *original*
Trinity.

The dance still goes on. Whether it began 15 billion years ago, or
merely this morning, presenting the pattern of energy seen in the sky
that merely looks like its been there 15 billion years does not really
matter.

Nor is the range of possible patterns limited to those which you think
are 'reality'. If you want a universe created by a Father god who
blesses or damns his children, no problem. It'll be there in the
morning. I am not ready to say which exist, or cannot exist, and am
content to consider what is shown to exist as a piece of art worthy of
appreciation.

Cute mythology, but I was trying to limit my statements to a logical
argument and not my view points (beliefs) about the origin of the
world.

The only &quot;patterns&quot;/events that I can consider in a logical argument
are those that are provable or are derived from provable (or somewhat
provable) statements.  So you may say that other patterns exist (and
per this argument I cannot say you are wrong), but how do I introduce
them into the theory without losing the premise that the argument is a
sound logical construct.

Note:  I am not saying my &quot;argument&quot; is a sound logical construct, but
that is what I was aiming towards.

And that &quot;thing&quot; is obviously not your argument, you're weird.

If your entire argument requires &quot;an initial point&quot;, so as to come
into existence and be sensed by man, then by what reasoning do you
deny there also had to have been an &quot;initial point&quot; - &quot;a beginning&quot; of
the universe, so as to come into existence and be sensed by man?

With this diatribe of yours, are you trying to place your god as
having now first existed within the universe, that it supposedly
created, because there could have been no place for it to exist
without a universe for it to exist in?

That is a sign of rational thinking BTW, but you've still got a long
way to go.

Or

Is yours, as it appears, the silly Kantian POC argument, that the
first man's (that's you) your first bit of knowledge exists, e.g. of
your god, in your head before your senses can first sense (initiate)
what your first bit of knowledge of god is about?

In other words, you're just making things up, inventing / initiating
silly ideas, to suit and excuse something you cant explain
rationally?

You Kantians are all as funny as each other and come in all sorts of
guises, but honestly, you might just as all be wearing a bright yellow
cone shaped pointed hat, eh chazzzzimmmm?

&gt; This does not mean that this world would require five unique
&gt; &quot;playgrounds&quot; for those events to occur.  However, it would imply some
&gt; sort of cyclical change whereby the world adapted from putting out one
&gt; groups of events followed by some change and then putting out a
&gt; different set of events.  I.E.  Not all events may be possible in any
&gt; one given instantiation of the world, but the different instantiations
&gt; of the world would need to be cyclical so that they do not prevent
&gt; themselves.  (this makes sense in my head, but I may not have
&gt; explained it well)

&gt; &gt; 4) None of this invovles god or gods outside the mind of man.

&gt; My arguments were primarily focused on a world without God(s).

&gt; &gt; 5) Your notion that the universe had a beginning involves an agent to
&gt; &gt; start the universe is false. If there existed an agent the start the
&gt; &gt; universe going then the universe had already begun becasue the egent
&gt; &gt; had to have existed already.
&gt; &gt; Or for the simple minded: who created god?

&gt; My initial premise was that something needs to be eternal.  I don't
&gt; know of any way to explain reality without including an idea of
&gt; eternality.  But that does not mean our world is eternal.  For this

I dont claim that my life has a point either. There are certain
artifacts and texts that have come to my attention, that combined,
describe a past the deviates from the Levantine view, and disturbs the
sensibilities of most people.

Etymology has reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (PIE) by collecting
the vocabularies of all the Aryan languages from Sanskrit &amp; Tocharian
to Germanic &amp; Latin, and now recently run them thru a computer to
identify the original common roots. With this in hand, they even found
a remote village in Turkey that *still* used the original PIE words
for fields &amp; crops in use 7000 years ago.

In a similar manner &quot;Did the Proto-Indo-European Priesthood Commit
Treason in the Period of PIE Unity?&quot; is an interesting little book,
and a monumental piece of scholarship, identifying similar clerical
passages in the religious traditions of the Germans, Romans, Greeks,
and Brahmins. They were unaware of the Tocharians, but they wrote
before China opened up.

But it turns out, that the reason the pope wears that funny hat is to
hide a beehive hairdo, and just like the original Aryan clerics, he
wears lace. He dont know they were all women. But it is an example of
a spiritual habit, pun intended, that stayed intact for 7000 years.

Now, none of this may exist in your reality; I can only report what
I've seen in mine. Cyberspace is a mono-dimensional technology that
can penetrate to reality systems I am not aware of.

The reality I see includes quantum physics and experimental results
that say that 10-11 dimensions are required to make the math work,
depending on which bishop you listen to. But whatever, the *scientific
proof* is that 3 dimensions and time will not explain what is going on
around me. So- I am not here to say what else cannot exist.

Ballantine's and Oswald's book mentioned above include cosmological
ideas that also date back 7000 years to this era of Aryan unity. One
of the clues is the Parthenon. It didnt have that name originally, but
was simply the house of Athena Parthenos. From etyology we know that
in PIE, the &quot;-os&quot; was the suffix for a sentient *female* being. &quot;-os&quot;
is also a PIE female possessive suffix.

We also have the word &quot;parthenogenic&quot; which means a lifeform which
reproduces without male insemmination. Which indeed was an attribute
of the original Great Earth Mother, which we see morphed into Athena.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Campbell, Gimbutas, and Eliade, we can see that the original
">

Aryan concept of the divine &quot;gave birth&quot; to reality out of Her own
innate instincts the same as any other mother. And She did so without
a divine plan to be fulfilled, but simply setting Her progeny free to
fulfill their own destiny the same as all other animal mothers.

So- all these questions about the catastrophies visited upon man are
not Her fault. Its your Kharma baby. Why you are here, that's your
problem as well. Lotsa luck. Not on my world anyway. There may be
others where you have some purpose. But whatever that is, dont prove
diddly shit about my reality.

&gt;&gt; have had some flaws in my logic.  However, what are those mistakes?
&gt;&gt; Are you saying it contains mistakes because you disagree with the
&gt;&gt; outcome or based off of some criteria?

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Though the universe may always have existed there is nothing to say
&gt;&gt; &gt; that every thing that could have happend already has. The universe
&gt;&gt; &gt; might ahve stayed unchanged since the beginning of time until it its
&gt;&gt; &gt; expansion and contraction.

&gt;&gt; If the world (I am not limiting the scope to simply the universe we
&gt;&gt; are aware of) was in some state and then changed to a different state,
&gt;&gt; it would have required some impetus to make this change.  Either this
&gt;&gt; &quot;shove&quot; was contained in the fundamental makeup of the world or it
&gt;&gt; required an outside source.  If the change was an internal phenomenon,
&gt;&gt; then this would be an indication of a naturally occurring event that
&gt;&gt; is governed by some probability which leads to the infinite
&gt;&gt; occurrences issue.  If the &quot;shove&quot; was an outside source then this
&gt;&gt; leads to an idea of &quot;intent&quot;.  If &quot;intent&quot; was introduced after the
&gt;&gt; world was created, then it is logical to assume that &quot;intent&quot; could be
&gt;&gt; linked to the origins of the world.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) It might ahve been expanding and contracting forever, but each
&gt;&gt; &gt; cycle is finite in time and so give limit and measure to the universe.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if the world is finite or not, but I don't see how that
&gt;&gt; limits the argument.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) Any eternal universe would also nee to be of infinite size in order
&gt;&gt; &gt; for everything to have happened already. We know this to be false
&gt;&gt; &gt; empirically because we can measure the limits of the growing universe.

&gt;&gt; I don't understand the logic behind this.  If every event that could
&gt;&gt; occur has occurred, it does not mean that each of these event have
&gt;&gt; occurred simultaneously (although I'm not sure how I could disprove
&gt;&gt; this).  Lets say our world was limited to a 100 event world where the
&gt;&gt; events where grouped into five sets of mutually exclusive events.
&gt;&gt; This does not mean that this world would require five unique
&gt;&gt; &quot;playgrounds&quot; for those events to occur.  However, it would imply some
&gt;&gt; sort of cyclical change whereby the world adapted from putting out one
&gt;&gt; groups of events followed by some change and then putting out a
&gt;&gt; different set of events.  I.E.  Not all events may be possible in any

all about.  For one thing, if there is no BEing...I always argue there is no
'sound in the forest when the tree falls'...but only waves that mean
nothing.  Existence is BEing.  Non-BEing is Non-Existence.
[and don't make the mistake of contemplation of the universe sans our
existence, not realizing any other conclusion remains a function of our
BEing...NOW...only while we exist].

The pitfall in this line of thinking, for me anyway, has been solipsism.  It
seems to lead one into a Caligua-like madness where god could very well be
one's self [since, once you die, it all disappears, from this line of
thinking].  There is no proof to disavow this...but common sense of course.

OK.

Let's say, in absolute terms, there is not, never was, never will be such
a state as nothingness. However, in the same terms, nothingness is a
necessity to because human thought demands limits. Enter 'cause'. Enter
'linear thinking'.

Looking at things as having 'a cause' can only lead to what Aquinas called
Primary Cause which, I think. was his main reasoned proof for the
existence of God. Makes for true sense, unless 'sense' itself is in error.

Let's say, for the sake of this discussion, that sense IS wrong, that
thought itself can't quite 'get it'. That the 'big bang' idea is another
'god' idea which are two ideas in a long string of theories which
essentially attempt answer the question, &quot;what is, or was, before the
very first thing?&quot;. Things seem to point to the uncomfortable conclusion
that the sense of the question is wrong.

If I want to build a computer my sense seems to serve me pretty well. Work
make sense. Discovery makes sense. Science makes sense. They work and
serve a tangible and real purpose with tangible products. Planning and
thoughtful consideration work, produce good results...so where does all
this good sense go wrong?

It seems that this all goes wrong very quickly when we mistake thought
for that which it is not, which is, in short, whatever we think about.
The thought of an apple is mistaken for the apple. The computation
is mistaken for what is being computed. The number or word is mistaken for
what they represent. The &quot;&quot;laws of nature&quot;&quot; is  mistaken for nature
itself.

If this is recognized and thought is seen for what it is via what it is
not, then something can certainly come from nothing for the very reason of
reasoning itself. Thought needs cause to function which leads ultimately
to some thing coming from nothing. Religion can call this 'god', science
can call this 'not yet known'... both, however, find a necessity in
a primal nothingness.

It's possible that something like the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation
of QM exists where all possible universes exist &quot;at once&quot;, so to
speak. We only realize one as &quot;real&quot;. Events in the others
are different ... not the same.

&gt;-   Since any event that occurs must have already occurred in the past

&gt;into one of three categories.  Either that event would encourage
&gt;further duplication of that event - I will label this category
&gt;&quot;good&quot;.  Or the event discourages further duplication of that event -
&gt;I will label this category &quot;evil&quot;.  Or this event has no overall
&gt;effect on the duplication of that event in a future context - I will
&gt;label this category &quot;neutral&quot;.  If an event is good in even the

&gt;again.  Given even the slightest amount of nudging multiplied by an
&gt;infinite number of occurrences would yield an event that always occurs
&gt;continuously to the exclusion of all else.  The same thing would apply
&gt;for an evil event.  Even the slightest amount of discouragement
&gt;multiplied by an infinite number of occurrences would mean that the
&gt;event could never happen.  However, from our perspective we definitely
&gt;see events that look good or evil.  So that means that each event that
&gt;is good must be balance out by some other event (or set of events)
&gt;that is evil so as to dampen the overall good effect to be zero.  The
&gt;same would have to be true for evil events.  This means that every

Nobody can prove the existence of God or even the existence
of transcendent realms. What can be proven, I think, is the
absurdity of your assumption that the physical universe
existed for a infinite time before &quot;now&quot;. The only way I can
see to look at the notion of uncaused ISNESS is to
imagine timeless (transcendent) realms where time has
no meaning. You have to consider that consciousness
or mind is fundamental and basically independent of
matter, space and time. Personally, I consider the
multiverses to be mental products. Everything that
exists is in the Mind of God. Everything that you experience
(and chose not to experience as well) is actually a
experience of your soul or spirit which is a conscious
energy gestalt. Nothing whatsoever is pointless or
meaningless.

&gt;&gt;My initial point of argument is that something has to be eternal (had
&gt;&gt;no beginning).

&gt; However, you claimed that your &quot;something&quot; is the physical world.
&gt; In that world, temporal cause operates. If there was no beginning
&gt; of the physical world, it's impossible to trace temporal causes. The
&gt; concept of temporal cause is then meaningless. Therefore, both the
&gt; world and time must have had a beginning. Possibly there are
&gt; many or infinite beginnings ... repetitive Big Bang and Collapse
&gt; cycles.

&gt;&gt;Either our world is eternal or the thing/process that
&gt;&gt;created it is.  This would be in contrast to the idea that our world
&gt;&gt;suddenly started with no outside stimuli.  I discount this point of
&gt;&gt;view because there is no evidence to support it and it is
&gt;&gt;scientifically impossible (in any test environment we cannot create
&gt;&gt;something from nothing).

&gt;&gt;So given this as a starting point, I will discuss the first option -
&gt;&gt;that our world is eternal.

&gt;&gt;My theory that I will attempt to prove is that if our world is eternal
&gt;&gt;than our existence has no meaning - I know I'm a bright and cheery
&gt;&gt;guy.

&gt;&gt;- If our world is eternal then any event that can happen has already
&gt;&gt;happened.  By this I mean that any event that is possible can be
&gt;&gt;described by some probability.  This probability would state that
&gt;&gt;given some finite time span a certain event will occur.  This means
&gt;&gt;that given an infinite time span that event will have occurred an
&gt;&gt;infinite number of times -because infinity would contain an infinite
&gt;&gt;number of time spans (no matter what length) each of which would
&gt;&gt;contain the event at least once.

&gt; You'd have to assume that all events in every Big Bang-Collapse cycle
&gt; are identical. I think you'd have no way of knowing or proving that
&gt; hypothesis :)

&gt;&gt;- Any event that we see occur would be described as possible and as
&gt;&gt;such must already have occurred an infinite amount of times.

&gt; It's possible that something like the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation
&gt; of QM exists where all possible universes exist &quot;at once&quot;, so to
&gt; speak. We only realize one as &quot;real&quot;. Events in the others

&gt;&gt;further duplication of that event - I will label this category
&gt;&gt;&quot;good&quot;.  Or the event discourages further duplication of that event -
&gt;&gt;I will label this category &quot;evil&quot;.  Or this event has no overall
&gt;&gt;effect on the duplication of that event in a future context - I will

This is the major flaw as I mentioned in another post, and I think the crux
of why 'finite' time is ultimately illogical.  With finite time, one must
come upon a point where there is no causality.  Granted, we may be looking
into realms simply beyond our ability to 'reason', but as most rationalists
would argue in every other subject, it's all we have to find solutions.
Either our reason fails, or we must entertain infinite time as real.  Why
would our reason fail when there is no prior condition before that point to
suggest it would...again, one of those leaps of faith perhaps?

So, point 1 to solve...is time finite or infinite?  And to solve that, one
must answer can there be any event without cause [something from nothing
conundrum]?

From that point, now read all that MichealNJ posted.

Also, as I think now, if one concludes that infinite time 'must' be real,
then I make the association that BEing itself must be it's anchor...it's
source.  I think ZerkonX was flirting with that answer in his 8/28 10:47am
post.  I think you diehard athiests [any that may be around] need to revisit
your conclusions...not that emphatically God does exist, but that there are
gaping holes that allow for God's possibility...or some sentience beyond our
own (or perhaps that we are a part of, but subservient, unawares)  that at
least seeded all this.  Arrogance can be the only resource of atheism.

Also, can someone explain what a 'singularity' is?  Science likes to throw
that around along with Sir Frederick...kinda like the word 'magic' once was
perhaps....catchall word that means nothing, but confabulates the
imagination of the natives.  It all started as a 'singularity' is supposed
to quiet my imagination and quest to understand...ha...fat chance. Better
just to say 'WE DON'T KNOW'.
