i hate to sound callous, o.k. maybe i don't.  but he took his chances.  he
rode a motorcycle without a helmet and apparently without health insurance.
anyone that has a family to support and takes those chances should be
chastised severely if not out and out beaten.  (i bet i get some flack from
that one)  if you are so selfish to put your family in that potential
situation then you are a slime of the lowest order.

if you have a wife and kids and think you can't afford health insurance to
protect them financially then *sell your bike and use the money to buy
some.*  if you have insurance then maybe taking the chance on riding
helmetless is o.k.  but if you actually think about your kids and grandkids
needs instead of your own selfish desires i would think a rational person
would wear the lid.  oh yeah, and a DOT approved unit instead of a novelty
helmet.  i have never understood why someone would wear one of those.  if
you want to thumb your nose at the man then just ride without it and make a
real statement.

There, I snipped some of your post so that it sounds exactly like my dear
ole mom.  She was over yesterday for my eldests 7th birthday and was saying
that she was worried about my upcoming trip to Vermont, not so much for my
sake but because she doesn't want the kids to grow up without a father (I'm
sure ML could clean herself up, do some situps, and find a new man...I'm SO
glad she doesn't read this group).  I agree with your statement though, if
you have people depending on you, especially kids, you should take some
precautions, be it the wearing of protective gear or insurance.  Fortunately
in Canada the gub'ment takes care of the medical bills, and I've taken to
wearing a fullface helmet for the past couple years (more because it gets
damned cold in winter).

Having said that, I think it should be the individuals choice whether to
protect themselves or not, but up here we've got far too many safety nazis.
There was a car crash in New Brunswick last week in which four teenage boys
were killed (passing in a no passing zone and hit a truck head on).  The
news is all over it and people are demanding tougher laws for new drivers.
Come on, one crash and it's making the news in another province??  Obviously
this sort of thing doesn't happen enough to warrant tougher driving laws.
By tougher driving laws I mean graduated licenses that are more restrictive
than the ones already in place.

I hate it when something bad happens to someone (like the little girl in the
original story) and they think this gives them the right or gawd given
responsibility to protect the rest of us from ourselves.

i really hope they don't socialize medicine here in the u.s. but that is
another subject.  my personal belief is that if someone is going to marry
and raise kids that protecting them should become a priority.  while i
believe in having a good time, doing it at the financial risk of your kids
is so selfish it doesn't even warrant discussion.  do i think someone with
kids should ride a motorcycle?  absolutely.  but they should at least be
prepared to take care of them financially if something goes wrong.  if this
guy didn't have medical insurance i bet he also skipped on the life
insurance.  so potentially there is a kid out there who is fatherless,
penniless and starting life from so deep in a hole that it will challenge
her the rest of her life.  the financial impact is going to be as much of a
challenge for her as the pshychological issues from losing a parent.  least
he could have done is not have burdened the family with multiple compounding
issues.  i am sypathetic for the kids sake and am just boggled by the
decision making process that left this poor child and her mother in such a
precarious position.

i think a helmet should be a personal choice.  but when you make that choice
you need to factor in more than *your* &quot;freedom of choice&quot;.  responsibility
to family should weigh in on the decision.

i personally have jam up medical insurance, disability insurance and life
insurance.  i am worth much more incapacitated or dead than my value whole.
if i crash my bike and end up a quadraplegic tonight my medical bills are
covered, i will get a big enough check every month to pay my bills and even
the people i might injure in the process are covered.  if i die the ol lady
is instantly rich and she can go buy herself a young stud to travel the
world on my dime.  if i choose to ride naked and without a helmet at 200 mph
i have at least taken responsibility for the financial repurcussions of that
act.

my wife has the same insurance protections as i do.  when we cross into
south carolina she will often take her helmet off as allowed by law and
accept responsibility for her action.  if we had kids i would not allow her
to do that.  (yeah, i am stepping up to the plate now)  but since we are
childless, she is insured and capable of making her own decision on the
subject we ride on with big grins on our faces.  me?  i keep my helmet on.
my choice.

but anyone that can pop 10 to 20K for a bike then say they can't &quot;afford&quot;
insurance is lying.  they are selfish and thus do not deserve any respect
from me.  their family will get my sympathy but i will say what i think
about the individual that put his family in that position.

as far as dangerous activities, riding a motorcyle is one of the safest
things i do.  my real passion is high altitude mountaineering.  falling
rocks, falling ice, avalanches, and just making a poor decision will kill a
climber faster than you can blink.  at one point i made the decision that if
i had kids i would quit.  i never had kids so i have not had to give up that
sport. i have lost 4 friends in mountaineering accidents just this year.
none of them had kids or left spouses behind.  when you choose to do
something deadly, limit the fallout.

i think everyone should have the right to do whtever they want as long as it
doesn't impact others significantly.  if they want to smoke meth until they
die it is fine to me.  but if they have kids i am apalled.  you wanna smoke
cigarettes, fine by me.  if a woman does it during pregancy then she is
taking big chances with a life that is not her on.  when your decisions
affect others financial security or health then consider taking some
responsibility.

life is a dying proposition.  it is going to happen to us all.  acting like
it won't is ignorant.  pretending like it can't happen five minutes from now
is just as dumb.  if your walking around in a position to leave your family
financially despondent then do what it takes to secure their future with
some insurance.  if it means selling your bike, selling your bass boat,
abstaining from the 100 a week bar tab, not buying a bag of pot every
friday, getting a better job, getting a second job, or whatever it takes
then you can't convince me that you have any true love in your heart for you
family.  if you love them you will at least protect them financially.  after
you have provided for them financially in the event of your incapacitation
or death then you can pour the little extras on top like bikes, booze and
cars.

Responsibility for the bills falls to the operator and his family.  If you

&gt; first we do not know the insurance laws pertaining to motorcylists

&gt; know if he could even get med coverage while riding a mc,

&gt; In fl it is darn near impossible to get med pay coverage and darn

&gt; through state farm for the motorcyclist

&gt; and without  pip ?

&gt; now what is more surprising is that accident was the other drivers

&gt; I do every day I ride my motorcycle, I bet you do as well, you just do

&gt; you might want to check your health insurance coverages to see what

My med bills  totalled nearly 40k  . My health plan paid most of that ,
but they want their money back (and the folks that treated me want the rest
...) . The fact that the dude that I hit was uninsured means my UM coverage
pays it all - including lost wages , and P&amp;S money . State Farm will NOT

of course we are going to be the ones to pay whether we want to or not, thus
our right to gripe.  his wife will recieve social security benefits until
she remarrys.  the kid will get social security until she turns 18.  we will
pay the medical bills through increased costs added to our hospital bills to
cover the indigent care.

i for one, don't think we need socialized medicine, hillary care or any
other such government funded or controlled healthcare.  i am currently
paying over 2,000 dollars a month in total insurace premiums.  i could get

i have a good friend who works as a claims adjuster for state farm.  in
private he recommends to all of his friends to run from state farm as fast
as they can.  i'll not say anymore in here but ya'll can ask me about it
IRL.  &quot;like a good neighbor&quot; *not*.

he recommends farm bureau.  i have used them for decades.  i have had three
claims all settled beyond my satisfaction.  last one was when lighting
struck the house and blew up my home entertainment center.  i went and
bought a new high def wide screen, denon surround processor, nice dvd
player, new speakers and all of the wiring to hook it up.  also bought a
specialized isolated battery backup that is supposed to actually stop
lightning from getting in to the electronics.  i dropped a copy of the
reciepts off at my local farm bureau office and within a week a check came
in the mail.  the check was for more than i had paid for all fo the stuff
even after the deductible had been taken out.  i called my agent to ask why
and he said i bought all the stuff on sale and he based the payout on the
retail price from the manufactureres website.  i actually upgraded every
component and they paid me about 50 bucks more than my actual cost.

Let me know so I can get my son to file an appeal. When his
wife died, he received a one time death benefit payout of
$250. Now, when he gets old enough to draw social security
he'll draw either his or hers, whichever is more....and
since he had the rest of his life to contribute, his will be
more (assumption) since she died when she was 28.

Agreed.  Those numbers sound inflated to me, but wtf do I know? I'm just
an engineering student.

What I &gt;DO&lt; know is that Mr. Chapman was likely taken to St. Alphonsus
hospital because its close and they have the region's best equiped trauma

the full amount as they do a lot of charitable write-offs.

I also know that the fault for this tragedy lies with the bitch that
pulled out in front of Mr. Chapman.

i will stand by what i said.  if my wife and i had kids she would wear her
helmet whenever we rode.  i allow her to make any choice she wants but there
are certain things i wouldn't allow and her still continue to live in my
house as my wife.  no cooking meth in the bathtub, no selling herself on the
street corner, no muling drugs from south america.  no butchering innocent
people in the back yard with a chainsaw.  she could do that stuff if she
really wanted to but the marriage partnership would have to be dissolved if
these things were happening.

if anyone thinks this is slavery then they are mistaken.  marriage is a
partnership where two people are willing to make compromises for the
relationship when necessary.  so is your ol lady going to tell you to stop
something if she feels it is not a healthy choice for your kids?  if she
does it becomes your choice to honor her wishes or not.  we all make our
covenants with our spouces in a way that we can each live with.  there are
things i will not do because they displease my wife.  same with her.  i call
that mutual respect.  respect is imperative for a healthy lifelong
relationship.

i wouldn't say she couldn't ride her motorcycle, i would just exercise my
50% vote in the marriage partnership to see that the lid was worn.  my
belief is that when a couple has kids, their needs take presidence over the
parents desires.  if we had kids she would wear a stinking helmet.  just
like if we had kids i would quit high altitude mountaineering.  you don't
have to like how we run our marriage.  as long as we are content and not
breaking any of the government laws on spousal abuse all is good, eh?

there ain't no slavery implied or intended with that statement.  if you
think it is then either your reading comprehension skills are poor or your
views of the marriage covenant are skewed.  this ideal works both ways.
there are a few things my ol lady won't tolerate herself.  does that mean i
am her slave?  i think not.

&gt;he recommends farm bureau.  i have used them for decades.  i have had three

&gt;bought a new high def wide screen, denon surround processor, nice dvd

&gt;specialized isolated battery backup that is supposed to actually stop
&gt;lightning from getting in to the electronics.  i dropped a copy of the
&gt;reciepts off at my local farm bureau office and within a week a check came
&gt;in the mail.  the check was for more than i had paid for all fo the stuff
&gt;even after the deductible had been taken out.  i called my agent to ask why
&gt;and he said i bought all the stuff on sale and he based the payout on the
&gt;retail price from the manufactureres website.  i actually upgraded every

I think you're too quick to judge what constitutes risk management and what
constitutes risky activity. People die in plenty of other ways besides what
you call risky activity. We have kids, young kids. We're raising our kids to
go after life. To enjoy it to it's fullest and to manage the risks sometimes
associated with living life to it's fullest with intent and care. I hope
they live their lives that way too. Everyone's got to make decisions of
what's excessive risk and what isn't. Many people if asked would say riding
a motorcycle at all is highly risky. You say riding one without a helmet is
to dangerous and if you do it and have kids it's outright irresponsible.
Sounds a bit judgemental to me. One odd thing that jumped out at me in your
posts here is that you state that you and your wife are highly insured yet
don't have children. I'm not sure I get that. The only reason my wife &amp; I
have a decent amount of insurance is 100% because of our kids. I don't need
my wife to get rich on my undue end nor visa versa (though she may think
otherwise lol).

Where's the cutoff? Flying airplanes? Back country skiing? Is it
irresponsible to be a parent and ride a bicycle without a helmet? To me,
it's all about risk management. I can mitigate some risks by improving
safety in other ways. But nothing I do is risk free and that's exactly as I
like it.

i realize that life comes with risks.  in fact i probably take more risks
than anyone on this group except for maybe active military personell.  what
i look at is the ability to rationally minimize the potential of injury and
or death while participating in a risky endeavour.  i have spent my life
rock climbing, ice climbing, high altitude mountaineering, back country
skiing, bicycling, motorcycling, caving, skateboarding, shooting guns and
playing with fast cars.  i put myself at risk all of the time.

when i climb in rock or ice fall areas i wear a helmet and move through the
danger zones quickly.  i have taken several avalanche prediction and rescue
courses and wear transponders when skiing in the backcountry.  when i put
together a high altitude climbing team i make sure and have a medic, an
avalache professional, local guides and any specialist that might be
critical for making the climb and getting home alive.  when i skate and plan
on grinding hard i put a lid on.  i wear a helmet at all times on a bicycle.
i think bicycling is potentially more dangerous than motorcycles.

i feel the only reason i have survived some of the things i have done is by
being prepared for the worst.  if i had kids they would go rock and ice
climbing if they wanted but due to my experience i can limit the risk
significantly.  in fact it is much safer than motorcycling because your
safety is dependent on your own skills and the likely hood of getting hit by
a woman eating fried chicken on the cliff is almost zero.  if i had kids
they would ski, ride dirt bikes, shoot guns and all of that.  but i would
use my years of experience to ensure that it was in as safe of an
environment as possible.

thus the helmet for parents idea.  if i was a complete ralph nader moron i
would say parents shouldn't ride motorcycles at all.  but putting on the lid
is so simple and protects your safety so much in the event of a low speed
accident that it just makes sense.  at 70 mph on the open highway i think
most of the statistics seem to indicate i doesn't matter if you are wering a
helmet on not if you hit a tree or a truck.  but at speeds of under 45 mph
in city driving they show a significant decrease in risk of severe injury or
death.  i think kids deserve that little extra consideration.

as to the insurance thing.  i run a fairly involved business and have the
usual risks associated with that.  every 5 years i sit down with my
financial advisor and my insurance agent.  we look at planning for
retirement and the results if i got killed.  my ol lady could not run this
business without me.  her retirement would also be jeapordized without my
wage earning for at least a few more years and vice versa.  if i get whacked
i don't want her saddled with trying to come into the shop, hire morons that
don't care and fight for fiscal survival.

my life insurance is broken into two different policies.  i have a term life
policy that is renegotiated every ten years and is based on debt.  when i
was in my 20's and had multiple truck payments, building payments, equipment
payments and so forth the term plicy was 500k so that my death benefits
would pay off all of the debt and leave a little for the wife to live off
of.  in my 30's we were able to reduce that to 300k of term because my debt
had gone down.  in just a couple of years it will be time to renew the term
again.  my debt is almost non existent at this point so it will be reduce to
100k.  that would leave enough money to pay the g-mans inheritance taxes
without her having to sell the farm to pay taxes.

same with her.  we have just enough insurance on her that if she kicks off i
won't have to borrow money at the bank to pay taxes on her retirement
accounts.  financial planning is complicated and we do what the professional
we have hired recommend.  we also each have a small whole life policy that
will leave enough to bury us and pay out a few extra bucks.  when i start
approaching my 60's term life will become unaffordable and i will drop all
of the term.  the small whole life will be paid in full by then so by the
time i am 60 the only insurance i'll have to pay will be homeowners and
vehicles.  it all goes back to feeling a responsibiblity of not leaving my
spouse in a lurch or even them stinking bankers.

of course when it is all said and done our time will come even if we die
falling in the bath tub or of old age.  my plan is to have lots of fun, do a
lot of really crazy stuff and live to tell about it in my golden years as i
sit on the front porch and rock in my chair.  i feel risk management is a
key component to achieving that goal.

I tend to agree, but just for the record, this accident occured about
6,000 FEET from the best trauma center in Idaho.  They did not call out Life

That's a very import lesson that I learned early on, from Tom I believe.  If
you keep some of the bikes dismanteled then they really don't know how many
you have.  I recall hearing that Tom had three panheads and a shovelhead,

When I retired, I cut my life insurance coverage to just
enough to bury my dumb ass.........anything more than that
is a waste of premium $$$'s.

In my younger days I carried life insurance to help provide
for my family in case something happened to me. Now that I'm
retired, and my pension payout is not dependent on me being
alive (wife gets 100% until the day she dies if I go first,
and our kids are all grown up and gone)......there's no need
for me to waste money every month paying premiums.

Our insurance on her went up some though, since she's still
working......had to be enough to bury her AND take care of
enough of the bills to NOT make me go back to work. &lt;sfsf&gt;

How about a little role reversal?? I'm retired, my wife is

I still do all the &quot;man chores&quot;, but have also assumed
pretty much all the &quot;women's work&quot;. She still insists on
doing her own laundry.....go figure, I don't see anything
wrong with washing my t-shirts and jeans in the same load.....

I think the decision to do it this way (on my part) was
conscious..... I thought about it and made up my mind that
since she was working a 10 hour day (she works 4/10's with
every Fri/Sat/Sun off) and me being home a lot...there was
no reason she should be coming home and making my dinner,
cleaning my house, washing my dishes, etc.

Doesn't take much effort for me to keep the house clean,
vacuum a couple times a week, make sure I load, run, empty
the dishwasher (since we're empty nester's the dishwasher
thing only has to run 2 maybe 3 times a week &lt;sfsf&gt;). I
always cooked some, now I cook most of the time and even try
new things a lot.......

I've never washer her truck......she stops at the car wash,
gets a discount with a fillup, and a further discount with
her &quot;corporate discount card&quot; thingy......
