GREAT EASTERN for Charlotte  Russes.... FOUR N' TWENTY PIES for great Banana
Cream....HILLSIDE BAKE SHOPPE  for great rye bread served with a beautiful
smile by Mrs. Cahill.....GOODY'S for  Lime-Rickies and a greasy burger....
Remember each September when the automobile  truck carriers would ride along Francis
Lewis with the new models covered with  white sheeting.  We would wonder what
the new models would look like.   Back then cars changed every year and we
were adept to naming the years and  models.  Happy memories everybody and let's
raise our glasses that we  survived another summer and look forward to the
times ahead.  Big  Lube

Yes my dear....how could I forget Happy Robin?  A truly wonderful place....

Do we recall Kiddie City?  Now a golf driving range on Northern Blvd.  But a wonderland for Hilltop kids.   The kosher deli on Hillside, which was pretty generic. I remember reiding bikes to Burger King on Hillside and 179th.....and Lou's Snack Bar, owned by Lou and Doris Hirsch at the subway, where I never paid for a soda, hot dog or knish.....

The shopping cventer was great because it was all family owned---we knew all the merchants....Teddy the fishman, Sammy and Nathan the butchers, the guys at Goodie's (before Artie Menaker), Gene at Gene's, Freddie and John and the crew at Gabys......Today the shopping center in mjy neighborhood (Bayside) is populated by chain and franchise stores----Applebees, Outback, Barnes and Noble, Victoria's Secret (well, this one I like), Foot-Locker, The gap, etc....who knows who opwns or manages these places, and who cares?

Oh, yes, Kiddie City. What treat to go there. The rides were soooo big back then.

The Ritz bakery- yes, my dad just loved  the chocolate blackout cake!!!! The filling was like a pudding. Costco here sells small black and white cookies, not the same, though, and the southerners just do not hunger for a good bagel ,and do not know what a bialy or pletzel is!!! We did just get a NY style deli (Not Kosher) that makes bagels the NY way (I asked how they shaped them). Boy, did they smell up the car on the way home, yum.

On the other hand, did you all eat macaroni (we did not call it pasta back then) with ketchup? That was a specialty of my mom's. We had shells, elbows and spaghetti.  Ronzoni. My Italian friends cringe when I tell them that!!! (So do my non-Italian friends)

Scott,
I am in Richmond, VA. Before  that I lived in Norfolk for 8 years. Before that, Louisville, KY for three years.
My daughter, Sarah ,lives in Greensboro.  She produces the 5 PM news program for the CBS affiliate- WFMY. She has been there since June, 2006, moving there from Idaho Falls. It's not all that far from Richmond, unless there is an accident on 85 (there were two the last time I was there)

Loved Kiddie City!!!  Remember those white light bulbs strung up along Northern Blvd, by Kiddie City???!!!!  It was like going to a Carnival!!! with rides.

Bakeries---mmmm...delish!!  I loved both the bakeries--right across the street from each other, on Hillside Ave, and yet they both seemed to do a good business.
I find it extremely difficult to find a &quot;Good Cheese Danish&quot;!!!---I always have to compare it to the Ritz Bake Shop's delicious, perfect cheese danish---the best!  And I loved the layer cakes, and checkerboard cake by the slice....i loved the yellow cake w/mocha filling and frosting, chocolate sprinkes on the outside of the frosted cake, and a beautiful pink rose in the center......mmmm and what size cake did you want?  the $1.25 or the $1.50? Yep, those were the prices for the entire layer cake!

And Red Robin----yummy char-broiled hamburgers and cherry soda and my fav----little colorful umbrellas in the soda!  and the outdoor eating area....they were ahead of their time.....loved it there.

You are making me hungry!!!!  If you're in Manhattan, a Johnny Rockets just opened midtown, at East 56th STreet ON THIRD AVE...ON THE CORNER.  There is also one in the the Village....around 8th stgreet and greene street.

gotta go, i have to eat something now....i've been munching on the most amazing chocolate crisp things.....O'coco's  they're Organic baked chocolate crisps w/cinnamon and sgar on 'em.....90 calories a bag.....great .   Really Cool Foods sells em  $5 a box of 6 bags.

I've gotta say that you guys sure know how to bring a smile to my lips
at the end of  this very long day with these forgotten memories and
yummy reminders of treats from my youth! Wow..Kiddie City!!   I used
to love to go there!  I can't believe you were able to  remember it
all these years later!  I must say that my memory sure isn't that
defined!   and the Ritz Bake Shoppe too!   My mom's favorite cake was
the chocolate hard icing yellow cake with a  filling like seven layer
cake  (also with the little pink rose with green leaves  on top!) and
my dad used to buy us  each a Charlotte Rousse on special occasions.
Back then it was politically and socially acceptable to use food a
reward !  I liked those days! Shelley

I can't believe this.  I thought my mother was the only one who served
spaghetti with ketchup!  And as for Burger King, Rozzie and I used to
ride out bikes to 179th and pool our money to share a whopper junior and
soda - it was probably less than a dollar at that time.

I've gotta say that you guys sure know how to bring a smile to my lips
at the end of  this very long day with these forgotten memories and
yummy reminders of treats from my youth! Wow..Kiddie City!!   I used
to love to go there!  I can't believe you were able to  remember it
all these years later!  I must say that my memory sure isn't that
defined!   and the Ritz Bake Shoppe too!   My mom's favorite cake was
the chocolate hard icing yellow cake with a  filling like seven layer
cake  (also with the little pink rose with green leaves  on top!) and
my dad used to buy us  each a Charlotte Rousse on special occasions.
Back then it was politically and socially acceptable to use food a
reward !  I liked those days! Shelley

Our mom also used ketchup on spaghetti at times, but usually if the spaghetti was accompanying salmon croquettes...

Other standards in our house were meatloaf, meatballs and spaghetti, pot roast (with onion gravy), chicken cutlets, liver and onions (yuck!!!), fish (from Teddy the fish man), london broil, noodles and cheese (Goodmans egg noodles with butter and pot cheese), chicken fricassee, stuffed cabbage....  There was always a dinner salad, and lots of vegetables and starches---potatoes, rice, noodles.....No wonder I fought the battle of the bulge....but nobody cooked like our moms.....and remember, we all had our own particular seat at the table---very territorial.....

How many kept the TV set on through dinner?

OK, OK,  I ate that too, and I loved it...at the time.....and as I got a tad older, I got a bit creative, and one morning, for breakfast, no less, I added cottage cheese to the spaghetti and ketchup, and I gotta tell you, I loved it!!!

And, I loved &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot;, remember when they came out?!!  It was a &quot;new shaped&quot; macaroni.

And, I can recall eating a slice of sooo soft &quot;Wonder Bread&quot; (white) and butter with sugar sprinkled on top, (I loved it! --it was a snack, not dinner) and then, lo and behold, on TV's &quot;Family Affair&quot;, a &quot;poor family&quot; had that snack!!!!!  LOL
My Mom had turned me on to that butter/sugar treat.

Yes, I think it was Buitoni- the wagon wheels. Oy, the memories.
And Arthur, my mom made liver and onions (thank goodness) infrequently.  Also, the flounder topped with campbells alphabet soup! Yuck!!  And the shabbos meat loaf- ground beef, salt and pepper, with a hard boiled egg in the middle. Now there was a need for lots of ketchup to get it down!!!

OK, OK,  I ate that too, and I loved it...at the time.....and as I got a tad older, I got a bit creative, and one morning, for breakfast, no less, I added cottage cheese to the spaghetti and ketchup, and I gotta tell you, I loved it!!!

And, I loved &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot;, remember when they came out?!!  It was a &quot;new shaped&quot; macaroni.

And, I can recall eating a slice of sooo soft &quot;Wonder Bread&quot; (white) and butter with sugar sprinkled on top, (I loved it! --it was a snack, not dinner) and then, lo and behold, on TV's &quot;Family Affair&quot;, a &quot;poor family&quot; had that snack!!!!!  LOL
My Mom had turned me on to that butter/sugar treat.

I've gotta say that you guys sure know how to bring a smile to my lips
at the end of this very long day with these forgotten memories and
yummy reminders of treats from my youth! Wow..Kiddie City!! I used
to love to go there! I can't believe you were able to remember it
all these years later! I must say that my memory sure isn't that
defined! and the Ritz Bake Shoppe too! My mom's favorite cake was
the chocolate hard icing yellow cake with a filling like seven layer
cake (also with the little pink rose with green leaves on top!) and
my dad used to buy us each a Charlotte Rousse on special occasions.
Back then it was politically and socially acceptable to use food a
reward ! I liked those days! Shelley

Remember the burger joint on Union Tpke that served the food on a little train??  (Robin Jaffe's mother would never let her go with us) Also, Lynny, do you remember getting pickles at Gene's Deli and walking home with them in a plastic bag??  Also, girls, remember going to Flushing to buy jeans????  Though I was partial to the bakery where my mom worked, do you remember that brown wedding cake that was in the window of Ritz Bakery FORever??   Geeez.  I also now am remembering Bohack Harry who lived behind Bohacks.  Having lived in the Everest I had a great view of him.  What about Salvatores????

Mays/Gertz in Jamaica and mom and pop stores in Flushing for clothes...

Rozzie and I used to make a day of it.  Shop for hours on a Saturday
and come home with one pair of colored Levis for $2.99 that we would put
on, sit in a tub until they shrunk to our bodies, and then let dry.
Rozzie also had a sewing machine so she could make them even tighter.
This was when we were in junior high and sexy was in.

Maddie was the &quot;spoiled &quot; one.  She always had Fred Brauns.  Rozzie and
I could not afford them.  Hey Maddie, I'm still jealous!

In high school the styles changed.  No more make-up, dresses, or very
tight clothes.  Instead, we wore the &quot;uniform&quot;.  Jeans, dungaree jacket
or army jacket.  In the winter, we wore our dungaree jacket over the
army jacket.  Remember Ronnie O and his dungaree jacket with the
&quot;support Chavez grape pickers&quot; symbol on the back?  Wonder if he still
has it.

BTW - I still have a pair of jeans from Diskins, all patched up.  I
also still have my earth shoes and my ugly work boots from this store in
Flushing that I wore until there were holes on the bottom.  Sure can't
fit into those jeans now!

I think of these things when I see my teen dressing so strange.

Do you remember Diskins in Flushing? There was a huge pair of pants hanging in the doorway. The waist was the width of the doorway.....and a sign saying that if they fit you, they were yours free!?

Remember the high waisted bell bottom jeans that had like 8 fake buttons sewed up on the outside of the fly? We used to fold them down to make really low hip huggers and wrap a long sash around the top of the pants.

Sandi, Ellie and I used to go to the big library in Jamaica and stop for custard donuts at the bus terminal.? Sometimes if we had extra money between us, we would stop at Burger King on the way home....but that meant paying twice for the bus ride.? A nickel (with the bus pass) was alot of money back then!!

Ronnie Colfin and I used to work at Lamstons in Jamaica. They handed me a broom one day and told me to sweep...I handed it right back and quit on the spot!!

Good times!

Annette
