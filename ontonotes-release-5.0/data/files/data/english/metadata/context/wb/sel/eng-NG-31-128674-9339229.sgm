Dear Friends,

To share the journey of NEEV with all of you has always been a very
rewarding experience for me, one because I get the occasion to talk to
myself and secondly I get the occasion to intertwine my personal journey
with the journeys of all my friends. Social work is not just about projects
and funds. It is actually never that. It's all about the stuff of humans. I
read somewhere that the world is not made of atoms, it is made of stories.
It means that our view of the world has become increasingly materialistic,
even our relationships acquire the hue of materialistic interests at various
levels from seeking money, to power to emotional comfort to sex. Once we
shift from our materialistic perspective we see that there is a world where
everything is a story, an unfolding process, sometimes soft and beautiful,
sometimes cold and brutal and sometimes silent and mellow. You can read it
in the face of an old woman, a dead leaf laying on the pavement, a rich man
getting out from his car or a child frolicking in the rain.

I did not intend to write philosophically at all, but in the space and
leisure that writing provides me, I unwittingly slip into this mode. My
apologies to all my friends who take offence in this digression!!

NEEV Soap Stall - G Town, Bistupur, Jamshedpur

Yesterday we found ourselves on the other side of the counter and when we
are on the other side of anything we come to know a different story. We come
back enriched with life's vast treasure of stories. Well we had put up a
stall in an exhibition at G-Town, Bistupur in Jamshedpur to sell our
Handmade Herbal Soaps. I don't mind it if most of you would be put off at
this point and think that I am elevating something extremely banal to
resounding philosophy. Yet, if I am able to succeed in the task of showing
that there is nothing banal anytime, anywhere - I would give myself a small
pat for having achieved a small milestone as a writer.

Usually we were the ones who visited various fairs, walking down the aisles,
with salesmen and vendors vying for our attention while we stroll about with
an imperial gait, a slight smug which sometimes even approaches disdain. It
does not matter that we are doing a small, menial job - might have just
returned after having received a lashing from the boss for a work poorly
done or that we must have just had licked our supervisor's boots for getting
that promotion. We forget our Lilliputian status as a cog in the world of
global capitalism.

Once you are in the market, by default, by the strange and mysterious laws
of the market - you are the king. Customer is the King! - So the saying
goes.

Yesterday, due to the quirks of destiny and the strange eccentricities of
personal choices in life we were given the mantle of making people fee as
Kings and Queens. When we started off we just sat quietly for an hour or so
as we saw people walk past our stall, some without even caring to give a
glance. Finally, Shikha decided to take things head-on and go into the
salesmanship mode. I buried my head as deep as I could, even trying to slink
into oblivion as I waited for the all the things which any self respecting
man dreads and abhors - the condescending looks, the ignoring looks, the
disdainful looks, the vile looks, the smug looks and I just discovered a
special kind of look yesterday. I bet you all must have mastered it by now.
There is a look which goes straight into you and through you, past you as if
you didn't even exist. This look comes quite in handy for beggars, street
urchins, roadside vendors and hawkers. It's the look of one class of people
for another class of people. In this case it's the look from one side of the
counter to another side of the counter.

Human kind would have been deemed to failure, if not for good souls. Who's a
good soul? Yesterday at least I had a simple test. All those who buy NEEV
Herbal Handmade Soaps are good souls. I am sure you all would agree to my
test. Aren't we socially responsible, environment friendly and giving the
highest quality? Those who don't agree with me and fail my test, I term them
the bad guys and I spent considerable time yesterday developing a lexicon
for them, greedy lip smacking consumers, narcissistic hedonists, mean minded
misers,  brand conscious megalomaniacs, insensitive materialists and so on.
We had some good guys, the ones who keep the hope of humanity alive and many
bad guys, the ones who live in darkness to our stall yesterday.

What touched me the most was the camaraderie, generosity and team spirit of
the adjacent stall owners? Friends, some of these guys are great. You have
to watch them from the other side of the counter to see their greatness.
These are guys who travel 9 months around the year putting up their wares in
different parts of the country - selling, hoping, shouting, yelling. It's
like the life of a circus. Before Shah Rukh Khan became the Don, he acted in
a serial called Circus - It was a lovely serial which shared the same
spirit, the joys and sorrows of people behind the show. As soon as I reached
my stall yesterday, one of them virtually served me his product - a milk
shake, not because he wanted to sell it (Shikha had already purchased one
packet earlier) but as a kind of welcome and acknowledgement that we belong
to that grand fraternity which makes common people forget their smallness
and make them feel a king. One of them came and hammered our banner. You can
accuse me at this point of being lob-sided and sentimental. You would say -
look they are just doing pure, simple business. I will not deny this charge
totally. But guys, I tell you - look at them form the other side of the
counter. It's not so simple. The two guys on the stall across ours did not
make much of a sale but there was a twinkle in their eyes, a hint of
mischievousness as they tried to rope in the King customers. Some customers
walked off after listening to their salesman's pitch (which these vendors
must have repeated the millionth time). But, I could not detect a hint of
bitterness in their faces. There was just mirth and laughter in them. I
realized that like stage actors, they had also mastered an art form and you
cannot separate the product from the art of salesmanship. We give dignity
and money to the stage actor. More than that, it was a visible demonstration
of how to convert adversity into a source of happiness. My heart goes out to
the small guys. I learnt a lot of the stuff of human spirit from them. I
hate the big retail shops where the brands speak more than this art. Those
who have the gall to put up boards like &quot;Fixed Price&quot; and people acquiesce
to it because they want the identity of a brand name. Of course the art of
the salesman should not be used for selling spurious and inferior stuff,
which unfortunately does happen in most cases. As we prepared to go, some of
the stall owners came to us. One of them was particularly fascinated with
our daughter, Harshal and he said that he too had a small daughter. Perhaps
he was seeing a reflection of his daughter in Harshal. One of them shared
about his family and was excited to know that Shikha is from Faridabad,
which is just next to his own home in Badarpur.

NEEV is about developing small scale industries and small scale
entrepreneurs. Small because when anything becomes big, it loses the human
face, humans start losing dignity, impersonal brands become more important
than the human face and the human art. With NEEV Herbal Handmade Soaps we
are trying to introduce a concept of a different kind of business - in which
there is not a mere exchange of materials but of the stories of the human
spirit and human dignity.

Dear Anurag
thanx for sharing your experiances and it definitely makes our lives
richer and atleast for sometime takes us in the meditating mode...
away from the mundane.
I can completely understand the looks that you are talking about, from
both the sides. It was when I had my first exhibitition at a
supposidly 5 star hotel. The gallery is actually the corridor from
where people pass to go to meeting halls/restaurant and rooms.  People
just kept passing by with their faces looking down or talking on the
phone or looked at paintings that were in their line of sight while
walking but never stopped to look at other paintings. While we with
expectant eyes got alerted with every passer hoping that he would
atleast look at the paintings not expecting him to buy or even
appreciate. Trying to act toatlly inexsistent or in conversation
amongst ourselves (we were 2-3 artists) so that it doesnt pressurize
them into anything, trying to disperse thinking that 3 people's
presence might be intimidating. Looking at our own paintings as
observers so that they dont feel out of place.
I realized how much the words of appreciation mean (or any critical
remarks too) to an artist and so many times we just pass without
expressing our likings even when we really appreciate the paintings.
But I wont term them as bad souls. They are just ignorant people.
When you are stitting at a counter, you are at more vulnerable
position. Because you are now part of the fraternity, a lot of whom
tell stories and lies to lure the customers and sell them their
products somehow. Everybody has experianced that I now they start
giving those ignorant eyes when they pass something that doesnt catch
their fancy. This is where the ignorance comes into picture.  They
dont know what is for their benefit. Another thing that might block is
the fact that we all have the perception that anything herbal/organic/
environmental friendly etc comes at a price, its costlier... and we
dont know that the benefits outweigh the costs...
Your role here is more to educate the consumer. May be distribute just
fliers with information to make them aware, not at the counter alone
but away from it so that they dont feel the obligation to buy. Some of
friends who have exhibited at fairs say that they dont really sell
much there but they get future customers. You are basically making
people aware of your presence.
A soap is not something that you buy and use it once. If you are
interested you would want to use it always else it doesnt makes sense.
So it should be convenient for them to keep buying it whenever they
want it. So its a long term relationship that you want to establish
here and just at the counter.
Most of the people would not be inetersted in environmental friendly
products if they come at a cost to them - inconvenience or price. They
would be if the alternatives (chemicals) are harmful to them. And if
its a subtle effect than again the convenience outweighs everything
else. So it is a difficult job that you have here.

just throwing in few thoughts that crossed my mind while reading and
writing this mail.
