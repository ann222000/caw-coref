The dark and ominous clouds of reservation of jobs for sc/st's are
hovering over the Indian private sector. It is hardly surprising in a
society where the constitution was born in the dark, murky cesspool of
socialism. The pesky politicians who hummed like irritating mosquitoes
are beginning to getting louder and the industrialists who thought
that voluntary affirmative action would satisfy them are beginning to
see the inevitable and those who still can't are in for a nasty
surprise. All the exuberance of post 91 liberalization is starting to
look like pre-id fattening of the private sector bakra with the owners
(politicians) licking their fangs with gleeful anticipation.
In a society with no intellectual guidance it not surprising that
their is little understanding of the role the government and the
political system is based on statist tyranny no matter which party is
in power. The rights of individuals are a concept totally alien and
the good is that which is good for society and its rulers are here to
tell us what that is exactly.
"The source of man's rights is not divine law or congressional law,
but the law of identity. Rights are conditions of existence required
by man's nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth,
it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own
free judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the
product of his work. If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right
live as a rational being: nature forbids him the irrational." (Atlas
Shrugged)

In describing the nature of government Rand said "A society that robs
an individuals of the product of his effort, or enslaves him, or
attempts to limit the freedom of his mind, or compels him to act
against his own rational judgment is not, strictly speaking, a
society, but a mob held together by institutionalized gang rule. In a
free society, men are not forced to deal with one another. They do so
only by voluntary agreement and, when a time element is involved, by
contract. If a contract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man
then it leads to one of the most important and the most complex
functions of the government: to the function of an arbiter who settles
disputes among men according to objective laws.
The proper functions of a government fall into three broad categories,
all of them involving the issues of physical force and the protection
of men's rights: the police, to protect men from criminals- the armed
forces, to protect men from foreign invaders- the law courts, to
settle disputes among men according to objective laws. All three
categories involve the principle that the purpose of law and of
government is the protection of individual rights."
Right now Indian society due to it's intellectual vacuum is standing
on brink of an abyss- staring into a whirlpool of chaos, confusion and
a long struggle. The only question is when the quotas are going to be
implemented (probably next 2-3 years).  Makes me shudder and brings
back memories of the times when pre 91 i had to go and stand at the
govt. office for 3 days at times waiting for news of the quota of pig
iron for my fathers factory. The inspector raj we are going to see is
going to be far worse this time as the looters will have far more to
plunder. The reign of uncertainty and fear will further degrade
already non-objective laws. With the specter of quotas looming large,
the private businesses will have to rethink their strategies just to
survive.

"What distinguishes government from all other organizations is its
assumed right to initiate the use of force against it citizens to
expropriate their property for its own support. A voluntarily
supported government is a contradiction in terms"
........Regi Firehammer

"In a free society government exists to prevent violence, theft, and
fraud," is what most libertarians and objectivists believe. (By
violence, they mean the initiation or threat of physical force.) What
all of these sincere freedom lovers do not understand is that
government is the one and only agency that is a threat to freedom and
no government is able to prevent violence, theft, or fraud. All that
any government is able to do is to come in after the fact, after the
woman has been raped, after the house has been burglarized, or after
the elderly person has lost all their money to the con artist and
attempt to discover and prosecute the perpetrator (which does the
victim no good at all).

There are a lot of measures which can be taken to prevent violence and
other crimes. The difference between America and India show us that.
Why is the crime rate lower in US? obviously because of certain
measures taken by the govt. which creates safer environment. I don't
want a policeman to protect me at all times, what i want is the means
to protect myself like access to guns. That at least evens the odds
somewhat. Intelligence agencies at both local and national level can
keep the crime levels in check. As for the economic crimes the right
laws which freely allow people to enter into contracts and the laws to
enforce contracts prevent most crimes from taking place. It's only
when there is a failure of the govt. to have objective laws in place
and lame judiciary like in India where people die of old age before
their cases are decided encourage criminals to do as they please. And
in case of police and courts acting swiftly in case of a crime taking
place definitely prevents others from taking place easily.
"Ayn Rand blames the failure of America's government in this regard to
flaws in the Constitution. The flaw is the constitution, and the
mystic belief in the magic that makes a document written by a few men,
and signed by them, binding on many men who not only did not sign it,
but never even saw or heard of it.)"

It is ridiculous to accuse Rand of mysticism. Does the guy expect that
constitution be written by everybody? Or should it be rejected cause
of a homeless bum who did not hear about it?
The guy quotes Rand and takes the part where she says that if the
govt. is not run on objective principles it will do exact opposite of
what it should and claims that's how it will always be. He does not
give reasons as to why the ideal scenario presented by rand is not
possible. He does not give his alternative to the governments.

"You believe there are two many dishonest, incompetent, unproductive,
sick, and unreasonable people for us to handle, so we need a
government."

Even in the ideal scenario of all the rational, honest... people
getting together (like in atlas shrugged ending) you would want
certain rules and laws governing their interactions amongst themselves
both economic and otherwise.
