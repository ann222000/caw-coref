Hi! Can anyone help me? I would like to know how I get my blog placed
as a link on someone elses website or blog, do I have to approach
them? Also, is it ok to post images from magazines, web etc if they
are credited or is there some copywright thing I have to do? Any

You can comment or email the blog owner. I do get requests like these
and often turned them down unfortunately. But if you have informative
or helpful content, some may even link you without you asking. Eg,
this blogger even made a button to link to my blog without me asking
(link below). I made a post because someone asked for help for smiley
images and I got a site for him/her where they say those who use their
images are not obliged to, but linking to their site will be highly
appreciated. So I decided to make a post plus show how people can link
sites at

http://bloggerfordummies.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-you-can-help-blogge...

and also say readers are not obliged but linking will be appreciated.
BTW will welcome feedback from you guys what is your reaction when you
get a message like this. Do you feel offended or something similar, or
feel the person asking for the link is too much

I get lots of requests for help in comments in my blogs plus email and
sometimes add a signature line like

(no one should feel obligated. Everthing completely voluntary.
However, by doing so, you may also help your visitors find helpful
information and help. You may even pick up various ways of linking
sites there too)

and then leave readers to decide for themself without persuasions.

BTW I am getting too many requests for help to the extend I find it
difficult to manage my own blogs plus other tasks and now weighting
getting an autoresponder to tell them I cannot cope and suggests ways
they can find posts in my blogs that can help them, and maybe answer
some when I have the time. Note I have 2 sitesearch boxes in some of
my blogs that can search multiple sites, 1 at the top, and one in the
footer, Plus I keep the navbar because there is a &quot;Search blog&quot; box
there. And I have Label Lists where they  can try to find relevant
posts.

Like Enviroman said just email or ask in the comments section of the
blog so that the blog owner will get the message.

There is also a thing known as a &quot;blogroll&quot; where a link to your blog
is added that way.  Someone could happen upon your blog, like your
content and add you to their blogroll.

Basically the rules of copyright infringement say that you cannot put
copyrighted material -and that includes images - if you don't have
permission from the copyrighted owner.  Now of course people still do
this kind of thing but even so its better to be safe then sorry!  You
could always email the copyright owner and ask their permission.

Perez Hilton has a very popular celebrity gossip blog but he's been
having trouble because he posts celebrity pictures of which  it is
disputed whether or not he has the right to add them to his blog.

So I repeat - It's better to be safe than sorry!
