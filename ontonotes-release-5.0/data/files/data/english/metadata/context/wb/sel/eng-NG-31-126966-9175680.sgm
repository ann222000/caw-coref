Study: 96-Percent of Boston Sports Fans Have No Idea How Annoying They Are
According to a study set to be released today by the Center for Sports
Research, a whopping 96-percent of Boston sports fans have no idea how
unbelievably annoying they are to those who are not supporters of the Red
Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins.

&quot;It's amazing. The vast majority of these people actually think that they
behave just as any other fans do, and that people who have a problem with
them are simply jealous,&quot; said the study's director, Dr. Michael Kreager, a
Princeton sociologist. &quot;When in fact, almost all Boston fans have become
obnoxious Massholes of the highest order.&quot;

Due to an overwhelming inferiority complex stemming from decades of playing
second fiddle to New York, the study found that Boston fans are woefully
lacking in knowledge of how to respectfully conduct themselves when one of
their teams actually wins. But worse, they revel in their boorish behavior
and seem to find more enjoyment in flaunting their good fortune in the faces
of others than they do in sincerely celebrating and relishing their teams'
achievements.

&quot;The media has only contributed to this problem,&quot; said Dr. Kreager. &quot;By
harping on the years and years the Red Sox went without a championship as
though it was some sort of national tragedy, Boston fans actually started to
believe they were more important than fans from other cities and therefore
deserved to win more. When in fact, all they were was fans of a crappy
franchise.&quot;

And when the Red Sox finally won last year - on the heels of two Patriots
championships that were then followed by another in February - it created a
vicious cocktail that made even the most subdued and casual Boston sports
fan into an obnoxious, drunken meathead, unbearably annoying to anyone with
different rooting interests.

&quot;I wanted to be happy for these people when the Patriots won, and especially
when the Red Sox finally got a World Series, but I found it impossible,&quot;
said Dan Miller, a Seattle native who now lives outside Boston. &quot;Before I
could even congratulate any of my friends or acquaintances they got up in my
face, yelling and screaming and saying how my favorite teams suck, or
leaving messages on my cell phone gloating about it. So instead of being a
mild supporter of Boston teams, now I hate them with every fiber of my
being. Same with most of their fans.&quot;

The study also found that some 89 percent of Boston fans believe they are
the most knowledgeable fan base in the world, when in reality they are no
more savvy than any other.

&quot;We found this to be most evident in relation to the Patriots,&quot; said Dr.
Kreager. &quot;Until they made the Super Bowl in 1997, most New Englanders barely
paid attention to football, but now - thanks to the Patriots winning three
of the past four years - they seem to believe they invented the game or
something and that their city is the epitome of all things football. Of
course, once the Patriots inevitably start struggling some day, we expect
most of their fans to ignore them again.&quot;

The only saving grace for Boston fans - or perhaps more for people who come
into regular contact with them - is that the Celtics and Bruins continue to
suck. But even in mediocrity, the Masshole-ishness finds a way to shine
through.

&quot;I personally found it hilarious that the Celtics managed to squeak into the
playoffs this year and lots of Boston fans actually thought they had a
legitimate shot of going to the Finals,&quot; said Dr. Kreager. &quot;Right, with Paul
Pierce, Antoine Walker and Ricky Davis - not to mention Danny Ainge in the
front office - you're really a force to be reckoned with. And, of course,
now that the Celtics draft has received high marks, they're all guaranteeing
a few championships by the end of the decade. I usually try to step back and
stay completely objective when I'm studying a group of people, but I have to
say - these people are freaking morons. Absolutely unbearable.&quot;

Predictably, the ever-belligerent and cantankerous Boston fans do not agree
with the study's findings.

&quot;That is wicked stupid. People are just jealous. What - did some Yankees fan
make up that study? Probably, 'cause the Yankees suck!&quot; said Tommy Reilly, a
27-year old Boston bartender. &quot;Yeah, that's right. You heard me. The Yankees
suck!&quot;

If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to make some sort of
point there, ye who scrubs the privy.

Yes, I'll fess up, guilty. Keeping mind that I'm a Vahmontah, not a
Masshole. BTW, even most New Englanders feel the same way about
Massholes. It used to be that the Sawx sucked and the Pats sucked and it
was the Celtics that brought home the brass, stolen out of the hands of
the likes of the Lakers. The Bruins had their hay-day too. Trust me, it
will wind back around and it'll be back to loserville again and we'll go
back to shovelling our driveways again.

But ya know, the trash talk, the obnoxiousness and all that is most of
the fun of it.

I was really hoping to open the newspaper this morning and read that the
whole Boston team died in a fiery plane crash on their way home from Denver.

It didn't happen so I must bestow my standard Sicilian curse on them,

&quot; May their Mothers all die from Cancer of the Cunt&quot;!
