&gt; &gt; Bob,

&gt; &gt; Could you remind me of the circumstances involving your harmonica
&gt; &gt; recording?  It's a busking situtaion, right?  Subway station?

&gt; Yes.

I really like this music.  The performances are obviously sincere; the
performers like to perform and are quite experienced, especially the
singer/harmonica player.  As to the sound, it seems like you did a good
job of keeping the crowd noise to a minimum.  I like the sound of the
voice far better than harmonica.  To me, the harmonica often sounds
stuffy and sometimes too hot (overloaded).  The fadeout on one of the
early tracks is interesting.... longer than is usually heard, I think.
Not bad, just different.  I HATE the sound that the guitarist is
getting.  It's probably a tiny, Pignose type of amp.  If that's true,
you probably captured it accurately!  It's hard to busk with an amp that
lets electric guitar do its thing, for sure.  I think that the balance
is good.  Once in a while the voice is pushed a little hard like the
harmonica.

More later today...

Excellent! You will find harmonica therapy is the perfect balm for r.a.o.
inflicted wounds.

Do you feel that one or more of the songs goes on too long, or that any
particular selection doesn't fit with the others? I would like to protect
the artist from being overly self critical, but I am not qualified to do it.

The guitar amp is one of those tiny things. The harmonica player would like
him to ditch it, but the guitarist is in love with the heavy fuzz.

The harmonica player's voice gets the smoker effect from his amp. He's
afraid to show his voice without it, but his voice is, actually, quite
pleasant in a classic crooner way.

The harmonica player cups his hand around the harmonica, and uses an SM-57.

There were four channels: a stereo XY mike feed, using a Rode NT-4, a direct
feed from the harmonica player's mike via a mike splitter, and a guitar
pickup. I used the pickup feed to restore some of the brilliance trashed by
the Pignose.

Tracks 1-8 and 9-16 were mixed differently. Tracks 1-8 have more XY stereo
9-16 have more spot. Please let me know if you have any preference for one
mix over the other. It would help me understand better your remark about the
harmonica. Your objection could be due to the player's amp, the effects he
used, or something about his miking technique.

The Pignose sound is just SO bad, IMO.  As are the effects on the
harmonica.  IMO, they would be much better off using a clean amp sound
and straight harmonica (with maybe just a hint of reverb, though it's
probably not needed in a subway station).  They need an amp like this:

Your preference suggests that the amps, and the effects they provide, not
the mikes, are the primary source of your displeasure. Of course, if you
heard the mikes separately, you might have additional observations.

As a layman, I would benefit if you could give me some insight into your
dislike of Track 9. My personal dislike is with another track. For reasons
not understood by me, the harmonica player deleted four of  tracks from from
his final compilation, but  kept both track 9 and the one I dislike.  And
you didn't find one track that didn't fit thematically with the others? It
didn't bother me, but he is hypercritical.

The harmonica is  naturally intimate.  It fits in the pocket, traditionally
the instrument of wanderers and hoboes, warbling by a campfire into the
quiet darkness. I'll bet you've heard a lot more harmonica music than I
have, and are offended by  transformation to the proportions of a cathedral
organ. In his defense, the player is a small man, struggling for the
attention of disinterested masses of humanity in transit. He is trying to
scratch his mark in the hard bluestone of a public concourse.
