Hi,

POSCO has a requirement to use kandadhar mines. Mr. Jual Oram is leading an
agitation where he wants no mining in Kandadhar. I appreciate his thoughts,
that we should ensure that the waterfall in Kandadhar is not destroyed, But,
I think It would make sense if POSCO comes up with an innovative idea on how
to use the mines while retaining Kandadhar as a big tourist destination.

Perhaps, members care to point out certain thoughts on this issue....

Dear all:

In my opinion, there are much larger issues than saving the water fall. e.g.
Amending  MOUs for protecting state and people's interest.

Mr. Jual Oram is not raising those issues and concentrating in this
comparative smaller issue.

The same can be taken up with the ministry of tourism of GOO to develop that
as a tourist spot and leave it. However, if the whole hill is full of Ore,
digging those might damage the waterfall.

To me selling Iron Ore /ton at Rs. 27/- and damaging ecology is not worth.
Plus SEZ TAx losses . It is like Liquior Tax earning of 100+ crores is
useless ; better to stop selling of liquor there by saving lot of health
care expenses.

Either we sell Ore at a reasonable price or don't sell at all.

Thanks
Manoj padhi

Dear Manjo ji

Though Australia has much more iron ore and coal, it's economy is thriving
on Tourism. There are many lessons to learn from them how to save our flora
and fauna. Why we are talking of Kandadhar alone. There are many other
places of tourist attraction but who bothers since those tourists are not a
lobby or big industrilists who can buy favours and influence the decision
makers.

The news is that even TATAs are also in dispute with POSCO over some of the
mining area which POSCO claims to be theirs where as TATAs claim that they
are reserved for them.

Those who see Naveen Babu as the neat and clean politicial personality needs
to review their thoughts and understand the ground reality.

Those who feel that the loot of natural resources of the state is due to the
central government's faulty policies are also living in day dreams. Even the
new decision of the Group of Ministers that has prepared a new mining policy
needs the approval of the state authorities. Why the state authorities
surrender to the dictates of the central governement to allot mining rights
for a paltry sum of money and people of the state are not only deprived of
the natural resources but also lose beautyful natural sites like Kandadhar.

About alternatives, the most serious issue that the mining department of the
state should consider is that why they allow open cast mining that destroys
hills and Flora and Fauna. Why not follow the underground mining. Since it
requires more protection and more costs, greedy mining companies manage to
bribe the authorities who permit open cast mining, which is causing huge
ecological disbalance.

Alternative is not Naveen Babu or any other Babu but awareness amongst the
people that for a paltry sum of Rs. 27/- we will not allow our resources
worth billions to be looted like this. But those blue eyed boys of Naveen
Babu may think as anti development forces. God bless them.

Pravin jee and et al,

Everyone who is blaming Naveen Patnaik for the poor Iron ore rate
should understand one thing clearly. The Iron-ore royalty is fixed by
Central Govt. It has been a long standing demand of mineral rich states to
change the system to ad-valorem.

As Manoj babu would say, that the above opinion is that of  BJD cadre...But,
I would challenge anybody to disprove the above facts....

The currnet mineral policy recomendation is 7.5%. I dont disagree on tourism
though. Orissa is a beautiful state. It's tourism potential is largely
unexplored. I think we have great potential to earn serious revenue
there....

Beyond that, I must also add that I realise I'm wasting my time trying to
convince people who have their own agendas. Anyhow, This mail is just for
information of people who are not aware..

Umashankar Das

Umashankar babu,

Bother central &amp; state Governments are responsible for the mining loot plus
SEZ to mining sector.

I  consider &quot;No alternative to Naveen&quot; and &quot;Inefficiency of Present
Government&quot; - two different things. You will not understand unless you
imagine yourself as a &quot;M/s MCL - Land Loser,who lost his land and struggling
or bribing for a contract job&quot;. For many of you that is acceptable and for
me not. I have spent 12 years in village and have seen 'How poors survive
with 'Pakhala &amp; Sukhua poda'. if any CM is not safe guarding their futures
and following orders from Ratan tata &amp; POSCO - I hate that CM - You name it
personal agenda or not. Now I understand that in Kalinga Nagar - Naveen was
following orders from Ratan Tata as he followed in Belpahar Case. I noticed
that all are silent - I failed to understand whether that is also acceptable
to them or not.

Naveen is doing some thing and hence Jibanendra babu given 2/10. I also
given 2/10 (3 years of Naveen Patnaik's 2nd term : let us review its
performance - By Manoj
Padhi&lt; http://hindtoday.com/Blogs/ViewBlogs.aspx?HTAdvtId=543&amp;HTAdvtPlaceCod...; &gt;
).

I was talking about POSCO  officials refusal to buy Ores at international
price and telling that they are here because of dead cheap Ore price. Now we
have many steel plants lined up and GOO shouldn't succumbed to pressure.

If China is not selling its Ore reserve at same price, why GOO is selling at
throw away price.
Manmohan &amp; Naveen both support every Industrialist. It is election money
which is driving policy. Ratan Tata is chairman of investment commission.
What else we can expect.

I remember one proverb &quot;Chor O Daku Bhai Bhai&quot;; Center is Daku and GOO is
Chor. Both need money for election and hence gift minerals.

Praveen ji might answer in depth.

Thanks
Manoj

Umashankar babu,

Thanks.

You are a positive analyst and often ignore vital inefficiencies of GOO.
What you see as positive, I consider that a routine job. I am seeing how
Government machineries/COPs works in USA. Hence I am able to see the
difference.

e.g. Delhi Government was sleeping for blue line buses for last 4 years;
COPs were aware of all the issues and were silent due to monthly commission.
Where as in One day raid they ceased  hundreds of buses.

You will consider this as a minor lapse. In US, every day COPs follow rules
and catch people. For you Shiela Dixit's sudden wake up is acceptable where
as for me &quot; I will look at what she was doing all these 4 years&quot;.

My scanner works like this. I know you don't like these kind of scanner;
Please bear with me like many others are bearing with (as per you).

For the same reason, for you and Digambara babu non-acknowledgment of
letters acceptable. For me also acceptable if I read a news that Naveen
implemented our suggestions. I don't see any news.

Where is the tender transparency which Naveen declared 2 years back in floor
of the house.If you see that link please forward that to group.

Is TRL Belpahar closed as promised in floor of Assembly ? It was supposed to
be closed by July-5th.Please let our readers know if you see that news.

You don't consider these as lie. I do.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

&gt; &gt; I  consider &quot;No alternative to Naveen&quot; and &quot;Inefficiency of Present
&gt; &gt; Government&quot; - two different things. You will not understand unless you
&gt; &gt; imagine yourself as a &quot;M/s MCL - Land Loser,who lost his land and struggling
&gt; &gt; or bribing for a contract job&quot;. For many of you that is acceptable and for
&gt; &gt; me not. I have spent 12 years in village and have seen 'How poors survive
&gt; &gt; with 'Pakhala &amp; Sukhua poda'. if any CM is not safe guarding their futures
&gt; &gt; and following orders from Ratan tata &amp; POSCO - I hate that CM - You name it
&gt; &gt; personal agenda or not. Now I understand that in Kalinga Nagar - Naveen was
&gt; &gt; following orders from Ratan Tata as he followed in Belpahar Case. I noticed
&gt; &gt; that all are silent - I failed to understand whether that is also acceptable
&gt; &gt; to them or not.

&gt; &gt; Naveen is doing some thing and hence Jibanendra babu given 2/10. I also
&gt; &gt; given 2/10 ( 3 years of Naveen Patnaik's 2nd term : let us review its
&gt; &gt; performance - By Manoj Padhi
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://hindtoday.com/Blogs/ViewBlogs.aspx?HTAdvtId=543&amp;HTAdvtPlaceCod...; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ).

&gt; &gt; I was talking about POSCO  officials refusal to buy Ores at
&gt; &gt; international price and telling that they are here because of dead cheap Ore
&gt; &gt; price. Now we have many steel plants lined up and GOO shouldn't succumbed to
&gt; &gt; pressure.

&gt; &gt; If China is not selling its Ore reserve at same price, why GOO is
&gt; &gt; selling at throw away price.
&gt; &gt; Manmohan &amp; Naveen both support every Industrialist. It is election money
&gt; &gt; which is driving policy. Ratan Tata is chairman of investment commission.
&gt; &gt; What else we can expect.

&gt; &gt; I remember one proverb &quot;Chor O Daku Bhai Bhai&quot;; Center is Daku and GOO
&gt; &gt; is Chor. Both need money for election and hence gift minerals.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As Manoj babu would say, that the above opinion is that of  BJD

&gt; &gt; &gt; The currnet mineral policy recomendation is 7.5%. I dont disagree on

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Manjo ji

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though Australia has much more iron ore and coal, it's economy is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thriving on Tourism. There are many lessons to learn from them how to save
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our flora and fauna. Why we are talking of Kandadhar alone. There are many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other places of tourist attraction but who bothers since those tourists are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a lobby or big industrilists who can buy favours and influence the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision makers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The news is that even TATAs are also in dispute with POSCO over some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mining area which POSCO claims to be theirs where as TATAs claim that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are reserved for them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those who see Naveen Babu as the neat and clean politicial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality needs to review their thoughts and understand the ground
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those who feel that the loot of natural resources of the state is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due to the central government's faulty policies are also living in day
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dreams. Even the new decision of the Group of Ministers that has prepared a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new mining policy needs the approval of the state authorities. Why the state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; authorities surrender to the dictates of the central governement to allot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mining rights for a paltry sum of money and people of the state are not only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deprived of the natural resources but also lose beautyful natural sites like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kandadhar.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; About alternatives, the most serious issue that the mining
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; department of the state should consider is that why they allow open cast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mining that destroys hills and Flora and Fauna. Why not follow the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; underground mining. Since it requires more protection and more costs, greedy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mining companies manage to bribe the authorities who permit open cast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mining, which is causing huge ecological disbalance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alternative is not Naveen Babu or any other Babu but awareness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amongst the people that for a paltry sum of Rs. 27/- we will not allow our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resources worth billions to be looted like this. But those blue eyed boys of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Naveen Babu may think as anti development forces. God bless them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me selling Iron Ore /ton at Rs. 27/- and damaging ecology is

Dear Umashankar Babu,
I like the issue raised by you. I hope they will not venture
destroying the water fall. Being a man
from that area,I know local people have lot of attachment to
Khandadhar water fall. From a
distance it looks like the edge of a white sword and that is how the
name Khanda(sword) and
Dhar(sharp edge of sword) =Khandadhar has been derived.
yours,
ncsahoo

Dear Manoj ji

You have invited me to give a detailed reply. Here it goes.

The question that should arise in any body's mind is why the people of not
only Orissa but also of other adjoining tribal dominated states Jharkhand
and Chhattisgarh are so poor despite the re are abundant reserves of natural
wealth in shape of forests and Minerals in the tribal areas of our
country. No body should ignore the hard facts that there are serious
mistakes.

No body should deny that the primary duty of the state actors is to ensure
that the people of the state are living in peace and prosperity. For this
the three states under discussion have huge natural wealth that can be best
used for all round development of the state and its people. I have stated
earlier on also that with proper management of the natural resources, Orissa
can become the zero tax state.

But what happens in reality is quite contrast. State governments are
showering huge sops in the name of inviting investments. Key component of
the MOU is to allow mining rights of the natural wealth and exploitation of
natural water bodies for industrial purposes. Providing employment and
conditions for periphery development are imposed to lure the people or are
lolly pop gimmicks. I can site enough examples of blunt violations of the
vital terms of MOU but the state and its authorities have turned their blind
eyes despite drawing their attentions time and again.

No body should think by throwing the blame on the central government for a
laughable low rate of Royalty that is earned by the states. The key factors
that are in the control of the state are so vital that without the support
of the state not a single gram of mineral can be mined.

Most of the mining areas are in *Schedule V area,* where by the virtue of
Constitutional provisions, tribals enjoys full protection to their property
rights. Moreover, it is mandatory to obtain the positive resolve of tribals
duly passed in *&quot;JAN SUNWAI *[Public hearing] at a village council for any
decision to be taken be it acquisition of land or any statutory permission
including the vital environment clearances. Those who transfer the blame on
central government should understand that the district authorities of the
state are fully empowered to conduct and monitor such gram sabhas. It is
our experience so far that mostly the Gram Sabhas are held under the
fortified conditions where instead of *&quot;JAN SUNWAI&quot; *[Public hearing] it is
*&quot;GUN SUNWAI&quot;* , with extraordinary show of strength of the armed forces and
top administrative officials who are bent upon to any how manage the resolve
of the tribals despite their strong anger and protest. Even firing of live
bullets upon them is also not new. How can one transfer the blame of all
such police aided atrocities of the state committed on innocent poor tribals
to fulfill the interest of a mining contractor or we should name them as
Mining Mafias?

*We should not ignore the effects once the mining activities starts.   *The
habitats of the area are forcibly displaced even at the cost of bloodshed
and intruding in to their fundamental rights. State authorities by   bulldozing
rights of the people, buys law and order problem even at the cost of  losses
of Flora, Fauna and the hills. Reduced forest cover invites global warming,
air and water pollution is the gift to the people living in the vicinity of
those activities. Reduced forest cover, polluted atmosphere and water crisis
results in considerable economic losses in the field of Agriculture,
Horticulture and fishery. On the contrary, a handful few accumulates huge
wealth within no time, millions are left on their own.
**
*What is wrong ?*

The main reason for such disparity and causing crisis to millions for the
benefit of handful few is the result of the wrongly cultivated policies both
of the state and central government, that blindly favors the investors and
have no place or respect for the millions who are the worst sufferers.

*The main reason is that without doing proper homework, *wrong demands of
the investors are blindly accepted. This happens only in our country.
Royalties on the natural wealth is kept at laughable low rates, not by
ignorance but with the full knowledge of the authorities. They also know
very well that what they are doing is an insult to millions to fill the
coffers of an individual and share the booty. How can it be believed that
those officials who are in key posts do not know what are the international
situation and what they are doing is a big sin on the interest of the state
and its people. The real intentions of the authorities to turn blind eyes on
the international scenario can be imagined in a country which is labelled as
the most corrupt country.

*As we are discussing Iron Ore, I take it here for discussion purpose.
Situation in Bauxite is even worst.  *

India is the seventh largest producer of the Iron Ore in the world. We
were mining only 5 [five] Crore Ton of Iron before five years, which has now
crossed much over 14 [fourteen] Crore Ton by the end of year 2005. With many
more MOUs inked and new mines opened up, this figure is going to jump
considerably.

Due to huge demand of Steel all over the world, the rate of Iron Ore which
was about $ 25 before four years, has reached to US $ 86.7. [June close
precise rates ]Industry sources indicate that they should not be surprised
if the rate crosses US $ 100 in near future. What the tribal states of
Chhattigarh, Jharkhand and Orissa gets in return as Royalty is much much
less than even US $ 1. (ONE)

O.K. Automatically question arises why despite of such huge disparity
between International rates of minerals and the Royalties, it is surprising
that state governments of these three tribal states are working overtime to
dance to the tunes of the industrialists to ink MOU and allow them a free
hand. Why can't they make a pool to make a bargaining power. Why they do not
understand that they are not the owners of the huge natural wealth but are
custodian only that too for only five years and not for long 30 or 50 years
for which they grant permissions. Here is the role of the opposition
political party but here* &quot;Chor Chor Mausere Bhai&quot;* reigns supreme on
the rights of the people and forget that they are duty bound to do the
welfare of the people of the state.

*The hard facts :           *The high powered Deng Committee of Ministry of
Steel and Mines, Government of India has warned that if the present trend of
blind exploitation and export of Iron Ore continues,   there will be no more
Iron Ore left with us within next fifty years. Shri R.K. Deng has also
warned that  we shall be deep financial crisis once the Iron Ore deposits in
our country are exhausted. There is no doubt that Steel price in our country
will be too high, the closure of many steel units will be a very costly
affair to manage. It will be too costly for our country to face the likely
dangerous situation and too difficult to manage our economy with huge
population to support.

* *

*How can it be believed that our state authorities do not know that iron ore
rich nations like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, USA and China do not export any iron
ore while India exported over 90 million tones annually. &quot;Exports are
growing up at a annual rate of 15% depleting our meager ore reserves at an
alarming pace.&quot; *

Even the Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) has sought Prime Minister's
intervention to stop the continuing export of iron-ore, failing which the
growth of steel industry would be seriously jeopardized. *&quot;It is clear that
by encouraging export of iron-ore and throttling of steel exports, we are
transferring India's competitive advantage to China, Korea and Japan. In the
process we are going back to a colonial economy- becoming a mere supplier of
raw material and importer of finished product.&quot;  * ISA President Moosa Raza
wrote to the PM Manmohan Singh.

Per capita iron ore reserves of India with two major iron ore producing
countries, viz. Australia and Brazil, is negligible. *India's per capita
iron ore reserves is only 12 KG as against 333 Kg for Brazil and 1,999 Kg
for Australia.* In this reserve, only Hematite has been taken for India,

J. Mehera, Director, Essar group warned, *&quot;Indian steel industry's only
advantage vis-à-vis its international competitors is the high quality of
Indian iron-ore. This compensates for high costs of energy, coking coal,
interest rates and other financial costs. In such a situation, losing the
only advantage by allowing free exports of iron-ore will go against Indian
interests and is as good as giving your competitors a walk over. The only
way to preserve India's long term financial interest is to put a blanket ban
on export of iron-ore,&quot; *

*All this happens in the name of development where key word to lure is lolly
pop in shape of Employment; while   protests of the people are criticized as
anti developmental forces. I do not quote the figures right now but give an
example of NEELANCHAL, JINDAL, BHUSHAN STEEL, NEEPAJ STEEL, ORISSA CEMENT
LTD, etc. Those who proudly champion to shield the mischiefs of the
state should visit the above companies to find that majority of the land
losers have been cheated by not providing them any employment. Let me also
refer to the TATAs Kalinga Nagar. What the government of Orissa assures in
the name of employment opportunities for the displaced there is not seen in
the statement of a senior TATA official given under an oath. Any comments! *
**
*Now the decision of the group of Ministers of Government of India, to
continue with the export of iron ore is seen as a move taken under the
pressure of the Investor lobby that are keen to export costly natural wealth
of our country to make more money for them compared to what it will
contribute to the development of the nation. Those who are happy to see that
ad valorem duty is proposed should also know very well that it is kept at a
very low rate where the disparity is not going

Pravin ji,

Thanks for spending your valuable time for writing this wonderful piece of
analysis.
You have written in very simple and easy to understand language that I hope
every body will understand - what is happening ? Looting in broad day light
and sharp rise in domestic iron price after approx. 50 years.

But since both central &amp; state governments are  mousera bhai  and sharing a
portion of loot - hardly we can do any thing.

I think this answers Shri Sandip Dasverma's article &quot;Why we can't sell Iron
Ores at Market Price. ?
(Reproduced from an earlier opinion by Shri Sandip Dasvarma)

It is really commendable that MPs from Orissa have stood up at long
last in the parliament on the IIT issue and made it an issue of it.
As we know the protest has not  yielded  any result, at least
immediately.  Center has gotten accustomed to a an acquiescing Orissa,
with little or no protest as much as a squeak.
My suggestion to them would be:  don't waste your energy in begging.
I was checking yesterday and found that 46.7 million tons of Iron Ore
have been raised last year from the mines of Orissa. If we could
charge the world market price to the buyers we would have earned:
($84.4-$10)*46.5 million =$3.5 billion $$. Where $10 is the raising
cost.
If we get this money where ever then GOO can have 15 - Rs. 1000 crore
IITs.  And  if we can collaborate with MPs of Jharkhand and 36 garh,
we will be in a position like OPEC countries to pay our way to
developed condition.

Now some one may ask me, how do we get this done?  This is money that
the mine licensee are minting - how does Govt of Orissa /36 Garh /
Jharkhand do it?  My answer is through OMC. Now even if the cost is
$15 due it's inefficient &amp; higher cost ways (not corrupt) the money
can be given back or donated to GOO prescribed causes and spent on the
mining areas for their development.  There will be enough, Rs.15000
crores earning for every cause in Orissa. If we get $60 as royalty -
there still will be $25 for mining and transportation. It is OK to
have the pit head steel plant but that they can be given the lisence
so the state gets it's $60 or 80% of world market price which ever is
greater. Posco/ Mittal or TATAs will still have 5% advantage over
others to locate in Orissa or 36 Garh or Jharkhand, considering there
is a 15% disadvantage of backward area(infrastructure).

Let the MPs do us a favor, demand and raise the Royalty to 80% of the
world Ore price(thus link it to the same permanently and GOO ensure
that there is no stealing of Ore from the mines as prevelant. And
Orissa will have money for everything and to spare. We need to spend
the money to make our 7,011 high schools were functioning in the
State(now 7800) Oriya medium High schools, 44,416 Primary Schools,
14.233 Upper Primary Schools,  comparable  to the English medium
schools or better like it was in 50s and 60s, when a Purusottampur
High School produced a topper in High School Certificate examination.

An educated citizenry can take care of themselves.
Best wishes,

Sandip

&gt; Dear Manoj ji

&gt; You have invited me to give a detailed reply. Here it goes.

&gt; The question that should arise in any body's mind is why the people of not

&gt; and Chhattisgarh are so poor despite the re are abundant reserves of
