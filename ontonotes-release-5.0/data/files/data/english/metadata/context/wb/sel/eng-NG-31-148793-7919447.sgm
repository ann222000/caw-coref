Following a question asked by Dr. Koehler, &quot;What can USF do to
differentiate itself from the other Universities,&quot; I propose the adoption
of Web 2.0 tools such as wikis and blogs.

Please see attached summary propopsal for an introduction to the concept.

Very Respecfully,
Manny Wilson

Good evening everyone,

Manny, thank you for getting the ball rolling.  This
has inspired me to begin discussing a thought I have
for Dr Koehler's challenge in order to try to hoist
the USF College of Business head and shoulders above
the competition.

Please see my attached proposal.

Dr Jermier and Dr Koehler, thank you for a stimulating
semester which inspired these ideas.

Best regards, Mark

Hi folks,
Koehler is great... wish I could have another class with him.

USF does have a study Abroad program - - it was funded by COBA, but
recently cut.  I thought they only lost their TA and offices, but I
notice now they don't have a website either.  Or I can't open it.

http://coba.usf.edu/cib the Center for International Business (CIB)
http://www.coba.usf.edu/student/IBB/index.html The student version
opens...
http://global.usf.edu/studyabroad/semester.html Fall and Spring
Semester Study Abroad Programs

It is still listed in the catalog though:
http://catalog.grad.usf.edu/currentpdf/USF_Graduate_Catalog_2006_2007...

It does not seem to be geared to Sustainability but the one
Sustainability Journal we do have almost got bought out by another
University too - - - since our new dean wont support it either..
http://www.coba.usf.edu/jermier/journal.htm

We do have Wiki and Blogs here as well. http://blog.usf.edu/ is
open for any student
Actually USF English department started some serious stuff with Wiki's
too..  Getting big grants for Learning communities and all...  though
most other colleges, Business included, just have no idea about it:
http://waw.taa.usf.edu/sites/waw/Joe_Moxley/moxley.aspx/ or they
started their own, like we should here too:
http://wiki.eng.usf.edu/index.php/Main_Page
http://wiki.fcit.usf.edu/wiki/ILTCE
http://netcluster.cse.usf.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
http://wiki.acomp.usf.edu/index.php/Main_Page

Interested enough I'm involved in the &quot;Sustainable Wiki&quot; here on
campus as well: http://web3.cas.usf.edu/main/centers/IISC/index.aspx

Our Wiki is also linked to a blog too: http://communiplexity.wikispaces.com/
course what I like is this http://communiplexity.wikispaces.com/WikiPoliSee
were we use propose to use a wiki to create public policy.  The Weekly
BrownBag meeting are open to anyone - - - Tuesday at 12:30 in FMHI
Westside D.

As with everything else I mentioned here Students just never hear
about these things - - - I think the new Dean is more worried about
his cash flow than the students anyway.  But proposing new methods and
speaking out about these things is the only way we can correct
anything.

Actually Proposing to Koehler is a great place to start too..  He was
the Dean for a while I think, worked in the USF Presidents and the FL
Governors offices as well..    So he's very good at proposing and
making changes...

I hope this information helps.  USF's website isn't too easy to find
things like this.  Course Moxley's work is all on his own site
anyway...  But I think it's great to propose changes, talking about
them and even better to start implementing them... If you think I can
help ask...

Take Care
eric

Thanks Eric, very helpful information. I had no idea the Univeristy had
wikis and blogs.

However, the University departments should not have their own wiki. If the
English department launched one, this should be expanded for use
University-wide. It would be much better to have one common University wiki
- otherwise it will be much less valuable and will not work or be used.

Eric,
Great to hear from you, man.

I am aware fo the study abroad program.  They do still have the following website, but it's a touch weak.

http://coba.usf.edu/programs/studyabroad/index.html

I guess I'm proposing more of a IBM track (International Business Management ro IBB or whatever) with a strong emphasis on sustainability.  This way students can spend half of their time abroad, rather than just for a short spell, and have some real hands on interenship experience.  I helped set up a similar program at my undergrad college.  Unfortunately I was a senior and didn't get a chance to participate.

http://dickinson.edu/global/programs/globally-integrated/index.htm
(San Salvador- Marine Science)

I understand the cash flow issues, and hope the grant possibilities I have will benefit the department.  Change is sometimes slow, and that can be ok, under some circumstances.

That journal looks like a fantastic tool.  Thank you for making me aware of it.  Great work!

How is everything with you?  We should try to have lunch again sometime soon.  Sorry I lost touch after last semester.  No excuse, just lazy and busy at the same time...
-Mark
