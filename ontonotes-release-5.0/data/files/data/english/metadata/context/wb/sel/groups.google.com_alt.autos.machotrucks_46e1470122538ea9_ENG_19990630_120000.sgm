"/> Uh.... you try pulling a triple axle fifth wheel trailer with a Nissan and then
come back and tell me who beats who.

Of course you're gonna beat a fullsize truck off the starting line... They
weigh about 3000 lbs more than your little truck. As for the S-10, I dunno
what to say, I never liked them anyway.

I ain't trying to prove nothing here... I never was.

"/> I would like to see a stock nissan p'up beat a v-8 powered silverado
off the line and down the road for that matter. Little tiny trucks
that are so small that you have to rub shoulders with the passenger
while riding in them are what really suck. Not to mention pushing
down on the gas pedal and trying to get moving with that little engine
up front, especially if you're under a load. I'd like to see what a
little truck looks like with a 1 ton payload in it's bed or a 3.5 ton
trailer attached to it. Just in case the original poster didn't
notice this forum is for macho trucks not matchbox trucks.

"/> You're probably right... I just assumed that because my aunt's '93 GrandAm with
a V-6 can beat the hell out of my '74 Chevy 3/4 ton. I guess a half ton with a
350 and a 4 barrel carburetor would be pretty fast off the line.

How many hamster wheels does that nissan truck have?

"/> I can't answer that one but my father in law does have a nissan
pickup. He's always complaining about how short on power it is and
about it's build quality. The sheet metal on it is awful thin, much
thinner than on my wifes 92 sentra. I do own a 99 silverado extended
cab with the ls1 based vortec 5.3/auto and I can waste a nissan truck
without even thinking twice. About a month ago a friend of ours who
has a 99 pathfinder thought he would try to stay with me while pulling
up onto the interstate. Needless to say I pulled away from him in a
hurry and got up into the traffic which was getting heavy. I sure
wouldn't want to try to merge into that without having enough power to
get out into it safely.

I have a factory service manual for the 1994 hardbody pickups and
Pathfinders. Complete, just like their techs use. Asking $40 or best
offer.
