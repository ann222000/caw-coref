Yeah the subject vehicle is OT,but I post this for those of you who
get a kick out of us tortured souls being victomized by mechanical
meyham. The object of my obsessive battle is the Check Engine Light
attached to the Ford pickup left to me by my deceased father. Dad
drove this thing for a couple of years with the CEL glowing brightly
in his daily travels.When the annoyance factor became too great,it was
hidden behind a cleverly placed hunk of electrical tape.WA-LAAA! Outta
sight,outta mind.
I ,on the other hand,prefer it to operate properly,not in the limp
home mode the computer reverts to when a hard code is locked in the
memory.The driveability and mileage suffer if the lights on.So I plug
in the trusty Snap-On scanner and unlock the hidden trouble
codes....Faulty downstream O2 sensor. Ok,off to the parts store for a
new one.By their computer,my truck is supposed to have 4 (!) O2
sensors,2 before the converter(upstream) and 2 after(downstream). Mine
only has 2,one in each exhaust manifold,ala'the prior years emission
package.Typical Ford,use up last years stuff on this years model.So I
buy 2 new sensors ($91.00@ pair)  and throw the truck on the hoist for
access. Damn lucky I had a hot wrench because the manifolds had to be
cherry red before the sensors would unthread. Install new,clear code
and cruise.Right?? NOT!!!
After a few miles,my  CEL is once again a glowing.Rescan the
computer memory,and the new magic code is &quot;low EGR flow.&quot; Wonderfull.
Silly me replaces the EGR ($54.00) and 1 questionable vacuum line to
it).Clear code and drive. Light is off for a good 8 miles driving.Shut
it off and let sit for 1/2 hour,then hop in to go.5.375 nimutes after
restarting my CEL is again illuminated.Now WTF??!!?? So this time I
throw it at a new ATC scanner  for comparison.Same &quot;lowflow&quot; code.So
after confiring with a late model service tech friend (who states they
see A LOT of EGR flow codes these days), I follow his advise and
remove new EGR valve and run a length of wire into intake plenium to
remove and carbon crud blockage.I also start it with the EGR supply
tube disconnected from the new EGR valve and tack it up to 5ooo RPM a
couple of times to hopefully blow out the pipe. Optimisticly,or
niavely,you choose,I reattach all the pieces and plumbing and drive it
around.The light remains mute,so I think I got it wipped.Drove all day
like that,and was starting to get happy.Then,just as the front tires
touched the driveway after work the CEL turns on AGAIN,and in my head
I hear the ECM laughing at me. Next morning I  remember a friend gave
me a Haynes manual. While mot as good as a MOTOR manual,its better
than nothing! So I follow the diagnastic flow chart,which leads me to
the &quot;exhaust gas regulator&quot;,which is a electromechanical solonoid that
regulates vacuum to the EGR. So I call my local FLAPS,and John tells
me he has the &quot;exhaust gas flow sensor&quot;,but not the solonoid.&quot;What?&quot; I
ask,this is the first I have heard of such an item.
So guessing since the EGR is new,it has a unfettered supply of
exhaust to it and all vacuum lines are 100%,the logical item is the
thing that regulates vacuum to the EGR. So we pay a visit to my
FLFD,and $51 bucks later,I have another shiney new part
underhood.Clear the trouble code and drive to work. About 2645 feet
from the parking light my old friend the CEL is lit up again!!! @#
%@*&amp;*#*&amp;!!!!!
So being of pissed mind and aggravated state,I hop on the net for a
Google of Ford EGR code issues.OMG!!! Quite the popular issue.Wish I
would have surfed first. So if I believe what I have read,I need the
&quot;flow sensor&quot;( for another $45 dollars). Aint technology grand??!!??
Hope to hell this cures the issue cause I am going batty.! Thanks for
letting me vent!!!...........Rich

I cannot offer any advice of value except to say that I live in the
believe that any vehicle with a &quot;Check Engine Light&quot; or a computer for
that matter shall never be found in my stable.

Computers belong on desks or on laps and I don't mean them thar' ladies

WA-LAAA? I love that. You're not Cajun, are you? This transforms the French
(well, Quebec French anyway)  low-key, throw-away expletive into something
almost Arabic. Sounds like the rebel yell (in French that's Rabelais) played
backwards. WaLAAA! The circuit-tracer's battle cry.

Studebaker had a sad venture into electronic ignition (some say no worse
than Chrysler's; others won't go that far), and then, if you don't count the
explosion-proof underwater wiring on the contract 6X6, that was it. Guys
who'll pore over a dwell meter for hours on a dual-point Prestolite are
mocking you for trusting to electrons. I don't approve, but I understand.

We are uneasy with stuff you can't tear down, file, spit on and start back
up. That's the difference between us and the Trusting Young. Having
static-timed an English motor cycle roadside using the cellophane from a
cigarette pack (according to the factory manual!), I'm hip. My under-30
mechanic, a whiz with diagnostic computers, says Mr. Goodwrench &amp; Co. use
codes to make sure only dealerships have the right programs, and I bet
there's something to that. I can't get past the idea that some of this
circuitry STILL isn't ready for prime-time and the elements, 30 years after
it came into use.

I have a 97 Aurora, and when the headlights came on and wouldn't go off it
cost over $600. It's not a &quot;switch,&quot; it's a &quot;sensor system.&quot; Now that car is
acting really right, but she's a bit long in the tooth. I can see the day
I'll have to get an even more electro-reliant s-box, and I'm scared to go
shopping. They light up! They talk! You can't get lost, can reserve a table
and call all the friends you wish you had! But what happens when it glides
to the side of the road? Call OnStar, I guess, if your subscription is paid
up, and they haven't changed satellites (don't laugh, it happened to Dad's
Caddy). What's going to happen in 20 years when people try to restore these
things?

Good on ya for staying with it to save your dad's truck. When you publish
your manual for wiring around all this crap and just making it run, I'll buy
a copy.

Try simply disconnecting the battery for an hour to clear the computer.
I had my F88d &quot;check engine&quot; light come on because of a nearly plugged air
filter.  Changed the filter and the light didn't go out.  Disconnected the
battery for a half an hour and the light was out and all was well.

Check engine lights on F**ds are designed to come on 2 days after the
warranty expires.

It's the best thing to ever happen to F**d dealers' service
departments!

We drove What's Her Face's Navigator with that stupid light on for the
biggest part of 3 years.  Sometimes, it would reset itself, sometimes
I would have the local service station turn it off, just for the heck
of it.  The light was off when I sold the thing, but I told the buyer
to expect it to come on.  He said, &quot;It's a Ford, I know the CE light
will come on, they are designed to do that, it has made dealers a lot
of money.... I'll just drive it.&quot;

Having managed a fleet of Crown Vic police cars, I can tell you that
this is a money making fraud.  They will charge you $1,100. the first
time they replace suspect parts, and another $1,100 dollars the second
time they replace the parts they didn't change the first time that
might cause the problem.  Two blocks from the dealership following the
second &quot;repair,&quot; the light will come on again.  While there may be
some harm done in one out of a thousand cases by operating the vehicle
with the light on, we never encountered such a case.  I don't know
what would happen if a fellow just removed the bulb... maybe the
computer would throw a fit...?  If it bothers you, black tape is far
less expensive than Ford dealerships!  I'm not so sure that a fellow
couldn't replace an engine for less $$ than 3-4 trips to a dealer to
replace parts that are supposed to turn off that light, but never do.

Almost forgot... the CE light came on in my (former) '94, 140,000 mile
LHS last year.  Turned out to be an  oxygen sensor.  (One of two.  The
other original one is still in the car, no problem.)  &lt;$50. later, it
was back on the road, no CE light!.  Ford has a better idea?

Can't argue that point, Lee.

I have heard of the &quot;limp home&quot; mode, but have never known a person or
seen a vehicle that has actually experienced it.  That is not to say
that it doesn't happen.  I'm sure that it would be a PITA!

But, if that happens, at least the dealership should be able to figure
out, for sure, what the problem is.  ?

I have an '03 GMC 1-ton *without* the engine information digital readout
option. When it thinks it wants an oil change, a message pops up on the
odometer readout! We had to do a lot of google (it is NOT in the manual) to
find the ruby-slipper-like routine you go through to turn it off (involves
pressing accelerator 3 times slowly with the key off, and I forget what
else, but the printout is in the glovebox now). GM obviously did not want me
to know how this is accomplished. Is there ANY CHANCE there's some screwy
secret handshake that resets your service light? Ford pickup owners must
also have a lodge hall somewhere, on a dirt road in the piney woods...

Back in '89 through about '92 Chrysler's new automatic transmission had a
common tendency to go into &quot;limp home&quot; mode.  My '92, however, bypassed
&quot;limp home&quot; and went directly to &quot;I need a ride home&quot; mode at 69,726 miles.
Thank goodness they had a 7-70 warranty then.

&gt; throw it at a new ATC scanner  for comparison.Same &quot;lowflow&quot; code.So
&gt; after confiring with a late model service tech friend (who states they
&gt; see A LOT of EGR flow codes these days), I follow his advise and
&gt; remove new EGR valve and run a length of wire into intake plenium to
&gt; remove and carbon crud blockage.I also start it with the EGR supply
&gt; tube disconnected from the new EGR valve and tack it up to 5ooo RPM a
&gt; couple of times to hopefully blow out the pipe. Optimisticly,or
&gt; niavely,you choose,I reattach all the pieces and plumbing and drive it
&gt; around.The light remains mute,so I think I got it wipped.Drove all day
&gt; like that,and was starting to get happy.Then,just as the front tires
&gt; touched the driveway after work the CEL turns on AGAIN,and in my head
&gt; I hear the ECM laughing at me. Next morning I  remember a friend gave
&gt; me a Haynes manual. While mot as good as a MOTOR manual,its better
&gt; than nothing! So I follow the diagnastic flow chart,which leads me to
&gt; the &quot;exhaust gas regulator&quot;,which is a electromechanical solonoid that
&gt; regulates vacuum to the EGR. So I call my local FLAPS,and John tells
&gt; me he has the &quot;exhaust gas flow sensor&quot;,but not the solonoid.&quot;What?&quot; I
&gt; ask,this is the first I have heard of such an item.

remove the throttle body and clean out the passages to the egr.
They're are two , you had the right idea with the wire but I feel like
you didn't get it clean enought. I've repaired dozens of Ford pu's in
this manner with the low flow EGR fault.

&gt;   So guessing since the EGR is new,it has a unfettered supply of
&gt; exhaust to it and all vacuum lines are 100%,the logical item is the
&gt; thing that regulates vacuum to the EGR. So we pay a visit to my
&gt; FLFD,and $51 bucks later,I have another shiney new part
&gt; underhood.Clear the trouble code and drive to work. About 2645 feet
&gt; from the parking light my old friend the CEL is lit up again!!! @#
&gt; %@*&amp;*#*&amp;!!!!!
&gt; So being of pissed mind and aggravated state,I hop on the net for a
&gt; Google of Ford EGR code issues.OMG!!! Quite the popular issue.Wish I
&gt; would have surfed first. So if I believe what I have read,I need the
&gt; &quot;flow sensor&quot;( for another $45 dollars). Aint technology grand??!!??
&gt; Hope to hell this cures the issue cause I am going batty.! Thanks for
&gt; letting me vent!!!...........Rich
