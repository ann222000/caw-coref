I saw "Lawrence Of Arabia" when it came out in 1962, in the sort of
grand roadshow presentation big movies used to get back then -- reserved
seating, an overture and intermission and an expensive souvenir program
on sale in the lobby (I still have mine.) My dad used to take me to
these big roadshow presentations of big films -- it was one of the great
rituals of my childhood.

"Lawrence" blew me away back then, at the age of twelve. I saw it a few
times later and was less impressed. As an adult I found the dialogue
excessively literary and aphoristic -- every line was a bon mot, a
philosophical nugget, an intellectual construction. Real people, I
thought, in real wars, don't talk like that -- even if they're
Oxford-educated British officers or wise old Bedouin chieftains.

Then I saw the restored version back in the Eighties, on a big screen,
and realized how wrong my second thoughts were. What I'd lost touch with
was the power of the images -- the extent to which the images are the
story of this film, its narrative and its subtext, its spectacle and its
subtlety. The moment of revelation came watching the shot where Lawrence
walks along the top of the captured train. His Bedouin followers run
along the ground below him. In the shot, we only see Lawrence's shadow
on the sand -- his followers chase his shadow.

This is the whole film in a single image -- the essence of the
filmmaker's view that Lawrence both invented himself in Arabia and lost
himself . . . created an image that had no substance beyond the events
it inspired, yet cast a real shadow into the future. In the last shot,
as Lawrence is driven away from the scene of his betrayed triumph, we
see his face through the windshield of an open car. A reflection on the
windshield suddenly obliterates his face, and the film is over.

This is a mode of filmmaking -- in which a film's deepest truths are
conveyed by images alone -- that characterized the silent era of cinema
and which is rarely seen today except in the theoretical film
experiments of Jean-Luc Godard. I began to see the dialogue of
"Lawrence" in a different light -- as the functional equivalent of title
cards, which offered a kind of running literary commentary on or
clarification of the images but did not drive the narrative or the drama.

In short, I realized that "Lawrence" is essentially a silent film -- in
the same sense that "Titanic" is essentially a silent film, a film whose
dialogue is virtually irrelevant to the actual meaning of the work.
Relatively unsophisticated twelve year-old boys and girls, for whom the
experience of a film is primarily visual and visceral, who feel no
intellectual need to translate a film into literary terms before being
able to appreciate it, have easier access to such sound-era "silents".
They are, in this, sometimes wiser than their elders.

I've never particularly liked Antonioni, but I think the difference
between The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia is
L'Avventura-- just as it's the difference between Spartacus and 2001,
or between High Noon and Once Upon a Time in the West.  Antonioni
taught the movies how to stare, how to be in the moment, even if the
moment in most of Antonioni's films is tedious.  But that influence is
powerful in a movie like Lawrence where the sheer experience of the
desert so dwarfs the more commonplace insights of Robert Bolt's script
(which isn't bad, by any means, but isn't particularly deep either).

Does that make it a silent film?  It certainly makes it a visual film--
and in some sense it took Antonioni after 30 years of yakkety-yak
(however splendid it often was) to get filmmakers back to that sort of
primacy of visuals, even though I don't think Lawrence is much like any
particular silent.

Lloyd, I agree with you wholeheartedly (and with full
knowledge that doing so automatically opens me up
to attack by the redoubtable Mr. Moran).  Remarkably
enough, I came to the same conclusion at the same
time, and even with the same shots in mind.  I'd seen
the film twice before, but neither previous screening
affected me quite as much as the restored version's
premiere at New York's Ziegfeld theater, a perfect
venue for that particular film.  The shot of O'Toole
atop the train still lingers in memory.  I've tried twice
to watch the restored version on DVD but can't get
through it.

I am inclined to agree with you, that sometimes you do see scenes in a
talking picture that are essentially moments from the silent screen,
where dialogue would be unneccessary, superflous or spoiling.

I saw an English TV film recently. A woman's husband was tragically
killed in a house fire. The local policeman has to meet the woman
coming back to her village from holiday and break the news to her. The
meeting is at the railway station. The whole scene is shot silent. The
train pulls in, and we see in long shot, the policman going to the
woman. Steam from the train is seen billowing around the couple. She
receives the news and is in partial collapse as the policeman's
comforting arm is placed around her. To me the power evoked from this
scene is far greater than had it been necessary to employ dialogue.

Godard was also interested in revivifying the cinematic image, rescuing
it from conventional service as exposition, so we could look at it with
fresh eyes -- the way the first movie audiences looked at actualities.
I doubt if Lean would have had any patience at all for Godard's
experiments, and he may not have cared much for Antonioni, either, but
there was something in the air among filmmakers in the 60s which caused
them to try and get back to the essence of the medium.

Well, the title cards are spoken on screen, for one thing -- but to me
it's like a silent in the sense that you can't get close to the heart of
it through its plot or its dialogue, as you can with "Citizen Kane" for
example, or even "The Rules Of the Game", which are also very visual
movies but allow us entry through their literary texts, if that's the
way we choose to proceed.  They would both work quite well, on some
level, as radio dramas.  Bolt's script would not.

"Lawrence" doesn't just represent a renewed emphasis on the visual,
either, per se.  Zooms and blitzkrieg montages and short-focus shots and
split-screen images were also commonly used by Sixties filmmakers --
highly visual effects that do not reference the silent era.  Lean's
style, and Godard's and Antonioni's, tended to focus on making
individual shots that drew the spectator into the illusory space of the
screen image -- a primary method of the silent screen, and one that John
Ford, among others, never lost sight of.

I saw the restored version at the Ziegfield, too -- one of the great
moviegoing experiences of my life.  Like "The Searchers", "Lawrence" is
a movie whose full "meaning" can never come through on a small screen --
though I do think a good DVD transfer on a big HD TV can get one close
enough to extrapolate what one is missing.

As might be apparent already, I've been watching "The Searchers" again.
A good four fifths of that film's drama takes place in silence, or
behind dialogue that has almost nothing to do with what's really
happening on screen.  The key to Ethan's whole character, his
relationship with his brother's wife, is conveyed entirely in looks and
gestures -- and most powerfully in the look on Ward Bond's face as he
DOESN'T watch them say their final farewell.

"The Searchers" is as successful a synthesis of silent and talkie
methods as there is.

Can anyone think of another talkie in which the prime motivating factor for
the protagonist is not mentioned in dialog one time in the whole movie?
That unspoken, unmentioned love story in THE SEARCHERS is the entire reason
for the movie.  I can't think of another similar example.
