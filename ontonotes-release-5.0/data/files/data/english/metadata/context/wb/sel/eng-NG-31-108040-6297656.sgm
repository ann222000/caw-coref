That's what I'm saying. Not of course in Mary's specific case, but as a
general warning that as with all things- there can be too much of a
good thing.

If the mechanical advantage is so overwhelming that foolish and
unskilled play will still buy you victory, or if the GM's foes are so
poorly ran that they would fall to the even the most inept tactical
choices- the result is a cheap and tainted campaign.

In days pass, this type of play was a key component in the description
of a "Monty Hall" GM.

One thus must walk something of a razor's edge to produce a feeling of
heroic capability in one's players.. The PCs must be overwhelming at
times, impressive and skillful- able to deal defeat against vast
numbers or topple an immense foe- *IF* they play well.

Error too far towards one side and you have players feeling they are
bumbling fools, barely able to tie their shoes without going below zero
hit points.

Error the other way, and you mechanically may as well declare PC
victory up front without even fighting the battles. Few Monty Hall
style games last for any length of time, as the joys it brings are just
too cheaply bought to matter in the long run.

To add more complexity to the matter, this edge is different for each
group as tactical ability varies greatly between people. One groups
best effort may equal the worse of another, and this is the reason for
different reactions to the same module.

I find that the best approach to the issue is for the GM to avoid
Homogeneous foes and adventures. Over the course of a campaign's major
story line, one should see the players hit everything from cakewalks to
battles where errors bring down serious outcomes. A constant grind on
either end will inflict either boredom or despair.

You know, though, that was in days past.

I have, in the last ten years, heard a lot of complaints about
too-hard scenarios.  I have heard an *enormous* number of complaints
about too-hard scenarios coupled with weak GM play or outright
fudging.  I don't think I've heard anyone complain that their
GM is giving them a consistent diet of encounters which, although
played accurately, are simply too weak to threaten the PCs.

Are we tying ourselves in knots to avoid a problem that really isn't
all that common, and causing ourselves a lot of grief in the process?

Jon, reading the bulletin boards on _Shackled City_ (I haven't
read them myself) says that there has been a lot of discussion of
the TPK scenario midway through.  A significant number of GMs
report that even though they were keen to continue the game, their
players wouldn't--they wanted to quit.  This is a working definition
of "not fun."

Yes, I agree.

One of my difficulties with _Age of Worms_ is that the encounters,
both setpiece and random, go from PC-1 to PC+4, but never below
that.  When the 5th level PCs go out on the road (in module #3) they
literally never encounter anything less than CR4.  This means they
will feel like they are just one step from the bottom of the totem
pole, even though they are 5th level.

We ran across that in our own homebrew campaign decades ago.  The GM
decided to suppress all the small encounters because they weren't
interesting.  After a few weeks of play the player was convinced that
her high-level PCs was totally overmatched, because everything
they met was seriously threatening, and nearly gave up the game.

OK, you're lumping together two things that have very different
"feels" to me. Both can cause a game to break down if carried to
excess, but the breakdowns in each case are only superficially alike.

In one case, the players have an overwhelming power advantage - e.g.
lots of bonuses from powerful magic items, which is what I think of
when the words "Monty Hall" (or "Monty Haul") are mentioned. The
opponents may do the best that they can, tactically, but that just
isn't good enough to overcome the power &amp; resource imbalance, even if
the players play sloppy and suboptimal.

In the other case, the players don't have an overwhelming advantage.
They may even be at a decided *dis*advantage wrt ability &amp; resources.
But the opponents use such poor tactics that the players can always
win anyway, provided their own tactics are at least halfway decent.

The first case can be a problem, yes. But I find that there's both a
lot more tolerance, among players, for it and a lot more GMing advice
warning against it. To the point where only grognards like us remember
the term "Monty Haul" and where the tendency is now for GMs to mess up
in the opposite direction.

The second case is a lot more harrowing for me to face as a player and
a lot more disturbing in terms of not being able to enjoy the victory
afterwards. There's a lot less GMing advice against it too. In fact,
ISTR a certain amount of advice *advocating* that GMs do this.

The first case still feels like a honest victory to me, even when it
becomes a cheap and boring one. The second case has a lot of the same
bad flavor as the GM fudging in our favor. It doesn't give as strong a
sense of boredom to play through, but it does give much more of a
sense of being cheated out of a honest victory. YMMV, but I was
suprised that you find them so much the same as to lump them together
like that.

Maybe it's like the video game problem, where the hardcore
gamer market drives the difficulty level of games, such that a
"casual" gamer like me can't even play a lot of the more
popular games?  You author a D&amp;D module and say that it's for a
certain level of characters, but your playtest group is a bunch
who live, breathe and shit D&amp;D, and they chew through your
"balanced" foe groups like cold pizza.  So you crank up the
difficulty level until your all-volunteer group of hardcore
nutjobs is satisfied that it presents a reasonable challenge.
A bunch of equally hardcore D&amp;D wanks at WoTC vetts your work,
and it goes on the market as-is, resulting in the characters of
'normal' people all over the globe getting slaughtered in
heaps.  ;-)

I think you may have it there.

It'd probably take up too much space for them to give difficulty
options as video games do...maybe using PCs of the "wrong" level
or number is really the best solution.  (Or writing your own, if
only I had time.  Alas.)

_Dungeon_ does give "If the PCs are 1-2 levels higher, do thus
and such; if they are 1-2 levels lower, do this and that."  But
when I've looked at these, I've immediately had two problems.
I don't think those get playtested at *all* and some of them are
crazy.  (They suggest doubling the difficulty of the upcoming
TPK in _Age of Worms_ if the PCs are even one level higher.)
And they are often of the form of "Give this guy two levels of
fighter, give that one a level of wizard, advance all of these
things three hit dice" which is so much work, I start to wonder
why I bought a module in the first place.

Nitpick: The 3.x CR system is suppose to set CR so that a CR5 monster
is one-quarter the strength of four 5th-level PCs, and a CR =
party-level+4 is suppose to be an even fight for a party of four PCs.
So they *ought* to feel as if they are at or near the *top* of the
totem pole if the toughest encounters they face are PC+4.

The problem, I think, is that the encounters tend to be single
monsters or smaller groups than the PC party. *That* makes the PCs
feel like bottom-of-the-heap types who only survive because they
outnumber most of the things encountered. A single minotaur and a gang
of 8 orcs are both EL4 encounters, but the 8 orcs are much more
morale-boosting to win against.

I'm far from certain about that. Instead, I think in many styles the
method has become accepted- a trend towards 'certain success' in gaming
that that you've previously noted yourself. People don't complain about
Monty Hall GMs anymore because that's now the common GM style.

In fact, given much of what was said about overwhelming player
advantage in that D&amp;D thread- my first thought here is that you're
making the common error of viewing the notable exception as the common
case. Assuming that how a module is written, is how it's in fact
played. Or I may be projecting onto you, it's a trap that I myself have
fallen in.

Outside of D&amp;D (such as the games favored at places like rpg.net and
The Forge), this trend is even stronger. So much so, that outside of
D&amp;D centered groups- I don't even see conversations about Difficulty
Balance anymore.

Boy that hits the mark. I have been involved in playtesting groups for
RPG and for wargames many times and it is very difficult to get
playtesters who recognize that most players don't want the kind of
challenges that these guys live for.

In hundreds of sessions over thousands of hours, I don't think there
was a single suggestion from the players that would have led to making
the game EASIER when we were playtesting a scenario. When playtesting a
system, it is entirely different. Playtesters will complain about game
mechanics that disadvantage the players. .

However, it is always less work to make a scenario easier than it is to make
it harder. Simply strike out a few of an enemy's skills or feats, or reduce
any other number on his character sheet by an arbitrary amount. And after
such changes, the NPC is still a legal character. Monsters can be made
easier to fight by reducing their numbers and/or having less monsters.

Upgrading an overly-weak character is harder because you have to (well, at
least ought to) add abilities in such a way that the stronger NPC is still
rules-legal. That usually means multiple simultaneous changes and is
significantly more complex.

So I'd always rather have a hard scenario I can tone down than an easier one
I have to beef up.

The glaring omission, of course, is actually pointing out to GMs that the
scenario is trying to err on the side of 'too hard' and giving guidelines on
where and how best to tone it down. My mythical Star Wars Bootleg Edition
does mention this trick, but judging from the postings given here maybe it's
unique in explicitly mentioning the matter.

This is how I feel also.  I don't mind a clean win against well-
played weak foes.  A steady diet becomes somewhat uninteresting
but can be saved by colorful tactics and terrain.  I really dislike
a compromised win, especially against a too-strong foe.  I quit
my last multi-player campaign over this.  I have never in (good
lord, that long?) 27 years even considered quitting a campaign
because the foes, while well-played, were weak.  I just don't
see that as a live issue in games I've played in or observed.

I do have one semi-counterexample to report.  Jon offered, years
ago, to run _Sunless Citadel_ for a PC party of mine that was
then two levels too high.  He offered to run it straight, but
I felt ashamed to take him up on that, so suggested that he
adjust for the PCs' level.  I then proceeded to hate it as it
was far too difficult for me.  I felt like an ass.  I can only
say in my own defense that I think there truly is social pressure
never to admit that you like things "easy" and I'd internalized
some of that.  I'd make the opposite call today.

easier one I have to beef up.

Following up on my own post - well, the point fits here as well as anywhere
else - the ease of a scenario also affects its tone, and the ease of a
series of scenarios will significantly affect the overall tone of a
campaign. Easier scenarios make for a more heroic tone. Harder scenarios
make for a grittier tone. That, I think, is another good reason to
specificially mention the issue and even legislate for it, thus giving GMs
the tools and the licence to adjust scenarios in the desired direction.
Players should probably have chances for input too. If some players
specifically wanted a heroic game while some others had no such preference,
a gritty game is likely to make the former players unhappy, while the latter
group may not think there's anything much wrong. Plainly not good.

Oh? O-kay . . .

Do you believe the reverse? That seems even more unlikely to me.

How can you be heroic when you're scrabbling to survive? In heroic
scenarios, characters almost always all survive, and if one of them dies
it's usually by choice - a heroic sacrifice. In gritty scenarios characters
die, and if a heroic sacrifice is necessary the characters will rarely get
the chance to choose who makes it. I consider Star Wars D6 - very low
mortality - to be heroic, and tough/killer DnD scenarios as discussed here
- higher mortality, possible TPKs, characters dying simply due to bad dice
luck - to be gritty. Being heroic is a luxury over and above surviving. If
the characters can barely survive, they have no margin in which to act
heroic - they may even have to minimax the rules and their characters in all
sorts of ways just to achieve the edge they need to survive. Make the
scenario easier, and characters get the chance to look beyond their own
immediate round-to-round survival and do more stuff that would generally be
considered heroic - such as sparing villainous NPCs, and performing flashy
but probably suboptimal combat moves during the fight. That sort of
behaviour makes for a heroic tone in my eyes, scrabbling merely for survival
doesn't.

holes in my own assertions.

When a person I despise says something that is exactly correct, I still
despise him but I have to say: hear hear.

What others have called heroic here is best called "cinematic."
Whatsisname didn't use that term but that is what he is talking about.
Even in good cinema, some heroism shines through but the cinematic
style of gaming is not about facing difficulty, it is about looking
cool and feeling like a kick-ass.

Roland did not say "You didn't give me enough magic items" before
facing the enemy. Miyamoto Musashi did not say "I want to look real
cool but don't give me any tough enemies."

Gritty is somewhat different from heroic but they are both far
different from cinematic. Whatsisname does have a good handle on this
whole issue.

Which do you consider more heroic?

A) A fighter pilot blowing up a column of enemy vehicles that lack the
ability to effectively fire back and kill the fighter pilot.

or

B) An infantry soldier who refuses to surrender against a force that will
almost surely kill him to buy time for others in his unit to escape
capture.

Do you want real heroism or a "heroic tone"?  Roller coasters feel
dangerous but they aren't really very dangerous.  So if you are looking to
describe a dangerous activity, would you point to riding a roller coaster
because it feels dangerous or would you point to something like crab
fishing off of Alaska where a person has a very real chance of dying?

What I think you are describing is to heroism what a roller coaster is to
danger.  It's the trappings of heroism that you can safely ride without
really getting hurt.  It's an amusement park ride version of heroism.

There are versions of hunting like this, too, where they put birds in
traps in release them right in front of the hunter, so the hunter is
certain to have a bird to shoot at and is almost certain to kill one or
more unless they are a really terrible shot.  It produces a predictable
outcome and spares hunters from spending their entire day roaming through
the woods without finding anything to shoot at, but is it hunting?

In a deadly scenario, characters have to use every trick in the book in
order to survive. That includes dirty tricks. Dirty tricks aren't heroic -
if characters do them, the tone of the game becomes increasingly gritty. If
characters /must/ do them in order to have any chance of survival, and
especially if they sometimes still die even then, it's a gritty scenario.
Being heroic, sporting and honorable involves refraining from performing
such dirty tricks. Therefore being heroic is a 'luxury' which characters can
only afford if the scenario is made slightly easier. I hope that makes the
distinction I'm trying to draw clearer.

But in order to sustain a heroic campaign, you can't have too high a
mortality rate. Individual characters constantly having to sacrifice
themselves selflessly (or 'heroically') stops feeling heroic after a time -
it becomes routine, especially from the point of view of the players and GM,
who witness /all/ the deaths - and I think that makes for a gritty tone,
even if individuals within the game are indeed being heroic. Heroic /tone/
requires such sacrifices to be relatively rare, otherwise they lose their
impact.

Those are all fair points. But my feeling is that you can't run a heroic
/campaign/ unless the characters have a reasonable survival chance in each
individual scenario. That means toning the difficulty down slightly - see
below, where I try to provide some ballpark numbers.

Ah, yes, that's a useful distinction, and one I wasn't making when I posted.
Try this, but note that the numbers are qualitative only:

Party operating at              Common result
150% of capacity                TPK

120% of capacity                Gritty tone,
survival a struggle,
regular character deaths

100%-110% of capacity           Tone somewhere between gritty and heroic
survival hard
occasional character deaths

90-100% of capacity             Lighter tone,
somewhere between heroic and cinematic
Survival acheivable
character deaths rare

80-90% of capacity              Cinematic tone,
Survival pretty much certain
Character deaths very rare

under 80%                       Very light tone
Becomes increasingly Monty Haul under 50%

This illustrates where /I/ think heroic tone fits into the gaming spectrum.
So I'd have to modify my original post and admit that I'm usually
running a cinematic game.

Is this a less contentious position, or do you still have issues with it?

PS, sorry, who's Whatisname?

&gt; Do you believe the reverse? That seems even more unlikely to me.

&gt; How can you be heroic when you're scrabbling to survive? In heroic
">

A hero is somebody who is willing to (frequently) put his life at stake
for some ideal (although it doen't have to be a "good" ideal). In order
to empower the players to create actually heroic characters, combat must
be (potentially) dangerous.

Another thing is "style", though. Style occurs when the PCs are
sufficiently on top of things that they (the characters - remember, the
players do not exist) feel they can make suboptimal choices. Each PC (as
well as each NPC) has his own style, his or her own tendency towards
certain kinds of suboptimal choices.

I'm in favour of "style", but also of combat being potentially
dangerous. My way of doing that is to have damage dependent on how many
(un-countered) successes you get on your attack roll (note to newcomers:
I'm *not* using Storyteller), multiplied by the weapon chosen (swords
tend to hurt more than daggers), but at the same time having a quite
large "damage span" between "incapacitated" and "dead".

&gt; scenarios, characters almost always all survive, and if one of them dies
&gt; it's usually by choice - a heroic sacrifice. In gritty scenarios characters
&gt; die, and if a heroic sacrifice is necessary the characters will rarely get

&gt; mortality - to be heroic, and tough/killer DnD scenarios as discussed here
&gt; - higher mortality, possible TPKs, characters dying simply due to bad dice
">

I think D&amp;D is irrelevant, because in the typical D&amp;D world, there are
no ideals (in the broadest possible sense of the word that still retain
any meaning) to put one's life at risk for. It typically ends up being
about material greed, and lust for character development (i.e. the
characters wish to gain levels). Any real problems are best solved by
superhuman NPCs (Elmonster, et cetera). This utterly fails to leave room
for heroism.

Brian's campaign is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth (not 3rd age, though,
AFAIK), which has obvious room for heroism.

What you call "heroic", I call "style". Or sometimes I call it

There is, though, an older definition of "hero", which boils down to
"extremely capable man". Ancient Greece or something. A definition that

Mid-Third Age about a hundred years after the plague.

Oddly it was the same time period the I.C.E. later selected. In my case
it's because it's a fairly large time slice without a extensive list of
already created events- and at a point where all the players I wanted

I like this set of numbers as a way to evaluate individual situations
but not entire campaigns. I elaborate below.

Those are intersting numbers but I think that the distinction between
"heroic" and "gritty" is less in the difficulty of the challenges and
more in the frequency of the challenges. The distinction you make
between them works very well for a single encoutner but a campaign can
be both or, of course, neither.

If a group of characters is repeatedly faced with extremely difficult
challenges, if the environment in which they operate is full of
death-threats from day to day, with few if any breaks, the campaign is
gritty. Now grittyness, as it were, is a quality that affects the
atmosphere of a campaign and there can be mildly gritty campaigns as
well as intensely gritty campaigns. A gritty campaign wears characters
down. If the climactic struggle or struggles of the campaign are
extremely challenging, the campaign can also be heroic, although very
gritty campaigns are already so challenging that the heroic moments may
not stand out. Characters in a gritty campaign will often be very
hard-pressed to meet heroic challenges when they do come. I think that
Mary, the original poster in the parent thread to this one, the one
about peeves, objects to the wearing-down quality of a gritty campaign,
as it is not fun to play. I tend to agree.

If the day to day challenges are less severe or if the characters spend
a great deal of time in activities that don't involve challenges but
the climactic struggle or struggles of the campaign are extremely
challenging, the campaign is also, in my opinion, heroic. This is true
even though the day to day atmosphere is much ligher. I think players
mind gritty a lot more than they do heroic. The campaigns I run tend to
be mildly gritty to non-gritty but they usually have some, often only
one, extremely challenging situations.

&gt; &gt; It's not an easy one to expand and I had to do some consideration of
&gt; &gt; it. I knew the statement was horribly at odds with my own viewpoint, a
&gt; &gt; reaction intensified by the section of your post I quoted above.

&gt; &gt; Flashy moves? Luxury? We have serious disconnect on what heroism is
&gt; &gt; here.

&gt; Yup,

&gt; &gt;&gt;From dictionary.com, first and thus most common meaning: &quot;a man of
&gt; &gt; distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble
&gt; &gt; qualities.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Where's the courage in a easy scenario?

&gt; There is, though, an older definition of &quot;hero&quot;, which boils down to
&gt; &quot;extremely capable man&quot;. Ancient Greece or something. A definition that
&gt; completely ignores the concept of idealism. It is basically, in RPG
&gt; terms, a person built on an extremely generous point budget.
">

I do actually  tend to prefer the modern and more romantic definition. But
I'm going to turn gleichman's question 'What noble qualities are displayed
by whacking down weaker foes?' on its head:

In a gritty scenario, characters must whack down every weaker foe as quickly
and brutally as possible, in order to buy themselves time to deal with the
deadlier opponents. That /isn't/ noble. And I feel that is a characteristic
that is common /both/ to the most deadly scenarios /and/ also to the 'Monty
Haul end of the spectrum. In deadly scenarios, characters don't have time to
show mercy. They don't have time to try to make a called shot that disables
an opponent without killing him - if they miss, they've wasted a round, and
that could be the difference between victory and defeat. I contend that
showing mercy is a luxury. Characters can only do that if they've got a
little bit of slack - i.e. a slightly easier scenario. At the Monty Haul
end, the characters will slaughter everything because they can and because
it's fun, but I can't say I really care what happens in that sort of game.

So gleichman and I seem to be in agreement that whacking down weaker foes
isn't particularly noble, but I think it's about equally common in the
hardest scenarios as in heroic ones. In truly heroic scenarios, characters
should have sufficient leeway to start showing some restraint - disabling
and sparing weaker foes - and should begin doing so.

I'm uncertain what exactly counts as "dirty tricks" in your view.

Using my own version of "dirty tricks" as a benchmark, I have the
following to say:

The definition for hero required them to be both brave &amp; noble. Using
"dirty tricks" obviously fails both requirements (something you note as
well).To do so, the player would have to place greater value upon his
survival than his honor (and in Middle Earth, the long term success of
many heroic goals) and thereby fails the test of heroism in the game.
Simply put, he's not a hero.

One earns everything one has in my game, including that title.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In my campaign, not every game has heroic events. Often one just shows
up and does their job, their duty, or moves a little closer (or
farther) from a goal.

I also run at about a 40% mortality rate over what I consider an
"character adventure era", but in the long term it's close to 100% due
to the generational nature of the campaign (the presence of immortal
elves offers some chance for a "left for the west" ending, but I
consider it remote).

Most of those deaths are not heroic. Some are.

Most people would call that a highly lethal game. However it may not be
given the length of those campaigns (mine and its sister campaign) and
the length of theirs. I've read that the typical campaign is measured
in months, ours is measured indecades and that likely has a impact on
this debate.

A character may not die for 6 months, and then one might lose three or
four in row.

October 8th, 1918 Corporal Alvin York of the 328th Infantry led seven

Real life is a brutal as it gets- there was no firing to wound or

Funnily enough, I'm the only player I know who has actually had a character
steam in, slaughter some foes and then in a bull-like voice demand surrender
from the remainder. I'm entirely happy with that as a definition of heroic.
And in a bit you snipped I said "whacking down weaker foes isn't

after having killed some, the hero demands surrender from the remainder,
while in a gritty scenario he then goes on to try to slaughter the rest as
well. It's not the butchery that's heroic, it's the later restraint.

Of course, the butchery is a necessary prelude, otherwise how can you show
you are capable of carrying out the threat? Characters who charge in and
immediately demand surrender without killing anyone are trying a bluff;
that's even lower down the violence scale - so 'cinematic' rather than
'heroic'.

This to me is a counsel of perfection.  There is some player out there

If my characters have to act extremely precisely in order to live, I
do not personally find myself capable of good roleplaying.  Consider
the situation where a PC spends a round to save the life of an
honorable foe.  The whole party dies, becuase that PC's input could not
possibly be spared for even one round.  Speaking only for myself, whatever
satisfaction I might have felt in that small detail is swamped by the
massive impact of failure, and *failure caused by my character*.  If
there are other players, I shrink under the impact of their pain and
disappointment, and possibly their anger with me.

Next time I won't do it.  There exists a perfect player who can keep
roleplaying excellently through many experiences like this, but I'm not
her.  I play for fun, and this is not enough fun.

I also stop experimenting with new tactics.  It's too dangerous to try
anything new if every scenario is close to the killing edge.  So I stop
learning, and eventually I play very badly.  We had this in SCAP.  At
8th level my PCs were no more competent than they had been at 5th; partly
because I had not had time to learn to play them, but partly also because
without easier scenarios, there was no opportunity for experimentation and
refinement of tactics.  I could not afford to try something new that might
not work out.

&lt;sigh&gt;  What this conversation is doing for me is constantly rubbing
salt in wounds.  I wish I were a stronger person and able to shrug it
off, but right now I'm not.  I feel as though I'm being blamed (personally

and probably the Loss of the Heroic Ideal, and it hurts.  I didn't
really expect this response from .advocacy.  Elsewhere, yes, but not here.
I think I have to beg off.  I might come back in 6 months or so when
things improve, or I might try ruthlessly killfiling everyone who

It's hardly advice of perfection because I didn't in any sense mean it
to reference actions of that type. To me, that isn't role-playing as
such- it's an action that may or may not be possible according the
rules and other effects outside the control of the player.

Instead what I was speaking of was your *wish* to save the life of that
honorable foe, the display of emotion when you decide to do so, or
decide not to do so. There is nothing to prevent you from doing that
mechanical or situationally. We see it all the time in fiction, and all
it takes in a game is the willingness of the players to spend a bit of
time on between combat actions.

To me, Role-playing is deciding what you wanted to do, if you do it,
and your reaction to your final choice. Not the action itself.
Certainly more difficult games mean less freedom of action- otherwise
they wouldn't be difficult.

My group doesn't suffer the same problem. They have proven to be quite
willing to let their characters die for another who is acting in a
heroic manner- and will do so with much glee in fact. Non-heroic
characters don't normally get the same loyality, but I've seen it even
there.

But then again, I don't have script immunity, nor do I have your other
requirements from a game- many of which seem in direct conflict to my
own PoV.

Thus not having seen or dealt with the problem, I have no advice for
you although I can feel a degree of empathy and almost (but not quite)

I'm sorry you feel that way, especially over something that wasn't what

The character decides he can't afford to do the honorable thing.
Emotions:  shame, guilt, remorse, self-hatred.  The character
decides he must do the honorable thing, and dies.  Emotions:  grief,
disappointment, loss, and if the other players or GM dogpile me with
criticism also shame, guilt, anger and frustration.

The best solution for me is not to think about it at all:  suppress
the roleplaying.  I am not willing to consistently make decisions for
which all outcomes are negative, and to me that's what this is.

If this happens too often I become sufficiently numb that I don't
experience any emotions about what my character does at all, after
which it doesn't make much sense to roleplay them--we play one-on-one
so there are no other players to be entertained, and the GM knows
me much too well to be fooled.

Yes, I understand this response. I have it in different areas myself with

You can, and I certainly wouldn't call you on it (nor would I invite you to

First, I think your problem here may have something to do with the
fragility of immersion, which is why I have a problem doing the same
thing.  I can play out tactical combat effectively, but when I'm playing
out tactical combat in that way, I'm playing it like a board game, I'm not
thinking in character. As a result of the immersion stopping, the
role-playing stops, too.  That's the part Brian might be missing here.
It's not a matter of finding time.  It's a matter of precise tactical
thinking suppressing the way in which you role-play.

Second, but I do think there is some merit to Brian's suggestion to find
time for role-playing, though not maybe in such a direct and blunt way.
An overly simple way to do that is to spend less time on combat in the
game (though that's difficult with D&amp;D).  Perhaps another way to look at
it is to find ways to switch modes during combat. There, I think your
technique of running multiple characters increases the problem
substantially.  The way I maintain role-playing during tactical combat is
to spend the time while other players are dealing with their characters to
make a tactical decision and then do some thinking in character.  That
option may not be open to you.

Third, part of the solution for you might be to use combat systems that
rely less on the player's ability to succeed and more on the character's
abilities as written down and dice.  From these examples, examples you
gave years ago, and my own experience trying to both immerse and think
tactically, tactical thinking often happens at the player level rather
than in character.  There are two ways to rely more on the character's
abilities.  The first is to figure out how to think tactically in
character.  I can't do that very well and suspect you might not be able
to, either.  The second is to abstract combat so that it's resolved more
heavily with character abilities as reflected on the character sheeet and
less heavily on the player's ability to tactically manipulate the
character.  Basically, if thinking tactically damages immersion and thus
role-playing, tactical thinking should be reduced and perhaps systems like
D&amp;D, which are heavily tactical, should be avoided.

Finally, you could always resort to hero points or other metagame
mechanics to keep your PCs alive.  While they can cause immersion
problems, there are ways to make them more palatable, especially if they
aren't always used.  After all, the reason why characters in books,
movies, and TV shows survive one near miss after another is that the
author decides that they will live by fiat.  Ways to reconcile hero points
with an immersive perspective include playing characters that don't think
about those things very much (that works very well for me) and playing
characters that believe in luck, destiny, or divine protection.

I think there is an implied association between non-optimal play and
role-playing here.  And, yes, I think that's a problem with published
challenge-oriented D&amp;D modules because they don't expect the players to
make sub-optimal decisions.  I don't think role-playing has to necessarily
imply sub-optimal decisions, because one can role-play a competent
combatant that values optimal decisions in character.  But that does
reduce the range of characters that you can play in such a game.

Here is where I think you should probably make use of retcons.  Play
combats more than once if you have to.  That's very similar to how video
games allow players to experiment.  The player saves the game, wades into
the encounter, and if it goes badly, they replay it.  I know you've
experimented both with talking through role-playing scenes to anticipate
where they'll go and replaying scenes that go badly.  Have you tried that
with combat in D&amp;D?

&gt; and as a representative of a group) for the Decline of Modern Roleplaying
&gt; and probably the Loss of the Heroic Ideal, and it hurts.
">

My comments on heroism have a context that wasn't directed at you and have
a lot more to do with the problems of translating fictional heroism into a
role-playing games.  Real heroes like Sgt. York usually survive one heroic
situation and then never have another one again.  A lot of would-be heroes
die, as to people who try to repeat heroic acts over and over again.  In
fiction, the heroes survive constant danger because they have script
immunity.  But real heroism requires a risk of loss.  Follow me for a
moment because I'm not trying to condemn you or anyone else.

The man who recently saved a person in New York City who had fallen onto
the subway tracks wasn't put on David Letterman because he helped the man
while he was having seizures on the subway platform (which he did).  That
probably wouldn't have warranted mention even in the local papers.  He was
a hero for jumping onto the tracks in front on a train after the man fell
onto the tracks and opting to risk that he could fit under the train to
save the man rather than jumping out of the way of the train.  If there
was no very real risk, the sort that deters most sane people from doing
anything, he wouldn't have been a hero.  In fact, beyond the danger, a key
part of heroism is that it's not something anyone and everyone would do.

That said, (A) everything a character does doesn't have to be heroic, (B)
there is nothing wrong with finding out ways to tilt the odds in your
favor, and (C) a person can be a good guy doing important things without
being a hero.

To the first point, video games follow (or at least they used to follow) a
pattern where the player would defeat hoards of easy-to-defeat monsters in
order ot face a very hard to defeat enemy (the boss) at the end.  A game
might have thousands of easy to defeat monsters and only a handful of
bosses.  In such a situation, killing the little monsters is not heroic.
Facing the boss at the end is, because that's where the character has a
good chance to die.  Translated into a role-playing game, the idea is to
put the player up against a few powerful "bosses" which give them the
opportunity to be heroic.  So every encounter isn't heroic.  Only a few
are.  The characters are still heroes but don't face a TPK at every turn.
And as an added bonus, those small easy-to-defeat enemies show that the
characters have the skill and stature to face the "boss" and give them
plenty of practice to prepare for that face-off.  In fact, there are
plenty of action movies, including James Bond movies, that seem to follow
a similar model.

To the second point, there us nothing unheroic about getting an advantage,
figuring out a weakness, or even sneaking past a powerful enemy.
Outwitting an opponent is just a legitimate as outfighting them.  And
there is nothing wrong with a character robbing themselves of a moment of
true life-threatening heroism becaue they figured out a way to reduce
their risks and achieve their goals at the same time.  Potential heroes
don't have to be stupid and risk their lives without need.

Finally, there are plenty of admirable people in this world who do good
things without necessarily being heroes.  While the fighter pilot who
blows through a column of enemy troops without any personal risk might not
be a hero in the strictest sense, they are performing an important service
to those fighting on the ground for their side.  In other words, so long
as the characters are doing something important, who cares if they are
real heroes or not?  So they don't earn a medal or get their picture on
the front page of a paper?  That still doesn't mean that the characters
can't be interesting to play and do important things.  Every character
doesn't have to be a hero in the sense of risking their lives for others.

Now there is a school of thought that calls every soldier, Marine, sailor,
pilot, police officer, firefighter, etc. a hero.  While there is some
merit to that and I can understand the sentiment, it simply leaves us in
need of another term to differentiate the guys who actually risk their
lives for others.

As to my roller coaster analogy, I made it for a reason.  Most people want
to feel that they are in danger but far fewer people want to really be in
danger.  That's why more people ride roller coasters than do things like
base jumping, cave diving, or climbing Mount Everest.  There is nothing
wrong with riding a roller coaster and enjoying the feeling of danger
while minimizing risks.  Most people aren't real danger-seekers.  But a
roller-coaster is not real danger.  Similarly, there is nothing wrong with
playing a character that

There are a lot of elements of the psychology of warfare that get swept

&gt;&gt; I have to agree with Mary here. And even if it's still possible to
&gt;&gt; roleplay
&gt;&gt; during a really difficult scenario, it's going to be easier still to
&gt;&gt; roleplay in a slightly easier scenario.
&gt; This is nothing more than &quot;Gamist == hack &amp; Slash == roll-player not
&gt; role-player&quot; nonsense all dressed up in not so new clothes.
&gt; I find it objectable in the extreme.
">

I'm not sure that's true, though I think it might point to why so many
people make that assumption.

I think it has to do with how people approach role-playing.  There are
people who decide what their characters will do and people who think in
character.  I'm the latter sort.  So is Mary.  I find it incredibly
difficult to juggle both thinking in character and thinking about combat
in a tactically optimal and omniscient way.  Thus the more tactical
thinking I do, the less in character role-playing I'm usually doing.

A key part of Gamism (r.g.f.a sense) is challenging the *player*.  When I
role-play immersively, I don't want to be thinking as myself as the
player.  I want to be thinking in character.  Some people have no trouble
thinking about the game from their character's perspective and also from
the player's perspective or toggling quickly between the two.  Some do.
I do (I got into a rather lengthy debate with Vincent Baker and others
about this on RPGnet).  Thus for me (and others), the goals of Gamism
conflict with immersion and thus, by extension, "role-playing".  The
problem is the assumption that everyone has the same problems and
limitations that I do, and vice versa.

What I think might help here is if you explained what role-playing means
to you and how it gets managed in practice in your games.  It would be
interesting to know if your players are doing the same thing I'm doing but
deal with the situation better or if they are doing something different or
doing it a different way.

If I can ask without causing offence, do you think that if you made your
scenarios slightly harder, the quality of roleplaying for your group would
rise or fall?

And if you made them slightly easier?

Or are you exactly at a 'sweet spot'?

Or is there a reasonably wide difficulty band in which the quality of role
play stays constant?

Are you sure your players would give the same answers as you to these
questions?

Grossly harder or grossly easier, I'd expect the system to break down quite
rapidly for almost all GMs, but it's the small changes I'm interested in.
For myself, I could probably make things a bit harder and not see a
reduction in quality of role play, but personally I'd /not/ want to make
things easier. But then I'm running at a radically different point in the difficulty
spectrum to you.

As I saw it, Simon was assuming that difficult tactical thinking is
detrimental to role-playing and then built some comments on top of that
assumption.  And I wonder if the key to the whole assumption that one must
choose between "roll-playing" and "role-playing" derives from an inability
for many people to imagine a person doing both at the same time.  It's
not uncommon for people to assume that what's not possible for them is not
possible for others.

I think that part of the problem is the assumption that both are
inherently tied together.  For some people, they are.  For other people,
they aren't.

It also depends on what you mean by "role-playing".  Does this go back to
flashy cinematic actions and decisions, like it did with "heroism", or is
it simply playing the character in character or something else?

You also need to remember that there are other issues involved here.
Mary strongly dislikes playing hopeless causes.  I've had some fun playing
a character whose addiction to a dark form of magic was ultimately fatal.
How the players think about PC death and their expectations for the game
also play a huge role here.

I think I just spotted a key point of difference.  Thinking about the same
thing does not necessarily produce the same "load" on different people. A
person who is practiced in thinking tactically or who has a natural
aptitude for thinking that way will not experience the same sort of "load"
that a person who has little practice thinking tactically or has no
aptitude for thinking tactically will experience.  If you've ever watched
a person struggle with something that you find easy or vice versa, you've
seen this type of thing in action.  In fact, I've played with people for
whom role-playing was the chore because it didn't come naturally to them.

As I've already stated, I run a rather wide range of difficultly in my games
already. There's been no significant difference between them in role-playing
of notice and if I had to make a claim I'd say it increased the harder it
became as the stakes increased.

I'm also rather certain most and perhaps all my original and current players
(regulars of course, visitors don't get a vote unless they wish to stay)
would agree.

There is of course a break-over point when the game is nor longer fun (be it
reached by either peak or consistent difficulty level). That doesn't reduce
role-play directly. It makes the game unfun and *that* reduces role-play,
assuming play even continues. That breakover point varies by the person, and
I have encounter groups where my style exceeded their limits (and their
desire for easier wins exceeded mine).

difficulty with the frequency of the challenges, not with the
difficulty of the challenges. If every day in character is a grind of
fighting, planning, problem-solving and then fighting again or, worse,
fighting, fighting and fighting again, it would be very difficult for
anyone to roleplay.

My friend Andy used to run campaigns that were all encounters. The
encounters were not super-tough. In fact, he never did have a climactic
encounter with a major enemy, just one slog against Orcs or Ogres after
another. But The PCs never had any time to talk to one another, plan or
interact with non-hostile NPCs. He said he didn't want to bore people.
After a couple of campaigns broke up he asked people to just tell him
what he was doing wrong and everyone gave their opinions. He has since

&gt;logical sense.
">

There's a couple of senses of "have time".

One is:  do the characters have time?  If each and every PC must do the
tactically perfect thing each and every round of combat or it's TPK, my
subjective sense is that there is "not time" for any roleplaying, at
least not the kind that is expressed in character actions.  I suppose the
PCs could talk or feel, but their decisions cannot express their
characters, because they don't have any "spare" decisions, except the
decision to die.

If the result of making a decision driven by character personality is
predictably character death, I will stop doing it.  And if my characters'
decisions no longer express their personalities, I do not consider myself
to be roleplaying.

The other is:  does the player have time?  This can take several forms.
The player may have goals:  I'd like to see such-and-such game events
in the next month.  If she has 10 hours to play this month, and needs
to do 6 hours of detailed tactical combat and 4 hours of prep and
item-buying, she has to choose between failing to meet her goals, and
not doing any conversations.  I find that if the game moves too slowly,
I lose interest; so each hour spent on overhead is an hour lost to
roleplaying, after a point.  And in my hands high-threat games are
very, very high overhead, because you *cannot make mistakes*.  Check
everything twice.  Prepare backup plans and shop for those too.  Count
every gold piece:  you may need them all.  Redo the spell loadout before
*every* encounter, because one slip and you die.  I just may not be
able to do all that and roleplay too, and hold down a day job, and
have anything actually happen in the campaign.

Or the player may simply be overloaded.  In _Zenith Trajectory_ I
could not think about what my PCs were thinking and feeling; I was going
crazy just trying to track spell durations and the like.  Slowing the
game down does not help because the slower you go, the worse the memory
burden becomes.  Maybe "enough time" is a bad phrase for this but
subjectively that's how it felt.

We also didn't want to split _Zenith_ over two sessions; we thought both
GM and player would catastrophically lose their grasp on the mechanics,
with 30+ durationed spells to track.  That means, every minute spent on
character thoughts and feelings is another minute of that session, and it
took 7 hours already.  I'm not physically capable of much more.

I don't believe tactics and roleplaying are mutually exclusive.  But for me
as a player, the demand for *perfect* tactics is lethal to roleplaying.  And
that is how I interpret high-lethality games.  I don't believe I am able
to change that interpretation; I invest too much in my PCs and lose too
much when they die.  If I can see that by being tactically better I could
have saved them, I'm going to feel incredible pressure to do it, even if
it's unenjoyable--till eventually the whole thing is unenjoyable and dies.

I do roleplay better when the scenario is easier.  I'm sorry you find that
offensive, but damn it, it's true.  I'm not claiming it's true of anyone
but myself, but I think you should allow that I know it of myself.  And
"not enough time" describes a lot of the problems fairly well.

I'm still tired of being called a fool, too.

Interesting question, I don't recall attempting to express it before. One of
the reasons I like this group.

Reflecting upon it, I doubt that I personally could in D&amp;D.

The problem would be that I couldn't view my decisions from the PoV of my
character. This is for much the same reason that other have expressed
problems with Fate points and other player-based mechanics. The ability to
swap the game mechanics and process for the sensory input and knowledge of
the character become difficult the more distance those methods are from what
they are representing.

D&amp;D at it's core is a working game system (with many break points IMO, but
there are certainly working points as well), but it's a horrid handle for me
to hold onto from a character's PoV.

My chosen systems however are easily used towards that end by me. My
tactical and character decisions are one and the same- different characters
will chose different tactical options as suit their personnalities, goals
and experiences. Now if that is a matter of using using systems that are
better representatons, or of using systems whose abstraction I both agree
with and deeply understand can be debated. But the result can't.

I have trouble with this, but I also have trouble specifically with

One thing has dawned on me in writing this.  It seems obvious now but I
hadn't grasped it before.

We play single-player, multiple-PC.  It works for us as we're married to
each other and it is much easier to schedule that type of game than with
a group, and also we really like each others' play styles.  But.  If
a group of 6 players hits one of these modules and one PC dies each
session, each player has experienced one session with their PC dying
and five without.  If I do it, I have had the experience of losing a
PC *every single session*.  The impact is worse.

In terms of emotional impact, it may be that one should count deaths
per player and not deaths per character, and we need to drop the
lethality level sixfold over what a multi-player group could handle.
(No, having more than one PC doesn't buffer it at all, for me.
I thought it might, but we've been doing this for 20 years now and I
can conclusively report otherwise.)

The GM is not omniscient and in general cannot give much useful advice
on the specific tactics of my party.  So there is no one available to
do the fencing-master thing.  We can have a fun conversation but it
will not cover the fact that I don't know how to use the PCs' trickier
abilities.

Example:  you can buy potions of Bless Weapon that will get through a devil's
DR10/good.  But they last a *minute*, and don't work on missile weapons.
How do you use them tactically?  I have failed every time so far:  too soon
or too late.  How to realistically practice this?  I didn't even know it was
a problem until the first time I tried to do it in combat.  And I can't ask
a fencing master, because the GM has no clue either.  I'm not sure this item
*is* usable, but I doubt I'd ever have known without trying it repeatedly
in play.

"It's not the things you don't know that will kill you.  It's the things
you know that ain't so" (like the idea that potions of Bless Weapon can
be used to fight a devil).  Real combats reveal this.  I don't know how
to set up a practice scenario that does, because I don't know where the
issues *are* in advance.

We could do a lot of fake combats, but I would rather do real combats
against not-so-lethal opponents than do fake combats.

Let's go through these one by one

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One is:  do the characters have time?
">

I don't see this as a time issue because it's character focused,
role-playing it is role-playing it. You may not think the result fun, and
you may therefore withdraw from the game, but it is what it is and it is
most certainly not something I thought of as time nor is it now.

I'd use the term pressure myself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The other is:  does the player have time?
">

This is the "speed chess" option I mention, but again- time isn't the
primary cause.

Instead the group has chosen a game system who's complexity and/or overhead
(which is not related to adventure difficulty) is too great for their time
restraints. Many systems play much faster and with less mechanical effort.
Either switch to a system suitable to the time constraint, or extend the
time limit.

Again, I don't see this as time issue. The player may wish to express it
that way, but what they are really saying is "I don't have time to play this
using D&amp;D".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or the player may simply be overloaded.  In _Zenith Trajectory_ I
&gt; could not think about what my PCs were thinking and feeling; I was going
&gt; crazy just trying to track spell durations and the like.
">

Same as the above, use a system the player can handle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do roleplay better when the scenario is easier.  I'm sorry you find that
&gt; offensive, but damn it, it's true.
">

Frankly I don't care if it's true for you. If you want to claim that you can
only role-play when dipped in low fat butter, I have no choice but to assume
it's true.

What I care about is blanket statements that imply its true for everyone,
including myself. Which is exactly the battle with fighting with Simon Smith
right now. I also dislike expression a problem in the wrong time (time in
this case) because I have to translate terms when I next see them used.

Not knowing the scenario, I don't know how hard it was. However, this
seems more about the difficulty making the game depressing and
disappointing, rather than it making roleplaying specifically
difficult. Eventually, of course, if the game is no fun, you lose the
desire to roleplay.

It has to be, if you can play six characters and stay connected to
them. I can't and I don't try. One PC death out of six per session is a
huge fatality rate in any case. My PCs don't always triumph but the
death rate is much lower than that. However, I get the impression that
these scenarios involve combat a great deal more often than my
campaign.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If I could really play six characters at once, I would feel the same
way I am sure. On the other hand, multi-player games would seem to give
one more time and scope for role-playing.

The GM I know where several "hats." It varies from campaign to campaign
but it is often useful to ask advice from one of the NPCs.

This is one where the GM could well say "I have no idea how that
works," even in the persona of someone you would normally go to for
advice. Going by what I remember from pre-AD&amp;D and First Edition D&amp;/D,
this may be insoluble. One minute is a very short time in those rules.

It sounds very difficult to use to me. I guess I would assume that it

A matter of taste but practice is always available and suitably easy

It is awfully easy to try to say "I prefer this" and end up saying
"this is the only way." If one tries to make a case for ones POV and
preferences, it can come out like an attack. . Frankly, I can see how
you might have taken some of my early posts in this thread personally
and I would apologize for any offense I inadvertantly gave. And I do.
On the other tentacle, I don't see how you could think gleichman was
attacking you.
