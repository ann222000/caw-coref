MM Update:
I thought I would expand my comments on this, just to try to do it
justice

OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?

LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

MM:
The Master comes for a &quot;season,&quot; as was mentioned
regarding John the Baptist. Laertes says to take
advantage of the Master, while he is in the body.

MM Update:
What is the &quot;trifling of his favour?&quot;  It's the Master's grace.  If we
are smart, we will try to please the Master, to invoke his grace.
Without his grace, we will remain lost souls, going around in circles
in this wilderness of Satan.  We have been doing that for ages, so
Shakespeare advises us to take advantage of the Master while he is in
the body.

What does &quot;hold it a fashion,&quot; mean?  Fashions come and go.  God comes
and goes.  Sometimes, he comes as a man, sometimes a woman.
Sometimes, he comes as a very loving person.  Sometimes, he comes as a
strict taskmaster.  Sometimes, he gives the teachings clearly and to
the point.  Other times he gives them cryptically.  So, my point is
that God can come in various fashions.  He can come as a Chinaman, an
Arab, an Englishman, an Indian, or even an American.

What does &quot;a toy in blood mean?&quot;  Obviously, a toy is something which
children enjoy.  So, we are like children before the Master.  We
should enjoy his company while it lasts.  &quot;In blood,&quot; clearly means
that the Master is in the body, which is composed of flesh, blood, and
bones.  The Master will only be in the body for a specified period,
known by God.  So, it will behoove us to take advantage of him, while
we are in the body, and he is in the body.

What does &quot;a violet in the youth of primy nature.&quot; mean?  It means
that the Master has a childhood, a youth, a middleage, an oldage, and
a death.  Sometimes, his &quot;season,&quot; i.e. the time allotted to him by
God is so short, that he doesn't even reach old age.  Some Masters,
such as Christ and Marlowe, have died in middle age.  So, the point is
clear, if we don't know how long the Master will be with us, then we
should take advantage of his presence now.

What does &quot;forward,&quot; mean, in this context?  It means that the Master
is always looking forward to going back to the True Home.  It is a
place of unsurpassed beauty and peace.  He doesn't want to remain in
this pigpen of a world any long than he has to.  We should remember
that, and take advantage of his presence now.  Christ said, &quot;I go to
place, where ye cannot come.&quot;  We should work hard on our meditation,
so that we can qualify to reach that place, the True Home.

What does &quot;not permanent,&quot; mean?  It means that he is not permanently
with us.  The body will die and decompose one day, so we should take
advantage of the Master, while he is in the human form with us.

What does &quot;sweet, not lasting,&quot; mean?  It means that the time spent
with the Master is sweet, but it won't last.  That is why we need to
lay up treasure in heaven, and reach the Holy Spirit Form of the
Master.  That form is permanent.  That form will be with the disciple
forever, as Christ said.

What does the last line mean?  The perfume and suppliance of a minute,
no more?  It means that relatively speaking the Master will be gone
shortly.  Vis-a-vis Eternity, the Master is only here for the blink of
an eye.  It is relative.  Satan lulls into thinking that the Master
will be with us for a long time.  He lulls us into procrastination.
He lulls us into putting so many things before the Master, not the
least of which is our own ego.  We might think, well, someday I might
have time for the Master?  Walt Whitman wrote,  &quot;Will you prove too
late.&quot;  If we go to find the Master, and he has already died, then it
will be too late for us.

John 5:33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.   34
But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye
might be saved.   35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were
willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

That may be your point; Shakespeare's point appears to be very
different.  Hamlet has just been chastised by Claudius and Gertrude
for wearing mourning; Polonius is about to advise Laertes on how he
should dress while in France (falsely modest -- that's important:
people are watching); and Ophelia will, when her Dad leans on her,
object that he has importuned her with love &quot;in honorable fashion,&quot; to
which Polonius will reply, &quot;Ay, fashion you may call it!  Go to, go
to.&quot;

What is at question is the extent to which appearance and performance
can be said to truly signify that which is within.

There is nothing here about reincarnation or the divine embodiment.

Why would anyone want to fear God, that is the dumbest thing I have ever
heard in my life.  If you don't realize by now the love of God, why are you
even in yoga.  That's what yoga is all about, it is to show someone that God
is to be loved and not feared, in yoga don't have to believe all the
hearsay, which sounds like Christianity more than Buddhism.

&quot;best safety lies in fear&quot; to me this would be talking about anything except
God, because if God is in you and you are in God, then that's where the word
oneness come from,  there is no fear, you are at one!!

MM:
You want to diagree with Shakespeare and with all the Masters?  It's
your prerogative.

The wisest thing we can do is &quot;fear offending God.&quot;  God doesn't look
for excuses to punish us, but if we misuse the human form, he can take
it away.  Look around you.  Do you see the lower species?  Do you see
animals, birds, insects, water creatures, and plants?  Why are they in
that condition, and we are in this better condition?  Answer:  God's
will.  If we look analytically, we will see that humans are a tiny
percentage of all the life on this planet.  Humans are favored.  Who
gave them this favored status?  Answer:  God.  What God has given, he
can take away.  Christ said, &quot;He who ears to hear, let him hear, there
will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;  The architects of the
Christian Religion tried to edit out all the references to
reincarnation, but somehow, that one survived.  We should take it
seriously.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

MM:
Are you serious?  If there is so much of God's love, then why are we
living in chaos?  It is obviously more of a punishment on earth, than
a paradise.  I think maybe you are living in fantasyland.  Try to look
at everything around you.  You should see that it is not all a
paradise.  People are starving everyday.  Is that the love of God?  Is
it a punishment?  Your contention raises too many questions, while my
contention is more logical.  Go into a prison and tell them about
God's love.  Go into a hospital full of terrminally ill people, and
thell them about God's love.

MM:
I'm not saying to fear God, himself, but fear offending him.  If you
love someone you won't want to offend them.  That is the principle
behind it.  God is very lenient, very merciful, but if we offend him
too much, he could destroy a city, country, or even the whole planet.
This wholesale destruction has been called a dissolution, or on a
bigger scale, a grand dissolution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

MM:
It's not just lip service.  It involves dismantling our ego, and
casting off all sinful habits.  We can't just say, prematurely, I'm
one with God, if we are still sinning everyday.  We should reach his
level, then we will know the difference between right and wrong.

Yoga means to unite.  We can try, with the help of a Master, to unite
with higher levels of consciousness.  God is available to human
beings, if we can qualify.  Living in fantasyland is not the answer.
Facing the reality, that this world is a MIXTURE of rewards and
punishments, will help.  You can call a punishment, love too, but not
many people can do that.  If you could, then you could say that it is
all God's love, even if we are assigned to the plant kingdom.  So, it
depends on how much we can accept God's will, ultimately.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What is the &quot;trifling of his favour?&quot;  It's the Master's grace.  If we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are smart, we will try to please the Master, to invoke his grace.

&gt; &gt;&gt; ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;hold it a fashion,&quot; mean?  Fashions come and go.  God comes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and goes.  Sometimes, he comes as a man, sometimes a woman.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sometimes, he comes as a very loving person.  Sometimes, he comes as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; strict taskmaster.  Sometimes, he gives the teachings clearly and to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the point.  Other times he gives them cryptically.  So, my point is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that God can come in various fashions.  He can come as a Chinaman, an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Arab, an Englishman, an Indian, or even an American.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That may be your point; Shakespeare's point appears to be very
&gt; &gt;&gt; different.  Hamlet has just been chastised by Claudius and Gertrude
&gt; &gt;&gt; for wearing mourning; Polonius is about to advise Laertes on how he
&gt; &gt;&gt; should dress while in France (falsely modest -- that's important:
&gt; &gt;&gt; people are watching); and Ophelia will, when her Dad leans on her,
&gt; &gt;&gt; object that he has importuned her with love &quot;in honorable fashion,&quot; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; which Polonius will reply, &quot;Ay, fashion you may call it!  Go to, go
&gt; &gt;&gt; to.&quot;

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; Hey, if you enjoy going off on tangents, that's your prerogative.
&gt; &gt; You're ignoring the points, which I clearly explained.  It's about
&gt; &gt; Hamlet's favor, or Hamlet's grace.  Your argument is relatively
&gt; &gt; meaningless.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What is at question is the extent to which appearance and performance
&gt; &gt;&gt; can be said to truly signify that which is within.

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; You want to question what is Hamlet's favor?  Okay, go for it.  Please
&gt; &gt; explain what you think it is, and stop beating around the bush.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There is nothing here about reincarnation or the divine embodiment.

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; Shakespeare has mentioned it in the canon.  He doesn't have to repeat
&gt; &gt; every lesson, that would defeat his purpose of writing cryptically.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;a toy in blood mean?&quot;  Obviously, a toy is something which
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; children enjoy.  So, we are like children before the Master.  We
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should enjoy his company while it lasts.  &quot;In blood,&quot; clearly means

&gt; &gt;&gt; ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;a violet in the youth of primy nature.&quot; mean?  It means
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the Master has a childhood, a youth, a middleage, an oldage, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a death.  Sometimes, his &quot;season,&quot; i.e. the time allotted to him by

&gt; &gt;&gt; ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;forward,&quot; mean, in this context?  It means that the Master
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is always looking forward to going back to the True Home.  It is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; place of unsurpassed beauty and peace.  He doesn't want to remain in

&gt; &gt;&gt; ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;not permanent,&quot; mean?  It means that he is not permanently
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with us.  The body will die and decompose one day, so we should take
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; advantage of the Master, while he is in the human form with us.

&gt; &gt;&gt; (!!)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does &quot;sweet, not lasting,&quot; mean?  It means that the time spent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with the Master is sweet, but it won't last.  That is why we need to

&gt; &gt;&gt; ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does the last line mean?  The perfume and suppliance of a minute,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no more?  It means that relatively speaking the Master will be gone
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shortly.  Vis-a-vis Eternity, the Master is only here for the blink of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an eye.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What does it mean when he tells his sis, a few lines later, &quot;best
&gt; &gt;&gt; safety lies in fear&quot;?

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; Conrad, I already commented on this.  If we fear God, then we won't
&gt; &gt; commit sins.  Simple.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What about when Laertes tells Ophelia in this same conversation that
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hamlet &quot;is himself subject to his birth,&quot; and therefore cannot, as
&gt; &gt;&gt; unvalued persons (like Laertes and Ophelia) &quot;carve for himself&quot;?

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; I already commented on this, too.  Master's are born with destinies,
&gt; &gt; also, but they are not as fixed as ours.  What that really means is
&gt; &gt; that the Master will take orders from the Father, or the Supreme
&gt; &gt; Being.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What about when he warns her against the possibility that her &quot;chaste
&gt; &gt;&gt; treasure&quot; be lost to his &quot;unmastered importunity&quot;?  Does that sound
&gt; &gt;&gt; very Buddha-like to you?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Conrad.

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; Yes, and I ALREADY commented on this.  Buddha could have been in the
&gt; &gt; same situation.  The Master wants the disciples to progress.  If they
&gt; &gt; refuse, then they don't take advantage of their treasure, which lies
&gt; &gt; within.  I don't remember exactly what I wrote.  You can check it.

&gt; &gt; Why would anyone want to fear God, that is the dumbest thing I have ever
&gt; &gt; heard in my life.

&gt; MM:
&gt; You want to diagree with Shakespeare and with all the Masters?  It's
&gt; your prerogative.

&gt; The wisest thing we can do is &quot;fear offending God.&quot;  God doesn't look
&gt; for excuses to punish us, but if we misuse the human form, he can take
&gt; it away.  Look around you.  Do you see the lower species?  Do you see
&gt; animals, birds, insects, water creatures, and plants?  Why are they in
&gt; that condition, and we are in this better condition?  Answer:  God's
&gt; will.  If we look analytically, we will see that humans are a tiny
&gt; percentage of all the life on this planet.  Humans are favored.  Who
&gt; gave them this favored status?  Answer:  God.  What God has given, he
&gt; can take away.  Christ said, &quot;He who ears to hear, let him hear, there
&gt; will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;  The architects of the
&gt; Christian Religion tried to edit out all the references to
&gt; reincarnation, but somehow, that one survived.  We should take it
&gt; seriously.

&gt; &gt; If you don't realize by now the love of God, why are you
&gt; &gt; even in yoga.

&gt; MM:
&gt; Are you serious?  If there is so much of God's love, then why are we
&gt; living in chaos?  It is obviously more of a punishment on earth, than
&gt; a paradise.  I think maybe you are living in fantasyland.  Try to look
&gt; at everything around you.  You should see that it is not all a
&gt; paradise.  People are starving everyday.  Is that the love of God?  Is
&gt; it a punishment?  Your contention raises too many questions, while my
&gt; contention is more logical.  Go into a prison and tell them about
&gt; God's love.  Go into a hospital full of terrminally ill people, and
&gt; thell them about God's love.

&gt; &gt; That's what yoga is all about, it is to show someone that God
&gt; &gt; is to be loved and not feared, in yoga don't have to believe all the
&gt; &gt; hearsay, which sounds like Christianity more than Buddhism.

&gt; MM:
&gt; I'm not saying to fear God, himself, but fear offending him.  If you
&gt; love someone you won't want to offend them.  That is the principle
&gt; behind it.  God is very lenient, very merciful, but if we offend him
&gt; too much, he could destroy a city, country, or even the whole planet.
&gt; This wholesale destruction has been called a dissolution, or on a
&gt; bigger scale, a grand dissolution.

&gt; &gt; &quot;best safety lies in fear&quot; to me this would be talking about anything except
&gt; &gt; God, because if God is in you and you are in God, then that's where the word
&gt; &gt; oneness come from,  there is no fear, you are at one!!

&gt; MM:
&gt; It's not just lip service.  It involves dismantling our ego, and
&gt; casting off all sinful habits.  We can't just say, prematurely, I'm
&gt; one with God, if we are still sinning everyday.  We should reach his
&gt; level, then we will know the difference between right and wrong.

&gt; Yoga means to unite.  We can try, with the help of a Master, to unite
&gt; with higher levels of consciousness.  God is available to human
&gt; beings, if we can qualify.  Living in fantasyland is not the answer.
&gt; Facing the reality, that this world is a MIXTURE of rewards and
&gt; punishments, will help.  You can call a punishment, love too, but not
&gt; many people can do that.  If you could, then you could say that it is
&gt; all God's love, even if we are assigned to the plant kingdom.  So, it
&gt; depends on how much we can accept God's will, ultimately.
