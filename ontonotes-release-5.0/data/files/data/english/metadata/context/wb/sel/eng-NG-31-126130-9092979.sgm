What is the alternate choice at #20, next to Thunder Road? Light of Day?
What else that would begin &quot;Li&quot;? Living Proof? (One of the Springtseen kids
was there, after the show Bruce and Patti were behind the stage with him,
doing the &quot;can hyou believe how tall he is?&quot; thing.

OK - now I see the Blinded up above. Thanks!

(nah, I liked Thunder Road. Now, Blinded instead of Working would have been
OK for me. Not so much for the 19000 who ate it up. Instead of Lonesome Day
would have been exceptional)

Yeah, that did sting a little bit, but really can't complain after the
Growin' Up &gt; Kitty's Back on N1.

And re the theory that maybe he leans toward Thunder Road when he sees
a younger crowd, that might've been part of the decision to go with
GITSClothes instead of Blinded for E1. It went over well, including
with the four girls that the video cam found twice, who looked 21-25
and were enjoying themselves.

The first time, the camera stayed with them until that inevitable
moment when one of the girls finally realized her face was on the big
screen. Fun.

Blinded was the alt to Thunder Road.  If you look at the setlist, the
slash indicating a choice in Bruce-speak is clearly next to Th Road
and not Girls.

They bumped into me. But we did have a blast back there. Not quite the
cartwheels that were going on in Philadelphia, but still fun.
