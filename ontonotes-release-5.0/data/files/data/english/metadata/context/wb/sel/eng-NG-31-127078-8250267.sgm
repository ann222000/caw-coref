American forces are tracking about 50 members of an elite
Iranian force likely to be designated a foreign terrorist
organization by the Bush administration are crossing the
border into southern Iraq to train Shiite militia fighters, a
top U.S. general said Sunday.

The claim that Iranian trainers were working inside Iraq was
issue by Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, whose command includes the
volatile southern rim of Baghdad and districts to the south.
Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
Iraq's borders.

&quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
have been arrested in his territory.

&quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the
Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
within Iraq's borders.

Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
progress report on Iraq.

But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
effective against US bases.

There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
Lynch said.

Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
henchmen had what it took. We never will.

Agreed, some of the people that want to govern the country by force a not
people yearning for democracy. But, can you claim with any authority at all
that the general population want to be ruled by those insurgents? If so, how
do you know that? How many of them have you spoken to? How many GIs have you
heard speak at your nearest Legion or VFW hall? How many of those letters on
the bulletin boards, telling of their interaction with the Iraqi people,
have you read. I suspect none. I suspect that all most people are paying
attention to is what the media wants them to know and ignoring what the
troops themselves are saying.

You know what? Our troops don't want to be over there. Hell, we didn't want
to be in WWII either, or Korea, Vietnam or anywhere else there is live fire.
But we go because that's what we signed up for. The fact that when we're
there we can be heard to say disparaging things about being there gives the
media the ammunition they are always looking for to paint the situation with
the worst mosaic possible. People need to understand that and stop being so
gullible to media hype.

I don't want us to be in the war in Iraq. I didn't want us to be in Kosovo,
Somalia, Grenada, Lebanon or anywhere else either. But, for once, finally,
maybe we have a fellow as CINC that is so obstinate and muleheaded that he
is not going to surrender and if that is the case, the future will bring us
closer to a time when terrorists think long and hard before they try to take
us on. We have been hit so many times since we surrendered Korea, and
continued surrendering every conflict we entered since, that this attempt to
change the way we leave a battle, as winners instead of losers, is a bit
refreshing to me. And, before you ask, yes, I lost a close relative in Iraq
and NO I don't want his death to count for nothing more than another time
American cut and ran.

Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&quot;surge&quot;:

To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
don’t you get insecurity.

There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
— Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
together.

Want to be ruled by them? Hell, they elected them! Shiites make up 60%
of the population of Iraq.  Together with the Kurds (who do their own
thing) Iraq is ruled by two Shiite Islamic parties. Oh and when I say
&quot;Islamic&quot;, I mean &quot;ISLAMIC&quot;!

1. The SCIRI: It's headed up by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. Hakim helped
found the party WHILE LIVING IN IRAN, and was the first head of it's
militia. Awhile back the US stormed his compound in Baghdad and
arrested two agents of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard -- the very
same Iranian organization that supplies IEDs to the &quot;insurgents&quot;, and
the one that Bush wants to label as terrorist!

2. The DAWA: Here's all you need to know. &quot;Moqtada Sadr has close ties
with the Islamic Dawa Party, which has ties to Iran. Many leaders of
the Dawa Party fled to Iran, and elsewhere, after the Persian Gulf War
where they remained in exile until the American invasion of Iraq in
2003. During this period, some of its factions moved to the SCIRI
party. After the invasion, both al-Dawa and SCIRI returned to Iraq.&quot;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi_Army

Guess which party our &quot;friend&quot; Maliki belongs to -- the DAWA. So we've
got The SCIRI headed up by a guy who is a former resident of Iran and
invites agents of Iranian terrorism into his home, and the Prime
Minister of Iraq, a guy who spent a good part of his life hiding out
in Iran and is widely regarded as a tool of Moqtada al Sadr. Oh yes,
and by the way, the DAWA is closely associated with Hezbollah in
Lebanon!

Did Bush bother mentioning who our &quot;partners&quot; would be when we threw
out Saddam? Did he even know?

JC, don't be a fool. Look at the facts. We have gotten ourselves on
the wrong side of a fight in which there is no good side. We are
carrying the water for Iran, and are too stubborn to admit it.  Why in
the Hell did we get ourselves into this mess?

Feel better?  Now, let's get back to the original subject, i.e.-Iranians in
Iraq.  I take it that you believe they have no right to be there to
proselytize Iraqis willing to do those things they'd do for themselves if
they were there?  Is that your position?

Because, if it is, please tell me how that differed from our position when
we sent our people into Afghanistan to arm and train the mujahadin when the

Jose, how do we &quot;win&quot; if the politicians we are fighting to keep in
power arrived in Iraq, straight from Tehran, a week after we got
there? At least Saddam wasn't cozy with the Iranians. We were defeated

he made a commitment to help end violence, &quot;We have gone a
long way to establish a democratic and pluralistic society in
Iraq.... We...[believe in] a government that deals and will

Al-Hakim also gave his assessment of the situation in Iraq:
&quot;The Iraqi situation has been subjected to a great deal of
defamation, and the true picture is not being presented in
order to show a dark side of what's happening in Iraq. We see
the attempts to defame and distort the situation in Iraq not
taking into consideration the democratic steps that that
country has taken, writing the constitution and establishing a
state that depends heavily on the constitution, that it is
unified and that it is strong. There are attempts to show the
sectarian strife in an attempt to weaken the position in Iraq.&quot;

Here's a little tip about Muslims. Lying to Infidels is perfectly OK.
In fact, it has become an art form in the Middle East.

Read this Washington Post article published 25 days after al-Hakim
whispered his lies in Bush's ear.

Jeff - I, too, was a sucker for the Iraq war - for reasons I have listed

the Middle East.&quot;  How absolutely true.  Just one look, for instance, at
Saudi Arabia, with whom we are &quot;pussy-footing' and so are they with us -
supposedly - all the while doing nothing to stop their teaching of
Wahhabism!!  That tells you something!!!
Our misadventure in Iraq - at the cost of thousands of lives of our
young men - will go down in history as even far worse than the Vietnam
war.  Bush should have known - or should have been advised that the
Iraqi people seemingly can only be held &quot;together' in peace, by the
cruel, forceful,murderous hands of someone like Saddam - but NOT by
democracy!!!   I Suppose it might have, indeed, been possible, that,
eventally, Saddam would have  acquired nuclear capabilities, and
threatened (attacked) us, and that was a sensible rationale for trying
to oust him.  But, even had we done so - and we did - , after getting
rid of him, we shoujld have withdrawn - right then, and leave the rest
of to them. They DID vote - of sorts - but, since then, it has been
downhill all the way - as it has been for them since time immemorial -
and we are paying a high price to change that pattern!!!! What kind of a
record does this represent for us, here??!!  (Vietnam - Iraq - what's
next??!!)
We are electing the wrong leaders.

&gt; Jose, how do we &quot;win&quot; if the politicians we are fighting to keep in
&gt; power arrived in Iraq, straight from Tehran, a week after we got
&gt; there? At least Saddam wasn't cozy with the Iranians. We were defeated

&gt;&gt; wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt; American forces are tracking about 50 members of an elite
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian force likely to be designated a foreign terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt; organization by the Bush administration are crossing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; border into southern Iraq to train Shiite militia fighters, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; top U.S. general said Sunday.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The claim that Iranian trainers were working inside Iraq was
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue by Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, whose command includes the
&gt;&gt;&gt; volatile southern rim of Baghdad and districts to the south.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt; allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq's borders.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
&gt;&gt;&gt; citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arrested in his territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.

&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
">

I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jose, I was a sucker and supported this war. Don't be an even bigger
&gt;&gt;&gt; sucker than I was.

&gt;&gt; You may not believe Muslims when they say they will cleanse
&gt;&gt; the earth of all infidels, but I do.

&gt;If you're that delusional, you need some serious help.  They're a minority
&gt;in the world and they have neither the resources nor the skill nor the
&gt;capability and, regardless of your opinion, probably don't even have an
&gt;overriding desire to wipe out everybody else in the world.

They don't want to cleanse you, George. They would rather you just
converted, and saved them the trouble. They did their best at the
Battle of Poitiers in 732 and the Battle of Vienna in 1683, and
failed. Now they're back. Where swords failed them, fertility, law
suits, and immigration might just succeed.

BTW -- At 1.6 billion, Islam isn't exactly a minor religion, and with
a grip on enough of the world's oil production to bring the West to
it's knees, they are not without resources. Their real skill, however,
is in manipulating Western media and political systems. Believe it or
not, they are actually able to fool many ignorant ill informed
Westerners into believing that Islam is a minority in the world, with
neither the resources nor the skill nor the capability to manipulate
the West into dhimmitude.

&gt;&gt; Jose, how do we &quot;win&quot; if the politicians we are fighting to keep in

&gt;You want to give up, not I. Tell me how pulling out will

It won't prevent our destruction, but staying won't either. How many
Muslim fundamentalists have become moderates because of our occupation
of Iraq?  How do we benefit when we waste the lives of American
soldiers defending Iran's proxies in Iraq? That's just plain dumb. If
we want to do something useful we should severely curtail Muslim
immigration, cut off foreign funding of mosques and Islamic
institutes, deport every Muslim we can legally kick out of the
country, assassinate, and/or torture and imprison every Jihadi we can
lay our hands on, and get serious about reducing, and ultimately
eliminating, our dependence on foreign oil.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American forces are tracking about 50 members of an elite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian force likely to be designated a foreign terrorist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organization by the Bush administration are crossing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; border into southern Iraq to train Shiite militia fighters, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; top U.S. general said Sunday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The claim that Iranian trainers were working inside Iraq was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue by Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, whose command includes the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; volatile southern rim of Baghdad and districts to the south.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq's borders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arrested in his territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.

&gt;&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt;&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt;&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt;&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt;&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt;&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt;&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt;&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt;&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt;&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt;&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt;&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt;&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt;&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt;&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.

&gt;I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.
">

Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

They're illegal and we're not?  I don't recall any part of the existing
Iraqi Government at the time inviting us to come and visit, much less than
to stay.

Do I need to remind you that we're there because we chose to chase the Holy
Grail (WMDs) which to date we have yet to find?  We're uninvited (and
illegal visa-less) guests to the Iraqis and they'd sooner be rid of us than
have us hanging around whatever their ilk, with the possible exceptions of
the smallest of their minorities, the Kurds.

Simple.....if we pull out we won't be there to be destroyed.  The only
infidels that they're destroying right now are those young people wearing
our uniforms who appear in their snipers' sights and who drive over the IEDs
they've set alongside their roads.  The killing will stop as soon as our
people (their favorite targets) disappear.  From that point on, if they want
to continue their favorites sport of killing human beings, they're going to
be restricted to using other Iraqis with whom they have political
differences of opinions as targets.

If you're going to worry about them coming after us to kill us all, you'd be
better advised to worry about the other 6 billion Muslims in the world
because they don't like us either, and they haven't been involved in trying
to get electricity into their homes for more than a couple of hours a day or
safe water to drink or cook with as the Iraqis currently have.

Poor Jose.....unlike Jeff, he doesn't have the moral fiber necessary to
admit that he made a horrendous mistake in swallowing the fairy tales that
the government put on his plate.  So he keeps on denying the obvious and
babbling the old party line which has long been discarded even by the party
that put it out originally.  Nobody likes to admit that they were gullible
and he's the perfect example of someone who'd rather remain in denial than
admit the obvious.  It's more than he can handle and he's just not big
enough to be able to do it.....there aren't too many guys like Jeff around
and poor Jose is sure as hell not one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; there? At least Saddam wasn't cozy with the Iranians. We were defeated
&gt;&gt;&gt; the day we were dumb enough to set foot in that Hell Hole. And that's
&gt;&gt;&gt; not propaganda -- it's the unvarnished truth.

&gt;&gt; You want to give up, not I. Tell me how pulling out will
&gt;&gt; prevent the destruction of us infidels?

&gt;Simple.....if we pull out we won't be there to be destroyed.  The only
&gt;infidels that they're destroying right now are those young people wearing
&gt;our uniforms who appear in their snipers' sights and who drive over the IEDs
&gt;they've set alongside their roads.  The killing will stop as soon as our
&gt;people (their favorite targets) disappear.  From that point on, if they want
&gt;to continue their favorites sport of killing human beings, they're going to
&gt;be restricted to using other Iraqis with whom they have political
&gt;differences of opinions as targets.

&gt;If you're going to worry about them coming after us to kill us all, you'd be
&gt;better advised to worry about the other 6 billion Muslims in the world
&gt;because they don't like us either, and they haven't been involved in trying
&gt;to get electricity into their homes for more than a couple of hours a day or
&gt;safe water to drink or cook with as the Iraqis currently have.

Actually, George, it's 1.6 billion, and just for the record our
soldiers may be their favorite target, but they kill far more of their
own people than they kill of ours. Just last week in one day they
killed 400 Yazidi. You can be sure that the killing will continue
whether we stay or go. It will only end when the combatants are
physically separated, or someone is perceived to have won.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt; &gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt; &gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt; &gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt; &gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt; &gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt; &gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.

&gt; &gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt; &gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt; &gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt; &gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt; &gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt; &gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt; &gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt; &gt; don't you get insecurity.

&gt; &gt; There's only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt; &gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt; &gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt; &gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt; &gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt; &gt; such an Iraq - without U.S. troops.

&gt; &gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt; &gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt; &gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt; &gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt; &gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt; &gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt; &gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt; &gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt; &gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt; &gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt; &gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt; &gt; - Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt; &gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt; &gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt; &gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won't work
&gt; &gt; together.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.

&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility ... and in the long
&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.

This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;&gt;&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.

&gt;&gt; Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
&gt;&gt; various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
&gt;&gt; theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
&gt;&gt; rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
&gt;&gt; their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
&gt;&gt; they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

&gt;This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
&gt;returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?
">

That wasn't the same Democrat congressman who thought al Qaeda was a
bunch of Shiites was it? In any case, the Surge will work when it
starts turning Muslims into Presbyterians, when it prevents al Qaeda
from killing 400 Yazidis in one day, when the Shiite militias are
disbanded, and when 50,000 AK47's hidden under the floors of Anbar get
turned into the police. Don't hold your breath.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're that delusional, you need some serious help.  They're a

&gt;&gt;&gt; in the world and they have neither the resources nor the skill nor the

&gt;&gt;&gt; George Z.

&gt;&gt; Most people woke up and changed their attitude after 9/11.

&gt; Like I said, you're delusional and you need some serious help.  YOU think
&gt; that way because your govenment told you to think that way but there are a
&gt; helluva lot of Americans out there who don't buy into that fairy tale, well
&gt; over half by most accounts.  Everybody's outta step but you and the

I have no idea of his level of understanding of Iraq. I'd be more
impressed if he had discussed how the various Iraqi factions can be
persuaded to reconcile their differences and stop fighting with each
other.

Do you have a plan for that, by the way?

Absolutely everyone agrees that if they don't, there can be no
peaceful solution for Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; border into southern Iraq to train Shiite militia fighters, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; top U.S. general said Sunday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The claim that Iranian trainers were working inside Iraq was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue by Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, whose command includes the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; volatile southern rim of Baghdad and districts to the south.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq's borders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arrested in his territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and

Hmmmm.  Here's what the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan
Crocker, said only today -- be sure not to miss the part
where he said U.S. support is not open ended.  Guess you
differ with that.  Just in on Reuters News:

Iraq Political Progress &quot;Extremely Disappointing&quot;

Iraq has made &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; progress toward reconciling
its warring sects, the U.S. ambassador said on Tuesday, just three
weeks before he is due to present a pivotal report on Iraq to the U.S.
Congress.

In some of the bluntest language used by a U.S. official toward Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki's fractured coalition government, ambassador
Ryan Crocker also warned that U.S. support for Maliki's administration
was not open-ended.

&quot;Progress on national level issues has been extremely disappointing
and frustrating to all concerned, to us, to Iraqis, to the Iraqi
leadership itself,&quot; Crocker said.

&quot;We do expect results, as do the Iraqi people, and our support is not
a blank check,&quot; he told reporters in Baghdad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The claim that Iranian trainers were working inside Iraq was

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq's borders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arrested in his territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no idea of his level of understanding of Iraq. I'd be more
&gt;&gt;&gt; impressed if he had discussed how the various Iraqi factions can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; persuaded to reconcile their differences and stop fighting with each
&gt;&gt;&gt; other.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a plan for that, by the way?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely everyone agrees that if they don't, there can be no
&gt;&gt;&gt; peaceful solution for Iraq.

&gt;&gt; Give Iraq's political leaders time to reach a political
&gt;&gt; accommodation and reconcile the warring sides.

&gt; Hmmmm.  Here's what the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan
&gt; Crocker, said only today -- be sure not to miss the part
&gt; where he said U.S. support is not open ended.  Guess you
&gt; differ with that.  Just in on Reuters News:

&gt; Iraq Political Progress &quot;Extremely Disappointing&quot;

&gt; Iraq has made &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; progress toward reconciling
&gt; its warring sects, the U.S. ambassador said on Tuesday, just three
&gt; weeks before he is due to present a pivotal report on Iraq to the U.S.
&gt; Congress.

&gt; In some of the bluntest language used by a U.S. official toward Prime
&gt; Minister Nuri al-Maliki's fractured coalition government, ambassador
&gt; Ryan Crocker also warned that U.S. support for Maliki's administration
&gt; was not open-ended.

&gt; &quot;Progress on national level issues has been extremely disappointing
&gt; and frustrating to all concerned, to us, to Iraqis, to the Iraqi
&gt; leadership itself,&quot; Crocker said.

&gt; &quot;We do expect results, as do the Iraqi people, and our support is not
&gt; a blank check,&quot; he told reporters in Baghdad.

Did someone say the struggle to reconcile Iraq's many cultural
differences would be easy?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no idea of his level of understanding of Iraq. I'd be more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impressed if he had discussed how the various Iraqi factions can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persuaded to reconcile their differences and stop fighting with each
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a plan for that, by the way?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely everyone agrees that if they don't, there can be no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peaceful solution for Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Give Iraq's political leaders time to reach a political
&gt;&gt;&gt; accommodation and reconcile the warring sides.

&gt;&gt; Hmmmm.  Here's what the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan
&gt;&gt; Crocker, said only today -- be sure not to miss the part
&gt;&gt; where he said U.S. support is not open ended.  Guess you
&gt;&gt; differ with that.  Just in on Reuters News:

&gt;&gt; Iraq Political Progress &quot;Extremely Disappointing&quot;

&gt;&gt; Iraq has made &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; progress toward reconciling
&gt;&gt; its warring sects, the U.S. ambassador said on Tuesday, just three
&gt;&gt; weeks before he is due to present a pivotal report on Iraq to the U.S.
&gt;&gt; Congress.

&gt;&gt; In some of the bluntest language used by a U.S. official toward Prime
&gt;&gt; Minister Nuri al-Maliki's fractured coalition government, ambassador
&gt;&gt; Ryan Crocker also warned that U.S. support for Maliki's administration
&gt;&gt; was not open-ended.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Progress on national level issues has been extremely disappointing
&gt;&gt; and frustrating to all concerned, to us, to Iraqis, to the Iraqi
&gt;&gt; leadership itself,&quot; Crocker said.

&gt;&gt; &quot;We do expect results, as do the Iraqi people, and our support is not
&gt;&gt; a blank check,&quot; he told reporters in Baghdad.

&gt;Did someone say the struggle to reconcile Iraq's many cultural
&gt;differences would be easy?
">

Joe, I suspect there is no intention on the part of the Shiites to
reconcile anything. For 800 years they've been screwed by the Sunnis,
and now it's pay back time. I suspect what's happening is that they
are stringing us along, while their army, Interior Ministry police,
and militias get better trained and equipped. At some point they will
want us to leave, and don't be surprised if the militias shoot at us
on the way out. Meanwhile, they're more than content to see us kill
their enemies for them. But, are we their friends for life? Nope,
we're just Infidels. So, what are we doing there propping up the Iraqi
allies of Iran? Beats me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said his troops are tracking about 50 members of Iran's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revolutionary Guard Corps in their area - the first detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allegation that Iranians have been training fighters within
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq's borders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We know they're here and we target them as well,&quot; he said,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citing intelligence reports as evidence of their presence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He declined to be more specific and said no Iranian forces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arrested in his territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We've got about 50 of those,&quot; he said, referring to the

Yes, quite a few people did but not the Bushies.  They thought it
would be a walk in the park once Saddam was out of the picture.
Remember &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;?

And the differences are not cultural they are religious.  And go
back many centuries. Didn't you know that?  Seems a lot you don't
know Joe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iranian forces. &quot;They go back and forth. There's a porous border.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The military has stepped up allegations against Iran in recent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks, saying it supplies militants with arms and training to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attack U.S. forces, but Lynch's comments were the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed allegation that Iranians have been training fighters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within Iraq's borders.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beginning to get the idea, Joe? When we invaded Iraq we opened a can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of worms we couldn't begin to imagine. Who are we fighting in Iraq,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why? Just one more insurgency to put down? These are not people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yearning for democracy. These are religious fanatics and petty tribal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tyrants that will never be controlled in their own part of the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a bunch of Infidels, and Kaffirs. Saddam knew how to do it. He and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his army, and his secret police, and sadistic sons, and murderous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; henchmen had what it took. We never will.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thomas Friedman, writing yesterday in the NY Times said of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;surge&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is good news if the number of Iraqis found dead in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baghdad each night is diminishing. Indeed, it is good news if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; casualties are down everywhere that U.S. troops have made their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presence felt. But all that tells me is something that was obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the start of the war, which Donald Rumsfeld ignored: where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put in large numbers of U.S. troops you get security, and where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t you get insecurity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s only one thing at this stage that would truly impress me, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is this: proof that there is an Iraq, proof that there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coalition of Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds who share our vision of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unified, multiparty, power-sharing, democratizing Iraq and who are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to forge a social contract that will allow them to maintain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such an Iraq — without U.S. troops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because if that is not the case, even if U.S. troops create more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
&gt;&gt;&gt; returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?

&gt;&gt; I have no idea of his level of understanding of Iraq. I'd be more
&gt;&gt; impressed if he had discussed how the various Iraqi factions can be
&gt;&gt; persuaded to reconcile their differences and stop fighting with each
&gt;&gt; other.

&gt;&gt; Do you have a plan for that, by the way?

&gt;By the way, what is your plan?
">

I doubt they can be persuaded but we can't wait around for them
to decide to do so.  So give them a date and if nothing changes
substantially leave Iraq in an orderly but determined manner.

Even Ryan Crocker said &quot;U.S. support is &quot;not a blank check.

That is what you seem to be willing to give the Iraqis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets of security via the surge, they will have no one to hand these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pockets to who can maintain them without us. In other words, the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who can prove that the surge is working are the Iraqis, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way they prove that is by showing that violence is down in areas where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no U.S. troops or where U.S. troops have come and gone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because many Americans no longer believe anything President Bush says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Iraq, he has outsourced the assessment of the surge to the firm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Petraeus &amp; Crocker. But this puts them in an impossible position. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admire their efforts, and those of their soldiers, to try to salvage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something decent in Iraq, especially when you see who we are losing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — Sunni suicide jihadists and Shiite militants, who murder fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Muslims by the dozen and whose retrograde visions offer Iraqis only a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future of tears. But we could never defeat them on our own. It takes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; village, and right now too many of the Iraqi villagers won’t work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch, whose mission is to block the flow of weapons and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fighters into the Baghdad area, said Sunni and Shiite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremists have become increasingly aggressive this month in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bid to influence the debate in Washington before a pivotal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; progress report on Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But he singled out the Shiite extremists as being behind an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptick in attacks using armor-piercing explosively formed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penetrators, or EFPs, which he said were largely assembled in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq from parts smuggled in from Iran. He also noted a marked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in Iranian-rockets that have been increasingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effective against US bases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There has been an overall decrease in attacks against US and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraqi forces, as well as civilians, south of Baghdad, but 46
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of those were being carried out by Shiite extremists,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynch said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the consequences of pulling back precipitously would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be potentially catastrophic for the Iraqi people themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to whom we have a tremendous responsibility … and in the long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run chaotic for the region as a whole and for our own security.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are the Iraq people?  Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds?  One of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various sects of Shiites with their militias or the Sunnis with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs?  If they stopped doing violence to each other, getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rid of Al Queda would be a cake walk. But they bicker and support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their various armed and militant groups -- and if you deny they do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they you are living in total ignorance of what goes on there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This opinion came from a Democratic Congressman after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returning from his fifth visit to Iraq.  Is he totally ignorant?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no idea of his level of understanding of Iraq. I'd be more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impressed if he had discussed how the various Iraqi factions can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persuaded to reconcile their differences and stop fighting with each
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a plan for that, by the way?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely everyone agrees that if they don't, there can be no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peaceful solution for Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give Iraq's political leaders time to reach a political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accommodation and reconcile the warring sides.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmmm.  Here's what the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan
&gt;&gt;&gt; Crocker, said only today -- be sure not to miss the part
&gt;&gt;&gt; where he said U.S. support is not open ended.  Guess you
&gt;&gt;&gt; differ with that.  Just in on Reuters News:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq Political Progress &quot;Extremely Disappointing&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq has made &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; progress toward reconciling
&gt;&gt;&gt; its warring sects, the U.S. ambassador said on Tuesday, just three
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks before he is due to present a pivotal report on Iraq to the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Congress.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In some of the bluntest language used by a U.S. official toward Prime
&gt;&gt;&gt; Minister Nuri al-Maliki's fractured coalition government, ambassador
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ryan Crocker also warned that U.S. support for Maliki's administration
&gt;&gt;&gt; was not open-ended.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Progress on national level issues has been extremely disappointing
&gt;&gt;&gt; and frustrating to all concerned, to us, to Iraqis, to the Iraqi
&gt;&gt;&gt; leadership itself,&quot; Crocker said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We do expect results, as do the Iraqi people, and our support is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; a blank check,&quot; he told reporters in Baghdad.

&gt;&gt; Did someone say the struggle to reconcile Iraq's many cultural
&gt;&gt; differences would be easy?

&gt; Yes, quite a few people did but not the Bushies.  They thought it
&gt; would be a walk in the park once Saddam was out of the picture.
