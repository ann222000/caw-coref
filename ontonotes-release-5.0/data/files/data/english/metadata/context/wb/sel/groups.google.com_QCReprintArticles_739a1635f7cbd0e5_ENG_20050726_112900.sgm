Easy as 1-2-3 RSS for Your DeskTop, WebSite and Visitors Or How I Fell Victim to RSS
Copyright © 2005 Kathy Sparks
Your Virtual Resource

Since the acronym, &quot;RSS&quot; first crept into my email box, my
curiosity heightened to such a level that I finally fell victim
to the dreaded bug – I HAD to know what it was about, why all of
the interest and mostly how to make it work for me, the not so
technical wannabe. After all, it's supposed to help your online
marketing effort, your search engine ranking and boost your web
traffic.

As always for me when researching, one thing leads to another and
that leads to countless hours of reading about it, frustration
and knowing I could never be technical enough to understand the
whys and the coding and making it work without paying. Oh, did
I forget to tell you, I would rather spend countless hours
figuring something out than purchase it to be done. After all,
if I don't get anything out of it, I don't want to spend money
on it and if there is something to be learned, I want to be the
person learning. So there you have it, the victim goes on a
mission.

I decided I needed to break this down into understandable
categories and choose the subjects that might be applicable most
for my online marketing and virtual assistant web site. So here
they are:

1. I want RSS on my Desktop
2. I want RSS Feeds on my WebSite
3. I want to be able to build RSS Feeds of my information for
others to put on their web sites.

Well, that simplifies it rather nicely. So for the past three
months I've worked out a little procedure to do just that. This
article would be way too long to explain everything, so I've
created a mini email ecourse explaining just where to go for
resources and how do put a feed on your desktop, how to put a
feed on your web site and yes, you also can create your own
feeds all very inexpensively. You'll find the sign up form at
http://www.yourvirtualresource.com  so that you don't have to wade
through all of the techie stuff and you too will achieve &quot;RSS.&quot;
