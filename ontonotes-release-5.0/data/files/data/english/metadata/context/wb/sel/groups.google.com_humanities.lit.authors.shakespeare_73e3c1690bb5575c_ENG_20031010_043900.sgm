______________________________________________________

The Stratfordian candidate did not write the
Shakespeare works because he spoke in the
Wessex dialect, a heavily inflected Anglo-Saxon
dialect of midwest England well outside the Danelaw.

The author of the Shakespeare works is required
to have spoken the English dialect of the Danelaw.

It's hard to believe that philologists haven't known
this dirty little Strat secret and in fact I found two philogists
who implied that the Strats have a problem but launched
into the usual diversionary tactic to 'protect the reputation
of the National Poet.'

So far as Shake-speare's own speech is concerned, it
must be remembered that part of the evidence for it is
debatable. Shakespeare may well have carried over
idiosyncrasies of the Warwickshire dialect into his
literary works. Moreover, the cultured speech of his
day was less unified, less subject to strict standards
than it was to become later on, especially in the 18th
century, when schoolmasters and lexicographers assumed
the role of arbiters of correctness. In the period
about the year 1600 there were still a number of
possibilities of choice among equally &quot;correct&quot; forms,
because conservative and advanced pronunciations could
be heard side by side, as well as competing dialect
forms and even vulgarisms which were . . . . . . . .

That's at least seven excuses. Strats never stop
trying to cover the First Stratfordian's ass.

Wessex was actually southern, not midwestern England.
Midwestern England was Mercia, which indeed would include Warwickshire.
These identities - Wessex, Mercia, Danelaw - are well-submerged by
Shakespeare's time, and although dialect does preserve elements of their
tongue, to describe it as 'Anglo-Saxon' in the 16th century seems a little
dubious.

Why? My understanding is that there is evidence of Warwickshire dialect in
the plays.
Can someone from either side of this argument show the specific words -
Warwickshire or East Midlands (what EW calls Danelaw dialect) - that are
used?

Can you tell us what features of Shakespeare's language are characteristic
only of dialects within the former Danelaw? Was the 16th century Stratford
dialect really West Saxon in origin, or did it owe at least as much to
Mercian? Who are the authorities on whom you rely for this linguistic
information?

Hwaet ('listen') -- &quot;Shakespeare Sounded Like Beowulf&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------
THE GOLDEN ASS

The charge to the reader: intende (lit. 'be attentive') -- rather like
the beginning of the first English epic Beowulf : Hwaet ('listen') --
is a much more demanding commencement than 'once upon a time...'
It requests the reader to be an active participant in experiencing the
tale, not simply a passive listerner (Apuleius's style throughout is
consistent with this notion). The Latin statement, in fact, is a
conditional: 'if you are attentive, then you shall take pleasure',
suggesting that the reader's enjoyment depends upon
the degree of attention paid to the tale.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Anglo-Saxon antiquarian Laurence Nowell
was Edward deVere's (1563) tutor.

&lt;&lt;Oxford was tutored in Latin by Lawrence Nowell, collector of
antiquities and Old English manuscripts, owner of the original
and unique manuscripts of BEOWULF [&amp; JUDITH], and brother of
ALEXANDER NOWELL, Dean of St. Paul's.&gt;&gt; - Stephanie Caruana

1 - The Wonders of the East
2 - ALEXANDER's Letter to Aristotle

5 - JUDITH [=&gt; JUDITH Shakspere]

&lt;&lt;The Wyvern Dragon: Vicious &amp; virulent, it was greatly feared
for the pestilence it brought to Nothern Europe, Greece &amp;
Ethiopia. The Wyvern had a coiling trunk that bore a pair
of eagle's legs, which were tucked beneath it's wings.
It was usually green with a red underside.

&lt;&lt;Alan Young's _Tudor &amp; Jacobean Tournaments_ ... recounts Oxford's
participation in one of his last tournaments (prior to his imprisonment
in the Tower), at Whitehall, on 22 January 1581. The circumstance of
this contest was the Earl of Arundel's &quot;friendly&quot; challenge to knightly
gallants as one Callophisus, a Lover of Beauty, to which challenge
responded, among others, Lord Windsor, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir William
DRURY, and Lord Oxford. Young tells us that all of the respondents
to Arundel's challenge at Whitehall styled themselves, rather
unpretentiously (save one!), by such unimaginative nomenclature as the
Red Knight, the White Knight, and the Blue Knight-- but, according
to Young, &quot;the Earl of Oxford appeared in the Whitehall tiltyard
as the Knight of the Tree of the Sun . . .&quot;&gt;&gt;

January 22, 1571, Sir Robert Cotton born. He is noted for collecting
ancient MSS and shelving them under busts of Roman emperors.
The abbreviation Cotton Vitellius AXV, known by students of British
literature, indicates the location of the Beowulf MS in his library.
The MS and a bust of Sir Robert are in the British Museum.
His political leanings landed him in trouble with King Charles I,
who had his library confiscated.

January 22, 1775, André-Marie Ampère born

January 22, 1788, Lord Byron born at his father's rooms on Halles
Street in London's fashionable Mayfair section. His mother had ridden at
Captain Byron's insistence from Aberdeen so that his son could be born
on English soil. The poet's mother said that this prenatal coach ride
accounted for her son's malformed leg. Another theory is that as a
prudish Scottish lady she demanded that the attending physician use what
was called a birthing tent, a black sheet that preserved the woman's
modesty but made the doctor literally work in the dark. The nature
of Byron's physical impairment has always been mysterious, because
prosthetic devices for both legs were found after his death,
none of them indicating malformation.

January 22, 1816, Lord Byron's &quot;Parisina&quot;&amp;&quot;The Siege of Corinth.&quot;

I'm an only child. We seek inattention.

And Strats have a big problem, Reedy.

East Midland dialect (also called East Anglian-Oxford-
Cambridge-Chancery-London-Chaucerian-Shakespearean
English) developed inside the Danelaw but unfortunately
for Strats, your guy spoke a Saxon (Wessex, West Midland)
dialogue. Stratford was well outside the Danelaw.

Neverthess we are supposed to believe
that the Stratford Butcher rolled into town from
Warwickshire with his heavily-inflected Germanic
dialect--Londoners couldn't even understand
the Warwickshire dialect--and whipped out the
Venus and Adonis in pure East Midlands university
English.

It didn't happen, Reedy.

Then it's all Nowell's fault. Anglo-Saxon (actually
Saxon) is totally unlike the dialect of the
Shakespeare plays. The Shakespeare dialect is
more properly Anglo-Scandanavian--a term that
some ME scholars are starting to use according to
an article in History Today I was just reading. The
Angles were the 'southerners' in Denmark.

I was comparing Bacon's turf inside the Denlaw
with Oxford's. Have you ever looked Hedingham
up on a map? It was just west of Colchester on the
English Channel in an area thick with Danish settlements.
The Veres are supposed to have a Danish line. It's
obvious that Oxford's dialect problem was due to the
fact that he just lived too far away from the culture,
centers.

Colchester was so far from London and the universities
that the gentry probably spoke the same dialect as
the lower classes. I was just reading that the gentry
would speak one dialect in London but slip into the local
provincial dialects at home. Oxford's problem was that
he only had one dialect.

&gt;&gt; THE GOLDEN ASS

&gt;&gt; The charge to the reader: intende (lit. 'be attentive') -- rather like
&gt;&gt; the beginning of the first English epic Beowulf : Hwaet ('listen') --
&gt;&gt; is a much more demanding commencement than 'once upon a time...'
&gt;&gt; It requests the reader to be an active participant in experiencing the
&gt;&gt; tale, not simply a passive listerner (Apuleius's style throughout is
&gt;&gt; consistent with this notion). The Latin statement, in fact, is a
&gt;&gt; conditional: 'if you are attentive, then you shall take pleasure',
&gt;&gt; suggesting that the reader's enjoyment depends upon
&gt;&gt; the degree of attention paid to the tale.

_The Raven's Story_ by Peter Veale

Swaggerin' home in raven fashion, feelin' rather bold and dashin',
Thought I'd do some poet-bashin'; saw this light above a door -
A sign that E.A. Poe was porin' o'er some problem bleak and borin',
Like how to rhyme with Ulalume, or find a maiden named Lenore.
And when I heard the morbid nutter mutter, 'Oh my lost Lenore!'
I tapped my beak against his door.

Presently the joyless mortal opened up his gloomy portal,
Eyed me with misgiving and inquired what was my visit for.
I said I was a poor old raven, tuckered out and seekin' haven;
Could I rest awhile upon the bust of Pallas o'er his door?
'The bust? Well, if you must,' he answered, clearly shaken to the core,
'But what news have you of Lenore?'

'By Jeez,' I mused, 'by flamin' golly, this man is clearly off his trolley;
I'll play upon his melancholy as I perch above his door.'
I said: 'Dear Brother Poe, I'm sorry I cannot really ease your worry
Except for some reward which you might bring from your provision store.
A piece of steak would do me nicely - even offal if you're poor.
Oh, then I might remember more.'

'Corrupt and greedy bird!' he chided. 'Is my sorrow thus derided?
One who's lost a love, as I did, on the Night's Plutonian shore,
Regards your attitude as callous, so please quit the bust of Pallas,
Where you seem quite disposed to stay for half the dreary night or more;
Then pray be good enough to clean the raven-droppings from the floor
Before you're banished from my door.'

I stared him out and wouldn't waver. (Clean up the floor? Do me a favour!)
So finally I got to savour some small offerings from his store.
He fed me, but I kept on stallin'; told him I was past recallin'
Anything of his fair maiden, anything of lost Lenore.
I broke the wretched fellow's spirit with my croaks of 'Nevermore',
And I'm immortalized for sure.

&gt;&quot;heavily-inflected Germanic dialect&quot; here? What meaning (if any) do you
&gt; attach to the word &quot;inflected&quot;?

"/>

In my first post I thought it meant:

noun: the patterns of stress and intonation in a language.

The 'patterns of stress and intonation' in OE and some of these
dialects have, in fact, been reconstructed by modern scholars so when
Webb came ranting in with his panties in a wad he might have asked
what sense of inflection I meant.

Both kinds of inflection influenced the formation of modern
English which has Danish, not German, stress and intonation
in both England and the US. New England was settled
by Puritans from East Anglia who spoke the East Midland Danelaw
dialect and in the US their dialect became the 'prestige English.'

Here's the chart for feminine pronouns, some of which
look like masculine pronouns but are not.

OE Nth. EMdl. WMdl. SthW. Kt.
Singular
Nom. hio &quot;she&quot; scho sche scho heo, he heo, he
heo ? ho he, ho ho, hui ho, hui hie hue hi hi
Plural
Nom. heo, hie thai, they thai, they thai, they hi, heo hi, hy
hehi heo here
Gen. hire thair hyr, here hor, hur hor, hure hare, hire
theyr,her here here
Dat. 1 him thaym hem, them hem, hom hem, ham hem,ham
heom theym heom hom

The chart is from Schlauch and Naukowe I cited above whose
work minutely dissects the inflectional grammars of OE and ME and
the regional dialects thereof. I can't provide a link because
it's from a book.

What is interesting in Schlauch and Naukowe are the
changes in East Midlands versus West Midlands. I can find
better examples but you can see that East Midlands--Bacon's
turf--has found 'she,' 'them' and 'here' while East Midlands--
the Stratford Butcher's turf--has 'they' and 'hur.' Cornish and
Kentish are already fading from the field.

This chart, of course, is just *an example* of inflections and
doesn't begin to show how far the 'double Danish' East Midlands
dialect changed 'Anglo-Saxon' inflections. The Anglians that were
settled within the Danelaw at the time of the treaty were formerly
southern Danes/Northern Germans who could more or less
communicate with the Danes while the heavily-inflected Germanic
Wessex dialect-speakers could not communicate with the Danes
and could barely communicate with their ex-enemies the Anglians
who only became their friends during the period of the Viking
invasions.

Wessex was the political entity that remained to the west and
south of England after the Danelaw treaty of 886 and of course
the West Midlands Stratford butcher spoke a heavily-inflected
(in both senses) Wessex dialect and could not have written the
Shakespeare plays.

If Nelson is going to disqualify Oxford for speaking and writing
an East Midlands dialect (which Nelson incorrectly refers to as
'East Anglian') then how much more should Nelson disqualify
the Germanic West Midland dialect of the Stratford Butcher???

And how 'bout an answer to the question of how the Stratford
butcher with a dialect nearly incomprehensible to Londoners could
possibly have written the Venus and Adonis in superb university
English right after he came to town?

Post your theory below, Groves.

In linguistics, inflection means changing a word form (often the suffix) to
indicate grammatical changes, e.g. she becomes here; seebecomes saw, seeing,
etc.; see

The definition you give doesn't, apparentlym exist anywhere. If you look up
inflect in the OED, it defines it as: to vary the termination of (a word) in

No, Lizzie's definition is certainly a legitimate one. I'm feeling too

As we only have written records to help us reconstruct how people were
speaking, why not look at the Quiney letter? That was written to
Shakespeare by his fellow Stratfordian Richard Quiney in 1596. It
should be a good guide to how Shakespeare himself spoke, since he and
Quiney were from the same town:

'To my Loveinge good Frend / &amp; contreyman mr wm / Shackespere dlr
thees

Loveinge Contreyman I am bolde of yow as of a frende, craveinge yowr
helpe wth xxxll uppon mr Bushells &amp; my securytee or mr myttons wth me.
mr Rosswell is not come to London as yeate &amp; I have especiall cawse,
yow shall ffrende me muche in helping me out of all the debetts I owe
in London I thanck god &amp; muche quiet my mynde wch wolde nott be
indebeted ...'

In modern spelling and punctuation, it reads:

'To my loving good friend and countryman, Mr William Shakespeare,
deliver these:

Loving countryman,
I am bold of you as of a friend, craving your help with £30 upon Mr
Bushell's and my security, or Mr Mytton's with me. Mr Rosswell is not
come to London as yet, and I have especial cause. You shall friend me
much in helping me out of all the debts I owe in London, I thank God,
and much quiet my mind, which would not be indebted.'

For comparison, here is a letter from Lady Elizabeth Neville, Sir
Francis's eldest half-sister, writing to her brother Nathaniel about
the chance of visiting him in Norfolk (c. 1590):

'To the right worshipfull/and my very good brother/Mr Nathaniell
bacon/geve these

good brother I have receaved your letter wch you sent me by Mr Smyth
who telleth me yt you are very well in healthe wch I hartely thanke
god for/. my cominge into norfolcke I do promise what I can but as
yet yt ys not determyned of I praye you at some covenient leysure wryt
an ernest letter to Sr henry nevell requysting him to com the next
sommer for as I thinke yt will further ye matter motche'

In modern spelling and punctuation:

'To the right worshipful and my very good brother Mr. Nathaniel Bacon
give these:

Good brother,
I have received your letter which you sent me by Mr Smith, who telleth
me that you are very well in health, which I heartily thank God for.
[For ] my coming into Norfolk I do promise what I can, but as yet it
is not determined of. (I pray you at some convenient leisure write an
earnest letter to Sir Henry Neville requesting him to come the next
summer, for as I think that will further the matter much.)'

Although I would suppose Richard Quiney spoke with a different accent
from Lady Neville, I don't see they were using mutually
incomprehensible dialects. It follows that neither was William
Shakespeare.

Many thanks for these transcripts. Am I inattentive in failing to see any
regional differences between them? As to &quot;inflections&quot; in the sense of
spoken accents, I, like you, assume that there would have been regional
differences, but not, as I understand the matter, the class distinction that
gave rise to RP (that is, Sir Francis Neville and Lady Elizabeth Neville
would have used the same accent as their tenant farmers and housemaids).

I don't think it will be possible to show that in 1600 inhabitants of the
whole of the old Anglian and Mercian territory, including London and
Cambridge, spoke in accents similar to one another and distinct from that of
Stratford. But perhaps there is evidence to the contrary: if so, I repeat my
request to Elizabeth Weir to supply details of any differences in the 16th
century dialects of Warwickshire and Norfolk proving or even suggesting
their origins in the Wessex and Anglian varieties of Old English.

Well I can't. I certainly don't see that Richard Quiney was using any

The grammatical construction seems the same too.

This is a tricky one. I think England may have been on the cusp of
developing a class/accent sensitivity. Certainly Nashe, with his
unerring instinct for the politically correct, sneers at northern
accents as 'barbarous' and suggests that the language spoken round
London is the best ('Pierce Penilesse', 1592). This appears to be
attributing cultural superiority to southern speech and if that idea
gained currency, you would expect the upper classes to abandon
regional accents and adopt the socially superior form. But I don't
know how far the process had gone at this point.

That is the Strat version. In reality there's little evidence
that he did much acting and Jonson's listing of him in
EMOHH is probably a joke since his name doesn't appear
on the quarto. Since Sogliardo the rustic actor has the
Stratford actor's coat of arms motto and is certainly
a satire of the Stratford actor it supports the idea

I think not, Grumman. He had a Warwickshire (Saxon) dialect
and he had to lose it and acquire an East Midlands barely-inflected
dialect, somehow acquire a 29,000 word vocabulary in it and write
the best poem in English, the Venus and Adonis in pure university
East Midlands all in the space of a year or two?

That, as some scholar said, would be a miracle that would

He had no education, Grumman. He was an illiterate

"/>

'On the cusp'? Class had long been a fundamental
aspect of that society. With upper class, went
high status, great wealth, distinctive clothing,
special education, knowledge of Law, knowledge
of Latin, travel and knowledge of contemporary
languages,especially French -- and all kinds of
other indicators that would have immediately
identified any member of the upper classes.

Up to about 1360, the upper classes spoke a
different language (French). You are implicitly
asserting that on dropping French, the aristocrats
decided that there was no reason to maintain
any differences from commoners and picked up
the local accent (or patois) wherever they lived.
You are further implicitly asserting that these
aristocrats had so little contact with each other,
or felt that they had so little in common, that
they preferred to identify themselves with their
local people, rather than with the ruling class to
which they belonged. So there was a period of
about 170 years (from ~1370 to ~1540) when
nobles spoke English with local accents.

Such a theory is so half-witted, that it must
surely be academic orthodoxy.

The court was based on London. There was
never the slightest doubt as to which group
possessed 'cultural superiority'. They were a
tightly-knit cohesive group -- the ruling class--
filling all the offices of the state, and all the
professions (insofar as they existed) -- the
high offices in the Church, lawyers and
perhaps doctors; all diplomacy would have
been in their hands.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you would expect the upper classes to abandon

"/>

Surely the question is whether, after English
became the vernacular of the upper classes
(~1360), they ever acquired regional accents?

Let's look at Shakespeare's references to
accents:

Lady Percy (in 2 Henry IV)
&quot; . .
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
Became the accents of the valiant;
For those that could speak low and tardily
Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
In diet, in affections of delight,
In military rules, humours of blood,
He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
That fashion'd others. . . &quot;

From AYLI
ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.
ROSALIND I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak . . .

From Coriolanus
MENENIUS Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than envy you.

Clearly, for Shakespeare, accent denotes the
type and CLASS of person.

From Paul Johnson *Elizabeth*, page 213
The 'Orthographie' by John Hart, an official in the Court
of Wards, which was published in 1569, took a strong
line that the court accent, which he equated with correct
London speech, was the only 'proper' way to talk English.
The most persistent spelling reformer, William Bullokar,
seems to have deliberately changed his native East
Anglian accent into a court/London one; and when the
great headmaster of Merchant Taylors', Richard Mulcaster
(who came from Carlisle), was visited by the school
governors, they had only one complaint: the ushers,
'being Northern men born, had not taught the children to
speak distinctly, or to pronounce their words as well as
they ought'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I don't
&gt; know how far the process had gone at this point.

"/>

You seem to think that the upper classes somehow
'emerged' from the regions. That is, of course, arrant
nonsense. They had been a 'class apart' since the
Conquest. Marriages among them were rarely local.
Up to ~1350 they spoke French and many had
properties in France. After that time, most had
properties in different parts of England. All noble
families had houses in London. All shared the
same tutors. All sent their offspring either to
court or to the houses of other aristocrats in their
early and late youth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't think it will be possible to show that in 1600 inhabitants of the
&gt;&gt; whole of the old Anglian and Mercian territory, including London and
&gt;&gt; Cambridge, spoke in accents similar to one another and distinct from that of
&gt;&gt; Stratford.

"/>

Even if we assume that Oxford was allowed
to mix with the local village boys when growing
up (very unlikely IMO) his parents had a
substantial house in London, and would have
attended all the major state ceremonies. Young
children would also have attended these -- as
they do now -- performing minor duties
appropriate to their age . . . bearing bouquets
of flowers, acting as pages, etc. In November
1558, when he was eight years old, the 'new
administration' came into power and the Oxfords
were at its heart. His mother became a Maid of
Honour to the Queen; his tutors (such as Sir
Thomas Smith) immediately obtained high office.
The boy probably spent most of his time in
London from then on, mixing with others of his
class and, of course, speaking in the court
accent.

Alan Nelson's notion that Oxford spoke with
an Essex accent shows only what a thoroughly
bad historian he is.

It's the identification of a person's class primarily by accent rather
than dress and manners that I think was evolving then, Paul.
Consequently I've snipped your next redundant paragraph in which you
point out that class was already a big feature of English society.

I'm sure Shakespeare, like other educated men of his day, knew
perfectly well the English he spoke differed from that of the
ploughboy in the fields. There are umpteen scenes in contemporary
drama which make fun of 'clownish' speech. That is not the same as
saying that all educated men in Elizabethan England spoke in the same
way and without any trace of regional accent. We certainly know
Ralegh 'spake broad Devonshire to his dying day'. Was he the only

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From Paul Johnson *Elizabeth*, page 213
&gt; The 'Orthographie' by John Hart, an official in the Court
&gt; of Wards, which was published in 1569, took a strong
&gt; line that the court accent, which he equated with correct
&gt; London speech, was the only 'proper' way to talk English.
&gt; The most persistent spelling reformer, William Bullokar,
&gt; seems to have deliberately changed his native East
&gt; Anglian accent into a court/London one; and when the
&gt; great headmaster of Merchant Taylors', Richard Mulcaster
&gt; (who came from Carlisle), was visited by the school
&gt; governors, they had only one complaint: the ushers,
&gt; 'being Northern men born, had not taught the children to
&gt; speak distinctly, or to pronounce their words as well as
&gt; they ought'.

"/>

Yes, this is relevant. But from the evidence cited it sounds as if
the process is only beginning, which, if you remember Paul, was the
point I made earlier. Had the social superiority of the court accent
been universally recognised Mulcaster would have taken care to see it
was transmitted to his pupils. For comparison - can you imagine a
19th century Eton headmaster allowing his boys to pick up a northern
accent from their tutors?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But I don't
&gt;&gt; know how far the process had gone at this point.

&gt; You seem to think that the upper classes somehow
&gt; 'emerged' from the regions. That is, of course, arrant
&gt; nonsense. They had been a 'class apart' since the
&gt; Conquest. Marriages among them were rarely local.

"/>

You wouldn't care to substantiate that last statement, would you? It
depends where you draw the line under 'upper class'. The royal dukes?
The earls? If you look into genealogy of the ancient county families
you see that their marriages were very much local.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even if we assume that Oxford was allowed

&gt; children would also have attended these -- as
&gt; they do now -- performing minor duties
&gt; appropriate to their age . . . bearing bouquets

&gt; 1558, when he was eight years old, the 'new

&gt; Thomas Smith) immediately obtained high office.

&gt; London from then on, mixing with others of his
&gt; class and, of course, speaking in the court

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a tricky one. I think England may have been on the cusp of

&gt;&gt; 'On the cusp'? Class had long been a fundamental

&gt; It's the identification of a person's class primarily by accent rather

Is there a strongly class-structured society
anywhere in the world where the ruling
class speaks with the same accent as the
lower classes? Has there ever been one?

You are implicitly asserting that there are,
and, indeed, that the accents of the small
educated literate group should normally
be expected to be the same as that of the
masses. That is so at odds with human
experience, that only an academic could
believe in it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Consequently I've snipped your next redundant paragraph in which you
&gt; point out that class was already a big feature of English society.
&gt; You have a habit of working up a snorting head of steam refuting

Your theory (that there was no difference in
accent) is only possible when you set out to
ignore the enormous differences between the
aristocracy and the masses in the 15th century.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; Up to about 1360, the upper classes spoke a
&gt;&gt; different language (French). You are implicitly
&gt;&gt; asserting that on dropping French, the aristocrats
&gt;&gt; decided that there was no reason to maintain
&gt;&gt; any differences from commoners and picked up
&gt;&gt; the local accent (or patois) wherever they lived.

&gt; Well what do you think happened, Paul? They all got together one day
&gt; and decided - in French of course - to give up French?
&gt;&quot;Alors, mes amis, c'est 1360. Il faut parler en anglais maintenant.&quot;
&gt; (Pause)
&gt;&quot;Oh, right you are, old chap. As long as we don't have to start
&gt; talkin' like a bunch of oiks.&quot;
&gt; And thus a great socio-linguistic revolution occurred.

"/>

There would have been thousands (and
possibly millions) of conversations of this
sort when it was happening. There was no
real danger of &quot;talkin' like a bunch of oiks&quot;
because, being literate, educated, wealthy,
with all manner of possessions, knowing
French and Latin, and having travelled,
they spoke of quite different matters (such
the ordinary daily activities of gentlemen)
with longer words and with more elaborate
concepts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You are further implicitly asserting that these
&gt;&gt; aristocrats had so little contact with each other,
&gt;&gt; or felt that they had so little in common, that
&gt;&gt; they preferred to identify themselves with their
&gt;&gt; local people, rather than with the ruling class to
&gt;&gt; which they belonged. So there was a period of
&gt;&gt; about 170 years (from ~1370 to ~1540) when
&gt;&gt; nobles spoke English with local accents.

&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Such a theory is so half-witted, that it must
&gt;&gt; surely be academic orthodoxy.

&gt; Of course. I admire the way you pre-empt any existing arguments along

interest in phonetics and dialectology:

&quot;...we possess a considerable body of evidence of a kind which is
wanting for those of earlier times. In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries there were many writers who endeavoured, with no little
ability, to give a minute account of the English pronunciation of
their own day, parlty by description of the organic formation or the
acoustic effect of the sounds, and partly by the comparison with the
sounds of foreign languages.&quot;

He then goes on to mention in passing sources as diverse as Gill's
'Logonomia Anglica' and Rid's 'Martin Mark-all'. I hadn't heard of
either and I certainly haven't read them (couldn't read Gill, at least
not in the original Latin). Bradley was joint editor of the Oxford
English Dictionary. With what hope of being taken seriously can you
dismiss his judgements as &quot;the usual assumption made by bad
historians&quot;? I could write that Einstein's theory of relativity was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it did happen, Elizabeth. (1) We know from the direct
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that the butcher acted on the London stage.

"/>

Unfortunately I've come in on this thread very late. The &quot;butcher&quot; did
indeed act on the London stage. As to what parts he played, we're
still somewhat in the dark, although the Roscius annotation dug up by
Altrocchi seems to suggest that he may have been a major player. I'd
like to suggest here, though, that doesn't make him the author of the
canon.

The question of dialect is an interesting one. Although scholars have
attempted to reconstruct, there are probably no absolute answers to
how people who came from different areas spoke in the sixteenth
century, or whether nobles spoke differently from commoners.

However, I'd like to make a couple of observations:

1. Noblemen in the sixteenth century were generally brought up by
local nannies who would be speaking the regional dialect. They would
then be tutored rather than going to school. I imagine their accents,
if still malleable, would rather depend on the accent of their tutor.

2. My husband taught at an English public school, Repton, in the
seventies. A public school in England is a private school where the
well-to-do send their children. It was our experience that children
coming into the prep (lower) boarding school at the age of seven often
spoke with regional accents, but their accents changed to what was
considered &quot;accentless&quot; English as they progressed at school. Since
noblemen in the sixteenth century generally did not attend school,
it's hard to know whether their accent would be that of their poorer
neighbours or something rather rarer that immediately identified them
as belonging to the upper classes. Perhaps an &quot;upper class&quot; accent
emerged later, as it became the habit to send the children of wealthy
parents to public schools, but that is only my conjecture.

3. Even up until and in the seventies, when I was living in England,
it was occasionally hard for me (a Londoner) to understand
accents/dialects of people from other places. I found the Newcastle
accent, for example, particularly hard to decipher. It is interesting
to note that this was at a time when dialect was attenuating, perhaps
because of the influence of TV and radio. I imagine someone from
Stratford in the sixteenth century spoke in a reasonably broad
dialect, as did those from other parts of England. However, people in
the southern states of the US still speak with a very different accent
from those who live in New York or Toronto. You will notice that
actors tend to smooth out their accents when acting on tv or film. I
see no reason why Shakespeare of Stratford could not have done
something similar.

4. Several people have suggested that the Earl of Oxford spoke and
wrote (his letters) in an English which showed evidence of dialect and
therefore he couldn't have written the canon. I think this is a
non-starter also, as though he may well have spoken a particular
dialect, his early published poems show no evidence of it. So either
he or a compositor &quot;regularised&quot; his English. The same may well be
true of the Shakespeare plays and poems so he cannot be disqualified
as the author on this basis. Neither, I suppose, can Shakespeare of
Stratford.

5. Roger Stritmatter in Carmel showed that there is indeed evidence of
Warwickshire dialect in Taming of the Shrew, but the person who speaks
in that dialect, Sly, is portrayed in rather a negative manner (I
think I got that right. Please correct me if wrong. Was suffering
rather badly from jet lag and less than three hours of sleep).

So how are we further along?

He may or may not have been illiterate. It is helpful to us

to that effect, except six rather poorly executed signatures, which
tend to lead us to believe that he may have been functionally
illiterate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;One result of investigation that appears to be well established is

Let's start from the basics. You accept, I trust,
that when Nashe was writing, the great majority

Now, according to you, Nashe was telling us
that THEY read poetry and thereby learned to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neverthess we are supposed to believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the Stratford Butcher rolled into town from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warwickshire with his heavily-inflected Germanic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect--Londoners couldn't even understand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Warwickshire dialect--and whipped out the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Venus and Adonis in pure East Midlands university
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It didn't happen, Reedy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it did happen, Elizabeth. (1) We know from the direct
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that the butcher acted on the London stage.

&gt;&gt; That is the Strat version.

&gt; ONE anecdote is enough for you to call him a butcher, but dismiss five

Yes. All the actors' names appeared on the quarto
except 'Shakespeare' as it was spelled after 1598.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Since Sogliardo the rustic actor has the

&gt;&gt;&gt; that Londoners could understand him.

&gt;&gt; He played small parts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) Whatever dialect he may have
&gt;&gt;&gt; had as a child, he could have overcome as many others have.

&gt;&gt; I think not, Grumman. He had a Warwickshire (Saxon) dialect
&gt;&gt; and he had to lose it and acquire an East Midlands barely-inflected
&gt;&gt; dialect, somehow acquire a 29,000 word vocabulary in it

&gt; Wow, this is new to me: you're saying his &quot;dialect&quot; didn't have words
&gt; in common with &quot;English.&quot;

"/>

His 'dialect' had words in common with English because
Anglo-Saxon is the basic German-Danish dialect (the
Angles or 'Englisc' as they called themselves and their
dialect, were more Danish than German) but English got
a 'double dose of Danish' with the Danelaw.

The effect of the Danelaw--an artificial situation caused
by a treaty which pushed the Danes mainly into East Anglia
but also into Yorkshire--was to eventually STRIP the Anglo-Saxon
dialect of its German inflections and ADD more Danish to
the OE vocabulary transforming it to ME. Since there was
no BBC to standardize the 'presige' East Midlands dialect
the shires, which even today stubbornly hang on to their dialects
to some extent, didn't have to give up their dialects. OE was still
spoken in some shires until the 1800s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But how do you explain the fact that I can
&gt; as easily read the documents from the Stratford of his time, like
&gt; Shakespeare's will, and the minutes of town meetings (or whatever they
&gt; were) as I can read documents from London of his time.

"/>

Sturley, for example, was an educated lawyer according to Fripp.
He wrote in fairly good Latin and English. He sent two sons to
the universities also according to Fripp. Sturley may have gone
to Cambridge himself. There's some reference to Sturley's
university education in Fripp. Quyney, on the other hand, was
educated at the local grammar school which is more than we
can say for your authorship candidate.

The second reason, probably, is that after 1500 clerks began
to write in 'Chancery' which was pure East Midlands. Just as
we have a uniform legalese, they had uniform legalese. If you're
writing a brief for court the 'dialect,' so to speak, it's in exactly
the same 'dialect' as in administrative reports.

The Stratford minutes would be written in the dialect of
administrative or court reports or parliamentary minutes.
East Midlands.

I learned from Fripp that you cannot judge the Stratford Corporation
by the primitive mind of the Stratford Pest because the Stratford
Corporation was a *republican* institution run on *parliamentary
procedure.*

Unlike the Stratford SOB who sided with the murderously
greedy Combes AGAINST the Stratford corporation so Combes
could starve out 506 Stratfordians whose livelihood depended on
their shares in the commons--which was not pasture but garden,
grain, hay, orchard plots--agriculture and horticulture--the Stratford
Corporation was an *evolved political institution* functioning very
efficiently at the local level. I doubt local government today functions
as well.

The Shakespeare plays are about the evolution of political
institutions but the record of the conduct of the Stratford Menace
in his home shire proves that there is no way in hell, Grumman,
that sucn an Immoral Beast could have written the Shakespeare works
which, as Yamada stated, form republics where they are translated.

You're enrolled in a Big Lie, Grumman, and it was concocted

Grumman. The Standard Dialect can be read and written by
people who, for example, speak an Elizabethan West Virginian
dialect at home. It doesn't mean that they don't cherish their
local dialects.

Starting with the ME period in England, a
standardized English--East Midlands--began to predominate
IN TEXTS. Not in dialects. Literacy was confined to the
1) the monasteries 2) courts 3) Court.

And as Dr. Carper has pointed out, it's about syntax
although the local dialects also have different +/-
Danish content vocabularies. There were zero Danish words
in the extreme south of England but many in Yorkshire,
for example.

It's not even difficult to see the difference between Jonson's
dialect and the pure East Midlands of the author of the
Shakespeare works. Jonson was born in Warwickshire and
raised in the lower class environs of London although his parents
probably spoke East Midlands because his father was a cleric,
i.e., university educated.

Only Nashe, of the Elizabethans I've read, has a pure East Midlands
dialect like 'Shakespeare,' that is, Francis Bacon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; (3) His
&gt;&gt;&gt; place of birth need not dictate his dialect since not everyone in any

&gt;&gt;&gt; university-educated schoolmasters from elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; He had no education, Grumman. He was an illiterate
&gt;&gt; and the best explanation is that John Shakespeare kept
&gt;&gt; him out of the Anglican school because the Shakespeares
&gt;&gt; were Catholic.

&gt; Against this nonsense we have his signatures and the direct testimony
&gt; of his monument.

"/>

His 'signatures,' so-called, are barbaric and we don't
know which ones Thomas Greene, his 'cousin' but more
likely a retainter sent down to keep the Burgher's drunken
mouth under control, wrote. Greene, Marston's bedfellow--
the Elizabethans piled unselfconsciously in to bed together--
at Gray's Inn is obviously the one who blabbed to Marson about
Francis Bacon's authorship of Spenser, Marlowe and Shakespeare
as Marston and Hall couldn't say enough about in their Satyres
in 1598 which got recalled and burned by Whitgift although
luckily three copies!--one of each! survived and survived
Stratfordians which is even more astonishing!!!

And as I have said exhaustively, Grumman, the monument

IS NOT 'DIRECT' TESTIMONY.

It is NO TESTIMONY at all because nobody knows who put it
there. We've been through the NATURE OF FACT before:

Evidence + credible witness = fact.

All we know is that it's not the original because the
screw holes don't match and it's probably the trickster
Jonson's because it's written in his inimitable style.

My guess is that Jonson took it down to Stratford--we
know he and his entourage of university wits made a
visit to Stratford just after the death of the Immortal Fraud
so my guess is its probably a joke on Bacon whom Jonson despised
until 1619 at which time Jonson made a drastic reversal and came
to revere Bacon. I still don't know what that was all about unless
his patron Pembroke sent Jonson to Gorhambury to edit his,
Pembroke's, cousin's First Folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think not, Grumman. He had a Warwickshire (Saxon) dialect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and he had to lose it and acquire an East Midlands barely-inflected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect, somehow acquire a 29,000 word vocabulary in it

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, this is new to me: you're saying his &quot;dialect&quot; didn't have words
&gt;&gt;&gt; in common with &quot;English.&quot;

&gt;&gt; His 'dialect' had words in common with English because
&gt;&gt; Anglo-Saxon is the basic German-Danish dialect (the
&gt;&gt; Angles or 'Englisc' as they called themselves and their
&gt;&gt; dialect, were more Danish than German) but English got
&gt;&gt; a 'double dose of Danish' with the Danelaw.

&gt;&gt; The effect of the Danelaw--an artificial situation caused
&gt;&gt; by a treaty which pushed the Danes mainly into East Anglia
&gt;&gt; but also into Yorkshire--was to eventually STRIP the Anglo-Saxon
&gt;&gt; dialect of its German inflections and ADD more Danish to
&gt;&gt; the OE vocabulary transforming it to ME. Since there was
&gt;&gt; no BBC to standardize the 'presige' East Midlands dialect
&gt;&gt; the shires, which even today stubbornly hang on to their dialects
&gt;&gt; to some extent, didn't have to give up their dialects. OE was still
&gt;&gt; spoken in some shires until the 1800s.

The signatures are not at all poorly executed, and one is a

would indicate literacy for anyone but Shakespeare. Aside from that,
we have the testimony of the monument, which says he wrote. We also
have direct evidence that he was an actor, which strongly suggests he
could read, if not write. And the circumstantial evidence
overwhelmingly suggests he attended the grammar school near his
well-to-do, ambitious father's house.

Hey, why didn't the herald who wrote contemptuously on a drawing of

I accept a large percentage were: I have no idea if they were 'the

&gt; 5. Roger Stritmatter in Carmel showed that there is indeed
&gt; evidence of Warwickshire dialect in Taming of the Shrew, but
&gt; the person who speaks in that dialect, Sly, is portrayed in
&gt; rather a negative manner (I think I got that right. Please
&gt; correct me if wrong. Was suffering rather badly from jet lag
&gt; and less than three hours of sleep).

"/>

I don't know what R.S. said, of course, but this certainly
rings several bells for me. It was in fact something I (rather
opaquely) referred to in a recent post. Art Neuendorffer had
said:

&quot;Leonard Sly = Christopher Sly = Christopher Marlowe =. . .&quot;

to which I replied:

&quot;Really? To my way of thinking it would be:
Christopher Sly = William Sly = William Shakespeare
and [slightly modified as I later wished I had put it]
Katerina (Kate) Minola = Christopher (Kit) Marlowe&quot;

What I had in mind when I said this was that there are quite
a few reasons for linking Christopher Sly with William Shake-
speare of Stratford, including references to nearby villages,
and Warwickshire terms such as &quot;thirdborough&quot;. Sly, however,
does not appear in any of the sources (other than *The Taming
of A Shrew*, which may or may not have been one).

So the first time we heard of Christopher Sly was in 1594,
with the publication of *A Shrew*, based a play which was
certainly in performance before Marlowe's death but which
may not have originally included the Sly scenes.

Here we have someone who is linked more closely with William
Shakespeare himself than any other character of his - with
the possible exception of William in *As You Like It* - and
we see this person, formerly associated with the wool trade,
and &quot;by transmutation&quot; a bearherd (at the bearpit next to
Henslowe's 'Rose'?) waking up one morning to find himself
living a totally new life, and with what also seems to be
a totally new identity.

And one of the first things he does is to watch a play in
which someone who was apparently loudmouthed, quarrelsome
and disobedient is 'tamed', to the extent that she will not
only do what she is told in future, but will even appear to
believe what she is told to believe. Much as, you may recall,
I think may well have happened to Christopher Marlowe.

"/>

To ask such a question reveals an ignorance on the subject as profound as
Elizabeth's. Old English as a spoken language was dead before 1000, though
scribal conservatism preserved many of its inflexional forms for a few
decades beyond that date (the evidence for this is the apparent rapidity of
its collapse after the Norman Conquest: what changed so rapidly was not the
spoken language but the will to represent it in terms of a vanished
standard).

Now there is nothing wrong with ignorance: every one of us is profoundly
ignorant about most things: it's inevitable. But sane people are generally
capable of recognising where their ignorance lies; what distinguishes
anti-Strat nutters like Crowley, Weir and Kennedy is their grotesque and
unteachable confidence in expressing opinions about matters on which they
must know they are ignorant.

"/>

Nashe was not engaged in presenting a flat
sociological report on the conditions of his
nation (such as would meet the standards of,
say, a 21st century Government investigation).
He was arguing a case, and pushing it to, and
beyond, all reasonable limits -- largely out of
a sense of fun. He was rarely 100% serious.
(Heck, he was rarely 20% serious!) I'm sure
he knew how bad his argument was. But if he
rushed on at a furious pace, no one would
notice -- after all, you didn't.

Secondly, he was addressing courtiers, and by
'the vulgar sort' he meant the next layer down --
the literate, aspiring middle-classes who were,
in fact, often trying to 'improve their speech'.
Some of them were buying books and, maybe
sometimes, even reading poetry.

But the argument that poetry had 'made the
vulgar sort aspire to richer purity of speech'
is close to nonsense -- and IMO contained
about as much truth as it did in, say, the 1920s.
The pressures to 'talk proper' came from other
directions. Only a relatively small number
could manage to 'speak like the Queen',
without getting pulled back down by their
family and friends.

Maybe he thought he could get away with
such an argument because the courtiers
knew little of the lives of the middle-classes.
But, as I said before, it was mainly an
exercise in rhetoric -- where the pace and
fluency of the prose deceives the eye.

Well, it *may* suggest literacy if they were all written by the same

not. Besides, many people who were functionally illiterate learned to
write their own names so they could sign a document, etc. So being

Some actors can't read, or at least can't read well. Susan Hampshire,
a famous actress in Britain, has a good memory for lines but is
dyslexic. But even so, as you've said, he may have been able to read,

have been difficult to fashion the plays without that ability.

And the circumstantial evidence

There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
attend grammar school. We simply don't know. That is one of the
reasons there is doubt among the different anti-Stratfordian groups
that he wrote the plays. His father was well to do but fell into
disgrace. And how do we know how ambitious he was? He seemed more
ambitious, according to the new Wood book and film, with regard to
making money. He did so, in the main part, by conducting illegal
transactions in fleece (Wood shows us the court records in his film).
This seems to suggest that teaching his son to read was not as high on
his list of priorities as teaching him to make money by nefarious
means. But this is just conjecture, as are most statements with regard
to Shakespeare and his family.

&gt; I'm doing my best.

&gt;&gt; There is no record that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt; Stratford attended school.

&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt; However, that doesn't mean that he didn't.

&gt; How do you prove 'it doesn't mean that he didn't?'
&gt; You can reduce it to 'it means that he did' but then
&gt; you have to prove that 'he did.'

"/>

One can say &quot;it doesn't mean that he didn't,&quot; of course. There is no
proof required. You can't cancel out the double negative and suggest
I'm saying &quot;This means that he did.&quot; I'm clearly not. There is no
point in making our case at the expense of someone else's. The fact
that there is any kind of doubt that he did have a decent education is
what got all us anti-Strats started in the first place. That's all one
needs--doubt. We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not
have a grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by
way of a list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

Whether a grammar school education--which he may or may not have
had--would fit him to be the writer of the canon is another matter
entirely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Otherwise we can assume that until Strats bring the
&gt; required proof forward we don't have to treat their
&gt; candidate as the author of the Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt; He may or may not have been illiterate.

&gt; Now that, in terms of logic, is true, and if we
&gt; lived in common sense reality instead of the
&gt; nonsensical world of the Aristotelian syllogism,
&gt; we would do the right thing and put 'By Anonymous'
&gt; on the title pages of that body of works once
&gt; attributed to a Stratford illiterate. ;)

See, you've just admitted that he may or may not have been illiterate,
and then you call him &quot;a Stratford illiterate.&quot; How does one statement
follow the other?

Are you saying that you think many of those who do
not become literate, learn to write their own name
before grade one? I'm no expert, but I strongly
suspect that the ability to sign one's name by
the age of 6 is very very strongly correlated with
the ability to learn to read.

John, I'm sure, was referring to whether or not there were
many *Elizabethans* who could sign their names but not read
or write anything else. (We all know of a few examples from
more recent times, but we don't know of any Elizabethans in
that category.) Were there some? Probably. Were they
common? I see no reason to think so.

In any event, Elizabethan educational theorists(like Edmund
Coote or Richard Mulcaster) seem to have believed that
students should be taught writing skills *after* they had
mastered the basics reading. Any who could write their
names but couldn't read, would most likely have acquired
that minimal skill outside of school and in an era when
there seems to have been little stigma attached to making
a mark on a legal document, I doubt many non-reading adults
would have seen much value in learning only to sign their
names.

&gt; What I had in mind when I said this was that there are quite
&gt; a few reasons for linking Christopher Sly with William Shake-
&gt; speare of Stratford, including references to nearby villages,
&gt; and Warwickshire terms such as &quot;thirdborough&quot;. Sly, however,
&gt; does not appear in any of the sources (other than *The Taming
&gt; of A Shrew*, which may or may not have been one).

&gt; So the first time we heard of Christopher Sly was in 1594,
&gt; with the publication of *A Shrew*, based a play which was
&gt; certainly in performance before Marlowe's death but which
&gt; may not have originally included the Sly scenes.

&gt; Here we have someone who is linked more closely with William
&gt; Shakespeare himself than any other character of his - with
&gt; the possible exception of William in *As You Like It* - and
&gt; we see this person, formerly associated with the wool trade,
&gt; and &quot;by transmutation&quot; a bearherd (at the bearpit next to
&gt; Henslowe's 'Rose'?) waking up one morning to find himself
&gt; living a totally new life, and with what also seems to be
&gt; a totally new identity.

&gt; And one of the first things he does is to watch a play in
&gt; which someone who was apparently loudmouthed, quarrelsome
&gt; and disobedient is 'tamed', to the extent that she will not
&gt; only do what she is told in future, but will even appear to
&gt; believe what she is told to believe. Much as, you may recall,

Actually, the only signature that is sophisticated is in a
particularly cramped space and had to be shortened. All the
signatures have points in common, such as the dot of the i under the

sophisticated signature because the i is missing; uncertain in the
other two cases), the pointedness of the m's, the levelness of ths

accompanies one of the signatures, and is almost certainly in the same
hand, the m of &quot;me&quot; being very much like the &quot;m&quot; in &quot;William.&quot; They

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Besides, many people who were functionally illiterate learned to

I doubt that &quot;many&quot; functional illiterates learned only to write their
own signatures. It makes little sense to me that someone who could
learn to write his name would, if of normal or superior intelligence
would not go on to learn other words. But you're right in saying that
some who could sign their names were not literate. that does not make
Shakespeare's signature non-evidence, it only makes them non-proofs.

Right. But it is Direct Evidence. You cannot reasonably deny that,
only that it was mistaken or a lie. But you need direct evidence to

monument's erroneousness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We also
&gt;&gt; have direct evidence that he was an actor, which strongly suggests he
&gt;&gt; could read, if not write.

&gt; Some actors can't read, or at least can't read well. Susan Hampshire,
&gt; a famous actress in Britain, has a good memory for lines but is
&gt; dyslexic. But even so, as you've said, he may have been able to read,
&gt; but we still have no direct evidence that he could write. It would
&gt; have been difficult to fashion the plays without that ability.

"/>

Right, but his being an actor is evidence that he could read.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And the circumstantial evidence
&gt;&gt; overwhelmingly suggests he attended the grammar school near his
&gt;&gt; well-to-do, ambitious father's house.

"/>

That he had a brother who could write his name and another who was an
actor is circumstantial evidence that John's sons got education enough
to be able to write, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
&gt; attend grammar school. We simply don't know. That is one of the
&gt; reasons there is doubt among the different anti-Stratfordian groups
&gt; that he wrote the plays. His father was well to do but fell into
&gt; disgrace. And how do we know how ambitious he was? He seemed more
&gt; ambitious, according to the new Wood book and film, with regard to
&gt; making money. He did so, in the main part, by conducting illegal
&gt; transactions in fleece (Wood shows us the court records in his film).
&gt; This seems to suggest that teaching his son to read was not as high on
&gt; his list of priorities as teaching him to make money by nefarious
&gt; means. But this is just conjecture, as are most statements with regard
&gt; to Shakespeare and his family.

"/>

But he applied for a coat of arms, which indicates a desire for
status, and having sons who had schooling would then have been
considered a mark of status.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Hey, why didn't the herald who wrote contemptuously on a drawing of
&gt;&gt; his coat of arms that he was an actor make the stronger point that he
&gt;&gt; was an ILLITERATE actor?
&gt; Dunno. Perhaps Shakespeare wasn't obliged to write when in the
&gt; presence of the herald so the guy had no idea whether he could read or
&gt; write. Maybe the herald didn't guess that we would all be arguing over
&gt; his words four hundred years later and so was not scrupulous enough to
&gt; record every fact about the man. Have not seen this piece of
&gt; information before. Thank you.

"/>

But the herald wanted to show how wrong the other hearld was for
awarding the Shakespeare family a coat of arms; ergo, why didn't he
investigate Shakespeare sufficiently to find out he was illiterate
(and, according to Elizabeth and Richard Kennedy, a whoremaster)?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is one of the reasons there is doubt among the different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anti-Stratfordian groups

&gt;&gt;&gt;All of which are made up entirely of dupes and paranoid
&gt;&gt;&gt;schizophrenics, most of the latter also lying scum.

&gt;&gt; Your compassion for people whom you have diagnosed as suffering from
&gt;&gt; a serious illness is breathtaking. It seems to me that if anything
&gt;&gt; could mitigate a person's inability to speak the truth, schizophrenia
&gt;&gt; could, but I gather that you consider it a moral failing? Or do you
&gt;&gt; simply feel that schizophrenia is no excuse for misperceiving
&gt;&gt; reality?

&gt; Shakespeare deniers aren't satisfied with their delusional
&gt; interpretations of reality, they also end up lying outright about the
&gt; evidence, e.g., the Puttenham forgery and Susannah's literacy.

"/>

To me, that looks just as much like a tissue of fantasy and fallacy as
anything ever written by a &quot;Shakespeare denier.&quot; The undemonstrated,
and highly dubious, assumption that all people who deny or doubt
Shakespeare's authorship of his own works are so similar that they can
all be accused of things done by any one member is paired with still-
undemonstrated assertions of mental illness and deliberate lying, neatly
invalidating the entire argument.

If you were to analyze your own statements (taking into account your use
of terms you evidently don't understand, e.g., paranoid schizophrenics),
you'd have to conclude that you were lying. For my own part, I don't
know whether you're lying or not; I have learned to live with the fact
that the only person you can ever know is lying is yourself. To accuse
others of lying when you cannot know whether or not the charge is true
runs a little too close to the edge of bearing false witness; I prefer
to give you the benefit of the doubt and think you're just wrong.

The points that Jonson made are debatable and open to interpretation.
You might like to inform me as to the points that Hemminges and

If you believe that someone is sick, twisted, evil and a liar because
s/he holds a different point of view from your own on the Shakespeare
Authorship question, I feel very sorry for you. You are missing out on
so much, because there are so few of us genuinely interested in
Shakespeare and the Elizabethan era and we are much more alike than we
are different. Two weeks ago, by the way, I was invited to dinner
while in Baltimore and found out Terry Ross makes excellent Chinese
food, possibly the best I've ever tasted. (How's that for a non
sequitur?)He also knows a fair bit about Shakespeare, and he and his
wife and I and my friend (it might really surprise you to know who
that is) had a great time talking about the bard's plays and trying to
sort out which was our favourite.

I'm as grateful for my friendship with Terry as I am for my friendship
with any Oxfordian. He has taught me a lot about poetry, something
about music--and even a tiny bit about birds! Having had the
opportunity to get to know him is a great joy to me. Getting to know
other Strats and anti-Strats on this forum and others has been great
fun too. Life is very short. One never knows how much time one has. I
don't feel I can afford to feel the kind of bile that spills out of
you. To my mind, you're missing out on a lot, and ranting is never a
happy business anyway. But please do go on calling me names and
telling me I'm a liar if it makes you feel better about things. It
doesn't make me feel in the least bit bad. I knew when I decided to
come on hlas that there would be people such as yourself who prefer to
intimidate rather than argue in any kind of constructive way, and I
understood I had to be ready for it if I were to join in the

Yes, you're likely right. There must be a strong correlation. And I

&gt; Far be it from me to willingly argue for the other side, Elizabeth,
&gt; but the fact that there isn't a shred of evidence does not mean he

"/>

I don't perceive that you're 'arguing for the other side,'
Lynne. We're discussing process. You were right when
you said above 'we need to stick with what we know or
do not know.'

Since we do know for certain that there is no
evidence that the Stratfordian candidate could read
we cannot allow the Strats to claim that he was literate.

If the Strats want to claim that their candidate is
literate, let the Strats produce the evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It means that he *may not* have had one.

"/>

The authorship dispute is analogous to a court
proceeding. There are no 'shades of authorship.'
Either William Shakespear wrote the works or he
did not. At some point there will be a 'ruling' and
we will have to conclude that the Strats have either
met or not met the burden of proof.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You're right that we cannot conclude absolutely that he did, and I
&gt; believe I've said that several times over.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be immensely helpful.

&gt;&gt; I'm doing my best.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no record that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford attended school.

&gt;&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, that doesn't mean that he didn't.

&gt;&gt; How do you prove 'it doesn't mean that he didn't?'
&gt;&gt; You can reduce it to 'it means that he did' but then
&gt;&gt; you have to prove that 'he did.'

&gt; One can say &quot;it doesn't mean that he didn't,&quot; of course. There is no
&gt; proof required. You can't cancel out the double negative and suggest
&gt; I'm saying &quot;This means that he did.&quot; I'm clearly not. There is no
&gt; point in making our case at the expense of someone else's.

"/>

Any case that is 'made' is made at the expense of 'someone
else's case.' This situation has no ecumenical potential
because there will be one Shakespeare and four or five
losers.

Despite that reality, I have a different take on the authorship
dispute because I stay focused on the evidence. I'm prepared
at any time to abandon Bacon's authorship if Strats, Oxfordians
or Marlovians can trump the Baconian's evidence. So far I have
seen nothing from Marlovians or Oxfordians and nothing new
from Strats.

I would be sorry to give up Bacon's authorship. After
I got used to the idea that Bacon was Shakespeare and
started studying Bacon, I came to agree with his biographyer,
the repected classical scholar James Spedding who wrote,
'Bacon is thrilling.'

Spedding was a conservative scholar, very
temperate in his statements, but in his one and only
outburst Spedding was right.

Bacon is thrilling.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact
&gt; that there is any kind of doubt that he did have a decent education is
&gt; what got all us anti-Strats started in the first place. That's all one
&gt; needs--doubt.

"/>

Doubt is the starting point. (That's got to be some
kind of cliche).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not
&gt; have a grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by
&gt; way of a list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

"/>

There are two parts to the argument against the
Strat claim that their candidate was literate.

Part I: Strats have no evidence of literacy.
They make the limp argument that 'Shakespeare
wrote the Shakespeare plays--see, his name's
on the title page--so Shakespeare was literate .
That's called a circular argument.

Part II: The anti-Strats have a very good circumstantial
case against his literacy based on his sibs and childrens'
illiteracy, the fact that Catholics were reluctant to send
their sons to 'heretical' Anglican schools, the fact that
commoners' had only one book in the house, the bible,
and for Catholics the bible was on the Papal Index,
the fact that in six barbaric signatures he can't
spell his own name the same way twice, etc.

So we have zero evidence from the Strats to support
their claim VERSUS a good circumstantial case against
the Strat claim. Therefore, until Strats come up with
the evidence we are entitled to state that the Stratford
tradesman was illiterate. It goes without saying that
this is not an absolute statement since in a cause and
effect universe there are always surprises.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whether a grammar school education--which he may or may not have
&gt; had--would fit him to be the writer of the canon is another matter
&gt; entirely.

"/>

His education has to match the works and the
works are without doubt history's most erudite literary
works, so erudite they have inspired over a
hundred thousand PhD theses, over 300,000 books,
hundreds of thousands of articles and this is
doesn't count all the foreign scholarship on the
Shakespeare works. Strats duck the question
about how this supreme genius obtained a
vocabulary of 29,000 words in a dialect not
his own. There's no evidence at all that Stratford
considered him to be a prodigy. The only remark
in the record is that he was 'sharp at trade.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Otherwise we can assume that until Strats bring the
&gt;&gt; required proof forward we don't have to treat their
&gt;&gt; candidate as the author of the Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He may or may not have been illiterate.

&gt;&gt; Now that, in terms of logic, is true, and if we
&gt;&gt; lived in common sense reality instead of the
&gt;&gt; nonsensical world of the Aristotelian syllogism,
&gt;&gt; we would do the right thing and put 'By Anonymous'
&gt;&gt; on the title pages of that body of works once
&gt;&gt; attributed to a Stratford illiterate. ;)

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth

&gt; See, you've just admitted that he may or may not have been illiterate,
&gt; and then you call him &quot;a Stratford illiterate.&quot; How does one statement
&gt; follow the other?

"/>

Because the statement 'he may or may not have
been illiterate.' while technically true, is meaningless
in the context of the authorship dispute. Furthermore,
any candidate for Shakespeare authorship must be
*supremely literate.*

There can be no 300 years of dilly dallying about on
the question of whether or not the Stratford tradesman
could read or write his name.

The Shakespeare works demand a standard of genius
like no other body of works.

I'm sure that many of the children(especially the girls)

some difficulty. Additionally, there were many children

Not sure. I'm not expert enough to know although I believe secretary

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Besides, many people who were functionally illiterate learned to
&gt;&gt; write their own names so they could sign a document, etc. So being
&gt;&gt; skilled enough to sign one's own name would not necessarily indicate
&gt;&gt; literacy for *anyone but Shakespeare* or for Shakespeare himself. I
&gt;&gt; can assure you that I don't hold him to a different standard.

&gt; I doubt that &quot;many&quot; functional illiterates learned only to write their
&gt; own signatures. It makes little sense to me that someone who could

Maybe. We're all conjecturing about this.

Correct.

&gt; Right. But it is Direct Evidence. You cannot reasonably deny that,

Yes, there's no question in my mind that it's direct evidence. But

&gt;&gt; Some actors can't read, or at least can't read well. Susan Hampshire,
&gt;&gt; a famous actress in Britain, has a good memory for lines but is
&gt;&gt; dyslexic. But even so, as you've said, he may have been able to read,

Likely, but not necessarily so. He may have had a very good or even

&gt;&gt;&gt; And the circumstantial evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelmingly suggests he attended the grammar school near his

Well, of course, we have lots of circumstantial evidence about the
earl too. Bags of it. Is that acceptable?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
&gt;&gt; attend grammar school. We simply don't know. That is one of the
&gt;&gt; reasons there is doubt among the different anti-Stratfordian groups
&gt;&gt; that he wrote the plays. His father was well to do but fell into
&gt;&gt; disgrace. And how do we know how ambitious he was? He seemed more
&gt;&gt; ambitious, according to the new Wood book and film, with regard to
&gt;&gt; making money. He did so, in the main part, by conducting illegal
&gt;&gt; transactions in fleece (Wood shows us the court records in his film).
&gt;&gt; This seems to suggest that teaching his son to read was not as high on
&gt;&gt; his list of priorities as teaching him to make money by nefarious
&gt;&gt; means. But this is just conjecture, as are most statements with regard
&gt;&gt; to Shakespeare and his family.

&gt; But he applied for a coat of arms, which indicates a desire for
&gt; status, and having sons who had schooling would then have been
&gt; considered a mark of status.

"/>

If it was a free school? Possibly. Elizabeth hit on an interesting
point a few days ago. If Shakespeare's family was Catholic, as Michael
Wood is now saying they were, might Will's father have kept him out of
school so he wouldn't be indoctrinated in the new religion?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, why didn't the herald who wrote contemptuously on a drawing of
&gt;&gt;&gt; his coat of arms that he was an actor make the stronger point that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; was an ILLITERATE actor?

&gt;&gt; Dunno. Perhaps Shakespeare wasn't obliged to write when in the
&gt;&gt; presence of the herald so the guy had no idea whether he could read or
&gt;&gt; write. Maybe the herald didn't guess that we would all be arguing over
&gt;&gt; his words four hundred years later and so was not scrupulous enough to
&gt;&gt; record every fact about the man. Have not seen this piece of
&gt;&gt; information before. Thank you.

&gt; But the herald wanted to show how wrong the other hearld was for
&gt; awarding the Shakespeare family a coat of arms; ergo, why didn't he
&gt; investigate Shakespeare sufficiently to find out he was illiterate
&gt; (and, according to Elizabeth and Richard Kennedy, a whoremaster)?

"/>

Dunno. He may have been too busy working on coats of arms for jump
ups. Nor can we be sure that gentle Will was a whoremaster at this
point. And of course, his being a whoremaster would be no bar to his
being a playwright. Thanks for all your points. Very interesting.

Not sure that we will ever know absolutely (in the sense that there is

think my point would be that there is enough doubt now to question
Will's authorship of the works, whether he could read or not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; You're right that we cannot conclude absolutely that he did, and I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm doing my best.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no record that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford attended school.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, that doesn't mean that he didn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you prove 'it doesn't mean that he didn't?'
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can reduce it to 'it means that he did' but then
&gt;&gt;&gt; you have to prove that 'he did.'

&gt;&gt; One can say &quot;it doesn't mean that he didn't,&quot; of course. There is no

&gt;&gt; I'm saying &quot;This means that he did.&quot; I'm clearly not. There is no

&gt; Any case that is 'made' is made at the expense of 'someone

"/>

I worded that poorly. I mean we don't need to take away points which

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Despite that reality, I have a different take on the authorship
&gt; dispute because I stay focused on the evidence. I'm prepared
&gt; at any time to abandon Bacon's authorship if Strats, Oxfordians

&gt; seen nothing from Marlovians or Oxfordians and nothing new
&gt; from Strats.

"/>

I feel the same way. But please visit our website at
, particularly the boards. There is a
wealth of discussion going on, even on the public boards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I would be sorry to give up Bacon's authorship. After
&gt; I got used to the idea that Bacon was Shakespeare and
&gt; started studying Bacon, I came to agree with his biographyer,
&gt; the repected classical scholar James Spedding who wrote,
&gt; 'Bacon is thrilling.'

"/>

Bacon is thrilling, but I don't think he wrote the canon, simply
because his known work and style is so very different from
Shakespeare's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Spedding was a conservative scholar, very
&gt; temperate in his statements, but in his one and only
&gt; outburst Spedding was right.

&gt; Bacon is thrilling.

&gt;&gt; The fact
&gt;&gt; that there is any kind of doubt that he did have a decent education is
&gt;&gt; what got all us anti-Strats started in the first place. That's all one
&gt;&gt; needs--doubt.

&gt; Doubt is the starting point. (That's got to be some
&gt; kind of cliche).

"/>

&quot;Doubt is the starting point&quot; is a cliche, I guess, or we just made it
one. But it's also the truth. There is doubt among many that
Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works. There is no such doubt about
Fielding, or Dickens, or countless others. There is a reason for this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not
&gt;&gt; have a grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by
&gt;&gt; way of a list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

&gt; There are two parts to the argument against the
&gt; Strat claim that their candidate was literate.

&gt; Part I: Strats have no evidence of literacy.
&gt; They make the limp argument that 'Shakespeare
&gt; wrote the Shakespeare plays--see, his name's
&gt; on the title page--so Shakespeare was literate .
&gt; That's called a circular argument.

"/>

Yes, have just seen a similar argument on John Kennedy's post.
However, the fact that it is a circular argument doesn't mean
Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't read.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Part II: The anti-Strats have a very good circumstantial
&gt; case against his literacy based on his sibs and childrens'
&gt; illiteracy, the fact that Catholics were reluctant to send
&gt; their sons to 'heretical' Anglican schools, the fact that
&gt; commoners' had only one book in the house, the bible,
&gt; and for Catholics the bible was on the Papal Index,
&gt; the fact that in six barbaric signatures he can't
&gt; spell his own name the same way twice, etc.

&gt; So we have zero evidence from the Strats to support
&gt; their claim VERSUS a good circumstantial case against
&gt; the Strat claim. Therefore, until Strats come up with
&gt; the evidence we are entitled to state that the Stratford
&gt; tradesman was illiterate. It goes without saying that
&gt; this is not an absolute statement since in a cause and
&gt; effect universe there are always surprises.

"/>

I cannot claim in good conscience that he was illiterate. I simply am
content to say that there is doubt about his literacy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Whether a grammar school education--which he may or may not have
&gt;&gt; had--would fit him to be the writer of the canon is another matter
&gt;&gt; entirely.

&gt; His education has to match the works and the
&gt; works are without doubt history's most erudite literary
&gt; works, so erudite they have inspired over a
&gt; hundred thousand PhD theses, over 300,000 books,
&gt; hundreds of thousands of articles and this is
&gt; doesn't count all the foreign scholarship on the
&gt; Shakespeare works.

"/>

Snip.

To my mind, that's where the argument is at. And there have been a
couple of really good papers published recently that show that the
author had to be a lawyer, that he must have understood the old legal
French, that some of the rulings which inform the plays were still in
manuscript form, etc. The knowledge of law exhibited in the plays is
so esoteric that Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't possibly have
picked it up at the tavern of universal knowledge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Otherwise we can assume that until Strats bring the
&gt;&gt;&gt; required proof forward we don't have to treat their
&gt;&gt;&gt; candidate as the author of the Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He may or may not have been illiterate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that, in terms of logic, is true, and if we
&gt;&gt;&gt; lived in common sense reality instead of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; nonsensical world of the Aristotelian syllogism,
&gt;&gt;&gt; we would do the right thing and put 'By Anonymous'
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the title pages of that body of works once
&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to a Stratford illiterate. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth

&gt;&gt; See, you've just admitted that he may or may not have been illiterate,
&gt;&gt; and then you call him &quot;a Stratford illiterate.&quot; How does one statement
&gt;&gt; follow the other?

&gt; Because the statement 'he may or may not have
&gt; been illiterate.' while technically true, is meaningless
&gt; in the context of the authorship dispute. Furthermore,
&gt; any candidate for Shakespeare authorship must be
&gt; *supremely literate.*

&gt; There can be no 300 years of dilly dallying about on
&gt; the question of whether or not the Stratford tradesman
&gt; could read or write his name.

&gt; The Shakespeare works demand a standard of genius
&gt; like no other body of works.

&gt;&gt; I must stop playing and go eat breakfast as it's almost lunchtime. My
&gt;&gt; excuse for play is that my research for my new novel hasn't arrived
&gt;&gt; yet.

&gt; I believe that one of your books got a good
&gt; review by someone in HLAS. Did you read the

Nope. Thank you for telling me. Which book was it?

Actually, you could have saved yourself a lot of writing if you had stopped
with that sentence, beause it pretty well sums up all the anti-stratfordian
arguments.

Most antiistrat arguments boil down to this: &quot;Since we simply don't know
about (fill in the blank), let us ignore everything we do know (i.e. all the
historical evidence and testimony) and fill in the unknown parts with
fantasies of who the writer of Shakepseare's works must have been. We simply
don't know, so it must have been Oxford, or Marlowe, or Bacon, or a group.&quot;

Show me one argument for an alternative author that is not essentially the
above.

You can't, because there are none.

If you have any desire at all TO know, you can go here,
, and be enlightened. Most
anti-strats, however, don't want to know. They'd rather live in their
fantasies.

On another thread, Mark Steese says, &quot;I have learned to live with the fact
that the only person you can ever know is lying is yourself.&quot; That is
conditionally true, but that doesn't mean that people don't lie to
themselves. I would suggest reading some Kierkegaard for an insight on how
anti-stratfordians can convince themselves to hold beliefs they know aren't
true.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
&gt;&gt;&gt; attend grammar school. We simply don't know. That is one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons there is doubt among the different anti-Stratfordian groups
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he wrote the plays. His father was well to do but fell into
&gt;&gt;&gt; disgrace. And how do we know how ambitious he was? He seemed more
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambitious, according to the new Wood book and film, with regard to
&gt;&gt;&gt; making money. He did so, in the main part, by conducting illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; transactions in fleece (Wood shows us the court records in his film).
&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to suggest that teaching his son to read was not as high on
&gt;&gt;&gt; his list of priorities as teaching him to make money by nefarious
&gt;&gt;&gt; means. But this is just conjecture, as are most statements with regard
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Shakespeare and his family.

&gt;&gt; But he applied for a coat of arms, which indicates a desire for
&gt;&gt; status, and having sons who had schooling would then have been
&gt;&gt; considered a mark of status.

&gt; If it was a free school? Possibly. Elizabeth hit on an interesting
&gt; point a few days ago. If Shakespeare's family was Catholic, as Michael
&gt; Wood is now saying they were, might Will's father have kept him out of
&gt; school so he wouldn't be indoctrinated in the new religion?

"/>

I doubt it. Adrian Quiney's son went to some school, we know, and it
could not have been a catholic school, and Quiney was a close friend
and business associate of John Shakespeare. Also, I think at least
one of the Stratford school masters was Catholic. I don't know enough
about the matter to do more than opine, though--and I really don't
think anyone else does, either, though many know more than I.

It's all trivial bsides the direct evidence, anyway.

Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
rational belief system? Even if it were entirely agnostic, there would
be a reason for that disjunction, too. I come by my doubts honestly.
Not because there's some secret joy in contrarianism or because it's
an easy topic to bicker over, but because the Life is incongruous with
the Works.

I remember as far back as grade school reading the introductory
biographies in my Momma's single-play editions and in the Cliff's
Notes and from bits and pieces of Marchette Chute (and Richard Armour,
for Christ's sake!) and thinking (or, maybe just feeling) that
something was wrong with the way this man's life was understood and
explained. Shakspere as Shakespeare, for as long as I can remember,
has been a chimera; his motivations seem artificial.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; fantasies of who the writer of Shakepseare's works must have been. We simply
&gt; don't know, so it must have been Oxford, or Marlowe, or Bacon, or a group.&quot;

"/>

This is typical Stratfordian hypocrisy. Look at what the orthodox have
done with the so-called Lost Years. What occupation for Shakspere
HASN'T been proposed to fill up that time? Then again, if Shakspere's
genius is of the kind that need only have progressed as far as junior
high (if that) to have been formally prepared to create even the early
plays, then why the need to attribute any travels or training in that
lost time to him at all? It wouldn't be for the recognition of the
paucity of his background otherwise, would it?

Then there is the diminution factor by which it is safe for even the
hardest of the hardcore orthodox to let slip some little doubt about a
scene here or a part there. &quot;He must have read it in manuscript.&quot;&quot;He
must have known it in translation (now lost).&quot;&quot;He collaborated
there.&quot;&quot;He punched that one up here.&quot;&quot;An inveterate borrower he.&quot;
&quot;Play-patcher, plot-cobbler, updater of all things Ur-.&quot; If you make
him play second fiddle too often, where does he get to shine? When
does he go solo? The only difference between a Stratfordian and an
Anti-Stratfordian is the degree to which they will permit the
Shakespearean Identity to disintegrate.

You assume too much, Tom. You suppose anything written by a so-called
contemporary was done without any guile or mercenary purpose. You
mistake the impersonal for the personal. You deny the plausible and,
therefore, can't even begin to acknowledge the theoretical basis of a
far more satisfying understanding of Shakspere's role in the
Elizabethan drama. Shakespeare as a name brand for England's leading
drama company is simply the better story.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Lynne has summed up the Stratfordian case, Reedy.

Strats really don't know if their candidate was literate or
not because they have no evidence one way or the other.

Anti-Strats, on the other hand, have good circumstantial
evidence that the Stratford tradesman was an illiterate.

Strat's have nothing to refute it. In 400 years of forging and
foraging legions of Strats have found n o t h i n g but
mouse turds to back up their claim that the tradesman was
literate.

holes were burned in the record just where Will Shakespear's

Baconians have (drum roll please) the Strachey letter.
The Strachey letter is a settled issue in Shakespeare scholarship.
It's requisite. Kathman couldn't defend it. Webb couldn't either.

In addition, Bacon mets every criteria for Shakespeare
authorship including intellectual greatness, patronage, motive,
opportunity, longevity, philosoph(ies), the right dialect, law, politics,
doctrine, biblical knowledge, was a 'concealed poet,' imprisoned
for debt by a 'hard Jew,' bailed out by Antonio, knew Digges,
Holland, Jonson--who worked for him after 1621--was an historian
(Henry VII), had an enormous vocabulary, spoke fluent French,
Italian, Latin, could write in various styles (Spedding), familiar
with Court etiquette, knew local dialects, knew Southampton
from childhood, lived in France, was famous as an orator,
(speeches in plays), was associated with the theatre, acted in at
least one play at Gray's Inn, wrote masques for Essex (Spedding)
and ad infinitum.

There is nothing in the Shakespeare works that disqualifies Bacon
and Bacon has everything required of the author including the Strachey
letter.

&gt;&gt; I would be sorry to give up Bacon's authorship. After

&gt; Bacon is thrilling, but I don't think he wrote the canon, simply

Bacon wrote almost exclusively in Latin. What we think of
as 'Bacon's style' is usually Robert Ellis, a very stiff Victorian
translator of Bacon's acknowledged works. Spedding would
quarrel with Ellis--they worked together for thirty years on
Bacon's biography but disliked one another--because Ellis
could not capture Bacon's imaginative metaphors. I believe
it was Spedding who said 'Bacon had the fine frenzy of a
poet.' (I had to look this up because that sounds too effusive
for Spedding but he did say it).

Bacon had all the natural faculties which a poet wants?
a fine ear for metre, a fine feeling from imaginative
effect in words and a vein of poetic passion......The
truth is that Bacon was not without the fine phrensy of
the poet.

Good grief! I've never seen *anyone* argue that Shakespeare must be
the author of the canon because he knew how to read! I cannot even
imagine the utterance of which the above is supposed to be a paraphrase,
nor can I find any likely candidate in John's post.

Shakespeare is regarded by experts in literary history as the author
of the works attributed to him because there is copious evidence of
various sorts for that attribution, NOT because anyone explicitly said
that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It is
likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have
been) spoke Greek fluently, although there is no documentary evidence
that he was raised in a Greek-speaking milieu, that he attended the
local grammar school, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We know he knew how to read because he was the author of the
&gt; canon. Well done.

If you'll reread John's post, I think you'll agree that the above is
not remotely what he said. In particular, John did not attempt to infer
Shakespeare's authorship of the canon from his supposed literacy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I've been called a sexist, a racist, and various other unflattering
epithets recently, and I am certainly not alone. Nor have I noticed
that the politeness of Mr. Crowley's surly, sour-grapes rants has much
improved -- indeed, you must have noticed yourself that Mr. Crowley
tends to credit anyone who does not share his perception (that the early
sonnets are addressed to the Queen, and that one of the later ones
immortalizes a defecation competition between Oxford and the Queen) with
roughly the intelligence of an annelid. Thus I'm not at all certain
that I can detect the supposed trend to which you allude.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The Shakespeare deniers do not use reasoned argument. They use

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again, I cannot see that John Kennedy called you a snob. Rather, he
referred collectively to &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; SOME of whom indeed
attempt -- not very persuasively -- to use non sequiturs, while others
resort to arguments based upon snob appeal. There are no h.l.a.s.
anti-Stratfordians whom I would actually label as liars (true, &quot;Dr.&quot;
Faker did claim to have a Ph.D., a claim which proved to be fraudulent,
but that claim was utterly pathetic in its desperation and in any case
was completely irrelevant to the argument concerning authorship, so I'm
disregarding it), as I suspect that most anti-Stratfordians ACTUALLY
BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,
etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the
tactics of &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; it does not follow that he is
referring to you specifically.

But some anti-Stratfordians apparently are NOT particularly
interested in Shakespeare. Indeed, when Mr. Streitz soberly informed us
that only one of Shakespeare's plays was set in a foreign country other
than Italy, someone asked (rhetorically) whether he had actually read
the plays. Mr. Streitz's reply was that he had read about half of them;
he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
means other than by reading the works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Thus I answere. First and formost, they haue cleansed our language
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from barbarisme and made the vulgar sort here in *London* (which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the fountaine whose riuers flowe round about *England*) to aspire to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; richer puritie of speach, than is communicated with the Comminaltie of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any Nation vnder heauen.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you can make 'vulgar sort' and 'comminalty' mean 'the nobility and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ladies and gentlemen of the court', good luck. If you can't...this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroup can tell who is bullshitting and who isn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, according to you, Nashe was telling us
&gt;&gt;&gt; that THEY read poetry and thereby learned to
&gt;&gt;&gt; speak with a better accent . . ?

&gt;&gt; Not according to me but according to Nashe - see above. Are you
&gt;&gt; quarrelling with an original source, Paul? You living in 21st century
&gt;&gt; Ireland are a greater authority on conditions in 16th century London
&gt;&gt; than a man living there?

&gt; Nashe was not engaged in presenting a flat
&gt; sociological report on the conditions of his
&gt; nation (such as would meet the standards of,
&gt; say, a 21st century Government investigation).
&gt; He was arguing a case, and pushing it to, and
&gt; beyond, all reasonable limits -- largely out of
&gt; a sense of fun. He was rarely 100% serious.
&gt; (Heck, he was rarely 20% serious!) I'm sure
&gt; he knew how bad his argument was. But if he
&gt; rushed on at a furious pace, no one would
&gt; notice -- after all, you didn't.

"/>

You know, when a post or two back you said 'I don't have Nashe', did
you mean you didn't have a copy of 'Pierce Penilesse' to hand? If so,
how is it that given a brief quote you are absolutely sure you can
interpret not only what the author *really* meant - according to you
the complete reverse of what he actually wrote - but also his motives
for writing it? This isn't so much literacy criticism as
clairvoyancy. It's fascinating. Do go on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Secondly, he was addressing courtiers, and by
&gt; 'the vulgar sort' he meant the next layer down --
&gt; the literate, aspiring middle-classes who were,
&gt; in fact, often trying to 'improve their speech'.
&gt; Some of them were buying books and, maybe
&gt; sometimes, even reading poetry.

"/>

Why would Nashe - the son of a country parson - describe the middle
class as 'the vulgar sort'? Moreover, how do you know he was
&quot;addressing courtiers&quot;? 'Pierce Penilesse' not only has no dedicatee,
Nashe actually writes at the end that he doesn't think it's worth
dedicating anything to courtiers because they never pay up: 'cap and
thankes is all our Courtiers payment&quot;. This was a commercial
pamphlet, available to anyone with a penny or two to spend and the
ability to read.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But the argument that poetry had 'made the
&gt; vulgar sort aspire to richer purity of speech'
&gt; is close to nonsense -- and IMO contained
&gt; about as much truth as it did in, say, the 1920s.

"/>

Paul, as you say, that's your opinion. Nashe differed. But why
should we pay any attention to what he wrote? You can assert it's
nonsense, and mention the 1920s (why?), so that handily disposes of
contemporary testimony. I understand now why you don't bother with
research. There isn't much need for you to consult historical texts at
all, is there? You can just decide what you think probably happened,
and that's that. Must save a lot of time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The pressures to 'talk proper' came from other
&gt; directions. Only a relatively small number
&gt; could manage to 'speak like the Queen',
&gt; without getting pulled back down by their
&gt; family and friends.
&gt; Maybe he thought he could get away with
&gt; such an argument because the courtiers
&gt; knew little of the lives of the middle-classes.
&gt; But, as I said before, it was mainly an
&gt; exercise in rhetoric -- where the pace and
&gt; fluency of the prose deceives the eye.

"/>

It isn't the eye he'd need to deceive, is it? More the ear. According
to you his prose was so spellbinding he could persuade courtiers that
their tailors, shoemakers, clerks and jewellers were speaking the same
way they were, whereas in reality they were all dropping their aitches
or grunting inarticulately. I always thought Nashe was a good writer,
but your opinion of him is off the scale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps they had poetry reading sessions
&gt;&gt;&gt; every day in every inn, and each learned
&gt;&gt;&gt; verses of some improving poetry off by heart . . ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you'd like to set out your scenario
&gt;&gt;&gt; for us?

&gt;&gt; No, I'd prefer to hear you explain why you know more about 16th
&gt;&gt; century London than Nashe. I await your reply with interest.

&gt; Very little in Nashe should be taken as the
&gt; straight reportage of facts.

&gt; Paul.

That sums it up. Your belief system is based on a mere opinion that

evidence that your belief system is wrong PLUS the preposterously

&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this

&gt; BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
&gt; of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,

&gt;&gt; Actually, many lies hurt no one. But nevertheless, people who are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, if you think you can get your point across better by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name calling,

&gt;&gt;&gt; The only &quot;point&quot; to be made was made centuries ago by Hemmings and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Condell, by Ben Jonson, and by others. The sick, twisted, evil people
&gt;&gt;&gt; who lie about Shakespeare and about them have have done nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; deserve the compliment of rational opposition.

&gt;&gt; The points that Jonson made are debatable and open to interpretation.
&gt;&gt; You might like to inform me as to the points that Hemminges and
&gt;&gt; Condell made. I'm not familiar with them--unless you're talking about
&gt;&gt; that little bit in the folio--and am always happy to learn.

&gt;&gt; If you believe that someone is sick, twisted, evil and a liar because
&gt;&gt; s/he holds a different point of view from your own on the Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; Authorship question, I feel very sorry for you. You are missing out on
&gt;&gt; so much, because there are so few of us genuinely interested in
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare and the Elizabethan era and we are much more alike than we
&gt;&gt; are different.

&gt; But some anti-Stratfordians apparently are NOT particularly
&gt; interested in Shakespeare. Indeed, when Mr. Streitz soberly informed us
&gt; that only one of Shakespeare's plays was set in a foreign country other
&gt; than Italy, someone asked (rhetorically) whether he had actually read
&gt; the plays. Mr. Streitz's reply was that he had read about half of them;
&gt; he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
&gt; author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
&gt; means other than by reading the works.

"/>

I don't find Mr. Streitz particularly representative of Oxfordians
though you have several times used him as an example. However, I do
find that there are anti-Stratfordians and Stratfordians alike who
know little about the plays. But I might add that on the whole, people
who believe that Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays are not in
the least interested in studying them. They have never questioned the
authorship or even thought about it, they may never have seen or read
one of the plays (except possibly in school), and they may never have
glanced at a sonnet. I do not include the Stratfordians on this
listserv in this observation, though I might add the Stratfordians on
this listserv are including these people when they say that the vast
majority believe that Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays.

&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt; rational belief system?

"/>

Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with Anti-Stratfordianism:
it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems, it
seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither reasonable
nor orderly. It was because of such rational belief systems that
mankind stood staring at nature for thousands of years without having
the least understanding of how it worked; it took Darwin, a man who was
willing to put the actual evidence of the world above his
preconceptions, to come up with the first accurate description of
evolution.

Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely to ever
acknowledge the essentially rational nature of Anti-Stratfordianism
because they too believe, wrongly, that the world can be explained by
reason. Perhaps it's more comfortable to believe the Antis are liars
and/or madmen than to acknowledge that they are neither; they are simply
rationalists whose particular rationalism is remarkably easy to argue
with (as opposed to, say, monotheists).

It's interesting to me that you persist in the assumption that because
you 'know' anti-Stratfordian beliefs are untrue, the anti-Stratfordians
must also know it. From the evidence presented here at hlas, I'd say
the majority of the antis do not know their beliefs aren't true, any
more than the majority of pros realize that their beliefs aren't true.

To me, it looks as though the real problem between the pros and the
antis is that their belief systems are too similar. Haven't you noticed
that many of the antis here express the belief that the pros have
convinced themselves &quot;to hold beliefs they know aren't true&quot;?

I don't think the people on either side are consciously or unconsciously
deceiving themselves. I think both sides have simply fallen victim to
the common human belief that the world is susceptible to rational
explanation; the only real difference is how they choose to rationalize
a thing that cannot be rationalized -- the accomplishment of
Shakespeare.

The pros reduce Shakespeare's accomplishment to fit their rational
version of Shakespeare; the antis reject the pros' rational version of
Shakespeare -- as they should -- but then proceed to seek a reasonable
author instead of acknowledging the unreasonable fact that Shakespeare
wrote his own works. To me it looks as though both sides cannot help
but trim the world to fit their perception of it. There's no surprise
in that; people capable of fitting their perception to the world are few
and far between.

&gt; The question of dialect is an interesting one. Although scholars have

The point is worthless in that the writer was inventing characters

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, I'd like to make a couple of observations:

&gt; 1. Noblemen in the sixteenth century were generally brought up by
&gt; local nannies who would be speaking the regional dialect. They would
&gt; then be tutored rather than going to school. I imagine their accents,
&gt; if still malleable, would rather depend on the accent of their tutor.

Accents? That would be from the player to the part. Not the writing
or dialect or phraseology.

&gt; 2. My husband taught at an English public school, Repton, in the
&gt; seventies. A public school in England is a private school where the
&gt; well-to-do send their children. It was our experience that children
&gt; coming into the prep (lower) boarding school at the age of seven often
&gt; spoke with regional accents, but their accents changed to what was
&gt; considered &quot;accentless&quot; English as they progressed at school. Since
&gt; noblemen in the sixteenth century generally did not attend school,
&gt; it's hard to know whether their accent would be that of their poorer
&gt; neighbours or something rather rarer that immediately identified them
&gt; as belonging to the upper classes. Perhaps an &quot;upper class&quot; accent
&gt; emerged later, as it became the habit to send the children of wealthy
&gt; parents to public schools, but that is only my conjecture.

"/>

We know that William's diction was acceptable to James.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Even up until and in the seventies, when I was living in England,
&gt; it was occasionally hard for me (a Londoner) to understand
&gt; accents/dialects of people from other places. I found the Newcastle
&gt; accent, for example, particularly hard to decipher. It is interesting
&gt; to note that this was at a time when dialect was attenuating, perhaps
&gt; because of the influence of TV and radio. I imagine someone from
&gt; Stratford in the sixteenth century spoke in a reasonably broad
&gt; dialect, as did those from other parts of England. However, people in
&gt; the southern states of the US still speak with a very different accent
&gt; from those who live in New York or Toronto. You will notice that
&gt; actors tend to smooth out their accents when acting on tv or film. I
&gt; see no reason why Shakespeare of Stratford could not have done
&gt; something similar.

"/>

Actors *play* the dialects for the character, silly.
Or they don't get the work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. Several people have suggested that the Earl of Oxford spoke and
&gt; wrote (his letters) in an English which showed evidence of dialect and
&gt; therefore he couldn't have written the canon. I think this is a
&gt; non-starter also, as though he may well have spoken a particular
&gt; dialect, his early published poems show no evidence of it. So either
&gt; he or a compositor &quot;regularised&quot; his English. The same may well be
&gt; true of the Shakespeare plays and poems so he cannot be disqualified
&gt; as the author on this basis. Neither, I suppose, can Shakespeare of

&gt; rather badly from jet lag and less than three hours of sleep).

Explain to Roger the difference between a character and the character's creator.

&gt;&gt; I would be sorry to give up Bacon's authorship. After
&gt;&gt; I got used to the idea that Bacon was Shakespeare and
&gt;&gt; started studying Bacon, I came to agree with his biographyer,
&gt;&gt; the repected classical scholar James Spedding who wrote,
&gt;&gt; 'Bacon is thrilling.'

&gt; Bacon is thrilling, but I don't think he wrote the canon, simply
&gt; because his known work and style is so very different from
&gt; Shakespeare's.

Read any poignant tin propositions lately?
I have evidence Oxford wrote them, whereas you only
wish you had evidence he wrote plays.

&gt;&gt; Spedding was a conservative scholar, very
&gt;&gt; temperate in his statements, but in his one and only

&gt;&gt; Bacon is thrilling.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is any kind of doubt that he did have a decent education is
&gt;&gt;&gt; what got all us anti-Strats started in the first place. That's all one
&gt;&gt;&gt; needs--doubt.

&gt;&gt; Doubt is the starting point. (That's got to be some
&gt;&gt; kind of cliche).

&gt;&quot;Doubt is the starting point&quot; is a cliche, I guess, or we just made it
&gt; one. But it's also the truth. There is doubt among many that
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works. There is no such doubt about
&gt; Fielding, or Dickens, or countless others. There is a reason for this.

A book here, a seminar there, a speaking engagement here, an association there
and it all starts to add up!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by
&gt;&gt;&gt; way of a list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

&gt;&gt; There are two parts to the argument against the
&gt;&gt; Strat claim that their candidate was literate.

&gt;&gt; Part I: Strats have no evidence of literacy.

This is a lie because an eyewitness said he wrote.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They make the limp argument that 'Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; wrote the Shakespeare plays--see, his name's

&gt;&gt; That's called a circular argument.

"/>

This is a lie and no one made the fictitious claim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, have just seen a similar argument on John Kennedy's post.
&gt; However, the fact that it is a circular argument doesn't mean
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't read.

GET REAL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Part II: The anti-Strats have a very good circumstantial
&gt;&gt; case against his literacy based on his sibs and childrens'
&gt;&gt; illiteracy,

This is a lie, a circular argument, and a disgrace to any thinking person.
Show the evidence the sibs or children were illiterate or drop it.

Dandy Oxenforde had the same problem, right, Elizabeth?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is an untruth, of course, because a writer and two players
called him a writer.

Your illiteracy crutch is a dud.

This is untrue. You NEED evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It goes without saying that

And that doubt is manufactured and maintained by people

Unlike you, your son is hurting no one else's reputation, he is entertaining,

To help your son and you see eye to eye, try what my parents tried

son that when mummy blows thousands of dollars to go to Carmel to
defame an author and give the credit to someone else without any
evidence at all that mummy is doing it to please herself and that that
simple personal pleasure of defaming Shakespeare is far more important
than any respect or logic or history or literature. He will definitely
understand you better. Heck, I do.

canon) is wearing very, very thin.

I have as much evidence that Bobby Kennedy wore a hairpiece as you
have that Oxford wrote Shakespeare, but I don't go to seminars out of
town to discuss it with similarly deluded individuals.

Oxfordians are the laughingstock of the detractors, you know. Bacon had
the brains and the timeframe. Marlowe had the talent and the experience.
But Oxford was washed up by '88. He wrote tin, oil, fruit, and wool
proposals when Shakespeare was writing the plays. You can verify this
at any library in the world, even Carmel.

&gt; Probably when a Shakespeare-denier presents a piece of direct evidence

&gt;&gt; I come by my doubts honestly.
&gt;&gt; Not because there's some secret joy in contrarianism or because it's

&gt;&gt; the Works.

&gt; That sums it up. Your belief system is based on a mere opinion that
&gt; reduces to your not liking Shakespeare of Stratford. That doesn't
&gt; make it irrational. What makes it irrational is that, for you, this
&gt; intuition of yours is sufficient to outweigh a huge amount of hard
&gt; evidence that your belief system is wrong PLUS the preposterously
&gt; tangled conspiracy theory that your belief system must force you to
&gt; accept in spite of there being NO direct or even anecdotal evidence of
&gt; it.

&gt; If Oxford had lived till 1616 and Shakespeare had died in 1604, then

anti-Stratfordians are based entirely on wishful thinking, not evidence.
The beliefs of Stratfordians are based on evidence, such as:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST

QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,

LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly ...

It seems they would not avoid the questions then, doesn't it? But when

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't think they are similar at all. Please elucidate. One is based upon

Sorry to tell you this, Mark, but a good part of the world and the behavior

successfully across a broad range of disciplines, both scientific and
philosophic.

&gt; wrote his own works. To me it looks as though both sides cannot help
&gt; but trim the world to fit their perception of it. There's no surprise
&gt; in that; people capable of fitting their perception to the world are few

And I suppose you could introduce me to one of the elect, right?

Your one-size-fits-all effort to explain the world in 25 words or less needs

&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with Anti-Stratfordianism:
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
logical
&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified. The problem, as
with
&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

&gt; I don't believe this is true.

"/>

You don't believe that the underlying belief systems of paranoid
schitzophenics are false? Do you think they are true? If they were true, the
behavior of schizophrenics would certainly be correct.

For example, let's say some unfortunate souls are stricken with the disease
and believe that God has told them to kill another person. The underlying
belief -- that God is talking to them -- is false, wouldn't you agree? But
if that belief were true -- that is, if they were not in actuality victims
of a mental disorder and if God were indeed talking to them, their homicidal
behavior would surely be correct and logical.

Similarly (and no, I'm not linking anti-stratfordians to homicidal
schizophrenics), the underlying beliefs of anti-stratfordians are false,
i.e. the works contain special knowledge only a noble could have known; a
middle-class person could not have become a literary genius in the
Elizabethan age in stratford; Shakespeare's family was comprised of ignorant
bumpkins; and so on, ad infinitum.

Now if all those assumptions were true, anti-stratfordianism would be a
correct response to those &quot;facts.&quot; As it is, however, those assumptions have
been easily refuted countless times by simply referring to the historical
record, yet anti-strats continue in their beliefs by using the tactic of
willfully ignoring the record and the refutations of their beliefs. So while
their authorship stance is certainly logical, growing out of their
assumptions, it is incorrect because those assumptions and beliefs are
false.

So the only explanation is that their beliefs satisfy some need in their
psyche. They persist in their beliefs not out of logic, but out of emotion.
And so their beliefs, while they can be refuted by logic and reality, can
never be changed by those tactics. The only way an emotional belief can be
changed is through another emotion. What emotion would be sufficient to
accomplish that, I don't know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Could you tell us which account of
&gt; schizophrenia (there are several) describes the disease as primarily &quot;the

I don't imply. I try to just state what I mean to say. Only fuzzy thinkers

I'm sure there is somewhere, but I'm not aware of where that place might be.

Have you ever thought about taking a course in logic and/or basic English?

about Shakespeare's comparative lack of education. He could have been
the most thoroughly educated man in England and his accomplishment would
not have been one whit less remarkable.

Nor do I find it surprising that you must put Shakespeare into a neat
little rational box. Talented, hard-working, period. And I'm sure that
you honestly believe that's all Shakespeare was. It's your loss, I'm
afraid.

She didn't know that he lied. She knew that what he said wasn't true. I

No. Both belief systems are based on the historical record, i.e., both
belief systems accept that there was a body of work attributed to
William Shakespeare. Both belief systems are fantasy in that they do
not deal with William Shakespeare, but rather a rationalized image of
the man. KQKnave provided a nice example of the pro-Stratfordian
fantasy when he claimed that Shakespeare was &quot;a talented, hard-working
man, period.&quot; That's the kind of tiny box some pro-Stratfordians want
to stuff Shakespeare into.

Whether or not that's true about philosophy, I couldn't say, but it's

&gt;&gt; The problem with what is an otherwise excellent essay is not that it
&gt;&gt; draws an unreasonable conclusion, but that it considers only the one
&gt;&gt; possible one, when there could be others. This is what I wrote in the
&gt;&gt;&quot;Shakespeare/Marlowe connection&quot; thread on March 15th, 2000.

&gt;&gt;&quot;In their *How we know that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare*, Tom
&gt;&gt; Reedy and Dave Kathman show beyond reasonable doubt that William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare from Stratford was the actor/shareholder in the
&gt;&gt; company which performed Shakespeare's plays. We may, I think,
&gt;&gt; therefore assume that he was also taken to be the author of them.

&gt; No, we don't &quot;assume that he was taken to be the author of them.&quot; We KNOW he
&gt; was &quot;taken to be the author of them&quot; by the direct evidence of title pages
&gt; and in both public and private contemporary testimony.

&gt;&gt; What their argument does nothing to eliminate, however, is the
&gt;&gt; possibility that he also had a ghost writer, and that this ghost
&gt;&gt; writer was Christopher Marlowe.

&gt; It also does not take into possiblity that he had a ghost writer by the name
&gt; of Mortimer K. Hockey also, not does it do anything to eliminate it.

&gt;&gt; Lack of evidence that he was is
&gt;&gt; regularly trotted out as an argument against this, but such a
&gt;&gt; lack of evidence is, of course, precisely what one would expect.

&gt; Remarkable. And you consider this -- what, exactly? Evidence? Refutation? A
&gt; flaw in the logic of the argument? (There's certainly no flaw in your logic,
&gt; that's for sure.)

&gt;&gt; Given the lack of evidence of so much that was *not* intended to
&gt;&gt; be a secret, we can hardly expect it to be lying around when it
&gt;&gt; would have been very important to some very powerful people that
&gt;&gt; such a secret should be kept.&quot;

&gt; That's what Mortimer said.

No, it's an irrational belief system because its premises are insane,
and it ignores facts contrary to those premises. It is, however,
rational (for the most part) in its use of logic, except that it uses
it inappropriately to try to explain every detail of its subject

do this.

Sorry, Mark, but SOME Shakespeare-deniers are definitely liars. And

rational.

Etymology: Middle English racional, from Latin rationalis, from ration-,
ratio
Date: 14th century
1 a : having reason or understanding b : relating to, based on, or agreeable
to reason : REASONABLE &lt;a rational explanation&gt;&lt;rational behavior&gt;

So science has nothing to do with reason or understanding? Then it must be
irrational, then.

Etymology: Middle English, from Latin irrationalis, from in- + rationalis
rational
Date: 14th century
: not rational: as a (1) : not endowed with reason or understanding (2) :
lacking usual or normal mental clarity or coherence b : not governed by or
according to reason &lt;irrational fears&gt;

So surely that quality must be in the definition of the word, &quot;science,&quot;
right?

Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin scientia, from
scient-, sciens having knowledge, from present participle of scire to know;
probably akin to Sanskrit chyati he cuts off, Latin scindere to split --
more at SHED
Date: 14th century
1 : the state of knowing : knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or
misunderstanding
2 a : a department of systematized knowledge as an object of study &lt;the
science of theology&gt; b : something (as a sport or technique) that may be
studied or learned like systematized knowledge &lt;have it down to a science&gt;
3 a : knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the
operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through
scientific method b : such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned

&gt;&gt; Most antiistrat arguments boil down to this: &quot;Since we simply don't know

simply

how
&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordians can convince themselves to hold beliefs they know

Pardon me, but from where I come from, we don't put words in other people's

&gt;&gt; on March 15th, 2000.

&gt;&gt;&quot;In their *How we know that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare*, Tom
&gt;&gt; Reedy and Dave Kathman show beyond reasonable doubt that William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare from Stratford was the actor/shareholder in the
&gt;&gt; company which performed Shakespeare's plays. We may, I think,

Yes possibly over-cautious on my part. I would still prefer to say

Indeed it doesn't. On the other hand, your essay was written with
the specific aim of showing why those believing that someone other
than Shakespeare wrote the works are wrong, and I am not aware
that anyone has proposed the elusive Mr. Hockey as a possibility.

My point is that I can happily accept all of the facts you present
in your essay, but come to an entirely different but equally
*logical* (I did not say equally probable) conclusion, and that
this shouldn't be possible if you are to claim to KNOW that yours
is the correct one.

I was answering Gary's question. It was not intended in any way
to present the case for an alternative, only to point out that,
as your essay does not in any way address my reasons for thinking
that Marlowe was a more likely author than Shakespeare (which are
well-known to you), and presents no evidence that I have not
already considered in reaching my conclusion, it is inadequate as
*proof*, which is how you seemed to present it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Given the lack of evidence of so much that was *not* intended to

Peter, I've long considered your approach to be the
cleverest approach used by anti-Stratfordians. Indeed,
given the evidence we have that logically links William
Shakespeare of Stratford to the author William Shakespeare,
it also strikes me as the *only* approach that should be
used by anti-Stratfordians.

But it's *not* the only approach used by
anti-Stratfordians. There are those who insist, in spite of
the evidence, that there are no logical evidentiary links
between 'the Stratford man' and the author. It is the
approach of these anti-Stratfordians that is blown out of
the water by the Reedy-Kathman essay, IMO.

An unsigned preface is not 'hard evidence,' Grumman.

What you had--until I passed it to the Baconians--was

Kathman's case against Oxfordian authorship is still
air tight. Any claim to Shakespeare authorship has
to be first grounded on the sine qua non of authorship,
the Strachey letter. Any other starting point is a waste

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Excellent argument. I'm only sorry I didn't see it before. Of course
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you must be right. Anyone who was an alderman's son and had access to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the fact that we _know_ that Shakespeare was an actor, a poet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a playwright, yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare must be the author of the canon because he knew how to

&gt;&gt; Good grief! I've never seen *anyone* argue that Shakespeare must be
&gt;&gt; the author of the canon because he knew how to read! I cannot even
&gt;&gt; imagine the utterance of which the above is supposed to be a paraphrase,
&gt;&gt; nor can I find any likely candidate in John's post.

&gt;&gt; Shakespeare is regarded by experts in literary history as the author
&gt;&gt; of the works attributed to him because there is copious evidence of
&gt;&gt; various sorts for that attribution, NOT because anyone explicitly said
&gt;&gt; that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
&gt;&gt; various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
&gt;&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt;&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
&gt;&gt; putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It is
&gt;&gt; likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have
&gt;&gt; been) spoke Greek fluently, although there is no documentary evidence
&gt;&gt; that he was raised in a Greek-speaking milieu, that he attended the
&gt;&gt; local grammar school, etc.
&gt; Please name the experts in literary history (as opposed to English

&gt;&gt; etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the

&gt; He said &quot;shakespeare-deniers&quot; and went on to generalise about them.

He did not use a universal quantifier. Rather, he noted that, as a
group, &quot;Shakespeare deniers&quot; reach various specious conclusions by means
of a variety of faulty modes of inference, including non sequiturs,
snobbery, and lying. While I tend to disagree about the supposed lying,
I note that even if I agreed, John's statement STILL need not mean that
EVERY anti-Stratfordian uses EACH of the modes of inference that John

OTHERS favor snobbery, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You don't know the definition of 'direct evidence,' Reedy.

Direct evidence is evidence that doesn't allow for inferences
because it's 'air tight.'

A manuscript in the author's hand that has been authenticated
beyond doubt by expert witnesses is the best 'direct evidence'
in an authorship dispute. Printed names on title pages are weak
evidence in an authorship dispute, especially in an era that
suffered from the stigma of print.

Strats like to duck 'stigma of print' but Bacon's father--
arguably the most capable mind of his generation--was
kicked off the Privy Council for two years because he
printed a legal work in the name of his law clerk and it was
only a commentary on a legal case, not poetry. If it had been
kept in manuscript he would have been commended. The
nobility thought printed books were trashy and postmodern

Farey, in my opinion, is wrong on this point. The Strats have

Strats have plenty of stuff but stuff is not enuff.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Given the lack of evidence of so much that was *not* intended to
&gt;&gt; be a secret, we can hardly expect it to be lying around when it
&gt;&gt; would have been very important to some very powerful people that
&gt;&gt; such a secret should be kept.&quot;

Farey is right on this point. The Strats have destroyed
much evidence, forged more and there are, in fact, various
establishments invested in maintaining the Stratford myth
to the point of supressing evidence. Longworth and moreover
the credible Cambridge scholar G. B. Harrison documented
the fact that establishment Strats would not give Longworth
access to documents she needed when she was writing about
the Stratford tradesman's Catholicism.

Much of the forging and destruction of documents has been
ad hoc. I doubt Her Majesty's Secret Service goes around
with a black attache case collecting anti-Strat evidence although
it's possible. The DNB reported that Queen Victoria threw
the *witnessed* document of Elizabeth and Leciester's secret
marriage into the fireplace at Penshurst saying--and I will
love this quote forever

History should remain as it is!

When an Establishment is is in place, everybody 'just knows'
not to pique it.

It doesn't have to be a formal conspiracy--Wilmot was
intimidated into destroying whatever Baconian evidence
he possessed just on the newspaper report of Strats rioting
at the Ipswich Philosophical Society.

Collier had a 'higher purpose' (British racist imperialism)
when he was despoiling the Strat record for all time
('we may never be able to determine which are forgeries
in the Strat record and which are not') and worse, we'll
never know what Collier destroyed when the record was
so virginally ripe with evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with

"/>

Anti-Stratfordianism:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
&gt;&gt; reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
&gt;&gt; logical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified. The problem, as
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't believe this is true.

&gt;&gt; You don't believe that the underlying belief systems of paranoid
&gt;&gt; schitzophenics are false? Do you think they are true? If they were true,
the
&gt;&gt; behavior of schizophrenics would certainly be correct.

&gt; I don't believe that paranoid schizophrenics are different from all the
&gt; other people in the world, who are not paranoid schizophrenics, for the
one
&gt; and only reason that the paranoid schizophrenics have a different belief
&gt; system.

"/>

Nor do I. If you got that impression from what I wrote, then your
comprehension is faulty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The other side of that is: I don't believe that people who have a
different
&gt; belief system from the majority are all paranoid schizophrenics.

"/>

Nor do I. If you got that impression from what I wrote, then your
comprehension is faulty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; What I do believe is that paranoid schizophrenia, as defined by medical
&gt; doctors, really has nothing to do with beliefs OR with the ability to cope
&gt; with wrong beliefs.

&gt;&gt; For example, let's say some unfortunate souls are stricken with the
disease
&gt;&gt; and believe that God has told them to kill another person. The
underlying
&gt;&gt; belief -- that God is talking to them -- is false, wouldn't you agree?
But
&gt;&gt; if that belief were true -- that is, if they were not in actuality
victims
&gt;&gt; of a mental disorder and if God were indeed talking to them, their
homicidal
&gt;&gt; behavior would surely be correct and logical.

&gt; In your scenario: (a) the person suffers from a disease, (b) the person
&gt; possesses the belief that they ought to take some action, (c) the person
&gt; possesses the belief that the action will kill another person, (d) the
&gt; person possesses the belief that the reason they ought to do this act is
&gt; that God specifically wants them to, (e) the person possesses the belief
&gt; that the reason they know what God wants them to do is that God's voice
&gt; spoke to them.

&gt; Replace &quot;God&quot; in that paragraph with &quot;my commanding officer.&quot; It's still
&gt; logical, so the previous one is also logical.

"/>

Indeed, that was my point.

However, there are additional

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; beliefs (and also facts) that would make this illogical.

"/>

No, there aren't, not if that is what the individual suffering from mental
disease believes. There are additional beliefs and facts held by others
that would make it illogical, and insane, but we are not including any
otheres in the example.

(There are, in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; most cases, I think, different from the beliefs that would make the
original
&gt; paragraph illogical.) It's my impression that if the result is illogical,

"/>

But the result is logical according to the belief system, which is unmoored
from what we commonly agree as reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the person is more likely to be insane than if the result is logical,
though
&gt; for some diseases this might not be the case.

"/>

You know I believe? I believe you don't really understand my argument or my
example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Similarly (and no, I'm not linking anti-stratfordians to homicidal
&gt;&gt; schizophrenics), the underlying beliefs of anti-stratfordians are false,
&gt;&gt; i.e. the works contain special knowledge only a noble could have known;
a
&gt;&gt; middle-class person could not have become a literary genius in the
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan age in stratford; Shakespeare's family was comprised of
ignorant
&gt;&gt; bumpkins; and so on, ad infinitum.

&gt; Perhaps someone with more experience with rational/irrational belief
&gt; systems, like a belief in &quot;flying saucers,&quot; could better say whether these
&gt; are really similar to one another. My impression is they're not.

"/>

I did not say they were. I was illustrating the logic of each belief system
and how the results are incorrect because the assumptions are wrong, even
though the process is logical.

What is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; _usually_ said here in hlas is much more &quot;squishy&quot; than that kind of
insane
&gt; rational belief system.

&gt; What I'd call an example of an insane rational belief system: About ten
&gt; years ago (for all I know this topic is still cropping up), I saw a
&gt; discussion on Usenet, of gasoline prices at full-service versus self-serve
&gt; stations. In New Jersey, self-serve was against the law; in Pennsylvania,
&gt; just across the border, self-serve was permitted and was significantly
&gt; cheaper than full-service. Various acolytes of the late Ayn Rand were
&gt; arguing that people local to the area must have been lying, when they said
&gt; that full-service gasoline was no more expensive in New Jersey than
&gt; self-serve was in Pennsylvania. Their logic told them that the price must
&gt; have been higher.

"/>

You seem to have a special talent for non sequiturs. Or maybe your thinking
processes are just so far above everyone else's we just can't grasp your
point?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Now if all those assumptions were true, anti-stratfordianism would be a
&gt;&gt; correct response to those &quot;facts.&quot; As it is, however, those assumptions
have
&gt;&gt; been easily refuted countless times by simply referring to the
historical
&gt;&gt; record, yet anti-strats continue in their beliefs by using the tactic of
&gt;&gt; willfully ignoring the record and the refutations of their beliefs. So
while
&gt;&gt; their authorship stance is certainly logical, growing out of their
&gt;&gt; assumptions, it is incorrect because those assumptions and beliefs are
&gt;&gt; false.

&gt; It's not my impression that the statements have been refuted,

"/>

Your impression is wrong, of course, although I wouldn't expect you to
understand that.

though this

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; appears to be believed by those like John W. Kennedy who throw fits and
&gt; name-call whenever you contradict them.

&gt;&gt; So the only explanation is that their beliefs satisfy some need in their
&gt;&gt; psyche. They persist in their beliefs not out of logic, but out of
emotion.
&gt;&gt; And so their beliefs, while they can be refuted by logic and reality,
can
&gt;&gt; never be changed by those tactics. The only way an emotional belief can
be
&gt;&gt; changed is through another emotion. What emotion would be sufficient to
&gt;&gt; accomplish that, I don't know.

&gt; No. It is not the case that if a person has not persuaded Tom Reedy, then
&gt; that person must be illogical.

It just keeps getting better and better.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Excellent argument. I'm only sorry I didn't see it before. Of course
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you must be right. Anyone who was an alderman's son and had access to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the fact that we _know_ that Shakespeare was an actor, a poet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a playwright, yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare must be the author of the canon because he knew how to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good grief! I've never seen *anyone* argue that Shakespeare must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; the author of the canon because he knew how to read! I cannot even
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine the utterance of which the above is supposed to be a paraphrase,
&gt;&gt;&gt; nor can I find any likely candidate in John's post.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare is regarded by experts in literary history as the author
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the works attributed to him because there is copious evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; various sorts for that attribution, NOT because anyone explicitly said
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt;&gt;&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
&gt;&gt;&gt; putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been) spoke Greek fluently, although there is no documentary evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he was raised in a Greek-speaking milieu, that he attended the
&gt;&gt;&gt; local grammar school, etc.

&gt;&gt; Please name the experts in literary history (as opposed to English
&gt;&gt; professors, etc.)you are referring to.

&gt; You could start with E.K. Chambers, whose two-volume compilation of
&gt; the documentary evidence and pertinent commentary is pretty complete.

I read that ages ago. I was actually at the university next door to
his. Something more recent, perhaps?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We know he knew how to read because he was the author of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; canon. Well done.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you'll reread John's post, I think you'll agree that the above is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not remotely what he said. In particular, John did not attempt to infer
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's authorship of the canon from his supposed literacy.

&gt;&gt; I was being ironic. Good grief, Charlie Brown? Ever heard of that? But
&gt;&gt; the Will Shakespeare argument does tend to be circular.

&gt; There is NOTHING circular about what John wrote, because John did NOT
&gt; attempt to deduce Shakespeare's authorship of the canon from his
&gt; literacy. That was your contribution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you. You may not have noticed that the tendency on hlas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has been to attempt to be polite, use reasoned argument,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been called a sexist, a racist, and various other unflattering
&gt;&gt;&gt; epithets recently, and I am certainly not alone. Nor have I noticed
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the politeness of Mr. Crowley's surly, sour-grapes rants has much
&gt;&gt;&gt; improved -- indeed, you must have noticed yourself that Mr. Crowley
&gt;&gt;&gt; tends to credit anyone who does not share his perception (that the early
&gt;&gt;&gt; sonnets are addressed to the Queen, and that one of the later ones
&gt;&gt;&gt; immortalizes a defecation competition between Oxford and the Queen) with
&gt;&gt;&gt; roughly the intelligence of an annelid. Thus I'm not at all certain
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I can detect the supposed trend to which you allude.

&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps I should say that in the main people here are more
&gt;&gt; polite to me--with the exception of Paul, of course.

&gt; Don't take it personally, Lynne. Mr. Crowley has been displaying his
&gt; *barnacle's brain, wrapped in a pit bull's hide* to all and sundry for
&gt; years.

&gt;&gt; Some have even
&gt;&gt; (almost) realised that I'm a human being. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Shakespeare deniers do not use reasoned argument. They use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; snobbery, non-sequiturs, and outright lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We're not in the least Shakespeare deniers. We just believe in an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternative Shakespeare. By the way, I'm known for my non-sequiturs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they drive my husband crazy,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Non sequiturs can be amusing, but they are seldom very persuasive
&gt;&gt;&gt; grounds on which to base a complex argument.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely not. I was attempting humour to leaven Mr. Kennedy's
&gt;&gt; nastiness. Are you suggesting he was using complex argument?

&gt; No; I am suggesting rather that John is correct in noting that some
&gt; anti-Stratfordians attempt to make complex arguments based almost
&gt; entirely upon non sequiturs. Have you ever read some of Stephanie
&gt; Caruana's most memorable threads? Indeed, non sequiturs were second
&gt; only to errors in Stephanie's arguments -- for a sample of the latter,
&gt; see the factoids Stephanie posted during her notorious Reign of Error
&gt; (now remembered only by the connoisseurs of comedy, Stephanie's
&gt; contribution to the genre having been effortlessly eclipsed by
&gt; Elizabeth's _ouevre_).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you're the first person ever to call
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me a snob.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I cannot see that John Kennedy called you a snob. Rather, he
&gt;&gt;&gt; referred collectively to &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; SOME of whom indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt -- not very persuasively -- to use non sequiturs, while others
&gt;&gt;&gt; resort to arguments based upon snob appeal. There are no h.l.a.s.
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians whom I would actually label as liars (true, &quot;Dr.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Faker did claim to have a Ph.D., a claim which proved to be fraudulent,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but that claim was utterly pathetic in its desperation and in any case
&gt;&gt;&gt; was completely irrelevant to the argument concerning authorship, so I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding it), as I suspect that most anti-Stratfordians ACTUALLY
&gt;&gt;&gt; BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the
&gt;&gt;&gt; tactics of &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; it does not follow that he is
&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to you specifically.

&gt;&gt; He said &quot;shakespeare-deniers&quot; and went on to generalise about them.

&gt; He did not use a universal quantifier. Rather, he noted that, as a
&gt; group, &quot;Shakespeare deniers&quot; reach various specious conclusions by means
&gt; of a variety of faulty modes of inference, including non sequiturs,
&gt; snobbery, and lying. While I tend to disagree about the supposed lying,
&gt; I note that even if I agreed, John's statement STILL need not mean that
&gt; EVERY anti-Stratfordian uses EACH of the modes of inference that John
&gt; enumerated; rather, SOME anti-Stratfordians use non sequiturs, while
&gt; OTHERS favor snobbery, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
&gt;&gt;&gt; author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
&gt;&gt;&gt; means other than by reading the works.

Oh, were you expecting an answer this time, Tom? Sorry. It's so hard
to know when you do want one or when you prefer to answer your
questions yourself.

By the way, when you talk of fantasy based on ignorance, it says more
about you than it does about me. If you start out from that position,
it's clear as glass that you will never learn anything.

&gt;&gt; understand that my use of the pronoun *we* was meant to refer to
&gt;&gt; Stratfordians and anti-Stratfordians alike.

You can't stifle dissent but a manuscript in the hand

I was convinced by Strats that there was no 'stigma of print'
but there definitely was.

There's a work on dedications and commendatory letters
between 1560 and 1640--the author, Richard Franklin, went
through 35,000 books in British and American collections
and found the use of pseudonyms and initials or writing
behind other names in some cases, was huge in that era.
Aristocrats were very distainful of books, the nasty inky

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with
&gt;&gt; Anti-Stratfordianism:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems,
it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified. The problem,
as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

true,
&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't believe that paranoid schizophrenics are different from all the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I do believe is that paranoid schizophrenia, as defined by medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; doctors, really has nothing to do with beliefs OR with the ability to
cope
&gt;&gt;&gt; with wrong beliefs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, let's say some unfortunate souls are stricken with the
&gt;&gt; disease
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and believe that God has told them to kill another person. The
&gt;&gt; underlying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; belief -- that God is talking to them -- is false, wouldn't you agree?
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if that belief were true -- that is, if they were not in actuality
&gt;&gt; victims
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a mental disorder and if God were indeed talking to them, their
&gt;&gt; homicidal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior would surely be correct and logical.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In your scenario: (a) the person suffers from a disease, (b) the person
&gt;&gt;&gt; possesses the belief that they ought to take some action, (c) the
person
&gt;&gt;&gt; possesses the belief that the action will kill another person, (d) the
&gt;&gt;&gt; person possesses the belief that the reason they ought to do this act
is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that God specifically wants them to, (e) the person possesses the
belief
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the reason they know what God wants them to do is that God's voice
&gt;&gt;&gt; spoke to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Replace &quot;God&quot; in that paragraph with &quot;my commanding officer.&quot; It's
still
&gt;&gt;&gt; logical, so the previous one is also logical.

&gt;&gt; Indeed, that was my point.

&gt; I couldn't tell from what you wrote whether you had any idea at all of a
&gt; specific meaning for &quot;rational&quot; or &quot;logical.&quot; How was I to know that was
&gt; your point?

&gt;&gt; otheres in the example.

&gt; There are additional beliefs, (f), (g), and so forth, that if all
possessed

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Similarly (and no, I'm not linking anti-stratfordians to homicidal

false,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. the works contain special knowledge only a noble could have
known;
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; middle-class person could not have become a literary genius in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabethan age in stratford; Shakespeare's family was comprised of
&gt;&gt; ignorant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bumpkins; and so on, ad infinitum.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps someone with more experience with rational/irrational belief

&gt;&gt; I did not say they were. I was illustrating the logic of each belief

said

This question has arisen before, and anti-Stratfordians have been
challenged to present evidence of ELIZABETHANS who were illiterate yet
&quot;learned to write their own names so they could sign a document, etc.&quot;
As far as I know, nobody has offered a shred of evidence that such
persons existed. Morever, in view of the fact that writing was
customarily taught much later than reading at the time, the supposed
existence of such functionally illiterate signatories seems dubious in
the extreme. Matters being so, John Kennedy seems quite justified in
his remark. Indeed, to the best of my admittedly limited knowledge as
well, it is indeed an anti-Stratfordian fantasy. I hope that one of the
experts (Dave Kathman?) may chime in here with more authoritative

I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.
Rather, the natural implication of what John said is that it is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think not, Grumman. He had a Warwickshire (Saxon) dialect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and he had to lose it and acquire an East Midlands
&gt; barely-inflected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect, somehow acquire a 29,000 word vocabulary in it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, this is new to me: you're saying his &quot;dialect&quot; didn't have
&gt; words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in common with &quot;English.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; His 'dialect' had words in common with English because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anglo-Saxon is the basic German-Danish dialect (the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Angles or 'Englisc' as they called themselves and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect, were more Danish than German) but English got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a 'double dose of Danish' with the Danelaw.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The effect of the Danelaw--an artificial situation caused
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a treaty which pushed the Danes mainly into East Anglia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but also into Yorkshire--was to eventually STRIP the Anglo-Saxon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect of its German inflections and ADD more Danish to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the OE vocabulary transforming it to ME. Since there was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no BBC to standardize the 'presige' East Midlands dialect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the shires, which even today stubbornly hang on to their dialects
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to some extent, didn't have to give up their dialects. OE was still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spoken in some shires until the 1800s.

To begin your answer to my the question that way reveals an arrogance
about the subject as shallow as Crowley's.

That said...thanks for delivering the goods. See, I have this naive(?)
faith in Elizabeth, in her intellectual honesty and integrity. Webb
says its misplaced, but I figure she'd hardly say people were still
speaking vestiges of Old English into the 1700's in some parts of
England if it weren't true. Wait a minute, she didn't say vestiges,
she said they were speaking OE. Did she just make it up?!? Say it
ain't so, Liz.

Old English as a spoken language was dead before 1000, though

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; scribal conservatism preserved many of its inflexional forms for a few
&gt; decades beyond that date (the evidence for this is the apparent rapidity of
&gt; its collapse after the Norman Conquest: what changed so rapidly was not the

&gt; standard).

&gt; Now there is nothing wrong with ignorance: every one of us is profoundly
&gt; ignorant about most things: it's inevitable. But sane people are generally
&gt; capable of recognising where their ignorance lies; what distinguishes
&gt; anti-Strat nutters like Crowley, Weir and Kennedy is their grotesque and

another question, if you don't mind.

Is it not true that William grew up speaking the Warwickshire dialect?
From what I understand, English wasn't part of the grammar school
curriculum. So where/how'd William acquire the educated language of
*Venus &amp; Adonis* and *Lucrece*?

But (to belabour this point, because I think it's important)
the name 'William Shakespeare' on the title page is, by
itself, evidence that the work was written by someone named
William Shakespeare. And the fact that the guy from
Stratford was named William Shakespeare (or some variation
thereof, taking into account the looseness of Elizabethan
spelling) is at least a point in his favour, even if it
isn't conclusive proof. Agreed?

&gt;I was convinced by Strats that there was no 'stigma of print'

Why do you spend so much time arguing with anti-Stratfordians if you
believe this of them? For my own part, I can see no point in trying to
argue with proponents of a belief system with insane premises, but I
gather that you feel differently. What point do you see to it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem, as with anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying

&gt;&gt;&gt; So now hlas has *two* experts on paranoid schizophrenia? Remarkable.

&gt;&gt; So now one more hlas participant can be added to the list of those who
&gt;&gt; put words in people's mouths. I wouldn't say that was remarkable at
&gt;&gt; all, just sad.

&gt; Well, sure -- that's easier than defending your claims about paranoid
&gt; schizophrenia.

&gt;&gt; The notion that a person making an observation on a topic is claiming
&gt;&gt; to be an expert on that topic is what is remarkable.

&gt; Tom, you like dictionary definitions, so here's one for you, free of
&gt; charge:

&gt;&quot;irony. 1. a. The use of words to express something different from and
&gt; often opposite to their literal meaning.&quot;

&gt; You see, I didn't think you were claiming to be an expert at all! Now,
&gt; the funny part is that if an expert in paranoid schizophrenia had made
&gt; the flat statements of fact that you made, his or her expertise would
&gt; lend credence to what are, on their face, improbable assertions. When a
&gt; professed non-expert (such as you) makes such statements, their
&gt; improbability suggests that said non-expert is mistaken.

&gt;&gt; By that standard, I guess you're an expert on the world, reality and
&gt;&gt; everything in it, judging from your last post.

&gt; I'm exactly as much of an expert on those subjects as you are on mental
&gt; illness, so I hope you will not take it much amiss if I find your
&gt; statements about schizophrenia as dismissible as you find my musings on
&gt;&quot;the world, reality and everything in it.&quot;

"/>

I am by no means an expert on mental illness, but I know something about it,
having worked with people who had varying degrees of mental illness for more
than two decades. My statement stands; paranoid schizophrenia is extremely
rational and logical -- or perhaps I should say it slavishly follows its own
internal logic? -- once the underlying belief system has been identified.

I'm not going to start a Web site war, but you might check out a few such as

0092398.PDF, which states, among other things, &quot;It [paranoid schizophrenia]
is a disorder of the belief system.&quot;

Or this one,  , which says, &quot;It has its
own, internal logic, but a logic that resists all reason from the outside.&quot;

This one,

.html , will sound familiar. &quot;Typically, in schizophrenia, delusions tend to
be very bizarre and even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the
contrary, a person will not give up these beliefs . . . . Patients can
either be entirely incoherent to the point that we can't understand them or,
more typically, patients may have subtle idiosyncratic logic which makes
their speech seem peculiar and illogical.&quot;

All of these were written by people with intimate knowledge of the disease,
but only one is a &quot;recognized expert.&quot;

Since this is very off-topic (my point in bringing it up was to illustrate
that rationality and logic are not necessarily gurantors of the truth, which
I suspect is close to your original point, also), contact me off-line if you
wish to continue this particular conversation.

&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt; Probably when a Shakespeare-denier presents a piece of direct evidence
&gt; that Shakespeare was not Shakespeare.

"/>

Still having trouble with names, I see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I come by my doubts honestly.
&gt;&gt; Not because there's some secret joy in contrarianism or because it's
&gt;&gt; an easy topic to bicker over, but because the Life is incongruous with
&gt;&gt; the Works.

&gt; That sums it up. Your belief system is based on a mere opinion that
&gt; reduces to your not liking Shakespeare of Stratford.

"/>

That's a silly inference. I dislike Shakspere as a person because I
cannot match the facts of his life to the works credited to him? It
could well be that the historical Shakspere is a guy worth knowing, if
only for his con artistry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That doesn't
&gt; make it irrational.

"/>

As you conceive, it DOES.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What makes it irrational is that, for you, this
&gt; intuition of yours is sufficient to outweigh a huge amount of hard
&gt; evidence that your belief system is wrong PLUS the preposterously
&gt; tangled conspiracy theory that your belief system must force you to
&gt; accept in spite of there being NO direct or even anecdotal evidence of
&gt; it.

"/>

Then you don't get anything. Why am I not allowed to think of
Shakspere as a front for a small group of ghostwriters who, to this
very day, have not been affirmatively identified? I concede that
Shakspere was an actor and a sharer who, by virtue of that very
proximity, was well-placed to be considered (ALBEIT WRONGLY) the
playwright-poet Shakespeare. He is a &quot;fellow&quot; to a lot of actors and
sharers, but not so much a fellow to Jonson until we've passed the
point of contradiction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If Oxford had lived till 1616 and Shakespeare had died in 1604, then

This only shows how superficial your understanding of the chronology

dissent over Shakespeare's Identity.

That doesn't even make sense. Paranoid schizophrenia is the result of
organic imbalances in the brain. You think it's governed by some
belief system? Belief systems may be conceived and followed in the
schizophrenic mind with a great degree of rational consistency, but
not for long. Not when the context of the schizophrenic's life, as it
almost certainly would be, is known. For example, I once knew a man
who lived his whole life in campus coffeehouses, singing and playing
guitar, bumming cigarettes and change, stinking, being a goddamned
genius. His name was Keith. Keith explained how the U.S. Constitution
is a fine demonstration of Newtonian mechanics, with all its checks
and balances and proportionalism. Schizophrenic? I would guess so. And
I won't say it doesn't matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The problem, as with
&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

"/>

If I say Shakspere was a front-man for a small group of well-placed
ghostwriters, how can you deny that? I don't deny that he was an actor
and that he was a shareholder, so how can you DENY that such a person
would have been PERFECTLY qualified to have served in the role of a
front? Are you saying that it is absolutely impossible that some
direct and affirmative evidence of such an arrangement would NOT have
survived? Well, that's irrational. Secret arrangements are usually
orally made, right? Why should I expect to see some document outlining
his role as a front? That's irrational. And, yet, it is perfectly
rational to expect that a man of letters should have left behind some
stronger trace of his literary life than did Shakspere, but where are
those pieces of evidence? You and Kathman and whoever else can cluck
and chirp all you want about what should and should not be expected
for a man of that station and time, but I just want a piece of
manuscript. A single fucking letter. A dog-eared book. Oh, well...back
to stew in my irrationality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It was because of such rational belief systems that
&gt;&gt; mankind stood staring at nature for thousands of years without having

&gt;&gt; preconceptions, to come up with the first accurate description of
&gt;&gt; evolution.

"/>

There's something wrong with your analogy, Mark, but I'm not smart
enough to say what it is. Obviously, prehistoric man DID know a lot
about how Nature worked, even if it wasn't at a level of theoretical
sophistication with natural selection. But even rational (or,
empirical) good sense can divine why square pegs don't go in round
holes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely to ever

&gt;&gt; Oh, were you expecting an answer this time, Tom? Sorry. It's so hard
&gt;&gt; to know when you do want one or when you prefer to answer your
&gt;&gt; questions yourself.

&gt; You are so cute and clever, it's a shame you can't produce any substantive
&gt; argument.

"/>

Thank you. That's so sweet. I have produced argument on other threads
about various things, Ben Jonson, The Merchant of Venice, etc. There's
really no point to putting down the main arguments for Oxford here as
you've already seen them. Some new material should be coming out
shortly. Mark Anderson is writing what looks to be an excellent book,
and the excerpts I've heard from Richard Roe about Shakespeare in
Italy are fantastic. Unfortunately neither of these books are yet
published, but I believe they will cause a stir.

If you doubt that I know the arguments for Oxford, read my young adult
novel on Oxford and Shakespeare, A Question of Will. I'll be glad to
send you a copy if you email me privately. Most people will tell you
it's an entertaining read. At the end there is a two page summary of
why I think the Earl of Oxford wrote the works. The summary is aimed
at kids, but nevertheless it encapsulates the main arguments. You
might also look at the Fellowship site:
if you want to know some of the reasons I support Oxford as the best
candidate. I find the 25 Connections by Mark Alexander excellent, as
he entirely uses Stratfordian scholars to make the Oxfordian case.
There's some other good material in the Fellowship Virtual Classroom
and you might also look at the FAQ. Also, for members, there's major
discussion going on about various Oxfordian matters on the forum. Non
members can get a look in on the public boards. Now I have done
exactly what you have done, as instead of giving your arguments you
have produced the url of a page with your *facts* on them rather than
listing them all here, which I believe you rightly understand would be
tedious.

Unlike some others here, I find it unnecessary (and rather
exhausting)to bring out the arguments for my candidate, like producing
a rabbit out of a hat, every time I'm challenged to. Besides, it's
merely an invitation for Stratfordians to deride them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; By the way, when you talk of fantasy based on ignorance, it says more

I've produced my argument. I sell it in the stores. I've worked on the
Fellowship website and forum. I help to organize conferences where
other people produce yet more argument. I think that's enough, don't
you? Do you ask Kathman or Ross to produce their argument every time
they come online?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most antiistrat arguments boil down to this: &quot;Since we simply don't

"/>

But if I give you titles, that will merely give you the opportunity to
insult me and the authors. However, if you really don't know anything
about Oxford, which I highly doubt, I suggest you start with Richard
Whalen's book. It's a good basic introduction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But if
&gt;&gt; your mind is closed to begin with, it's hardly worth my mentioning

&gt; For your information, I was once intrigued by the idea of an alternative

&gt; fantasy based on ignorance and willful misinterpretation of the historical
&gt; record (see Price for a good example). I'm still waiting for the first piece
&gt; of evidence for an alternative author, the same as you are. You're satisfied
&gt; with unfounded speculation; I'm not. That's the difference between us.

"/>

No, Tom, I've never said I'm satisfied with anything. That I think
that Oxford is the best candidate doesn't mean I wouldn't change my
mind if something (or someone) else came along to persuade me. Terry
Ross's argument about the black swan on the fellowship boards has
caused me to change my mind about the poem. But at the moment I think
the facts for Shakespeare of Stratford are weak, there are too many
gaps, and what we know of him does not fit what we read in the canon.
But I'm open to persuasion. Wood's new book and film only drove me
further away, as they suggest that Shakespeare was a Catholic, and I
don't see the author of the canon as Catholic. Nelson's new book about
Oxford has a wealth of facts about the earl in it, but his main
argument that Oxford didn't write the canon seems to be that Oxford
was an unpleasant man. That gets us precisely nowhere.

&gt; the
&gt; fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the only person you can ever know is lying is yourself.&quot; That
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conditionally true, but that doesn't mean that people don't lie to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves. I would suggest reading some Kierkegaard for an insight
&gt; on
&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordians can convince themselves to hold beliefs they know
&gt; aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are saying, I suppose, that anti-Stratfordians are not educated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enough to have read Kierkegaard without your suggesting it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pardon me, but from where I come from, we don't put words in other
&gt; people's
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouths. I realize that is a favored debating technique for anti-strats,

&gt; any other antistratfordian have on your side, don't we, since you don't have
&gt; even one?

"/>

I don't? That's news to me. I'm also alarmed at the number of books on
Shakespeare of Stratford that employ the terms &quot;could have, should
have, would have.&quot; Wood is particularly fond of &quot;would have&quot; in his

&gt; Why wait and go to all that expense? Lay out your argument here, if you have

&gt;&gt; How clever of you to point that out, John. Thank you. My husband
&gt;&gt; teaches grade one and has noticed that children can almost always
&gt;&gt; write their own name before they can read. Most of them go on to
&gt;&gt; become literate. However, even in this day and age, some do not.

&gt; This question has arisen before, and anti-Stratfordians have been
&gt; challenged to present evidence of ELIZABETHANS who were illiterate yet
&gt;&quot;learned to write their own names so they could sign a document, etc.&quot;
&gt; As far as I know, nobody has offered a shred of evidence that such
&gt; persons existed. Morever, in view of the fact that writing was
&gt; customarily taught much later than reading at the time, the supposed
&gt; existence of such functionally illiterate signatories seems dubious in
&gt; the extreme. Matters being so, John Kennedy seems quite justified in
&gt; his remark. Indeed, to the best of my admittedly limited knowledge as
&gt; well, it is indeed an anti-Stratfordian fantasy. I hope that one of the
&gt; experts (Dave Kathman?) may chime in here with more authoritative
&gt; information.

"/>

But the problem is that there couldn't be a shred of evidence that
such persons didn't exist, whatever David says. If we have a signature
and no other written material (as in the case of Shakespeare of
Stratford, by the way) we have no way of discerning whether or not the
person who owned the signature could write more than his name.

Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
People who might only have been able to sign their names might not
have been able to read at all. They could have been taught to sign
their name at home (doubtful in Shakespeare's case) or by someone they
knew who was at least somewhat literate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah yes, the monument...it's a grand piece of work over which scholars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arguing for some time. I don't think I need reproduce the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arguments here. I'm sure you've seen them a hundred times.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, scholars have not been arguing. Nutcases have been making
&gt;&gt;&gt; contra-factual assertions, which is not the same thing.

&gt;&gt; Many of the nutcases hold bona fide positions as English professors in
&gt;&gt; universities, but your point is taken that not all English professors
&gt;&gt; of whatever stripe are sane.

&gt;&quot;Many&quot;? Most of the academic Oxfordians of whom I'm aware hold
&gt; positions in some other field (linguistics, drama, etc.) and have few,
&gt; if any, qualifications as Elizabethan literary historians. Prof. Dr.
&gt; Daniel Wright is scarcely &quot;many.&quot; Whom, besides Wright, did you have in
&gt; mind by &quot;many&quot;?

"/>

From our organization alone:

Dr. Roger Stritmatter
Dr. Ren Draya
Drs. Popova and Brame (I think. Although I don't subscribe to their
theory that Oxford wrote almost everything)
Dr. Sarah Smith (ex-professor of English)
Dr. Michael Delahoyde
Several of Dr. Dan Wright's fellow professors

I expect I've missed some. That was just a quick count.

You should also know there are others who attend our conferences or
are members but take care not to let their departments know that they
are Oxfordians. Sorry, but that's the truth. You have to understand
that the way things are, it can be academic death to admit one is an
Oxfordian in certain English departments. That's why you see so many
Oxfordians from other academic departments. They tend to be freer. You
don't find professors of linguistics or drama knowledgeable in the
field? I can't imagine anyone more knowledgeable than someone who is a
drama expert, for example.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not

&gt;&gt;&gt; He was the mayor's son, and the school was free.

&gt;&gt; Excellent argument. I'm only sorry I didn't see it before. Of course
&gt;&gt; you must be right. Anyone who was an alderman's son and had access to
&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it. Just as
&gt;&gt; anyone who is the son of a professional now and gets a scholarship
&gt;&gt; must of necessity go to university. There can be no exceptions. You

&gt; I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and there was nothing special or remarkable about William
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. But I tend to doubt it.

&gt;&gt; You'll have to argue with someone else about that. I suspect it was his
&gt;&gt; special talent that made him remarkable enough to be read and enjoyed and
&gt;&gt; argued about almost 400 years after his death. And I don't believe there is
&gt;&gt; any explanation for genius, rational or otherwise. Hard work can only get
&gt;&gt; you so far.

&gt;&gt; TR

&gt; I believe I agreed with everything you said in your post till this
&gt; final paragraph, Tom. No explanation for genius? How about for
&gt; seven-footers? I think Shakespeare simply had the right genes for
&gt; what he did, and had them at just about the best possible combination
&gt; of time and place to have them. The genes gave him high general
&gt; intelligence, effective imagination, superior &quot;antroceptual&quot; (or
&gt; self-and-people-centered) intelligence, very superior verbal
&gt; intelligence, and the capacity to do hard work. The place and time
&gt; gave him a young, very healthy language to work with and contribute
&gt; to, a young theatre scene that had already drawn some of the best
&gt; minds in his country to it, and a young country just breaking into
&gt; world-importance and wealth. To mention the mainest factors.

"/>

The problem is, Bob, that almost all of this is conjecture. I've seen
evidence that whoever wrote the canon needed to speak Greek (a very
good paper presented in Portland two years ago) as there's evidence in
one of the plays that the language comes from the original Greek and
was not available in any English translation. If you need more on
this, I'll rattle my brains till the info falls out. Shakespeare also
needed to speak the old (Norman?) legal French (University of Miami
Law Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The author is Thomas
Regnier. I suggest everyone, Strat and anti-Strat alike, read his
pamphlet, for fascinating discussion of some of the more obscure legal
issues in the plays.

However brilliant you are, your genes won't teach you Greek and legal
French. Your jeans might, possibly, if they have lots of pockets with
lots of books in them.

Have never heard the word antroceptual before. Thank you.

Best wishes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Non sequiturs can be amusing, but they are seldom very persuasive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grounds on which to base a complex argument.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely not. I was attempting humour to leaven Mr. Kennedy's
&gt;&gt;&gt; nastiness. Are you suggesting he was using complex argument?
&gt;&gt; No; I am suggesting rather that John is correct in noting that some
&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians attempt to make complex arguments based almost
&gt;&gt; entirely upon non sequiturs. Have you ever read some of Stephanie
&gt;&gt; Caruana's most memorable threads? Indeed, non sequiturs were second
&gt;&gt; only to errors in Stephanie's arguments -- for a sample of the latter,
&gt;&gt; see the factoids Stephanie posted during her notorious Reign of Error
&gt;&gt; (now remembered only by the connoisseurs of comedy, Stephanie's
&gt;&gt; contribution to the genre having been effortlessly eclipsed by
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's _ouevre_).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you're the first person ever to call
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me a snob.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I cannot see that John Kennedy called you a snob. Rather, he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referred collectively to &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; SOME of whom indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt -- not very persuasively -- to use non sequiturs, while others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resort to arguments based upon snob appeal. There are no h.l.a.s.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians whom I would actually label as liars (true, &quot;Dr.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Faker did claim to have a Ph.D., a claim which proved to be fraudulent,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but that claim was utterly pathetic in its desperation and in any case
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was completely irrelevant to the argument concerning authorship, so I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding it), as I suspect that most anti-Stratfordians ACTUALLY
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tactics of &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; it does not follow that he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to you specifically.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He said &quot;shakespeare-deniers&quot; and went on to generalise about them.
&gt;&gt; He did not use a universal quantifier. Rather, he noted that, as a
&gt;&gt; group, &quot;Shakespeare deniers&quot; reach various specious conclusions by means
&gt;&gt; of a variety of faulty modes of inference, including non sequiturs,
&gt;&gt; snobbery, and lying. While I tend to disagree about the supposed lying,
&gt;&gt; I note that even if I agreed, John's statement STILL need not mean that
&gt;&gt; EVERY anti-Stratfordian uses EACH of the modes of inference that John
&gt;&gt; enumerated; rather, SOME anti-Stratfordians use non sequiturs, while
&gt;&gt; OTHERS favor snobbery, etc.
&gt; Oy. I can't imagine why you're defending him, David.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are different.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But some anti-Stratfordians apparently are NOT particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in Shakespeare. Indeed, when Mr. Streitz soberly informed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that only one of Shakespeare's plays was set in a foreign country other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than Italy, someone asked (rhetorically) whether he had actually read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the plays. Mr. Streitz's reply was that he had read about half of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means other than by reading the works.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't find Mr. Streitz particularly representative of Oxfordians
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians may well thank whatever gods there be for that!
&gt;&gt;&gt; though you have several times used him as an example.
&gt;&gt; While I agree that Mr. Streitz is not &quot;representative,&quot; neither is he
&gt;&gt; particularly anomalous -- for an Oxfordian. One need only peruse the
&gt;&gt; many rather amusing Oxfordian web sites or survey the print literature
&gt;&gt; to confirm this assessment. (Indeed, I doubt that the concept of
&gt;&gt;&quot;representative Oxfordian&quot; is at all meaningful. While one may choose
&gt;&gt; to represent a distribution by its mean, when the standard deviation is
&gt;&gt; excessively large, such a representation is not very meaningful.)
&gt; Mr. Streitz is anomalous, and of course you know that,

Are you familiar with the activities of Percy Allen? See, e.g.,

&lt;
critura_automatica.html&gt;.

While Mr. Streitz may draw unwarranted inferences (e.g., that the Folger
trustees KNOW that their portrait of Hugh Hammersley is really Oxford
because they refused to sell the canvas to Mr. Streitz), but as far as I
know Mr. Streitz has not thus far consulted a medium in his historical
&quot;research.&quot; We have already discussed Raeto West, whose now defunct web
page contained material that made Mr. Streitz look like a mere amateur
crank. We have also discussed Lord Burford, who is surely at least as
anomalous as Mr. Streitz. Have you read _Shakespeare and the Tudor
Rose_ by Elisabeth Sears? Have you read any of Art Neuendorffer's posts
(e.g., the one in which he triumphantly adduces the supposed anagram &quot;I
kill Edwasd de Vese&quot;? Have you seen

&lt;&gt;?

For that matter, have you read _This Star of England_? While Mr.
Streitz may not be &quot;representative,&quot; to the extent that such a locution
makes sense, he is certainly not particularly anomalous, at least for an
Oxfordian. His opinions on the etiology of AIDS or on the Bernoulli
Principle are no more eccentric than Mr. Crowley's &quot;aquatic ape&quot; beliefs
or Stephanie Caruana's &quot;Gemstone&quot; conspiracy theory.

&gt; evidence that whoever wrote the canon needed to speak Greek (a very
&gt; good paper presented in Portland two years ago) as there's evidence in
&gt; one of the plays that the language comes from the original Greek and
&gt; was not available in any English translation. If you need more on
&gt; this, I'll rattle my brains till the info falls out. Shakespeare also
&gt; needed to speak the old (Norman?) legal French (University of Miami
&gt; Law Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The author is Thomas
&gt; Regnier. I suggest everyone, Strat and anti-Strat alike, read his
&gt; pamphlet, for fascinating discussion of some of the more obscure legal
&gt; issues in the plays.

&gt; However brilliant you are, your genes won't teach you Greek and legal
&gt; French. Your jeans might, possibly, if they have lots of pockets with
&gt; lots of books in them.

&gt;Well. Finally we have something that resembles a substantive point, as thin
&gt;as it is. At least it is not a generic call to politeness.

&gt;&gt; Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
&gt;&gt; People who might only have been able to sign their names might not
&gt;&gt; have been able to read at all. They could have been taught to sign
&gt;&gt; their name at home (doubtful in Shakespeare's case) or by someone they
&gt;&gt; knew who was at least somewhat literate.

&gt;Hmmm.

&gt;&quot;People who might&quot;
&gt;&quot;might not have been able to read&quot;
&gt;&quot;could have been taught&quot;

&gt;These are strange reactions from a person who, on another thread, says, &quot;I'm
&gt;also alarmed at the number of books on Shakespeare of Stratford that employ
&gt;the terms 'could have, should
&gt;have, would have.'&quot;

&gt;But it's no more or less than I expected. We've seen the same thing here for
&gt;years. Why should she be different?

"/>

They always seem to miss the fact that the conjectures that
Stratfordians make don't require the belief in a massive conspiracy
conducted over at least 20 years which no one ever revealed, not
even the enemies of Oxenforde. His enemies had no problem
accusing him of homosexual pederasty, but God forbid they
accuse him of writing Hamlet!

See my demolition of Monsarrat's RES paper!

Of course we have. We could have evidence that the person made money
in a vocation that required him to write, and/or we could have the

with Shakespeare (who wrote two words besides his name, by the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah yes, the monument...it's a grand piece of work over which scholars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been arguing for some time. I don't think I need reproduce the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arguments here. I'm sure you've seen them a hundred times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, scholars have not been arguing. Nutcases have been making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contra-factual assertions, which is not the same thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the nutcases hold bona fide positions as English professors in
&gt;&gt;&gt; universities, but your point is taken that not all English professors
&gt;&gt;&gt; of whatever stripe are sane.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Many&quot;? Most of the academic Oxfordians of whom I'm aware hold
&gt;&gt; positions in some other field (linguistics, drama, etc.) and have few,
&gt;&gt; if any, qualifications as Elizabethan literary historians. Prof. Dr.
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wright is scarcely &quot;many.&quot; Whom, besides Wright, did you have in
&gt;&gt; mind by &quot;many&quot;?

&gt; From our organization alone:

&gt; Dr. Roger Stritmatter
&gt; Dr. Ren Draya
&gt; Drs. Popova and Brame (I think. Although I don't subscribe to their
&gt; theory that Oxford wrote almost everything)
&gt; Dr. Sarah Smith (ex-professor of English)
&gt; Dr. Michael Delahoyde
&gt; Several of Dr. Dan Wright's fellow professors

&gt; I expect I've missed some. That was just a quick count.

&gt; You should also know there are others who attend our conferences or
&gt; are members but take care not to let their departments know that they
&gt; are Oxfordians. Sorry, but that's the truth. You have to understand
&gt; that the way things are, it can be academic death to admit one is an
&gt; Oxfordian in certain English departments. That's why you see so many
&gt; Oxfordians from other academic departments. They tend to be freer. You
&gt; don't find professors of linguistics or drama knowledgeable in the
&gt; field? I can't imagine anyone more knowledgeable than someone who is a
&gt; drama expert, for example.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attend grammar school.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was the mayor's son, and the school was free.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Excellent argument. I'm only sorry I didn't see it before. Of course
&gt;&gt;&gt; you must be right. Anyone who was an alderman's son and had access to
&gt;&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it. Just as
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone who is the son of a professional now and gets a scholarship
&gt;&gt;&gt; must of necessity go to university. There can be no exceptions. You
&gt;&gt;&gt; might explain that to my son. He plays the guitar in the subway.

&gt;&gt; I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.
&gt;&gt; Rather, the natural implication of what John said is that it is
&gt;&gt; REASONABLE to conjecture that Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar
&gt;&gt; school, in view of his documented profession, in view of the copious
&gt;&gt; evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the existence of a
&gt;&gt; letter written to him.

&gt; Here you go defending John again. He did a rather good job of it
&gt; himself. And if you don't think that &quot;Rather, the natural implication

&gt; must disagree on what a circular argument is.

&gt; One letter? Did I actually see that? One letter that to my knowledge
&gt; was never delivered?

Right, LynnE--the writer of the letter, a lifelong neighbor of
Shakespeare's who somehow learned how to write, suddenly realized that
Shakespeare was illiterate and decided not to send the letter to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the fact that we _know_ that Shakespeare was an actor, a poet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a playwright, yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare must be the author of the canon because he knew how to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good grief! I've never seen *anyone* argue that Shakespeare must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; the author of the canon because he knew how to read! I cannot even
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine the utterance of which the above is supposed to be a paraphrase,
&gt;&gt;&gt; nor can I find any likely candidate in John's post.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare is regarded by experts in literary history as the author
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the works attributed to him because there is copious evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; various sorts for that attribution, NOT because anyone explicitly said
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt;&gt;&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
&gt;&gt;&gt; putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been) spoke Greek fluently, although there is no documentary evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he was raised in a Greek-speaking milieu, that he attended the
&gt;&gt;&gt; local grammar school, etc.

&gt;&gt; Please name the experts in literary history (as opposed to English
&gt;&gt; professors, etc.)you are referring to.

&gt; You could start with E.K. Chambers, whose two-volume compilation of
&gt; the documentary evidence and pertinent commentary is pretty complete.

I read that ages ago. I was actually at the university next door to
his. Something more recent, perhaps?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We know he knew how to read because he was the author of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; canon. Well done.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you'll reread John's post, I think you'll agree that the above is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not remotely what he said. In particular, John did not attempt to infer
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's authorship of the canon from his supposed literacy.

&gt;&gt; I was being ironic. Good grief, Charlie Brown? Ever heard of that? But
&gt;&gt; the Will Shakespeare argument does tend to be circular.

&gt; There is NOTHING circular about what John wrote, because John did NOT
&gt; attempt to deduce Shakespeare's authorship of the canon from his
&gt; literacy. That was your contribution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you. You may not have noticed that the tendency on hlas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has been to attempt to be polite, use reasoned argument,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been called a sexist, a racist, and various other unflattering
&gt;&gt;&gt; epithets recently, and I am certainly not alone. Nor have I noticed
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the politeness of Mr. Crowley's surly, sour-grapes rants has much
&gt;&gt;&gt; improved -- indeed, you must have noticed yourself that Mr. Crowley
&gt;&gt;&gt; tends to credit anyone who does not share his perception (that the early
&gt;&gt;&gt; sonnets are addressed to the Queen, and that one of the later ones
&gt;&gt;&gt; immortalizes a defecation competition between Oxford and the Queen) with
&gt;&gt;&gt; roughly the intelligence of an annelid. Thus I'm not at all certain
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I can detect the supposed trend to which you allude.

&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps I should say that in the main people here are more
&gt;&gt; polite to me--with the exception of Paul, of course.

&gt; Don't take it personally, Lynne. Mr. Crowley has been displaying his
&gt; *barnacle's brain, wrapped in a pit bull's hide* to all and sundry for
&gt; years.

&gt;&gt; Some have even
&gt;&gt; (almost) realised that I'm a human being. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Shakespeare deniers do not use reasoned argument. They use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; snobbery, non-sequiturs, and outright lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We're not in the least Shakespeare deniers. We just believe in an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternative Shakespeare. By the way, I'm known for my non-sequiturs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they drive my husband crazy,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Non sequiturs can be amusing, but they are seldom very persuasive
&gt;&gt;&gt; grounds on which to base a complex argument.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely not. I was attempting humour to leaven Mr. Kennedy's
&gt;&gt; nastiness. Are you suggesting he was using complex argument?

&gt; No; I am suggesting rather that John is correct in noting that some
&gt; anti-Stratfordians attempt to make complex arguments based almost
&gt; entirely upon non sequiturs. Have you ever read some of Stephanie
&gt; Caruana's most memorable threads? Indeed, non sequiturs were second
&gt; only to errors in Stephanie's arguments -- for a sample of the latter,
&gt; see the factoids Stephanie posted during her notorious Reign of Error
&gt; (now remembered only by the connoisseurs of comedy, Stephanie's
&gt; contribution to the genre having been effortlessly eclipsed by
&gt; Elizabeth's _ouevre_).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you're the first person ever to call
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me a snob.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I cannot see that John Kennedy called you a snob. Rather, he
&gt;&gt;&gt; referred collectively to &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; SOME of whom indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt -- not very persuasively -- to use non sequiturs, while others
&gt;&gt;&gt; resort to arguments based upon snob appeal. There are no h.l.a.s.
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians whom I would actually label as liars (true, &quot;Dr.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Faker did claim to have a Ph.D., a claim which proved to be fraudulent,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but that claim was utterly pathetic in its desperation and in any case
&gt;&gt;&gt; was completely irrelevant to the argument concerning authorship, so I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding it), as I suspect that most anti-Stratfordians ACTUALLY
&gt;&gt;&gt; BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the
&gt;&gt;&gt; tactics of &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; it does not follow that he is
&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to you specifically.

&gt;&gt; He said &quot;shakespeare-deniers&quot; and went on to generalise about them.

&gt; He did not use a universal quantifier. Rather, he noted that, as a
&gt; group, &quot;Shakespeare deniers&quot; reach various specious conclusions by means
&gt; of a variety of faulty modes of inference, including non sequiturs,
&gt; snobbery, and lying. While I tend to disagree about the supposed lying,
&gt; I note that even if I agreed, John's statement STILL need not mean that
&gt; EVERY anti-Stratfordian uses EACH of the modes of inference that John
&gt; enumerated; rather, SOME anti-Stratfordians use non sequiturs, while
&gt; OTHERS favor snobbery, etc.

&gt;&gt; lies.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; But some anti-Stratfordians apparently are NOT particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in Shakespeare. Indeed, when Mr. Streitz soberly informed us

&gt;&gt;&gt; he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
&gt;&gt;&gt; author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
&gt;&gt;&gt; means other than by reading the works.

&gt;&gt; I don't find Mr. Streitz particularly representative of Oxfordians

&gt; Oxfordians may well thank whatever gods there be for that!

No, I used a description, not a name.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I come by my doubts honestly.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not because there's some secret joy in contrarianism or because it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; an easy topic to bicker over, but because the Life is incongruous with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Works.

&gt;&gt; That sums it up. Your belief system is based on a mere opinion that
&gt;&gt; reduces to your not liking Shakespeare of Stratford.

&gt; That's a silly inference. I dislike Shakspere as a person because I
&gt; cannot match the facts of his life to the works credited to him? It
&gt; could well be that the historical Shakspere is a guy worth knowing, if
&gt; only for his con artistry.

&gt;&gt; That doesn't
&gt;&gt; make it irrational.

&gt; As you conceive, it DOES.

&gt;&gt; What makes it irrational is that, for you, this
&gt;&gt; intuition of yours is sufficient to outweigh a huge amount of hard
&gt;&gt; evidence that your belief system is wrong PLUS the preposterously
&gt;&gt; tangled conspiracy theory that your belief system must force you to
&gt;&gt; accept in spite of there being NO direct or even anecdotal evidence of
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt; Then you don't get anything. Why am I not allowed to think of
&gt; Shakspere as a front for a small group of ghostwriters who, to this
&gt; very day, have not been affirmatively identified? I concede that
&gt; Shakspere was an actor and a sharer who, by virtue of that very
&gt; proximity, was well-placed to be considered (ALBEIT WRONGLY) the
&gt; playwright-poet Shakespeare. He is a &quot;fellow&quot; to a lot of actors and
&gt; sharers, but not so much a fellow to Jonson until we've passed the
&gt; point of contradiction.

"/>

You're allowed to think anything you want to, but you cannot expect to
be taken as having a rational belief system if what you think has no
hard evidence to support it and it contradicted by all the hard
evidence so far discovered, and, on top of it, requires in incredibly
tortuous conspriacy theory, also unsupported by any hard facts, at
all, or even anecdotal evidence.

&gt;&gt; If Oxford had lived till 1616 and Shakespeare had died in 1604, then

You made the ame mistake as LynnE: my point is that since we have hard
evidence(Heywood and the writer of the preface to Troilus and

Stratford man had died in 1604, you would have hard evidence against
him--and for Oxford, if he had lived until 1616.

This is from a US Supreme Court case, McIntryre v. Ohio
Elections Commission. Something about a Mrs. McIntyre
who distributed anonymous leaflets which violated Ohio State
laws that political material must be signed. The lawyer, who
nicely annotated his writ, is apparently an Oxfordian:

4 American names such as Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne
Clemens) and O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) come
readily to mind. Benjamin Franklin employed numerous
different pseudonyms. See 2 W. C. Bruce, Benjamin
Franklin Self Revealed: A Biographical and Critical
Study Based Mainly on His Own Writings, ch. 5 (2d ed.
1923). Distinguished French authors such as Voltaire
(Francois Marie Arouet) and George Sand (Amandine Aurore
Lucie Dupin), and British authors such as George Eliot
(Mary Ann Evans), Charles Lamb (sometimes wrote as
&quot;Elia&quot;), and Charles Dickens (sometimes wrote as &quot;Boz&quot;)
, also published under assumed names. Indeed, some
believe the works of Shakespeare were actually written
by the Earl of Oxford rather than by William Shaksper of
Stratford on Avon. See C. Ogburn, The Mysterious William
Shakespeare: The Myth &amp; the Reality (2d ed. 1992); but
see S. Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives (2d ed. 1991)
(adhering to the traditional view that Shaksper was in
fact the author). See also Stevens, The Shakespeare
Canon of Statutory Construction, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1373
(1992) (commenting on the competing theories).

5 Though such a requirement might provide assistance to
critics in evaluating the quality and significance of
the writing, it is not indispensable. To draw an analogy
from a nonliterary context, the now pervasive practice
of grading law school examination papers &quot;blindly&quot;
(i.e., under a system in which the professor does not
know whose paper she is grading) indicates that such
evaluations are possible--indeed, perhaps more reliable-
-when any bias associated with the author's identity is
prescinded.

6 That tradition is most famously embodied in the
Federalist Papers, authored by James Madison, Alexander
Hamilton, and John Jay, but signed &quot;Publius.&quot; Publius's
opponents, the Anti Federalists, also tended to publish
under pseudonyms: prominent among them were &quot;Cato,&quot;
believed to be New York Governor George Clinton;
&quot;Centinel,&quot; probably Samuel Bryan or his father,
Pennsylvania judge and legislator George Bryan; &quot;The
Federal Farmer,&quot; who may have been Richard Henry Lee, a
Virginia member of the Continental Congress and a signer
of the Declaration of Independence; and &quot;Brutus,&quot; who
may have been Robert Yates, a New York Supreme Court
justice who walked out on the Constitutional Convention.
2 H. Storing, ed., The Complete Anti Federalist (1981).
A forerunner of all of these writers was the pre-
Revolutionary War English pamphleteer &quot;Junius,&quot; whose

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare is regarded by experts in literary history as the author

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he knew how to read. However, in view of the abundant evidence of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various kinds for his authorship of the poetry and plays attributed to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him, it is certainly a reasonable inference that he knew how to read.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One certainly need not document the means whereby he attained this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; putative proficiency in order for the inference to be reasonable. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; likewise a plausible inference that Homer (whoever he or she may have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been) spoke Greek fluently, although there is no documentary evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he was raised in a Greek-speaking milieu, that he attended the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local grammar school, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please name the experts in literary history (as opposed to English
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professors, etc.)you are referring to.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You could start with E.K. Chambers, whose two-volume compilation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the documentary evidence and pertinent commentary is pretty complete.

&gt;&gt; I read that ages ago. I was actually at the university next door to
&gt;&gt; his. Something more recent, perhaps?

&gt; Why? Chambers is still an invaluable reference, and quite sufficient
&gt; to demolish many anti-Stratfordian fantasies.

I'm very tired, David, and something awful has happened here. One of
my husband's students, a little girl of nine, has been abducted by a
stranger. But I'll do my best. All I'm saying is that so much new
material has turned up since 1930 or whenever, that we can't be
certain he'd still make the same observations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Non sequiturs can be amusing, but they are seldom very persuasive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grounds on which to base a complex argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely not. I was attempting humour to leaven Mr. Kennedy's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nastiness. Are you suggesting he was using complex argument?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No; I am suggesting rather that John is correct in noting that some
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians attempt to make complex arguments based almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely upon non sequiturs. Have you ever read some of Stephanie
&gt;&gt;&gt; Caruana's most memorable threads? Indeed, non sequiturs were second
&gt;&gt;&gt; only to errors in Stephanie's arguments -- for a sample of the latter,
&gt;&gt;&gt; see the factoids Stephanie posted during her notorious Reign of Error
&gt;&gt;&gt; (now remembered only by the connoisseurs of comedy, Stephanie's
&gt;&gt;&gt; contribution to the genre having been effortlessly eclipsed by
&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's _ouevre_).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you're the first person ever to call
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me a snob.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I cannot see that John Kennedy called you a snob. Rather, he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referred collectively to &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; SOME of whom indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt -- not very persuasively -- to use non sequiturs, while others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resort to arguments based upon snob appeal. There are no h.l.a.s.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordians whom I would actually label as liars (true, &quot;Dr.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Faker did claim to have a Ph.D., a claim which proved to be fraudulent,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but that claim was utterly pathetic in its desperation and in any case
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was completely irrelevant to the argument concerning authorship, so I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disregarding it), as I suspect that most anti-Stratfordians ACTUALLY
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BELIEVE the nonsense they post (even risible rubbish like Caxton as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, like Mr. Streitz's assurance that only one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.); however, even if John Kennedy includes prevarication among the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tactics of &quot;Shakespeare deniers,&quot; it does not follow that he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referring to you specifically.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He said &quot;shakespeare-deniers&quot; and went on to generalise about them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He did not use a universal quantifier. Rather, he noted that, as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; group, &quot;Shakespeare deniers&quot; reach various specious conclusions by means
&gt;&gt;&gt; of a variety of faulty modes of inference, including non sequiturs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; snobbery, and lying. While I tend to disagree about the supposed lying,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I note that even if I agreed, John's statement STILL need not mean that
&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERY anti-Stratfordian uses EACH of the modes of inference that John
&gt;&gt;&gt; enumerated; rather, SOME anti-Stratfordians use non sequiturs, while
&gt;&gt;&gt; OTHERS favor snobbery, etc.

&gt;&gt; Oy. I can't imagine why you're defending him, David.

&gt; I am not defending what he wrote; indeed, I took issue with part of
&gt; it above. Rather, I am simply noting that I believe that you misread
&gt; what he said.

&gt;&gt; Let him

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot help but believe he was including me. He did not say, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, &quot;Shakespeare deniers (except for you, Lynne) do not use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasoned argument. They use snobbery, non-sequiturs, and outright
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lies.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor did he say that you employ all three. He may have had in mind
&gt;&gt;&gt; your non sequiturs, Mr. Crowley's class snobbery, and &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker's
&gt;&gt;&gt; proven fraud.

&gt;&gt; Like you, I don't use non-sequiturs to further an argument. Nor do
&gt;&gt; three antistratfordians (or two, if you omit me) a case maketh.

&gt; Oh, there are many more. For example, Stephanie Caruana and
&gt; Elizabeth Weird are superb at non sequiturs, and Mr. Crowley scarcely
&gt; has exclusive rights to the class snobbery angle.

How sad that we must keep dragging out the same people. It seems to me

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so much, because there are so few of us genuinely interested in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare and the Elizabethan era and we are much more alike than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are different.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But some anti-Stratfordians apparently are NOT particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in Shakespeare. Indeed, when Mr. Streitz soberly informed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that only one of Shakespeare's plays was set in a foreign country other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than Italy, someone asked (rhetorically) whether he had actually read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the plays. Mr. Streitz's reply was that he had read about half of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he then opined that he was more interested in the biography of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; author, whose identity he was evidently quite prepated to divine by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means other than by reading the works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't find Mr. Streitz particularly representative of Oxfordians

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordians may well thank whatever gods there be for that!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though you have several times used him as an example.

&gt;&gt;&gt; While I agree that Mr. Streitz is not &quot;representative,&quot; neither is he
&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly anomalous -- for an Oxfordian. One need only peruse the
&gt;&gt;&gt; many rather amusing Oxfordian web sites or survey the print literature
&gt;&gt;&gt; to confirm this assessment. (Indeed, I doubt that the concept of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;representative Oxfordian&quot; is at all meaningful. While one may choose
&gt;&gt;&gt; to represent a distribution by its mean, when the standard deviation is
&gt;&gt;&gt; excessively large, such a representation is not very meaningful.)

I'm an Oxfordian. Visit my website.   Tell me
what's weird about it. Let us go case by case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Mr. Streitz is anomalous, and of course you know that,

&gt;&lt;http://mundoparanormal.iespana.es/mundoparanormal/docs/parapsicologia/es
&gt; critura_automatica.html&gt;.

&gt; While Mr. Streitz may draw unwarranted inferences (e.g., that the Folger
&gt; trustees KNOW that their portrait of Hugh Hammersley is really Oxford
&gt; because they refused to sell the canvas to Mr. Streitz), but as far as I
&gt; know Mr. Streitz has not thus far consulted a medium in his historical
&gt;&quot;research.&quot; We have already discussed Raeto West, whose now defunct web
&gt; page contained material that made Mr. Streitz look like a mere amateur
&gt; crank. We have also discussed Lord Burford, who is surely at least as
&gt; anomalous as Mr. Streitz. Have you read _Shakespeare and the Tudor
&gt; Rose_ by Elisabeth Sears? Have you read any of Art Neuendorffer's posts
&gt; (e.g., the one in which he triumphantly adduces the supposed anagram &quot;I
&gt; kill Edwasd de Vese&quot;? Have you seen

&gt;&lt;http://www.pe.net/%7Ewebrebel/Anagrams2.html&gt;?

&gt; For that matter, have you read _This Star of England_? While Mr.
&gt; Streitz may not be &quot;representative,&quot; to the extent that such a locution
&gt; makes sense, he is certainly not particularly anomalous, at least for an

It's irrelevant to the fact that some people may have learned to write

I have no idea. I believe it's one of the things we can't know. And
that's why we can't theorise that Shakespeare of Stratford was a good
reader or writer. I happen to believe he could probably read as he was
an actor. But that's conjecture on my part.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather, the natural implication of what John said is that it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; REASONABLE to conjecture that Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar
&gt;&gt;&gt; school, in view of his documented profession, in view of the copious
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the existence of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter written to him.

&gt;&gt; Here you go defending John again. He did a rather good job of it
&gt;&gt; himself. And if you don't think that &quot;Rather, the natural implication
&gt;&gt; of what John said is that it is REASONABLE to conjecture that
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar school...in view of the
&gt;&gt; copious evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the
&gt;&gt; existence of a letter written to him&quot; is a circular argument, then we
&gt;&gt; must disagree on what a circular argument is.

&gt; Premises:

&gt; Evidence of literary activity.
&gt; Existence of a letter written to him.

&gt; Conclusion:

&gt; Probably attended the grammar school.

&gt; For it to be circular, the premises would
&gt; have to depend upon the conclusion. Do you
&gt; think that the &quot;Evidence of literary activity&quot;
&gt; depends upon the idea that he &quot;probably
&gt; attended the grammar school&quot;? It doesn't.
&gt; (Each of the bits of evidence that show us
&gt; that Shakespeare of Stratford was active
&gt; in a literary sense is logically independent
&gt; of where (or if) he went to school.)

"/>

You guys are saying he probably attended grammar school because of his
literary activity, but the premise of his literary activity, rests,
among other factors, on his having attended grammar school. It's you
Stratfordians who keep saying that, not I. His probable attendance at
school figures large in almost all the standard biogs, and that's
because if he hadn't gone to school and learned to read and write, he
couldn't be the author of the canon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One letter? Did I actually see that? One letter that to my knowledge
&gt;&gt; was never delivered?

&gt; Do you really think that non-delivery is relevant?

"/>

Of course. The author of the letter suddenly remembered that
Shakespeare couldn't read, and so visited him instead. ;)

Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You'll have to argue with someone else about that. I suspect it was

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe I agreed with everything you said in your post till this
&gt;&gt;&gt; final paragraph, Tom. No explanation for genius? How about for
&gt;&gt;&gt; seven-footers? I think Shakespeare simply had the right genes for
&gt;&gt;&gt; what he did, and had them at just about the best possible combination
&gt;&gt;&gt; of time and place to have them. The genes gave him high general
&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligence, effective imagination, superior &quot;antroceptual&quot; (or
&gt;&gt;&gt; self-and-people-centered) intelligence, very superior verbal
&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligence, and the capacity to do hard work. The place and time
&gt;&gt;&gt; gave him a young, very healthy language to work with and contribute
&gt;&gt;&gt; to, a young theatre scene that had already drawn some of the best
&gt;&gt;&gt; minds in his country to it, and a young country just breaking into
&gt;&gt;&gt; world-importance and wealth. To mention the mainest factors.

&gt; I've seen
&gt;&gt; evidence that whoever wrote the canon needed to speak Greek (a very
&gt;&gt; good paper presented in Portland two years ago) as there's evidence in
&gt;&gt; one of the plays that the language comes from the original Greek and
&gt;&gt; was not available in any English translation. If you need more on
&gt;&gt; this, I'll rattle my brains till the info falls out. Shakespeare also
&gt;&gt; needed to speak the old (Norman?) legal French (University of Miami
&gt;&gt; Law Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The author is Thomas
&gt;&gt; Regnier. I suggest everyone, Strat and anti-Strat alike, read his
&gt;&gt; pamphlet, for fascinating discussion of some of the more obscure legal
&gt;&gt; issues in the plays.

&gt;&gt; However brilliant you are, your genes won't teach you Greek and legal

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contra-factual assertions, which is not the same thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the nutcases hold bona fide positions as English professors in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; universities, but your point is taken that not all English professors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of whatever stripe are sane.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Many&quot;? Most of the academic Oxfordians of whom I'm aware hold
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions in some other field (linguistics, drama, etc.) and have few,
&gt;&gt;&gt; if any, qualifications as Elizabethan literary historians. Prof. Dr.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Daniel Wright is scarcely &quot;many.&quot; Whom, besides Wright, did you have in
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind by &quot;many&quot;?

&gt;&gt; From our organization alone:

&gt;&gt; Dr. Roger Stritmatter
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ren Draya
&gt;&gt; Drs. Popova and Brame (I think. Although I don't subscribe to their
&gt;&gt; theory that Oxford wrote almost everything)
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Smith (ex-professor of English)
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Delahoyde
&gt;&gt; Several of Dr. Dan Wright's fellow professors

&gt;&gt; I expect I've missed some. That was just a quick count.

&gt;&gt; You should also know there are others who attend our conferences or
&gt;&gt; are members but take care not to let their departments know that they
&gt;&gt; are Oxfordians. Sorry, but that's the truth. You have to understand
&gt;&gt; that the way things are, it can be academic death to admit one is an
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian in certain English departments. That's why you see so many
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians from other academic departments. They tend to be freer. You
&gt;&gt; don't find professors of linguistics or drama knowledgeable in the
&gt;&gt; field? I can't imagine anyone more knowledgeable than someone who is a
&gt;&gt; drama expert, for example.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attend grammar school.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was the mayor's son, and the school was free.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Excellent argument. I'm only sorry I didn't see it before. Of course
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you must be right. Anyone who was an alderman's son and had access to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a free education must of necessity have taken advantage of it. Just as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone who is the son of a professional now and gets a scholarship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must of necessity go to university. There can be no exceptions. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might explain that to my son. He plays the guitar in the subway.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather, the natural implication of what John said is that it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; REASONABLE to conjecture that Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar
&gt;&gt;&gt; school, in view of his documented profession, in view of the copious
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the existence of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter written to him.

&gt;&gt; Here you go defending John again. He did a rather good job of it
&gt;&gt; himself. And if you don't think that &quot;Rather, the natural implication
&gt;&gt; of what John said is that it is REASONABLE to conjecture that
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar school...in view of the
&gt;&gt; copious evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the
&gt;&gt; existence of a letter written to him&quot; is a circular argument, then we
&gt;&gt; must disagree on what a circular argument is.

&gt;&gt; One letter? Did I actually see that? One letter that to my knowledge
&gt;&gt; was never delivered?

&gt; Right, LynnE--the writer of the letter, a lifelong neighbor of
&gt; Shakespeare's who somehow learned how to write, suddenly realized that
&gt; Shakespeare was illiterate and decided not to send the letter to him.

SNIP

I think the examples listed demonstrate an important
point, Elizabeth.

Any piece of evidence can be negated or invalidated
by some other piece of evidence.

As I've repeatedly said, I think the name 'William
Shakespeare' on the title page of a work, by itself, is
evidence that someone named William Shakespeare wrote the
work.

In response, you can say, and apparently are saying,
&quot;What about the case of Mark Twain?&quot;, an oft-used argument
in this group.

To which I would answer, the name Mark Twain on the
title page of a book (say &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;), **by itself**, is
evidence that the book was written by someone named Mark
Twain.

As it happens, however, this piece of evidence, in
this particular instance, is negated or invalidated by other
pieces of evidence. Now I have to admit that while I 'know'
that 'Mark Twain' was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens, I'm
uncertain what specific documents exist that tell us this.
But I'm quite certain that such documents exist, whether
they be legal documents, or written notes from Clemens or
his publishers, or whatever. I will also go out on a limb
and say (without knowing for certain) that similar
documentary evidence exists for the other authors mentioned
in the above snipped passage of your quote. If I'm wrong,
I'm sure you'll tell me.

If so, then in those *specific* cases the evidence
of the name on the title page has been negated or
invalidated by other pieces of evidence.

The problem for you in the case of Shakespeare, as
you well know, is that no similar documentary evidence
exists that negates or invalidates the name on the title
page. Therefore, the name 'William Shakespeare' on the
title page continues to stand as evidence that the work was
written by someone with the name William Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt; Steese:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with Anti-Stratfordianism:
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt; Reedy:

&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
logical
&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified.

&gt; That doesn't even make sense. Paranoid schizophrenia is the result of
&gt; organic imbalances in the brain. You think it's governed by some
&gt; belief system? Belief systems may be conceived and followed in the
&gt; schizophrenic mind with a great degree of rational consistency, but
&gt; not for long. Not when the context of the schizophrenic's life, as it
&gt; almost certainly would be, is known. For example, I once knew a man
&gt; who lived his whole life in campus coffeehouses, singing and playing
&gt; guitar, bumming cigarettes and change, stinking, being a goddamned
&gt; genius. His name was Keith. Keith explained how the U.S. Constitution
&gt; is a fine demonstration of Newtonian mechanics, with all its checks
&gt; and balances and proportionalism. Schizophrenic? I would guess so. And
&gt; I won't say it doesn't matter.

"/>

Your response has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.

Try this. Isolate a sentence you wrote, for example, &quot;You think it's
governed by some belief system?&quot; Then take a look at what I wrote and
isolate the part you think prompted your response. Compare the two and see
if you can spot the differences.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The problem, as with

&gt;&gt;&gt; It was because of such rational belief systems that

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely to
ever

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all, just sad.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, sure -- that's easier than defending your claims about paranoid
&gt;&gt;&gt; schizophrenia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The notion that a person making an observation on a topic is claiming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be an expert on that topic is what is remarkable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, you like dictionary definitions, so here's one for you, free of
&gt;&gt;&gt; charge:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;irony. 1. a. The use of words to express something different from and
&gt;&gt;&gt; often opposite to their literal meaning.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; You see, I didn't think you were claiming to be an expert at all! Now,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the funny part is that if an expert in paranoid schizophrenia had made
&gt;&gt;&gt; the flat statements of fact that you made, his or her expertise would
&gt;&gt;&gt; lend credence to what are, on their face, improbable assertions. When
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; professed non-expert (such as you) makes such statements, their
&gt;&gt;&gt; improbability suggests that said non-expert is mistaken.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By that standard, I guess you're an expert on the world, reality and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in it, judging from your last post.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm exactly as much of an expert on those subjects as you are on mental
&gt;&gt;&gt; illness, so I hope you will not take it much amiss if I find your
&gt;&gt;&gt; statements about schizophrenia as dismissible as you find my musings on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;the world, reality and everything in it.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I am by no means an expert on mental illness, but I know something about
it,
&gt;&gt; having worked with people who had varying degrees of mental illness for
more
&gt;&gt; than two decades. My statement stands; paranoid schizophrenia is
extremely
&gt;&gt; rational and logical -- or perhaps I should say it slavishly follows its
own
&gt;&gt; internal logic? -- once the underlying belief system has been
identified.

&gt;&gt; I'm not going to start a Web site war, but you might check out a few
such as

"/>

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 0092398.PDF, which states, among other things, &quot;It [paranoid
schizophrenia]
&gt;&gt; is a disorder of the belief system.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Or this one,  http://nzsf.supremesite.net/intro.html , which says, &quot;It has
its
&gt;&gt; own, internal logic, but a logic that resists all reason from the
outside.&quot;

&gt;&gt; This one,

"/>

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; .html , will sound familiar. &quot;Typically, in schizophrenia, delusions
tend to
&gt;&gt; be very bizarre and even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the
&gt;&gt; contrary, a person will not give up these beliefs . . . . Patients can
&gt;&gt; either be entirely incoherent to the point that we can't understand them
or,
&gt;&gt; more typically, patients may have subtle idiosyncratic logic which makes
&gt;&gt; their speech seem peculiar and illogical.&quot;

&gt;&gt; All of these were written by people with intimate knowledge of the
disease,
&gt;&gt; but only one is a &quot;recognized expert.&quot;

&gt; I'd guess it's this last one that is by the &quot;recognized expert&quot;? Fine,
but
&gt; this is not a monograph, but a talk addressed to what seems to be a fairly
&gt; general audience, followed by questions. The audience is not identified,
&gt; nor is the time or the occasion. I've learned that when an expert is
&gt; writing or speaking fairly casually, his words should not be interpreted
so
&gt; closely as they would be in a monograph he'd published in his own field.

&gt; Peter Kramer (who is a practicing psychiatrist), to the contrary of what
&gt; you've posted here, makes the point that schizophrenia is _not_ a disease
&gt; primarily characterized by its symptoms. Psychosis brought on by drug use
&gt; is never schizophrenia; psychosis brought on by a brain tumor is never
&gt; schizophrenia. If evidence is found (even after death, in the course of
an
&gt; autopsy) that either of these was true (drug use or a physical lesion such
&gt; as a tumor), the diagnosis of schizophrenia is rescinded. At the same
time,
&gt; schizophrenia is &quot;the worst&quot; disease most people know about, so it
attracts
&gt; non-scientists, who use it as a metaphor or who try to fit it into their
own
&gt; (non-medical) frames of reference.

&gt; If people (_whatever_ description they might fall under) would prefer to
&gt; have a term meaning, &quot;disorder of the belief system,&quot; they have an
&gt; obligation to write their own books, not to snipe at people who actually
did
&gt; write the books. They have an obligation to support their own profession,
&gt; not to hijack the professions of others. (My impression of you, so far,
&gt; Tom, is that you're not careful enough to distinguish between &quot;experts&quot;
who
&gt; are attempting to snipe at real experts, and the real experts, themselves.
&gt; I accept that you have worked in the field, but this is a question of
&gt; reading and quoting authorities, written sources.) If you or others here
&gt; wish to talk about this assumed &quot;disorder of the belief system,&quot; please do
&gt; not call it &quot;paranoid schizophrenia.&quot; If you wish to talk about those who
&gt; are attempting to hijack the term, or to defend them, you ought to be
&gt; prepared for criticism of them. (Again, if you can't tell the difference,
&gt; you ought to drop the topic, not insist on bringing it up and then claim
&gt; expertise that excuses you from defending your position.)

&gt;&gt; Since this is very off-topic (my point in bringing it up was to
illustrate
&gt;&gt; that rationality and logic are not necessarily gurantors of the truth,
which
&gt;&gt; I suspect is close to your original point, also), contact me off-line if
you
&gt;&gt; wish to continue this particular conversation.

&gt; I apologize for replying on-list when you've requested the thread be
ended.
&gt; But this is hardly off-topic when accusations of schizophrenia are made
here
&gt; on a regular basis, by persons who have not claimed any more expertise
than
&gt; you have, up to today. And &quot;regular&quot; means, in this case, with ridiculous
&gt; frequency -- Bob Grumman can barely participate (until his recent decision
&gt; to be nicer) without attempting to justify his tendency to accuse people
of
&gt; being mentally ill, and John Kennedy is likely to &quot;yell,&quot;&quot;Take your
&gt; medication, you nutcase!&quot; at (to all appearances) whomever he feels like.
&gt; At the same time, one of David Webb's favorite tactics is to remind people
&gt; that while his interlocutor's belief may _appear_ sane, the UFO people
also
&gt; believe they are sane (and I might also mention his calling me &quot;paranoid&quot;
&gt; for having used the word &quot;simulation&quot; -- in a discussion of
&gt; artificial-intelligence techniques -- for all I could figure out, because
he
&gt; assumed I thought &quot;They&quot; were trying to influence &quot;us&quot; by creating hoaxes
of
&gt; the type Art N. likes to discuss -- though it later occurred to me he
might
&gt; have been talking about phone sex).

&gt; I am happy [*] to consider that my own writing style may contribute to
this.
&gt; You may be less aware that you are not the only person who has an opinion
as
&gt; to writing style. It is inappropriate to harass someone without
permission.
&gt; Period.

&gt; * - Or rather, have been happy, in the past. I'm no longer considering
such
&gt; suggestions, not from random comers.

&gt; And _having_ considered possible problems with my own writing, I've come
to
&gt; the conclusion that those who might have thought I should change, were
wrong
&gt; as to the reasons. So it seems unlikely we are going to agree about
_which_
&gt; changes I should make. So, either you can accept that I disagree or you
&gt; cannot; that's your decision, not mine.

&gt; It is also not fair play to assume that the banter of others, because it's
&gt; incomprehensible to you, is a symptom of their being mentally ill.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt;&gt; Steese:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with Anti-Stratfordianism:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt;&gt; Reedy:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
&gt;&gt;&gt; logical
&gt;&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified.

"/>

Petzold:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That doesn't even make sense. Paranoid schizophrenia is the result of
&gt;&gt; organic imbalances in the brain. You think it's governed by some
&gt;&gt; belief system? Belief systems may be conceived and followed in the
&gt;&gt; schizophrenic mind with a great degree of rational consistency, but
&gt;&gt; not for long. Not when the context of the schizophrenic's life, as it
&gt;&gt; almost certainly would be, is known. For example, I once knew a man
&gt;&gt; who lived his whole life in campus coffeehouses, singing and playing
&gt;&gt; guitar, bumming cigarettes and change, stinking, being a goddamned
&gt;&gt; genius. His name was Keith. Keith explained how the U.S. Constitution
&gt;&gt; is a fine demonstration of Newtonian mechanics, with all its checks
&gt;&gt; and balances and proportionalism. Schizophrenic? I would guess so. And
&gt;&gt; I won't say it doesn't matter.

&gt; Your response has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.

"/>

Sure it does. You said that paranoid schizophrenia has an UNDERLYING
belief system and I said you weren't making any sense. Belief systems
are adjunct to the organic brain. Do you understand now? You also said
that schizophrenia is &quot;extremely rational and logical,&quot; but that is
only superficially true. As I added, it loses that consistency when
you come to know the context of the sufferer's life. So, contrary to
your claim, my response was appropriate on both counts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Try this. Isolate a sentence you wrote, for example, &quot;You think it's
&gt; governed by some belief system?&quot; Then take a look at what I wrote and
&gt; isolate the part you think prompted your response. Compare the two and see
&gt; if you can spot the differences.

"/>

Your condescension would have been more effective if you had been
right in the first place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem, as with
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

&gt;&gt; If I say Shakspere was a front-man for a small group of well-placed
&gt;&gt; ghostwriters, how can you deny that?

&gt; The same way you can assert it with no evidence whatsoever.

"/>

But Shakspere evinces no qualifications for having written what is
credited to him. No evidence of schooling besides inference. No
evidence of literacy besides a handful of wildly variable signatures
and the supposition that the roles he acted in required more than
memorization of his lines (a common trick of the functionally
illiterate). No evidence of intellectual stimulation except the
hot-and-cold and ambiguous testimony of Ben Jonson. No books, papers,
or letters worth mentioning. No college, travels, or any provable
contact with the nobility, the long poem dedications notwithstanding.
See, you KNOW all this stuff. He's lacking something that he
shouldn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't deny that he was an actor
&gt;&gt; and that he was a shareholder, so how can you DENY that such a person
&gt;&gt; would have been PERFECTLY qualified to have served in the role of a
&gt;&gt; front?

&gt; Why sure! It happens in comic books all the time so it must be true in real
&gt; life also, right?

"/>

Just admit that your Shakespeare is too boring to live.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Are you saying that it is absolutely impossible that some
&gt;&gt; direct and affirmative evidence of such an arrangement would NOT have
&gt;&gt; survived?

&gt; Are you saying that's a sentence?

"/>

You're right. That sentence sucked. I rephrased it in mid-stream. I
meant to ask something more like why should you expect there to be
direct evidence of Shakspere's fronting after so long a time when such
an arrangement would have been oral and under the table, anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Well, that's irrational. Secret arrangements are usually
&gt;&gt; orally made, right?

&gt; Especially in comic books, adventure novels and movies, yes.

&gt;&gt; Why should I expect to see some document outlining
&gt;&gt; his role as a front? That's irrational. And, yet, it is perfectly
&gt;&gt; rational to expect that a man of letters should have left behind some
&gt;&gt; stronger trace of his literary life than did Shakspere, but where are
&gt;&gt; those pieces of evidence?

&gt; Let's see, there's the First Folio. Does that count as a trace of a literary
&gt; life?

"/>

Certainly. But the FF was no production of Shakspere's. Says so right
on the box. Others had to step in to save &quot;his&quot; works from oblivion.
Of course, no one thought of plays as literature and here we go round
the flagpole blah blah blah... See, these things always fly in the
face or rational understanding. He cared to create great plays for the
benefit of bear-baiters and prostitutes, but was far and away the most
pirated playwright of his time. He could squeeze blood out of a
turnip, but let go the reins of his own masterpieces to unscrupulous
printers. Do a cost-benefit analysis. Why should this real estate
speculator bother to write such beautiful lines in plays that could
not have been staged uncut?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You and Kathman and whoever else can cluck

&gt;&gt; to stew in my irrationality.

&gt; Nobody's stopped you yet. Stew away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It was because of such rational belief systems that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mankind stood staring at nature for thousands of years without having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the least understanding of how it worked; it took Darwin, a man who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to put the actual evidence of the world above his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preconceptions, to come up with the first accurate description of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolution.

&gt;&gt; There's something wrong with your analogy, Mark, but I'm not smart
&gt;&gt; enough to say what it is.

&gt; I think what's wrong with his analogy is that evolution is rational.

I'm not sure I agree with that. Nature is said to be full of
superfluities and flaws.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Darwin

&gt;&gt; sophistication with natural selection. But even rational (or,
&gt;&gt; empirical) good sense can divine why square pegs don't go in round
&gt;&gt; holes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acknowledge the essentially rational nature of Anti-Stratfordianism
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because they too believe, wrongly, that the world can be explained by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason. Perhaps it's more comfortable to believe the Antis are liars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and/or madmen than to acknowledge that they are neither; they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rationalists whose particular rationalism is remarkably easy to argue

Space Cadet Pledge

&lt;&lt;For teenage viewers, the most attractive feature of the program was
that the main characters were teenagers themselves, who attended a neat,
futuristic, all-male high school. Who wouldn't mind hitting the books to
get ready for finals, knowing that when finals were over, the rocket
cruiser Polaris would be waiting on the spaceport, apparently just a few
feet beyond the classroom exit, for a glorious jaunt through the solar
system? Just like our own high school classes, Tom Corbett's
had an overachiever (Tom), a troublemaker (Roger),
an underachiever (Astro) and a brain (Alfie).&gt;&gt;

From the rocket fields of the academy
To the far-flung stars of outer space,
We are Space Cadets training to be
Ready for dangers we may face.

Up in the sky, whistling past,
Higher than high, faster than fast,
Out into space, into the sun
Look at her go when we give her the gun

We are the Space Cadets and we are proud to say
Our fight for right will nEVER cease.
Like a cosmic ray, we light the way
To interplanet peace!

Tom Corbett, Space Cadet

Space Academy, USA, in the world
beyond tomorrow. Here the Space
Cadets train for duty on distant planets.
In roaring rockets, they blast through
the millions of miles from Earth to
far-flung stars and brave the dangers of
cosmic frontiers protecting the liberties
of the planets, safeguarding the cause of
universal peace in the age of the
conquest of space!
--------------------------------------------
TOM CORBETT, SPACE CADET!

Broadcast live, 15 minutes, 3 days a week (1950-52); 30 minutes,
Saturdays, (1953-55). This was the only TV show ever to run on all 4
Golden-Age networks, and to run on two different networks
simultaneously. CBS (1950); ABC (1951-2); NBC (1951); DuMont (1953-4);
NBC (1954-5).

Broadcast history

First show, October 2, 1950
Last show June 25, 1955

Concept

In 2350, Tom Corbett enters the Space Academy to train to become an
officer of the Solar Guard. Plots depended more on hazards of space
travel than on human or space-alien menaces. The creator of Tom Corbett
was Joseph Greene, whose unproduced SPACE CADET radio scripts date to
1/16/46. Rights to use the Space Academy environment depicted by Robert
Heinlein in his 1949 novel SPACE CADET were acquired by the program's
packager, Stanley Wolfe's Rockhill Productions, in early 1950.

Directors

George Gould
Ralph Ward

Craft

The Polaris, a nuclear powered space-cruiser

Writers

Jack Weinstock and Willie Gilbert, Stu Brynes, Albert Aley, Ray
Morse, Alfred Bester, George Lowther, Richard Jessup, Frankie Thomas

Special Effects

Done by studio staff... live
Technical advisor: Willy Ley

Cast

Tom Corbett --- Frankie Thomas (command cadet)
Roger Manning --- Jan Merlin (radar deck cadet)
Astro --- Al Markim (power deck cadet)
Captain Steve Strong --- Edward Bryce
Professor Doctor Joan Dale --- Margaret Garland
Commander Arkwright --- Carter Blake
Alfie &quot;The Brain&quot; Higgins --- John Fiedler (science cadet, 1950-52)
T.J. THISTLE --- Jack Grimes (radar deck cadet, 1954-55)
Major &quot;Blastoff&quot; Connel --- Ben Stone
Eric Rattison -- Frank Sutton (command cadet, Vulcan unit)

Kraft Foods (1954-55)

The cadets' adventures were generally confined to the solar system,
with an occasional visit to a nearby solar system (Alpha Centauri,
Sirius, etc.) via hyperdrive. Monsters and aliens were very, very rarely
encountered. The program was the first to use electronic travelling
mattes for live special effects. Special effects varied widely in
quality from network to network, with the DuMont series
(alternating Saturdays with SECRET FILES OF CAPTAIN VIDEO)
having no special effects at all.

If Tom, Astro and Roger had graduated--- which they never did during
the run of the program--- they would have become officers in the Solar
Guard, a kind of interplanetary peacekeeping/police/diplomatic force.
Captain Strong was always cautioning the cadets, particularly Roger,
against the use of weapons or violence. While an occasional wandering
asteroid or comet, not to mention recalcitrant space pirates and
revolutionaries seeking the overthrow of the Solar Alliance, had to be
totally blown away by nuclear space torpedoes, fistfights were usually
sufficient to quiet down evildoers. When fists failed, the cadets could
harmlessly paralyze their foes with mysterious paralleoray beams. During
rare ship-to-ship combat, rocket cruisers were protected by &quot;ion
barriers,&quot; or &quot;force shields,&quot; with each deflected blast weakening the
shield dangerously. (Explosions of flash powder, both live on set, and
from behind the cardboard-cutout models of space ships, made these
battles fairly interesting to watch, despite the lack of Star-Wars-style
razzle-dazzle.)

Tom Corbett was hugely popular, and extensively promoted, with toys,
juvenile series books, a newspaper comic strip, a comic book, and a
radio show.

Tom Corbett's final flight occurred on June 25, 1955. Roger Manning had
been mysteriously reassigned to the Space Academy on Mars the year
before, replaced by the annoying T. J. Thistle, and Roger had never been
seen again. As usual, Astro is in danger of flunking out, and when the
Polaris blasts off on a mysterious mission, it's an even bigger blow to
his ego when he finds great rival Eric Rattison on the power deck with
him.

In the rather routine script, the Polaris finds itself the target of
space torpedoes fired by a Solar Guard squadron out to destroy a
derelict. Naturally the Cadets save the day and themselves. Although Tom
bravely says, &quot;You can count on the Polaris Unit being back at Space
Academy next year,&quot; and Thistle unpleasantly chimes in, &quot;I got some
stunts that will knock your eyes out,&quot; when the program faded on the
Kraft Caramel logo, that was the end of SPACE CADET forever. It was also
the end of the acting career of Frankie Thomas, who carved new careers
as scriptwriter, novelist and bridge expert.

TOM CORBETT ON THE RADIO

1/1/52 to 7/3/52, on the ABC Network, Tuesdays and Thursdays,
30 minutes, sponsored by Kellogg's.

It is my understanding that one of the deals offered by ABC to get
SPACE CADET away from CBS in the fall of 1950 involved a SPACE CADET
radio show, to be done by the TV cast, like the similar arrangement ABC
had with SPACE PATROL. If so, Kelloggs had to wait a long time. The
radio show did not get going until a year after the TV program's move to
ABC, and then lasted barely 6 months, ending with the run of the ABC TV
program. (After a year's layoff, the TV program moved to DuMont, then to
NBC.)

Each week's two programs followed the same story line, although each
program was fairly complete in itself, with no cliffhangers. The radio
cast was the TV cast, and the writers were often the same, with the
legendary Jackson Beck as announcer. Direction was by Drex Hines, with
scripts from Richard Jessup, the inescapable team of Jack Weinstock and
Willie Gilbert, Don Hughes, Gilbert Brann, and others. Frankie Thomas as
Tom Corbett, Al Markim as Astro and Ed Bryce as Captain Strong fought
criminals, space pirates, renegade Solar Guard officers, treacherous
colonists and various disasters of space, while keeping a wary eye out
for ill-tempered Roger Manning, as played by Jan Merlin, who tended to ...

pederasty. You would think that after that his friends would come
forth and say &quot;But he wrote Hamlet!&quot;. But no....

facts regarding Sir Thomas More:

(From G.B. Evans essay in The Riverside Shakespeare)
&quot;The evidence advanced to connect Shakespeare
with the two passages commonly attributed to him
is significantly of various kinds. The handwriting of
Addition II has been painstakingly compared with
the other six genuine Shakespeare signatures and
the only other two words known to be in Shakespeare's
hand (&quot;By me&quot;) by the eminent paleographer
Sir E. Maunde Thompson, and declared in his view
to be that of Shakespeare. But the material for
comparison is so limited that an absolute verdict
on the basis of the handwriting alone is impossible.
More persuasive than the handwriting analysis,
perhaps, is the surprisingly large number of
uncommon spelling links between Addition II and
the several quarto and First Folio texts which other
evidence leads us to believe were set up from
Shakespeare's autograph manuscripts, usually
from his &quot;foul papers&quot; (see, below, the notes to
lines 2, 8, 28, 39, 50,53,62,128,136). Shakespeare's
authorship is also strongly substantiated by what
R.W. Chambers calls &quot;the expression of ideas&quot;
(see below, in Addition II the notes to lines 10-11,
12, 39,40,72-87,77,104-13,112-14,121-22; in
Addition III, lines 1, 9, 13-17, 15, 17-18, 19-21),
and by studies of the vocabulary (see, below, in
Addition II the notes to lines 5, 7, 18, 86, 115; in
Addition III, lines 9, 11, 16, 19) the imagery (see
the references above under &quot;expression of ideas&quot;),
and the metrical characteristics. The real strength
of the case for Shakespeare's authorship of these
two passages rests, then, not on any single piece
or kind of evidence but on the quite remarkable
manner in which several independent lines of
approach support and reinforce one another in
pointing to a single conclusion - the &quot;hand&quot; of
Shakespeare.&quot;

I also refer you to the book *Shakespeare and
Sir Thomas More*, edited by Howard Hill. An essay in the book
by Charles R. Forker compares the Hand D segment with
Shakespeare's and Webster's practice. There is a long table of
results in the article, but I'll try to quickly summarize them here.
The book was published in 1989, Cambridge University Press.

self right'

Forker gives 35 total examples like this.

In his section on vocabulary, Forker says

&quot;Excluding proper names, the two additions to the More manuscript
contain 545 different words. Of these, 485 (almost 89 percent of the
total) are common to both Shakespeare and Webster. Of the remainder,
50 words (slightly more than 9 percent of the word count) appear in
Shakespeare but not in Webster. Only one word (less than one-fifth
of one percent of the total) occurs in Webster but not in Shakespeare.
Nine words from the two More additions (approximately one and a half
percent) occur in neither Shakespeare nor Webster.&quot;

If you divide the 50 words by 7.5, which is the ratio of the size of
the two canons, you still get a 6.6 to 1 ratio.

Forker's essay is in fact a response to Chillington's essay.
Chillington's essay appeared in 1980, Forker's in 1989. Here's
what Forker says about Chillington:

&quot;Chillington's case, although impressive, is less watertight than
it might at first appear. Neither the seventeenth century date
nor the link with Henslowe can be demonstrated on the basis
of external evidence, however plausible these assumptions may
seem in the light of internal pointers. I must confess that
as a longtime student of Webster's style and canon I resisted
the attribution to the Jacobean tragedian from the beginning
-but intuitively and on wholly subjective grounds, for the
style seemed to me eminently Shakespearean. It was not until
I began studying Hand D closely, using Spevack's indispensable
Complete Concordance to Shakespeare, and the equally valuable
concordance to Webster by Corballis and Harding, that I was
able to collect evidence that seems to me to justify my initial
skepticism.&quot;

This is from the essay by John Velz, also in *Shakespeare and
Sir Thomas More*, edited by Howard Hill (1989).

&quot;A new collection of essays on problems in *Sir Thomas More* ought to
re-examine the canonical approach that R.W. Chambers took to the
authorship question in Addition IIc sixty years ago. It may be that
we should extend his plausible conclusions. One recognizes the era
in Chambers conservative stance; understated conclusions were
appropriate when disintegration was crescent. Chambers was more
diffident than we might be about evidence drawn from Henry VI, Part
II, though he was bold enough to make use of Troilus and Cressida,
a play commonly rejected from the canon in his time. By 1931, when
Chambers answered the critics of his original essay, he was using
2H6 more confidently; the cast of mind one associates with
Frederick C. Fleay, E.H.C. Oliphant, and John MacKinnon Robertson
was already beginning to fade from fashion. Nevertheless, Chambers
still made no use of Titus Andronicus, a play that can be mined,
as will appear, in important support of his analysis.
A less guarded response to the canonical question is possible
now. From the seminal 1923 volume a scholarly consensus has
evolved that the 148 lines in Hand D are Shakespeare's work, and
one can go over Chambers's ground again in a stance rather more
demonstrative and suggestive than polemical. One can say now, for
instance, what Chambers would have been very reluctant to say in
1923: that Shakespeare may have been recruited to revise the scene
in which the Ill May Day Riot is quelled precisely because he had
succeeded with similar scenes in Act IV of 2H6.
Another shift in scholarly perspective was imminent when
Chambers first wrote on *More*, and it was reflected in his masterful
second essay in 1931. Influenced by the early work of Caroline
Spurgeon (and perhaps by the early work of G. Wilson Knight ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While I agree that Mr. Streitz is not &quot;representative,&quot; neither is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly anomalous -- for an Oxfordian. One need only peruse the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many rather amusing Oxfordian web sites or survey the print literature
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to confirm this assessment. (Indeed, I doubt that the concept of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;representative Oxfordian&quot; is at all meaningful. While one may choose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to represent a distribution by its mean, when the standard deviation is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excessively large, such a representation is not very meaningful.)
&gt; I'm an Oxfordian. Visit my website.  www.lynnekositsky.com  Tell me
&gt; what's weird about it. Let us go case by case.

By &quot;Oxfordian web sites,&quot; I did not mean ALL web sites owned by
Oxfordians, a sample I have not even begun to survey. Rather, I had in
mind the web sites actively promoting various forms of Oxfordian...uh...
eccentricity. Your site appears to be promoting your young adult
fiction, as one would expect, not drawing inferences about the
authorship of the Shakespeare canon from anagrams, ciphers,
consultations with a medium, speculations about Masonic conspiracies,
etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Streitz is anomalous, and of course you know that,
&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the activities of Percy Allen? See, e.g.,

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://mundoparanormal.iespana.es/mundoparanormal/docs/parapsicologia/es
&gt;&gt; critura_automatica.html&gt;.

&gt;&gt; While Mr. Streitz may draw unwarranted inferences (e.g., that the Folger
&gt;&gt; trustees KNOW that their portrait of Hugh Hammersley is really Oxford
&gt;&gt; because they refused to sell the canvas to Mr. Streitz), but as far as I
&gt;&gt; know Mr. Streitz has not thus far consulted a medium in his historical
&gt;&gt;&quot;research.&quot; We have already discussed Raeto West, whose now defunct web
&gt;&gt; page contained material that made Mr. Streitz look like a mere amateur
&gt;&gt; crank. We have also discussed Lord Burford, who is surely at least as
&gt;&gt; anomalous as Mr. Streitz. Have you read _Shakespeare and the Tudor
&gt;&gt; Rose_ by Elisabeth Sears? Have you read any of Art Neuendorffer's posts
&gt;&gt; (e.g., the one in which he triumphantly adduces the supposed anagram &quot;I
&gt;&gt; kill Edwasd de Vese&quot;? Have you seen

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.pe.net/%7Ewebrebel/Anagrams2.html&gt;?

&gt;&gt; For that matter, have you read _This Star of England_? While Mr.
&gt;&gt; Streitz may not be &quot;representative,&quot; to the extent that such a locution
&gt;&gt; makes sense, he is certainly not particularly anomalous, at least for an
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian. His opinions on the etiology of AIDS or on the Bernoulli
&gt;&gt; Principle are no more eccentric than Mr. Crowley's &quot;aquatic ape&quot; beliefs
&gt;&gt; or Stephanie Caruana's &quot;Gemstone&quot; conspiracy theory.

&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise you'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend a lot more time speaking of others.

&gt;&gt; Consider it done.
&gt; On second thoughts...

I rest my case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes, I think you've mentioned before that the deviation from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean among Oxfordians (is that the correct term? It's a long time
&gt;&gt;&gt; since I did stats) is likely greater than that among Stratfordians.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And I believe that's true because Oxfordians journey further from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean on both sides as they tend to be more adventurous than
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians in their thinking.
&gt;&gt; Repudiation of the Bernoulli Principle can scarcely be characterized
&gt;&gt; as &quot;adventurousness&quot;; indeed, &quot;crankery&quot; is more the _mot juste_.
&gt; But we keep going over the same material. This must be at least the
&gt; third or fourth time you've mentioned the repudiation of the Bernoulli
&gt; Principle.

Well, you're the one who used the word &quot;adventurous.&quot; I'm merely
pointing out that if one characterizes such superb exemplars of
anti-Stratfordian folly as Mr. Streitz's opinions on fluid dynamics and
the etiology of AIDS, Mr. Crowley's expertise on aquatic apes, Elizabeth
Weir's nutcase anti-Einstein fulminations (simultaneously claiming that
special relativity is wrong, AND that Einstein &quot;plagerized [sic]&quot; the
theory), Ken Kaplan's confident pronouncements on conversations with the
dead, &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker's belief that the Apollo lunar landing was faked (and
his farcical &quot;solution&quot; of Fermat's Last Theorem), Stephanie Caruana's
&quot;Gemstone&quot; conspiracy theory, Art's multifaceted Masonic conspiracy,
various anti-Stratfordians' takes on the Kennedy assassination, Percy
Allen's seances, Raeto West's views on virtually everything (from modern
physics to biology to the history of the Shoah) etc. as &quot;adventurous,&quot;
then one is applying the designation to much that manifestly crosses the
line from adventurousness into pure, unalloyed crankery.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, there do seem to be certain

&gt; I believe you have badly misunderstood me, Terry. I wasn't talking in
&gt; the least about attribution of the canon. If you look back at the entire

&gt; didn't refer to Shakespeare writing the canon.

A few lines previously, you had quoted your own use of the word &quot;case,&quot;
referring to Shakespeare:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
&gt;&gt; People who might only have been able to sign their names might not
&gt;&gt; have been able to read at all. They could have been taught to sign
&gt;&gt; their name at home (doubtful in Shakespeare's case) or by someone they
&gt;&gt; knew who was at least somewhat literate.

"/>

Shakespeare seems to be the special &quot;case&quot; for whom antistratfordians
require special interpretive rules. What is the evidence that Shakespeare
&quot;might only have been able to sign his name&quot;? Marlowe left only a single
signature (without even a &quot;by me&quot;), but you don't seem to think of him as
someone who &quot;might only have been able to sign his name&quot; -- but Marlowe, I
suppose, is a different &quot;case.&quot;

Here is an earlier instance of your use of &quot;proof&quot; in the same thread:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not have a
&gt;&gt; grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by way of a
&gt;&gt; list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

&gt;&gt; Whether a grammar school education--which he may or may not have
&gt;&gt; had--would fit him to be the writer of the canon is another matter
&gt;&gt; entirely.

"/>

We have no &quot;list of attenders&quot; for Ben Jonson. We have no such list for
George Chapman. We have no such list for Michael Drayton. We have no
such list for John Webster, or Thomas Dekker, or Cyril Tourneur. There
is, therefore, no &quot;proof&quot; that any of these men had even a grammar school
education -- to say nothing of whether a grammar school education would
have fit them to write the works attributed to them. Shakespeare,
however, is not classed with them by antistratfordians; Shakespeare is a
special &quot;case.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It referred back to a previous post, the gist of which was that if we
&gt; have evidence that someone in Tudor Times could sign his name, but we
&gt; have no other writing samples from him, it is impossible in the absolute
&gt; sense to know whether he could write more than that or whether he could
&gt; read.

"/>

Like the possibly illiterate Christopher Marlowe -- it is &quot;impossible in
the absolute sense to know whether he could write more than that or
whether he could read.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do, however, (for at least the fourth time) believe that Shakespeare
&gt; of Stratford could probably read as he was an actor.

"/>

Alas, Marlowe was not an actor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you know me better than to suggest I would say there is &quot;no
&gt; proof of anything&quot; as regards the authorship question.

"/>

I know you are not of the Sobran/Brame-Popova &quot;Oxford wrote everything&quot;
school,&quot; so I think there MUST be Elizabethan attributions (other than to
Oxford), that you accept -- but I do not know which ones. I should think
you probably accept Sidney's authorship of *Astrophil &amp; Stella* and
Spenser's of *The Shepheardes Calender* (I was not picking particularly
tough cases), but I would be relieved to hear you confirm that you do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; If your point is that nobody can ever offer &quot;proof&quot; of anything, or that
&gt;&gt; no Elizabethan attribution meets your standards of &quot;proof,&quot; then the &quot;no
&gt;&gt; proof of anything in this case&quot; claim is misleading, as it suggests that
&gt;&gt; there is something peculiar about &quot;this case.&quot; If, on the other hand, you
&gt;&gt; believe that most, or at least some of the generally accepted attributions
&gt;&gt; of Elizabethan works are based on &quot;proof,&quot; then perhaps you tell us about
&gt;&gt; a few of those cases, so we will know what you mean by &quot;proof&quot; in this
&gt;&gt; context.

&gt; Again, please see my answer above. You're way off base. As Stephen
&gt; Leacock once said of one of his characters, Lord Ronald: &quot;He flung
&gt; himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.&quot;

"/>

He must have ridden with Bedford Forrest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Is there some reason why the attributions of Shakespeare's works should
&gt;&gt; NOT be decided using criteria that could be applied to works by other
&gt;&gt; authors?

&gt; Of course not.

"/>

So can you tell me whether you accept Spenser's authorship of *The
Shepheardes Calender* or Sidney's of *Astrophil and Stella*? If so, can
you tell us why? If not, can you tell us whether there are any
Elizabethan attributions that you do accept?

&gt; It's irrelevant to the fact that some people may have learned to write
&gt; their name by copying and fashioning letters without first or ever
&gt; learning how to read.

"/>

It is indeed a fact that it is physically possible for people
to learn to write their name before they know how to read.
On the other hand, if I combine the order of instruction
with the then high price of paper, it seems to me that
it is very probable that few Elizabethan children learned
to sign their names before they learned to read. And if the
order of instruction was such that it makes it seem
probable that very few Elizabethans learned to sign their
names before they learned to read, then surely it is
relevant to the issue of whether or not there is any
significant chance that Shakespeare was a non-reading
signer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; knew who was at least somewhat literate.

&gt;&gt; Do you think that non-reader signers have ever been common?
&gt;&gt; If so, why? If not, why should we imagine Shakespeare was
&gt;&gt; one of the relatively rare exceptions?

&gt; I have no idea. I believe it's one of the things we can't know. And
&gt; that's why we can't theorise that Shakespeare of Stratford was a good
&gt; reader or writer.

"/>

If sufficient evidence exists to prove that he was
who we think he was, then we know perfectly well
that he was a good reader and a writer. If we had
proof that he wasn't a good reader or writer, then
we'd have to consider whether or not it outweighs
the rest of the evidence. Needless to say, we
don't have anything close to a proof that he wasn't
a good reader or writer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I happen to believe he could probably read as he was

If the conjecture in the sentence above is that his
acting makes it probable that he could read, it is
a very good conjecture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot find that John asserted that there could be NO exceptions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather, the natural implication of what John said is that it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REASONABLE to conjecture that Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school, in view of his documented profession, in view of the copious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the existence of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; letter written to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here you go defending John again. He did a rather good job of it
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself. And if you don't think that &quot;Rather, the natural implication
&gt;&gt;&gt; of what John said is that it is REASONABLE to conjecture that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare attended the Stratford grammar school...in view of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; copious evidence of his literary activity, and in view of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of a letter written to him&quot; is a circular argument, then we
&gt;&gt;&gt; must disagree on what a circular argument is.

&gt;&gt; Premises:

&gt;&gt; Evidence of literary activity.
&gt;&gt; Existence of a letter written to him.

&gt;&gt; Conclusion:

&gt;&gt; Probably attended the grammar school.

&gt;&gt; For it to be circular, the premises would
&gt;&gt; have to depend upon the conclusion. Do you
&gt;&gt; think that the &quot;Evidence of literary activity&quot;
&gt;&gt; depends upon the idea that he &quot;probably
&gt;&gt; attended the grammar school&quot;? It doesn't.
&gt;&gt; (Each of the bits of evidence that show us
&gt;&gt; that Shakespeare of Stratford was active
&gt;&gt; in a literary sense is logically independent
&gt;&gt; of where (or if) he went to school.)

&gt; You guys are saying he probably attended grammar school because of his
&gt; literary activity, but the premise of his literary activity, rests,
&gt; among other factors, on his having attended grammar school.

"/>

If we ignore the fact that he could have learned to read and
write outside of grammar school, that's true, but it doesn't
make the argument circular.

Let's, for example, suppose that we wanted to prove that you
most likely went to school. We could take a look at the
evidence for your literary activities(your name on the
title of books, your claims that you make a living from
writing, etc.), note that such activities imply that you
are literate, note that most literates have had some
schooling, and suppose from that that you very likely
have attended one or more schools. Despite the fact
that the premise of your literary activity depends in
part on your literacy, there isn't a hint of circularity
in the argument.

If some Stratfordian was such a nutter as to say that
because the glover's son was most likely literate,
the literary activities of Shakespeare are known to
be his, and that because of those activities, he
was most certainly literate, that'd be circularity.
(I have yet to run across any Stratfordian who has
been so lame.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's you
&gt; Stratfordians who keep saying that, not I. His probable attendance at
&gt; school figures large in almost all the standard biogs, and that's
&gt; because if he hadn't gone to school and learned to read and write, he
&gt; couldn't be the author of the canon.

"/>

It's true that Shakespeare being Shakespeare implies
that Shakespeare most likely went to school. It's
also true that with the loss of the Stratford school
records, we don't have any direct record of him going
to school. But so what? If all of your school
records went up in smoke, would we be wrong to
conclude from your literary activities that you
probably went to school? Would we be wrong
to take what we know about UK schools in general
and suppose that we might know something about
your school experiences?

In any event, the evidence for William Shakespeare
being literate doesn't even rest entirely upon his
literary activities...

-----

Upwardly mobile father who intended to be
a gentleman in a time when the sons of gentlemen
were expected to be literate.

Local school that he could have attended for free.

Actor in the premiere acting company in England
in a time when most actors appear to have been literate.

Six extant(generally acknowledged) signatures.

Extant letter written to him.

An extant signature from one brother. (No extant
marks from any brothers.)

-----

Sounds to me like someone who was probably literate.

-----

If I were to add in things like &quot;Paid for the composition
of an impresa.&quot;, &quot;Name found on the title pages of printed
works.&quot;, &quot;Contemporaries implied that the author was an
actor.&quot;, &quot;Contemporaries implied that the author was from
Stratford.&quot; etc., I'd be adding in the literary activities
John was talking about, and then there really is very very
little doubt. And that, of course, is the place that the
authors of the biographies are coming from.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; One letter? Did I actually see that? One letter that to my knowledge
&gt;&gt;&gt; was never delivered?

&gt;&gt; Do you really think that non-delivery is relevant?

&gt; Of course. The author of the letter suddenly remembered that
&gt; Shakespeare couldn't read, and so visited him instead. ;)

&gt;&gt; Well. Finally we have something that resembles a substantive point, as thin
&gt;&gt; as it is. At least it is not a generic call to politeness.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
&gt;&gt;&gt; People who might only have been able to sign their names might not

&gt;&gt;&quot;might not have been able to read&quot;
&gt;&gt;&quot;could have been taught&quot;

&gt;&gt; These are strange reactions from a person who, on another thread, says,
&gt;&gt;&quot;I'm
&gt;&gt; also alarmed at the number of books on Shakespeare of Stratford that employ
&gt;&gt; the terms 'could have, should
&gt;&gt; have, would have.'&quot;

&gt; Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote
&gt; the canon.

"/>

I believe that you are confusing biography (which is perforce
speculative) with literary attribution here.

By analogy, there is abundant evidence that one Lynne Kositsky wrote
_A Question of Will_, _Rebecca's Flame_, _Candles_, and several other
highly regarded works of fiction. The evidence is robust enough that I
have no reason to question the attribution, and indeed I would be
foolhardy to do so. True, I have never seen the grammar school records
attesting that the abovementioned Lynne Kositsky is literate -- indeed,
I doubt that I could gain access to those records even if I tried -- yet
I certainly do not doubt for a moment the literacy of Ms. Kositksy.

I cannot with any certainty reconstruct her educational trajectory --
she may have been educated in England, in Canada, or elsewhere, in
public schools or private institutions, or she might even have been home
schooled. Thus any biographical reconstruction I could undertake would
perforce be mere speculation, and I would label it as such. I would
conjecture that Ms. Kositsky was educated for the most part in England
-- indeed, her writing contains occasional locutions that one would not
find in the speech of someone whose formative years had been spent in
Canada or in the U.S. I have read that she has spent time as an
educator, so I presume that as a prerequisite for that profession she
must have had some training and very probably a degree in education, but
I cannot say so with certainty, as I have not seen her diplomas.
Nevertheless, in view of her documented career trajectory, it is a
REASONABLE assumption that she has a degree in education. Thus, while I
am certain that Ms. Kositsky is literate -- indeed, far more than
literate: articulate, in fact -- I cannot reconstruct the details of her
education. Therefore I find nothing incompatible in being virtually
certaint about Shakespeare's literacy, yet being uncertain about the
detailed means by which he attained that proficiency.

If I thought like an Oxfordian (Ne dai mne Bog soiti s uma, as
Pushkin wrote), I might be perplexed concerning the apparent
incongruities between Ms. Kositsky's art and the few scraps of
biographical information that I possess about her. For example, Ms.
Kositsky has published works in the Our Canadian Girl Series -- how did
Ms. Kositsky acquire such unerring insight into Canadian girlhood as to
permit the composition of a virtual _Bildunsroman_ when by all
indications Ms. Kositsky herself grew up in a very different culture on
a different continent a vast ocean away -- indeed, in a country many of
whose denizens know no more about life in Canada than they do about life
in Pakistan, say? Ms. Kositsky has also written fiction concerning the
Holocaust, yet by reason of age alone Ms. Kositsky plainly cannot have
had direct personal experience of that unthinkable ordeal. The topic of
the Shoah is not one on which an author can afford to hit even a single
false note, both in deference to the memory of the victims and by virtue
of the importance of the collective memory of the culture, yet Ms.
Kositsky's versimilitude is evidently so highly regarded that she was
awarded multiple grants to facilitate its composition. How does she do
it? Finally, Ms. Kositsky has written or is writing another work
concerning the Acadians of Nova Scotia, another milieu in which she has
no direct experience, but which one expects her to reconstruct
imaginatively and convincingly. Plainly -- at least to an Oxfordian --
this glaring mismatch between literary canon and biography must raise
serious questions. Could &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot; be a pseudonym for a widely
traveled aristocrat? Could the real Lynne Kositsky be an illiterate or
scarcely literate &quot;front&quot; for someone who is precluded by virtue of his
station from a pursuit as frivolous as the composition of children's
literature? Dark, disturbing thoughts, as Charles Kinbote would say.

Fortunately, however, I do not think like an Oxfordian. I have no
doubt about Lynne Kositsky's literacy, however patchy, speculative, and
incomplete my conjectural reconstruction of her education may be. Nor
do I require documentary proof of her education (transcripts, diplomas,
employment records, etc.) to convince me that Lynne Kositsky is indeed
the author of the highly regarded literary works attributed to Lynne
Kositsky, and that she is therefore literate.

&gt;&gt; I can't remember.

&gt; If you can't even remember, then surely the lapse could not been
&gt; anywhere NEAR as cretinous as declaring Caxton to have been a
&gt; contemporary of Shakespeare, claiming that Meres's encomium named
&gt; Oxford, or identifying Anne Hathaway as Shakespeare's mother. There are
&gt; degrees of ignorance and incompetence, and no &quot;Stratfordian&quot; scholar
&gt; known to me has ever, even in an unguarded moment, said anything
&gt; betraying the sort of farcical incompetence displayed by each of the
&gt; examples I enumerated. Yet one of these howlers actually appears in an
&gt; Oxfordian book, and another is part of an &quot;argument&quot; adduced by someone
&gt; whose now-defunct web site proclaimed her to be &quot;one of the leading
&gt; Oxfordian researchers&quot;! My point stands.

&gt;&gt; I was dreadfully ill at the time, but I do know it
&gt;&gt; was one of the contributors to *Shakespeare's Face*, either Jonathan
&gt;&gt; Bate or Andrew Gurr, who wrote a whole chapter that totally infuriated
&gt;&gt; Nelson. He really ripped him. Both chapters seem pretty ludicrous to
&gt;&gt; me and that's why I'm having problems. Someone else will remember for
&gt;&gt; sure and I'll be glad to ask if you'd like to know.

&gt; Yes, I would be curious.

"/>

It was Andrew Gurr that Nelson was ripping. Gurr's chapter in
*Shakespeare's Face* does contain an unfortunate number of
errors, but they were mostly casual errors that suggest hasty
writing, rather than major gaffes. For example, Gurr said in
the chapter that Shakespeare received no salary as a Groom
of the Chamber, but Nelson pointed out that the King's Men did
receive regular payments under King James for their services
as Grooms.

the vast welter of writings about Shakespeare CRANK references alone
numbered more th 4,000 items. In _Knotted Doughnuts_ I discuss
the writings of two of the funniest Baconian CRANKS of all time:
Ignatius Donnelly and the MAD Elizabeth Wells Gallup.&gt;&gt;
- _Who Was Shakespeare?_ (1992) by Martin Gardner

&lt;&lt;Ignatius Donnelly, used a system even more farfetched for his 1,000
page CRANK work _The Great Cryptogram_ (1888). This tome and Donnelly's
_Atlantis_ and _Ragnarok_ form the most impressive set of CRACKPOT works
written by an American before 1900. It remained for Mrs. Elizabeth Wells
Gallup (1846-1934), to apply Bacon's cipher to Shakespeare's plays,
producing the best and most hilarious plaintexts in the history of
Baconiana. Like Donnelly, Mrs. Gallup is a splendid specimen of the
intelligent learned, honest and THOROUGHLY SELF-DELUDED CRANK. . .
[the Friedman] book _The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined_ totally
demolish Mrs. Gallup's monumental and PATHETIC lifetime labors. . .
Someone ought to write a book about the SAD life of Mrs. Gallup.&gt;&gt;

&gt; He must have ridden with Bedford Forrest.

"/>

&lt;&lt;On June 10, 1864, the U.S. Army suffered one of its most humiliating
defeats at the hands of a man who, not only defied the textbook on tactics,
but also had never read it. Bedford Forrest's victory at Brice's Crossroads
exemplified a new role for the cavalry that would carry its name into the
mechanized wars of the 20th Century. That Bedford Forrest was an &quot;untutored
genius&quot; is widely known, but the suggestion by some of his peers that a West
Point education would have made him more formidable is unlikely. The fact
that he had no preconceived notions about strategy and tactics made him
unpredictable. His natural ability to quickly evaluate a situation and act
decisively set him apart from the more predictable West Point graduates. He
was not able to drill a company beyond the most basic commands and
considered anything more &quot;an unnecessary tax upon men and horses&quot;. An
example of his &quot;unorthodox&quot; evaluation of a tactical situation occurred
during Hood's retreat after the disastrous Nashville campaign. Forrest, in
charge of the rear-guard, had decided to make a stand against the pursuing
Federals at a place south of Pulaski, Tennessee called Anthony's Hill.
Reports that his flanks had been turned had unnerved his officers and they
were suggesting a withdrawal. When he was told that the enemy was in his
rear, he snapped, &quot; Well, that means I'm in their rear too!&quot; Disgusted with
his officers' timidity, he rode off muttering, &quot;I always carry my rear
around with me&quot;. Forrest was the antithesis of the blue-blood autocrats that
comprised most of the officer corps. Many of them considered him an &quot;uncouth
vulgarian&quot; and his contempt for their snobbery manifested in several
conflagrations. During the pursuit of the Federals after Brice's Crossroads,
Forrest and some of his men came upon a group of burning supply wagons.
After ordering his men to dismount and extinguish the fires, he noticed a
lieutenant sitting on his horse and asked him why he didn't help. &quot;I'm an
officer,&quot; was the reply. &quot;I'll officer you!&quot; shouted Forrest and the
lieutenant was involuntarily dismounted by his commanding general. On
another occasion, an officer who had refused to help row a boat in Forrest's
presence quickly found himself swimming for his life in the Tennessee River.
Of course, Forrest pulled no punches with his superiors either and usually
ran afoul of all of them; considering them as foolish as the enemy
commanders he fought against. As a result, many of his most brilliant
victories were achieved in theatres of little strategic importance. By the
time Forrest was considered as more than a &quot;raider&quot;, it was too late for a
man of his talent to save the Confederacy.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; The problem, as with anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying

"/>

I don't need to deny it. There isn't a jot of evidence to support it;
absent such evidence, the possibility doesn't merit consideration. In my
opinion, the false assumption underlying your belief system is that William
Shakespeare could not have written his own works. (The false underlying
assumption of some pro-Stratfordians -- KQKnave and Bob Grumman, to name
two -- is that William Shakespeare's accomplishment was nothing out of the
ordinary; to KQKnave, William was just a talented fellow who worked hard;
to Bob, he was just in the right place at the right time with the right
genes.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't deny that he was an actor and that he was a shareholder, so

It makes no difference whether or not he was qualified to play such a role
unless you can produce evidence that he *did* play such a role.
Shakespeare was also PERFECTLY qualified to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I
from the stage of the Globe; he was PERFECTLY qualified to kill his rival,
Christopher Marlowe; he was PERFECTLY qualified to do any number of things
that there is no evidence to indicate he did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No. I'm saying that until some direct and affirmative evidence of such an
arrangement is produced, speculating about the possibility that it existed
is vain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, that's irrational. Secret arrangements are usually orally made,
&gt; right? Why should I expect to see some document outlining his role as
&gt; a front? That's irrational.

"/>

Neither of those points is in the least irrational. It looks to me like
you're falling into the same trap some of the pro-Stratfordians fall into,
the assumption that two opposing viewpoints cannot both be rational. This
is incorrect.

My position, however, is strictly empirical. Maybe there was a secret
arrangement. Maybe Oxford faked his own death. Maybe Marlowe faked *his*.
Any of these things could have happened, but without supporting evidence
there is no point in considering them.

One of the problems with eliminating Shakespeare as a suspect is that you
are left with far too many other possible authors: because there is no
evidence for anyone other than Shakespeare, eliminating him effectively
makes every literate man and woman in Elizabethan England a candidate for
the honor. (Maybe Thomas Nashe faked *his* death...)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, yet, it is perfectly rational to expect that a man of letters should
&gt; have left behind some stronger trace of his literary life than did
&gt; Shakspere,

"/>

Yes, it's rational. That only demonstrates my point about the problems
with rational expectations. It's rational to suppose that there would be
extensive records of the scandal caused by _The Ile of Dogs_, a play by
Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson, the 'seditious' contents of which caused
Jonson to be imprisoned and Nashe to flee London one step ahead of a
warrant for his arrest. But as it happens, we have no idea why the play
caused such a scandal: there are no extant copies of the text, and no
surviving documents describe its contents. The repercussions of the
scandal affected the entire theatrical community -- the Privy Council
ordered the closure of all the theaters in London -- and it is devilishly
frustrating that we can only guess at the reasons; but them's the facts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but where are those pieces of evidence? You and Kathman and whoever else
&gt; can cluck and chirp all you want about what should and should not be
&gt; expected for a man of that station and time, but I just want a piece of
&gt; manuscript. A single fucking letter. A dog-eared book. Oh, well...back
&gt; to stew in my irrationality.

"/>

You're responding to the person who said your belief system was *rational*
now, Toby. For what it's worth, I share your frustration about the absence
of personal effects from Shakespeare's life; I also feel a keen sense of
frustration over the absence of evidence for the lives and thoughts of the
other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights (Ben Jonson being the exception
- and even in his case, there are vast gaps in the record).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; It was because of such rational belief systems that mankind stood
&gt;&gt;&gt; staring at nature for thousands of years without having the least
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding of how it worked; it took Darwin, a man who was
&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to put the actual evidence of the world above his
&gt;&gt;&gt; preconceptions, to come up with the first accurate description
&gt;&gt;&gt; of evolution.

&gt; There's something wrong with your analogy, Mark

"/>

Well, it's not an analogy, for one thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but I'm not smart enough to say what it is. Obviously, prehistoric
&gt; man DID know a lot about how Nature worked, even if it wasn't at a
&gt; level of theoretical sophistication with natural selection. But even
&gt; rational (or, empirical) good sense can divine why square pegs don't
&gt; go in round holes.

"/>

I like that &quot;rational (or, empirical)&quot; part. It was precisely because
people who sought to understood nature took a rationalist approach rather
than an empirical approach that they failed to come up with anything useful
for so many centuries. My phrasing was unfortunately imprecise, for which
my apologies; I should have written &quot;without understanding how nature
worked *as a whole*&quot;. People acquired a substantial amount of practical
knowledge about animals and plants; no one could see the underlying
pattern.

The pernicious effects of religious rationalism on the development of
science should not be underestimated. For example, it was widely believed
in Europe and America, right up to the 19th Century, that the Book of
Nature revealed the Hand of God, which was a perfectly rational, and
utterly incorrect, assumption. Thomas Jefferson, who was by no means a
Biblical literalist, believed that there must be living mastodons somewhere
in North America because he thought it impossible that any living species
could have gone extinct. Why? Because there's nothing about extinction in
the Bible, so it couldn't be part of God's plan.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely to
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever acknowledge the essentially rational nature of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anti-Stratfordianism because they too believe, wrongly, that the

&gt;&gt;&gt; believe the Antis are liars and/or madmen than to acknowledge that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they are neither; they are simply rationalists whose particular

&gt; the writings of two of the funniest Baconian CRANKS of all time:
&gt; Ignatius Donnelly and the MAD Elizabeth Wells Gallup.&gt;&gt;
&gt; - _Who Was Shakespeare?_ (1992) by Martin Gardner

It's a pity that he's presumably unaware of a more recent Baconian
Elizabeth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;&lt;Ignatius Donnelly, used a system even more farfetched for his 1,000
&gt; page CRANK work _The Great Cryptogram_ (1888). This tome and Donnelly's
&gt; _Atlantis_ and _Ragnarok_ form the most impressive set of CRACKPOT works
&gt; written by an American before 1900. It remained for Mrs. Elizabeth Wells
&gt; Gallup (1846-1934), to apply Bacon's cipher to Shakespeare's plays,
&gt; producing the best and most hilarious plaintexts in the history of
&gt; Baconiana. Like Donnelly, Mrs. Gallup is a splendid specimen of the
&gt; intelligent learned, honest and THOROUGHLY SELF-DELUDED CRANK. . .
&gt; [the Friedman] book _The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined_ totally
&gt; demolish Mrs. Gallup's monumental and PATHETIC lifetime labors. . .
&gt; Someone ought to write a book about the SAD life of Mrs. Gallup.&gt;&gt;

&gt; Certainly, neither Martin Gardner nor Dave Webb
&gt; would ever blunder about 'facts':

Certainly both have, and I at least have thanked my interlocutor for
the correction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; However, a delusion is a VERy different matter. Once Gardner has
&gt;&gt; been corrected, you can expect him to acknowledge it gratefully,
&gt;&gt; as I do.

&gt;&gt; By contrast, those who are truly deluded (e.g., Richard Kennedy,
&gt;&gt; aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut, _et al_) generally just go right on
&gt;&gt; blithely spouting nonsense, oblivious to evidence, even after having
&gt;&gt; been corrected decisively and repeatedly.
&gt; Ergo, we must learn to distinguish between
&gt; those who make errors and &quot;the truly deluded.&quot;

Quite right, Art -- see how quickly you can catch on when you try?
For an example of the truly deluded, you might seek someone who is still
frantically trying to salvage her ridiculous assertion that Old English
was spoken in some parts of England as late as the 1800s, as well as her
farcical anti-Einsteinian crankery, despite having been proven wrong
decisively in both cases. Or, you might seek the truly deluded in
someone who, despite having been proven wrong concerning the senses of
the word &quot;moniment&quot; in use in early 1600s, persists in believing that
references to Shakespeare's &quot;moniment&quot; referred to something other than
the monument.

What poor comprehension! Bob did not say the signature was sophisticated;
he said the kind of shorthand was sophisticated.

You simplify these things for yourself, missing the point entirely.
The shorthand shows the sophistication (selective evolution based

employing your slight misinterpretations of the words you read.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides, many people who were functionally illiterate learned to

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no overwhelming evidence to suggest he either did or did not

&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons there is doubt among the different anti-Stratfordian groups
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he wrote the plays. His father was well to do but fell into
&gt;&gt;&gt; disgrace. And how do we know how ambitious he was? He seemed more
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambitious, according to the new Wood book and film, with regard to
&gt;&gt;&gt; making money. He did so, in the main part, by conducting illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; transactions in fleece (Wood shows us the court records in his film).
&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to suggest that teaching his son to read was not as high on
&gt;&gt;&gt; his list of priorities as teaching him to make money by nefarious
&gt;&gt;&gt; means. But this is just conjecture, as are most statements with regard
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Shakespeare and his family.

I have already explained to Elizabeth in another thread that I was
referring to Groucho, not Karl, Marx, but she evidently has not caught
on yet. Her incomprehension is no surprise -- indeed, when Elizabeth
began consistently referring to Professor J.-P. Hsu as &quot;your Dartmouth
colleague&quot; I had to tell her MANY times that Professor J.-P. Hsu is at
U. Mass. Dartmouth, located in a completely different state, before the
information finally sank in. Matters being so, I would not care to
guess how many times I will have to inform Elizabeth that I was
referring to Groucho, not Karl, Marx, before the light dawns; perhaps
she will have gotten it by Christmas, but I doubt it. In any case, as I
already said, she probably imagines that Karl was just another one of
the Marx brothers, so that Groucho would surely have been a committed
coreligionist of Karl.

However, just out of curiosity, what are the other three ideologies
to which Elizabeth alludes, apart from my putative Grouchoist ideology?

&lt;&lt;The classic Greek lyre harps were called &quot;Kithara&quot;
which was a term used for describing all kinds of harps
and lyres. The modern word &quot;guitar&quot; came from the word Kithara.
According to Greek mythology, Hermes created the harp lyre from
the body of a large tortoise shell, which he covered with animal hide;
antelope horns formed the posts.

So beautiful was the tone that he presented the instrument
as an offering to the God Apollo. The lyre harp became regarded
as the instrument of Apollo, the god of music &amp; harmony.

Lyres came to be associated with the higher Apollonian virtues of
wisdom, serenity, clarity, moderation and communication. In contrast,
the music of the Dionysians was performed on raucous Reed instruments
with wild abandon. Greek mythology portrays Orpheus, the divine harp
lyre player, who charmed the Lord of the Underworld Pluto in order
to bring back his wife from the dead. Orpheus played this lyre harp to
inspire Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece.

It was Orpheus' melodies that blocked out the brainwashing
sirens intent on inciting listeners to their destruction.&gt;&gt;

Tramp Abroad - Mark Twain ** ( CHAPTER XVI )

And I will refresh the reader's memory by printing the legend
of the Lorelei, too. I have it by me in the LEGENDS OF
THE RHINE, done into English by the wildly gifted Garnham,
Bachelor of Arts. I print the legend partly to refresh
my own memory, too, for I have never read it before.
THE LEGEND
Lore (two syllables) was a water nymph who used to sit
on a high rock called the Ley or Lei (pronounced like our
word LIE) in the Rhine, and lure boatmen to destruction
in a furious rapid which marred the channel at that spot.
She so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her
wonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze
up at her, and so they presently drifted among the broken
reefs and were lost.
In those old, old times, the Count Bruno lived in a great
castle near there with his son, the Count Hermann, a youth
of twenty. Hermann had heard a great deal about the
beautiful Lore, and had finally fallen very deeply in love
with her without having seen her. So he used to wander
to the neighborhood of the Lei, evenings, with his Zither
and &quot;Express his Longing in low Singing,&quot; as Garnham says.
On one of these occasions, &quot;suddenly there hovered around
the top of the rock a brightness of unequaled clearness
and color, which, in increasingly smaller circles thickened,
was the enchanting figure of the beautiful Lore.
&quot;An unintentional cry of Joy escaped the Youth, he let
his Zither fall, and with extended arms he called out
the name of the enigmatical Being, who seemed to stoop
lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly manner;
indeed, if his ear did not deceive him, she called his
name with unutterable sweet Whispers, proper to love.
Beside himself with delight the youth lost his Senses
and sank senseless to the earth.&quot;
After that he was a changed person. He went dreaming about,
thinking only of his fairy and caring for naught else
in the world. &quot;The old count saw with affliction this
changement in his son,&quot; whose cause he could not divine,
and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels,
but to no purpose. Then the old count used authority.
He commanded the youth to betake himself to the camp.
Obedience was promised. Garnham says:
&quot;It was on the evening before his departure, as he
wished still once to visit the Lei and offer to the
Nymph of the Rhine his Sighs, the tones of his Zither,
and his Songs. He went, in his boat, this time accompanied
by a faithful squire, down the stream. The moon shed
her silvery light over the whole country; the steep
bank mountains appeared in the most fantastical shapes,
and the high oaks on either side bowed their Branches
on Hermann's passing. As soon as he approached the Lei,
and was aware of the surf-waves, his attendant was seized
with an inexpressible Anxiety and he begged permission
to land; but the Knight swept the strings of his Guitar
and sang:
&quot;Once I saw thee in dark night, In supernatural Beauty bright;
Of Light-rays, was the Figure wove, To share its light,
locked-hair strove.
&quot;Thy Garment color wave-dove By thy hand the sign of love,
Thy eyes sweet enchantment, Raying to me, oh! enchantment.
&quot;O, wert thou but my sweetheart, How willingly thy love
to part! With delight I should be bound To thy rocky
house in deep ground.&quot;
That Hermann should have gone to that place at all,
was not wise; that he should have gone with such a song
as that in his mouth was a most serious mistake. The Lorelei
did not &quot;call his name in unutterable sweet Whispers&quot;
this time. No, that song naturally worked an instant
and thorough &quot;changement&quot; in her; and not only that,
but it stirred the bowels of the whole afflicted region
around about there -- for --
&quot;Scarcely had these tones sounded, everywhere there
began tumult and sound, as if voices above and below
the water. On the Lei rose flames, the Fairy stood above,
at that time, and beckoned with her right hand clearly
and urgently to the infatuated Knight, while with a staff
in her left hand she called the waves to her service.
They began to mount heavenward; the boat was upset,
mocking every exertion; the waves rose to the gunwale,
and splitting on the hard stones, the Boat broke into Pieces.
The youth sank into the depths, but the squire was thrown on
shore by a powerful wave.&quot;
The bitterest things have been said about the Lorelei
during many centuries, but surely her conduct upon this
occasion entitles her to our respect. One feels drawn
tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her many crimes
and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed
her career.
&quot;The Fairy was never more seen; but her enchanting tones have
often been heard. In the beautiful, refreshing, still nights
of spring, when the moon pours her silver light over the Country,
the listening shipper hears from the rushing of the waves,
the echoing Clang of a wonderfully charming voice,
which sings a song from the crystal castle, and with sorrow
and fear he thinks on the young Count Hermann, seduced by the
Nymph.&quot;
Here is the music, and the German words by Heinrich Heine.
This song has been a favorite in Germany for forty years,
and will remain a favorite always, maybe.&gt;&gt;

&gt; In response, you can say, and apparently are saying,
&gt;&quot;What about the case of Mark Twain?&quot;, an oft-used argument
&gt; in this group.

&gt; To which I would answer, the name Mark Twain on the
&gt; title page of a book (say &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;), **by itself**, is
&gt; evidence that the book was written by someone named Mark
&gt; Twain.

&gt; As it happens, however, this piece of evidence, in
&gt; this particular instance, is negated or invalidated by other

It works this way. We don't have the life and time to
investigate everything in the phenomenal world and
validate it so we take it at face value until it is called
into question.

If no one ever questions 'Mark Twain's' authorship
then it stands for all time. The problem with 'Tom Sawyer'
is that it's an outstanding piece of literature so questions
raised about the identity of 'Mark Twain' would never
settle down until the authorship was resolved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now I have to admit that while I 'know'
&gt; that 'Mark Twain' was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens, I'm
&gt; uncertain what specific documents exist that tell us this.

"/>

I don't think Clemens ever hid his identity. He just
liked the name 'Mark Twain.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I'm quite certain that such documents exist, whether
&gt; they be legal documents, or written notes from Clemens or
&gt; his publishers, or whatever. I will also go out on a limb
&gt; and say (without knowing for certain) that similar
&gt; documentary evidence exists for the other authors mentioned
&gt; in the above snipped passage of your quote. If I'm wrong,
&gt; I'm sure you'll tell me.

"/>

I think the scholarship on those authors is pretty much
settled.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If so, then in those *specific* cases the evidence
&gt; of the name on the title page has been negated or
&gt; invalidated by other pieces of evidence.

"/>

I think the way it usually worked is that a writer
would take a pen name but those in his or her literary
circle would be aware of that fact. George Sand
and George Eliot, for example, had other writers
writing about them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The problem for you in the case of Shakespeare, as
&gt; you well know, is that no similar documentary evidence
&gt; exists that negates or invalidates the name on the title
&gt; page.

"/>

That's the Strat problem, not mine. The Strats are making
the claim so the Strats have a burden of proof to show
evidence and witnesses to back up their claim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore, the name 'William Shakespeare' on the
&gt; title page continues to stand as evidence that the work was
&gt; written by someone with the name William Shakespeare.

"/>

Names on title pages are only assertions until a credible
witness converts them to fact. In terms of evidence,
'William Shakespeare' printed on Hamlet, as it now
stands, is open to question. The Oxfordians, who are
very good at public relations--which I think is very bad
for scholarship--have spread doubt very effectively so
the Stratford actor's authorship is no longer a given.

&gt;&gt; It was Andrew Gurr that Nelson was ripping. Gurr's chapter in
&gt; *Shakespeare's Face* does contain an unfortunate number of
&gt; errors, but they were mostly casual errors that suggest hasty
&gt; writing, rather than major gaffes. For example, Gurr said in
&gt; the chapter that Shakespeare received no salary as a Groom

Yes, of course. Thank you, David. As I recall, it was quite a vicious
rip that went on for some time. I don't remember much about it except
my surprise that Nelson would savage a fellow Stratfordian that way.
Of course, I congratulated him afterwards, shook his hand, and said he
did a much better job of talking about Gurr--I recall that's who it
was now--than talking about Oxford.

It's interesting that when a Stratfordian makes mistakes, even if
there are &quot;an unfortunate number of errors,&quot; you (and others, I
imagine) call them &quot;hasty writing, rather than major gaffes.&quot; (Alan
clearly thought they *were* major gaffes.) But when an Oxfordian makes
even a single mistake, it is somehow always egregious, held up to the
light, twisted around, and examined, like a colourful prism, over and
over again.

Best wishes,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well. Finally we have something that resembles a substantive point, as thin
&gt;&gt;&gt; as it is. At least it is not a generic call to politeness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People who might only have been able to sign their names might not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been able to read at all. They could have been taught to sign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their name at home (doubtful in Shakespeare's case) or by someone they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knew who was at least somewhat literate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;People who might&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;might not have been able to read&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;could have been taught&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; These are strange reactions from a person who, on another thread, says,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; also alarmed at the number of books on Shakespeare of Stratford that employ
&gt;&gt;&gt; the terms 'could have, should
&gt;&gt;&gt; have, would have.'&quot;

&gt;&gt; Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote
&gt;&gt; the canon.

&gt; I believe that you are confusing biography (which is perforce
&gt; speculative) with literary attribution here.

&gt; By analogy, there is abundant evidence that one Lynne Kositsky wrote
&gt; _A Question of Will_, _Rebecca's Flame_, _Candles_, and several other
&gt; highly regarded works of fiction. The evidence is robust enough that I
&gt; have no reason to question the attribution, and indeed I would be
&gt; foolhardy to do so. True, I have never seen the grammar school records
&gt; attesting that the abovementioned Lynne Kositsky is literate -- indeed,
&gt; I doubt that I could gain access to those records even if I tried -- yet
&gt; I certainly do not doubt for a moment the literacy of Ms. Kositksy.

&gt; I cannot with any certainty reconstruct her educational trajectory --
&gt; she may have been educated in England, in Canada, or elsewhere, in
&gt; public schools or private institutions, or she might even have been home
&gt; schooled. Thus any biographical reconstruction I could undertake would
&gt; perforce be mere speculation, and I would label it as such. I would
&gt; conjecture that Ms. Kositsky was educated for the most part in England
&gt; -- indeed, her writing contains occasional locutions that one would not
&gt; find in the speech of someone whose formative years had been spent in
&gt; Canada or in the U.S. I have read that she has spent time as an
&gt; educator, so I presume that as a prerequisite for that profession she
&gt; must have had some training and very probably a degree in education, but
&gt; I cannot say so with certainty, as I have not seen her diplomas.
&gt; Nevertheless, in view of her documented career trajectory, it is a
&gt; REASONABLE assumption that she has a degree in education. Thus, while I
&gt; am certain that Ms. Kositsky is literate -- indeed, far more than
&gt; literate: articulate, in fact -- I cannot reconstruct the details of her
&gt; education. Therefore I find nothing incompatible in being virtually
&gt; certaint about Shakespeare's literacy, yet being uncertain about the
&gt; detailed means by which he attained that proficiency.

&gt; If I thought like an Oxfordian (Ne dai mne Bog soiti s uma, as
&gt; Pushkin wrote), I might be perplexed concerning the apparent
&gt; incongruities between Ms. Kositsky's art and the few scraps of
&gt; biographical information that I possess about her. For example, Ms.
&gt; Kositsky has published works in the Our Canadian Girl Series -- how did
&gt; Ms. Kositsky acquire such unerring insight into Canadian girlhood as to
&gt; permit the composition of a virtual _Bildunsroman_ when by all
&gt; indications Ms. Kositsky herself grew up in a very different culture on
&gt; a different continent a vast ocean away -- indeed, in a country many of
&gt; whose denizens know no more about life in Canada than they do about life
&gt; in Pakistan, say? Ms. Kositsky has also written fiction concerning the
&gt; Holocaust, yet by reason of age alone Ms. Kositsky plainly cannot have
&gt; had direct personal experience of that unthinkable ordeal. The topic of
&gt; the Shoah is not one on which an author can afford to hit even a single
&gt; false note, both in deference to the memory of the victims and by virtue
&gt; of the importance of the collective memory of the culture, yet Ms.
&gt; Kositsky's versimilitude is evidently so highly regarded that she was
&gt; awarded multiple grants to facilitate its composition. How does she do
&gt; it? Finally, Ms. Kositsky has written or is writing another work
&gt; concerning the Acadians of Nova Scotia, another milieu in which she has
&gt; no direct experience, but which one expects her to reconstruct
&gt; imaginatively and convincingly. Plainly -- at least to an Oxfordian --
&gt; this glaring mismatch between literary canon and biography must raise
&gt; serious questions. Could &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot; be a pseudonym for a widely
&gt; traveled aristocrat? Could the real Lynne Kositsky be an illiterate or
&gt; scarcely literate &quot;front&quot; for someone who is precluded by virtue of his
&gt; station from a pursuit as frivolous as the composition of children's
&gt; literature?

Oh, David, you guessed. And the true author managed to keep it a
secret for such a long time. He will be so annoyed with me. He can't
be seen to be writing kidlit because he writes the scripts for porno

&gt;Dark, disturbing thoughts, as Charles Kinbote would say.

&gt; Fortunately, however, I do not think like an Oxfordian. I have no
&gt; doubt about Lynne Kositsky's literacy, however patchy, speculative, and
&gt; incomplete my conjectural reconstruction of her education may be. Nor
&gt; do I require documentary proof of her education (transcripts, diplomas,
&gt; employment records, etc.) to convince me that Lynne Kositsky is indeed
&gt; the author of the highly regarded literary works attributed to Lynne
&gt; Kositsky, and that she is therefore literate.

&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to prove anything, just showing, in fact,
&gt;&gt; that there is no proof of anything in this case. I'm surprised you
&gt;&gt; can't tell the difference.

I knew I shouldn't have given you the url to my website.

Actually, you're very, very funny, hysterical in fact, but you have
had to deduce little. My bio says where I spent my formative years.
Even if it didn't, you would find the strange locutions that are in my
posts in my novels--unless the editors have been remarkably successful
in eradicating them, which is not usually the case. The quite
astounding list of my education and degrees and grants and awards &lt;g&gt;
is also available on my website. I can send you transcripts of my
university credits if you like, and even copies of BA and MA diplomas,
just so you can be absolutely sure I am that I am (some days I'm not
even certain myself). My bio also says I have a degree in education.
You must have seen that if you read that I was a teacher.

There is a very good fit between the subjects I choose and my
biography.

1. As an ex-teacher, I write for young adults.

2. I am qualified to write four books in the *Our Canadian Girl*
series because my father was Canadian and I was born in Canada and
returned as an adult.

3. As a Jew, I tend to write about protagonists who have been
downtrodden in one way or another: the Catholic Irish, the Acadians,
the Indians of Haida Gwai, ex-slaves after the American Revolution,
and of course the children of the Holocaust. My poetry (for adults)
explores similar themes. I have had enough education to research and
write on these topics, but it would be surprising to see a book which
is in Latin or Greek, or uses research from these languages, under my
name. That's because I didn't learn either language in school.

4. *A Question of Will* is easily explained by the fact that I am an
Oxfordian, and many of my pursuits and the offices I hold attest to
this.

5. My next book out, *The Thought of High Windows*, is about the
Holocaust and contains some thinly veiled portraits of acquaintances.
I am not an earl of the realm, so they may sue. There are other bits
of autobiography in my books. Two dear dogs called Angel and Jessie
are in *Candles.* They were my beloved golden retrievers, much missed.

Hope this helps you to see a little more clearly the connection
between biography and literary production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom, when are you going to accept that Anti-Stratfordianism is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rational belief system?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Steese:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, that's precisely the problem with

"/>

Anti-Stratfordianism:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a rational belief system. Like all rational belief systems,
it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor orderly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Reedy:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, paranoid schizophrenia is also extremely rational and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; once the underlying belief system has been identified.

&gt; Petzold:

&gt;&gt;&gt; That doesn't even make sense. Paranoid schizophrenia is the result of
&gt;&gt;&gt; organic imbalances in the brain. You think it's governed by some
&gt;&gt;&gt; belief system? Belief systems may be conceived and followed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; schizophrenic mind with a great degree of rational consistency, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; not for long. Not when the context of the schizophrenic's life, as it
&gt;&gt;&gt; almost certainly would be, is known. For example, I once knew a man
&gt;&gt;&gt; who lived his whole life in campus coffeehouses, singing and playing
&gt;&gt;&gt; guitar, bumming cigarettes and change, stinking, being a goddamned
&gt;&gt;&gt; genius. His name was Keith. Keith explained how the U.S. Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a fine demonstration of Newtonian mechanics, with all its checks
&gt;&gt;&gt; and balances and proportionalism. Schizophrenic? I would guess so. And
&gt;&gt;&gt; I won't say it doesn't matter.

&gt;&gt; Your response has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.

&gt; Sure it does. You said that paranoid schizophrenia has an UNDERLYING
&gt; belief system and I said you weren't making any sense. Belief systems
&gt; are adjunct to the organic brain. Do you understand now?

"/>

I think I understand. Or maybe I don't.

Perhaps what I should have said was, &quot;Interestingly, those stricken with
paranoid schizophrenia hold belief systems that are extremely rational and
logical once the underlying system has been identified.&quot;

Similarly, to be strictly correct, Mark should not have referred to belief
systems as capable of action. Instead of saying, &quot;Like all rational belief
systems, it seeks to impose reason and order on something that is neither
reasonable nor orderly,&quot; he should have said, &quot;Like all those who hold
rational belief systems, they seek to impose . . . &quot;

Or am I still misunderstanding?

You also said

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that schizophrenia is &quot;extremely rational and logical,&quot; but that is
&gt; only superficially true. As I added, it loses that consistency when
&gt; you come to know the context of the sufferer's life. So, contrary to
&gt; your claim, my response was appropriate on both counts.

"/>

Again, a disease is obviously incapable of rationality or logic, and I
misspoke. Perhaps Janice was tryoing to make the same point. Someday I'll
re-read the exchange and see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Try this. Isolate a sentence you wrote, for example, &quot;You think it's
&gt;&gt; governed by some belief system?&quot; Then take a look at what I wrote and
&gt;&gt; isolate the part you think prompted your response. Compare the two and
see
&gt;&gt; if you can spot the differences.

&gt; Your condescension would have been more effective if you had been
&gt; right in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem, as with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-stratfordianism, is that the underlying assumptions are false.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I say Shakspere was a front-man for a small group of well-placed
&gt;&gt;&gt; ghostwriters, how can you deny that?

&gt;&gt; The same way you can assert it with no evidence whatsoever.

&gt; But Shakspere evinces no qualifications for having written what is
&gt; credited to him. No evidence of schooling besides inference. No
&gt; evidence of literacy besides a handful of wildly variable signatures
&gt; and the supposition that the roles he acted in required more than
&gt; memorization of his lines (a common trick of the functionally
&gt; illiterate). No evidence of intellectual stimulation except the
&gt; hot-and-cold and ambiguous testimony of Ben Jonson. No books, papers,
&gt; or letters worth mentioning. No college, travels, or any provable
&gt; contact with the nobility, the long poem dedications notwithstanding.
&gt; See, you KNOW all this stuff. He's lacking something that he
&gt; shouldn't.

"/>

Instead of getting into a useless barking match with you, I refer you to
Terry's responses to Lynne under this same heading.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't deny that he was an actor
&gt;&gt;&gt; and that he was a shareholder, so how can you DENY that such a person

&gt;&gt;&gt; front?

&gt;&gt; Why sure! It happens in comic books all the time so it must be true in
real
&gt;&gt; life also, right?

&gt; Just admit that your Shakespeare is too boring to live.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying that it is absolutely impossible that some
&gt;&gt;&gt; direct and affirmative evidence of such an arrangement would NOT have
&gt;&gt;&gt; survived?

&gt;&gt; Are you saying that's a sentence?

&gt; You're right. That sentence sucked. I rephrased it in mid-stream. I
&gt; meant to ask something more like why should you expect there to be
&gt; direct evidence of Shakspere's fronting after so long a time when such
&gt; an arrangement would have been oral and under the table, anyway.

"/>

Watch it! This is a family newsgroup!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, that's irrational. Secret arrangements are usually
&gt;&gt;&gt; orally made, right?

&gt;&gt; Especially in comic books, adventure novels and movies, yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should I expect to see some document outlining
&gt;&gt;&gt; his role as a front? That's irrational. And, yet, it is perfectly
&gt;&gt;&gt; rational to expect that a man of letters should have left behind some
&gt;&gt;&gt; stronger trace of his literary life than did Shakspere, but where are
&gt;&gt;&gt; those pieces of evidence?

&gt;&gt; Let's see, there's the First Folio. Does that count as a trace of a
literary
&gt;&gt; life?

&gt; Certainly. But the FF was no production of Shakspere's. Says so right
&gt; on the box. Others had to step in to save &quot;his&quot; works from oblivion.
&gt; Of course, no one thought of plays as literature and here we go round
&gt; the flagpole blah blah blah... See, these things always fly in the
&gt; face or rational understanding. He cared to create great plays for the
&gt; benefit of bear-baiters and prostitutes, but was far and away the most
&gt; pirated playwright of his time. He could squeeze blood out of a
&gt; turnip, but let go the reins of his own masterpieces to unscrupulous
&gt; printers. Do a cost-benefit analysis. Why should this real estate
&gt; speculator bother to write such beautiful lines in plays that could
&gt; not have been staged uncut?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You and Kathman and whoever else can cluck
&gt;&gt;&gt; and chirp all you want about what should and should not be expected
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a man of that station and time, but I just want a piece of
&gt;&gt;&gt; manuscript. A single fucking letter. A dog-eared book. Oh, well...back
&gt;&gt;&gt; to stew in my irrationality.

&gt;&gt; Nobody's stopped you yet. Stew away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It was because of such rational belief systems that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mankind stood staring at nature for thousands of years without
having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the least understanding of how it worked; it took Darwin, a man
who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to put the actual evidence of the world above his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preconceptions, to come up with the first accurate description of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's something wrong with your analogy, Mark, but I'm not smart
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough to say what it is.

&gt;&gt; I think what's wrong with his analogy is that evolution is rational.

&gt; I'm not sure I agree with that. Nature is said to be full of
&gt; superfluities and flaws.

&gt;&gt; Darwin
&gt;&gt; and Marx were the two supreme rationalists of the 19th century.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, prehistoric man DID know a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt; about how Nature worked, even if it wasn't at a level of theoretical
&gt;&gt;&gt; sophistication with natural selection. But even rational (or,
&gt;&gt;&gt; empirical) good sense can divine why square pegs don't go in round
&gt;&gt;&gt; holes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the Pro-Stratfordians who post here at hlas are unlikely
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acknowledge the essentially rational nature of

&gt;&gt; didn't refer to Shakespeare writing the canon.

&gt; A few lines previously, you had quoted your own use of the word &quot;case,&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument that reading was taught before writing doesn't wash.
&gt;&gt;&gt; People who might only have been able to sign their names might not

"/>

Actually I was referring to anyone of the time. And I meant people who
might only have been able to sign their names and *had no other
evidence of education.*

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Shakespeare seems to be the special &quot;case&quot; for whom antistratfordians
&gt; require special interpretive rules. What is the evidence that Shakespeare
&gt;&quot;might only have been able to sign his name&quot;? Marlowe left only a single
&gt; signature (without even a &quot;by me&quot;), but you don't seem to think of him as
&gt; someone who &quot;might only have been able to sign his name&quot; -- but Marlowe, I
&gt; suppose, is a different &quot;case.&quot;

"/>

Where is the evidence that Shakespeare could do more than sign his
name? Please don't tell me it's in his literary output. Marlowe *is* a
different case. I have no doubt he wrote the works attributed to him.
His biography fits his literary career.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Here is an earlier instance of your use of &quot;proof&quot; in the same thread:

&gt;&gt;&gt; We cannot say absolutely that Shakespeare did or did not have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; grammar school education until some kind of proof turns up by way of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; list of attendees. To my understanding, no such list exists.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether a grammar school education--which he may or may not have
&gt;&gt;&gt; had--would fit him to be the writer of the canon is another matter
&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely.

&gt; We have no &quot;list of attenders&quot; for Ben Jonson. We have no such list for
&gt; George Chapman. We have no such list for Michael Drayton. We have no
&gt; such list for John Webster, or Thomas Dekker, or Cyril Tourneur. There
&gt; is, therefore, no &quot;proof&quot; that any of these men had even a grammar school
&gt; education -- to say nothing of whether a grammar school education would
&gt; have fit them to write the works attributed to them. Shakespeare,
&gt; however, is not classed with them by antistratfordians; Shakespeare is a
&gt; special &quot;case.&quot;

"/>

Nonsense, he's not a special case. It's not just that he might not
have gone to school. The facts we know about him, imo, do not seem to
fit the writings in the canon. I have to say I might be just a tiny
bit dubious of Webster too. Just the teeniest, tiniest bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It referred back to a previous post, the gist of which was that if we
&gt;&gt; have evidence that someone in Tudor Times could sign his name, but we
&gt;&gt; have no other writing samples from him, it is impossible in the absolute
&gt;&gt; sense to know whether he could write more than that or whether he could
&gt;&gt; read.

&gt; Like the possibly illiterate Christopher Marlowe -- it is &quot;impossible in
&gt; the absolute sense to know whether he could write more than that or
&gt; whether he could read.&quot;

"/>

He went to university, therefore one assumes he could read. The
problem with Shakespeare is that we have no record of his schooling,
he did not go to university, we have no samples of his writing except
the dubious More fragment, his interests did not seem to be a good fit
with the canon, and any contemporary material written about him,
including the new Roscius annotation, suggests he was an actor, but
says nothing about his being a poet or playwright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I do, however, (for at least the fourth time) believe that Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; of Stratford could probably read as he was an actor.

&gt; Alas, Marlowe was not an actor.

"/>

Alas, Marlowe didn't have to be. He had the great Alleyn to act for
him. And there is other evidence that suggests he could both read and
write.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think you know me better than to suggest I would say there is &quot;no
&gt;&gt; proof of anything&quot; as regards the authorship question.

&gt; I know you are not of the Sobran/Brame-Popova &quot;Oxford wrote everything&quot;
&gt; school,&quot; so I think there MUST be Elizabethan attributions (other than to
&gt; Oxford), that you accept -- but I do not know which ones. I should think
&gt; you probably accept Sidney's authorship of *Astrophil &amp; Stella* and
&gt; Spenser's of *The Shepheardes Calender* (I was not picking particularly
&gt; tough cases), but I would be relieved to hear you confirm that you do.

"/>

I think that whoever Shakespeare was, he probably had quite enough to
do writing the canon. It looks like he needed a bit of help with that
too, as there appears to be evidence of more than one writer in some
of the plays. He may have worked with someone, or perhaps another
writer finished his work after his death.

Yessuh, I accept other attributions. But it is my prerogative to
change my mind in the future.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your point is that nobody can ever offer &quot;proof&quot; of anything, or that
&gt;&gt;&gt; no Elizabethan attribution meets your standards of &quot;proof,&quot; then the &quot;no
&gt;&gt;&gt; proof of anything in this case&quot; claim is misleading, as it suggests that
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is something peculiar about &quot;this case.&quot; If, on the other hand, you
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that most, or at least some of the generally accepted attributions
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Elizabethan works are based on &quot;proof,&quot; then perhaps you tell us about
&gt;&gt;&gt; a few of those cases, so we will know what you mean by &quot;proof&quot; in this
&gt;&gt;&gt; context.

"/>

Yes, I'll be glad to, Terry, when I have a little more time and am a
little less tired. I have little doubt, for example, that Jonson wrote
the work attributed to him. Everything fits and he was a well-known
literary figure. I've no problem with Marlowe for the same reason. How
many authors would you like me to give? I cannot say with absolute one
hundred per cent proof that anyone wrote the work attributed to him,
as I've just been shaken to my shoes to find out one modern Canadian
children's writer was someone else entirely who was using a pseudonym.
But in general, the people I would accept would be those

1) Who can be shown to be educated *in some way*
2) Whose education is a fit with their literary production
3) Who are spoken about as authors by some or many others
4) Who write from a pov which is not incongruous with their upbringing
5) Who show *in some way* some evidence of their life in their work
6) Who seem to live a life which is in keeping with the philosophy of
their writing
7) Who would appear to have access to all the source material.

Clearly, not every point can be satisfied in every instance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Again, please see my answer above. You're way off base. As Stephen
&gt;&gt; Leacock once said of one of his characters, Lord Ronald: &quot;He flung
&gt;&gt; himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.&quot;

&gt; He must have ridden with Bedford Forrest.

"/>

I think Lord Ronald had enough trouble riding with himself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there some reason why the attributions of Shakespeare's works should
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT be decided using criteria that could be applied to works by other
&gt;&gt;&gt; authors?

&gt;&gt; Of course not.

&gt; So can you tell me whether you accept Spenser's authorship of *The
&gt; Shepheardes Calender* or Sidney's of *Astrophil and Stella*? If so, can
&gt; you tell us why? If not, can you tell us whether there are any
&gt; Elizabethan attributions that you do accept?

"/>

Yes, I believe I do, although I haven't studied either closely and
cannot in any way be said to be an expert on either. So my accepting
them might not mean much. But I hope you feel relieved now. I do so
hate you to be anxious. The difference between Shakespeare and many
other writers of the time is that he is still so famous today that
some of us have examined him much more minutely than we have others.
It is quite possible that one or two others were fronts, or that some
true authors had their works stolen by play-brokers. There seem to be
references to this in the literature of the time.

You'll have to forgive me. Even when I'm at my best you can run rings
around me. And at the moment it's 1.30, I've been standing in the
freezing cold at a vigil most of the evening, I'm probably making no
sense at all (that's for sure, say the strats), and I must get some
rest.

My favorite recent example of &quot;phony authorship&quot; is the claim by Brame and
Popova that Oxford was not merely Shakespeare, Gascoigne, Turberville,
Googe (does this help their case?), and many others, but even Thomas
Phaer: &quot;by age eight de Vere had translated seven books of Virgil's
*Aeneid*, which were published in 1558 under the *Phaer* pseudonym&quot;
(*Shakespeare's Fingerprints*, 463).

The mystery for me is why they credit Oxford with nothing published before
1558 -- in fact, why they do not credit Oxford with having written works
published centuries before he was born, since his &quot;fingerprints&quot; may be
found in just about any work ever written. Had they looked in Virgil's
original they would have found hundreds of such &quot;fingerprints&quot; as words
containing the strings &quot;[uv]er&quot; and &quot;fer.&quot; In fact, they do comment on
the fact that Virgil's name &quot;is itself a *ver*-word&quot; (464) -- but they
lack the imagination to draw the obvious conclusion that Oxford WAS
Virgil.

&gt; the writings of two of the funniest Baconian CRANKS of all time:
&gt; Ignatius Donnelly and the MAD Elizabeth Wells Gallup.&gt;&gt;
&gt; - _Who Was Shakespeare?_ (1992) by Martin Gardner

&gt;&lt;&lt;Ignatius Donnelly, used a system even more farfetched for his 1,000
&gt; page CRANK work _The Great Cryptogram_ (1888). This tome and Donnelly's
&gt; _Atlantis_ and _Ragnarok_ form the most impressive set of CRACKPOT works
&gt; written by an American before 1900. It remained for Mrs. Elizabeth Wells
&gt; Gallup (1846-1934), to apply Bacon's cipher to Shakespeare's plays,
&gt; producing the best and most hilarious plaintexts in the history of
&gt; Baconiana. Like Donnelly, Mrs. Gallup is a splendid specimen of the
&gt; intelligent learned, honest and THOROUGHLY SELF-DELUDED CRANK. . .

&gt; Yowrs in all kyndenes,

Greg, I don't participate in dialogue with anyone who treats me as a
hostile witness so you should know that (this response is a courtesy
so that you aren't disappointed by non response in the future). Nor
have I ever claimed to be an expert or a scholar. I leave that to the
experts and the scholars. That I choose one group over another is
allowable, I believe (it is incredible to me that if I'm honest enough
to say I don't know something, or have forgotten it for the minute, it
appears to be occasion for jubilation and ridicule). And since I
appear to be the only Oxfordian female on these boards, even if I
wrote 24 hours a day in response to the Stratfordian men who are
writing (to put it kindly), to me, I would still have material to
catch up on. But thanks.

I did put your questions up on our discussion board. I have several
responses. I can pass them on to you privately if you don't publish
them. But there was actually no time in Carmel to do anything other
than attend lectures, panel discussions, and plays. I had
underestimated the fact that everyone tends to go overtime, at a
conference one is always on the run, and my running ain't so good
nowadays. As a particularly sensitive friend informed me, my illness
has slowed me down. But the responses I received on the boards (before
Carmel) led me to think anyhow that any responses you would get would
just be fodder for you to treat their authors as &quot;hostile witnesses.&quot;

I have nothing against William Shakespeare of Stratford. I am reminded
of *Beyond the Fringe* in which Peter Cook says to Dudley Moore, who
is playing a one-legged man auditioning for the role of Tarzan: &quot;I got
nothing against your right leg. The trouble is, neither have you.&quot; If
Oxford is found to my satisfaction to have no legs at all, and if no
two-legged authorship hopefuls turn up in the next few years, I'll be
glad to consider a &quot;uni-dexter&quot; such as William.

I'm answering two of you at once because I can't get into the other

Well, since you keep answering for me, there's probably no need for me
to respond. However, I feel I must say this: if someone writes one
book or one play or one novel, it's probably very difficult to see if
the philosophy of his or her writing conforms to his or her life in
any way. But when we have a body of work, a pattern usually emerges.

Do you know how few books there were? Do you know how expensive and
sometimes inaccessible they were? Do you know how many of them were
written in languages other than English? Do you recognise that some of
the sources might still have been in manuscript and therefore
available to very few people indeed? If you're going to argue, at
least do so with some wit. There's no point in shooting down my points
with vague statements. Especially when that's what you accuse me of.

And please stop ganging up on me, guys. You keep asking me questions--
interrogating me?--I am polite enough to respond, and you all go for

At the moment, however, both my memory and my energy are somewhat

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . . .(N)ontheless, I agree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that an authentic manuscript in Shakespeare's hand is better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence than a name on a title page. But the name 'William
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare' on the title page is, by itself, still evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the work was written by someone named William
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is from a US Supreme Court case, McIntryre v. Ohio
&gt;&gt;&gt;Elections Commission. Something about a Mrs. McIntyre
&gt;&gt;&gt;who distributed anonymous leaflets which violated Ohio State
&gt;&gt;&gt;laws that political material must be signed. The lawyer, who
&gt;&gt;&gt;nicely annotated his writ, is apparently an Oxfordian:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 American names such as Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne
&gt;&gt;&gt; Clemens) and O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) come
&gt;&gt;&gt; readily to mind. Benjamin Franklin employed numerous
&gt;&gt;&gt; different pseudonyms. See 2 W. C. Bruce, Benjamin
&gt;&gt;&gt; Franklin Self Revealed: A Biographical and Critical
&gt;&gt;&gt; Study Based Mainly on His Own Writings, ch. 5 (2d ed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1923). Distinguished French authors such as Voltaire
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Francois Marie Arouet) and George Sand (Amandine Aurore
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lucie Dupin), and British authors such as George Eliot
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Mary Ann Evans), Charles Lamb (sometimes wrote as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Elia&quot;), and Charles Dickens (sometimes wrote as &quot;Boz&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; , also published under assumed names.
&gt;&gt; SNIP

&gt;&gt; I think the examples listed demonstrate an important
&gt;&gt; point, Elizabeth.

&gt;&gt; Any piece of evidence can be negated or invalidated
&gt;&gt; by some other piece of evidence.

&gt;&gt; As I've repeatedly said, I think the name 'William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare' on the title page of a work, by itself, is
&gt;&gt; evidence that someone named William Shakespeare wrote the
&gt;&gt; work.

&gt;&gt; In response, you can say, and apparently are saying,
&gt;&gt;&quot;What about the case of Mark Twain?&quot;, an oft-used argument
&gt;&gt; in this group.

&gt;&gt; To which I would answer, the name Mark Twain on the
&gt;&gt; title page of a book (say &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;), **by itself**, is
&gt;&gt; evidence that the book was written by someone named Mark
&gt;&gt; Twain.

&gt;&gt; As it happens, however, this piece of evidence, in
&gt;&gt; this particular instance, is negated or invalidated by other
&gt;&gt; pieces of evidence.

&gt;It works this way. We don't have the life and time to
&gt;investigate everything in the phenomenal world and
&gt;validate it so we take it at face value until it is called
&gt;into question.

&gt;If no one ever questions 'Mark Twain's' authorship
&gt;then it stands for all time. The problem with 'Tom Sawyer'
&gt;is that it's an outstanding piece of literature so questions
&gt;raised about the identity of 'Mark Twain' would never
&gt;settle down until the authorship was resolved.

"/>

Okay.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now I have to admit that while I 'know'
&gt;&gt; that 'Mark Twain' was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens, I'm
&gt;&gt; uncertain what specific documents exist that tell us this.

&gt;I don't think Clemens ever hid his identity. He just
&gt;liked the name 'Mark Twain.'

&gt;&gt; But I'm quite certain that such documents exist, whether
&gt;&gt; they be legal documents, or written notes from Clemens or
&gt;&gt; his publishers, or whatever. I will also go out on a limb
&gt;&gt; and say (without knowing for certain) that similar
&gt;&gt; documentary evidence exists for the other authors mentioned
&gt;&gt; in the above snipped passage of your quote. If I'm wrong,
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you'll tell me.

&gt;I think the scholarship on those authors is pretty much
&gt;settled.

"/>

Good. So we're agreed, *in those cases*, there
exists evidence that invalidates or negates the evidence of
the names on the title pages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If so, then in those *specific* cases the evidence
&gt;&gt; of the name on the title page has been negated or
&gt;&gt; invalidated by other pieces of evidence.

&gt;I think the way it usually worked is that a writer
&gt;would take a pen name but those in his or her literary
&gt;circle would be aware of that fact. George Sand
&gt;and George Eliot, for example, had other writers
&gt;writing about them.

"/>

But again, I am admittedly assuming that we have
documentary evidence for each of the authors you cited that
indicate that they did, in fact, write under a pen-name. If
I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The problem for you in the case of Shakespeare, as
&gt;&gt; you well know, is that no similar documentary evidence
&gt;&gt; exists that negates or invalidates the name on the title
&gt;&gt; page.

&gt;That's the Strat problem, not mine. The Strats are making
&gt;the claim so the Strats have a burden of proof to show
&gt;evidence and witnesses to back up their claim.

"/>

Certainly. And the first piece of *evidence* is
that the name 'William Shakespeare' appears on some of the
works. And that name on the work, by itself, is *evidence*
that the work was written by someone with the name William
Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Therefore, the name 'William Shakespeare' on the
&gt;&gt; title page continues to stand as evidence that the work was
&gt;&gt; written by someone with the name William Shakespeare.

&gt;Names on title pages are only assertions until a credible
&gt;witness converts them to fact.

"/>

I disagree. The name 'William Shakespeare' on the
title page, by itself, is evidence that the work was written
by someone with the name William Shakespeare. This piece of
evidence, like any piece of evidence, as in the cases you
cited, may be invalidated or negated by some other piece of
evidence. But until such invalidating evidence is found,
the name on the title page remains as evidence that the work
was written by someone with the name William Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In terms of evidence,
&gt;'William Shakespeare' printed on Hamlet, as it now
&gt;stands, is open to question.

"/>

In terms of evidence, 'William Shakespeare' printed
on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, by itself, is evidence that &quot;Hamlet&quot; was
written by someone with the name William Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Oxfordians, who are
&gt;very good at public relations--which I think is very bad
&gt;for scholarship--have spread doubt very effectively so
&gt;the Stratford actor's authorship is no longer a given.

"/>

The Oxfordians seem to be good at providing
misleading arguments for gullible people. I've noticed that
some anti-Strats have a tendency to try to dismiss, far too
quickly, names on title pages as being of no importance.
They are wrong. Thus I have to belabour my point. And in
case I've haven't made my point clear: the name 'William
Shakespeare' on a title page, by itself, is evidence that
the work was written by someone with the name William
Shakespeare.

BTW: I'm still waiting to read your critique of the

&lt;&lt;&quot;The admirable Doctor&quot; Roger Bacon (1214-1294) is said to have created a

&lt;&lt;Robert Greene's &quot;Friar Bacon &amp; Friar Bungay&quot; (1594) was a play believed
to be derived from the prose pamphlet &quot;The Famous History of Friar Bacon&quot;,
and probably inspired by Marlowe's play &quot;Faust&quot; which hit the stage a year
earlier (1593). It tells the science-fictional story of how Friar Bacon,
and his adept-sidekick Bungay, constructed by magical means a BRASS head.
Bacon summons the Devil, who says that the head will speak within a month.
Bacon is exhausted from waiting and watching for three weeks, so he leaves
his servant Mickey Mouse -- whoops, no, that's &quot;Fantasia&quot; -- I mean Miles
to watch for him. The head finally speaks two words: &quot;Time is.&quot; Miles
doesn't think it's worth waking Friar Bacon. The head speaks again: &quot;Time
was.&quot; Then it concludes &quot;Time is past,&quot; falls, and breaks. Bacon awakes
too late, and berates Miles. &gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter LXI-LXII

&lt;&lt;Quixote lodges with a wealthy gentleman named Don Antonio Moreno, who
intends to play jokes on Quixote with care not to harm the knight. Don
Antonio and his friends enjoy Sancho's witty remarks, as well. Later that
night, Don Antonio speaks to Quixote privately, swearing him to secrecy. Don
Antonio tells Quixote that he has a bronze head that was created by a Polish
man who was &quot;one of the greatest enchanters and wizards the world ever had,&quot;
having been taught by the famous Escotillo. The head is mute on Fridays, but
on all other days, it answers every question asked to its ear. Quixote is
dressed and taken for a walk around town, but Don Antonio's men have pinned
a parchment to Quixote's back reading: &quot;This is Don Quixote de la Mancha.&quot;
Quixote marvels at how everyone who walks past him says out loud &quot;This is
Don Quixote de la Mancha.&quot; Returning to Don Antonio's home, Don Quixote is
the main amusement at a ball that is thrown by Don Antonio's wife. Don
Quixote dances for a time, but then he sits down on the floor in the center
of the dance hall. Sancho puts Quixote to bed.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The next morning, Don Antonio decides to experiment with the talking
enchanted head. Don Antonio has told two of his friends about the ruse and
they join him, along with Don Antonio's wife, two of her friends, Quixote
and Sancho Panza. The group is marveled by the head's ability to answer
various questions. The talking head is a machine of course, hollowed with an
inner pipe, through which a man in another room answers the questions he has
heard. Don Antonio keeps the head for a little more than a week, destroying
it before he comes under the suspicions of the Inquisition.

Walking around the town, Quixote sees a sign that says &quot;Here books are
printed,&quot; and so he enters. Quixote spends some time with a translator. The
printers are correcting a version of the Second Part of the Ingenious
Gentleman Don Quixote de la Mancha, written by an inhabitant of Tordesillas.
Quixote says that he is surprised that the book has not already been burned
for its impertinence.&gt;&gt;

&quot;What answer wouldst thou have, beast?&quot; said Don Quixote; &quot;is it not enough
that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is enough,&quot; said Sancho; &quot;but I should have liked it to have made
itself plainer and told me more.&quot;

The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with which
all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in the secret.
This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to keep the
world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange magical mystery
in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another head, the work of an
image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at home
for his own amusement and to astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism was
as follows. The table was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper,
and the pedestal on which it stood was of the same material, with four
eagles' claws projecting from it to support the weight more steadily. The
head, which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured
like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was
fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of
the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the
head, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath the
chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the pedestal,
table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin
carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room below corresponding
to the one above was placed the person who was to answer, with his mouth to
the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards,
and from below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was
impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio's, a smart
sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he had been told beforehand
by his uncle who the persons were that would come with him that day into the
chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the
first question at once and correctly; the others he answered by guess-work,
and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous
contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became noised
abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchanted head that
answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come
to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to
the inquisitors, who commanded him to break it up and have done with it,
lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and
by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of
answering questions, though more to Don Quixote's satisfaction than
Sancho's.

&gt; restaurant that serves two dishes: Frog ala Peche, and Peche ala Frog.
&gt; (This was part of their show *Good Evening*, which also included the
&gt; unidexter Tarzan routine, and others so funny that my head hurt for days).

"/>

I used to love *Good Evening*, but I guess I missed the one you're
talking about. It does remind me, however, of an episode of Fawlty
Towers, where there was only duck on the menu. Duck a l'Orange, Duck
Surprise (rather a frightening choice, I thought) and just Duck. I
think Cleese's humour (and that of the Python gang in general) is an
offshoot of Dud and Pete's and their two co-conspirators at the
Edinburgh Festival. And I know what you mean. I would laugh my way
from hysteria to agony all the time when they were on tv. I think my
favourite was Pete, with a heavy cockney accent, talking of how he
couldn't be tempted: &quot;I would say, get out of my bed, Gina
Lollabrigida.&quot; I'm sorry both Dud and Pete are gone now.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, can't do justice to the way my mother mimicked that.

&gt; My grandmother (so my mother tells us) couldn't wait until the home poteen

&gt; and was delighted to find that my favorite scotch, which has become
&gt; extremely scarce in Baltimore, is still to be had in NY for ready money --
&gt; but this is NOT the kind of whisky to drink until one's head hurts for

Which scotch is that? My dad was something of a connoisseur of scotch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not according to me but according to Nashe - see above. Are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; quarrelling with an original source, Paul? You living in 21st century
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ireland are a greater authority on conditions in 16th century London
&gt;&gt;&gt; than a man living there?

&gt;&gt; Nashe was not engaged in presenting a flat
&gt;&gt; sociological report on the conditions of his
&gt;&gt; nation (such as would meet the standards of,
&gt;&gt; say, a 21st century Government investigation).
&gt;&gt; He was arguing a case, and pushing it to, and
&gt;&gt; beyond, all reasonable limits -- largely out of
&gt;&gt; a sense of fun. He was rarely 100% serious.
&gt;&gt; (Heck, he was rarely 20% serious!) I'm sure
&gt;&gt; he knew how bad his argument was. But if he
&gt;&gt; rushed on at a furious pace, no one would
&gt;&gt; notice -- after all, you didn't.

&gt; You know, when a post or two back you said 'I don't have Nashe', did
&gt; you mean you didn't have a copy of 'Pierce Penilesse' to hand? If so,
&gt; how is it that given a brief quote you are absolutely sure you can
&gt; interpret not only what the author *really* meant - according to you
&gt; the complete reverse of what he actually wrote - but also his motives
&gt; for writing it? This isn't so much literacy criticism as
&gt; clairvoyancy. It's fascinating. Do go on.

"/>

Your post is a nice try at avoiding all the
issues. You don't express disagreement
with anything I say. You don't express
agreement. You just waffle on and on.

Are you really claiming that we can rely
on Nashe for the plain reportage of facts?
Or did he often humorously modify or
'spin' them?

Or to put it another way: Is it advisable
to shut your brain down completely
when reading Nashe?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Secondly, he was addressing courtiers, and by
&gt;&gt; 'the vulgar sort' he meant the next layer down --
&gt;&gt; the literate, aspiring middle-classes who were,
&gt;&gt; in fact, often trying to 'improve their speech'.
&gt;&gt; Some of them were buying books and, maybe
&gt;&gt; sometimes, even reading poetry.

&gt; Why would Nashe - the son of a country parson - describe the middle
&gt; class as 'the vulgar sort'?

"/>

Because he knew nearly every literate
person of his day was a snob -- and
intensely anxious about his (or her)
social position, and he enjoyed playing
with their minds.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But the argument that poetry had 'made the
&gt;&gt; vulgar sort aspire to richer purity of speech'
&gt;&gt; is close to nonsense -- and IMO contained
&gt;&gt; about as much truth as it did in, say, the 1920s.

&gt; Paul, as you say, that's your opinion. Nashe differed.

"/>

Nashe pretended to differ. Note how
you don't seek to defend his 'opinion'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You can assert it's
&gt; nonsense, and mention the 1920s (why?), so that handily disposes of
&gt; contemporary testimony.

"/>

Note how you don't seek to defend his
'opinion' or quote anything to support him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I understand now why you don't bother with
&gt; research. There isn't much need for you to consult historical texts at
&gt; all, is there? You can just decide what you think probably happened,
&gt; and that's that. Must save a lot of time.

"/>

You do have to exercise your brain -- and
use some tiny bit of common sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The pressures to 'talk proper' came from other
&gt;&gt; directions. Only a relatively small number
&gt;&gt; could manage to 'speak like the Queen',
&gt;&gt; without getting pulled back down by their
&gt;&gt; family and friends.
&gt;&gt; Maybe he thought he could get away with
&gt;&gt; such an argument because the courtiers
&gt;&gt; knew little of the lives of the middle-classes.
&gt;&gt; But, as I said before, it was mainly an
&gt;&gt; exercise in rhetoric -- where the pace and
&gt;&gt; fluency of the prose deceives the eye.

&gt; It isn't the eye he'd need to deceive, is it? More the ear. According
&gt; to you his prose was so spellbinding he could persuade courtiers that
&gt; their tailors, shoemakers, clerks and jewellers were speaking the same
&gt; way they were, whereas in reality they were all dropping their aitches
&gt; or grunting inarticulately.

"/>

Nashe was arguing for the virtues of poetry
-- and how it enabled _some_ Londoners to
speak better. Who do you think these
people were? Did they exist at all? Where
do you get this nonsense about 'tailors,
shoemakers, clerks' . . . etc.? Courtiers knew
exactly how the lower classes spoke -- with
a strong London accent -- and also knew
how much poetry they read. (How much
poetry do you think modern shoe-menders
and clerks read -- on average?) The class
that Nashe was talking about were those who
_were_ doing their best to talk like courtiers . .
the 'new men' . . the lawyers, office-holders,
court officials, sons of richer merchants, who
pretended to like poetry (and some probably
did).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I always thought Nashe was a good writer,
&gt; but your opinion of him is off the scale.

"/>

Nashe was, to a large extent, taking the piss.
You're far from being his first victim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Very little in Nashe should be taken as the
&gt;&gt; straight reportage of facts.

&gt; And your evidence for that statement is..?

"/>

I'm sure you agree with it -- except when
you find that he's pulled you leg, 400 years
after having gone to the grave.

I don't know why Brame and Popova cling to the belief that Oxford was born
in 1550, when he left so many fingerprints in a work that was written more
than a millennium and a half before his supposed birth. Brame and Popova
say, &quot;it is high time that scholars cease their reflex responses of
'commonplace' every time a heretic cites a fingerprint going against the
grain of tradition&quot; (ii) -- yet these professed &quot;heretics&quot; have not even
looked at the fingerprints Oxford left long before the scholars would have
you believe he was born, and long after the scholars would have you
believe he died. Brame and Popova may reject the scholars judgments on
literature but they are slaves to the scholars' chronology.

Brame and Popova praise &quot;all courageous writers who have refused to be
intimidated&quot; (meaning themselves, presumably, and all other bold followers
of Looney) -- yet their own self-admiring courage is very limited indeed
if they are too cowardly to face the implications of their magnificent
discoveries. Their methods will demonstrate (for anyone brave and
imaginative enough) not only that Oxford wrote all Elizabethan literature,
but that Oxford wrote just about everything that has ever been written,
and that he WILL write everything that has not yet been written.
Oxford's fingerprints will be found (if anyone is fearless enough to
search for them) in books that will be written long after the current
generation of mortals has passed away.

Where is the work Oxford did NOT write? His fingerprints are all over
Chaucer and George Eliot; Catullus and H. G. Wells. If there is any merit
whatsoever in the fingerprint method, then Oxford has written everything,
and Brame and Popova should be stout-hearted and heretical enough to say
so.

&gt;&gt; By &quot;Oxfordian web sites,&quot; I did not mean ALL web sites owned by

&gt;&gt; mind the web sites actively promoting various forms of Oxfordian...uh...
&gt;&gt; eccentricity. Your site appears to be promoting your young adult
&gt;&gt; fiction, as one would expect, not drawing inferences about the
&gt;&gt; authorship of the Shakespeare canon from anagrams, ciphers,
&gt;&gt; consultations with a medium, speculations about Masonic conspiracies,

&gt;&gt; various anti-Stratfordians' takes on the Kennedy assassination, Percy
&gt;&gt; Allen's seances, Raeto West's views on virtually everything (from modern
&gt;&gt; physics to biology to the history of the Shoah) etc. as &quot;adventurous,&quot;
&gt;&gt; then one is applying the designation to much that manifestly crosses the
&gt;&gt; line from adventurousness into pure, unalloyed crankery.
&gt; The problem is that I'm new on here and therefore have no crankery to
&gt; throw back at you. So it's rather an unequal contest. I'm afraid I
&gt; can't take your word for it that there are no Strat cranks.

I have never asserted that there are NO &quot;Strat cranks&quot;; rather, I
have noted that comic crankery has an unnerving way of arising in
anti-Stratfordians context, including this forum. I have been reading
the newsgroup almost since its inception, and I cannot recall EVER
having seen any of the &quot;Stratfordians&quot; opine that the Apollo lunar
landing was faked, that he or she had solved Fermat's Last Theorem, that
AIDS is a hoax, that special relativity is wrong (and also that Einstein
plagiarized it), that Old English was still spoken in some shires until
the nineteenth century, that John Edward really does talk to dead
people, that the Bernoulli Principle is inapplicable to aviation, etc.
-- in fact, to my knowledge, no Stratfordian has ever even so much as
extolled aquatic apes in this forum. Moreover, I cannot recall ever
having seen anything even remotely comparable to these amusing avatars
of crankery in this forum from the usual Stratfordian suspects. I

&gt; A question: even if the pattern of the work shows that the ideas, plots,
&gt; etc., in it, are more congruent with the Earl of Oxford's point of view (as
&gt; we know it) than with the point of view of William Shakespeare of Stratford
&gt; on Avon -- even if this is the case, what conclusion can we draw? The idea
&gt; that a playwright was a &quot;front,&quot; as being discussed here, is the idea that
&gt; the playwright didn't write the plays at all, but that he got manuscripts
&gt; from the hand of the actual author (or the author's secretary or a courier
&gt; or whoever), entire. What is being proposed by &quot;Oxfordians,&quot; as I
&gt; understand it, is that Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays:
&gt; was the guiding mind behind their conception and also was wholly responsible
&gt; for their creation as sequences of lines of English verse and English prose
&gt; (arranged into speeches for characters, scenes, etc.). What is not being
&gt; proposed is that the playwright got material from someone else and wrote it
&gt; up, consciously, for that other person (who, presumably, paid him or made it
&gt; possible for him to work and acquire honors or did something else that made
&gt; this arrangement worth his while). Is this correct?

"/>

Some Oxfordians may propose something
along such lines. But they are wrong and
confused. Of course, none of us were there,
and the truth was not made public, so we are
all guessing. But some guesses are more
reasonable than others.

My own view is that the Stratman was
rarely in London; that he was not a
playwright (nor even literate) and had little
or nothing to do with the theatre. Most of
the VERY FEW records that indicate a
connection are manifestly false (e.g. his
listing as the top actor in Ben Jonson's plays)
and the others are IMO clearly contrived by
the authorities of the day.

The plays had generally been written a
decade or more earlier for court audiences
-- although the poet would have continued
revising some right up to his death in 1604.
Most were probably never performed for a
public audience before their publication.
Most would have had few public performances
-- so your questions are largely misconceived.

If Popova and Brame only had the nerve, they'd realize that Yip Harburg

&quot;*Original-Source Strategy*: If an author A living during Edward de Vere's

Edward de Vere&quot; (511).

P&amp;B's tragic flaw is their limiting Edward de Vere's lifetime to the dates
imposed by scholars, 1550-1604. Once we realize that Oxford is immortal
(and always has been), the conclusion that he was everybody -- including
Yip Harburg -- is inescapable. Harburg pilfers not merely imagery used by
de Vere (i.e. Shakespeare and other Elizabethans), he pilfers one of the
most famous of Elizabethan lines from one of the most famous Elizabethan
works:

When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind-a human
If I only had a heart.

I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows,
If I only had a heart.

Picture me ... a balcony ...
Above a voice sings low--
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat.
How sweet!

Just to register emotion.
&quot;Jealousy,&quot;&quot;devotion&quot;
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper
If I only had a heart.

Oxford's/Shakespeare's/Harburg's poetry is what keeps Oxford the Ancient
of Days &quot;young and chipper.&quot; He locked the secret of his immortality with
a zipper that Popova and Brame can't slide open because they haven't even
dusted it for fingerprints.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordians, a sample I have not even begun to survey. Rather, I had in
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind the web sites actively promoting various forms of Oxfordian...uh...
&gt;&gt;&gt; eccentricity. Your site appears to be promoting your young adult
&gt;&gt;&gt; fiction, as one would expect, not drawing inferences about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship of the Shakespeare canon from anagrams, ciphers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; consultations with a medium, speculations about Masonic conspiracies,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.

&gt;&gt; You should see my other website. ;)

&gt; By all means, post the URL and I'll be happy to take a look! :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Streitz is anomalous, and of course you know that,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the activities of Percy Allen? See, e.g.,

&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt; Briefly, Percy Allen, one of the more...uh...eccentric Oxfordians,
&gt; rewrote literary history by conducting séances and thereby making direct
&gt; contact with the pertinent Elizabethans. Next to Allen, Mr. Streitz
&gt; appears positively sane.

Next to my Strat teacher who also conducted seances, most Oxfordians

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whom do you have in mind? Can you be more specific?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, Rowse was rather peculiar, for starters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't recall ever hearing or reading ANYTHING about Rowse that was
&gt;&gt;&gt; anywhere near as peculiar as ANY of the above instances of what you
&gt;&gt;&gt; euphemistically characterize as adventurousness -- do you?

&gt;&gt; Maybe not adventurousness (there must be a better word), but
&gt;&gt; weirdness, certainly.

&gt; To repeat the question, I cannot recall ever having heard or read
&gt; ANYTHING about Rowse that could be construed as &quot;weirdness&quot; commensurate
&gt; with rejection of the Bernoulli Principle, with Percy Allen's séances,
&gt; with Stephanie Caruana's &quot;Gemstone&quot; conspiracy (or Art's benign Masonic
&gt; madness) or with Ken Kaplan's confident assurances that John Edward
&gt; really does talk to dead people -- can you? If you're going to argue
&gt; that Rowse's supposed weirdness was even remotely comparable to the
&gt; crankery of which I enumerated copious instances above, you will need to
&gt; be more specific and furnish some concrete examples.

O dear, we keep going back to Bernoulli, Gemstone, and John Edward,
etc. I keep snipping them above, but they keep growing back like
weeds. I don't really care to concentrate on the same people's
weaknesses over and over again. I will look up the material on some of
Rowse's weirdnesses if you really want me to, though.

I was being disarmingly adorable and comparing him to my seancing

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the uninformed and uninterested think about Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship is as irrelevant as what the uninformed and uninterested
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think about quantum theory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, you're right, but unfortunately almost all Stratfordians bring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject up. They keep saying how there are so many more of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than us,
&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I think that's probably only true if you count English
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profs who either believe or are desperate to hold onto their jobs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those who live and work in Stratford, and the uninformed and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uninterested.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since you seem to be forgetting or disregarding the institution,
&gt;&gt;&gt; permit me to remind you that most English faculty have tenure and hence
&gt;&gt;&gt; are utterly immune to reprisals for holding unpopular positions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed, many faculty in MANY disciplines routinely explore FAR crazier
&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas, ideas that even Oxfordians would characterize as beyond the pale,
&gt;&gt;&gt; without fear of losing their positions. Indeed, that's what tenure is
&gt;&gt;&gt; for -- to permit researchers to undertake very ambitious, risky, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; speculative projects without fear of losing their posts. For example,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Harvard psychiatrist John Mack BELIEVES his patients' tales of alien
&gt;&gt;&gt; abduction and sexual abuse, and much of his research has been what one
&gt;&gt;&gt; could charitably characterize as conspiracy-mongering. And I'm sure
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you must have heard of the ideas of Leonard Jeffries, ideas which,
&gt;&gt;&gt; while deplorable, are nevertheless protected by the academic freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt; that tenure affords. If you REALLY believed that someone like Jeffries
&gt;&gt;&gt; can remain professionally unscathed after airing flagrantly inflammatory
&gt;&gt;&gt; antisemitic diatribes, yet that it would be professional suicide for an
&gt;&gt;&gt; English professor to breathe a word of his or her suspicions concerning
&gt;&gt;&gt; the authorship of the Shakespeare canon, then I would conclude that your
&gt;&gt;&gt; grasp of academic realities was tenuous in the extreme. (Incidentally,
&gt;&gt;&gt; your scenario does little to explain why so many faculty in other
&gt;&gt;&gt; disciplines -- drama, linguistics, etc., including Dartmouth's own
&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known Oxfordian Benezet, in Education -- are not sufficiently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;desperate to hold onto their jobs&quot; that they are deterred from voicing
&gt;&gt;&gt; their unorthodox opinions.)

&gt;&gt; Many of the younger faculty nowadays are not tenured.

&gt; In most institutions, for purely demographic reasons, untenured
&gt; faculty comprise a VERY small percentage of the professoriate. In my
&gt; department, for example, which is comparatively young, the percentage of
&gt; faculty on the tenure track is between 5% and 10%, and at many
&gt; institutions it is much smaller. It's easy to see why: the pre-tenure
&gt; probationary period is typically six years, while a professor's career
&gt; may well last fifty years; since the number of tenure lines is normally
&gt; fixed, one would expect untenured faculty to constitute a small fraction
&gt; of the total. The situation is even more striking in the humanities,
&gt; for several reasons; one is that tenured humanities professors are
&gt; rarely lured away from academics into industry mid-career.

&gt;&gt; Especially in
&gt;&gt; Canada, there seems to be a move away from tenure as it's

Yes. I find it entertaining too, but in a different sense. I'm playing

Terry Ross very interesting to talk to. They and some others here
strike me as very intelligent, and sparring or discussing matters with
clever people of a different stripe makes one think much harder than

&gt;&gt; Drs. Popova and Brame (I think. Although I don't subscribe to their
&gt;&gt; theory that Oxford wrote almost everything)

&gt; The last time I checked, Brame was a professor of Linguistics, not of
&gt; English. The University of Washington web page still lists him as such,
&gt; with specialization in recursive categorial grammars, mathematical
&gt; linguistics, and the structure of English and Arabic. There is no
&gt; mention of any qualifications in Elizabethan literary history. While I
&gt; find the opinions concerning quantum mechanics expressed by my auto
&gt; mechanic interesting, I do not regard him as an authority on the subject.

"/>

Yes, that's why I said &quot;I think.&quot; Whether he teaches English or
Linguistics, I don't regard him as an authority either. However, one
must be careful. My sister has a Ph.D in English, but teaches
linguistics and film. Does that make her an expert? I suspect you
think it does, because she thinks all Oxfordians are barking mad.
However, although her Ph.D is in English, and although she's taught
English in the past, she has never taught Shakespeare, nor to my
knowledge particularly studied the subject. You see how muddy this can
get?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Similarly, press accounts describe Popova, perhaps inaccurately, as a
&gt; Lecturer in Slavic Studies, not a Professor of English.

"/>

And very good she is too, at reciting the sonnets in Russian.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Sarah Smith (ex-professor of English)

Yep, she gave up teaching English at a university to become a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Delahoyde

&gt; The WSU web page lists Dr. Delahoyde as &quot;Senior Instructor of
&gt; English,&quot; not as a professor of English. Moreover, his area of
&gt; specialty appears to be Medieval literature.

"/>

Oh, I see. So now we're narrowing it down. Dr. Delahoyde *is* a senior
instructor (or he was the last time I saw him, two years ago) although
he's been at WSU quite a long time. I'm sorry that I didn't understand
you meant only tenured professors. And I also didn't know you meant
*Tenured Full Professors of English Whose Specialty Is Teaching
Shakespeare.* That narrows the field so dramatically that there can't
even be that many Stratfordian professors around who fit the bill,
especially young ones who might be more amenable to reasonably new
theories. Dr. Delahoyde does have a Ph.D in English and does teach
Shakespeare, as it happens.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Several of Dr. Dan Wright's fellow professors

&gt;&quot;Several of Dr. Dan Wright's fellow professors&quot;? Do you have any
&gt; names, by any chance? This is too hopelessly vague to be taken
&gt; seriously.

"/>

You should take me seriously, David. I do not mention their names
because to my knowledge they have not spoken at conferences on the
subject and so I have no idea whether they want their names made
public. I don't tend to out people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I expect I've missed some. That was just a quick count.

&gt; As far as I can see, the &quot;quick count&quot; netted only one professor of
&gt; English, at Blackburn College.

"/>

That would be Dr. Ren Draya that you're talking about, though I
believe your count is wrong, and I think you might, for charity's
sake, include Dan Wright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of the rest, only one appears to be a
&gt; professor, and only one appears to be in English. None appears to be an
&gt; Elizabethan specialist. This leaves me perplexed concerning your
&gt; assertion that &quot;Many of the nutcases [not my word] hold bona fide
&gt; positions as English professors in universities.&quot; One is not very many.

"/>

Again, I think your count is wrong. But it depends on your
definitions. Try again. By the way, by your definition, neither Terry
Ross, nor David Kathman (whose Ph.D was on verbs, I think, and who
doesn't teach in a university or anywhere else) nor anyone else that I
know of on HLAS is any kind of expert. You've already said you're an
ignoramus, so I'll be polite and not mention you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; You should also know there are others who attend our conferences or
&gt;&gt; are members but take care not to let their departments know that they
&gt;&gt; are Oxfordians.

&gt; Professors of English at universities?

"/>

Yes. I'm really sorry to shock you so badly. But perhaps they're not
experts because they're not full professors, or they have a master's
or Ph.D in another subject, or they don't teach Shakespeare or...well,
you get the picture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Sorry, but that's the truth. You have to understand
&gt;&gt; that the way things are, it can be academic death to admit one is an
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian in certain English departments.

&gt; As I said elsewhere, the notion of &quot;academic death&quot; is rather
&gt; far-fetched in view of the institution of tenure.

"/>

The institution of tenure has become rather farfetched. As I explained
in another post, in Ontario there was a situation until just recently
where almost all the tenured profs had graduated in the sixties and
those who graduated more recently were running around finding gigs as
sessionals or part-timers or working in community colleges. When I
went back to the University of Toronto to do a teaching degree in the
nineties, every single tenured prof in the department had been there
since the late sixties.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That's why you see so many
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians from other academic departments. They tend to be freer. You
&gt;&gt; don't find professors of linguistics or drama knowledgeable in the
&gt;&gt; field?

&gt; About as knowledgeable about quantum mechanics (or even classical
&gt; mechanics) as I would expect my auto mechanic to be.

&gt;&gt; I can't imagine anyone more knowledgeable than someone who is a
&gt;&gt; drama expert, for example.

&gt; Being trained in drama is not the same as being trained in theatre
&gt; history, just as being a mathematician does not by any means confer
&gt; expertise in the history of mathematics.

"/>

First of all, many of them do have expert knowledge in theatre
history, and second, they have trodden the boards, they have lived
inside the words and emotion of the plays. They understand far better
than most of us who William Shakespeare was, even if they don't
participate in the authorship argument.

As usual, you don't speak to the point.

I find it amusing that I was defending myself against an unfounded assertion

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're here to make fun of a group of people who don't

&gt;&gt; You make it seem just a casual accident that they &quot;don't share my point
of
&gt;&gt; view.&quot; The willful misreadings, jealousy and class animosity are just
&gt;&gt; bonuses, I guess.

&gt; If I've misread something it's certainly not willful.

"/>

Quickly, tell me what Jonson said about Shakespeare in *Timbers*?

What was Tom Heywood talking about when he wrote &quot;so the Author I know much
offended with M. *Jaggard* that (altogether vnknowne to him) presumed to
make so bold with his
name?&quot;

I find it curious that in order for Oxfordians or other anti-stratfordians
to hold the belief that Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare, they find it
necessary to believe that every contemporary who wrote about the man was
either lying, being ironic or sarcastic, or carefully betraying a vast
conspiracy by writing in code.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And of what or
&gt; whom am I jealous, Tom? What is my class animosity? I come from
&gt; immigrant stock and my father belonged to the Labour Party in England.
&gt; My grandmother was a Communist. It would have killed her to know the
&gt; crimes that Stalin committed.

"/>

So I would guess you come to historical denial honestly .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; And since I'm so foolish, what is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the point of asking me questions at all? Just for entertainment value?

&gt;&gt; Well, yes. It is very entertaining. I can't think of any other reason to
be
&gt;&gt; here, can you?

&gt; Yes. I find it entertaining too, but in a different sense. I'm playing
&gt; hookey when I should be writing my next book. So it's entertaining
&gt; because it's time limited, for the most part, and because there is
&gt; such a variety of belief. I also find people such as David Webb and
&gt; Terry Ross very interesting to talk to. They and some others here
&gt; strike me as very intelligent, and sparring or discussing matters with
&gt; clever people of a different stripe makes one think much harder than
&gt; one does when one is in a group of like-minded people. Sometimes it
&gt; makes one change one's mind about certain things too, if one is not
&gt; closed to different ideas.

"/>

Can you point out an instance in which you changed your mind as the result
of something somebody posted on this board? I don't mean just being
corrected on a fact and admitting it. I mean have you changed any of your
ideas? Terry probed you for your beliefs on exactly what Elizabethan
attributations you accept and the basis for them earlier, but judging from
your reponses, he might as well been talking to a wall.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

Umm, I was talking about you putting words into my mouth. So I guess, since
you didn't address the issue, that you admit it? (See how easy it is to do?)

you write back to people

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; who are addressing me before I have a chance to and tell them with
&gt; great assurance what I think or what my motives are, all the while
&gt; using the third person when referring to me.

"/>

1. Your first example refers to where I said, &quot;Because she wants Shakespeare
to be a Romantic.&quot; That was in answer to a question from Bob about why you
insisted the works had to contain autobiographical material.

You see, you *DO* want him to be a Romantic, as is obvious from your
criteria for the True Author, but you might not know that consciously or be
able to answer that question so succinctly, so I answered that for your
benefit so you might become aware of your motivations. (You know me: always
trying to help.)

From an old post I wrote back before I mellowed out:

The idea of Oxford-as-Shakespeare is driven by the image of what Oxfordians
think the writer must have been like. Unfortunately, their expectations are
bound to Romanticism, a movement that began in Germany near the end of the
18th century, and Oxfordians seem unable to disassociate their hero from the
milieu of their own time and culture. Consequently, their assumptions about
Elizabethan times are wrong and anachronistic.

Romanticism is explicitly self-conscious and self-referential. At the heart
of romanticism is the rejection of orthodox social norms as oppressive and
corrupting. The romantic believes in freedom and individuality. It is an
imaginative freedom. Having been frustrated in the &quot;world of affairs,&quot;
usually because of his &quot;honesty,&quot; the romantic retreats into the power of
imaginative reflection which provides for the &quot;eternal agility&quot; which
enables
him to express his freedom and individuality.

Oxford, although none of his known poetry is self-referential, is forced
into
all these roles by 20th-century Oxfordians. In their minds,
Oxford-as-Shakespeare is a romantic character. All the characteristics of
romanticism are read into Oxford's life by those who demand a poet more in
keeping with their culturally-bound idea of who the author of Shakespeare's
works should be. Oxford fulfills all the requirements of a romantic hero:
wanderer, outlaw, prodigal child, rebel, lost lover, and victim of
consumptive
death.

In order to warp Oxford into the role of Shakespeare, Oxfordians must also
warp history. They &quot;explain away&quot; the lack of evidence for their beliefs by
incorporating the lack of evidence into their belief. They posit a scenerio
in which some necessity forces Oxford into keeping his playwriting secret
from the world. By far their most bizarre &quot;explanation&quot; is the &quot;Tudor Rose&quot;
theory, in which Oxford is the illegitimate child of Queen Elizabeth, who
then had an incestuous relationship with his mother and begat Southhampton,
the supposed &quot;fair youth&quot; of the sonnets, with whom Oxford then had a
homosexual relationship.

When confronted with direct evidence of their irrationality and foolishness,
Stratfordians become part of the plot. Oxfordians will not, or cannot,
evaluate their own beliefs and those of their opponents objectively. They
fold their arms, shut their minds, and cling to their belief in the face of
all the evidence against it. For them objective detachment is impossible.
Any attempt to introduce them to logical, scholarly methods of argument or
accepted rules of evidence is seen by them as &quot;Stratfordian bias.&quot; For
evidence for their point of view, we are given the imbecilic anagrams of
Art,
the homosexual fantasies of Volker, and the half-witted musings of Crowley
and Streitz. If anyone is convinced by their desperate rationalizations,
that is certainly their right, but that is certainly no justification for
imposing their idiocies on the rest of us, especially given all the evidence
against the Oxfordian &quot;theory.&quot;

2. The second one, where I said, &quot;They're working to show that Milton's
comments about Shakespeare were actually derogatory, à la Diana Price on
Jonson,&quot; is just a restatement of what you had written earlier to Alen
Jones: &quot;Wish I could spill them here, but am doing some
research with someone else about why Milton might have said what he did
about Shakespeare.&quot; So I'm not putting words in your mouth or answering for
you at all. I thought Jim might not have seen your post.

You being an anti-stratfordian, I can't imagine that you would accept what
Milton said at face value. As I wrote above, I find it curious that
anti-stratfordians believe that every contemporary who wrote about
Shakespeare was either lying, being ironic or sarcastic, or carefully
betraying a vast conspiracy by writing in code. Which will it be with
Milton?

You've done this now with

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; at least two people, as if I'm some kind of inanimate object. Before
&gt; you make a further remark, I can assure you that I'm not.

&gt;&gt; And nobody here is charged a fee or scrutinized before being allowed to
&gt;&gt; post, unlike your Oxfordian clubs.

&gt; No one scrutinizes anyone who wishes to post on the Shakespeare
&gt; Fellowship public boards either. People may say what they wish
&gt; although I tend to remonstrate with them if they flame at one another.
&gt; We do charge a membership fee to belong to the organization, but as I
&gt; said to David Webb earlier, that pays for the upkeep of the boards and
&gt; the newsletter, which we can't give away free, much as we would like
&gt; to, as it costs so much to print and distribute.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Best wishes,

It's interesting that you associate the apple tree, rain barrel,

that's deeply Freudian. A more Jungian reading might emphasize
one's family apple tree, perhaps racial memory; rain barrel as
container of tears descending from your house, the cellar door as
portal to your archetypal memories and the unconscious. The
playmate plays the game by pretending &quot;the dollies&quot; have the flu,

Art, one of your charms is that you almost never provide arguments; it
would be a shame (and a category error) if we had to treat your posts as
matters that merited refutation. You joined this part of the thread in
response to my post showing that B&amp;P had proven that Oxford was Virgil
(although they themselves did not realize this), so references to them are
not entirely off-topic.

As for their no longer being &quot;here to defend themselves,&quot; I had not heard
that they were dead. In that case, their arguments will have to speak for
themselves, and we will have to do our best to keep straight faces when
B&amp;P are buried. One can, of course, find Oxford's fingerprints throughout
their book, which proves that they were Oxford, and therefore immortal, so
I think the rumor you are trying to spread is probably unfounded.

&lt;&lt;In 1895, this tall, skinny, virtually penniless 16-year-old, the
firstborn son of Hasidic Jews, walked out of Warsaw 300 miles to the
Oder River, crossed and then hiked another 200 miles to Hamburg, where
a kindly GLOVEMAKER named Liebglid raised the 18 shillings required
to put him on the boat train to London. From there Schmuel tramped on
to Birmingham, and in 1898 sailed steerage to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
continuing on to Gloversville, N.Y., where he found work as a
GLOVEMAKER. Only a year later Goldfish, who would be a compulsive
gambler all his life, cheating at the poker table and croquet, was
sufficiently at home to bet $2 that Harvard would beat Yale in a
football game. He had also absorbed the copybook maxims that would
pepper his speech for the rest of his days - ''Haste makes waste,''

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The original name of Nova Scotia was ARCADIA, but the r was dropped to
shorten it to &quot;Acadie&quot;. It is from Acadie that the &quot;Cajuns&quot; of Louisiana
are from, who sing the old folk song &quot;Good King Dagobert&quot;. Some authors
claim that Prince Henry Sinclair sailed to A(r)cadia in the 14th
century, and may have even brought the Grail with him, leaving
it in Oak Island. The blue lotus or waterlily, the stargate
of the Egyptians, also grows in ARCADIA National Forest.

ARCADIA, the place in Greece thought to be the home of the oldest
antideluvian races, was also associated in medieval iconography and
symbolism with the &quot;underground stream&quot; Alphaeus, which was said to
flow all the way to Sicily. According to the &quot;prieure documents,&quot;
the Benjaminites, who were ancestors of the Merovingians, fled to the
ARCADIA region of Greece, and later migrated to Europe, becoming one
of the ancestral origins of the Salian Franks. Rene D'Anjou did a
great deal to promote the romantic idea of ARCADIA and it turns
up in much of his work, as well as Renaissance poems &amp; songs.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;As with many other aspects of this mystery, the importance
of Rosslyn Chapel is unclear and seems to have been obfuscated,
unfortunately. Its owners, the Sinclairs, claim to be the hereditary
patrons of Scottish Freemasonry, to have explored the New
World (particularly Nova Scotia and Oak Island) a century before
Colombus, and to be connected to the Templars through marriage
and descent. Some of this appears to be in doubt, because
it's based on the work of Jacobite historian Father HAY,
who used documents that were lost in a fire...&gt;&gt;

Five oldest Northern European municipality in the Western Hemisphere:

1) St. John's in Newfoundland founded by the British;

2) Annapolis Royal (formerly Port Royal)

4) Quebec City founded by the French in 1608 and
5) St. George in Bermuda 1612.

Toward the end of his reign in1621,
James granted vast territories in what are now the Maritime
Provinces of Canada to Sir William Alexander, later earl of Stirling, to
establish a Scottish colony, Nova Scotia. Alexander said that in an age
of New England, France, and Spain, Scots would not support attempts to
set up overseas plantations

&quot;unless . . . they might likewise have a New Scotland.&quot;

INTRODUCTORY TO &quot;THE SCARLET LETTER&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne

In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in
the days of old KING DERBY, was a bustling wharf--but which is now
burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms
of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its
melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia
schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood--at the head, I say, of
this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and along which,
at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the track of many
languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass--here, with a view
from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and
thence across the harbour, stands a spacious edifice of brick.

&lt;&lt;GLENELG is one of the most common palindromic geographic names
worldwide. The original is a village in Scotland. There's also a town in
Maryland, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, a village in Nova
Scotia, and a township in Ontario. Because there was a Lord Glenelg (the
only one with that name) who was the British Colonial Secretary in the
1830s, the name is on various other features, such as streets and
rivers, in Australia and New Zealand. At Glenelg High School
in Maryland, the yearbook is the Palindrome.&gt;&gt;

1) Well, the monument states that Shakespere was Virgil.

2) And the Sonnets dedication essentially states that Vere &amp; Virgil are
one:

OUR.EVER-LIVING. POET.

3) And since both Vere &amp; Virgil were paid to glorify their country &amp; history

that their works had to be published posthumously by friends) then B&amp;P don't
have to prove that Oxford was Virgil.

Yes, rubbish, if England counts as &quot;Europe&quot;. I started school in 1937 and we
used paper and pencil right from the start. The &quot;slates&quot; mentioned were toys
for use at home, when we were pretending to be the teacher writing on the
blackboard. My mother's experience (from 1909 onwards) was the same. What
was used in earlier times I don't know. (The famous &quot;Quiney&quot; letter is
presumably ink on paper, but that was written by someone well beyond the
learning stage.)

&gt;&lt;&lt;Robert Greene's &quot;Friar Bacon &amp; Friar Bungay&quot; (1594) was a play believed

&gt; earlier (1593). It tells the science-fictional story of how Friar Bacon,
&gt; and his adept-sidekick Bungay, constructed by magical means a BRASS head.
&gt; Bacon summons the Devil, who says that the head will speak within a month.
&gt; Bacon is exhausted from waiting and watching for three weeks, so he leaves
&gt; his servant Mickey Mouse -- whoops, no, that's &quot;Fantasia&quot; -- I mean Miles
&gt; to watch for him. The head finally speaks two words: &quot;Time is.&quot; Miles
&gt; doesn't think it's worth waking Friar Bacon. The head speaks again: &quot;Time

&gt; Chapter LXI-LXII

&gt;&lt;&lt;Quixote lodges with a wealthy gentleman named Don Antonio Moreno, who
&gt; intends to play jokes on Quixote with care not to harm the knight. Don
&gt; Antonio and his friends enjoy Sancho's witty remarks, as well. Later that
&gt; night, Don Antonio speaks to Quixote privately, swearing him to secrecy.
Don
&gt; Antonio tells Quixote that he has a bronze head that was created by a
Polish
&gt; man who was &quot;one of the greatest enchanters and wizards the world ever
had,&quot;
&gt; having been taught by the famous Escotillo. The head is mute on Fridays,
but
&gt; on all other days, it answers every question asked to its ear. Quixote is
&gt; dressed and taken for a walk around town, but Don Antonio's men have
pinned
&gt; a parchment to Quixote's back reading: &quot;This is Don Quixote de la Mancha.&quot;
&gt; Quixote marvels at how everyone who walks past him says out loud &quot;This is
&gt; Don Quixote de la Mancha.&quot; Returning to Don Antonio's home, Don Quixote is
&gt; the main amusement at a ball that is thrown by Don Antonio's wife. Don
&gt; Quixote dances for a time, but then he sits down on the floor in the
center
&gt; of the dance hall. Sancho puts Quixote to bed.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&lt;&lt;The next morning, Don Antonio decides to experiment with the talking
&gt; enchanted head. Don Antonio has told two of his friends about the ruse and
&gt; they join him, along with Don Antonio's wife, two of her friends, Quixote
&gt; and Sancho Panza. The group is marveled by the head's ability to answer
&gt; various questions. The talking head is a machine of course, hollowed with
an
&gt; inner pipe, through which a man in another room answers the questions he
has
&gt; heard. Don Antonio keeps the head for a little more than a week,
destroying
&gt; it before he comes under the suspicions of the Inquisition.

&gt; Walking around the town, Quixote sees a sign that says &quot;Here books are
&gt; printed,&quot; and so he enters. Quixote spends some time with a translator.
The
&gt; printers are correcting a version of the Second Part of the Ingenious
&gt; Gentleman Don Quixote de la Mancha, written by an inhabitant of
Tordesillas.
&gt; Quixote says that he is surprised that the book has not already been
burned
&gt; for its impertinence.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&quot;What answer wouldst thou have, beast?&quot; said Don Quixote; &quot;is it not

&gt;&quot;Yes, it is enough,&quot; said Sancho; &quot;but I should have liked it to have made
&gt; itself plainer and told me more.&quot;

&gt; The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which
&gt; all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in the secret.
&gt; This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to keep the
&gt; world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange magical mystery
&gt; in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another head, the work of
an
&gt; image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at
home
&gt; for his own amusement and to astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism
was
&gt; as follows. The table was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper,
&gt; and the pedestal on which it stood was of the same material, with four
&gt; eagles' claws projecting from it to support the weight more steadily. The
&gt; head, which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was
coloured
&gt; like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was
&gt; fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal
of
&gt; the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the
&gt; head, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath the
&gt; chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the
pedestal,
&gt; table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin
&gt; carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room below
corresponding
&gt; to the one above was placed the person who was to answer, with his mouth
to
&gt; the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above
downwards,
&gt; and from below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was
&gt; impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio's, a smart
&gt; sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he had been told beforehand
&gt; by his uncle who the persons were that would come with him that day into
the
&gt; chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the
&gt; first question at once and correctly; the others he answered by
guess-work,
&gt; and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous
&gt; contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became
noised
&gt; abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchanted head that
&gt; answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come
&gt; to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter
to
&gt; the inquisitors, who commanded him to break it up and have done with it,
&gt; lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote, however,
and
&gt; by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of
&gt; answering questions, though more to Don Quixote's satisfaction than
&gt; Sancho's.

The Tin Woodman of Oz by L. Frank Baum
Chapter Eighteen. The Tin Woodman Talks to Himself

The Tin Woodman had just noticed the CUPBOARDs and was curious to know
what they contained, so he went to one of them and opened the door.
There were shelves inside, and upon one of the shelves which was about
on a level with his tin chin the Emperor discovered a Head -- it looked
like a doll's head, only it was larger, and he soon saw it was the Head
of some person. It was facing the Tin Woodman and as the CUPBOARD door
swung back, the eyes of the Head slowly opened and looked at him. The
Tin Woodman was not at all surprised, for in the Land of Oz one runs
into magic at every turn.

&quot;Dear me!&quot; said the Tin Woodman, staring hard. &quot;It seems as if I had
met you, somewhere, before. Good morning, sir!&quot;

&quot;You have the advantage of me,&quot; replied the Head. &quot;I never saw you
before in my life.&quot;

&quot;Still, your face is very familiar,&quot; persisted the Tin Woodman. &quot;Pardon
me, but may I ask if you -- eh -- eh -- if you ever had a Body?&quot;

&quot;Yes, at one time,&quot; answered the Head, &quot;but that is so long ago I can't
remember it. Did you think,&quot; with a pleasant smile, &quot;that I was born
just as I am? That a Head would be created ...

It's a conclusion I arrived at after seeing a note

Have you ever considered the idea that your theory

They are so well placed that they have been able to
forge all sorts of evidence, but when Baconianism
first popped up it's pointy little head, they somehow
failed to &quot;discover&quot; the documents that would
prove to everybody's satisfaction that Shakespeare
was Shakespeare. Think about it. The &quot;Freemasons&quot;
in the mid 17th century could have planted whatever
they wanted. By now, we could have a dozen extant

prove he was the son of a glover. So why don't we have

Is it the scale of the conspiracy that matters here? Do you get points

These same players and sharers were closely associated with a small
number of highly-placed men at Court, which suggests a degree of
privilege and protection not enjoyed by other companies and troupes.

Hmm. Charitable, charitable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; More persuasive than the handwriting analysis,
&gt; perhaps, is the surprisingly large number of
&gt; uncommon spelling links between Addition II and
&gt; the several quarto and First Folio texts which other
&gt; evidence leads us to believe were set up from
&gt; Shakespeare's autograph manuscripts, usually
&gt; from his &quot;foul papers&quot; (see, below, the notes to
&gt; lines 2, 8, 28, 39, 50,53,62,128,136). Shakespeare's
&gt; authorship is also strongly substantiated by what
&gt; R.W. Chambers calls &quot;the expression of ideas&quot;
&gt; (see below, in Addition II the notes to lines 10-11,
&gt; 12, 39,40,72-87,77,104-13,112-14,121-22; in
&gt; Addition III, lines 1, 9, 13-17, 15, 17-18, 19-21),
&gt; and by studies of the vocabulary (see, below, in
&gt; Addition II the notes to lines 5, 7, 18, 86, 115; in
&gt; Addition III, lines 9, 11, 16, 19) the imagery (see
&gt; the references above under &quot;expression of ideas&quot;),
&gt; and the metrical characteristics. The real strength
&gt; of the case for Shakespeare's authorship of these
&gt; two passages rests, then, not on any single piece
&gt; or kind of evidence but on the quite remarkable
&gt; manner in which several independent lines of
&gt; approach support and reinforce one another in
&gt; pointing to a single conclusion - the &quot;hand&quot; of
&gt; Shakespeare.&quot;

You have all sorts of problems -- largely
because you see no shame in ducking issues
(such as the 'fair youth' one). Your mind is
almost as weak as that of a Strat, probably
because you've only participated on forums
where tough debate is regarded as
unmannerly.

For example, the Stratman was an illiterate
bumpkin, and it is both false and a bad
tactic to concede to Strats that he was an
actor and could read. Do you think that
the other actors regarded him as the author?
And the aristocrats did so too? And that
on his frequent appearances at court, they
discussed the plays with him? And asked
him to sign copies of his works? And did
the Queen had conversations with him
about what she'd like in the plays -- such
as 'seeing Falstaff in love'? Can you hear
him, in his Brummy accent, telling her that
it would be an interesting idea?

The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting

this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went.
If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I
did not fall, it was more by Heaven's mercy than my own strength. It was
not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the
wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but

Biro pens were not in schools then - we still had slate

My &quot;rubbish&quot; didn't apply to the 16th century, but to your assertion about
the years before 1960. Almost all my primary school years, and the whole of
my secondary education, fell during the War or the years of shortage that
followed (1937-51, to be exact). There was always paper for school work,
though of very poor quality and, to judge by texture and colour, probably
recycled. (Books were also printed on such paper, for which the publishers
apologised and which by now must have largely disintegrated.) We were
required to be economical in the use of paper, leaving no blank lines
between exercises and drawing no margins.

The Web sites to which you directed us were all describing rural US or
Commonwealth schooling, I think, except for the first two. The
carefully-written &quot;Renneberg&quot; article describes life in the infants' school,
during the two years of which he progressed to using pen and ink. My guess
is that the chalk boards were for the very first stages of writing and
drawing, hardly more than play, before the youngest children could control a
pencil or pen and actually form letters. As I recall the matter, from the
very first we had paper printed with faint blue tram-lines to ensure that
the letters were uniform in height and in straight lines. My sister (four
years younger) remembers the same.We used pencil at first, not pen and ink.
The &quot;knowhere&quot; site is a sort of chat-board, not perhaps a serious source.
&quot;Vince&quot; says: &quot;o yes yes , iam very old, lets just say that when i went to
school we used slate boards and chalk!!and the school matron checked us out
each day for fleas in our heads&quot;. Fleas - A matron at a primary school -
What are we to make of this?

One personal point: you &quot;suspect that ... &quot; I &quot;come from a relatively
prosperous background&quot;. Well, relatively prosperous by the standards of an
iron-founding and mining village, perhaps, but I attended the local Wesleyan
infants and primary school and the local mixed high school: there were
private schools available, but my sister and I, and our many cousins, did
very nicely without their services. So I didn't have access to some
expensive store of paper, as you seem to suppose.

None of this, of course, throws any light on the 16th century. I simply
don't know at what stage Elizabethan children of the Shakepeares' social
class started to use paper, pen and ink. Perhaps someone in the Group is
properly informed about such matters.

3b. In 1602, Peter Brooke, the York Herald, accused Sir William Dethick, the
Garter King-of-Arms, of elevating base persons to the gentry. Brooke drew up
a list of 23 persons whom he claimed were not entitled to bear arms. Number
four on the list was Shakespeare. Brooke included a sketch of the
Shakespeare arms, captioned &quot;Shakespear ye Player by Garter.&quot; Unless one is
prepared to argue that John Shakespeare was an actor, or that William
Shakespeare's brother Edmund initiated the arms application when he was 16
and was a known player by the time he was 22, &quot;Shakespear ye Player&quot; can
only be the Shakespeare identified in other documents as an actor, William
Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon, gentleman. This is the same coat-of-arms

Of course I can. Indeed, one of my favorites was Mr. Crowley's
magisterial display of attributional acumen in the matter of KQKnave's
&quot;Ray Mignot&quot; sonnet. Mr. Crowley's pontifications still make amusing
reading:
--------------------------------------------------
&quot;It's too good. It shows too great a degree of familiarity with the
Elizabethan world for it to be a hoax. Its author has too much
sympathy with, and understanding of, the Oxfordian cause. I have to
conclude that it really is Oxford's.&quot;

&quot;So, on the face of it, it is a magnificent discovery. (As Richard
Kennedy says, it's front-page stuff.)&quot;

&quot;But if it is a hoax, just who is good enough to create it? Certainly
no one in this ng. And the notion that anyone connected with the
Stratford Trust has such a capacity is close to unthinkable.&quot;

&quot;Seriously -- is there anyone alive with that sort of talent,
experience, knowledge and understanding?&quot;

&quot;On the other hand, the internal evidence for its authenticity is
immensely strong. Unless I'm seriously mistaken, it marks the end of
the authorship debate -- or, at least, the beginning of its end. The
present crowd of useless academics will have to die out. But the real
debate will be over.&quot;

&quot;This is fatuous nonsense. If any of my interpretation is arbitrary or
haphazard, or does not fit the facts, then say so.&quot; [Mr. Crowley's
&quot;interpretation&quot; includes the assertion that Sonnets 1-17 were
addressed by Oxford to the Queen!]

&quot;You've been sampling the Christmas sherry a bit too early. Even if it
was _by_ another Elizabethan poet, to whom could it be _addressed_?
Who was the one person that the whole country wanted to see with a
legitimate and undisputed heir? It's just about possible to see Oxford
being able to address the canonical sonnets to her (and maybe this one
too -- if it was ever sent) but there's no one else.&quot;

&quot;It is -- it's glorious. This is not the story of the year or of the
decade or of the century. It's the literary and historical story of
both this millenium and the next.

But have a thought for the present professors. Their whole being
(including their salaries) is under threat.&quot;
-----------------------------------------------
As I wrote before concerning the incident, there are many tests that,
while inconclusive in *authenticating* a work, are perfectly sufficient
to detect an imposture and thereby to *rule out* a work's genuineness.
In the case of a painting, forensic tests can often establish the
presence of substances that could not be present in a genuine Velasquez.
However, Mr. Crowley was quite eager, on the basis of no evidence
whatever, other than the say-so of a Usenet persona named &quot;Ray Mignot ,&quot;
to bypass all such objective tests of the provenance of the poem, and
pompously declared it genuine -- evidently solely because it panders to
his preposterous delusion that the first seventeen sonnets are addressed
to the Queen! What is so amusing is not that Mr. Crowely was taken in
like the gullible fool that he is, but rather his complete disregard for
any objective evidence and his absolute certainty in denigrating the
prudent doubts of the better informed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; the canon.
&gt;&gt; I believe that you are confusing biography (which is perforce
&gt;&gt; speculative) with literary attribution here.

&gt;&gt; By analogy, there is abundant evidence that one Lynne Kositsky wrote
&gt;&gt; _A Question of Will_, _Rebecca's Flame_, _Candles_, and several other
&gt;&gt; highly regarded works of fiction. The evidence is robust enough that I
&gt;&gt; have no reason to question the attribution, and indeed I would be
&gt;&gt; foolhardy to do so. True, I have never seen the grammar school records
&gt;&gt; attesting that the abovementioned Lynne Kositsky is literate -- indeed,
&gt;&gt; I doubt that I could gain access to those records even if I tried -- yet
&gt;&gt; I certainly do not doubt for a moment the literacy of Ms. Kositksy.

&gt;&gt; I cannot with any certainty reconstruct her educational trajectory --
&gt;&gt; she may have been educated in England, in Canada, or elsewhere, in
&gt;&gt; public schools or private institutions, or she might even have been home
&gt;&gt; schooled. Thus any biographical reconstruction I could undertake would
&gt;&gt; perforce be mere speculation, and I would label it as such. I would
&gt;&gt; conjecture that Ms. Kositsky was educated for the most part in England
&gt;&gt; -- indeed, her writing contains occasional locutions that one would not
&gt;&gt; find in the speech of someone whose formative years had been spent in
&gt;&gt; Canada or in the U.S. I have read that she has spent time as an
&gt;&gt; educator, so I presume that as a prerequisite for that profession she
&gt;&gt; must have had some training and very probably a degree in education, but
&gt;&gt; I cannot say so with certainty, as I have not seen her diplomas.
&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, in view of her documented career trajectory, it is a
&gt;&gt; REASONABLE assumption that she has a degree in education. Thus, while I
&gt;&gt; am certain that Ms. Kositsky is literate -- indeed, far more than
&gt;&gt; literate: articulate, in fact -- I cannot reconstruct the details of her
&gt;&gt; education. Therefore I find nothing incompatible in being virtually
&gt;&gt; certaint about Shakespeare's literacy, yet being uncertain about the
&gt;&gt; detailed means by which he attained that proficiency.

&gt;&gt; If I thought like an Oxfordian (Ne dai mne Bog soiti s uma, as
&gt;&gt; Pushkin wrote), I might be perplexed concerning the apparent
&gt;&gt; incongruities between Ms. Kositsky's art and the few scraps of
&gt;&gt; biographical information that I possess about her. For example, Ms.
&gt;&gt; Kositsky has published works in the Our Canadian Girl Series -- how did
&gt;&gt; Ms. Kositsky acquire such unerring insight into Canadian girlhood as to
&gt;&gt; permit the composition of a virtual _Bildunsroman_ when by all
&gt;&gt; indications Ms. Kositsky herself grew up in a very different culture on
&gt;&gt; a different continent a vast ocean away -- indeed, in a country many of
&gt;&gt; whose denizens know no more about life in Canada than they do about life
&gt;&gt; in Pakistan, say? Ms. Kositsky has also written fiction concerning the
&gt;&gt; Holocaust, yet by reason of age alone Ms. Kositsky plainly cannot have
&gt;&gt; had direct personal experience of that unthinkable ordeal. The topic of
&gt;&gt; the Shoah is not one on which an author can afford to hit even a single
&gt;&gt; false note, both in deference to the memory of the victims and by virtue
&gt;&gt; of the importance of the collective memory of the culture, yet Ms.
&gt;&gt; Kositsky's versimilitude is evidently so highly regarded that she was
&gt;&gt; awarded multiple grants to facilitate its composition. How does she do
&gt;&gt; it? Finally, Ms. Kositsky has written or is writing another work
&gt;&gt; concerning the Acadians of Nova Scotia, another milieu in which she has
&gt;&gt; no direct experience, but which one expects her to reconstruct
&gt;&gt; imaginatively and convincingly. Plainly -- at least to an Oxfordian --
&gt;&gt; this glaring mismatch between literary canon and biography must raise
&gt;&gt; serious questions. Could &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot; be a pseudonym for a widely
&gt;&gt; traveled aristocrat? Could the real Lynne Kositsky be an illiterate or
&gt;&gt; scarcely literate &quot;front&quot; for someone who is precluded by virtue of his
&gt;&gt; station from a pursuit as frivolous as the composition of children's
&gt;&gt; literature?
&gt; Oh, David, you guessed. And the true author managed to keep it a
&gt; secret for such a long time. He will be so annoyed with me. He can't
&gt; be seen to be writing kidlit because he writes the scripts for porno
&gt; movies.

I thought as much. The fact that the true author was unable to
resist the use of titles like _Rebecca's Flame_, _Claire by Moonlight_,
_Rachel: A Mighty Big Imagining_, etc. was quite suggestive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Dark, disturbing thoughts, as Charles Kinbote would say.

&gt;&gt; Fortunately, however, I do not think like an Oxfordian. I have no

&gt;&gt; incomplete my conjectural reconstruction of her education may be. Nor
&gt;&gt; do I require documentary proof of her education (transcripts, diplomas,
&gt;&gt; employment records, etc.) to convince me that Lynne Kositsky is indeed
&gt;&gt; the author of the highly regarded literary works attributed to Lynne
&gt;&gt; Kositsky, and that she is therefore literate.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to prove anything, just showing, in fact,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is no proof of anything in this case. I'm surprised you

Precisely. It really does not require THAT much education for an
intelligent, imaginative person to conduct research adequate for the
purposes of writing fiction, even in exotic and unfamiliar locales. In
that regard you are surely better qualified than Shakespeare, some of
whose slips in VERsimilitude are well known (although they do not
detract from the many virtues that draw playgoers and readers to his
literary output).

&gt; 4. *A Question of Will* is easily explained by the fact that I am an

&gt; 5. My next book out, *The Thought of High Windows*, is about the
&gt; Holocaust and contains some thinly veiled portraits of acquaintances.
&gt; I am not an earl of the realm, so they may sue. There are other bits

The names of Lear's dogs (Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart) might for
all we know be the names of Shakespeare's beloved and much missed pets.
However, Shakespeare is not around to divulge the names of his animal
companions. Nor would a researcher some four hundred years from now be
apt to discover the names of your golden retrievers. The larger point
is that the supposed &quot;excellent fit&quot; to which you allude is only readily
apparent to those who can discover pertinent and sometimes intimate
biographical data: the names of your pets, the fact that you had
acquaintances directly affected by the Shoah, etc. Since so little is
known about Shakespeare's biography, what might be an excellent fit may
simply not be evident for want of information.

&lt;&lt;Oxford was accompanied on his journey to Italy, including Venice, by the
Englishman Nathaniel Baxter, who recalled the event in a publication he
entitled Sidneys Ourania, printed in 1606 (STC 1598), two years after
Oxford's death. Although the publication is dedicated to Philip Sidney's
sister Mary, countess of Pembroke, a poem within the volume (on sig. A3v) is
dedicated to Oxford's daughter Susan Vere, and assigns her conception to
Oxford's miraculous rescue from &quot;infamie&quot; (here, Oxford is the &quot;Prince&quot; and
also the &quot;Albanian dignitie&quot; - or British nobleman). The first three
stanzas, which are an acrostic on the de Vere motto (&quot;mot&quot; or posy),
are as follows:

To the Right Noble, and Honorable Lady Susan Vera Mongomriana.

V Aliant whilome the Prince that bare this Mot,
E Ngraued round about his GOLDEN RING:
R Oaming in VENICE ere thou wast begot,
A Mong the Gallants of th'Italian spring.

From the dictator Sulla, ROSCIUS received the honor of

the GOLD RING signifying equestrian rank.

In a lawsuit, Cicero, whom he had taught elocution,

belief of them and enjoy all the charm of the reality? There is nothing
like resolute, good-humoured credulity in these matters.&quot; It sounds
easy; like the &quot;will to believe,&quot; that William James used to talk about;

Anti-Strats routinely point out the logical
flaws in the Reedy/Kathman essay.

The anti-Strat case is that there was a state-
sponsored program to provide a cover for
the true author. A substantial sum of money
exchanged hands for this purpose before
May of 1597 (enabling the Stratman to buy
New Place). That money had to be 'justified',
so part of the cover-up involved showing
him as a sharer in the Company. A few state
documents therefore stated his name, a few
wills were altered, and his name was shown
on a few leases -- leaving us with the sum
total of about eight 'historical' documents.

End of story.

&gt; Not sure what you have in mind here. Sometimes you're not as clear as you

"/>

I am pointing out that -- under the standard
Stratfordian scenario -- the Stratman would
have often been at court -- and at the houses
of various aristocrats, performing in 'his' plays.
We would expect the learned gentlemen and
ladies present to discuss his works with them,
and to ask him to (say) sign their copies of
Venus &amp; Adonis or the plays. They would
have engaged him in conversation about
the works, discussing the details of much
of the history he presented . . who was at
which battle . . . why did he make Hotspur
the same age as Prince Hal . . . why did he
put all those inland Italian cities on the coast,
and didn't he know Rome had no clocks, or
did he really think Cleopatra played billiards
. . . and so on and on.

This scenario is shared by some of the
weaker-minded anti-Strats. But they
maintain that Stratman was only an actor
. . pretending to be the playwright.
They would have him engaging in these
discussions with no one spotting the
weakness of his answers. As a few of
the sharper Strats have pointed out, this
is not likely story.

Of course, we all really know that no such
conversations ever took place. No one
even thinks of portraying them -- even
in crappy films like 'Shakespeare in Love'.

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the canon.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that you are confusing biography (which is perforce
&gt;&gt;&gt; speculative) with literary attribution here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, there is abundant evidence that one Lynne Kositsky wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; _A Question of Will_, _Rebecca's Flame_, _Candles_, and several other
&gt;&gt;&gt; highly regarded works of fiction. The evidence is robust enough that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have no reason to question the attribution, and indeed I would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; foolhardy to do so. True, I have never seen the grammar school records
&gt;&gt;&gt; attesting that the abovementioned Lynne Kositsky is literate -- indeed,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt that I could gain access to those records even if I tried -- yet
&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly do not doubt for a moment the literacy of Ms. Kositksy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot with any certainty reconstruct her educational trajectory --
&gt;&gt;&gt; she may have been educated in England, in Canada, or elsewhere, in
&gt;&gt;&gt; public schools or private institutions, or she might even have been home
&gt;&gt;&gt; schooled. Thus any biographical reconstruction I could undertake would
&gt;&gt;&gt; perforce be mere speculation, and I would label it as such. I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; conjecture that Ms. Kositsky was educated for the most part in England
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- indeed, her writing contains occasional locutions that one would not
&gt;&gt;&gt; find in the speech of someone whose formative years had been spent in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Canada or in the U.S. I have read that she has spent time as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; educator, so I presume that as a prerequisite for that profession she
&gt;&gt;&gt; must have had some training and very probably a degree in education, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot say so with certainty, as I have not seen her diplomas.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, in view of her documented career trajectory, it is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; REASONABLE assumption that she has a degree in education. Thus, while I
&gt;&gt;&gt; am certain that Ms. Kositsky is literate -- indeed, far more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; literate: articulate, in fact -- I cannot reconstruct the details of her
&gt;&gt;&gt; education. Therefore I find nothing incompatible in being virtually
&gt;&gt;&gt; certaint about Shakespeare's literacy, yet being uncertain about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed means by which he attained that proficiency.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I thought like an Oxfordian (Ne dai mne Bog soiti s uma, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pushkin wrote), I might be perplexed concerning the apparent
&gt;&gt;&gt; incongruities between Ms. Kositsky's art and the few scraps of
&gt;&gt;&gt; biographical information that I possess about her. For example, Ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kositsky has published works in the Our Canadian Girl Series -- how did
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Kositsky acquire such unerring insight into Canadian girlhood as to
&gt;&gt;&gt; permit the composition of a virtual _Bildunsroman_ when by all
&gt;&gt;&gt; indications Ms. Kositsky herself grew up in a very different culture on
&gt;&gt;&gt; a different continent a vast ocean away -- indeed, in a country many of
&gt;&gt;&gt; whose denizens know no more about life in Canada than they do about life
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Pakistan, say? Ms. Kositsky has also written fiction concerning the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Holocaust, yet by reason of age alone Ms. Kositsky plainly cannot have
&gt;&gt;&gt; had direct personal experience of that unthinkable ordeal. The topic of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Shoah is not one on which an author can afford to hit even a single
&gt;&gt;&gt; false note, both in deference to the memory of the victims and by virtue
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the importance of the collective memory of the culture, yet Ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kositsky's versimilitude is evidently so highly regarded that she was
&gt;&gt;&gt; awarded multiple grants to facilitate its composition. How does she do
&gt;&gt;&gt; it? Finally, Ms. Kositsky has written or is writing another work
&gt;&gt;&gt; concerning the Acadians of Nova Scotia, another milieu in which she has
&gt;&gt;&gt; no direct experience, but which one expects her to reconstruct
&gt;&gt;&gt; imaginatively and convincingly. Plainly -- at least to an Oxfordian --
&gt;&gt;&gt; this glaring mismatch between literary canon and biography must raise
&gt;&gt;&gt; serious questions. Could &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot; be a pseudonym for a widely
&gt;&gt;&gt; traveled aristocrat? Could the real Lynne Kositsky be an illiterate or
&gt;&gt;&gt; scarcely literate &quot;front&quot; for someone who is precluded by virtue of his
&gt;&gt;&gt; station from a pursuit as frivolous as the composition of children's
&gt;&gt;&gt; literature?

&gt;&gt; Oh, David, you guessed. And the true author managed to keep it a
&gt;&gt; secret for such a long time. He will be so annoyed with me. He can't
&gt;&gt; be seen to be writing kidlit because he writes the scripts for porno
&gt;&gt; movies.

&gt; I thought as much. The fact that the true author was unable to
&gt; resist the use of titles like _Rebecca's Flame_, _Claire by Moonlight_,
&gt; _Rachel: A Mighty Big Imagining_, etc. was quite suggestive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fortunately, however, I do not think like an Oxfordian. I have no

&gt;&gt;&gt; incomplete my conjectural reconstruction of her education may be. Nor
&gt;&gt;&gt; do I require documentary proof of her education (transcripts, diplomas,
&gt;&gt;&gt; employment records, etc.) to convince me that Lynne Kositsky is indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; the author of the highly regarded literary works attributed to Lynne
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kositsky, and that she is therefore literate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to prove anything, just showing, in fact,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is no proof of anything in this case. I'm surprised you

&gt; Actually, I was basing that on what you've said in this forum.

&gt;&gt; There is a very good fit between the subjects I choose and my

&gt;&gt; 1. As an ex-teacher, I write for young adults.

Nope, but I've been here far longer than I ever lived in England.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 3. As a Jew, I tend to write about protagonists who have been
&gt;&gt; downtrodden in one way or another: the Catholic Irish, the Acadians,
&gt;&gt; the Indians of Haida Gwai, ex-slaves after the American Revolution,

&gt; ...all milieus of which the putative author &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot;
&gt; possesses no direct experience...

"/>

If by milieus you mean places, that's not true. Let us take *Claire by
Moonlight* for example. I have made repeated trips to Grand-Pre (can't
write the acute accent)and to the whole Acadian coastline of Nova
Scotia. For the second part of the book, which talks about the
expulsion of the Acadians, I made many visits to Boston and to
Deerfield, the Wanefield of the novel. I also travelled via the Indian
path, now the Mohawk Way, visited Fort William Henry, spoke to the
staff and archaeologists, and travelled up Lake St. George and Lake
Champlain towards Montreal, as Claire did. This has been my pattern
with almost every book.

If by milieus you mean my characters' social milieus, that is
impossible as they're in the past, so I reconstruct as far as I can
using research, but have to admit that I, like any other writer, must
to some extent base their feelings on my own experience and the
experiences of those I know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and of course the children of the Holocaust. My poetry (for adults)
&gt;&gt; explores similar themes. I have had enough education to research and
&gt;&gt; write on these topics,

&gt; Precisely. It really does not require THAT much education for an
&gt; intelligent, imaginative person to conduct research adequate for the
&gt; purposes of writing fiction, even in exotic and unfamiliar locales. In
&gt; that regard you are surely better qualified than Shakespeare, some of

Since &quot;palitable&quot; is not an English word, and since its derivation

intentionally, for reasons of your usual anagrammatic wordplay. Indeed,
&quot;palitable&quot; is a perfect anagram of &quot;I ball a pet,&quot; probably Oxford's
candid confession of his relationship with his pet Orazio Cogno, if not
with Blanche, Tray, and Sweetheart. Indeed, Lynne noted above that the
&quot;smoking gun&quot; was Sweetheart, so the latter possibility cannot be ruled
out.

Incidentally, Art, if Wood is the &quot;good cop&quot; and Nelson is the &quot;bad

single-handedly transforms the Oxfordian &quot;theory&quot; into hilarious,

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://shakespeareauthorship.com/howdowe.html

&gt;&gt;&gt; wherein they show the logical links between the Stratford
&gt;&gt;&gt; guy, the actor, the businessman, and the playwright?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think they do a good job. Perhaps I've missed
&gt;&gt;&gt; something. Could you point out the logical flaws in their
&gt;&gt;&gt; essay? So far no other anti-Strat has been able to.

&gt;&gt;Anti-Strats routinely point out the logical
&gt;&gt;flaws in the Reedy/Kathman essay.

&gt; I must have missed them. Could you perhaps provide
&gt; a brief summary of those logical flaws?

&gt;&gt;The anti-Strat case is that there was a state-
&gt;&gt;sponsored program to provide a cover for

There's no evidence to support that theory.

What there is evidence of--the Northumberland MS is
one piece of it--is the fact that Essex was called before
the Privy Council and again before the Star Chamber to
explain his patronage of the author of the 'seditious'
Richard II.

The fact that Essex was under suspicion for Richard II and the
fact that he was Bacon's patron is thoroughly documented.

The Elizabethans were very concerned with *appearances,*
the Conformity laws of the Anglican Church are an example
of this. It didn't matter what you were thinking, as long
as you went through the motions.

It was important to *give the appearance* of having an
author for the Shakespeare works--which had been totally
anonymous until Essex got into hot water--so an actor whose
name was similar to the 'William Shakespeare' on the V &amp; A
was recruited, given a payoff and went back to Stratford to
lie low until Elizabeth died.

Bacon's nephew Matthew Bacon, son of his half-sister
Anne Bacon is in the titles to Blackfriars and New Place and
it's odd because the family held on to the titles as if they
were holding something over the Stratford actor's head--
he had to sue Matthew Bacon to get clear title to Blackfriars
and I don't believe he had title to New Place in his lifetime--
both places passed to his heirs and of course the Puritans
confiscated Blackfriars because it was a bawdy house.

Elizabeth didn't really want to kill Essex (the Cecils did) and
she couldn't live without Bacon who she had keep by her side
at Court since he was a toddler (her 'Baby Solomon') and all would
have gone well but Essex would not listen to Bacon's advice as
documented in letters to Essex.

I personally think Essex was being slowly poisoned--he was
sick all the time after Southampton became his 'male varlet'--
they had an 'amity friendship' or somethin' goin' on--and Essex
became increasingly irrational. His step-father Leicester was
poisoned. There was an amazing amount of poisoning going
on in a culture where murder was looked upon with such horror.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I see. And the person these 'state sponsors' chose

&gt; words) an &quot;illiterate bumpkin&quot;? And you think such a

"/>

There's no motive. Bacon didn't need a State Conspiracy to
write the Shakespeare works. He only had to pretend he wasn't
writing them (the rival poets were making a racket but Whitgift
stepped on them from time to time).

The Oxfordian Conspiracy Theory--I assume that's what
we're talking about--doesn't take into consideration the
peculiarities of the Elizabethan mind.

The Elizabethans didn't think like us. Form was everything.
Pretense was as good as substance.

If Oxford had wanted to conceal his works--and he did just
the opposite, he openly promoted himself as a poet--Oxford
would only have to go about his business of being an earl
and and anyone who mentioned his authorship of the
Shakespeare plays would simply have had their tongue
cut out and everything would go on as if nothing had
happened.

Conformity of religion worked the same way. As long as
you looked like you were an Anglican, you were fine.
Elizabeth had a 'behind closed doors' policy and the
Catholic nobility was taking Catholic communion in their
private chapels and as long as they didn't take it out in
the fresh air, it was perfectly fine with her.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, except they're trying to prove that Shakespeare of Strat wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the canon.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that you are confusing biography (which is perforce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speculative) with literary attribution here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, there is abundant evidence that one Lynne Kositsky wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _A Question of Will_, _Rebecca's Flame_, _Candles_, and several other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; highly regarded works of fiction. The evidence is robust enough that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have no reason to question the attribution, and indeed I would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foolhardy to do so. True, I have never seen the grammar school records
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attesting that the abovementioned Lynne Kositsky is literate -- indeed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt that I could gain access to those records even if I tried --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly do not doubt for a moment the literacy of Ms. Kositksy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot with any certainty reconstruct her educational trajectory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she may have been educated in England, in Canada, or elsewhere, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public schools or private institutions, or she might even have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schooled. Thus any biographical reconstruction I could undertake would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perforce be mere speculation, and I would label it as such. I would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conjecture that Ms. Kositsky was educated for the most part in England
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- indeed, her writing contains occasional locutions that one would not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find in the speech of someone whose formative years had been spent in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Canada or in the U.S. I have read that she has spent time as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; educator, so I presume that as a prerequisite for that profession she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must have had some training and very probably a degree in education,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot say so with certainty, as I have not seen her diplomas.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, in view of her documented career trajectory, it is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REASONABLE assumption that she has a degree in education. Thus, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am certain that Ms. Kositsky is literate -- indeed, far more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literate: articulate, in fact -- I cannot reconstruct the details of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education. Therefore I find nothing incompatible in being virtually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certaint about Shakespeare's literacy, yet being uncertain about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detailed means by which he attained that proficiency.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I thought like an Oxfordian (Ne dai mne Bog soiti s uma, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pushkin wrote), I might be perplexed concerning the apparent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; incongruities between Ms. Kositsky's art and the few scraps of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biographical information that I possess about her. For example, Ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kositsky has published works in the Our Canadian Girl Series -- how did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ms. Kositsky acquire such unerring insight into Canadian girlhood as to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; permit the composition of a virtual _Bildunsroman_ when by all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indications Ms. Kositsky herself grew up in a very different culture on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a different continent a vast ocean away -- indeed, in a country many of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whose denizens know no more about life in Canada than they do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Pakistan, say? Ms. Kositsky has also written fiction concerning the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Holocaust, yet by reason of age alone Ms. Kositsky plainly cannot have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had direct personal experience of that unthinkable ordeal. The topic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Shoah is not one on which an author can afford to hit even a single
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false note, both in deference to the memory of the victims and by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; virtue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the importance of the collective memory of the culture, yet Ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kositsky's versimilitude is evidently so highly regarded that she was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awarded multiple grants to facilitate its composition. How does she do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it? Finally, Ms. Kositsky has written or is writing another work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concerning the Acadians of Nova Scotia, another milieu in which she has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no direct experience, but which one expects her to reconstruct
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imaginatively and convincingly. Plainly -- at least to an Oxfordian --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this glaring mismatch between literary canon and biography must raise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; serious questions. Could &quot;Lynne Kositsky&quot; be a pseudonym for a widely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traveled aristocrat? Could the real Lynne Kositsky be an illiterate or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scarcely literate &quot;front&quot; for someone who is precluded by virtue of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; station from a pursuit as frivolous as the composition of children's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literature?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, David, you guessed. And the true author managed to keep it a
&gt;&gt;&gt; secret for such a long time. He will be so annoyed with me. He can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; be seen to be writing kidlit because he writes the scripts for porno
&gt;&gt;&gt; movies.
&gt;&gt; I thought as much. The fact that the true author was unable to
&gt;&gt; resist the use of titles like _Rebecca's Flame_, _Claire by Moonlight_,
&gt;&gt; _Rachel: A Mighty Big Imagining_, etc. was quite suggestive.
&gt; And, of course, Candles. I won't elucidate. ;)

&gt; Moonlight* for example. I have made repeated trips to Grand-Pre (can't
&gt; write the acute accent)and to the whole Acadian coastline of Nova
&gt; Scotia. For the second part of the book, which talks about the
&gt; expulsion of the Acadians, I made many visits to Boston and to
&gt; Deerfield, the Wanefield of the novel. I also travelled via the Indian
&gt; path, now the Mohawk Way, visited Fort William Henry, spoke to the
&gt; staff and archaeologists, and travelled up Lake St. George and Lake
&gt; Champlain towards Montreal, as Claire did. This has been my pattern
&gt; with almost every book.

In other words, you did some research. Virtually all good writers do.

&gt; If by milieus you mean my characters' social milieus, that is

&gt; to some extent base their feelings on my own experience and the
&gt; experiences of those I know.

Check my posts. I have disagreed with *everything* you've said. Your

Sometimes one thing, sometimes another. I can post examples of dead

A BRIEF SKETCH OF FREEMASONRY

By W.Bro.ERNEST H. SHACKLETON, Templars Lodge 4302.

Masonry was at its full tide and in its full splendour, Strength, Beauty
and Wisdom its ideals, the Triangle and the Circle forming

the KEYSTONE of the ornamental tracery of every Temple.

It became too powerful, and in 1356 a Statute was enacted
prohibiting their assemblies under severe penalties -
but it seems that our ancient Brethren carried on secretly -
and in 1485 Masonry revived and at a later date did splendid
work in the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire in 1666.

That's harder than you might think, David. The publisher would then
have to be in on it as there are legal contracts to sign that I
believe must be signed in my own name. Whereas a front man (or in this
case woman) could sign the contracts. It's fun to think about, but I
can't really imagine myself getting involved in it. It's interesting
that publishers think that writing about Native Peoples is cultural
appropriation, but no one has made a fuss about my writing about
Catholic Irish; Catholic, French Acadians; Black Loyalists, etc.
Someone has written an article about cultural appropriation, using me
and a couple of other writers as examples.

I don't have time to answer the whole of the rest of your post now,
but would like to talk a little about what we might term Shakespeare's
foreign flubs. The person who to my mind has done the most research on
the geography (or foreign mores or laws) that Shakespeare presumably
got wrong is Richard Roe. His work is quite outstanding as he spends
his time travelling to the places mentioned in the plays, particularly
Italy, and also in examining the documents. I believe you'd enjoy what
he says, especially the material on MOV. Unfortunately though, I've
only heard him speak on the topic. And Shakespeare Matters only has
one short interview with him. I'll try to send it with the other
article when I have time to. His book has been &quot;about to be published&quot;
for many years, but he keeps finding more information. He reminds me a
little of Casaubon in *Middlemarch.* Not because he or his work is
dull, but because he's getting on in years and he never seems to be
finished.

I asked him about the fact that scholars say Shylock couldn't have
gone outside the ghetto to dinner because there was a curfew. He told
me he'd examined the records and found the curfew was not at sundown,
as supposed, but very late at night. He's also found what he believes
to be the actual penthouse mentioned in the play, &quot;penthouse&quot; at that
time having a different meaning of course. He gave a two-hour lecture
on Shakespeare in Italy with special attention to MOV, and I was
enthralled. On another thread I wrote:

I was lucky enough to be at the De Vere Studies conference in 2002.
Richard Roe, who has spent a lifetime visiting the places that
Shakespeare writes about and writing about them himself, gave an
incredible two hour presentation. His book, *Oxford in Italy*, is
nearing completion.

On this occasion he spoke mainly about MOV, confirming every point
that Shakespeare made about Venice and about the Jews, with regard to
religious practices, rules that governed the ghetto, the &quot;penthouse&quot;
(which still stands today), etc. I was particularly interested in his
talk because MOV is a play I've worked on quite a bit, but Roe has
also spent time in Florence and other cities both in Italy and
elsewhere, looking at the geography, searching the records and
speaking to historians. He and others have found that when Shakespeare
said there was access to the sea, this was the case *at that time.* He
could recite you all the documents to show this is so, but I'm afraid
I can't. Hopefully, when his book is published, I'll be able to.

Here is a little bit from the follow-up interview that appeared in
Shakespeare Matters, Summer 2002:

Mark Anderson: Many Stratfordians, of course, claim that
Shakespeare...got many things about Italy wrong. Have you found any
instance where this was so?

Richard Roe: Never. None...I've catalogued all the critiques from the
19th and 20th centuries--and all they're doing on the internet today
is repeating the same old stories. On all occasions, the whole
treatment of Shakespeare's [ignorance]is wrong.

Best wishes,
Lynne

No Rita, that is _not_ the issue. Nashe tells
us that 'the vulgar sort' in London spoke
'richer and purer' English . . . . as the result
of reading (or maybe learning) POETRY.

&quot;To them that demaund what fruites the Poets of our time bring

London (which is the fountaine whose riuers flowe round about
England) to aspire to a richer puritie of speach, than is
communicated with the Comminaltie of any Nation vnder heauen. &quot;

&gt; That is, speaking simply, stupid.

&gt; The facts are these (you'll correct me if I'm wrong?):
&gt; - Prior to May 1597, &quot;a substantial sum of money changed hands,&quot; ending up
&gt; in the possession of William Shakespeare of Stratford, and enabling him to
&gt; purchase New Place (real estate), at that time [at that time, is implied by
&gt; what you wrote].
&gt; - There exist about eight archival documents: leases, wills, and government
&gt; documents.

"/>

You have omitted more than a few salient facts.
We have a body of literature, supposedly
produced by someone from a small remote rural
town, who had illiterate parents and illiterate
children, all which is intensely political, and
goes right to the heart of the society on which
it was based -- and goes right to the heart of
our whole civilisation. Yet no one seems to
have met the man -- as author or poet; no one
ever got a letter from him; he seems never to
have received a letter from anyone; no one
ever wrote about the man in a literary context
. . . . and so on and on . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The following are inferences:
&gt; - The tendency of the archival documents is to show that William Shakespeare
&gt; was a partner (sharer or shareholder) in the Company.

"/>

The 'inferences' are required to explain the
existence of that literature. The rest is merely
an admittedly largely speculative filling-in of
gaps in our knowledge.

&gt;&gt; The main object of the Strats is to change the subject away from the

Actually, Nelson has been working on a Shakespeare biography for

&gt;&gt; I'm addressing only one issue, Paul. Did Nashe mean what he said when
&gt;&gt; he wrote that 'the vulgar sort' in London spoke 'richer and purer'

&gt; No Rita, that is _not_ the issue. Nashe tells

&gt; Do you really believe that?

"/>

Hurrah! you did it, you hunted out a quote. But I think you're
changing the issue again by your last question. The issue isn't
whether I believe it, and it isn't whether you believe it. It's that
Nashe wrote it, that he actually wrote, as you quoted above, that the
vulgar sort in London spoke richer, purer English than elsewhere in
England due to poetry. That makes it contemporary evidence, and that
is not something we can shrug off.

So if you want to contradict Nashe and dispute what he so clearly
wrote, you'll have to give good contemporary evidence to the contrary.
A quote from someone c.1592 complaining that Londoners spoke
particularly corrupt English would be a nice start. But just saying
&quot;I can't see it myself&quot; isn't enough.

On the other hand if you want to convince us that in this passage
Nashe was merely 'taking the piss' and not making a serious defence of
poetry - as he does in the paragraph before, for example, when he
praises the late preacher Dr. Smith for improving his pulpit skills by
reading and composing verse - then good luck. Nashe is a writer of
very varied tone, sometimes humorous and fantastic, but sometimes
serious and factual. I wouldn't like to instruct the group in how to
detect which tone he's taking at any given moment. But as it happens
I do believe he was serious in what he wrote, for the following
reason:

In Nashe's usage the term 'poets' would embrace what we call
playwrights. That being so, where else in all England would Ordinary
Joe get a better chance of improving his mind (and speech) by exposure
to poetry than in London? Seems a fair argument to me.

No need to imagine cockneys attending poetry readings at all.

His (il)literacy was virtually irrelevant.
I think we can take it that you are literate.
Suppose YOU had been proposed as the
'stand-in' for Shakespeare. Do you think
you'd have been able to carry it off?

Would your relations, friends and
neighbours be able to back up that claim?
Could they recount your great literary
exploits? Your outstanding promise since
childhood? Your great poetry? If an
investigative reporter came around, how
long would it be, before the whole story
fell apart? Err . . . . two minutes?

The same would have applied to almost
anyone. So, in many ways, it did not
really matter who the 'plotters' picked --
so long as he was surrounded by
'defences' that stopped anyone getting
to him. His neighbours and relatives
would have to be given some story --
and the more educated and literate they
were, the more difficult that would have
been. But those in Stratford need have
been told little except &quot;Don't answer
questions from strangers about Master
Shaksper -- tell them to go and see
Master Greene, the lawyer&quot;.

So anyone turning up in Stratford would
have been given a brush-off. They'd
have got nothing from the ignorant
locals. They'd soon depart knowing less
than when they arrived. That defence
may never have actually been put to the
test, but it was there in case it was needed.

&gt; big joke, there doesn't seem to have been the need for such
&gt; a cover-up in the first place. If the cover-up was serious,
&gt; to cast an &quot;illiterate bumpkin&quot; as the front man was folly
&gt; in the highest degree.

"/>

You misunderstand the nature of the
cover-up as it operated in Stratford.
The first requirement was a fair degree
of remoteness; the second: docile,
ignorant (and preferably illiterate)
relatives and neighbours;
the third: a competent local 'manager'.
That manager or supervisor would not
want to be stuck in a tiny village, far
remote from London. So the Stratford
location was a reasonable compromise
all round.

&gt; O dear, we keep going back to Bernoulli, Gemstone, and John Edward,

We were discussing the supposed weirdness of Rowse in comparison with
that of various anti-Stratfordians. To the limited extent that such
comparisons can be at all meaningful, they are meaningful only by virtue
of the comparison of specific examples. I have furnished seVERal
amusing instances of anti-Stratfordian weirdness (and there are many
more!); thus far you have only mentioned Rowse, and have come up with
nothing even close to the ...uh... eccentricity required to doubt that
the Apollo lunar landing occurred or to subscribe to the Gemstone

I'm not sure that his English is up to the task. In fact, he speaks
the tongue about the way Mr. Streitz writes it, so he would probably
have much better luck reading Mr. Streitz's book than he would reading
Shakespeare. Besides, many Oxfordians point proudly to uninformed
Supreme Court Justices who have been duped by Oxfordian misinformation

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since you seem to be forgetting or disregarding the institution,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; permit me to remind you that most English faculty have tenure and hence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are utterly immune to reprisals for holding unpopular positions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed, many faculty in MANY disciplines routinely explore FAR crazier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas, ideas that even Oxfordians would characterize as beyond the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pale,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without fear of losing their positions. Indeed, that's what tenure is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for -- to permit researchers to undertake very ambitious, risky, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speculative projects without fear of losing their posts. For example,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harvard psychiatrist John Mack BELIEVES his patients' tales of alien
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abduction and sexual abuse, and much of his research has been what one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could charitably characterize as conspiracy-mongering. And I'm sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you must have heard of the ideas of Leonard Jeffries, ideas which,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while deplorable, are nevertheless protected by the academic freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that tenure affords. If you REALLY believed that someone like Jeffries
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can remain professionally unscathed after airing flagrantly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inflammatory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; antisemitic diatribes, yet that it would be professional suicide for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English professor to breathe a word of his or her suspicions concerning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the authorship of the Shakespeare canon, then I would conclude that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grasp of academic realities was tenuous in the extreme. (Incidentally,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your scenario does little to explain why so many faculty in other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disciplines -- drama, linguistics, etc., including Dartmouth's own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known Oxfordian Benezet, in Education -- are not sufficiently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;desperate to hold onto their jobs&quot; that they are deterred from voicing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their unorthodox opinions.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the younger faculty nowadays are not tenured.

"/>

The same is true of younger faculty in drama, linguistics, etc., yet
they do not seem to fear for their professional lives.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In most institutions, for purely demographic reasons, untenured
&gt;&gt; faculty comprise a VERY small percentage of the professoriate. In my
&gt;&gt; department, for example, which is comparatively young, the percentage of
&gt;&gt; faculty on the tenure track is between 5% and 10%, and at many
&gt;&gt; institutions it is much smaller. It's easy to see why: the pre-tenure
&gt;&gt; probationary period is typically six years, while a professor's career
&gt;&gt; may well last fifty years; since the number of tenure lines is normally
&gt;&gt; fixed, one would expect untenured faculty to constitute a small fraction
&gt;&gt; of the total. The situation is even more striking in the humanities,
&gt;&gt; for several reasons; one is that tenured humanities professors are
&gt;&gt; rarely lured away from academics into industry mid-career.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Especially in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Canada, there seems to be a move away from tenure as it's too
&gt;&gt;&gt; expensive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; No Rita, that is _not_ the issue. Nashe tells
&gt;&gt; us that 'the vulgar sort' in London spoke
&gt;&gt; 'richer and purer' English . . . . as the result
&gt;&gt; of reading (or maybe learning) POETRY.

&gt;&gt;&quot;To them that demaund what fruites the Poets of our time bring
&gt;&gt; forth, or wherein they are able to proue themselues necessary to
&gt;&gt; the state. Thus I answere. First and for most, they haue cleansed
&gt;&gt; our language from barbarisme and made the vulgar sort here in
&gt;&gt; London (which is the fountaine whose riuers flowe round about
&gt;&gt; England) to aspire to a richer puritie of speach, than is
&gt;&gt; communicated with the Comminaltie of any Nation vnder heauen. &quot;

&gt;&gt; Do you really believe that?

&gt; Hurrah! you did it, you hunted out a quote. But I think you're
&gt; changing the issue again by your last question. The issue isn't
&gt; whether I believe it, and it isn't whether you believe it. It's that
&gt; Nashe wrote it, that he actually wrote, as you quoted above, that the
&gt; vulgar sort in London spoke richer, purer English than elsewhere in
&gt; England due to poetry. That makes it contemporary evidence, and that
&gt; is not something we can shrug off.

"/>

We have never had any disagreement about
what Nashe said -- but only about the way in
which you read him. In particular, what did he
mean by 'the vulgar sort'? You assume that
he meant local cockneys. I say he meant the
aspiring middle-classes.

Also, I very much doubt if the accent
(or manner of speech) of ANYONE was
changed by 'poetry' -- in any sense of
that word. If Nashe had been in a mind to
produce evidence for that assertion (which
he wasn't) what could it be?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So if you want to contradict Nashe and dispute what he so clearly
&gt; wrote, you'll have to give good contemporary evidence to the contrary.
&gt; A quote from someone c.1592 complaining that Londoners spoke
&gt; particularly corrupt English would be a nice start.

"/>

Get real, Rita. Tell us of some parallel
in recent decades or centuries -- in any
country -- where the accents of the vulgar
have been improved by 'poetry' (in any
sense).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But just saying &quot;I can't see it myself&quot; isn't enough.

"/>

It seems you believe anything you see
in print. It must make life much easier
though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand if you want to convince us that in this passage
&gt; Nashe was merely 'taking the piss' and not making a serious defence of
&gt; poetry - as he does in the paragraph before, for example, when he
&gt; praises the late preacher Dr. Smith for improving his pulpit skills by
&gt; reading and composing verse - then good luck. Nashe is a writer of
&gt; very varied tone, sometimes humorous and fantastic, but sometimes
&gt; serious and factual. I wouldn't like to instruct the group in how to
&gt; detect which tone he's taking at any given moment. But as it happens
&gt; I do believe he was serious in what he wrote, for the following
&gt; reason:

&gt; In Nashe's usage the term 'poets' would embrace what we call
&gt; playwrights. That being so, where else in all England would Ordinary
&gt; Joe get a better chance of improving his mind (and speech) by exposure
&gt; to poetry than in London? Seems a fair argument to me.

"/>

In some theoretical academic way, maybe
it's not too bad. It's a lot better that some
of the trash we are asked to believe. But
it's not too hard to think up a few more-
or-less objective tests.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No need to imagine cockneys attending poetry readings at all.

"/>

We just have to imagine them attending
the Globe, and coming out talking 'posh',
and it spreading gradually among their
workmates.

Yep. That makes sense. It rings true with
the cockneys I've met. Does it do so for
you as well?

All of us are attempting to make sense of
our historical understanding. This often
involves setting out scenarios. You will
note how rarely any Strat does this.
Imagine a film script showing the young
Stratman being sent to school by his
illiterate parents, who then spend their
scarce resources on reams of extremely
expensive paper so that he can practise
his poetry!

Examine a false scenario closely and it
rapidly falls apart.

Examine one that is basically true, and
it gradually gets stronger. And thanks
for your help, btw.

&gt; He'd been reading it with his son. Clearly he reads nothing for his

While I am no more a fan of his than I am of Bush's, you may be
reading a bit too much into his answer. I suspect that a great many
parents, when queried about the book they had read most recently, would
be compelled to name a book they had been reading with their children.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the uninformed and uninterested think about Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship is as irrelevant as what the uninformed and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think about quantum theory.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, you're right, but unfortunately almost all Stratfordians
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject up. They keep saying how there are so many more of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than us,
&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I think that's probably only true if you count English
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profs who either believe or are desperate to hold onto their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jobs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those who live and work in Stratford, and the uninformed and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uninterested.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since you seem to be forgetting or disregarding the institution,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; permit me to remind you that most English faculty have tenure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are utterly immune to reprisals for holding unpopular positions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed, many faculty in MANY disciplines routinely explore FAR
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; crazier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas, ideas that even Oxfordians would characterize as beyond the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pale,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without fear of losing their positions. Indeed, that's what tenure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for -- to permit researchers to undertake very ambitious, risky, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speculative projects without fear of losing their posts. For
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harvard psychiatrist John Mack BELIEVES his patients' tales of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alien
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abduction and sexual abuse, and much of his research has been what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could charitably characterize as conspiracy-mongering. And I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you must have heard of the ideas of Leonard Jeffries, ideas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while deplorable, are nevertheless protected by the academic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that tenure affords. If you REALLY believed that someone like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeffries
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can remain professionally unscathed after airing flagrantly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inflammatory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; antisemitic diatribes, yet that it would be professional suicide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English professor to breathe a word of his or her suspicions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concerning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the authorship of the Shakespeare canon, then I would conclude that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grasp of academic realities was tenuous in the extreme.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Incidentally,

&gt;&gt;&gt;The same would have applied to almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone. So, in many ways, it did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;really matter who the 'plotters' picked --
&gt;&gt;&gt;so long as he was surrounded by
&gt;&gt;&gt;'defences' that stopped anyone getting
&gt;&gt;&gt;to him. His neighbours and relatives
&gt;&gt;&gt;would have to be given some story --
&gt;&gt;&gt;and the more educated and literate they
&gt;&gt;&gt;were, the more difficult that would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;been. But those in Stratford need have
&gt;&gt;&gt;been told little except &quot;Don't answer
&gt;&gt;&gt;questions from strangers about Master
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shaksper -- tell them to go and see
&gt;&gt;&gt;Master Greene, the lawyer&quot;.

&gt;&gt; So the entire town of Stratford was in on the
&gt;&gt; conspiracy? I see. It was larger than I thought.

&gt; I'm outlining a back-up plan; I doubt if
&gt; it was ever implemented. All the adult
&gt; inhabitants would have laughed at the
&gt; idea that their 'William Shagsper' had
&gt; anything to do with the playwright in
&gt; London. It's very likely that no one was
&gt; pointed towards Stratford before 1623

&gt;&gt;&gt;So anyone turning up in Stratford would
&gt;&gt;&gt;have been given a brush-off. They'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;have got nothing from the ignorant
&gt;&gt;&gt;locals. They'd soon depart knowing less
&gt;&gt;&gt;than when they arrived. That defence
&gt;&gt;&gt;may never have actually been put to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;test, but it was there in case it was needed.

&gt;&gt; And in London? Nobody would question the fact that
&gt;&gt; the author Shakespeare seemed to be...an illiterate bumpkin?

&gt; The only information available in
&gt; London would be that Mr Shakespeare
&gt; 'lives privately in the country' -- that he
&gt; preferred to be reclusive at some
&gt; unknown location.

"/>

But I thought he lived in a mansion with his ward, Dick Grayson, and his
faithful servant, Alfred!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also you miss the enormous sense of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;humour involved.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly do. If the whole cover-up was such a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; big joke, there doesn't seem to have been the need for such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a cover-up in the first place. If the cover-up was serious,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to cast an &quot;illiterate bumpkin&quot; as the front man was folly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the highest degree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You misunderstand the nature of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;cover-up as it operated in Stratford.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The first requirement was a fair degree
&gt;&gt;&gt;of remoteness; the second: docile,
&gt;&gt;&gt;ignorant (and preferably illiterate)
&gt;&gt;&gt;relatives and neighbours;
&gt;&gt;&gt;the third: a competent local 'manager'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That manager or supervisor would not
&gt;&gt;&gt;want to be stuck in a tiny village, far
&gt;&gt;&gt;remote from London. So the Stratford
&gt;&gt;&gt;location was a reasonable compromise
&gt;&gt;&gt;all round.

&gt;&gt; This is pointless. I feel like I'm helping you
&gt;&gt; flesh out the basic material for a novel.

&gt; All of us are attempting to make sense of
&gt; our historical understanding. This often
&gt; involves setting out scenarios. You will
&gt; note how rarely any Strat does this.
&gt; Imagine a film script showing the young
&gt; Stratman being sent to school by his
&gt; illiterate parents, who then spend their
&gt; scarce resources on reams of extremely
&gt; expensive paper so that he can practise
&gt; his poetry!

&gt; Examine a false scenario closely and it
&gt; rapidly falls apart.

&gt; Examine one that is basically true, and
&gt; it gradually gets stronger. And thanks
&gt; for your help, btw.

&gt;&gt; But I'm concerned
&gt;&gt; that you actually think this may have happened.

&gt; It's a shame you can't find any fault
&gt; with it. How else am I to remove all the
&gt; remaining glitches from the first draft?

Paul, Elizabethan writers always use 'vulgar sort' to mean 'the common
people'.

'The end of our cariere is death, it is the necessarie object of our
aime: if it affright us, how is it possible we should step one foot
forther without an ague? The remedie of the vulgar sort is, not to
think on it.' (1603)

Should that be paraphrased:

'The end of our cariere is death, it is the necessarie object of our
aime: if it affright us, how is it possible we should step one foot
forther without an ague? The remedie of the Aspiring Middle Class is,
not to think on it'? (1603)

Or in Shakespeare, when Joan of Arc sneaks her brave lads into the
city 'dressed as countrymen, with sacks upon their backs' and tells
them to 'talk like the vulgar sort of market men' - is she telling
them to remember to pronounce their aitches and always say 'pardon'
when they burp?

Post an example of a contemporary writer using the phrase 'the vulgar
sort' to mean the 'aspiring middle class'. Or do we have to interpret
the words that way in this sole instance purely because it suits you
to do so?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, I very much doubt if the accent

Why on earth would Nashe want to 'produce evidence for that
assertion'? His contemporaries would know by the evidence of their own
ears whether the claim had any validity or not. Yet you imply he was
somehow derelict by not quoting footnotes so a disbelieving

&gt;&gt; particularly corrupt English would be a nice start.

&gt; Get real, Rita. Tell us of some parallel

It must make life easier to depend largely on your own imagination

All irrelevant. Why are you appealing to my sense of humour, or some

Elizabethans 'vulgar sort' meant 'common people'. How can you pretend
it ever meant 'aspiring middle class'?

No, don't assume. It's sloppy. Yes, Nashe generally writes with a
great deal of dash and humour. But he also sometimes writes plainly,
and occasionally even solemnly. You can only work out which by
looking at the context. You can never do what you admitted to above,
think 'Oh I know how this guy writes, so I can comment on what he said

It makes perfect sense. Nashe is talking about the impact of sudden

I would expect anyone who frequently attended performances of plays by
Shakespeare, Marlowe or even Greene, to acquire at the very least a
much larger vocabulary. An awareness of how actors pronounce words
clearly would rub off too, and if the more impressionable also
imitated the speech of actors they idolized, it wouldn't surprise me.

And it's you who characterise such speech as 'posh', applying the
class consciousness of the 20th century to the 16th. It's true
English society has always been class-ridden, but not always in
exactly the same way. Bradley's evidence - and you've posted nothing
to refute it - suggests that accent was a much less significant
indicator of social status for Elizabethans than it later became.
Within living memory all born members of the elite have spoken with
the same accent; in Elizabethan times this wasn't so, though
apparently it was becoming so.

I'm not sure why you're demanding people around the world should all

back then. So, I accept the evidence and try to adjust my ideas of
what was 'normal' behaviour for elderly legal gents in the 16th

The Medium is the Massage, the published title said, the author,
Marshall McCluhan, squirming uncomfortably in the irony of mixed
media, channels, and messages. He meant, I understand, that
media has become the message, and that we're in a Bucky Fuller
kind of global village because of electronics.

In America (I tend to think of America as Including Canada, but
Europe not including England), television has made the accents of
the Mid-West the norm; and for the same reason English everywhere
is affected by American movies, etc..

In Shakespeare's day, I understand similar conditions prevailed,
especially in London, awash in foreign terms, new classes of
people, transition from oral to written traditions. No more
Latin or French official languages, and growing interest in the
vernacular. Good thing, too. We are not tied to artificial
standards but the dictionaries reflect how we are using English.
I bet there are theses and dissertations being written about the
affect of the Internet on the English Language.

Yes, I don't want to deny regional differences. (Actually I think I
can just about tell a Canadian from an American: Canadians pronounce
the vowel sound in 'house' or 'out' more like 'hoose' or 'oot'.) But
just as Americans can recognise an accent as 'British' though they
wouldn't be able to identify where in Britain it came from, Brits
recognise an accent as 'American' though they may not know where it
originates.

American vocabulary has been imitated here for a long time; I have a
slang dictionary of 1864 which lists Americanisms then current in
England (including 'STOCKDOLAGER(sic): a heavy blow', and 'SKEDADDLE:
to retire tumultuously'). And people must have been complaining about
the imitation of American accents since they invented the talkies.
Even so, I wouldn't claim that you'd have any difficulty at all
recognising the people around me as English, purely by their accents.
But it is still true that lately I've noticed not only an increasing
uptake of American words but an imitation of American speech patterns
and occasionally vowel sounds.

Example 1: the kids at the school where I work recently held a cake
sale for charity. Their poster advertized 'Cakes! Cookies! Brownies!'
I can safely swear that twenty years ago no child at that school
would have used the word 'cookie', nor would they have known what a
brownie was. Plus their usage of the word 'like', as, like, an almost
meaningless qualifier has gone up by, like, 500 percent?

Example 2: Younger female teachers at the school habitually ask a
question not by reversing verb-pronoun word order - 'Are you really
going to take all day doing that?' - but simply by making a statement
while allowing their voices to run up at the end of the sentence:
'You're really going to take all day'(raise pitch) 'doing that?' They
use the same method to imply disbelief or surprise: 'I couldn't
believe she was doing that?' As yet I don't think I've hear a male
teacher use this intonation.

Example 3: 'Eeuugh!' A signifier of disgust/horror/disbelief used by
girls only. I'd need to be able to write it phonetically to express
how entirely, and accurately, they imitate a sound I'm sure never
originated in the English voice box.

A few pupils can, if they want, make a fair imitation of an American
accent - one good enough to fool my ear if not yours. But that wasn't
what I meant. I meant their quite unconscious adoption of intonation
and phrasing, as well as vocabulary, and I think it largely comes
through entertainment - watching American films, programmes like
'Friends' and I suppose MTV.

It doesn't bother me, either. The selfsame kids use dialect words
that were unknown to me till I tracked them down in a dictionary of
Middle English. The more influences the merrier, I say.

&gt; Interesting. My first thought, reading this, was that this is something a
&gt; mother might say to a small child, and that the teachers might be
&gt; increasingly picking up maternal-type ways of interacting with the pupils.
&gt; Then asking, whether I'd ever heard it from men, what came to mind first
&gt; were classmates in college, and more generally since then, male peers from
&gt;&quot;just enough&quot; of a higher socioeconomic background.

&gt; I think this is the standard argument and I think this argument is too
&gt; abstractly expressed to be capable either of testing or of very much
&gt; discussion. To some degree I can make the opposite argument: children and
&gt; teenagers will avoid certain things (behaviors, etc.) because they've seen
&gt; them on TV -- as opposed to in &quot;real life&quot; -- in contexts that tell them
&gt; they don't want to imitate those behaviors, styles of dress, and so forth.

&gt; My own example: piercings (even just pierced ears on boys) on suburban
kids
&gt; who, I think, don't really understand what they look like they're trying
to
&gt; be, in the eyes of older people or in the city.

"/>

Another amusing example (if I'm understanding what you're saying; sometimes
I have a hard time doing that):

Boys, from both affluent and inner city areas, who wear their baggy pants so
low that their underwear shows in the back. Some of them wear them so low
the waistband is about halfway down their buttocks.

This is an appropriation from prison culture and started when the dominent
prisoners made their &quot;girlfriends&quot; wear their pants low to advertise their
easy access for sexual purposes. Somehow the street imitators missed the
meaning of the style when they took it out of context. If they knew it, I
doubt they would wear their pants that way, because most of them subscribe
to a laughably macho point of view.

TR

(I saw a few last night, at

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the movies, kids from the area or students at the state college.) I think
&gt; this supports your point. But a different portrayal on TV shows they
&gt; watched would have led to different behavior. Another example: if we had
&gt; had the pocket money, when I was about fifteen, we might have dressed like
&gt; Madonna, as some girls did, who very obviously didn't know nearly enough
&gt; about sex to intend to put across the impression an adult might think
should
&gt; be associated with the outfits. Though _we_ didn't dress that way, we
knew
&gt; that the girls who did meant nothing at all by it. In our neighborhood,
&gt; there was a totally different style of dress, certainly not one where you
&gt; would need a hundred dollars or more to put it together. (And some adults
&gt; might have thought that style of dress not only unobjectionable but almost
&gt; obligatory for young girls, in fact.)

&gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me, either. The selfsame kids use dialect words

I agree with Janice. I would suggest that most
Canadians do *not* pronounce the vowel sound in 'house' or
'out' more like 'hoose' or 'oot'. The exception to this
might be the Maritimers, many of whom have a very distinct
accent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the imitation of American accents since they invented the talkies.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even so, I wouldn't claim that you'd have any difficulty at all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recognising the people around me as English, purely by their accents.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is still true that lately I've noticed not only an increasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uptake of American words but an imitation of American speech patterns
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and occasionally vowel sounds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 2: Younger female teachers at the school habitually ask a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question not by reversing verb-pronoun word order - 'Are you really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to take all day doing that?' - but simply by making a statement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while allowing their voices to run up at the end of the sentence:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'You're really going to take all day'(raise pitch) 'doing that?' They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use the same method to imply disbelief or surprise: 'I couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe she was doing that?' As yet I don't think I've hear a male
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teacher use this intonation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting. My first thought, reading this, was that this is
something a
&gt;&gt;&gt; mother might say to a small child, and that the teachers might be
&gt;&gt;&gt; increasingly picking up maternal-type ways of interacting with the
pupils.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then asking, whether I'd ever heard it from men, what came to mind
first
&gt;&gt;&gt; were classmates in college, and more generally since then, male peers
from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;just enough&quot; of a higher socioeconomic background.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example 3: 'Eeuugh!' A signifier of disgust/horror/disbelief used by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girls only. I'd need to be able to write it phonetically to express
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how entirely, and accurately, they imitate a sound I'm sure never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; originated in the English voice box.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A few pupils can, if they want, make a fair imitation of an American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accent - one good enough to fool my ear if not yours. But that wasn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what I meant. I meant their quite unconscious adoption of intonation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and phrasing, as well as vocabulary, and I think it largely comes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through entertainment - watching American films, programmes like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Friends' and I suppose MTV.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is the standard argument and I think this argument is too
&gt;&gt;&gt; abstractly expressed to be capable either of testing or of very much
&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion. To some degree I can make the opposite argument: children
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; teenagers will avoid certain things (behaviors, etc.) because they've
seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; them on TV -- as opposed to in &quot;real life&quot; -- in contexts that tell
them
&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't want to imitate those behaviors, styles of dress, and so
forth.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My own example: piercings (even just pierced ears on boys) on suburban
&gt;&gt; kids
&gt;&gt;&gt; who, I think, don't really understand what they look like they're
trying
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be, in the eyes of older people or in the city.

&gt;&gt; Another amusing example (if I'm understanding what you're saying;
sometimes
&gt;&gt; I have a hard time doing that):

&gt;&gt; Boys, from both affluent and inner city areas, who wear their baggy
pants so
&gt;&gt; low that their underwear shows in the back. Some of them wear them so
low
&gt;&gt; the waistband is about halfway down their buttocks.

&gt;&gt; This is an appropriation from prison culture and started when the
dominent
&gt;&gt; prisoners made their &quot;girlfriends&quot; wear their pants low to advertise
their
&gt;&gt; easy access for sexual purposes. Somehow the street imitators missed the
&gt;&gt; meaning of the style when they took it out of context. If they knew it,
I
&gt;&gt; doubt they would wear their pants that way, because most of them
subscribe
&gt;&gt; to a laughably macho point of view.

&gt;&gt; TR

&gt; I don't know that we're talking about the same thing. I am talking about
&gt; styles that have a very particular meaning for the groups in which they
&gt; originated (more or less).

It seems to me that's exactly the point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think another example, better for making this
&gt; point, would be white middle-class kids who don't know the difference
&gt; between what would be seen, in a black neighborhood, as representing a
&gt; criminal, and what would be seen as just in style. A white kid who
dressed
&gt; in the former way, and then expected his black friends to think he was
&gt; dressing like them, would be insulting them, even if unintentionally.
(From
&gt; what I know, the baggy pants style spread to non-criminal kids in black
&gt; neighborhoods a long time before being picked up even by white kids in
&gt; similar neighborhoods, much less before it spread to the suburbs. And the
&gt; prison story doesn't ring true to me, but what do I know. Anyway I heard
a
&gt; different version of it, many years ago, and have seen yours only on the
&gt; Internet, and in the past couple of years. The version I heard didn't
have
&gt; anything to do with sex.)

Well, I got the version I gave from a person who has been to prison several
times.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Of course, we cannot talk about this, because the undergraduate

it

&gt;&quot;respectable&quot; that white people do, and that I'm a racist even for
implying
&gt; they might.

&gt; When I was that age, there were &quot;right&quot; ways and &quot;wrong&quot; ways to have your
&gt; ears pierced. You would just be an idiot if you did it the wrong way. If
&gt; you think I'm saying something else, try thinking about what _all_ the

why

particular

&gt;&gt; (I saw a few last night, at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the movies, kids from the area or students at the state college.) I
think
&gt;&gt;&gt; this supports your point. But a different portrayal on TV shows they
&gt;&gt;&gt; watched would have led to different behavior. Another example: if we
had
&gt;&gt;&gt; had the pocket money, when I was about fifteen, we might have dressed
like
&gt;&gt;&gt; Madonna, as some girls did, who very obviously didn't know nearly
enough
&gt;&gt;&gt; about sex to intend to put across the impression an adult might think
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt; be associated with the outfits. Though _we_ didn't dress that way, we
&gt;&gt; knew
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the girls who did meant nothing at all by it. In our
neighborhood,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there was a totally different style of dress, certainly not one where
you
&gt;&gt;&gt; would need a hundred dollars or more to put it together. (And some
adults
&gt;&gt;&gt; might have thought that style of dress not only unobjectionable but
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; obligatory for young girls, in fact.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Janice

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me, either. The selfsame kids use dialect words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that were unknown to me till I tracked them down in a dictionary of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Middle English. The more influences the merrier, I say.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you deny 'the accents of the vulgar' are ever affected by exposure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to forms of speech different from their native own? That means all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that 20th century anguish about regional accents being affected by TV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and radio broadcasts was pure nonsense? That kids today in Britain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never pick up Americanisms by listening to MTV? What a relief.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of ANYONE saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same as Nashe -- in any country, at any
&gt;&gt;&gt; time -- that modern kids (and/or working
&gt;&gt;&gt; classes) are speaking much better than
&gt;&gt;&gt; they used to? That 'since I was a lad'
&gt;&gt;&gt; people are pronouncing their words more
&gt;&gt;&gt; distinctly, using better grammar, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaking with more elegance and style . . ?
&gt;&gt; Have you NEVER heard anybody complain that 'since I was a lad' accents
&gt;&gt; and speech have got more American? In other words, is it not a common
&gt;&gt; phenomenon that what people are constantly exposed to, they imitate?
&gt; Rita, please say this isn't so! And how can it be so, since there is
&gt; no one &quot;American&quot; accent, but instead many regional accents in the
&gt; United States. I'm sure Our Ever-Posting Poet Bob Grumman would find
&gt; my Philadelphia accent as amusing as I would find his Southern accent.
&gt; And we would both be amused to hear the New Englander David Webb say
&gt;&quot;park my car in Harvard Yard&quot;.

"/>

I'm afraid that my accent would be a disappointment. I grew up in
the southern Appalachians and presumably had at least some of the
regional &quot;hillbilly&quot; accent when I was growing up. Although I quickly
lost the accent when I moved north as an adult, the academic milieu in
which I spend most of my time is such a melting pot of regional origins
and speech patterns that I have not acquired the local &quot;old Vermonter&quot;
pronunciation (not yet, at any rate).

However, I recall a close friend of mine who grew up in a small town
in Maine describing his wonder on first traveling as far south as rural
northern Pennsylvania for the first time and hearing what seemed to him
an exotic southern accent in the speech of the locals. I had exactly
the same experience when I went as far north as rural northern
Pennsylvania for first time, but I marveled at the exotic NORTHERN
speech I was hearing.

&gt; All irrelevant. Why are you appealing to my sense of humour, or some
&gt; mythical 'hundreds of time' when I must have heard the phrase in
&gt; modern times? Paul, nobody cares about how people used it in the 20th
&gt; century. What has that got to do with Nashe, writing in the 16th?

"/>

Because we were not present when Nashe
used it in the 16th century. We have to
guess at the meaning from what we know
of human behaviour, and particularly that
of the literate English classes. Most of that
must necessarily come from our experience
in the 20th century. I'd like to have a time
machine as much as you. But I don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To Elizabethans 'vulgar sort' meant 'common people'.

In plain didactic speech that is indeed what
it usually meant. But, as we know from
modern experience, such terms are used
much more frequently in jest -- when they
nearly always refer the next social layer
down from where the speaker claims to be
at any particular moment. You may claim
that such jests were unknown in the 16th
century. Perhaps that is your claim. Or
maybe you claim that, even though class
distinctions were present at the time, no one
ever referred to them -- from embarrassment
or some other reason? Is that your claim?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How can you pretend it ever meant 'aspiring middle class'?

"/>

In this context, that is clearly the social
layer indicated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; Such phrases have to be read in context.
&gt;&gt; This does not sound in the least humorous.
&gt;&gt; Whereas almost everything by Nashe must
&gt;&gt; first assumed to be so.

&gt; No, don't assume. It's sloppy. Yes, Nashe generally writes with a
&gt; great deal of dash and humour. But he also sometimes writes plainly,
&gt; and occasionally even solemnly. You can only work out which by
&gt; looking at the context. You can never do what you admitted to above,
&gt; think 'Oh I know how this guy writes, so I can comment on what he said
&gt; without even bothering to read it'. Tut tut.

"/>

When you know an author fairly well, and
when the use is obvious, you can often make
a pretty good guess. For example, if Oxford
(as Shakespeare) was to refer in his sonnets
to, say, 'a scurvy knave' -- then there's a
pretty good chance that he means Ralegh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; We have to interpret the words in
&gt;&gt; something like my way, because the
&gt;&gt; pedestrian interpretation makes no sense.

&gt; It makes perfect sense. Nashe is talking about the impact of sudden
&gt; exposure to good dramatic poetry on people who previously heard

Do you see the new words and new forms

Bradley quoted no evidence, as far as I can
see. Since he wasn't there and didn't hear any
accents, and has no reasonable way of
working out what they might have been, it's
damned hard to see what 'evidence' in this
area can be thought to count as good.

There is a persistent and curious aspect of
academic 'thinking' -- present, it seems to me,
at almost all times, of imagining that the class
distinctions of the current day are, in some
way, unnatural or transient. And that in a
'more simple and straightforward' past, they
did not exist. Or that, if they did exist, they
did so in a 'healthier' manner -- with fewer of
the 'obnoxious' or more obvious aspects of
the present distinctions.

Someone should do a thesis on this. It would
not be too difficult, in practice. You'd just
have to go through all writings on class
distinction over the past few hundred years.
In fact, has anyone done it at all? There's
probably not much in the historical record,
as -- in Anglo-Saxon countries, at least, and
probably in all others -- the topic is
embarrassing. Lower classes exist, and are
human, but are definitely, in some indefinable
way, 'lesser beings'. Few will want to say
that out loud; yet every aspect of nearly
everyone's behaviour will confirm it.

I am sure that the idea is common in university

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Within living memory all born members of the elite have spoken with

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; though apparently it was becoming so.

Sure, and in the second half of the 14th century,
when they began to use less and less French,
and more and more English, the aristocrats spoke
exactly like the barrow-boys in the street -- no
matter which part of the country it was. Yeah,
that makes sense.

So when the court assembled in London for,
say, the coronation of Richard II, they would
have had great difficulty in understanding
each other. And Chaucer would have spoken
in exactly the same way as London Cockneys
of his day, and his works would only have
been successful with Londoners -- whether
commoners or aristocrats.

Ah, it all begins to make sense.

Let's continue with your theory (presumably
this is the standard one of modern academe --
if rarely articulated). In the 15th and early
16th century, these unfortunate class
distinctions in society (if only they had had
the sense to abolish them all at the time)
began to affect Londoners, and the upper
classes began to adopt their own form of
speech (which was presumably followed, to
some extent, by aristocrats in the country).
But THEN the poets arrived. And on
account of their great work, the lower
classes in London began to speak proper.
This better speech spread to the lower
classes of other parts of the country.
(Nashe tells us so, and he can't be wrong.)
So all was well in English society -- for a
time. But then, something nasty was found
in the woodshed . . . . . Do you happen to
know what it was?

Ah, how I miss academe! You can spin
any kind of bullshit you like, and it will
be believed -- so long as it seems to match
a politically correct paradigm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There have always been a lot of Scots in Canada, which is the reason for
the &quot;hoose&quot; pronunciation. It is, however, somewhat more subtle than
that; I've never heard anyone actually pronounce &quot;house&quot; to rhyme
perfectly with &quot;goose&quot;.

It is common in Canada, and one of the two best markers of a Canadian.
The other is &quot;Eh?&quot;, but I know that I grew up saying &quot;Eh?&quot; in central
Maine in the 50's, quite some distance from the Canadian border (and
even further from English-speaking Canada), so I'd say it's less
reliable than &quot;hoose&quot;.

people pronouncing 'house' as 'hoose' or 'about' as 'aboot'.
Perhaps we simply move in different circles.

More probably in different generations. It would be pointless to
contradict a native British Columbian. I lived there twenty five
years ago so the pronunciation must now be extinct, except among a few
oldies like my friend. It was a subtle and unique sound and I'm sorry
it's gone. But there you go - accents do change over time.

&gt;&gt; All irrelevant. Why are you appealing to my sense of humour, or some

&gt;&gt; modern times? Paul, nobody cares about how people used it in the 20th
&gt;&gt; century. What has that got to do with Nashe, writing in the 16th?

&gt; Because we were not present when Nashe
&gt; used it in the 16th century. We have to
&gt; guess at the meaning from what we know
&gt; of human behaviour, and particularly that
&gt; of the literate English classes.

"/>

No we don't have to guess. We have Nashe's evidence. It is neither a
long nor a difficult passage, and the semantic shift in the words he
uses is not great. And what you know of 'the literate English classes'

Examples, Paul.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But, as we know from
&gt; modern experience, such terms are used
&gt; much more frequently in jest -- when they
&gt; nearly always refer the next social layer

&gt; that such jests were unknown in the 16th
&gt; century. Perhaps that is your claim. Or
&gt; maybe you claim that, even though class
&gt; distinctions were present at the time, no one
&gt; ever referred to them -- from embarrassment

My claim is I can't find an example of an Elizabethan using 'vulgar
sort' to mean 'aspiring middle class'. Can you? Is that your claim?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How can you pretend it ever meant 'aspiring middle class'?

&gt; In this context, that is clearly the social

Show me by quoting other examples of the usage. Or is Nashe unique,
is he the one Elizabethan ever born who used 'vulgar sort' to mean
'aspiring middle class'? Is that your claim?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Such phrases have to be read in context.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This does not sound in the least humorous.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whereas almost everything by Nashe must
&gt;&gt;&gt; first assumed to be so.

&gt;&gt; No, don't assume. It's sloppy.
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; When you know an author fairly well, and
&gt; when the use is obvious, you can often make
&gt; a pretty good guess. For example, if Oxford
&gt; (as Shakespeare) was to refer in his sonnets
&gt; to, say, 'a scurvy knave' -- then there's a
&gt; pretty good chance that he means Ralegh.

Folks, I rest my case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have to interpret the words in
&gt;&gt;&gt; something like my way, because the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pedestrian interpretation makes no sense.

&gt;&gt; It makes perfect sense. Nashe is talking about the impact of sudden
&gt;&gt; exposure to good dramatic poetry on people who previously heard
&gt;&gt; nothing like it. How on earth could it have no impact at all?

&gt; Who says it had no impact at all?

So exactly what impact do you imagine it had, if you deny it affected
their speech?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We are talking about your claim that
&gt; poetry made illiterate Londoners speak

No - we are talking about Nashe's claim. '...they(i.e. poets) haue

London...to aspire to a richer puritie of speach, than is communicated

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Can you see Dirty Den attending the Globe

Why do you continually appeal to modern examples? Is your picture of
Elizabethan England simply a costume version of the England of the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; What we want is a movement of self-

&gt; for you?

&gt;&gt; An awareness of how actors pronounce words
&gt;&gt; clearly would rub off too, and if the more impressionable also
&gt;&gt; imitated the speech of actors they idolized, it wouldn't surprise me.

&gt; Go on then, give us some real historical

Well, there's this passage in Nashe: . '...they(i.e. poets) haue

for you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And it's you who characterise such speech as 'posh', applying the
&gt;&gt; class consciousness of the 20th century to the 16th. It's true
&gt;&gt; English society has always been class-ridden, but not always in
&gt;&gt; exactly the same way.

&gt; Sure, and class was thought of in a completely
&gt; different manner in the 16th century.

"/>

Different. Not completely, but different. It's different now from
what it was when I was a girl, when few people in public life dared
speak as, for example, Prescott does. But it's still a class-ridden
society. I think the basics stay but the markers shift.

&gt; Let's continue with your theory (presumably

&gt; distinctions in society (if only they had had
&gt; the sense to abolish them all at the time)
&gt; began to affect Londoners, and the upper
&gt; classes began to adopt their own form of
&gt; speech (which was presumably followed, to
&gt; some extent, by aristocrats in the country).
&gt; But THEN the poets arrived. And on
&gt; account of their great work, the lower
&gt; classes in London began to speak proper.
&gt; This better speech spread to the lower
&gt; classes of other parts of the country.
&gt; (Nashe tells us so, and he can't be wrong.)

Inattentive, Paul. Nashe compliments London as being 'the fountain

&gt;&gt; another question: how can someone insane or a child, as Rita must be,
&gt;&gt; make your arguments (I almost said, &quot;you!&quot;) look so incredibly stupid?

&gt; Hey, Rita

&gt; Bob Grumman agrees with you. And he
&gt; feels obliged to take Bassanio's casket
&gt; speech in MoV as straight.

&gt; I rest my case.

Hey, that's nothing, Paul. I take Hamlet's ode to masturbation that
begins, &quot;Oh, that this too too solid flesh/ would melt, thaw, resolve
itself into a dew,&quot; straight, too, (except for the nice pun of a
dew/adieu, although as a Strat I can't reveal that because it means he
was tutored for ten or more years in French).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All irrelevant. Why are you appealing to my sense of humour, or some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mythical 'hundreds of time' when I must have heard the phrase in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern times? Paul, nobody cares about how people used it in the 20th
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; century. What has that got to do with Nashe, writing in the 16th?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because we were not present when Nashe
&gt;&gt;&gt; used it in the 16th century. We have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; guess at the meaning from what we know
&gt;&gt;&gt; of human behaviour, and particularly that
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the literate English classes.

&gt;&gt; No we don't have to guess. We have Nashe's evidence. It is neither a
&gt;&gt; long nor a difficult passage, and the semantic shift in the words he
&gt;&gt; uses is not great. And what you know of 'the literate English classes'
&gt;&gt; seems confined to personal contemporary experience.

&gt; I agree -- its meaning is quite unambiguous
&gt; -- when we rule out the possibility of all
&gt; humour and irony. I'm fully aware that's the
&gt; only way in which academics and yanks
&gt; (like Grumman) can read the line -- or any
&gt; line in any text.

"/>

No use telling Paul that I've shown many times in posts to him that
I'm capable of reading SOME lines in more than one way. Or that my
one book is called OF MANYWHERE-AT-ONCE, and promotes the idea that
poetry's greatest virtue is its ability to put a reader in more than
one place at once. He seems to have some psychological . . . trait
that causes him to generalize from ONE instance of a person's saying a
= x when he holds that a is unequal to x that the person believes
everything in the class of which a is a member = x. But I feel like
mentioning one refutation of his argument: in my poetry sequence,
&quot;Mathemaku for Beethoven,&quot; I use the word &quot;explainability&quot; with &quot;May&quot;
as its exponent, and I fully intend &quot;May&quot; to be read as both the month
and permission. (The poem is in the recent anthology, ANOTHER SOUTH,
which you can probably purchase from Amazon if you want to check my
veracity, Paul.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I am disappointed with
&gt; you, especially since it's in Nashe, and you
&gt; claim to know him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of that
&gt;&gt;&gt; must necessarily come from our experience
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the 20th century. I'd like to have a time

&gt;&gt; You have. It's the surviving historical record. Trust it,
&gt;&gt; even when it tells you something that surprises you.

&gt; Wonderful. Rita's rule -- forget all humour
&gt; and irony when reading Nashe. That way
&gt; you can't go wrong.

"/>

Rita finds an a that does not equal x, a passage in Nashe that is to
be taken seriously; Paul disagrees with her; therefore, Rita believes
that all the members of the class a is in, passages in Nashe, equal x,
or are to be taken seriously.

SNIP of Paul's continued floundering against Rita.

That's hyperbole. Irony is when words imply the opposite of what is
stated. If you think Nashe is being ironic when he says the lower

he really means they speak worse English than elsewhere. And your
evidence for that is surprising suggestion is..?

You mean you personally don't believe that attending plays regularly
could have an impact on people who had previously never heard blank

Right. The only people allowed into the public theatres were

You don't have to ignorant or stupid to take a statement from Nashe
seriously; as you (may) know, he makes a lot of factual statements.
So Paul, you still have to show - probably by citing historical
evidence, I'm afraid - that in this case Nashe was being sarcastic,
ironic or humorously hyperbolic. You haven't come close yet.

For the same reasons as the vast majority
of other fathers in his town up to that time
(and for some time thereafter) did not make
sure their sons learned to read and write
(a) they had not learned themselves and
did not see the necessity;
(b) many of them would probably have felt
personally shamed if their sons were
acquired abilities they never had;
(c) they did not think it appropriate to their
class and to the role they occupied in
society;
(d) they could not afford the money and
time;
(e) they were afraid that inappropriate
education would distract their sons from
the business of making a living
(f) and so on and on . . . . .

How come that when education (in the west)
is largely free today, so many millions do so
little to take all the advantages that it can bring?

You really need to see the class system of
England in operation. English people seem
to reject almost every effort that is made
to get them to move up in class. Often that
means rejecting educational opportunities
-- even when free.
