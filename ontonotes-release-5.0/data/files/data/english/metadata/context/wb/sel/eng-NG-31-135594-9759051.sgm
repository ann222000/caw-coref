I am trying to print out the weeks in possesion in a format of 1.5 3.1
and the like.

--------------------
weeksInPosession = (daysKeyed % 7);

System.out.println(%.2f, weeksInPosession);
--------------------

However I keep getting the following error message:

')' expected
- System.out.println(%.2f, weeksInPosession);

Can someone please inform me of what I need to do?

Thanks in advance.

Review the Javadocs!  The Javadocs usually have the answer:
&lt; http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html#printl... )&gt;

There is no version println() that takes two arguments.  Also, '%.2f' is not a
legal Java expression.

Perhaps you wanted

You need to put your format string in quotes,
System.out.println(&quot;%.2f&quot;, weeksInPossesion);

However, I don't think % does what you expect it to do.

This is not a legal call.  PrintStream's println() method only takes zero or
one arguments.

Check into the Javadoc links mentioned upthread.

Note that Roedy is directing you to the printf() method, not the println() method.

The angels see it better
still, and from a more distant time.

286. Those who believe without having read the Testaments, do so because
they have an inward disposition entirely holy, and all that they hear of our
religion conforms to it. They feel that a God has made them; they desire
only to love God; they desire to hate themselves only. They feel that they
have no strength in themselves; that they are incapable of coming to God;
and that if God does not come to them, they can have no communion with Him.
And they hear our religion say that men must love God only, and hate self
only; but that, all being corrupt and unworthy of God, God made Himself man
to unite Himself to us. No more is required to persuade men who have this
disposition in their heart, and who have this knowledge of their duty and of
their inefficiency.

287. Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge of the
prophets and evidences, nevertheless judge of their religion as well as
those who have that knowledge. They judge of it by the heart, as others
judge of it by the intellect. God himself inclines them to believe, and thus
they are most effectively convinced.

I confess indeed that one of those Christians who believe without proofs
will not, perhaps, be capable of convincing an infidel who will say the same
of himself. But those who know the proofs of religion will prove without
difficulty that such a believer is truly inspired by God, though he cannot
prove it himself.

For God having said in His prophecies (which are undoubtedly prophecies)
that in the reign of Jesus Christ He would spread His spirit abroad among
nations, and that the youths and maidens and children of the Church would
prophesy; it is certain that the Spirit of God is in these and not in the
others.

of these disorders thenceforward, which has continued ever since.

Presently after this, there began to appear a remarkable religious
concern at a little village belonging to the congregation called
Pascommuck, where a few families were settled, at about three miles
distance from the main body of the town. At this place, a number of
persons seemed to be savingly wrought upon. In the April following, anno
1734, there happened a very sudden and awful death of a young man in the
bloom of his youth; who being violently seized with a pleurisy, and
taken immediately very delirious, died in about two days; which
(together with what was preached publicly on that occasion) much
affected many young people. This was followed with another death of a
young married woman, who had been considerably exercised in mind, about
the salvation of her soul, before she was ill, and was in great distress
in the beginning of her illness; but seemed to have satisfying evidences
of God's mercy to her, before her death; so that she died very full of
comfort, in a most earnest and moving manner warning and counselling
others. This seemed to contribute to render solemn the spirits of many
young persons; and there began evidently to appear more of a religious
concern on people's minds.

In the fall of the year I proposed it to the young people, that they
should agree among themselves to spend the evenings after lectures in
social religion, and to that end divide themselves into several
companies to meet in various parts of the town; which was accordingly
done, and those meetings have been since continued, and

the natural order of things during so long a
space of years, they have nevertheless been preserved (and this preservation
has been foretold); and extending from the earliest times to the latest,
their history comprehends in its duration all our histories which it
preceded by a long time.

The law by which this people is governed is at once the most ancient law in
the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has been always observed
without a break in a state. This is what Josephus admirably proves, Against
Apion, and also Philo the Jew, in different places, where they point out
that it is so ancient that the very name of law was only known by the oldest
nation more than a thousand years afterwards; so that Homer, who has written
the history of so many states, has never used the term. And it is easy to
judge of its perfection by simply reading it; for we see that it has
provided for all things with so great wisdom, equity, and judgement, that
the most ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some knowledge of
it, have borrowed from it their principal laws; this is evident from what
are called the Twelve Tables, and from the other proofs which Josephus
gives.

But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of all in
respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people, in order to
keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and painful observances, on
pain of death. Whence it is very astonishing that it has been constantly
preserved during many centuries by a people, rebellious and impatient as
this one was; while all other states have changed their laws from time to
time, although these were far more lenient

time of health that ever I knew since I have been in the
town. We ordinarily have several bills put up, every Sabbath, for sick
persons; but now we had not so much as one for many sabbaths together.
But after this it seemed to be otherwise.

When this work of God appeared to be at its greatest height, a poor weak
man who belongs to the town, being in great spiritual trouble, was
hurried with violent temptations to cut his own throat, and made an
attempt, but did not do it effectually. He, after this, continued a
considerable time exceedingly overwhelmed with melancholy; but has not
for a long time been very greatly delivered, by the light of God's
countenance lifted up upon him, and has expressed a great sense of his
sin in so far yielding to temptation; and there are in him all hopeful
evidences of his having been made a subject of saving mercy.

In the latter part of May, it began to be very sensible that the Spirit
of God was gradually withdrawing from us, and after this time Satan
seemed to be more let loose, and raged in a dreadful manner. The first
instance wherein it appeared, was a person putting an end to his own
life by cutting his throat. He was a gentleman of more than common
understanding, of strict morals, religious in his behavior, and a useful
and honorable person in the town; but was of a family that are
exceedingly prone to the disease of melancholy, and his mother was
killed with it. He had, from the beginning of this extraordinary time,
been exceeding

fame, diversion, and
the thought of the future? But take away diversion, and you will see them
dried up with weariness. They feel then their nothingness without knowing
it; for it is indeed to be unhappy to be in insufferable sadness as soon as
we are reduced to thinking of self and have no diversion.

165. Thoughts.--In omnibus requiem quaesivi.21 If our condition were truly
happy, we not need diversion from thinking of it in order to make ourselves
happy.

166. Diversion.--Death is easier to bear without thinking of it than is the
thought of death without peril.

167. The miseries of human life has established all this: as men have seen
this, they have taken up diversion.

168. Diversion.--As men are not able to fight against death, misery,
ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to
think of them at all.

169. Despite these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and only wishes to be
happy, and cannot wish not to be so. But how will he set about it? To be
happy he would have to make himself immortal; but, not being able to do so,
it has occurred to him to prevent himself from thinking of death.

170. Diversion.--If man were happy, he would be the more so, the less he was
diverted, like the Saints and God. Yes; but is it not to be happy to have a
faculty of being amused by diversion? No; for that comes from elsewhere and
from without, and thus is dependent, and therefore subject to be disturbed
by a thousand accidents, which bring inevitable griefs.

171. Misery.--The only thing which consoles us for our miseries is
diversion, and yet this is the greatest of our miseries. For it is this
which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves and which makes
us insensibly ruin ourselves. Without this we should be in a state of
weariness, and this weariness would spur us to seek a more solid means of
escaping from it. But diversion amuses us, and leads us unconsciously to
death.

172. We do no

sun,&quot; that this is said. We do not say that those who seek the noonday sun,
or water in the sea, shall find them; and hence the evidence of God must not
be of this nature. So it tells us elsewhere: Vere tu es Deus absconditus.31

243. It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made use of
nature to prove God. They all strive to make us believe in Him. David,
Solomon, etc., have never said, &quot;There is no void, therefore there is a
God.&quot; They must have had more knowledge than the most learned people who
came after them, and who have all made use of this argument. This is worthy
of attention.

244. &quot;Why! Do you not say yourself that the heavens and birds prove God?&quot;
No. &quot;And does your religion not say so&quot;? No. For although it is true in a
sense for some souls to whom God gives this light, yet it is false with
respect to the majority of men.

245. There are three sources of belief: reason, custom, inspiration. The
Christian religion, which alone has reason, does not acknowledge as her true
children those who believe without inspiration. It is not that she excludes
reason and custom. On the contrary, the mind

Sheer disruption. He's been doing it on rec.arts.books.tolkien for
months, and now he's A) increasing the number of his attacks, B) moving
into other groups, and C) growing more sophisticated, using legit users
of his target groups as &quot;From&quot; and inserting his crap into legit
threads. Make no mistake about it, this is a premeditated attempt to
destroy USENET.

Unfortunately, ab ... @rr.com ignores everything sent to them. I'm afraid
a compaign is going to have to start to have RoadRunner's servers
disconnected from USENET until this guy is reported to the authorities
and placed in either a prison or a mental institution. (Not all of his
splurge comes through RoadRunner, but it seems to be his favorite.)
