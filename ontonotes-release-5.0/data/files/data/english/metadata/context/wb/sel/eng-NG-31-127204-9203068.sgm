7 dead in Finland school shooting
=================================
Nov 07, 2007 10:08 AM
Associated press

TUUSULA, Finland – An 18-year-old man opened fire at a high school in
southern Finland on Wednesday, killing at least seven people, officials
said.

&quot;It's at least seven dead,&quot; medical response leader Eero Hirvensalo said.

One person was &quot;severely injured&quot; while 10 people had minor injuries,
Hirvensalo told The Associated Press.
=======================================
One killed, three wounded in Finland school shooting
Sami Torma , Reuters
Published: Wednesday, November 07, 2007

TUUSULA, Finland (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and three
injured in a school shooting in southern Finland on Wednesday, hours
after a video was posted on YouTube predicting a massacre at school.

One of those shot was the principal of the school, said Tuula Panula,
spokeswoman for the Tuusula municipality, some 60 km (40 miles) from the
Finnish capital Helsinki.

The video, set to hard-driving music, shows a still photo of a school
that appears to be Jokela High School, where the shooting occurred. The
photo then fragments to reveal a red-tinted photo of a man pointing a
gun at the camera.

It is entitled &quot;Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007&quot; and was posted
by a user called Sturmgeist89. &quot;Sturmgeist&quot; means storm spirit in German.

A teacher at the scene told Reuters the gunman was a pupil at the school.

&quot;It felt unreal, a pupil I have taught myself was running towards me,
screaming, a pistol in his hand,&quot; teacher Kim Kiuru, who was teaching
his grade 8 class when the shooting took place, told Reuters at the scene.

&quot;He (the gunman) was moving systematically through the school hallways,
knocking on the doors and shooting through the doors,&quot; added Kiuru, who
said he helped his pupils escape the building through the classroom windows.

Junior Constable Olli Laine said police had surrounded the building,
which houses both a middle school and high school, and were evacuating
students.

Despite having the third-largest per capita ratio of handgun ownership
in the world, violent incidents are rare at Finnish schools.

According to Finnish media, there have been four stabbings at schools
since 1999, but none of these caused fatalities.

The last major attack in the country came in 2002, when a young man
killed including himself and six others, in a bomb blast at a shopping
mall in Helsinki.

Their columnists will probably find a way to blame it on the US. Violent
movies/tv, the violence culture and so on (there's some truth there in that
violence sells to *all* audiences and most internationally-viewed films are
made here) coupled with implications that this country is so violent that
there are shootings on every street corner on practically every day of the
week.

The Markkus of this world will eat it all up and embellish even further. I
wouldn't be surprised if the Iraq War came into the picture and of course
Bush, who is definitely, absolutely, positively not so indirectly responsible.

Remember the German school tragedy a few years ago and how many in their media
responded in their 'analysis' pieces and even in some of their 'hard news'
broadcasts and rag stories? Plus ca change. Placing the blame elsewhere is
human, sure. But so often blaming this country for everything under the sun is
unabashedly political. Nex

When ever those timid Americans ask something about a destination
abroad, the first question is almost invariably: is it safe to travel
there? By safety they always mean that how probable it is that someone
physically attacks them. It is rather odd. Why only Americans are so
worried about it.

Actually, your cognition skills are lacking; maybe YOU should be
speech-writing for GWB.

Here is how intelligent people parse Markku's post:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;When ever those timid Americans ask something about a destination
&gt;&gt;&gt;abroad, the first question is almost invariably: is it safe to travel
&gt;&gt;&gt;there?
">

Note that he said &quot;timid&quot; Americans. Not &quot;all&quot; Americans or even just
&quot;Americans&quot;. He was referring to those cowed, TV-raised idiots who
have been brainwashed into thinking the US is a wonderland of
tolerance and safety, while European countries are likely havens for
swarthy, knife-wielding, socialist junkies needing cash for a fix.

These types of ignorant Americans do exist. For proof, please do read
the RTE archives at your leisure. Fortunately (and I'm sure Marrku
agrees), most Americans are aware that they are statistically more
likely to suffer from violent crime in the US than in any European
country. Most Americans enjoy traveling to Europe in this knowledge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;By safety they always mean that how probable it is that someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;physically attacks them. It is rather odd. Why only Americans are so
&gt;&gt;&gt;worried about it.
">

Here, Marrku is simply stating an open-ended question, albeit perhaps
with a small barb. The open-ended question is &quot;What causes timidity
and misinformation in some Americans?&quot; and the tiny barb is &quot;Europeans
don't have the same outlook, so something must be polluted in American
society&quot;.

And guess what? He's right! Compared to our European forebears,
Americans tend to be less informed, more religious and less worldly.
It's not true across the boards, but it is a noticable difference in
our cultures.

I'm not Marrku's gay boyfriend, and I'm not his sockpuppet. He may
very well have made other posts that are clearly anti-American. I
don't read his posts often enough to know. But the post that was
quoted as &quot;proof&quot; of his anti-Americanism falls short of the mark.

BTW: if you frothing pro-American Americans (I'm just a plain ole'
American myself) want to read a really good book about European
Anti-Americanism, pick up &quot;Uncouth Nation: Why Europe Dislikes
America&quot; by Andrei S Markovits. He has many good points (especially
the synergy of right-wing Europeans hating America for being too
tolerant and left-wing Europeans hating America for being too
intolerant), but he too often whitewashes valid points that some
Europeans make about the loud, brash people across the pond.

All in all, a good read.

His catch phrase would be &quot;hebbe faggot&quot;, or something. I think this
means a fag jew, but I'm not sure.

Either way, it's not such an effective insult.

Mea culpa: I am wont to criticize my compatriots. In my own defense, I
tend to be skeptical of the vast bulk of humanity (or, as I call them,
the &quot;perfumed hogs&quot;), so groaning about the state of American culture
comes naturally.

But this book is not a hatchet job on Americans. On the contrary: it
is a stinging rebuke of elitist European anti-Americanism. While it's
not blustery enough to satisfy the patriotic appetite of the
flag-wavers, it is a daring defense of America in the face of some
serious heat from overseas. America has been the whipping boy of
European intellectuals long before any Bush took office, and America
will continue to weather this vitriol long after the Bushes are dead
and gone. Even if America rescinded the Declaration of Independence,
declared allegiance to the Crown and flew the Union Jack over the
White House, there would still be murmurings about how &quot;those bloody
yanks&quot; are too rich and have too many poor, are too licentious and
Puritanical, are foolishly independent and rigidly conformist, make
barbaric music and are laughably conservative, are too proud of their
amazing accomplishments yet owe everything to their European
forebears.

Just like Americans often miscalculate Europe, Europeans often miss
the point about America. What I love about this place is the goddamn
chaos. Our fearlessness in expressing ourselves makes the place
interesting. Unfortunately, our conservative brothers are determined
to continually check this uninhibited &quot;joie de vivre&quot;.

I think Jack Nicholson said it best in &quot;Easy Rider&quot;:

&quot;Oh, yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you
about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it's gonna
scare 'em.&quot;

I do wonder just how much of this European anti-American is purely
imagined. IME apart from the universal contempt of the Iraq mess,
Europeans don't have any great beef with the USA.

Again, I think Americans have an idea about freedom which isn't
particularly tangible. I can name a number of freedoms that can be
enjoyed in Europe that can't be in the USA. It also goes vice versa.

We could make a list of freedoms on both sides, but I'd say they would
balance each other out.
