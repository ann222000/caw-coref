So that the US guys also know that they need to update their filters ;)

Dear colleagues

APNIC received IPv4 address blocks 121/8 and 122/7 from IANA in January
2006 and will be making allocations from these ranges in the near future.

This announcement is being made for the information of the Internet
community so that network configurations such as routing filters
may be updated as appropriate.

For more information on the resources administered by APNIC, see:

http://www.apnic.net/db/ranges.html

For information on the minimum allocation sizes within address ranges
administered by APNIC, see:

http://www.apnic.net/db/min-alloc.html

Kind regards

Son

Next time can we have this announcement from IANA or at least from
APNIC person directly to this list please?

To be fair they did change and listed new ranges in
http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space
so I'm doing the same for
http://www.completewhois.com/iana-ipv4-addresses.txt

---

And FYI - situation with availability of IPv4 space is not looking that
good. There is now only 29 blocks left (92/8 - 120/8) in the pool from
which IANA is giving blocks to APNIC &amp; RIPE and they are using 3 blocks
per year each so this is enough for 5 years or less.

In the block given to ARIN (63/8 and up to 79/8), it'll be most likely
all allocated by end of 2006 (77/8 - 79/8 left). The only other large
block of /8s left is 173/8 - 188/8, which would be enough for ARIN for
5 years as well.

What is left is trying to reuse space left unallocated from Class-B
pool of 128/8 - 172/8 which has around 5 /8 blocks worth of space
not allocated (total of 308448 /24s when you sum up data I have at
http://www.completewhois.com/statistics/ip_statistics.htm ). As well
there are a dozen additional non-allocated /8 blocks scattered
around the pool (1/8, 2/8, 7/8, 23/8, 27/8, 31/8, 36/8, 37/8, 38/8,
42/8, 49/8, 50/8). which all together would add up to extra 2 years
but likely less then that considering need for space by LACNIC &amp;
AFRINIC and possibly increases in pace of allocations by 3 big
ip registries as users change to using broadband and having
connection 24/7 and access internet from their cell phones...

What we're left with is that IANA will run out of space (*) to give
to RIRs in about 7-8 years (with RIRs having then enough space to
last about 1-2 more years), i.e doomsday in around 2015!

So we should all really work on accelerating IPv6 adaption in all
the regions (and unfortunately myself, I'm not seeing enough interest
in it from business/corporate consulting work).

* - Class-E space of 240/8 - 255/8 can also possibly to be used as
last resort case, that would postpone the end by another year or 2

"/> IANA would be happy to announce allocations to mailing lists if
people want to suggest which mailing lists would be appropriate.
Please send mail to me directly and I'll summarize.

"/> Why? Anyone can post anything they like. I think this is more
of an education issue i.e. &quot;@iana.org&quot; is the authoritative source
and use at any other announcement at your own risk.

So if you read it from @iana.org and you agree it's from them, trust
it. If it's from any other source, do not trust it. For our region,
I think we'd want to trust ARIN and IANA. IANA for outside ARIN
region allocations, and ARIN for in.
