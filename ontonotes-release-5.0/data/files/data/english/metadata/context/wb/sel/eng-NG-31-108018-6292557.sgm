Been washing Calphalon and Wusthof in dishwasher

So yeah I've been washing my Calphalon anodized aluminum pot and pans in the
dishwasher as well as my Wusthof knives for years and have never had any
problems.  Then I start reading here and everybody's like "ohhhh it will
make the universe explode if you do that."  I have a Calphalon pan that's
too big for the dishwasher that I always wash by hand and it looks no
different than the one I stick in the dishwasher nearly every day and I got
them at the same time several years ago.  When I wash a quality knife I put
it alone in one of the little utensil compartments so it doesn't clatter
against other objects and I put it point down so the handle isn't super
close to the heating element but other than that I do nothing out of the
ordinary.  I put the pots and pans on the top rack.  I never use heated
drying.  But that's it.  I think a lot of people here really tend to
over-pamper their stuff.  If you have to baby merchandise you bought from
the store then you should be buying cheaper stuff.

I personally have a number of pieces of hard anodized Calphalon,
including one piece that accidentally went through the dishwasher when
an ex-semi-girlfriend loaded it and I can assure you that while still
useable, it does indeed look different than the others now. I don't use
heated dry either BTW. If you have particularly acidic water strong
enough to counter the very alkaline dishwasher detergent, or use a
particularly mild detergent you may have gotten lucky.

I won't own everyday cookware that can't go into the dishwasher. The
only time I don't wash my pots in the dishwasher is if they're too big.
Knives are another matter totally and I will continue to hand wash them.

that's nuts I can't imagine that.  Here's the thing though, if you have
"acidic water" wouldn't that come out of the tap that you use for hand
washing too?

I'm looking at these two pots right now and one is a little more scratched
and scraped from being used more often, but the finish itself looks no
different.

Oh I also use Calgon water softener mixed in with the detergent I don't know
if that makes any difference.

Please also consider that your experience may be a sign that you've got
an exceptionally gentle (or anemic) dishwasher, vs. your other theories.
Believe me, the average dishwasher WILL trash Caphalon.  Big time, and
quickly.  Really.

Having said that, I do have one piece of Caphalon that I absolutely
love, and it gets used every day.  It's a long-handled, stainless steel
slotted spoon with a flat tip.  I use it to clean out the downstairs
kitty litter box.  It is, quite simply, fantastic for this application!
Major kudos to the cat box scoop folks at Caphalon!  I only wish I could
find another one for $5.97 at the Home Goods store where I got this one,
so I'd have another for the upstairs boxes!  Still, as much as I like
this spoon, I *do not* put it in the dishwasher!  :-)

But while they may make fantastic long-handled, flat-tipped, stainless
steel slotted cat box spoons, I wouldn't touch Caphalon pots and pans
with a stick.  Too little performance for too much money, imo.

So it's indeed A Good Thing® that you're enjoying your Caphalon pans,
but they do not take much real abuse at all, in my experience.  You may
actually be pampering yours, just in a different way.

Take care,
Bob

So I was out collecting the latest deposits in the cat box, using my
favorite scoop, and I noticed that "Caphalon" really is "Calphalon"!

Not sure why I omitted the "l", other than it's still Christmas season.

Even then, I'll go for a Sitram or IPAC anytime over the Ca*l*phalon.
At Home Goods you've got to grab it when you see it, but except for the
ong-handled, stainless, flat-tipped, slotted pooper-scoopers, my
grabbers pretty much shut down when I see Ca*l*phalon.

As usual, YMMV.

It might, if it prevents the ionic reaction that pits the
anodized aluminum.

But without looking up the reaction and the process
of water softening I couldn't say right now that
it shouldn't be doing the opposite...

It's not the power of the washer that does it.

It's contact with certain ionic solutions.

His water composition and detergent may be interacting to
create a solution that doesn't pit the anodized aluminum.

But he also says it's scratched.  You can't scratch
anodized aluminum with normal household utensils.  So
maybe instead of pitting it, he's just softened it.

Bob, I am curious about the IPAC cookware.  What type do you prefer
since there are many choices on their website
http://www.ipacitaly.it/prodotti_eng.html and since IMHA I am a huge
SCANPAN fan, I was wondering about the attraction to these products.
Tell me more about the Sitram too if you have time.  Thanks, Kate

ps, I never ever wash any pans or knives (other than steak) in my
dishwasher! I guess I will always have dishpan hands!

Sure, it *could* go into the dishwasher, because, as you note, it's
stainless steel.  BUT, alas, its life as a cat box scoop trumps other
considerations.  When it gets cleaned, it gets hosed off out in
driveway, just like the cat boxes themselves.

I have various pieces of both Sitram and IPAC stainless steel cookware,
all of which I've purchased at a local "Home Goods" store.

You never know what you're going to find (or not find) at these places,
given that they sell off overstocked, bought-out, reconditioned,
cosmetically second-quality merchandise and the like, that they acquire
from who-knows-where.  But they have a lot of very nice quality cookware
and gadgetry mixed in with a bit of junk.  If you're careful, you can
find great bargains.  Same goes for their other departments, afaik.

I don't see the IPAC pots that I have shown on the IPAC web site, so
it's a safe bet that they were discontinued at some point in the past.
Thus their availability at Home Goods.

Both the IPAC and Sitram have welded handles and encapsulated disk
bottoms, both of which I favor.  They're nicely made, imo, and at Home
Goods prices (sometimes marked down further for clearance) they're
bargains.

I don't know what else to tell you.  I don't know what IMHA stands for
(Indiana Manufactured Housing Association?  In My Humble Assessment?),
and I've not use any SCANPAN products.

Hope this helps,
Bob

I just recieved a Calphalon pot for christmas and in it's directions is
say that it is machine washable but that it's appearance could change.
I'm not taking the risk...I know how much the pot cost and can't believe
my MIL bought it for me.

I have Calphalon anodized pots and pans, and only one of them has had a
problem, the small sauce pan.  I ran it in the dishwasher, and bam!
pits and pealing of the anodization.  Calphalon told me that running in
the dishwasher voids the warranty.  They claim they can tell.

The problem isn't necessarilly that it will spoil the finish, but that
it will spoil the warranty.  On the other hand, they tell you to use
scouring powder and a 3M scrubber on it.  It works for me.

I have calphalon, and really like it. One time a pan got into the
dishwasher, and it came out looking like it has a skin disease. Still
cooks the same, but the outside of the pan is disgusting to look at.

Knives, I usually put into the top rack of thedishwasher and have never
had a problem with them.

Yes, the looks of my calphalon pans did change once they'd gone
through the dishwasher; but they still cook the same, so it's not
really a big deal as far as I'm concerned. Knives, however, are a
completely different issue. I =never= put my good knives in the
dishwasher; I'm more than willing to baby them with hand washing!
OTOH, I have a set of cheap steak knives that I run through the
dishwasher without a second thought.

I would be absolutely fascinated to see a photo of somebody's pan that they
think changed because they put it through the dishwasher.  Mine have been
through hundreds of times and look totally fine.

Try sending it in anyway.  I have replaced a few pots with them.  DH
ran mine through the DW too and messed it up.  I wanted to kill him.
But I continued to use ot for a few years and sent it in.  They
replaced it.  They no longer make the Commercial line, though, so
beware that they will substitute the One line if you have Commercial.

My calphalon 12" nonstick skillet went repeatedly into the dishwasher.
It looks vile now.  My new calphalon stock pot isn't going anywhere near it.

The non stick is starting to look like it's peeling and the bottom is
all spotted, stained, dull and powdery looking.  I've learned my lesson.

The one small (about 1 qt.) Calphalon saucepan that we had started
flaking off its finish around the lip of the pan and around the rivets
on the inside of the pan after only one run through the Whirlpool
dishwasher we used to have.  It was only downhill from there.  It looked
positively leprotic after a couple more runs through the Whirlpool,
whereupon we tossed it.  We tried to put it in with the cans and bottles
for recycling, but we found it left in the bin when we hauled it in that
evening.

I think damage to anodized (hard oxidized) aluminum in a
dishwasher is probably due to the highly alkaline nature of some
dishwasher soaps which will dissolve aluminum oxide if only
slowly. Calphalon used to sell a slightly abrasive cleaner for
the pots which would remove persistent deposits if not
accidentally burned-on grease. I haven't seen the cleaner in a
while but it's no great loss since Bon-Ami cleaner seems to work
as well.

Incidentally, it's an observable fact that you *can* scratch
Calphalon pots with utensils :-(

Yes, the highly alkaline dishwasher detergents will strip the anodizing
over time. Add in moderately alkaline water to begin with and the
anodizing doesn't stand a chance in the dishwasher.

The thing to remember of course is that there is plenty of non anodized
cookware out there and in use which works just fine. Indeed the aluminum
self anodizes to some extent, forming a protective aluminum oxide layer.

The main loss that you get when you dishwasher hard anodized Calphalon
is the loss of the extra hard surface so the resulting pan, while
perfectly safe and useable, will scratch more easily.

On my little anodizing line you use sodium hydroxide (lye) to etch the
aluminum before anodizing and also for a longer period to strip old
anodizing if you want to reanodize and dye a different color.

Dormond. Works pretty well.

Yes, hard anodizing is, well, hard, but like anything else it is not
indestructible.

There seems to be a lot of confusion between the different Calphalon
products. The dishwasher issue only applies to those that are hard
anodized, be it fully hard anodized, or hard anodized on the outside and
non stick coated on the inside. It's a simple function of the highly
alkaline detergent dissolving the anodized finish, and it's mostly a
cosmetic issue with the resulting non anodized cookware still being
perfectly safe and functional, just a little less durable.

See example posted on alt.binaries.food

This happened some time ago and the reference pan hasn't had as much use
as the other, but you can clearly see the mottled appearance where the
hard anodize and it's gray dye have been dissolved away leaving just the
underlying aluminum and it's subsequent oxide layer. The tap water here
is somewhere around PH 8.5 or so, I don't have PH test strips that go
high enough to test where the water / dishwasher detergent combo comes
in.

nothing like how mine look and I've put them in the wash the whole time I've

It looks ashy/streaky on the outside now, but the inside is unchanged.
I noticed it after the second or third time through the dishwasher.
