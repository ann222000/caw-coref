On Little Brother's song &quot;Breaking My Heart&quot;, this clown
spits(literally) that &quot;I'ma play fair like rollercoasters and clowns&quot;.
Huh? And this gem, &quot;I'ma turn you on like a personal TV/it's young
Weezy&quot;. What?! I don't blame PackFM when he says he &quot;f*ckin' hates
rappers&quot;. And he uses this clown as proof. I'm just wondering what's the
collective's take on him and what you think makes this guy so hot. And
please, I'd really like to know and don't start with him being &quot;lyrical&quot;
as that boy 'sho 'nuff ain't. I remember people saying Rapper Big Pooh
was wack. Compared to this boy, he's Rakim.

I'm not a huge Lil' Wayne fan, but I think he's doing sort of a gangsta
version of Kool Keith's mid '90s persona or something.  Except Kool
Keith was much funnier and, if you can believe it, more coherent.  I got
that Sex Style unreleased archives CD the other day and reminded me how
on fire Kool Keith was with the hilariously sarcastic stream of
consciousness flow.

Yeah, I dont get it either... I know people that swear this guy is the
best rapper alive and I dont hear it... Granted, I'm not THAT familiar
with his work... I know some of his singles going back to the Hot Boys
days but I've never heard any of his solo albums... I think his
popularity has to do with the fact that he's on so many songs right
now... Every remix seems to have him on it... Kinda like when DMX blew
up, he's on so many songs (albums, mixtapes, singles, etc) it's hard
not to take notice...

Still I dont see the big deal with him... I'm not saying he's horrible
or anything cause he has had verses I've liked (the Black Republican
freestyle) but IMO he's very overrated... And his voice is downright
laughable at times...

I agree with Danger and Quest.

Also who sang that song where you dance by clicking your fingers? THe
one which has a lot of white girls dancing on youtube? What a horrible
song.

Was that Lil' Wayne (please stop saying Weezy, it's more annoying than
calling Rey Mysterio &quot;Rey Rey&quot;), or someone affiliated with him?

1) I don't listen to him at regular speed - slowing him down kills the
squeaky/annoying thing.

2) Check out Carter 1 &amp; 2 Slowed before you judge him on &quot;The Block is
Hot&quot; and &quot;Light's Out&quot;

3) I was a big champion of Wayne for the past four years or so, but
the over saturation is getting to me too.

4) My ferret is named Lil Weezy (or Weezy F. Baby) depending on my
mood.  Ferrets are cousins of weasels, you see!

I agree with everyone in saying that Lil' Wayne is overrated, but I
can't help but to notice how his style and lyrics have changed since
the Hot Boys days.  Then again, I remember going to visit my sister
when she was in college at Grambling State University back in like
96-97, and her then boyfriend (now husband) who was born and raised in
tha N.O., would let me listen to their screw tapes and other stuff
from down bottom.  He played me this one joint, I believe it was
called 'Neighborhood Superstar'.  I don't remember who else was on it,
but I did remember that Lil' Wayne (who was probably like 9 at the
time), made all of the grown-assed men on the song sound like the
little white kid from Quo.  Seriously....

I'm not saying that his verse was all super ill or something, but even
back then, that fool had a way of stealing the spotlight, like he does
now, even when his verses aren't all that great.

Now, the verse on the Little Brother song wasn't all that bad to me,
and I actually liked the 'fair' line, though it took me about 4
listens to the song to really feel the verse.  Then again, I used to
think Pooh was wack too, until I really sat down and listened to
'Sleepers'.  I thought he came off on that CD.  Then I realized that
is isn't that he's wack, it is more of a case that Phonte is so many
light years ahead of him.

Lil' Wayne does have some dumb sounding verses, and his voice is
annoying, but he does also sprinkle in a line or two hear and there
that makes you do a double take.  I don't think I could ever buy a
whole CD of him, but I can take him in little doses, so guest
appearances here and there are ok in my book, but I do feel like he
has begun to spread himself a little too thin.

Right along with T-Pain (who's popularity I still can't understand)...

Dude, I've often said that &quot;you're on drugs&quot; and this cements that. Lil
Weasel is nowhere on the skill level of Rakim. NOWHERE.....you know it
and I know. So, I don't know where you're going with that one. It would
be facetious on your part to even use &quot;wack&quot; and &quot;Rakim&quot; in the same
sentence. One line, one verse, one song, it matters not. Lil Weasel,
like PackFM said, just raps. He's no MC, nowhere, no how. And many
people, sadly enough, are literally brainwashing themselves into
thinking this idiot is dope. Jigga-boo, on a bad day(and they all are to
me), would even kill this guy. Inundation is a hell of a thing, and
that's ALL you get from this clown.

I have to agree that I peeped Wayne because of the hype but I have never
been swayed to think any differently than how I originally felt about him
==&gt; below average at best.

By my calculations, he's recently contributed 3 poor guest verses on albums
by artists/groups that I wished hadn't mess with him - Little Brother
(&quot;Breakin' My Heart&quot;), Jay-Z (&quot;Hello Brooklyn 2.0&quot;) and Kanye West (&quot;Barry
Bonds&quot;).

IMO none of those verses could have enhanced his rep but people love him
based on his previous efforts, so therefore those guest spots probably only
make his rep bigger... If that is Hip-Hop, then I wish it was dead!

For the record, hip hop is alive and kicking like a motherfucker.

You are dodging the actual debate, Quest (you do this often.)  TJ did
not say Rakim was wack or Lil Wayne was anywhere near his level
lyrically (his opinion or mine don't really come into play.)  He said
&quot;You thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me&quot; is a ridiculous
line.  He didn't use the word &quot;wack&quot; in reference to it.  I will -
it's a terrible line.  It isn't even like it's some old slang we
forgot or anything... it's poor poetry.

Rakim has a great voice and delivery (the best to many... probablyh
not me)... but he's never been a thinking man's rapper.  His rhymes
are not intellectual at all... they sound good.  The '7 Emcees&quot; theory
is convoluted, and not very complicated once you actually dissect it -
but Ra SELLS it... that's what makes him great.  I'm not saying he's
ridiculously stupid like Greg Nice (who is also amazing with his
delivery,) but he's not exactly Zev Love Doom or Slick Rick.  Both of
them deliver verses with so many multiple meanings and subtle nuances
that books can be written on it.  Putting seven MCs in a line and

Let me break this down simple.  That line isn't exceedingly dumb.
Even if we were to assume hypothetically its a dumb line, that doesn't
make homeboy as wack rapper.  I pointed out 2 lines from highly
regarded rappers that are inferior to that one in order to prove the
point that &quot;dumb lines&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;wack rapper&quot;.  Also, being a dude who can
write but has a monotonous flow/voice/delivery doesn't make you a
better emcee than the dude who has a great delivery and flow that
switch up constantly and some &quot;dumb lines&quot;.  It makes you a better
writer and a worse rapper.  How exactly one breaks down the skill of
&quot;emceeing&quot; into the separate aspects of &quot;writing&quot; and &quot;rapping&quot; and
their relative importance would determine which emcee is better.

&gt; lyrically (his opinion or mine don't really come into play.)  He said
&gt; &quot;You thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me&quot; is a ridiculous
&gt; line.  He didn't use the word &quot;wack&quot; in reference to it.  I will -
&gt; it's a terrible line.  It isn't even like it's some old slang we
&gt; forgot or anything... it's poor poetry.

&gt; Rakim has a great voice and delivery (the best to many... probablyh
&gt; not me)... but he's never been a thinking man's rapper.  His rhymes
&gt; are not intellectual at all... they sound good.  The '7 Emcees&quot; theory
&gt; is convoluted, and not very complicated once you actually dissect it -
&gt; but Ra SELLS it... that's what makes him great.  I'm not saying he's
&gt; ridiculously stupid like Greg Nice (who is also amazing with his
&gt; delivery,) but he's not exactly Zev Love Doom or Slick Rick.  Both of
&gt; them deliver verses with so many multiple meanings and subtle nuances
&gt; that books can be written on it.  Putting seven MCs in a line and
&gt; putting them to shame at the same time isn't exactly scholarship.  To
&gt; me, Rakim's crowning achievement was probably &quot;Mahogany&quot; because he

I would like to cosign this and relate that I often forget how
irrelevant actual rapping is to cats on the internet.  Of course those
who choose to communicate through a text based medium are gonna put
way more emphasis on the words used than on the actual act of rapping
the lyrics....  This is why jay gets props for referencing the
boroughs sideways in the song but no one cares about all the
references wayne drops because they aren't written, they're in his
actual vocalization of the lyrics.

Seriously, I'm not a &quot;dissecting line for line-type&quot; of Hip Hop fan. But
make sense if you're going to rap. Lord, even when he was with Cash
Money, Young Turk was better than this dude. Amazing what
exposure/saturation can do for you.

&lt;&lt;IMO none of those verses could have enhanced his rep but people love
him based on his previous efforts, so therefore those guest spots
probably only make his rep bigger.&gt;&gt;

See the last sentence above. That's basically where he's getting his
love. But this is also coming from people that came up during the golden
era. I know for certain that that clown would've been laughed at at any
venue he thought about doing a show at.

&lt;&lt;For the record, hip hop is alive and kicking like a motherfucker.&gt;&gt;

If you say so NATTY. For this one, I'll be brief and concise....and to
the point. To even throw a line of Rakim's to Lil Weasel is blasphemy
unto itself. It just made me scratch my head. With that out of the way,
Rakim tells his story and MAKES SENSE all the way through song and the
line(s) flows clearly in the grand scheme of things. Now, if that one
line blemishes Rakim overall, I'm scratching my head to that one as
well. But from all this &quot;all Weasel, all the time&quot; era, dude is nowhere
close to being coherent, poetry and him is akin to oil and water. And
granted all MCs say something that may make you double-take, this clown
does it consistently and therein lies the difference. That's as on-topic
as I can get for you.

indeed dumbed down. Anyway, admittedly most if not all MCs have said a
line or two(or a plethora of lines) that made you say &quot;huh?&quot;, but to
compare a line from Rakim to Weasel is crazy. At least his line
coincides with what he's taking about on the whole and this dude is all
over the place. Not just on &quot;Breakin' My Heart&quot;, but the Jigga-boo song,
Robin Thicke's song, pretty much everywhere I've heard him. And THAT'S
what makes him wack overall. And no way on Earth could you ever question
Rakim in the grand scheme of things. As for Schooly D, he's a pioneer.
Not a lyrical giant by any stretch, but to throw the former in there is
off by a mile in my view. That's all I'm saying.

it's not adlibs... those are put in after the verse is recorded.
Wayne uses sounds and tones WITHIN his verse... and it works for me.
As for the squeaky voice, I like it better slowed down (which is how I
hear it 98% of the time.)  Jay Z slowed sounds just as bad.

And it's not a Rakim comparison... but give me one Rakim line that

if he feels dude is wack then fine - but picking a line (and in this

Quest would be calling it wack as fuck.

Bear in mind that I don't think Rakim is wack, but as you say, I could
pick out a ton of lines that make him sound wack, that read wack on
here, and generally use him to support an argument that Ra is wack.

(Especially if I selected only songs from certain later albums.)

The whole shit is just counterproductive. Why post about how wack he
is, unless you want to spark debate? And then when that debate comes
you're not willing to give any ground, but are intent on making others
give ground to see only your point of view?

A to the L wrongly asserts:
&lt;&lt;no the difference is that quest is taking apart a Lil Wayne line and
using it to reinforce his opinion that Wayne is wack.&gt;&gt;

True. However, it's a line from an entire verse. His verse was wack, no
sense in reciting the entire verse. That part stuck out the most because
of its' stupidity. And having listened to him where he has all the
verses alone, it's still the same. My opinion is based on all I've heard
from him, thus, my judgment that he's wack. Let's kill that right there.

&lt;&lt;if he feels dude is wack then fine - but picking a line (and in this
case a line that actually ISN'T dumb, isn't ignorant, and IS actually

Yes sir and I do. But see above. Maybe we're seeing wack and dope
through different fogged glasses, because &quot;playing fair like
rollercoasters and clowns&quot; will have most folks looking at you stupid.
So that &quot;clever&quot; statement, to me, is a stretch. Again, &quot;playing fair
like rollercoasters and clowns&quot;...repeat.... And your last example is as
pipe-dream because he's not that good to make a dope verse, to say
nothing of a song. If he did, I'd be the first to say, &quot;damn, he did
that?&quot; But I have no worries there.

&lt;&lt;Bear in mind that I don't think Rakim is wack, but as you say, I could

Well, you can't call Rakim wack. I mean you can, but you'd be playing
yourself. Taking you out of the equation, across the Hip Hop spectrum,
dude is an icon. Weasel is a side show. The &quot;7 emcees&quot; line is one of
the greatest in rap history, bar none. And songs like &quot;Keep The Beat&quot; or
&quot;In The Ghetto&quot;(read those on here) for example shoot down &quot;wack&quot; and
&quot;Rakim&quot; in the same sentence. Talk about an asinine claim.

&lt;&lt;The whole shit is just counterproductive. Why post about how wack he
is, unless you want to spark debate? And then when that debate comes
you're not willing to give any ground, but are intent on making others
give ground to see only your point of view?&gt;&gt;

Wrong answer. We're giving our views, it's not the end all, be all. And
that's what you sound like here. In a debate, I would speak my
position/belief and you do yours. No one gives ground(or any position
better than the next) except that the two parties have equal time to
have their positions heard. Further, there is really no debate here, the
header is all you need to know...I'm scratching my head over the
affinity(or brainwashing) Hip Hop has with this clown.

&lt;&lt;I still don't understand whats so &quot;dumb&quot; about the line? The way he
flips the word &quot;fair&quot; from &quot;equal/legitimate&quot; to &quot;carnival&quot;? Its a
humorous analogy flipping the meaning of the word fair, while giving a
moral lesson about hard work and not cutting corners. Seriously. Dudes
even got a fucking positive message in there.&gt;&gt;

Since when did rollercoasters &quot;play fair&quot; with regards to a cheater? How
about clowns that &quot;play fair&quot; with regards to a cheater? You still have
to ask? Lastly, how do both of these things compare to him &quot;playing
fair&quot;? The &quot;analogy&quot; is stupid. Not just this song, most of all I've
ever heard from this boy is stupid. Which is why I believe he's wack.

Ummmm... Quest gets moron of the year award.  Rollercoasters and
clowns appear at fairs.  He's playing on the double meaning of the
word.  That's not stupid... it's just a form of metaphor.  Did you not
know that the word fair has more than one meaning??
