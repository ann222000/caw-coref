This may sound extremely ignorant (and I suppose is) but can I
download things like movie clips from uTube or not? A friend has
asked me to download and put on a 2 gig memory stick a couple of
clips from utube - and I don't know how to do it (I've got boradband,
he is on dial up and it takes too too long for him).

Sorry for such a silly query!

I've not used it myself but I'm reliably informed that this Firefox &quot;add
on&quot; works well.

You'll need Firefox web browser, of course.

This works for me. Just find the video,
highlight the address in the address line,
switch to this site, paste it into the box
and click the Get Video button.

To play it, you'll need something like the
free VLC player ( www.videolan.org ).

Well, I've tried all of the suggestions - downloaded the recommended
add-ons, but it won't work. I get messages telling me that the URL is
not correct (it is!). I think I shall just tell my friend to get
broadband and then I can send the URL's.....

Incidentally, this is what I am trying to download...

There is a way to download the video from YouTube using only Safari. Are you
using Safari?

Have you tried TubeSock .?

Just paste the link into the app and the movie file is downloaded in
choice of formats for viewing. Tried it a couple of times with small
vids and seems to work

Ok, it's pretty simple.

1. Open the YouTube page you want the file from.
2. Open the Activity window. (Window&gt;Activity)
3. Find the video file in the Activity window (usually the largest
part, in this case it's the uppermost part - 17.1Mb)
4. Click to highlight it and copy using Apple+C
5. Open a new browser window and paste into it.
6. Press Return and the download should start.
7. You should be left with a file call 'Get_Video'. Rename it to
something meaningful and give it the suffix .flv
8. Play it using the flash video player of your choice. VLC works but
keeps crashing when I try to search forwards or backwards.
9.Ta-da!

Gimme a shout if you get stuck. I tried it with the file you want,
and it works ok.

Darren,

I followed the instructions below - I think accurately - but when I
paste into a new browser window and press return  the you tube video
just starts playing again - no sign of a download beginning?

Am I supposed to have the  you tube video playing when I open the
activity window?

I think I am technologically challenged....

&gt; Ok, it's pretty simple.

&gt; 1. Open the YouTube page you want the file from.
&gt; 2. Open the Activity window. (Window&gt;Activity)
&gt; 3. Find the video file in the Activity window (usually the largest
&gt; part, in this case it's the uppermost part - 17.1Mb)
&gt; 4. Click to highlight it and copy using Apple+C
&gt; 5. Open a new browser window and paste into it.
&gt; 6. Press Return and the download should start.
&gt; 7. You should be left with a file call 'Get_Video'. Rename it to
&gt; something meaningful and give it the suffix .flv
&gt; 8. Play it using the flash video player of your choice. VLC works
&gt; but keeps crashing when I try to search forwards or backwards.
&gt; 9.Ta-da!

&gt; Gimme a shout if you get stuck. I tried it with the file you want,
&gt; and it works ok.

Use TubeSock, just copy the entire URL in your Safari window, for example
³ http://www.youtube.com/x² then let TubeSock do the rest.

Don't you have to buy it to download files longer than 30 seconds?

Just to return to the matter of a MBP and airline use:

My 17&quot; 2.4 core 2 due 2 Gb has failed to work with the power supplied
in 4 different seats on 2 separate flights in BA 747 400s (new style
business class) and in 2 Qantas 747 300s. I have tried with the
battery removed, and, in the BA seats, have tried various plugs.

I repeat what I was told by Qantas: that the new macs draw too much
power, specially the 17 ins. I am not sure I find this an entirely
credible explanation, but anyhow I was certainly powerless, and no
amount of resetting the circuit breakers, or other imaginative
solutions made any difference.

Maybe others who did not have such problems were using slightly less
power-hungry machines, but my recent trip has been irritatingly
restricted by my inability to work because of a lack of power, and I
think it worth warning SMIG because others may be travelling in the
expectation that they will have power, and find they do not have.

(The power supply was fine, once I got home).

Thanks for the information, I have rechecked with my colleagues at BA
and Boeing and they have no official reports of any problems so I
have passed on your information to them along with the following link
that I found ( http://www.user-groups.net/apple/0607-17_macbook2.html ) .
It seems that this does not affect all models but just some odd ones.
i.e. if your machine draws current at the the high end of it's
tolerance and there are a large number of users on the system then
this may cause problems. I would be keen to hear from anyone, who
knows of similar events to contact me as the more cases we have the
easier it is to find a solution apart from the obvious one of banning
the charging of Apple computers on flights.
I was involved in testing our fleet of Boeing 767's after we had
totally replaced the in-flight entertainment system and I used my 17&quot;
powerbook as one of the test computers (we needed to use a lot of
computers on that day!) and we had no problems. But each situation is
different so I could do with as much information as possible.You can
contact me off list if you prefer.

Hello All,
A little while back I downloaded a firmware update for the superdrive
on my black macbook.  ever since, at startup, the superdrive update
loads but always says it can't find the device.  Is this a warning I
should heed?  Since today, the macbook EFI Firmware update has been
available to me on software update but when I try to install it I am
told there isn't enough space on my startup disk...odd since there's
40gb on my hard disk... any ideas boffins?

Hi Johnathan

This is a common problem. As the update has run and updated the superdrive,
there technically is no superdrive capable of being updated (because it has
already been updated!). Go to Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Accounts &gt;
Your account &gt; login items &gt; delete ³Superdrive Update².

Not sure why the EFI Firmware update won¹t run, have you tried repairing
permissions in Disk Utility? You can get that sort of error when the program
can¹t write to a certain folder if the assumed explanation for the error is
that there¹s no space.

Hello All,
A little while back I downloaded a firmware update for the superdrive
on my black macbook.  ever since, at startup, the superdrive update
loads but always says it can't find the device.  Is this a warning I
should heed?  Since today, the macbook EFI Firmware update has been
available to me on software update but when I try to install it I am
told there isn't enough space on my startup disk...odd since there's
40gb on my hard disk... any ideas boffins?

I have a 17 ins G5 iMac. It has a whining squeal that used to be
occasional but has recently become permanent: it goes on any time the
machine is active.

I believe this is the fan. Has anyone any suggestion as to what I
should do: it is a job for Mac hospital?

Andrew,

I don't know if you managed to get any of the other methods to work, but
I've been using http://vixy.net/ with some success. Go to the page of the
video you require, copy the URL from the address bar and paste it into the
box on the site, then choose your desired format and you're off.

Well, I've tried all of the suggestions - downloaded the recommended

Ranulph,

This is a 'feature' of the G5 iMac family in my experience, which was
addressed in later revisions. Apparently the noise is 'within
specifications' (nice caveat).

As for a solution, it would require a hardware hack. You can read up more
here:

yes but if it's got worse recently then worth a vacuum. My iMac
G5 is virtually silent, all the time, and runs all day and often
all ngiht bittorrenting.

&gt; Hi Johnathan

&gt; This is a common problem. As the update has run and updated the
&gt; superdrive, there technically is no superdrive capable of being updated
&gt; (because it has already been updated!). Go to Apple Menu &gt; System
&gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts &gt; Your account &gt; login items &gt; delete &quot;Superdrive
&gt; Update&quot;.

I have vacuumed, and the pitch may have become slightly less than a
whistle, but that's it. So it looks like I need to persuade Apple
this is a fault.

A friend has asked me to copy a DVD containing a slideshow of photos

Never done this before, can I do this from standard mac os x software
or do I need a program to facilitate this?

Disk Utility should manage it. Select the disk and go to
New...Disk Image from (unnecessarily obscure name).

When you get the Save as...dialog, choose CD/DVD master from the
drop-down list that will show 'compressed' by default, name the
disk image.

When the disk image is created, then you select THAT in the list
in Disk Utility (it will end in .dmg, THAT list), insert blank
disk, go to Images menu, choose Burn.

Well, no, I'm not absolutely sure at all!

It's not a commercial disc and has an image of the dear old ladies
face on it and no other information.

When it shows up on desk top it says DVD on the little disc image,
but I guess it could be a CD?

Good morning to all

I would like to watch and record Sky TV on my Mac but am not sure
what equipment to use - is  anyone out there doing this? I have
previously had Eye TV stuff but as far as I can see this will only
work with free to view Terrestrial TV. I have also just moved to an
area that does not receive Freeview so my non-paying options are
limited. Has anyone any experience of this?

Chris Staples

&gt;thanks jason, burned it onto a CD as per your instructions....it

&gt;thanks very much for your responses

you're welcome. I guess Disk Utility decided that a CD would be
enough for what you needed:-)

might not play in DVD players, of course, unless they do picture disks.
