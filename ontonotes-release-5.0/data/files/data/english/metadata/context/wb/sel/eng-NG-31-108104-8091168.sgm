I've been worrying about how Clara will behave with the cats when I
get her home tomorrow. The kennel staff had never tried Clara with
cats, but felt from her personality that she would be OK. I was still
unsure....

So today I arranged to take HRFL Tiger up to the Dogs Trust in
Bridgend so that I could see for myself how she behaved around cats.
The Dogs Trust behaviourist, Rachel supervised everything and took us
into a quiet office with Clara on a long lead. HRFL stayed in his cat
basket. Clara ignored him, and refused to look at him! So Rachel took
HRFL out of his basket and put him on her lap. Clara sniffed, then
ignored him.

HRFL then decided he was going to explore the room. Although Clara
gave him the &quot;collie stare&quot; she made no move to go towards him, and
indeed, she and HRFL sniffed noses and the Clara moved away from
HRFL.

I am so very proud of my boy. HRFL had a 30 minute car journey,
followed by sitting in the Dogs Trust reception watching lots of dogs
&amp; people come and go for 20 minutes before he went into a strange room
smelling of dog and met a fully grown unfamiliar border collie who he
had the courage to sniff noses with. He took it all in his stride, and
is now home, wandering around the house and yelling for attention.

I think if I introuce her carefully, Clara will be fine. :)

Sounds wonderful.  I kind of figure any Border Collie who hasn't been
damaged into bad behavior in some way should be OK around cats.

Kayla of course grew up with them.  Her real test is with the Chihuahua who
is determined to test her to the limit.  (I really do wish Camille would
quit putting her head in Kayla's mouth when she yawns.)

They aren't only bred to herd, but to be babysitters.  They even herd ducks
and geese (training with those can start at six or seven weeks of age) so of
course they must not harm baby ducks or geese.   If they are OK with a
newborn lamb. they should be OK with a cat.

I'm kind of surprised that they do it this way. Wouldn't it have been
easier to let you take Clara home for this test? (Not permanently, just
to see how she gets along with your cats.) It would definitely give a
better idea of how the cats would respond, in their own territory, not
distracted and/or stressed by a bunch of other stuff like a strange place
and a long car ride.

On one hand, maybe this is a better test because if he can respond well
under pressure, then he'll probably be fine at home. On the other, he
has no territory to defend at the Dogs Trust. A cat (not necessarily HRFL,
but some cats) might be a lot more aggressive when a strange dog comes
into *their* territory.

In any case, I'm glad it went well!

Sounds like things are going OK, but keep in mind that this was a *neutral*
area, that smelled of *d*g*.

What happens when the d*g invades HRFL's territory????  Will HRFL &amp; the
other cats go on the defensive?  Protect their digs? Or run &amp; hide from the
big, hair, smelly, drooly invader?

Just my .02 - and now I have no sense left at all.  Time to take a nap!

I totally get where you're coming from. :0)

However, the aim of today was not to start introductions, but *PURELY*
to guage Clara's reactions to cats to check she was not &quot;cat
agressive&quot;. The Dogs Trust had never tried her out with a cat and
although they thought she would be OK they had never seen her behave
in a cats company. HRFL Tiger is very mellow about dogs having had one
for the last few years, and also he does not get particularly stressed
in new environments (Including the vets!!) so I figured that he was
the best one to take up to &quot;cat test&quot; Clara and indeed, he appeared to
actually enjoy the outing because he was so relaxed and was rolling
around on his back in his carrier purring and letting Rachel the
behaviourist stroke him in front of the dog!. (Go figure!).

Now I have seen for my own eyes that Claras first instinct is not to
chase and eat pussy cats, but to look away and stay calm and relaxed
and more interested in cuddles from humans, it means that I have a
chance of integrating her into the home after a series of *VERY*
careful introductions. :)   Clara will initally be confined to the
kitchen with the use of a child gate. The cats will be able to come
and go through the childgate bars at their own whim, whilst clara will
not be able to chase them. It took 6 weeks using the same procedure to
introduce my brothers dog Shadow, who is a 70lb black lab, but
eventually everyone rubbed along happliy. I'm hoping that this will go
the same way. :)

I'm gearing Jake and Molly up for some very special purrs.  You do know
there is absolutely nothing to stop Clara going over the baby gate.  Other
than not knowing she can.

I'm rather constantly amused that Kayla respects the gate, even though I
know perfectly well she can jump much higher.  Not to mention she could
climb if she were so inclined.

So purrs for Clara to chose to respect the gate.
