Folks

Please, I would really like everyone's input on this item.  We had a
discussion at our last meeting about making some winch modifications.

First and easiest, Ken Davidson mentioned modifying the brake system
on the winches.  his suggestion is to shorten and change the shape of
the brake arm.  This would make the winch easier to manage during
transport.  He plans on producing a aluminum prototype when he can
find the time.

Second, and where I'd like the discussion and or input from our club
members, is about adding wheels or somehow making the winches easier
to transport.  Dave G. can certainly add more to this thought.  I see
some positives and negatives to making / adding to the existing winch
size.  I for one am limited on trunk space and adding wheels or
placing the winch in a wheeled box might limit me to what I could
bring to the field. (This pretty much applies to all non-truck
winchmasters.)  One solution was to ask the parks about having access
to the shelter building to store the winches.  I like the idea of
this, but I certainly don't trust the security of the building.

Again, I'm hoping Dave can elaborate on this thought and then I would
encourage everyone to submit there ideas.  BTW, our treasury is doing
well at the moment.

Dave, here are my thoughts on your list:

1) A shorter brake sounds like a good idea. Mine has a cotter key that lets
me quickly disconnect the brake and store it inside the area of the winch.
i.e. so it can't get bent. But a shorter brake sounds better.

2 A) Winch masters are permitted to drive onto the field to place and pick
up the winches so wheels are not the problem. The problem with winches is
having to lift them from the ground and into the vehicle and out of the
vehicle and down to the ground. Anything you add to the winch to make it
heavier to lift or more awkward to handle is bad bad bad.

2 B) To me there is merit it any idea that stores one winch at the field for
anyone to use that we give a key to like paid up members any of you PAID UP
out there?  Anyway I digress, it would be worth risking one winch to store
it at the field in a lock box or shed or what ever with a little red wagon
to pull it with and it would have to have  good NAPA float
charger plugged in to keep it charged. That would be nice but hard to pull
off.

One more thought about winches: If we could cut some of the wood off so that
the battery would sit separate on the ground during operation the remaining
winch would need four stakes to be secure it in place or some other
mechanism to anchor it.during operation. This would reduce the weight and
size of the winch so it would fit better into small spaces and not kill your
back lifting. The on and off switch and other parts would line up along the
back of the winch.

I was starting to come to that same conclusion.  I'll contact Tim and
see what kind of price we could get on his winch kit minus the drum.
Could someone with more brain power than I take a look at the page and
see or verify that what we have (motor, balls, drum, solenoids kill
switch etc... fit on this frame.  We might think of switching to the
foot switch plug shown below the first image.

I was at Lowes yesterday and found a few wheeled boxes that the winch could fit in. The only problem I saw was a box big enough to fit the winch in its current configuration is fairly large and could be a problem for somebody with limited space. I did find a nice wheeled two compartment box that the battery and all of the winch supplies would fit in. It is no larger than the boxes we are using now but has wheels.

Just for a FYI I did contact Tim and the Winch Frames with drum (he
doesn't split the kits) runs 345 a piece.  That surely runs outside
our budget....

Long time reader first time writer. Would the strap on luggage wheels (they fold down small look like a two wheeler) work for moving the winches? I picked one up at a garage sell for a couple bucks and use it strapped to a milk create for gallons of fuel. I have seen them in airports for 20.00. Harbor Freight has a big selection of wheels if your making your own carrier.
