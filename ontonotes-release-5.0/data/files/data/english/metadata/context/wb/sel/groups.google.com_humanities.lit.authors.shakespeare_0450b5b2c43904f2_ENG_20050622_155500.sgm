1850 Melville: &quot;In Shakespeare's tomb lies infinitely more than
Shakepeare EVER wrote. And if I magnify Shakepeare it is not so much
for what he did do but for what he did not do, or refrained from doing.
For in this world of lies, TRUTH is forced to FLY like a scared
white doe in the woodlands; and only by cunning glimspes
will she reveal herself, as in Shakespeare..&quot;
------------------------------­-----------------------------
The Rape of Lucrece Stanza 165

&quot;As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,
Wildly determining which way to FLY,
Or one encompass'd with a winding MAZE,
That cannot tread the way out readily;&quot;
So with herself is she in mutiny,
To live or die which of the TWAIN were better,
When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
------------------------------­------------------------------­----
Mark TWAIN: &lt;&lt;The bust, too--there in the Stratford Church.
The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust, the serene
bust, the emotionless bust, with the DANDY MUSTACHE,
and the putty face, unseamed of care--that face which has looked
passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years
and will still look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with
the deep, deep, deep, subtle, subtle, subtle expression of a BLADDER.&gt;&gt;

FALSE STAFF: a plague of sighing and grief!
it blows a man up like a BLADDER.
There's villanous news abroad: here was
Sir John Bracy from your father;

That same mad fellow of the north, PERCY,
and he of Wales, that gave Amamon
the bastinado and MADE LUCIFER cuckold

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this MAZE,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

JOHN MILTON's _Hymn on the Morning of Christ's Nativity_

So when the Sun in bed,
Curtain'd with cloudy red,
Pillows his chin upon an Orient wave,
The flocking shadows pale,
Troop to th'infernall jail,
Each fetter'd Ghost slips to his severall grave,
And the yellow-skirted Fayes,
Fly after the Night-steeds, leaving their Moon-lov'd MAZE.

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd

Address'd his way, not with indented wave,
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd
Fould above fould a surging MAZE, his Head
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd
Hermione and Cadmus, or the God
In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd
Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,
Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore
[S]cipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique

[T]o interrupt, side-long he works his way.
[A]s when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
[N]igh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
{VERES oft}, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;

So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd
To such disport before her through the Field,
From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd.

_The SPANISH MAZE_ by Richard Malim

In Peter Thomson' _Shakespeare's Professional Career_
there is a list of the 11 production sof plays
given at the Court Christmas Revels 1604/5:

Othello, The Merry Wives of WIndsor, Measure for Measure, The Comedy
of Errors, Henry V, Every Man Out of His Humour, Love's Labour's Lost,
Every Man in His Humour, The Merchant of Venice, THE SPANISH MAZE.

In The Tempest_, a &quot;MAZE&quot; is a very good desciption of what
they find on the he island, both geographically and psychologically.

The Tempest Act 3, Scene 3

GONZALO: By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
My old bones ache: here's a MAZE TROD indeed
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.

Act 5, Scene 1

ALONSO: This is as strange a MAZE as e'er men TROD
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.
------------------------------­------------------------------
Moby Dick -- or The Whale by Herman Melville

CHAPTER 44 THE cHArT.

But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before
him, Ahab was threading a MAZE of currents and eddies, with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.

CHAPTER 130 THE HAT.

Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
in a MAZE of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying
again round his head.

The American Frontier and the Initiation Rite to a National Literature.
The Example of Edgar Huntly by Charles Brockden Brown

&lt;&lt;Edgar wishes to transcend boundaries and probe human thought,
consciousness and passions. This is an extremely difficult task as the
human frame is intricate, labyrinthine, and full of asperity like the
paths Edgar follows through the wilderness; the recurrent use of the
word MAZE is suggestive of the protagonist's real &amp; metaphorical
journey (Bulgheroni 170- 71).&gt;&gt; - Michele Bottalico
