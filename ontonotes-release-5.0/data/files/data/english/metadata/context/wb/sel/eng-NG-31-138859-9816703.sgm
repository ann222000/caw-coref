*MISCARRIAGE*

*Miscarriage* or abortion may be defined as the termination of pregnancy
before the period of viability, which is considered to occur at 28 th week.
Miscarriages generally take place in the first two trimesters. Â The chance
of a miscarriage in the third trimester is extremely low.

&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;Various
causes for the *miscarriage* may be infection such as viral infection,
chronic illness such as chronic nephritis, acute or chronic respiratory
disease, and severe anemia. Direct trauma on the abdominal wall by blow or
fall may be related to abortion. Emotional upset or change in environment
may lead to abortion by affecting the uterine activity. A mom in a high
stress situation (perhaps unmarried, financial problems, health problems,
unstable marriage, unwanted pregnancy, etc.) is more likely to miscarry. In
some women even a minor trauma, internal examination in the early months of
pregnancy or sexual intercourse in early months can also lead to abortion.

&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;Environmental
toxins like lead, arsenic, anesthetic gases, tobacco, caffeine, alcohol,
radiation in excess amount increase the risk of abortion. Drugs used for
epilepsy or antimalarial preparations are not harmful when used in small
doses but in high doses they can induce abortion.

&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;Cervical
incompetence, either congenital or acquired is one of the commonest causes
of midtrimester and recurrent abortions. Congenital malformation of the
uterus may be responsible for midtrimester or recurrent abortion. Premature
rupture of the membranes inevitably leads to abortion. Hormonal imbalance
due to deficiency of progesterone making the uterine environment less
receptive is also responsible for abortion.

&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;Other
causes of *miscarriage* may include the following: Chromosomal abnormalities
of the fetus, incompetent os i.e. weakness of the cervical muscles,
excessive water i.e. hydramnios, low-lying placenta causing bleeding and
consequently abortion, and lifting heavy weights

&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;Sometimes
dietary factors such as deficiency of folic acid or vitamin E are often
thinks to be responsible for the abortion. When a pregnant woman is under
stress, she not only depletes her own vitamin and mineral reserves and her
own adrenal and glandular strength, but she drains these things off her
baby.
&lt; http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/bestofyahoo/vote/showgroups.php?cat... &gt;The
patient with threatened abortion shows the increased vaginal bleeding,
aggravation of pain in the lower abdomen.
