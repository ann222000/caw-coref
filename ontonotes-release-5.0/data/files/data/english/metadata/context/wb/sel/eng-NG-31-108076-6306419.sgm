Three of my young daughter's friends were assaulted by five girls* while getting
off a train today...and have spent a few hours today at the police station giving
statements. It seems the assailants started the 'what are you looking at?' line
in the train and followed the girls out onto the street after, where they punched
them to the ground. A few passersby stepped in and halted the melee until the
cops could arrive. Lots of bruises and split lips, no major damage, cctv recorded
the whole thing.

Their whole 'we're not interested in learning self defence' stance has suddenly
changed, as has my daughter's. We'll be buying them pepper sprays on Monday, too.

They're all over for a sleepover now, so I have to get on with making lasagne
etc.

Cool. They got punched to the ground, ehh? So what style do you gather
they'd be interested in picking up? If it's just punches or stard up
shit, may I suggest shotokan or wing chun? Actually, goju-ryu is the
#1 karate style among women as I've heard. They should look into it.

I'm sure they were all scared and weirded out by the whole incident.
And good for the passersby who stepped in, and showed the girls they
weren't alone. That would have really been awful to have no one come to
their aide.

One of the things that is reality, is that some people aren't cut out to
get into self defense training beyond a few rudiments- but everyone- can
be taught to be really pissed off at the assault and not just sit back
and have to take it.  I hope they can do a bit of both. Hope you have
some luck gently coaxing them to get a grip on these issues. It will be
tough for some or all of them, so go easy on them.

Thanks, Mark. They're nodding off now after a good dinner and watching a
chick-flick, which is what they wanted to do. The parents were happy to have them
get together for a sleepover so they could talk it all out. Poor little
gals....they feel safe here and safe together so I'm happy to be their hosts. My
daughter could quite easily have been on the same train...she decided earlier in
the day not to go with her friends, but it was only a last minute decision on her
part.

This might well make the news/media...I'll post a link if it does.

Not really. I think this GDS joker is so stupid in thinking that gay
wrestling sport called BJJ can work on the street, he is going to send
his daughter to learn it. I can imagine now, the next time his
daughter is swarmed, she will meticulously fall to the ground with all
four in the air like a flipped turtle, and threaten her assailants by
saying: "If you come anywhere near me, I'll hump your leg until your
face turns blue".

Although BJJ is useless on the street, she will be able to use it in
bed with her boyfriend. In the same flipped turtle "sweet surrender"
position, she will be saying: "Please come over and let me suck you
into my body from both ends".

You mean I didn't show up by discussing inflation on the us dollar
with quotes from the founding fathers or in the discussion involving
graduated traning methods as a way to explain traditional hip punching
in Karate? You're merely responding to an obvious set up on one of
GDS's boring trolls.

And, as someone who, correct me if I am wrong, blamed his sciatica on
chen style taijiquan, I find it fascinating that you would be so
willing to enter into another flamewar with someone who has only ever
stived to come up with an english theory of chen style taijiquan
himself. Before you get your knickers in a knot this time around, take
a step back and evaluate what the hell is going on for once. You said
it yourself, "Tai chi was a fighting art with a specific use of body
mechanics that I think can be most useful as a mecheanism for health,
if the specific skills of the art are taught and learned. " (Mark
Goldberg, July 27th, 2000). If you want to talk how I was humiliated
off the newsgroup, perhaps you simply don't understand the reason why
I left, nor the reason why I am here today. Perhaps you would care to
re-read the discussion I had with mike evans where he goes on and on
about down power in an attempt, not to discuss theory with me, but in
an attempt to humiliate me by somehow catching me in a lie or logical
fallacy. I think you were there too. Everything I said was made fun of
regardless of the source, and what wasn't made fun of I was accused of
parroting. Well, I assume we're both chen style practitioners. So why
all the hostility Mark? Are you financially threatened by my presence
on r.m-a? Don't be. I'm not *really* charging any money for my
knowledge. I swear!

Unfortunately, that is the case. Most of us wander around with the that will
never happen to me syndrome. I have a young niece that is that way and it
makes me and her father nuts.  Then after it happens and after ignoring the
advice of out elders ( in this case you),  we take steps to prevent being a
victim. Lessons of life learned the hard way. People in our ccw classes have
usually been the victims of some serious altercations.
But perhaps the young ladies  will profit from this unpleasant experience.
Perhaps they will understand it could have been a lot worse; and that there
is nothing wrong with being able to take care of yourself. If so they may
have learned a valuable lesson lightly but damn unpleasantly. I hope they
will stick to their resolve to learn some self defense.
Pepper spray is a good idea. Any further steps?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cool. They got punched to the ground, ehh? So what style do you gather
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they'd be interested in picking up? If it's just punches or stard up
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shit, may I suggest shotokan or wing chun? Actually, goju-ryu is the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; #1 karate style among women as I've heard. They should look into it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's hard to think of a more retarded response than this.

&gt; &gt; How about saying 'yet another reason why karate sucks' in response to
&gt; &gt; a comment that graduated training methods are commonly found in asian
&gt; &gt; martial arts?

&gt; &gt; Bingo!

&gt; Not even close. Thinking that 14 year old girls getting assaulted is 'cool' is
&gt; about as retarded as it gets.
">

Naw, that's you being close-minded again. Cool was in reference to the
fact that they are interested in training and they're getting pepper
spray. The next sentence,  which was a question, was clearly a
separate idea, hence the "Ehh". Thats why people say ehh, BTW, to
remove ambiguity in such misreadings of the english language. Yes,
there is actually a reason why people say ehh.

Maybe if I rephrased it as follows it would make more sense to an
american:

"Cool, theyre' interested in training and getting pepper spray,
although I had no idea why I just repeated what you said since the
implied pronoun "that's" references the very last subject of
discussion which was pepper spray and a willingness to train martial
arts.

So. They got punched to the ground? What style do you think they will
want or need to learn? May I suggest karate or wing chun due to the
fact they were punched to the ground, a logical conclusion by any
means".

Get the one that looks like a yawara stick- then teach them
nerve-attack/vulnerability points. What you have to condition your hands to
do, a yawara does easily. There used to be one that was a good stick, good
pepper spray, and dyed them green as well.
If you want to, you can bypass the spray part and just teach them the
short-stick. There are a bunch of good asian styles &lt;g&gt;

They've just learned that, like most things, violence ain't like it is
on the movies - it's ugly and humiliating and can have bad effects that

Show them how to deploy and use one - no threats, just *bang*, in the

time to reach it - the useful kind that you can't use in sparring.

Mark Goldberg, what the fuck are you talking about? I expressed
approval of the way he was handling the situation and the general
outcome and then asked a simple question, "what martial arts are they

on wing chun or karate. I dont get what your problem with this is, or

Same to you Mark. I didn't see you Your false concern for

COULD have been a lot worse. What, are you lying awake at night
worrying about his daughter? Get of your high horse.

In another message you so eloquently pen "I haven't done any in years.
I am an admirer of the real skills of the few real one's I've met and
read about." What happened mark, couldn't make it in Chen style so you
have to attack other practitioners of the art? Whats your problem?

I didn't notice any "concern" real or false from you on this issue,
and as yet you haven't accused anyone else of false concern. I can
only assume you're in this thread to start a flame war with me. You're
extremely unimportant to me right now, you know. You are a hostile
former practitioner of chen style. You're not interested in discussing
any of it with me, and you've clearly shown no desire to change your

I remember in the early days, you would ask honest questions about the
art, and were more often pleasant than not. What happened Mark? What
changed you?

I'll bite. You said something about being an internalist. I think i'll
just parrot what the great Mike Sigman once said, as an appeal to an
authority who traveled around and demonstrated what he knew, including
to YOU. I am not going to do that, much to your amusement I am sure.

"the fact that there is only one way to do the core
skills of Taiji." and
"Technically, in the qi paradigm, it's true that Taiji is good for
health.
However, it it still requisite that you know how to form and move
jing.
Since the qi and jing are a direct practice of 'moving the qi with the
mind'
and all health derives from the unhindered movement of the qi, then
that is
what they are referring to as the health aspect of Taiji.     Someone
who
thinks that 'health' from Taiji is related to moving through a set
magical
choreography has totally missed the point of what they mean by
'health'.

Most of the qigongs you see done in the parks are based on that exact
same
idea.   Taiji is considered a moving qigong. " - Mike Sigman, Oct. 22,
1999.

The obvious conclusion is, of course, that if those words were mine I
would be accused of fantasizing, talking out of my ass, or whatever
else the insult of the day was. Yeah well good luck with that one
Mark.

GreendistantNOSPAMstar&gt; until the cops could arrive. Lots of

GreendistantNOSPAMstar&gt; cctv recorded the whole thing.

GreendistantNOSPAMstar&gt; Their whole 'we're not interested in

GreendistantNOSPAMstar&gt; changed, as has my daughter's. We'll be
GreendistantNOSPAMstar&gt; buying them pepper sprays on Monday, too.

First off, condolences to the victims, second, applause and
congratulations that a relatively minor incident (consequence-wise)
was enough to get these young ladies to change their attitude and
fantsiy-view of life a fair bit. And happily that your daughter was
not one of the victims. Hope you can guide them well in their new
endeavour.

Agreed. The most important effect is probably the change in their view
of the world. "Fact A" + "fact B" leads to "consequences hitherto
unimagined". Doing constructive things to deal with these hitherto
unimagined consequences is a life-long thing, good to get them started
early.

Have you thought about what brand? I've read posts that claim that Fox
is the best, but I don't think that they sell a product that *I* would
want to carry, much less a young girl.

http://www.defensedevices.com/specpepspray1.html

I carry the ASP keyring. Not rated as highly as Fox, but more
carryable. There is a slightly smaller version, the palm defender.

Let me know if you go with the ASP. I'll send you a few test inserts
(shoot water), for free so they can practice and see what the stream
looks like.
