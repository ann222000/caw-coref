Part 1
Please see part 0 (template) for warnings and summary.

Jayne felt a light touch on his shoulder. Even in sleep, he was wary, and
immediately woke, growling like a guard dog at his post. The wrist now being
crushed in his hand was much smaller than he expected, the arm attached to it
slender and feminine. &quot;Gorram it, Crazy, what are you doin' here?&quot; River
smiled that strange, enigmatic smile as she extracted her wrist from his grip.
She didn't say anything, just stared down at him from her perch on his bunk,
her big brown eyes boring holes into his head. She didn't blink. Suddenly
feeling trapped, he sat up. Now he was the one looking down on her, but she
didn't even seem to notice. Her eyes followed his face, then started burning
hot trails down the rest of his body. She lingered on his chest, her fingers
reaching closer, hovering over skin and hair, but not touching. They finally
alighted on his navel, her eyes suddenly jerking up to his face. Jayne made a
strangled sound as she traced a circle around his belly button, annoyed by the
tiny smirk on her face. &quot;Gorram it, girl!&quot; he muttered, though the words came
out a little strangled. Finally, River spoke. &quot;Silly little boy, silly boy
with a girl's name.&quot; The words were almost sing-song, rhythmically in time to
the patterns she was tracing on his stomach. &quot;But he's not a boy, not a girl.&quot;
She leaned up, showing off her feline grace, the last words whispered softly
into his ear. &quot;He says he is a man, but won't show it.&quot; She blew a cool
breath across his ear. &quot;Not to me.&quot; Jayne swallowed hard. This wasn't
supposed to be happening. The girl was a nutcase, and gorram he didn't even
like her. Now she was in his bunk, dressed in what could hardly even be called
a nightgown. The sheer white fabric stopped mid thigh, and clung to her in all
the right--no, _wrong_--places. She didn't like him either, had even
threatened to kill him, actually _had_ tried to kill him, and now she was in
his bed, making him think very, very bad thoughts. It took all the control he
had not to flip her on her back and take her savagely, pushing that tiny sleep
shirt out of the way, fondling her... Gorram it, the bitch could read his
mind! He could see it on her face; she knew. She knew what he was thinking,
what he wanted to do to her. She flashed him that knowing smile and her
fingers, still playing with his navel, drifted lower. When her slender fingers
reached their destination, he gasped. Her hand was tiny, and so cold. Even
the chill wasn't enough to lessen his erection; if anything, the feel of her
made it harder, more insistent. &quot;River...?&quot; The word tore out of his throat,
half moan, half plea.

Her answer was to reach up with her other hand to gently touch his lips,
running her fingers across them, tracing the curve of his lower lip. He caught
her wrist again, but she didn't pull back. She bit her lip and grinned.

A half second later, River was on her back, Jayne straddling her. He leaned
into her, holding her wrists tightly above her head, his face just a few inches
from hers, breathing heavily. She looked up at him, a questioning, almost
fearful look in those ridiculously gorgeous eyes. The look was accompanied by
her wriggling as she tried to free her arms.

He was hit hard by a wall of guilt and released her hands. He was an asshole
and a criminal, he could admit that, but gorram it, he wasn't an animal. He
lifted himself off her, leaning back so her legs were free of his. He closed
his eyes and mentally berated himself for misreading her signals-but *ai ya*
it's hard to misread a hand petting that.

&quot;Silly tiger,&quot; she murmured. He opened his eyes and looked down at her again.
Her white panties were hanging from her finger, swaying just a little. She
dropped them next to her, then sat up to pull him back down onto her. As she
did, her legs spread instinctively, where his hips fit between them.

He closed his eyes, trying not to think about how thin his sleep pants were,
and how warm and wet she was against his erection. The fabric separating them
did very little, other than compress his already constricted penis. He tried
to keep his mind off that part of her, by leaning down to kiss her. He kissed
her neck, moving his way up to her ear. She giggled as his facial hair tickled
her skin, and made cute little purring sounds that only spurred him on. He
kissed his way to her cheek, just to the left of her mouth. She reached up and
turned his head so that his next kiss was to her lips. Gorram her lips were
soft. The kiss was needy and tentative all and once, and through his lusty
haze, Jayne got the distinct impression that at least part of her wasn't sure
about this. But, damn, she felt so good: soft in all the right places,
innocent and worldly at the same time, and, *lao tian yeh*, those eyes. He
tore himself away from her lips, having forgotten for a moment that he didn't
do that, and kissed his way back down her neck.

After a few more moments, he slid down her body, kissing the valley between her
breasts through the thin cloth. He reached down and pushed the fabric up,
exposing her body fully. For a second, he just stared. Perfect porcelain
skin, white mounds tipped with rosebud nipples, almost invisible hair trailing
from her flawless navel down to... *wo de ma*. Soft black curls hid the part
of her he wanted most. He felt himself get harder, and gorram, he didn't think
that was possible. River sighed, pulling his gaze back up to her face. She
blinked lazily, showing off the fact that her eyes had darkened slightly,
becoming even more hypnotic. She beckoned him with one finger, calling him to
her.

Powerless to resist her command, he slid back up her body, the heat between
them increasing. As his chest rubbed across them, he felt her nipples harden
further. The muscles in her stomach tightened in a quick spasm. The waistband
of his pants had fallen, exposing his hipbones, and the beginning of his public
hair. River grinned at him and reached down, fingers skating over his waist,
then sliding into his pants. Jayne sucked in a short breath as her small hands
pushed his pants down, freeing his erection.

Her legs were open, thighs holding his hips against hers. It took every ounce
of control Jayne could muster not to thrust immediately into her. The tip of
his cock brushed enticingly against hot, wet skin, and gorram it, she felt
amazing. He clenched his eyes shut and breathed in deeply, willing himself not
to screw this up. Not with her. Not again.

When he opened his eyes, she was looking up at him, unreadable again. &quot;River?&quot;
The word was a question, half a groan torn from his throat. Jayne knew he
could stop right now-if he told him he had to. But *lao tian yeh*, one more
moment, and he'd be lost for good.

&quot;Jayne.&quot; She whispered the unexpectedly lucid word into his ear, followed by a
quick nip of her teeth. It was all the encouragement he needed. With one hard
thrust, he was inside her and *wo de ma*, she was tight and warm. His eyes
never left hers, and he didn't miss the flash of pain as it crossed her face.
Gorram it, she was a virgin? If Jayne hadn't been so lost in the feeling of
her, he'd have smacked himself.

He waited, hovering above her, not withdrawing, until she started moving. He
thrust again, and watched her reaction. She seemed okay, more than okay. He
tried to go slow, but *tian sha* he was only a man, and not even a very
respectable one at that. Within moments, he'd struck up a rhythm, moaning in
time to it. River's nails clawed into his back, grunting and moaning with him.
He knew he wasn't far from coming, and he wanted to slow down, make it last,
because God only knew why she was here and when she might come again, and for
once he liked that the girl under him was tiny and breakable. But her moans
sounded like 'harder' and she'd thrown back her head, exposing her beautifully
slim neck, and his gorram back was bleeding where she held on to him, and he
didn't fucking care, he just cared about this feeling and how he wished it
would never stop, how he wanted to feel like this forever.

It wasn't long before the sensation in his gut clamped around his insides,
squeezing him in the most pleasurable ways. Stars exploded before his eyes as
he thrust into her one last time, burying himself completely inside her. His
body shuddered, and he collapsed onto her, his arms refusing to hold his weight
any longer. He breathed heavily into her ear as she petted his hair.

Jayne knew he was heavy, and after only a few seconds, attempted to roll off
her. River shook her head, using her now-bloody hands to keep him on top and
inside her. &quot;Mmmm.&quot; The sound was that of a contented cat, and made Jayne
feel good. Her nuzzling his neck and nipping at his collarbone made him feel
even better. He didn't think she'd come, but she seemed content,
regardless.

After what seemed like an eternity, he rolled off of her. He wasn't sure what
he was supposed to do now, but he certainly wasn't going to kick River out of
his bed. She seemed in no hurry to leave, either, snuggling close to his
larger, warmer body, curled up like a cat in front on a hearth. He fell asleep
wrapped around her, happy, but vaguely confused now that his lust was sated.
She may have been a basket case, but he admitted that he liked her anyway, and
he wasn't sure what this was supposed to be.

The next morning, Jayne woke alone, River's spot cold. At first he thought it
was all just a dream-a very vivid, very good dream. But as he crawled out onto
the floor, her found her discarded panties and grinned. Not a dream, then.

He showered and dressed, then headed down to the mess for breakfast. He sat
across from River. She caught his eye and slowly shook her head, bringing her
finger to her lips. She clearly wanted to keep this a secret, and Jayne was
certainly willing to comply. Explaining why he'd fucked their cargo-their
gorgeous, crazy cargo-to Mal and getting thrown out the airlock was not high on
his list of priorities. And he wasn't in any particular hurry to explain to
Simon why his little sister might not be walking as gracefully for a couple
days. He tried not to stare at her during breakfast, but she was so poised and
nimble, even while just eating. This might be a little bit harder than he
expected. He watched her skip out of the mess, not as active as she'd been
yesterday. Jayne grinned possessively, knowing that he was the reason for
that, and remembering the pleasure of the night before.

***

River sat on a chair, watching her brother clean surgical implements in the
infirmary later that day. &quot;Simon.&quot; Her voice was so soft he didn't hear it.
&quot;Simon,&quot; she said louder.

Her brother turned. &quot;Yes, River?&quot; Exhaustion was evident in his voice.

River cocked her head, then looked him in the eye. &quot;We're safe. Not going to
get stupid again. I turned the tiger into my puppy. Mine.&quot; She stood up and
glided toward the door, turning only once she was there. &quot;Simon. You need
more sleep.&quot; She turned and skipped out.
