My '55 beloved Champion engine is sick, and it's driving me batsh*t
trying to track it down. The engine has a great big dead spot in it's
powerband, right off idle it loses power and will grind to a halt when
under load, but if the engine has no load on it the engine will rev all
the way up into the redline, where ever that's at, no problem. So far
I've taken the Carter WE carb apart, blew out all the passages &amp; jets
and reassmbled it with a kit from Studebakers West which made it idle
and start on a cold frosty morning much better, but still the dead
spot. The distributer diaphram appears to have no rupture, the points
and condenser have been replaced recently, and I can't find any point
where the tiny wire inside may ground out. The only other thing that I
can think of trying is to re-install the old condenser, and if that
doesn't work, try the old points again.

Does anyone have any other thoughts?
Best regards to all,
Chris Houck

Sounds like fuel starvation.  Do you have an in-line filter- could be
clogged?  The fuel pump may be very weak.  You could have a clogged or
pinched gas line.  Maybe your float level is too low.

look at vacuum lines and their termination components for an issue that
would cause an off-idle vacuum leak.

CHECK THE FUEL PUMP and filter if you have one.Sounds like its starving
under load.

Have you checked the timing advance mechanism?

When I had my gas station in the early 70's I ran into a similar
problem.  When the car was in the bay it would rev smooth and give no
indication of any problem.  I would shut the hood go for a ride and
before I went a block it would lose power and stall.  Seems the hood
insulation was falling down and blocking the air intake.

If you didn't rebuild the carb with a new, supple, expanded,
accelerator pump diaphram...I'd have guessed that to be the
problem...if I understand your symptoms right.  And many times kits
have had wrong diameter diaphrams too.
And for discussion only:  If you have a dead spot as you've described,
isn't there enough gas in the carb to rule out the fuel pump ?  I'd
guess carb pump or vacuum.....

I would also suggest checking the two rubber fuel hoses (one at tank and one
at fuel pump) for deteriation and possibly collapsing under suction and
causing a restriction.

I had this stalling problem on my 1955 Champion.  The jet at the bottom
of the float bowl, (under the 1/4" screen &amp; circlip) was plugged, on
mine.  I also found I needed to replace the vent flap at the top of the
carburetor, as the rubber had cracked.  If that flap doesn't seal, the
accelerator pump doesn't function properly, even if you have a new
leather plunger.  I would suggest following the setup procedure in the
Studebaker Shop Manual, as this carb is a little sensitive to settings
being off.  Mine now runs flawlessly.  KK

Just a bit more of a clarification, under that screen, (which is
actually located below the accelerator pump plunger) is a small one-way
check ball, which on mine was partially corroded.  The symptoms were
identical to yours.  I had thought initially it was an electrical
problem, but it was not a problem in the distributor.
