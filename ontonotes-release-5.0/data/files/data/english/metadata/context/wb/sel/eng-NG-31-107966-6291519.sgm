My book on how not to need search and rescue is finally published.  I
lost my publisher to a brain aneurysm so decided to publish first
electronically.  Those interested can download it (for a price of
course) from http://www.mobipocket.com .  First download their reader
software (free) and make sure they have a version for your computer.
They support Windows and most hand-helds but do not support Mac or
Linux.

The book next has three chapters navigation, preparation and other
topics to help the reader avoid trouble. Decision-making is emphasized,
something not found in most similar books.

Next comes a chapter on what to do if you do get lost or injured,
followed by one on how search teams work. The final chapter is a
flagrant recruiting brochure for search and rescue volunteers, complete
with information on how to get involved.

There three appendices, the first describing some mapping issues. This
includes some of the problems caused by using a flat map to represent a
roughly spherical earth, and the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
system. The second appendix describes several means of communication
that would be useful for calling for help in the backcountry. Finally,
another appendix describes some dangers found in the wilderness.

I would assume your book has a title and an author. Mind sharing it with

Oops!  You are right I neglected to include that information which is
somewhat important.

_Bringing Yourself Back Alive_ by Hal Lillywhite
ISBN 978-1-4243-2438-5

Thank you for pointing that out.  A search for either the title or

You'll notice that he forgot to give the name of the book and didn't
include a bunch of phony credentials and a page long sig file
aggrandizing himself.  He made a simple announcement.  Not the same as
Len, obviously.

And he posts to rec.backcountry often enough that I recognized the

He corrected that oversite in his next post and he has anonymous 'sock
puppets' posting his credentials as well as stating he thinks he is
'published' by doing it electronically on the Internet.

He also states he is 'published' in a format that only Windoze users can
see if they download the 'special' software from the site!

It is 'not' for Linux or Mac's, because the trojans and spyware in the
'special' software won't work on either of them eh!

Now see this is only because his publisher died right?  Ya right!

The gent might be legit, or it's a sucker call for trojan and spyware
testers.

If he is legit, someone has sure given him bad advise.

Just my $0.02,

Hal is a long time poster.
I have met Hal following one of my Portland area meetings.
While he is of the mold of Pacific NW hikers/snow climbers
(the Mazama variety), who get gruff from other parts of the country,
I would say that Hal know his stuff and local terrain.
Hal knows his limitations.  He supposedly maintains the snake panel.  ;^)

As to the question of whether Hal is spamming the group: I would say not.
Simple announcement is right.  He understands the net (mostly), he has
participated in discussion (not that that is a requirement).  And he
gives good local info (corresponds to stuff I knew).

While I have met Hal, I have not met Len.  I have been near his terrain (MI)
on business trips as well.

Let me think of the similiarities:
Both snow shoe.
....
Humm.  Hal wanders forested hills and mountains and snowy volcanos.
He doesn't go (likely much) to Smith Rock or much on much to Columbia
river crags (but he likely knows rope work quite reasonably).

Len has Michigan.  Long winters.  Militas, etc.

Neither are Harvey Manning or Yvon Chouinard.  ;^)
OR Whitaker (both of them) or Robbins, or other authors
of books, or Brown (various, how's that for ambiguity?) for that matter.

Hal has figured out how repeat himself in r.b. monthly with a minimum of
work and integrate himself as part of the community.

I would not quite use the word advertising.  Broadcasting: yes.

That's ambiguous enough that I am uncertain how to read that.
Numerically:
Something like &gt;25 lines of attribution and 2 lines of comment.

Qualitatively:
Hal is possibly the most senior and experienced at posting on Usenet
and his outdoor skills of the 3 of you.
Followed by the net.vixen (who has sharp teeth).  She is good.
Mike is still a bit new as evidenced by his post but has picked up
good posting skills for a 4x4er and machine recreator (not as sharp as
the past Victor or my co-worker Bob).

You, the door's still open.  You have the potential to be good or bad.
Do you have class?  I have no idea.  You are still more welcome to post
(but what? you can change that).  Are you going to go away bored?  No idea.
Are you going to be missed?  At this stage, no.

The storage on Usenet mostly gets recycled.
That's a technical problem we who run the net have to deal with.
Hal's post was no big deal.

This is already too long, but it's an assessment of all of you.
Hal is good enough to be picked for public comment on
technical internet directions.  Cyli, too.  Mike, with time.

Seeing as I am making the noise, I will volunteer.   My computer is
pretty safely set up and it tracks all installs, good stuff or spyware.

Your book's website sets off Netscape and Norton's alarms by the way.
It says the site isn't a trusted site and gives a verisign 'certificate
revocation list' warning and it sets a cookie that lasts until the year
2038.

I know a far bit about the bush and like to read.  I am currently stuck
home most of the time trying to recover from being a passenger in a
passenger side T-bone hit so have lot of time to read also.

I will give your book a fair read.

&gt;Next comes a chapter on what to do if you do get lost or injured,
&gt;followed by one on how search teams work. The final chapter is a
&gt;flagrant recruiting brochure for search and rescue volunteers, complete
&gt;with information on how to get involved.

&gt;There three appendices, the first describing some mapping issues. This

(search for my name) put there by the Technical University of Mexico
(not sure if I have the name exactly right).  They updated it with
better information and gave it a bulletin number, along with
translating it to their language.  I think they may have also added
some information on snakes found in their country (which can be more
deadly than some of their equivalents in the US.

Nope. Len doesn't have Michigan. Michigan has Len. The Upper Peninsula is

demand a 47th place draft pick in return. No negotiation on that last part.

That's fine.
I grew up in CA with family from MT and UT and HI.
I have my less than favorable impressions of MI from friends who grew
up there and travels.  I feel sorry for you, but that doesn't change the

there (Len).  Let them stay there, encourage them to stay there (or Vail).
I am reminded of the HS kids I saw doing ROTC drills (in IL, too).

Detriot reminds me a bit of Pittsburgh, but less hilly.

Review of Bringing Yourself Back Alive by Hal Lillywhite
========================================================

Overview
--------
The author want to give the reader enough information to not get lost. In
case the reader gets lost the author provides an outline on how to survive
a short time in bad weather/cold/snow (using real and invented cases), and
how to generate clues to aid rescuers.

Medium
------
The book has been published as an eBook readable only via the Mobipocket
Reader.  I could not find a build-in way to print or export the book to
other formats. The book is relatively brief. Due to its electronic nature
it is hard to compare to traditional formats, but I would say 100 to 130
pages. The book also features 37 images. Many of these images appear tiny
on my (high res) laptop screen.  The reader makes it very impractical to
zoom into them (and hence relatively useless for me). I also find browsing
with the reader confusing, as it appears to skip pages sometimes. It is
possible to select and copy text but it is not possible to search for a
word.

Chapters
--------
Chapter 1 - Don't get lost
Good intro on mental navigation, maps and compass.

Chapter 2 - Gettin' Ready
Ten essentials, clothing, pointers to wilderness medicine books.
Pretty standard stuff.

Chapter 3 - Technical Navigation
Compass, Altimeter, GPS
Standard stuff. Personally I mostly navigate using an altimeter.
I feel it is more convenient than a compass in the mountains (except
maybe for whiteouts, where I don't have experience).

Chapter 4 - I'm Lost, Now What?
Nicely worked out what to do and not to do based on examples.

Chapter 5 - How Search Teams Work
Now, for me this is the interesting part of the book. What happens
behind the scenes and how to generate clues.

Chapter 6 - So You Want to Join SAR?
Not really. Begging for donations, tax issues and being bossed around by
the local Sheriff?

Appendices

Some observations
-----------------
* The author assumes that you live near Mount Hood and want to be rescued
in Oregon. Some of the advice is controversial (which he admits). He
suggests rationing food and water. "If you have no way to purify it you
may be better off thirsty for a couple of days." This would be bad advice
for the desert. As this book tells you how to survive 3-5 days until
rescues get you, water borne illnesses should be the least concern of the
victim (IMHO).

* The technical explanations do not go deep enough into the matter for my
taste. "For example, Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood is in zone 10 at
0601236 easting and 5020289 northing. That means that if I start from the
southwest corner of zone 10 (on the equator) and go 0601236 meters to the
east, then 5020289 meters north I will be at Timberline lodge."
What if I go 5020289 meters north and then 0601236 meters east, will I
still be at Timberline lodge?

Conclusion
----------
I believe the current book is work in progress. It is an interesting, but
short read. Many of the chapters are somewhat overlapping. Maybe the
author is trying to drive certain points home with repetition. Other
issues are handled very brief. Good references are given instead. I would
like to see a clearer structure. I hope it could be reworked and more
good/bad cases of rescues added (as these are actually interesting - think
"Over the edge - Death in the CG" etc.) Higher resolution images would be
nice.

I believe a beginner could learn valuable lessons from the book. One can
notice the experience of the author that is written down in several good
observations and advice. This, plus chapter 5, should be interesting to
the advanced hiker.  But the price for the eBook is relatively steep
considering its current form, shape and digital rights management issues.
For this reason I believe that the audience will be somewhat limited.

Good Review Ilja.  Can you go a bit further?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Chapter 1 - Don't get lost

&gt; Chapter 4 - I'm Lost, Now What?
">

I maintain that the crux of the issue lies between
these two points in time.

My first comment on this thread was "Nobody expects the
Spanish Inquisition", which nobody commented on,
perhaps because nobody made the connection.   So let
me make it now: Nobody *expects* to get lost.

Does Hal address this concept?  If not, it's a major omission.

This lack of expectation is perhaps the greatest reason
that people are delayed in reaching, or never get to,
"Chapter 4".  In other words, admitting that "I'm lost!"  is
the crux of whether you get yourself out successfully, or
get sucked into the downward spiral towards death.
Does Hal address this?

I know from my own experiences and those of my friends
that maintaining an awareness of "I could get lost here and
now", based on certain clues, is a *learned* thing.  Does
Hal discuss this?

If Hal doesn't address these issues in the book, then all
the GPS, maps, etc. are just band-aids to the real issues.
Like GW Bush and his approach to Iraq: There are tactics
but no strategy.

Thanks for posting this Ilja.  I will make a few updates soon (as I

that, as I understand it, Mobipocket allows you to download it again

Closer to 200 when it looked like it would be in paper (and I hope it

That is one thing I don't like about the Mobipocket format.  They take
my images (most of which are 5 or 7 megabytes) and shrink them to fit
their format.  That is probably because their prime target market is
the hand-held devices but it would be nice if they allowed better
resolution for desktops and laptops.  I'll make that suggestion to
then buy don't hold your breath, they don't tend to move very fast on
such things.

Actually they do have a word search that sort of works.  In the upper
right hand corner if you're not in the whole screen mode is where it
lives.  My experience is that it works the first time, but if you try
a second search in the same session it often fails.

Pricing is something I spent quite a bit of time thinking about.  The
issue is not only my profits but how people regard the book.  I could
have sold it for $2 but people tend to regard a cheap book as , well
cheap.  They often don't pay attention to it.  It's a trade-off
between sales vs how seriously people take the book and profit.  Did I
pick the exact right number?  Highly unlikely.  Did I pick a
reasonable price for the trade-offs?  I think so but I could well be
wrong.

I do but you have a good point and I can place more emphasis on that
point.  As you say, it is important.

Chapter 1 starts with a made up quote attributed to "almost any lost
person."  "This is the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not
to me."

Then follows:

"After 20 years in search and rescue, I have a word of advice about
getting lost or injured: Don't.
"Don't get lost or injured because:

"Your family and friends will be worried like you wouldn't believe.

"You will be scared - and you will probably have good reason to be
scared.

"You will likely be cold, hungry, and quite miserable before we find
you - and we may not find you at all.

"And finally - I'm getting too old to get out of bed in the middle of
the night to go look for you."

I do think however that I can place more emphasis on the fact that
getting lost is something that can happen to anybody and people should
not be overconfident.  I'll add that probably within a few days and
upload the book again.

&gt; &gt; Review of Bringing Yourself Back Alive by Hal Lillywhite

&gt; Good Review Ilja.  Can you go a bit further?

&gt; &gt; Chapter 1 - Don't get lost

&gt; &gt; Chapter 4 - I'm Lost, Now What?

&gt; I maintain that the crux of the issue lies between
&gt; these two points in time.

Sort of. I think that the real issue is the difference
between being "lost" (ie. hopelessly unaware of your
location with respect to some useful place) and being "not
where you expected to be" (ie. "Damn, where am I? Let's
figure this out.").

Typically, people who can use skills and experience and
tools to figure out where they are even if it's not where
they thought they were don't actually get "lost". People
whose idea of navigation is to follow the trail until they
get to the campsite or the car -- these are the people who
do end up "lost".

What's the worst case difference?

The USGS maps that I use have an extra set of tick marks in the
corners.  I don't remember seeing any that are off far enough
to make a significant difference.  (But I don't check them very
often.)

I don't use a GPS.

I've never matched GPS coordinates to a map.  Sounds old school, before the
color screen mapping GPSs.  I generally find myself relying on waypoints, or
built in maps.  I might use a real map, when available, to get the big
picture.  If the situation is difficult, a lot of waypoints on the screen
often paint a picture that can easily be matched to a map.

Got through another white-out about 3 weeks ago (near 19k in a storm, I
might add).  My next wand was maybe only ~250 ft away and I had a GPS
waypoint right on it.  It marked the only passage through a shrund with
drops everywhere else.  I don't think I had much of a chance of getting to
it any other way, certainly not very quickly.  Visibility was maybe 15 feet.
After dropping through the shrund, I had about 1cm of water ice plastered to
my body.  A guide and 2 clients were huddled under a tarp around 18k because
they lost their wand trail.  Tracks were either filled in or blown away.
This was the third white-out I've gotten through with GPS aid.  So, I'm
becoming rather fond of mine.

A small thing Hal:
Your title is close to Robert Pelton's book
Come Back Alive and his associated web site.
Robert is now a major player of sorts on the world scene.
He's not the kind of guy to get on people's cases for infringement,
but you should be mindful of the closeness of your titles.

I don't know what the "worst case" is, but a few hundred
meters is common. As you mention, some of the USGS maps have
ticks for the newer grid. You could use those to see what
the difference is.

Obviously a couple hundred meters could be negligible, but
it also could be crucial if you are looking for a small but
specific spot like a descent gully or a particular pass or
something like that. It can also be enough for you to
misidentify some feature (like a trail or a creek) that you
then follow to the wrong place.

It's simple enough, really. Just make sure you look at the
fine print on your map and see what datum they are using,
then set your GPS to use that same datum. The problem is,
most GPS units use WGS84 by default, but the USGS 7.5 quads
use NAD27 (or at least, they did last I bought any).

Mapping software that has the USGS info (like TOPO!) can
(like GPS units themselves) usually be set for either one.

I think you still miss the point.

So you were "overconfident" if you get lost?  Well, sorry, that's
an armchair quarterback approach and not worth teaching.

People with no navigation skills and tools get lost.  People
with excellent navigation skills and tools get lost.  Clearly, nav
skills aren't the deciding factor.  The deciding factor is the
decision process you use.

For example, you can go into the backcountry without a map,
compass, gps, etc. and not get lost.   You decide, up front,  to
bound your actions enough to be able to get out at the end
of the day.  This can be as simple as deciding to stay on the
trail, or to build cairns every 50 ft.  This requires great discipline
and severely limits what you can do and where you can go.
Clearly this isn't done often.

What most people do is just the opposite.  They set a goal,
then take any action that comes to mind to reach it, and rely
on their navigation skills and tools to bail them out when the
weather turns to shit, or the trail gives out.  And there lies the
rub, because even with all the bells and whistles, and good
skills, people still get lost.

For example, if Nate hadn't had the foresight to put a waypoint
on that wand (see his post) he very well could of been screwed,
even with a GPS, and knowing how to use it.

The thing that keeps you from getting lost is the decision
process you use to limit your actions (or, as in Nate's case,
taking a certain action) factoring in the environment and
your nav skills and tools.

That sounds high falutin, but for most people it boils down
to cultivating an awareness of changes to the environment
(e.g. storm moving in), and an acceptance of "Gee, even
with this map, GPS, cell phone, etc.  I COULD STILL GET
LOST".

Properly cultivated (eg. learned)  that little warning bell
goes off in your head not too soon and not too late to
stop, figure out where you are, and most importantly
decide if you should do something differently.

I could go on, but this is long enough.  Maybe I'll write a book.

"Damn, where am I? " is *definitely* between Chapter 1
