Two Japanese climbers - a man and a woman - died as they descended
Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, but a lucky break saved
a third climber.

The 31-year-old woman, Meguru Inoue, was abseiling down the mountain
below her companions on Wednesday night when the rock they were all
anchored to gave way, starting a landslide and plunging her and
Takao Futono, 52, nearly 500 metres to their deaths, police said.

The third climber, a 28-year-old man, survived when a falling rock
severed the rope connecting him to the others, and saved him from
being pulled down with them, said Constable Carl Pedersen.

this was not a movie. ALmost not possible to cut the rope, when such
incident occurs (only cliffhanger can do it). Belive me, I know what I'm
talking about.

i read the story Hal mentioned.  and it gave me a brain cramp.

for as i always do when i hear details of a climbing accident, i tried
to picture it all in the camera obscura of my minds eye.  not to be a
ghoul, or to make mighty 'experte' comments, but simply in the hope of
learning enough to perhaps save me from the same fate.  for while i
suspect that soon enough i'll blow something massively while hanging off
of something somewhere, and with that suddenly cease to exist, i do have
this lingering hope that when i do it will not prove just a boring
re-run, but rather a new and truly creative fookup.  ah, vanity.

the first round of news blurbs described the three as being roped
together, even as one of them rapped.  so i'm thinking, unusual but
possible.  perhaps they were descending roped and came upon a fixed rap
line.  i can recall an odd time or two when i've done that while
descending roped with a partner and coming upon a single fixed rap line
-- as it was simply faster to stay roped rather than untie/coil/retie
(we wanted to stay roped at the other end of the rap).  so ok, maybe,
sure.

then as the woman raps, the anchor blows out in a wad of rockfall.  a
wad large enough to bowl two of them a good way down the mountain, yet
small enough to spare the lucky third climber.  um, ok, sure.  rockfall
is nothing if not applied chaos theory (best not to be 'a strange
attractor')

and, oh yeah, this wad of rockfall just happens to include this one
remarkable rock that cuts cleanly through the rope leading to the lucky
third guy, such that he is miraculously spared from getting pulled off
with his pals.  my brain kinda went TILT at that part.

sure, falling rocks do cut ropes (once had a front row seat to watch a
big blodgett vhooper slice a haulbag off a 5mm line.  that sucked.
turns out the only thing worse than hauling too fat a pig on too thin a
line is suddenly having no fat pig to haul at all)

but the rope's gotta be pretty darn taut.  and the rock pretty sharp,
angled just so, and really sailing.  a lead rope taut enough to be cut,
rather than just dented, would almost surely be taut enough to pluck the
survivor off the cliffband in a heartbeat.

so in all the scene presented in those first news reports reminded me of
Rosencrantz flipping that coin for days on end in the film "Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern Are Dead" (one of my faves) -- and getting heads every
time.  as in, well, statistically possible, but stunningly unlikely.
too many 'heads' all in a row.

as for the guy cutting his own rope, this might make for a good base
camp tequila mixer, but naaaaahhhhhh.  what climber hangs out with a
knife at the ready for such an instant?  certainly not anyone i'd ever
wanna climb with.  even Rambo, with one of those silly 6lb Ramboni
broadsword/'survival knife' oddities in his teeth (and absolutely no
conscience) couldn't slice a rope that fast.   naaaaaahhhhhh.
~~~

so i searched the web a bit (tried using all three of their last names
at once) and found a bit more detail on this accident in a couple NZ
based newspapers.  none especially detailed, some down right silly.  but
at least a bit more more detail.

perhaps the best of this ho-hum lot is this one from "The Press" (outta
christchurch, if memory serves).
http://www.stuff.co.nz/westcoast/3941187a11.html

the crux of this article includes:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He [sole survivor] told rescuers all three climbers were attached
">

&gt; by a sling to another sling around a fridge-sized rock near the
&gt; summit.  The rock gave way [...] started a rockslide in which his

&gt; saving him from being pulled down with them. The sling
&gt; has friction-burn marks.
[...]
&gt; He told rescuers all three climbers were attached by a sling to
&gt; another sling around a fridge-sized rock near the summit.

still struck me as kinda off the likely mark.  as i pondered it, i
dreamed up a variant, if only to squelch the TILT buzzers ringing in my
head.  pynchon harps on the human drive to forever find meaning in
chaos.  for that matter, laurence sterne did an even better job of it
about 400 years ago, as uncle toby gets his leg blown off by a cannon
ball, then spends the rest of his life studying geometry and ballistics
trying to figure out precisely why.

call me Uncle Toby...

*** NOTE: what follows is pure SPECULATION, simply my best GUESS ***

the survivor said the three of them "were attached by a sling to another
sling."   as such, how about this, given my experiences in the
mountains, perhaps more likely scenario:

the trio come upon an in-situ sling around "a fridge sized" block.
clearly one would have to sacrifice a lot of webbing (or equivalent) to
wrap around a block that big, so they decide to just use the existing
(in-situ) sling already around the fridge.  in retrospect, likely a very
bad idea, but i wouldn't dare judge them as how many times have i done
precisely the same thing.  especially on a long mountain route where
available gear is limited and you (may) have to spread what gear you do
have over a whole lot of descent.

for i suspect that the "friction-burn" was due to them using an existing
(in-situ) rap sling -- the burn being left when the the party who
originally placed the sling pulled down their rap line.  we've all seen
such slings.  for unless its fresh lava, i simply don't see rockfall
'burning' a sling.

they then attach another sling.  perhaps to better their chance for a
smooth rope retrieval.  perhaps to get the rope off a sharp edge.  or
perhaps just to make the belay for those waiting to rap less awkward.
whatever.  what is important is that we do know they attached a sling to
a sling.

(fwiw, the fact there were two slings seems to me more evidence they
used an existing sling already wrapped around the 'fridge' -- for if
they had run their own sling around the fridge presumably they'd make it
as long as they wanted rather than go to the trouble of adding a second
sling to lengthen their own work.  though i guess i have to remember
that my habit of taking a loooong wad of sacrificial sling stock when on
mountain routes and cutting and tying them to whatever length needed is
fast becoming rather old school in this day of schwank prefab brand name
sewn runners.  to my eye, most of the current crop of cragside mall
children have likely never seen a hand tied sling let alone tied one of
their own.  whatever.)

so anyway, they run the rap rope(s) through a second sling either girth
hitched or just tied in a loop linked through the sling around the
fridge block.  of the two guys, one clips into this same second sling
that the rap line is running through.  while the other guy (the
survivor) clips into the _other_ sling, the big one wrapped around the
fridge.  why?  perhaps because each of them simply clipped into whatever
point was most comfortable relative to where they were standing at the
rap station.  or perhaps just standard chaos theory.

anyway, the lady of the group starts rapping.  suddenly the big in-situ
sling around the fridge fails under her weight on the rap line.  for (in
my vision) this sling is getting dry and crunchy with UV and has been
rope burned by at least one previous party.  poof.  with this the woman
rapping is, sadly, toast.  also toast is anyone clipped into that same
second sling her rap line was running through.  as i'm guessing the guy
who sailed with her was.

but if, as i'm guessing, the survivor, alone, is clipped into the sling
that failed (the big one around the fridge), he'd just be left standing
on the ledge -- albeit in a truly nightmarish situation.

in this scenario, any subsequent rockfall would be caused by the
tumbling climbers and rap rope -- hence all below the survivor.  as such
it doesn't bowl him out.

*** end of pure SPECULATION / GUESS ***
(at least this tidbit)

time will tell.  or more likely, not.  perhaps just going through the
possibilities is all the learning curve this tragedy offers.  i mourn
for the survivor even more than his pals.  i wish him that peace Karl
Baba speaks of.
~~~

that same article included much of the goofiness that such articles
written by non-climbers invariably pander.  but then we all have our
frontiers.  i imagine if they had me write an article on some Parisian
Fashion Show, or Curling for that matter, the results would be equally
laughable.

if nothing else, let's hope no newbie uses that article as a climbing
'how-to' guide.  for it contains such potentially suicidal gems as:

&gt; the anchor rock may have already had slings around it, indicating it
&gt; was a safe anchor point.

how many times have you seen a nest of rap slings on something truly
treacherous (often with something far better close at hand)?   like
marginal little bushes (who are having a hard enough time without
drooling bipeds hanging on them).  and flakes that go
"boooiiioooiiiiooong when you tap on them.  of course i once rapped off
a gaz cannister kicked into fist crack.  proof i'm quite capable of
being stupid and environmentally tasteless in one fell swoop.  i hope to
make amends and go back someday and retrieve that mistake.  only 7,000
miles from Here.     roadtrip...

&gt; it was possible the rock was firm to the touch, but not firm enough
&gt; in the high-level freezing conditions to take the weight of abseiling.

outside of the garden of the gods, isn't all rock "firm to the touch"?
me, i'm thinking that it's not so much if a rock is "firm" -- it's
whether it's actually attached to, like, the rest of the cliff.  no?

i can see it now, "yeah Omar, we're good to go, dude, for this rock is
firm to the touch.  BTW, howsa'bout you rap first..."

sheesh
~~~

as i searched for the above articles, i stumbled upon some other gems.
among them the burmese python that ate 11 dogs (YIKES!).  and, oh yeah,

Here is a bit of a variation, although I haven't been following closely
enough to know if
the reported details fully support it.

3 people come upon a slung boulder (or sling one themselves).  They all clip
into the sling.  The first starts to rap, the second moves into position
underneath the boulder in order to be ready to set up their rappel once the
first is done, and the third sits further back or to the side of the
boulder, to wait his turn.

The boulder fails, and starts to slide.  The rappeller and the man directly
beneath the boulder are done for, but as the rock slides/roles, it shreds
the slings that were wrapped around it, leaving the third climber off belay,
but quite securely on the ledge.

Have there been any details that counterindicate any of that?  I know there
is something about a second sling, but that can be added into this scenario
without really altering it.

hell, i spent an entire evening tracking all of the available 'reported
details' and i'm still befuddled.  but then befuddled is clearly my base
state.

sure Simon, your read on what most likely happened is certainly as good
as my guess -- and likely better -- as the sole survivor (he's chosen to
remain unnamed and with that avoid Oprah and Geraldo, smart guy) clearly
emphasized rockfall.  as such it makes sense to focus on that.

as i said, consider all the variants, learn what you can, then move on.
~~~

at present i'm busy doing yet another elite accident investigation --
this one on my own self.  in this instance pondering precisely what
inspired me to write 20 paragraphs on an ultimately unknowable and as
such largely uninformative accident.  and in public...  arghhh.  mia
maxima culpa.  perhaps i should get a day job...

naaaah.

weird shit simply happens -- especially when you're tired, up high, and
playing with ropes and gravity.  this is the downside of an otherwise
excellent game.  (and fwiw, one of the reasons why the aiguille du midi
will always be especially fond in my memories.  exquisite alpine granite
where you top out, burp, then get on the telepherique and rocket down to
a crisp campari and soda in town.  ah, la dolce vita!  wait, that's not
french.  er, la bon vie!

this from a guy who, last fall, soloed this, well, fairly big and
certainly beautiful (though hardly celebrity league) mountain.   and
made it back down just fine.  then i went to town and got promptly got
run over by a random taxi.  Uncle Toby, limping and wondering...

canis fidelus...

Yeah, not sure of the last time I heard of someone remaining tied in to
rappel.  I think the whole "rope" thing is probably just second and third
hand reporting, perhaps through a few non-climbers.

But, having been present for a few too close rockfalls, I can say that they
can be very violent and capable of shredding and completely destroying any
piece of climbing equipment.  I would also characterize the alpine rock
around Cook in NZ to be "sharp".  The joys of warm weather up high are often
coupled with the dangers of rocks coming unglued.  Beyond that, the details
of what they were doing with their slings and ropes doesn't really matter
much to me.

This one is definitely a campfire conversation starter, especially
considering the lack of detail.

But the one question I haven't seen posed is... What on earth were they
doing still descending at 9pm? I was in the area in mid-Dec.: Being a
decent way south, the sun's up early and by mid-morning things are
already getting pretty unsettled. By early afternoon it's slush and
crap's falling all over the place.

My thoughts: Survivor had a girth-hitched sling attached via krab to
fixed/discarded sling around anchor that looked "safe". (You'd have
hoped the first and second descents were done with the sling backed up
by some other protection which was cleaned by the final climber after
the sling proved "safe", but no media coverage seems to suggest this?).
The fixed sling was cut by the rock-fall as it was under tension and the
"friction" marks are from a number of previous people rap-ing off it in
the same position.
