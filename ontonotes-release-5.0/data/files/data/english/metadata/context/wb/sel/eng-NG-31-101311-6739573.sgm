Australia to use DAB+ for Digital Radio Rollout

Mar 14, 2007

Commercial radio broadcasters today announced they will adopt the new
DAB+ standard for the implementation of digital radio in Australia.
DAB+ is the new standard for the Eureka 147 platform using advanced
audio codec (AAC+).  It was officially approved by international
standards body ETSI in February.

The chief executive officer of industry body Commercial Radio
Australia, Joan Warner, said DAB+ would provide a better digital radio
experience for listeners.

"We have been very active in supporting the international development
of DAB+ because it means Australia will be able to adopt the latest,
most spectrum efficient technology in the world for the roll out of
our digital radio services," Ms Warner said.

DAB+ is two to three times more efficient than the original Eureka 147
standard which uses the MPEG Audio Layer II coding.  This means radio
stations will have more choice in how they use their allocated
bandwidth.

"DAB+ offers much more efficient compression, which means more
stations can be broadcast on a multiplex, resulting in lower per
station transmission costs," Ms Warner said.

"It also means each broadcaster will now have the ability to deliver
either superior audio quality, split their signal to offer two or
three audio channels, or broadcast a combination of better than FM
quality sound plus lots of associated data such as text or images.
Whichever way stations choose to implement digital radio, the result
will be a better service for listeners and advertisers."

Ms Warner said commercial radio was continuing to work with the ABC
and SBS Radio to test the DAB+ standard in Australia and to ensure
there will be no transmission or other technical issues.  The industry
is also working with overseas broadcasters and receiver and chip
manufacturers on the development of new DAB+ receivers.

DAB+ services and receivers are expected to be rolled out in a number
of countries where digital radio is currently in trial phase, which
potentially includes the Netherlands, Malta, New Zealand, India and
China.

"We want to encourage the availability of a wide range of affordable
digital radio receivers with new features such as picture capability,"
Ms Warner said.  "Some leading manufacturers have told us that they
expect to start shipping DAB+ radios later this year."The Federal
Government is currently drafting digital radio legislation and has set
a launch date of 1 January 2009 for the launch of digital radio
services in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart.
The commercial radio industry is planning for a phased rollout across
the rest of Australia to follow.
