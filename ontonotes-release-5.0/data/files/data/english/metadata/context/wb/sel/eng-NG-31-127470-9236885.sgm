The 9-11 Passenger List Oddity
by Vincent Sammartino - WING TV.com

As everyone who is involved in exposing the 9-11 cover-up knows,
nothing concerning 9-11 is as it seems. Whether it's the magic jet
that our government told us crashed into the Pentagon, the obvious
missing jet at Shanksville (Flight 93), the three perfect demolitions
of the World Trade Center towers, or the fact that Arab hijackers are
still alive and their supposed ring leader Osama bin Laden has the
ability to change his facial features at will. Nothing, I repeat,
nothing about the government/controlled media version of 9-11 makes
any sense.

So, let's get one thing straight and out of the way right now. There
are no such things as physical inconsistencies in the world we live
in. We can always depend on the laws of physics to be consistent and
unchanging. Coincidence is a self-contained human concept; and the
real world - the atoms, molecules and planets that whiz around - don't
care if you understand them. Likewise, they aren't concerned if their
movement happens to favor you or not. I say this because, as Victor
Thorn and Lisa Guliani know (WING TV), this is the key to
understanding what is real and what is contrived.

With that said, let me go back to sometime in February, 2004. At that
time I had pretty much figured out that what had happened at the
Pentagon and the WTC was a lie. I was still toying with the idea,
though, that maybe (just maybe) our government had shot down Flight 93
in Shanksville in order to protect us from the real terrorists.

Then a few websites started to pop-up showing videos of what appeared
to be a &quot;pod&quot; under Flight 175, along with an unexplained flash that
happened just before the jet hit the South Tower. To me, this was just
as damning as the Pentagon and the WTC collapses. There is no good
reason for us to be seeing what we saw if the official government
story was true. Think about this point for a minute. If what we saw
was just an anomaly, then there must be millions of photos/videos of
757s taking off and landing at airports all over the world that look
JUST LIKE THAT! If anybody has any jet photo anomalies they would like
to share with us, please send them to Victor and Lisa at WING TV so we
can clear this stuff up.

Which brings me to Ellen Mariani: she's the woman who lost her husband
Louis on Flight 175 that crashed into the South Tower on 9-11. With
the help of a lawyer named Phil Berg, she filed a lawsuit against
President Bush and company under the RICO act. Also, she refused to
take the hush money that was offered to her under the 9-11 Victims
Compensation fund.

In addition, I had just discovered Black Op Radio earlier in the year
and found an interesting show in their archives (# 156) on which Ellen
and Mr. Berg appeared as guests. This may be the single biggest point
concerning 9-11, and hopefully the last nail in the coffin of our
government's lies. During this broadcast, Mrs. Mariani said that she
was the only relative of all the passengers that died on Flight 175
that crashed into the South Tower. Her lawyer, Phil Berg, repeated
this statement.

I listened to this show over and over again and couldn't believe what
she had just said. Everything came together at this point. That's when
it dawned on me that not only had our government lied about the
physics of 9-11; they may very well have taken it one step farther by
faking the number of people that died that day. I believed what she
and Mr. Berg had just said. Nothing about 9-11 made any sense. Why
should it start now?

Not knowing then what I know now, Ellen and Phil believed that for
some reason the government was holding back the names of the people
that had died on Flight 175. She had tried to get in touch with the
relatives of other family members, but to no avail. You see, she and
her lawyer believed, just like most other people believe, that four
jets had been hijacked by Arab terrorists and crashed into buildings
and into the ground at Shanksville. I, on the other hand, had already
swept those lies aside.

Their statement also gave credence to the Fox News reporter who said
that the jet which crashed into the South Tower had no windows. Hey,
this jet appeared to have a &quot;pod&quot; under it anyway. The pieces of the
puzzle were starting to fit.

Now, we come to most interesting stuff - the Social Security Death
Index, and thanks to Victor Thorn's idea, the September 11th Victim's
Compensation Fund. After all, it's one thing to say that the flight
lists are not on the up and up, but it's another thing to prove it.

The Social Security Death Index (SSDI) (Social Security Death Index)
is a privately-owned website that is not affiliated with Social
Security. It boasts an accuracy rate of about 83% (e-mail them any
questions you may have). Anyway, to check its reliability, I inputted
the names of people I knew that had died in my family, along with
friends and neighbors. Being a true skeptic, I had no way of knowing
whether they were telling the truth or not. With the exception of a
cousin, I found everyone I was looking for. (Be sure you have the
person's true first name - they may not be listed by the state they
last lived in, but can be found in the state where their social
security number was issued.) By all means try it yourself.

Which brings us to the 9-11 Victims Compensation Fund (also known as
the Shut Up and Take the Money Fund), which most of you have heard
about.

9-11 Victims Compensation Fund

This is where our government opened up the Treasury and gave family
members of those who lost their lives that day lots of money. In
return, these families were basically told to shut up about anything
else concerning 9-11. (Considering all the lies surrounding this
horrific event, you can see why.)

At this point there is one thing we should never forget, and that is
how powerful the notion of human greed is. Remember this concept as
you read the number of victims whose family members sought
compensation.

The names of the victims can be found on the CNN website.

Here are the results:

Flight 11: of the 92 people who are listed as dying on this flight,
only 20 are listed in the SSDI (22%)

Of these 20 people, only three are on the 9-11 Compensation Fund list:

Judy Larocque
Laurie Neira
Candace Lee Williams

=======================================

Flight 77: of the 64 people who are listed as dying on this flight,
only 14 are listed in the SSDI (22%)

Of these 64 people, only five on the 9-11 Compensation Fund list:

William Caswell
Eddie Dillard
Ian Gray
John Sammartino
Leonard Taylor

=======================================

Flight 175: of the 65 people who are listed as dying on this flight,
only 18 are listed in the SSDI (28%)

Of these 65 people, only three are on the 9-11 Compensation Fund list:

Michael C. Tarrou
Gloria Debarrera
Timothy Ward

=======================================

Flight 93: of the 45 people who are listed as dying on this flight,
only 6 are listed in the SSDI (13%)

Of these 45 people, none are on the 9-11 Compensation Fund list:

No one

=======================================

Have you noticed anything strange yet? Of the passengers and crew of
Flight 11, 77, 175 &amp; 93, only 22%, 22%, 28%, 13% respectively are in
the SSDI.

Remember human greed? Of the 266 people that we were told died on
these jets, only 11 relatives applied for compensation. Can you
believe that not a single relative from Flight 93 applied for
compensation? I can't. Were all the relatives of the victims so rich
that they weren't eligible to receive compensation? No, that's not it.
(The minimum federal award was $250,000, and the average pay-out was
about $1.8 million. The recipients only had to make agreement: they
couldn't sue the airlines.)

You should also know that most lawyers told their clients to take the
money and run (which is what most lawyers would do - take the sure
money). Ellen Mariani clearly elaborated on this point during her
appearance on the radio show mentioned above.

Finally, during the past week, thanks to Lisa Guliani's insatiable
quest for the truth, the 9-11 Victims Compensation Final Report has
come to light.

9-11 Victims Compensation Final Report

Oddly, but consistent with everything concerning 9-11, the actual
complete list of the people who benefited has been omitted from this
report. Even without this, it does contain an interesting fact.
According to the report, 98% of all the people who suffered a loss on
9-11 took the fund money. The average payment was $1.8 million.

But here's where it gets strange. According to the government, here
are the number of people who accepted the compensation fund:

Out of a total of 92 people on Flight 11, only 65 accepted the 9-11
fund (71%)
Out of a total of 65 people on Flight 175, only 46 accepted the 9-11
fund (71%)
Out of a total of 64 people on Flight 77, only 33 accepted the 9-11
fund (52%)
Out of a total of 45 people on Flight 93, only 25 accepted the 9-11
fund (56%)

Does any of this seem a little odd to you? Or is it possible that not
only were the jets on 9-11 magical, but their passengers as well?

So there you have it; yet another glaring 9-11 inconsistency - just
maybe the biggest of them all?

I have no formed opinion on 9 11 except scepticism as to the
&quot;official&quot; account, but this is truly bizarre - and from a relative.

Dusty, I generally stay away from discussions around 9/11 except to
the degree they discuss imperialism and how imperialism uses the false
catagory of &quot;terror&quot; to convince people in the US (and a few other
places) that what imperialism is doing is somehow 'saving' Western
civilization and 'democracy'. Those kind of debates I find worth
engaging in. The discussion about the conspiracy is a total
destraction and I find it de-politicizing. The entire miliue, with a
few notable exceptions, abstain from serious politics of any kind. It
makes not a damn bit of difference on politics whether people are
concinced or not the gov't was involved...few care, few are won over,
and those that are generally wish to expose the purpatrators as evil
people; wishing on a start for a 'better, more humane, imperialism'.

Most Americans, for example, don't buy the official story on Kennedy's
murder yet belief in this never mobilized a single person in the class
struggle. Thanks for asking Dusty but I'm just not interested.

Subject: Are the (UK) StWC and others against or (unwittingly)
supporting fascism?

http://www.stopwar.org.uk/

Dear Stop the War Coalition,

Some reasonable questions here:

I wonder why there's no mention on the StWC website front page about
Iran?
I wonder why there's no mention of 9-11, of where the 'war on terror'
began?
I wonder, I wonder why, because
&quot;If we fail to expose the Lie, we become part of the Lie.&quot;

Please read the following carefully.

=================

[EXCERPT]

Numerous prominent gatekeepers have recently said that 9/11 truth is a
&quot;distraction&quot;, and &quot;takes energy away from working on more important
issues&quot;. Are they right?

Actually, 9/11 is the core issue, the central knot which holds all of
the other tyrannical actions of the last 6 years together. When the
central knot of 9/11 lies is pulled, it will cause the entire fascist
mess to unravel.

Here's why:

· The administration's false claims linking Iraq and 9/11 helped
convince a large portion of the American public to invade Iraq. At the
time, the Iraq-911 link was at least as important in many people's
minds as the fake WMDs as a reason to invade Iraq.

· The trauma of September 11, 2001 is what galvanized many Americans
to rally around the Bush administration, to close ranks in a time of
peril, and to give the commander in chief his supposed
&quot;mandate&quot; (there was obviously election fraud).

Ever since 9/11, the American people have been terrified -- and thus
irrational -- based upon the trauma of the vicious attacks. Since most
Americans believe that the bad guys are &quot;out there&quot; and are about to
get us unless we have a strong leader to fight them, they will not and
CANNOT make any logical decisions about any other foreign or domestic
issues -- including withdrawal from Iraq -- until &quot;we get the bad
guys&quot;. Numerous scientific studies show that people whipped into a
state of fear can't make logical decisions. Unless we unwind the
source of their fear -- the false belief that a guy living in a cave
defeated all of America's defenses and that he's out to get us again
-- people will keep on acting irrationally.

· The government policy of torture would not have been tolerated if we
weren't misled into thinking that Saddam and Al-Qaeda had formed an
unholy, all-powerful alliance on 9/11, and had to be stopped at any
costs.

· The Bush administration has also used 9/11 as an excuse for domestic
spying without warrant, and will use 9/11 as an excuse for every other
unconstitutional, undemocratic, unAmerican destruction of civil
liberties which it undertakes.

· Even after all of the government's lies have come out, Americans are
still terrified about Arabs with weapons. Moreover, since Americans
are still largely ignorant about the use of &quot;false flag operations&quot; by
governments to justify wars, Americans will fall for a faked
provocation. In other words, the fact that 9/11 has not been exposed
as a false flag operation will enable the neoconservatives to use
another faked terror incident in order to justify a war against Iran.

9/11 truth has the power to unravel fascism. By proving that our
country cannot so easily be attacked without the complicity of
insiders, 9/11 truth will pull the rug out from beneath the fear-based
hysteria which has gripped our country and our world. As the fear
decreases, people will start to emerge from their mental bunkers, and
to reassess whether they are willing to tolerate fascism, injustice,
and imperial wars based upon false pretenses.

Rather than being a distraction, 9/11 truth is thus crucial for anyone
who cares about America, liberty, justice or peace.

&quot;We know that it is strictly impossible for any building, much less
steel columned buildings, to &quot;pancake&quot; at free fall speed.
Therefore, it is a non-controversial fact that the official
explanation of the collapse of the WTC buildings is false.&quot;

[Excerpt]

The German people were whipped up into a state of hysteria and fear,
because they thought they were under attack by communists, and Poles,
and &quot;bad guys&quot; in general. The German's were in shock, and rallied
around their &quot;strong&quot; leader. Without first exposing that the
Reichstag fire and Operation Himmler - the two things which were the
source and root cause of the German people's fears, and which allowed
the German parliament and other institutions to hand Hitler total
power -- the sweeping away of worthy causes by the wave of fear could
not be stopped.

Americans are crazed by the fear of Arab terrorists just like Germans
were terrified of communist and Polish terrorists. Both peoples have
handed over all of their power to their leaders in order to buy an
imaginary security.

The Nazis might have been brought to justice well before the Nuremberg
trials if the Reichstag hoax had been exposed at the time. The German
people might have snapped out of their false-flag-induced state of
hysteria which prevented them from thinking clearly. They could have
been spared the horrors inflicted on their nation and the world by the
Nazis. And sanity could have been preserved in 1930's-era Germany.

Would that have been a mere &quot;distraction&quot; for the Germans? Is it today
for the people of America? The answer is clearly no.

&gt; I wonder why there's no mention of 9-11, of where the 'war on terror'
&gt; began?
&gt; I wonder, I wonder why, because
&gt; &quot;If we fail to expose the Lie, we become part of the Lie.&quot;

&gt; Please read the following carefully.

&gt; =================

&gt; [EXCERPT]

&gt; Numerous prominent gatekeepers have recently said that 9/11 truth is a
&gt; &quot;distraction&quot;, and &quot;takes energy away from working on more important
&gt; issues&quot;. Are they right?

&gt; Actually, 9/11 is the core issue, the central knot which holds all of
&gt; the other tyrannical actions of the last 6 years together. When the
&gt; central knot of 9/11 lies is pulled, it will cause the entire fascist
&gt; mess to unravel.

&gt; Here's why:

&gt; · The administration's false claims linking Iraq and 9/11 helped
&gt; convince a large portion of the American public to invade Iraq. At the
&gt; time, the Iraq-911 link was at least as important in many people's
&gt; minds as the fake WMDs as a reason to invade Iraq.

&gt; · The trauma of September 11, 2001 is what galvanized many Americans
&gt; to rally around the Bush administration, to close ranks in a time of
&gt; peril, and to give the commander in chief his supposed
&gt; &quot;mandate&quot; (there was obviously election fraud).

&gt; Ever since 9/11, the American people have been terrified -- and thus
&gt; irrational -- based upon the trauma of the vicious attacks. Since most
&gt; Americans believe that the bad guys are &quot;out there&quot; and are about to
&gt; get us unless we have a strong leader to fight them, they will not and
&gt; CANNOT make any logical decisions about any other foreign or domestic
&gt; issues -- including withdrawal from Iraq -- until &quot;we get the bad
&gt; guys&quot;. Numerous scientific studies show that people whipped into a
&gt; state of fear can't make logical decisions. Unless we unwind the
&gt; source of their fear -- the false belief that a guy living in a cave
&gt; defeated all of America's defenses and that he's out to get us again
&gt; -- people will keep on acting irrationally.

&gt; · The government policy of torture would not have been tolerated if we
&gt; weren't misled into thinking that Saddam and Al-Qaeda had formed an
&gt; unholy, all-powerful alliance on 9/11, and had to be stopped at any
&gt; costs.

&gt; · The Bush administration has also used 9/11 as an excuse for domestic
&gt; spying without warrant, and will use 9/11 as an excuse for every other
&gt; unconstitutional, undemocratic, unAmerican destruction of civil
&gt; liberties which it undertakes.

&gt; · Even after all of the government's lies have come out, Americans are
&gt; still terrified about Arabs with weapons. Moreover, since Americans
&gt; are still largely ignorant about the use of &quot;false flag operations&quot; by
&gt; governments to justify wars, Americans will fall for a faked
&gt; provocation. In other words, the fact that 9/11 has not been exposed
&gt; as a false flag operation will enable the neoconservatives to use
&gt; another faked terror incident in order to justify a war against Iran.

&gt; 9/11 truth has the power to unravel fascism. By proving that our
&gt; country cannot so easily be attacked without the complicity of
&gt; insiders, 9/11 truth will pull the rug out from beneath the fear-based
&gt; hysteria which has gripped our country and our world. As the fear
&gt; decreases, people will start to emerge from their mental bunkers, and
&gt; to reassess whether they are willing to tolerate fascism, injustice,
&gt; and imperial wars based upon false pretenses.

&gt; Rather than being a distraction, 9/11 truth is thus crucial for anyone
&gt; who cares about America, liberty, justice or peace.

&gt; &quot;We know that it is strictly impossible for any building, much less
&gt; steel columned buildings, to &quot;pancake&quot; at free fall speed.
&gt; Therefore, it is a non-controversial fact that the official
&gt; explanation of the collapse of the WTC buildings is false.&quot;

&gt; Assistant Secretary U.S. Treasury under President Reagan

&gt; ============== http://911blogger.com/node/12046

&gt; [Excerpt]

&gt; The German people were whipped up into a state of hysteria and fear,
&gt; because they thought they were under attack by communists, and Poles,
&gt; and &quot;bad guys&quot; in general. The German's were in shock, and rallied
&gt; around their &quot;strong&quot; leader. Without first exposing that the
&gt; Reichstag fire and Operation Himmler - the two things which were the
&gt; source and root cause of the German people's fears, and which allowed
&gt; the German parliament and other institutions to hand Hitler total
&gt; power -- the sweeping away of worthy causes by the wave of fear could
&gt; not be stopped.

&gt; Americans are crazed by the fear of Arab terrorists just like Germans
&gt; were terrified of communist and Polish terrorists. Both peoples have
&gt; handed over all of their power to their leaders in order to buy an
&gt; imaginary security.

&gt; The Nazis might have been brought to justice well before the Nuremberg
&gt; trials if the Reichstag hoax had been exposed at the time. The German
&gt; people might have snapped out of their false-flag-induced state of
&gt; hysteria which prevented them from thinking clearly. They could have
&gt; been spared the horrors inflicted on their nation and the world by the
&gt; Nazis. And sanity could have been preserved in 1930's-era Germany.

&gt; Would that have been a mere &quot;distraction&quot; for the Germans? Is it today
&gt; for the people of America? The answer is clearly no.
">

Ah...now they say it's the &quot;Core issue&quot;. Very good. I hate to agent
bait these assholes, but clearly they want the anti-war movement to go
away, since its a distraction to their conspiracy theories. The
Reichstag mention has to be the grossest a-historical comment I've
ever since. Of course, Vngelis posted it, so it's consistent with
everything else he has posted.

David,
How you can seriously argue that the exposure of the lying official
9/11 account isn't a central anti-war question is beyond me.

Every time governments (take the Australian government as an example)
justify their &quot;commitment&quot; to the Iraq war (and more) 9/11 lurks as
justification not far in the background.

And I cannot understand your spleen towards these people - the worst
of whom might be called conspiracy cranks, but the mainstream perform
a very valuable service in exposing the official bases behind these
and future globalist wars. And the good thing is that, with the
internet, we now have a free exchange and currency of all ideas on
this question. This and street demonstrations and so on are by no
means mutually exclusive nor even competitive, but complementary.

Perhaps I overstate my case, Dusty, but it's not &quot;Central&quot; since what
is central is the occupation itself, 9/11 has been exposed as a fraud
vis-a-vis Iraq quite a long time ago and no one seriously places it
anymore (by the imperialists and their spokespersons) as an argument
for Iraq, regardless of who believes it was a conspiracy by the CIA
and Mossad or Al Quida. It makes *no difference*.

I'm not talking about the cranks, I understand the role they play. I'm
talking about, dear I say it &quot;the mainstream 9/11&quot; movement which
actually has a depoliticizing effect on activists. Living in the heart
of the 9/11 movement (SF-Bay area) I've never seen anyone drop their
*support* for the war because of &quot;revelations&quot;  about 9/11. Not one.
What changes people about the war varies, to be honest, but it comes
to the rights and wrongs of occupation, financial disruption of the
economy, deaths of GIs, etc etc. That is, what one might see in the
history of opposition to any war...not the subtle machinations of MI5
or CIA. It is interesting, but the people &quot;won over&quot; to this point of
view are already opposed to the war in varying degrees or just don't
care about ending it. Unfortunatly that is the truth of the 9/11 truth
movement.

Does it 'help'? I some ways it does, and, sure, anything that casts
doubt on the official line on 9/11 can't hurt, I suppose. But it's a
tertiary movement at best, and simply put, doesn't nothing to help end
the war.

I went the Labor Anti-War conference sponsored by Local 10 of the ILWU
yesterday, where there was real discussion about popularizing labor
strikes against the war, mobilizing labor at the point of production,
etc. Ralph Schoneman briefly intervened on this aspect of the war in
Iraq (and he and Mya Shone did a great analysis of Zionism in the
Middle-East work shop where we discussed bringing anti-Zionism into
the labor movement) but it had no real impact on what we were
discussing.

I'm not sure why is more misguided, the truthers' insanity or your
view, which I take to be that _even if_ the truthers were accurate in
their claims of fact (but then, _which_ truthers), the issue would be
irrelevant. Were I convinced or even if I seriously suspected that
that Bush was the one who did in the WTC, I would favor the most
energetic and extensive exposure imaginable.This would be an exposure
of such magnitude that it could well by itself produce a revolutionary
crisis. That Bush engineered such a monstrous lie and the entire
political establishment covered it up (what with the possible unlikely
exception, Congressman Ron Paul) would produce a climate comparable to
that in Eastern Europe, where the entire bourgeoisie collaborated with
Germany. Or Cuba, when Castro took power, for that matter. I guess I
would have to say that where your grasp of reality is superior to
vngelis's, his political instincts are the more acute.

As you say, 'truth&quot; has not built any political movement or triggered
one, but that is not because their charges are inconsequential . It is
rather that many who seem to support the position amongst the
multitude do so only in an emblematic fashion, without seriously
giving the charges credence. Or perhaps the better, more Marxist and
precise way of putting it is that those who follow this movement are
the politically and socially powerless, whose opinions don't matter.
Which is to say it is a thoroughly petty bourgeois/marginal bourgeois
movement.

Between your position and vngelis's, the latter's is surely the
crazier but yours probably the more dangerous. In essence, you
repudiate the essentials of even early Leninism, in the doctrine that
the whole realm of politics is the proletariat's business, and the
class must take a stand on all questions. You err both in thinking
that 9/11, if the truthers had a serious argument, is not political
AND in thinking that only political questions matter. Lenin demolished
each of these views, of course, in _What is to be Done?_

This all seems to derive from your continued partial commitment to the
SWP/YSA of the Vietnam era. This much is clear because you reason that
9/11 is irrelevant because no one ties it directly to the war in Iraq.
You apparently think a mass anti-Iraq war movement of the anti-Vietnam
war sort will or should be created, a single-issue movement concerned
with nothing except that war.That's your quite express reasoning. But
Iraq is not a critical domino like Vietnam was conceived by the
bourgeoisie to be, but rather only one in what will be a long string
of imperialist small-scale interventions. It is not killing masses of
people at present, but only for the most part demoralized and
reactionary elements who choose to go into the army. If &quot;Bring the
Troops Home Now&quot; pandered to chauvinism, as it did, then applying such
a slogan to Iraq can only be termed outright chauvinist. A movement
against the Iraq war cannot in principle be based on any sympathy with
the troops, and if it pushes the economy into a meltdown, that result
should be welcomed.

Your politics themselves keep you from the correct position on 9/11,
which is part of why you think the issue irrelevant. But the truthers
are a reactionary movement, not only because of the inherent
chauvinism or pandering to the same that you share with them.They are
a reactionary movement because they represent a world view in which
only the high priests of &quot;truth&quot; can interpret reality.

In some ways the mentality of this cult resembles the Healyites, which
I probably emphasize only because of my familiarity with that
mentality. Wohlforth would relate the line that the crisis was
deepening so rapidly that we were in a pre-revolutionary situation. As
&quot;proof&quot; a string of strikes would be cited. Any one who disagreed
suffered from a deep-seated inability to see the class struggle, a
constitutional conservatism of character. There could be no proof in
the usual sense, as that smacked of &quot;formal logic&quot; and an
undialectical cast of mind. Similarly the truthers--but in their case,
addressing the masses rather than some 100 cadres--say that those who
deny their story are prevented from seeing &quot;truth&quot; by their basic
allegiance to Bush and an inability to grasp the obvious facts or to
question authority. In agitating for a 1984-like version of reality,
they set themselves up as the ultimate arbiters of what is real. They
disseminate a world view which rather than _avoiding_ politics as you
say, actually makes real political discussion impossible. If 1984 were
a historical possibility, the truthers would be it main proponents.

No, the working class cannot ignore the &quot;truth&quot; movement. It must
obliterate it.

Let me say--lest Dusty or someone lecture me--that when I say it the
Iraq war isn't killing a lot of people, I am referring to U.S.
soldiers. Iraqis indeed are being slaughtered. But only an impotent,
moralistic movement can be constructed based on sympathies with the
Iraqi plight, except in the context of an more embracing anti-
imperialism.

The only &quot;mass movement&quot; is one that moves people at the level of
their political consciousness, class interests (meaning they know
exactly where they stand), etc. You've long rejected the Transitional
Program, because of you sectarian for mass movement and mobilizing
people at *their* political level. I still adhere to it.

I say &quot;even if the truthers have SOME basis in...facts&quot; until that
level of their 'truth' can convince most Americans about 9/11, I don't
give a shit about them. I defend their right to express their views in
the anti-war movement if they *support* the anti-war movement, which
most do not, they abstain from it or intervene in it, but rarely, to
my knowledge, go beyond that. I've mentioned several exceptions and
defend their right to express their views &quot;from the podium&quot; so to
speak. But you are correct...they simply will not convince most people
about 9/11 and these sorts of views...totally at opposite to the kind
of method you invoke with Lenin...are, *in fact* a detraction to even
raising consciousness above that of simple pacifism or pro-peace POVs.

SRD...most Americans, or a large minority (I read 45% about 10 years
ago once so the number stuck with me) believe Oswald was not alone,
that the gov't/CIA/somebody was in on it. Wow! And...big fucking
deal.

&gt; &gt; reactionary elements who choose to go into the army. If &quot;Bring the
&gt; &gt; Troops Home Now&quot; pandered to chauvinism, as it did, then applying such
&gt; &gt; a slogan to Iraq can only be termed outright chauvinist. A movement
&gt; &gt; against the Iraq war cannot in principle be based on any sympathy with
&gt; &gt; the troops, and if it pushes the economy into a meltdown, that result
&gt; &gt; should be welcomed.

&gt; &gt; Your politics themselves keep you from the correct position on 9/11,
&gt; &gt; which is part of why you think the issue irrelevant. But the truthers
&gt; &gt; are a reactionary movement, not only because of the inherent
&gt; &gt; chauvinism or pandering to the same that you share with them.They are
&gt; &gt; a reactionary movement because they represent a world view in which
&gt; &gt; only the high priests of &quot;truth&quot; can interpret reality.

&gt; &gt; In some ways the mentality of this cult resembles the Healyites, which
&gt; &gt; I probably emphasize only because of my familiarity with that
&gt; &gt; mentality. Wohlforth would relate the line that the crisis was
&gt; &gt; deepening so rapidly that we were in a pre-revolutionary situation. As
&gt; &gt; &quot;proof&quot; a string of strikes would be cited. Any one who disagreed
&gt; &gt; suffered from a deep-seated inability to see the class struggle, a
&gt; &gt; constitutional conservatism of character. There could be no proof in
&gt; &gt; the usual sense, as that smacked of &quot;formal logic&quot; and an
&gt; &gt; undialectical cast of mind. Similarly the truthers--but in their case,
&gt; &gt; addressing the masses rather than some 100 cadres--say that those who
&gt; &gt; deny their story are prevented from seeing &quot;truth&quot; by their basic
&gt; &gt; allegiance to Bush and an inability to grasp the obvious facts or to
&gt; &gt; question authority. In agitating for a 1984-like version of reality,
&gt; &gt; they set themselves up as the ultimate arbiters of what is real. They
&gt; &gt; disseminate a world view which rather than _avoiding_ politics as you
&gt; &gt; say, actually makes real political discussion impossible. If 1984 were
&gt; &gt; a historical possibility, the truthers would be it main proponents.

&gt; &gt; No, the working class cannot ignore the &quot;truth&quot; movement. It must
&gt; &gt; obliterate it.

&gt; &gt; srd

&gt; The only &quot;mass movement&quot; is one that moves people at the level of
&gt; their political consciousness, class interests (meaning they know
&gt; exactly where they stand), etc. You've long rejected the Transitional
&gt; Program, because of you sectarian for mass movement and mobilizing
&gt; people at *their* political level. I still adhere to it.

&gt; I say &quot;even if the truthers have SOME basis in...facts&quot; until that
&gt; level of their 'truth' can convince most Americans about 9/11, I don't
&gt; give a shit about them. I defend their right to express their views in
&gt; the anti-war movement if they *support* the anti-war movement, which
&gt; most do not, they abstain from it or intervene in it, but rarely, to
&gt; my knowledge, go beyond that. I've mentioned several exceptions and
&gt; defend their right to express their views &quot;from the podium&quot; so to
&gt; speak. But you are correct...they simply will not convince most people
&gt; about 9/11 and these sorts of views...totally at opposite to the kind
&gt; of method you invoke with Lenin...are, *in fact* a detraction to even
&gt; raising consciousness above that of simple pacifism or pro-peace POVs.

&gt; SRD...most Americans, or a large minority (I read 45% about 10 years
&gt; ago once so the number stuck with me) believe Oswald was not alone,
&gt; that the gov't/CIA/somebody was in on it. Wow! And...big fucking
&gt; deal.

Most of the anti-war movement and opposition to it was middle  class
in the imperialist West.
There is no reason to hold that against the truth movement for that
would imply the same reason against the anti-war movement. Most of the
people I have met were radicalised by the anti-war movement. Some are
from the old left. Some are right-wingers. Its contradictory much like
the anti-globalisation movement. Abstention though isn't a policy, its
an excuse.

With a few notable exceptions the working class hasn't been involved
for a variety of reasons.
As such the concepts of Blair lied about WMD, the death of Dr. Kelly
and the 9/11 attacks have come under particular scrutiny. The level of
debate in some of the 9/11 sites is quite big and as with the anti-
globalisation movement when 'left' groups refused to take part as they
weren't crystal clear, the same rules apply now. The organised forces
of the left refuse to take part and will do so when critical mass
appears only in order to push forward a line in dissolving it like
they did with the anti-globalisation movement after the adopted en
masse the line we need more immigrants in each country not less.

The implications as noted by SRD will be akin to a tsunami for the
political world. But it isn't something most people dont know already.
In the last two years, Chavez, Castro, Ahmedinajad etc have come on
board on 9/11. More will follow possibly the Chinese. The Russians
cant without themselves being exposed for doing the same thing!

The political world is lagging essentially behind most peoples
perceptions but with time everything changes. Most people are now more
familiar with the arguments that mass immigration aim to lower the
standard of living and benefits big business and politicians than
anyone. Looking at the comments posted in the Telegraph shows this.

David says the 9/11 movement doesn't tackle imperialism or raise
consciousness but lower it.
He argues for a US imposed new world order through the mechanism of
mass immigration.
How does he raise consciousness when people cant even speak one
language anymore?

Anti-9/11 diatribes are pro-Bush eulogies, otherwise known as the left

P.S. On the other hand, to describe Telegraph readers as Neanderthal is

Whatever its origins - and they are human - the Telegraph article is
pretty rounded and objective - in marked contrast to the PC blindness
to real issues and downright mendacity one finds in many writings of
those who would have it that they are marxists. So what happens is
that the field is wide open to those who have traditionally supported
the Tories.

A case in point was the kind of drivel written a few years ago by the
&quot;SWP&quot; on immigration. Here it is with comments by Vngelis taken from
the KDE website Globalism vs anti-capitalism:

HOW THE SWP SUPPORTS NEW LABOUR AND IMPERIALIST IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
A Marxist Critique of Home Office 'Socialists'
In a pamphlet entitled &quot;Refugees are Not To Blame&quot; with subtiltes 'No
to Scapegoating and No To Immigration Controls&quot; written by a Hassan
Mahmadallie the SWP declares itself with New Labour's immigration
policies and the NATO programme of counterrevolution in Eastern
Europe. In order to understand the full depth of their policies and
how related they are to the ruling government we will use some
paragraphs from their pamphlet.

&quot;Answering the myths
1. Are we overcrowded?
No. The population of Britain is around 59 million. It is hardly
growing at all. Migration of people out of this country since the
Second World War has consistently been higher than those coming to
settle. For example, 54,000 people permanently left the country in
1995, 10,000 more than claimed asylum. 10,000 more than claimed
asylum. But no one talks of a 'flood' of people leaving Britain.
Since 1971 there has been a sharp fall in the number of births in
Britain. In common with the rest of Western Europe, we have an ageing
population. By 2050 the population of Britain is set to drop to 56
million. This means that in the next century Britain will need to find
new sources of labour to keep up the workforce. Asylum seekers could
provide part of that labour supply&quot;

In order to prove that asylum seekers are welcome here and that their
arrival doesn't actually affect anyone, even the British working
class, one has to create a reality to fit the purpose of the
argument.  All well and good if the argument was actually tailored to
represent the reality of capitalist Britain in decline. But if the
argument is tailored to defend capitalism in decline then reality has
to be inverted. Has the author asked the millions who live in council
flats in overcrowded estates whether Britain is overcrowded? Or are we
dealing with a theoretical concept of overcrowding which takes no
account of present day reality and just argues that another 10 or 20
million people could fit into Britain? Russia which has approximately
260 million people in 1/6 of the worlds earth surface is definitely
underpopulated in relation to its land mass, but that doesn't stop the
government having 20 odd people in a cell where prisoners take it in
turns to lie on the floor spending at least 20 hours a day standing
up. Is this overcrowding? Is this what we mean when we say we aren't
overcrowded? When we wait for buses or go to the dole queue or the
local library are we on are own? Is the UK a country which can easily
cope with an influx of millions as the author of the SWP argues?  When
it is stated more people left England than actually came in are we
supposed to take this literally or assert in relation to the number of
asylum seekers? Are they the only ones coming into the UK? Or are we
playing with words to create a diversion? New York over a twenty five
year period has had at least 2 million new arrivals. Has London had
any less? Only in the decade of the 1990's at least 70, 000 Kurds have
arrived? Were they asylum seekers or not? Irrelevant question.  The
issue are the numbers. Has Britain seen its population decrease over a
twenty five year period or increase. If it has increased then the SWP
is inverting reality to serve its purpose.
As a result of the ageing population which the government always talks
about and wants to raise the age of retirement so you work till you
drop dead, the SWP now argues labour shortages will be created in the
distant future and these labour shortages can be filled by asylum
seekers. Is capitalism actually creating jobs which cannot be filled
in the UK and labour from abroad needs to be brought in? Full
employment is once more on the agenda!!! This obviously happened in
the 1950's during the post-capitalist boom. Are we in the same period?
Has Labour actually ever reversed the 19 or so changes in calculating
the rate of unemployment which the Tories introduced which actually
led to pretending there are no longer any unemployed in the UK? Can
British workers actually find jobs? Aren't there at least 5 million
unemployed? Where will the asulym seekers now find jobs, if they
aren't asked to work on slave labour wages in scab outfits? Or should
they be asked to take over jobs done by British workers at starvation
wages? Here the SWP reveals its class hatred of British workers and
sides with the government which wants to use immigrant labour to
undercut hard won rights, as has happened in sub-contracted council
cleaning companies. A stroll in London will actually show that shops
are now open 24 hours a day and workers in these shops primarily from
the immigrant communities work without any rights whatsoever. That is
why it has appointed Barbara Roche MP as a new Minister for
Immigration to handle the largest influx of immigrants in post-war
Britain. This isn't mentioned in the SWP pamphlet as they are
concerned in telling the British working class it has to move to the
side to allow immigrants in.

2. &quot;Are We Flooded with Asylum Seekers Compared to Other Countries?
NO. There are an estimated 13 million refugees today, fleeing war and
brutal regimes. Britain provides for just 0.5% of them in 1997 In 1997
Germany received the most applications for asylum - 100.000.  Britain
received just 30,000 application. Britain takes less refugees per head
of the population than the following countries: Germany, Switzerland,
the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Denmark
and Canada.&quot;

Its an irony that Greece is actually missed out. It has according to
government statistics accepted 1.5 million in the 1990's alone. That
is equivalent to 35% of the working population. Has Greece been
flooded? Technically no. If you apply the Russian principle of 20 to a
cell and now picture Greece where people sleep 10 to a room it still
has a long way to go. The issue is what is a flood? What percentage
are we dealing with which turns a puddle into a flood? The author of
the SWP doesn't answer this question as again reality needs to be
inverted to fit the argument. We can help him. If we cram 30 to a room
and calculate that there are so many rooms in a country and then we
get to figure out what a possible flood may actually mean. But what
does a flood mean in the labour supply? What does an oversupply of
labour mean? Does it exist or is it a concept which doesn't exist in
the SWP school of defenders of capitalism in decline? Are wages
actually going up which would imply there was an undersupply of labour
or unions were achieving rights or is the opposite occurring?

3. Won't Asylum Seekers Take Our Jobs?
&quot;NO. Asulym seekers are not to blame for unemployment. In the 1930's
there were virtually no asylum seekers allowed into Britain, yet we
had mass unemployment. In the 1950's and 1960's we had immigration
from the Commonwealth and full employment. It is not asylum seekers
who are putting workers in Britain onto the dole. They do no sit on
the boards of companies that are sacking thousands of workers every
week.
Take the case of Dover. It is true there is a lack of jobs. But who is
to blame? For years the Tory council stopped factories being built so
that locals would be forced into low paid work in the tourist
industry.
It was the Tory government which closed down the Kent pits after the
1985 miners strike. And it was the bosses of P&amp;O who sacked 2,000
local seafarers who went on strike to defend their jobs. All this
happened before one refugee set foot in Dover. As Malcolm Pitt, leader
of the Kent miners during the 1985, says &quot;It is total hypocrisy of Ann
Widdecombe and the Tories who created the situation to blame the
victims rather than the perpetrators.
The Thatcher government wanted to destroy jobs and let rip free market
economics that tears peoples lives up everywhere. They smacked workers
in the head and now want to divide and rule. The only answer is for
workers in the head and now want to divide and rule. The only way is
for workers of all races to unite in opposition to the common enemy&quot;.

One would assume the SWP could take into account different historical
periods. One of capitalist boom and one of capitalist decline. Is the
British imperialist state going to make the ruling class pay for the
extra cost in housing and schooling for the refugees or will it make
the working class pay? As for the attacks on the working class in the
18 years of Tory rule it was helped along by the union bureaucracy
which is bound hand and foot to the Labour Party which we must never
forget did everything in its power to undermine the miners strike and
essentially wipe out the mining industry from the UK. The SWP argument
implies the only ones to blame are the Tories as they are to the right
of New Labour and that asserting that the extra burdens which the
state is undertaking is no cost at all, just &quot;a penny on income tax at
today's levels&quot;(p.7) In other words nothing is really happening one
doesn't understand what all the fuss is about and no jobs have been
taken despite asserting East Europeans are working on the farms in
Kent. (&quot;Yet who harvests the fruit and vegetable crops in this &quot;garden
of England&quot; for poverty pay? British seasonal workers and migrant
labour from Eastern Europe.&quot; P.9) The SWP asserts most British people
work in the tourist industry around Dover and the fact that many
hotels are being turned into refugee

If one points to a scale of one to ten and ten being the most
reactionary then the fact that Labour has been in bed with the Texan
oil gangsters for most of the last decade in what way are they less
reactionary than the old Conrad Black Telegraph? Taking into account
the SWP voted for the Labour Party in the last 3 elections you do have

I don't think I currently reject the Transitional Program. In fact,
I've been considering a posting on the Transitional Program in the era
of the Transitional Bourgeoisie, but I'm not yet certain enough the
theory works. That is, the whether the theory I propose works, not the
theory of the Transitional Program. I think it is true that the
Healyites partly rejected the method, but only partly. How else to
explain the centrality they assigned in the United States to forming a
labor party. In that sense, the Sparts were the one to reject the
transitional method, by insisting on a &quot;revolutionary labor party.&quot; Or
even the left-Shachmanites, in calling for a labor party based on the
&quot;rank and file.&quot; Insisting that is on complete rejection of the
bureaucracy as a precondition for the masses acting from where they
stood in consciousness.

In fact their insistence on the labor party slogan--which slogan they
rather confusingly styled a &quot;demand&quot;--showed exactly how they
abandoned the transitional program. The reasoning is interesting and
to me at the time compelling. The premise is that because Marxists
base their program on objective reality, not consciousness, demands of
central objective importance must be raised in every forum. What's
wrong with the argument lies in a confusion between program and the
slogans raised at given time and place. But I'm sure you see this.

However, the need to base agitation on both hard reality and current
consciousness does not mean that agitation sets the limit of political
intervention. The reglect of propaganda in favor of agitation, and
thus limiting the expressed program to primitive demands, is the mark
of Economism, although the term is inapt because the issues you
emphasized are not necessarily economic ones. What's the term for this
disease. The only term I come up with is tail-ending. I think Lenin is
just translated as tailism, which term I prefer.

">

So it gets you to this point, an anti-theoretical stance so vulgar
that to debate it would be a distraction. Illumination follows from
attacking the strongest forms of false positions, not ... this.

Your error is the inverse of the WL While the Healyites said that only
the objective situation should determine agitation, you say the party
should not care to state the objective truth unless it is
agitationally significant. When Trotsky recommended the labor party
demand, despite or at least granting arguendo its limited popularity
with the workers, he was speaking to program. As was Lenin, when he
advocated propaganda directed to the most advanced workers--
essentially meaning propaganda as a tool for recruitment to the party--
he was speaking to program.
