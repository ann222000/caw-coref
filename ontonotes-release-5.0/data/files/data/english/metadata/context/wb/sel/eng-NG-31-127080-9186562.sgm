I have gout. It's a low sat.fat/low protein/high complex carb diet.

Now with diabetes, which seems to be low carb, what am I gonna do?

Any gout and diabetics in the house? How do you manage your diet?

Some people have to walk a line between different conditions &amp; what they
need, find a balance, split the difference, etc. Diabetes &amp; gout is one of
them. Will is working on that right now. He will be around sooner or later,
I'm sure. Others may, too.

about your diagnosis?

I see the Doc when my reader arrives so he can show me how to use it,
discuss altering my diet, etc.

I don't know which type I have. Doc just mentioned 120. To be perfectly
honest I don't feel different than years gone by.

I've been a fairly heavy drinker when it comes to drinking. Football,

Just FYI, it's pretty easy to figure out how to do your glucometer. I didn't
have any doctor's instructions on it at all, although I did get mine free

No but I'll bet that's why my reading is so high.

What does gout think about the booze?

And, is there anything preventing gout sufferers from eating lots of
veggies?

I had it badly about 7 years ago just after diagnosis. The gout diet didn't
work at all, so I went back to low carbing. Turns out I was put on a
diuretic to control BP and that was the problem. May not be the case for
everyone. My uric acid levels still remain just out of normal range but I
get no gout symptoms anymore.

First rule of gout is no alcohol!

Second rule of gout is lots of veggies. All colors. Veggies ARE great but
chewing so many bell peppers to meet my caloric intake hurts my jaw after
awhile. ;) My favorite dish is a &quot;vegelaya&quot; of my own design but it's served
with brown rice (complex carb). I can probably drop the brown rice and fall
behind on my daily caloric intake. Something I pay careful attention to.

There are a few more rules I won't bore you with.

In the beginning I was aiming for 60g carb/day and taking a diuretic and a
statin. Whether or not all of that played a role, I can't say.

I had gout episodes in first one foot and then the other. My approach was to
modify my diet to eliminate the worst purine containing foods, add/increase
foods with anti-inflammatory effect, drop the diuretic, hydrate more, add
black cherry juice concentrate to my morning cottage cheese and was
prescribed Allopurinol.

I've since also dropped the statin and am taking Niacin and Pentathine
instead and gradually raised my carb target to around 120g/day.

Something in all that worked since I dropped the Allopurinal this spring
(with my doctor's concurrence). Haven't had an episode since the original
ones. I hope to *never* experience gout again!!

Good Luck!

I was prescribed allopurinol and indocin. I never used the allopurinol,
opting to cut out most of the bad foods in my diet instead. Which has
worked. And I haven't needed an indocin in a few weeks.

Now I have to try to re-balance my diet which seems directly opposite of
each other.

I'll wait and discuss it with the Doc in detail.

Actually, it's not so much that you have to eat complex
carbs as that you need to restrict certain foods which gives
you more limited choices. Within those choices it should
still be possible to find acceptable menus that will neither
exacerbate the gout nor the diabetes.

Not easy, but possible with some compromising.

I was diagnosed with gout when I was 27, but I probably had it when I
was 21 since an x-ray showed a spur on my left big toe at that time.
The American Diatetic Association recommended a low purine diet because
uric acid is the result of incomplete metabolism of purines.  I probably
ate no more than a pound of meat the year after diagnosis, but I missed
it. I have used 300 mg/day of allopurinol in the morning for over 44
years. Allopurinol is also an anti-oxidant so it is not a bad med for
diabetics.  I hardly ever test for uric acid since it is always in the
normal range, i.e. &lt;7.

My diet is based on having blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure
control.  I meet better than the minimum goals on all 3 areas which is
less than 7% for all diabetics in the U.S.

Hi Andy,

I am so very sorry to hear about your travails with gout. Most who
read here regularly know that I suffered with it for about 2 months
recently, during which I missed about 3 weeks of work, and was laid up
for days on end....

My basic rule of survival as to gout, as it has evolved, has been to
practice moderation... Yes, I avoid sat fat foods as much as possible,
eat lots of beans and greens, still have moderate protein foods, and
still have moderate amounts of alcohol. The key is moderation and
common sense.

They say alcohol does not per se cause gout, but I have found that it
can and does tend to exacerbate the condition, once it is underway in
your system.

A big help for me  ( for short term crisis management only) was the
drug colchicine... As a daily med, allopurinol has proven to work
wonders! Also, just remember to get plenty of water...

Good luck in coping with the horribly painful affliction of gout.

I've had gout for 7 years now, and probably diabetes as well but only known
about it for a few months.

I take alopurinol every day and haven't had any symptoms for months, since
going on low carb/fat/booze etc. diet.

Drink HEAPS of water, the only way to rid yourself or uric acid.

Cheers - Mike

Pop had gout but he took cholocine and it either went away or settled down
and he didn't mention it ever again. He did have to switch over to weight
watchers when we were in our infancy. And Mom being a gourmet cook, we
suffered with him as far as she gave up gourmet cooking as a result. The
squished yarlsberg cheese toasted English muffin, day after day, with
powdered milk, not again in my lifetime, if I can help it :P

Pop-Pop had diabetes so I figured if it skips a generation, it's only a

&gt; for days on end....

&gt; My basic rule of survival as to gout, as it has evolved, has been to
&gt; practice moderation... Yes, I avoid sat fat foods as much as possible,
&gt; eat lots of beans and greens, still have moderate protein foods, and
&gt; still have moderate amounts of alcohol. The key is moderation and
&gt; common sense.

&gt; They say alcohol does not per se cause gout, but I have found that it
&gt; can and does tend to exacerbate the condition, once it is underway in
&gt; your system.

&gt; A big help for me  ( for short term crisis management only) was the
&gt; drug colchicine... As a daily med, allopurinol has proven to work
&gt; wonders! Also, just remember to get plenty of water...

&gt; Good luck in coping with the horribly painful affliction of gout.

Will,

Beans are gout poison for me!

Doc gave me a list of purine foods charted as avoid, seldom, etc. and I
just about cried. But managed to adjust and didn't take the allopurinol
since most of my favorite foods were fatty and high-protein. Keeping those
foods out of my diet helped me lose 30 pounds since the end of May.

I keep indocin around when I know I'm going to eat gout poison and now it's
down to a minor aggravation if at all.

I've always drank a ton of water which caused someone to ask me if I was
diabetic but I didn't make the connection.

Best,

Andy

&gt;&gt; Gout seems to be genetic in my family. I know of three including myself.
&gt;&gt;   It is also a disease that effects men more than women.

&gt;&gt; Frank

&gt; Pop had gout but he took cholocine and it either went away or settled down
&gt; and he didn't mention it ever again. He did have to switch over to weight
&gt; watchers when we were in our infancy. And Mom being a gourmet cook, we
&gt; suffered with him as far as she gave up gourmet cooking as a result. The
&gt; squished yarlsberg cheese toasted English muffin, day after day, with
&gt; powdered milk, not again in my lifetime, if I can help it :P

That sounds more like a switch for economic reasons rather than gout.
Backin the day kids were often not told about the family's finances, and if
it's back a goodly way it could have been depression years?

Yeah.. I have a jar of that stuff... I really hate to have to resort
to it, but sometimes it helps.
