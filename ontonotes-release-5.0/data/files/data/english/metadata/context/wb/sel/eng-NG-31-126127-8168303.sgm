Vintage AC/DC, Nirvana Still Big-Sellers
By JAKE COYLE
AP Entertainment Writer

July 16, 2007

Much of the rock 'n' roll and pop canon is well established.

Buying the albums of `60s and `70s acts like the Beatles, the Beach
Boys, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley is akin to a rite of
passage for any young music fan. These are the artists that baby
boomers love to keep buying, and with whom seemingly every teenager
at some point experiments. (Remember A.J. hearing Bob Dylan for the
first time in the &quot;Sopranos&quot; finale?)

Now that the `80s and `90s are ancient history, what albums are
people still buying from those decades? Do critical favorites like
Radiohead and the Pixies grow more popular with time? Or do the
Backstreet Boys and Madonna still rule the charts?

The short answer is that, above all, people are buying vintage
Metallica, AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Guns 'N Roses and, well, Trans-Siberian
Orchestra.

AC/DC's &quot;Back in Black&quot; (1980) last year sold 440,000 copies and has
thus far sold 156,000 this year, according to the Nielsen SoundScan
catalog charts, which measure how well physical albums older than
two years old are selling. (All figures for this article were
provided by Nielsen SoundScan.)

Those &quot;Back in Black&quot; numbers would make most contemporary CDs a
success. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album is altogether the
second-biggest selling album of the Nielsen SoundScan era, which
began in 1991. &quot;Metallica&quot; sold 275,000 copies last year.

Bon Jovi's greatest hits collection &quot;Cross Road&quot; last year sold
324,000 copies, while Guns 'N Roses &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;
(1987) sold 113,000. The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's &quot;Christmas Eve
and Other Stories&quot; (1996) continues to be a holiday favorite; it was
bought 289,000 times last year.

Greatest hits compilations are counted as catalog releases, and
account for the majority of vintage best-sellers. Artists that
commercially peaked in the `80s or `90s that have had lucrative
best-of collections include Garth Brooks, the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
Tim McGraw, Creed, Queen, Tom Petty, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Def
Leppard, Aerosmith and Lionel Richie.

U2, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, Celine Dion, Eric Clapton, Elton
John, Dave Matthews Band and the ever-touring Jimmy Buffett also all
continue to sell large amounts of old records.

Michael Jackson, of course, still has one of the most desirable back
catalogs. His best- selling &quot;Thriller&quot; moves over 60,000 copies a
year and his &quot;Number Ones&quot; collection yielded 162,000 sales last year.

Avid fans may be buying everything their favorite artist puts out,
but there's more than nostalgia fueling vintage sales.

&quot;Young fans aren't excluded from catalog sales - especially the ones
who really get interested in music, there's always that sense of
discovery,&quot; says Geoff Mayfield, the director of charts at Billboard
Magazine.

Not everything maintains long-term success. Asia's self-titled 1982
album was the biggest seller of 1982, but only sold 5,000 copies
last year. Whitney Houston's 1985 debut, also self-titled, was
1986's top album, but now sells about 7,000 discs a year.

The same trajectory has befallen past mega-hits like Ace of Base's
&quot;The Sign,&quot; Bobby Brown's &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and the Spice Girl's
&quot;Spice.&quot; Though one of the best selling artists of all time, Mariah
Carey's self-titled debut sold a measly 5,000 copies last year. The
Backstreet Boys' &quot;Millennium&quot; managed only 9,000 sales.

Alas, the turning wheel of fortune isn't always kind to boy bands.

&quot;The only thing that kept coming to mind to me was that line in the
Bruce Springsteen song: `Someday we'll look back at this and it will
all seem funny,'&quot; recalls Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke.

Now, some critical hits that were trounced on their initial release
by the likes of 'N Sync can claim a measure of commercial
superiority. The Flaming Lips' &quot;Soft Bulletin,&quot; often hailed as one
of the best albums of the `90s by critics, sold a solid 38,000
copies last year.

Radiohead's legendary &quot;OK Computer,&quot; currently celebrating its
10-year anniversary, last year sold 94,000 copies. Nirvana's
&quot;Nevermind&quot; has done even better; it sold 143,000 copies in 2006.

Current events can alter the charts. When Ray Charles died, his
older albums spiked for months, says Mayfield. A new album from
Alanis Morissette would surely increase sales of her 1995 disc
&quot;Jagged Little Pill,&quot; one of the best selling albums of the past 20
years.

Likewise, recent reunions of the Police and Genesis can be expected
to increase sales of their catalogs. The Police's 1986 compilation
&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; has already doubled its already strong 2006
sales by selling 107,000 copies so far this year.

Many well-regarded albums continue to do healthy business,
including: U2's &quot;Joshua Tree,&quot; Dr. Dre's &quot;The Chronic,&quot; Beck's
&quot;Odelay,&quot; Wu-Tang Clan's &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang,&quot; the Clash's &quot;London
Calling,&quot; Weezer's &quot;Weezer,&quot; and the Pixies' &quot;Doolittle.&quot; Each sold
at least 20,000 copies last year.

Still, many albums that are consistently revered on critic top-ten
lists of the `80s and `90s have not sold much. Joy Division's
&quot;Closer,&quot; the Smiths' &quot;The Queen is Dead,&quot; My Bloody Valentine's
&quot;Loveless,&quot; and REM's &quot;Murmur&quot; all sold 12,000 copies or less last year.

Labels often reissue classic releases to capitalize on the devotion
of die-hard fans and to attract a new audience. In the past few
years, revered indie label Matador Records has released Pavement's
first three albums, including &quot;Slanted and Enchanted,&quot; a disc
frequently ranked among the best in the `90s.

&quot;It's almost like a new release for us,&quot; says Matador founder Chris
Lombardi. &quot;We probably sold in a one-year period, pretty much what
those records sold in their first year period when they were
initially released.&quot;

Though hip-hop continues to rule today's charts, many of its most
historic albums don't enjoy the catalog sales that those from rock's
heyday do. Public Enemy's &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us
Back&quot; sold 15,000 copies last year; Beastie Boys' &quot;Paul's Boutique&quot;
sold 22,000; and Run DMC's &quot;Raising Hell&quot; sold far less than both.

So far this year, catalog sales are down 11.7 percent, but that's
stronger than overall sales, which are down 14.7 percent, according
to Billboard. It's a major portion of the music business. This
year's total catalog sales of 95.6 million copies accounts for about
40 percent of all albums sold physically.

When people switched from cassette tapes to compact discs, catalog
sales received a windfall as people re-bought their collections. The
onset of digital downloading hasn't had that affect because CDs can
easily be downloaded to your iPod, but digital stores do have the
advantage of unlimited (virtual) store space to sell older music.

The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has
pegged catalog downloads as 64 percent of all download sales in the
U.S. (Apple declined to share its iTunes data on catalog sales.)

That still leaves illegal downloads unaccounted for, as well as a
more important quantity: cultural impact. Though bands like Sonic
Youth, the Ramones and Public Enemy may never sell as much as other
acts, their influence remains immeasurable.

&quot;Impact is not strictly about sales,&quot; says Fricke. &quot;Otherwise
everyone would be running around forming bands that sound exactly
like Poison.&quot;

I read this article in several of the fan forums; however, it is good of
you to post it here. The most interesting part of the article is:

&quot; Michael Jackson, OF COURSE, still has one of the most desirable back
catalogs. His best selling 'Thriller' moves over 60,000 a year, and his
'Number Ones' collection yielded 162,000 last year.&quot;

General Pam,
&quot;I'm Your Huckleberry&quot;

&quot;The vindictive persecutor decided that it was more important to FRAME
an INNOCENT man, Michael Jackson, than to pursue charges against one of
his own officers who MOLESTED a teenage girl- a REAL victim.&quot;

Even if the reported $1.90/unit figure is correct (and it wouldn't be as
much as that for all his albums), it's chump change, Pam.  It doesn't
even cover the interest on his loans.

Actually, the most interesting (and amusing) part of the article is
the fact that a Christmas album outsold MJ handily:

The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;
(1996) continues to be a holiday favorite; it was bought 289,000
times last year.

Think about it. MJ's best-known record (Thriller) can't even match
the sales of a record most people play only about three weeks out of
the whole year.

I can't argue with you. I still like it.

It's also what Johnny Depp is to acting, but you know how I feel about
him.

Not really... Manheim Steamroller is kind of like Christmas Muzak
(albeit very well done) whereas Trans-Siberian is kind of a mix of
classical music and hard rock - with vocals!

I love Trans-Siberian - their CDs never disappoint.

I have &quot;Beethoven's Last Night&quot; too and I highly recommend it.

&gt; &gt; I read this article in several of the fan forums; however, it is good of
&gt; &gt; you to post it here. The most interesting part of the article is:

&gt; &gt; &quot; Michael Jackson, OF COURSE, still has one of the most desirable back
&gt; &gt; catalogs. His best selling 'Thriller' moves over 60,000 a year, and his
&gt; &gt; 'Number Ones' collection yielded 162,000 last year.&quot;

&gt; Year-to-date total, all-genre album sales
&gt; 2007 – 193.8 million
&gt; SOURCE: Nielsen SoundScan
&gt; NOTE: Data is as of the week ending June 3, 2007.

&gt; Pop quiz for ya pambo.

&gt; What percentage of the 193.8 million would wacko's Thriller sales
&gt; represent?

&gt; [_]  A.  Too small to measure.
&gt; [_]  B.  Not worth measuring.
&gt; [_]  C.  Insignificant speck of flyshit.
&gt; [_]  D.  0.030959752321981428%.

[X]  E.  All of the above.
