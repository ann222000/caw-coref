Before I begin this topic, I wish to express that no one is being singled out, and that statistical analysis and data
proves this point to be true and accurate. This has been a topic in another group and so far no one can refute that that
African American race has at least a 15 to 20 I.Q. point lower than whites, and Hispanics are further down on the scale.
We also have seen a decline in overall I.Q. scores with the exception of the Asian and Caucasian since the inception of
Affirmative Action in Public Schools in the 1960’s. This Affirmative Action has caused Colleges and Universities to
accept more minorities that are not qualified to attend there schools, and thus these schools have had to lower there
educational expectations of students.

With this in mind, should intelligence be a major factor in academia? Should Affirmative Action be repealed? Should
school segregation be re-instated to allow those who are the brightest and smartest to be amongst themselves in a school
with a greater expectation of these students?

Prior to 1955 the term “SEPARATE BUT EQUAL” existed in the United States, the Supreme Court Decision in BROWN vs. THE
BOARD OF EDUCATION said this term was unconstitutional as it did not give the African Americans the same education as
whites, since that decision our schools have been in a declining situation to where we have gone from first in education
world wide to almost dead last in education. Did the Supreme Court make the wrong decision here by allowing
de-segregation of schools? I know I will get flack here but I think they did and we need to segregate our schools again.
If all things are equal black students with black teachers should be able to teach just as well as white students with
white teachers. I also believe that a student who cannot pass the grade there in should advance to the next grade (i.e.
if a student cannot pass 1st grade, he/she should not be allowed into 2nd grade). And those who graduate from high
school need to perform at 12th grade level education.

Tell me what you think.

well, my kids are white and they can't get it right with THEM let alone anyone else. i've requested to have 3 of my children held back at certain points in their lives and i've had to FIGHT for this. right now i want my 8th grader held back, i requested it last year when we changed schools but no, they don't hold children back anymore, it harms their little psyches. sigh. so my oldest son graduated with a 4th grade reading level and my youngest son is falling through every academic crack known to mankind and IN THE MEANTIME all they learn is how take the test at the end of the school year so the schools can get their funding. it UTTERLY SUCKS.

So Debra what you are essentially saying is the school system has failed the way it is now, which I agree with you whole
heartily. The dumbing down of America’s schools is because teachers are not held accountable, school districts are not
held accountable to the local people of that district and the Federal Government has its nose in a place where it does
not need to be. The stupid “NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT” is the worst thing that could have come out of Congress (and yes I
blame President Bush for it also). But the start happened in the late 1950’s and continues on today primarily due to PC,
NTA, and Civil Rights that FORCE bussing on school districts where segregation exist in suburban areas (the City of Los
Angeles is a primary example, students are bussed as much as 4 hours one way to meet de-segregation laws, imagine your
child having to get up at 3:00 A.M. to be at a bus stop by 4:00 A.M. and not getting home until 7:00 – 8:00 P.M., this
happens in the Los Angeles Unified School District).

Debra, I feel sorry for you, I wish you had control over you children when it comes to education, but until America
stands up and repeals certain laws and actions this will continue.

AMERICAN EDUCATION FAILS BECAUSE IT ISN'T EDUCATION

By Tom DeWeese
December 10, 2007
NewsWithViews.com

The debate over public education grows more heated. Regularly, reports are released showing that the academic abilities
of American students continue to fall when compared to those in other countries.

Twenty years ago the U.S. ranked first in the world in the number of young adults who had high school diplomas and
college degrees. Today we rank ninth and seventh, respectively, among industrialized nations. Compared to Europe and
Asia, 15-year-olds in the United States are below average in applying math skills to real-life tasks. The United States
ranks 18 out of 24 industrialized nations in terms of relative effectiveness of its education system. Knowledge in
history, geography, grammar, civics and literature are all in decline in terms of academic understanding and
achievement.

To solve the crisis, politicians, community leaders, and the education community all preach the same mantra. Students
fail, they tell us, because &quot;expectations haven't been set high enough.&quot; We need more &quot;accountability,&quot; they say. And
every education leader and nearly every politician presents the same &quot;solution&quot; to the education crisis: more money,
better pay for teachers, and smaller classroom numbers so the children get enough attention from the teachers.

Consequently, there are two specific categories in which the U.S. excels, compared to the rest of the world. First, the
U.S. ranks second in the world in the amount we spend per student per year on education = $11,152. The U.S. is also a
leader in having some of the smallest classroom numbers in the world. Yet the slide continues. American students grow
more illiterate by the year. How can that be? We're doing everything the &quot;experts&quot; tell us to do. We're spending the
money. We're building more and more schools. We're raising teachers' pay.

Every American should understand that these three items: higher pay, smaller classrooms and more money for schools are
the specific agenda of the National Education Association (NEA). The NEA is not a professional organization for
teachers. It is a labor union and its sole job is to get more money into the education system, and more pay for its
members. It also seeks to make work easier for its members - smaller classrooms. Clearly the NEA is not about education
- it's about money and a political agenda.

Clearly the nation's education system is not teaching the children. They can't read or work math problems without a
calculator. They can't spell, find their own country on a map, name the president of the United States or quote a single
founding father. America's children are becoming just plain dumb.

Yet we have been focusing on a massive national campaign to &quot;fix&quot; the schools for the past decade or more. Now we have
ultra high-tech, carpeted, air-conditioned school buildings with computers and television sets. We have education
programs full of new ideas, new methods, and new directions. In the 1990's we set &quot;national standards,&quot; accountability
through &quot;national testing&quot; through Goals 2000. Through that program we declared that every child would come to school
&quot;ready to learn,&quot; &quot;no child would be left behind,&quot; and pledged that our kids would be &quot;second to none&quot; in the world.
Above all, we've spent money, money and more money. The result, American students have fallen further behind, placing
19th out of 21 nations in math, 16th in science, and dead last in physics.

With all the programs and attention on education, how can that be? To coin a well-worn clich-&quot;it's the programs,
stupid.&quot; More precisely, it's the federal programs and the education bureaucracy that run them. It is simply a fact that
over the past twenty years America's education system has been completely restructured to deliberately move away from
teaching basic academics to a system that focuses on little more than training students for menial jobs. The fact is,
the restructured education system has been designed to deliberately dumb-down the children. (Note: the NEA hates that
phrase!)

Most Americans find that statement to be astonishing and, in fact, to be beyond belief. Parents don't want to let go of
their child-like faith that the American education system is the best in the world, designed to give their children the
academic strength to make them the smartest in the world. Politicians continue to offer old solutions of more money and
more federal attention, almost stamping their feet, demanding that kids learn something. Programs are being proposed
that call for teacher testing to hold them accountable for producing educated children. More programs call for annual
tests to find out if children have learned anything. The nation is in panic. But none of these hysterical responses will
improve education - because none of them address the very root of the problem.

The truth is, none of the problems will go away, nor will children learn until both parents and politicians stop
trusting the education establishment and start ridding the system of its failed ideas and programs. Parents and
politicians must stop believing the propaganda handed down by the education establishment that says teaching a child in
the twenty-first century is different and must be more high tech than in days past. It simply isn't so.

THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM

Today's education system is driven by money from the federal government and private foundations, both working
hand-in-hand with the education establishment headquartered in the federal Department of Education and manned by the
National Education Association (NEA). These forces have combined with psychologists, huge textbook publishers, teacher
colleges, the healthcare profession, government bureaucrats, big corporations, pharmaceutical companies and social
workers to invade local school boards, classrooms and private homes in the name of &quot;fixing&quot; education.

The record shows that each of these entities has benefited from this alliance through enriched coffers and increased
political power. In fact, the new education restructuring is working wonders for everyone involved - except for the
children and their parents. As a result of this combined invasion force, today's classroom is a very different place
from only a few years ago.

There is simply not enough room on these pages to tell the entire history of education restructuring and transformation.
It dates back to the early efforts by psychologists like John Dewey, whose work began to change how teachers were taught
to teach in the nation's teacher colleges. The changes were drastic as education moved away from an age-old system that
taught teachers how to motivate students to accept the whole scope of academic information available. Instead the new
system explored methods to maneuver students through psychological behavior modification processes. Rather than to
instill knowledge, once such a power was established the education process became more of a method to instill specific
agendas into the minds of children.

As fantastic as it seems, the entire history of the education restructuring effort is carefully and thoroughly
documented in a book called HYPERLINK &quot; http://www.newswithviews.com/HNB/Hot_New_Books11.htm &quot;The Deliberate Dumbing Down
of America. The book was written by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt, a former official at the Department of Education in the
Reagan Administration. While there in 1981 - 1982, Charlotte found the &quot;mother lode&quot; hidden away at the Department. In
short, she found all of the education establishment's plans for restructuring America's classrooms. Not only did she
find the plans for what they intended to do, she discovered how they were going to do it and most importantly why. Since
uncovering this monstrous plan, Charlotte Iserbyt has dedicated her life to getting that information into the hands of
parents, politicians and the news media

Iserbyt's work details how the process to restructure America's education system began at the beginning of the Twentieth
Century and slowly picked up speed over the decades. The new system used psychology-based curriculum to slowly change
the attitudes, values and beliefs of the students.

The new school agenda was very different from most peoples' understanding of the purpose of American education. NEA
leader William Carr, secretary of the Educational Policies Commission, clearly stated that new agenda when in 1947 he
wrote in the &quot;NEA Journal:&quot; &quot;The teaching profession prepares the leaders of the future... The statesmen, the
industrialists, the lawyers, the newspapermen...all the leaders of tomorrow are in schools today.&quot; Carr went on to
write: &quot;The psychological foundations for wider loyalties must be laid...Teach those attitudes which will result
ultimately in the creation of a world citizenship and world government... we can and should teach those skills and
attitudes which will help to create a society in which world citizenship is possible.&quot;

Professor Benjamin Bloom, called the Father of Outcome-based Education (OBE) said: &quot;The purpose of education and the
schools is to change the thoughts, feelings and actions of students.&quot; B.F. Skinner determined that applied psychology in
the class curriculum was the means to bring about such changes in the students values and beliefs simply by relentlessly
inputting specific programmed messages. Skinner once bragged: &quot;I could make a pigeon a high achiever by reinforcing it
on a proper schedule.&quot; Whole psychological studies were produced to prove that individuals could be made to believe
anything, even to accept that black was white, given the proper programming.

I can totally agree with you and Bill on the condition of our public
schools. What I don't see is any proof of a causative link with
desegregation, or affirmative action. The timing could very well be no
more than coincidence. Show causation. Without showing that it is just
an unsupported hypothesis.

&gt; exist in suburban areas (the City of Los Angeles is a primary example,
&gt; students are bussed as much as 4 hours one way to meet de-segregation
&gt; laws, imagine your child having to get up at 3:00 A.M. to be at a bus
&gt; stop by 4:00 A.M. and not getting home until 7:00 -- 8:00 P.M., this
&gt; happens in the Los Angeles Unified School District).

&gt; Debra, I feel sorry for you, I wish you had control over you children
&gt; when it comes to education, but until America stands up and repeals
&gt; certain laws and actions this will continue.

&gt; well, my kids are white and they can't get it right with THEM let

&gt; at certain points in their lives and i've had to FIGHT for this. right
&gt; now i want my 8th grader held back, i requested it last year when we
&gt; changed schools but no, they don't hold children back anymore, it
&gt; harms their little psyches. sigh. so my oldest son graduated with a
&gt; 4th grade reading level and my youngest son is falling through every
&gt; academic crack known to mankind and IN THE MEANTIME all they learn is
&gt; how take the test at the end of the school year so the schools can get

&gt; Before I begin this topic, I wish to express that no one is being

&gt; far no one can refute that that African American race has at least a
&gt; 15 to 20 I.Q. point lower than whites, and Hispanics are further down
&gt; on the scale. We also have seen a decline in overall I.Q. scores with
&gt; the exception of the Asian and Caucasian since the inception of
&gt; Affirmative Action in Public Schools in the 1960's. This Affirmative
&gt; Action has caused Colleges and Universities to accept more minorities
&gt; that are not qualified to attend there schools, and thus these schools
&gt; have had to lower there educational expectations of students.

&gt; With this in mind, should intelligence be a major factor in academia?
&gt; Should Affirmative Action be repealed? Should school segregation be
&gt; re-instated to allow those who are the brightest and smartest to be
&gt; amongst themselves in a school with a greater expectation of these
&gt; students?

&gt; Prior to 1955 the term *&quot;SEPARATE BUT EQUAL&quot;* existed in the United
&gt; States, the Supreme Court Decision in *BROWN vs. THE BOARD OF
&gt; EDUCATION* said this term was unconstitutional as it did not give the
&gt; African Americans the same education as whites, since that decision
&gt; our schools have been in a declining situation to where we have gone
&gt; from first in education world wide to almost dead last in education.
&gt; Did the Supreme Court make the wrong decision here by allowing
&gt; de-segregation of schools? I know I will get flack here but I think
&gt; they did and we need to segregate our schools again. If all things are
&gt; equal black students with black teachers should be able to teach just
&gt; as well as white students with white teachers. I also believe that a
&gt; student who cannot pass the grade there in should advance to the next
&gt; grade (i.e. if a student cannot pass 1^st grade, he/she should not be
&gt; allowed into 2^nd grade). And those who graduate from high school need
&gt; to perform at 12^th grade level education.

&gt; *AMERICAN EDUCATION FAILS BECAUSE IT ISN'T EDUCATION*

&gt; By Tom DeWeese
&gt; December 10, 2007
&gt; NewsWithViews.com

&gt; The debate over public education grows more heated. *_Regularly,
&gt; reports are released showing that the academic abilities of American
&gt; students continue to fall when compared to those in other countries. _*

&gt; *_Twenty years ago the _**_U.S._**_ ranked first in the world_* in the
&gt; number of young adults who had high school diplomas and college
&gt; degrees. *_Today we rank ninth and seventh, respectively, among
&gt; industrialized nations. Compared to _**_Europe_**_ and _**_Asia_**_,
&gt; 15-year-olds in the _**_United States_**_ are below average in
&gt; applying math skills to real-life tasks._**_ The _**_United States_**_
&gt; ranks 18 out of 24 industrialized nations in terms of relative
&gt; effectiveness of its education system. Knowledge in history,
&gt; geography, grammar, civics and literature are all in decline in terms
&gt; of academic understanding and achievement._**_ _*

&gt; *To solve the crisis, politicians, community leaders, and the
&gt; education community all preach the same mantra. Students fail, they
&gt; tell us, because &quot;expectations haven't been set high enough.&quot; We need
&gt; more &quot;accountability,&quot; they say. And every education leader and nearly
&gt; every politician presents the same &quot;solution&quot; to the education
&gt; crisis*:*_ more money, better pay for teachers, and smaller classroom
&gt; numbers so the children get enough attention from the teachers. _*

&gt; *Consequently, there are two specific categories in which the **U.S.**
&gt; excels, compared to the rest of the world. First, the **U.S.** ranks
&gt; second in the world in the amount we spend per student per year on
&gt; education = $11,152. The **U.S.** is also a leader in having some of
&gt; the smallest classroom numbers in the world. *Yet the slide continues.
&gt; American students grow more illiterate by the year. How can that be?
&gt; We're doing everything the &quot;experts&quot; tell us to do. We're spending the
&gt; money. We're building more and more schools. We're raising teachers' pay.

&gt; Every American should understand that these three items: higher pay,
&gt; smaller classrooms and more money for schools are the specific agenda
&gt; of *the National Education Association (NEA). The NEA is not a
&gt; professional organization for teachers. It is a labor union and its
&gt; sole job is to get more money into the education system, and more pay
&gt; for its members. It also seeks to make work easier for its members -
&gt; smaller classrooms. Clearly the NEA is not about education - it's
&gt; about money and a political agenda. *

&gt; *_Clearly the nation's education system is not teaching the
&gt; children._**_ _*They can't read or work math problems without a
&gt; calculator. They can't spell, find their own country on a map, name
&gt; the president of the United States or quote a single founding father.
&gt; America's children are becoming just plain dumb.

&gt; *_Yet we have been focusing on a massive national campaign to &quot;fix&quot;
&gt; the schools for the past decade or more. Now we have ultra high-tech,
&gt; carpeted, air-conditioned school buildings with computers and
&gt; television sets. We have education programs full of new ideas, new
&gt; methods, and new directions. In the 1990's we set &quot;national
&gt; standards,&quot; accountability through &quot;national testing&quot; through Goals
&gt; 2000. Through that program we declared that every child would come to
&gt; school &quot;ready to learn,&quot; &quot;no child would be left behind,&quot; and pledged
&gt; that our kids would be &quot;second to none&quot; in the world. Above all, we've
&gt; spent money, money and more money. The result, American students have
&gt; fallen further behind, placing 19th out of 21 nations in math, 16th in
&gt; science, and dead last in physics. _*

&gt; With all the programs and attention on education, how can that be? To
&gt; coin a well-worn clich-*_&quot;it's the programs, stupid.&quot;_* More
&gt; precisely, it's the federal programs and the education bureaucracy
&gt; that run them. *It is simply a fact that over the past twenty years
&gt; **America**'s education system has been completely restructured to
&gt; deliberately move away from teaching basic academics to a system that
&gt; focuses on little more than training students for menial jobs. The
&gt; fact is, the restructured education system has been designed to
&gt; **_deliberately dumb-down the children_**. (Note: the NEA hates that
&gt; phrase!) *

&gt; *_Most Americans find that statement to be astonishing and, in fact,
&gt; to be beyond belief_*. Parents don't want to let go of their
&gt; child-like faith that the American education system is the best in the
&gt; world, designed to give their children the academic strength to make
&gt; them the smartest in the world. Politicians continue to offer old
&gt; solutions of more money and more federal attention, almost stamping
&gt; their feet, demanding that kids learn something. Programs are being
&gt; proposed that call for teacher testing to hold them accountable for
&gt; producing educated children. More programs call for annual tests to
&gt; find out if children have learned anything. The nation is in panic.
&gt; But none of these hysterical responses will improve education -
&gt; because none of them address the very root of the problem.

&gt; *_The truth is, none of the problems will go away, nor will children
&gt; learn until both parents and politicians stop trusting the education
&gt; establishment and start ridding the system of its failed ideas and
&gt; programs. Parents and politicians must stop believing the propaganda
&gt; handed down by the education establishment that says teaching a child
&gt; in the twenty-first century is different and must be more high tech
&gt; than in days past. It simply isn't so. _*

&gt; *THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM*

&gt; Today's education system is driven by money from the federal
&gt; government and private foundations, both working hand-in-hand with the
&gt; education establishment headquartered in the federal Department of
&gt; Education and manned by the National Education Association (NEA).
&gt; These forces have combined with psychologists, huge textbook
&gt; publishers, teacher colleges, the healthcare profession, government
&gt; bureaucrats, big corporations, pharmaceutical companies and social
&gt; workers to invade local school boards, classrooms and private homes in
&gt; the name of &quot;fixing&quot; education.

&gt; The record shows that each of these entities has benefited from this
&gt; alliance through enriched coffers and increased political power. In
&gt; fact, the new education restructuring is working wonders for everyone
&gt; involved - except for the children and their parents. As a result of
&gt; this combined invasion force, today's classroom is a very different
&gt; place from only a few years ago.

&gt; There is simply not enough room on these pages to tell the entire
&gt; history of education restructuring and transformation. It dates back
&gt; to the early efforts by psychologists like John Dewey, whose work
&gt; began to change how teachers were taught to teach in the nation's
&gt; teacher colleges. The changes were drastic as education moved away
&gt; from an age-old system that taught teachers how to motivate students
&gt; to accept the whole scope of academic information available. Instead
&gt; the new system explored methods to maneuver students through
&gt; psychological behavior modification processes. *_Rather than to
&gt; instill knowledge, once such a power was established the education
&gt; process became more of a method to instill specific agendas into the
&gt; minds of children. _*

&gt; As fantastic as it seems, the entire history of the education
&gt; restructuring effort is carefully and thoroughly documented in a book
&gt; called The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America
&gt; &lt; http://www.newswithviews.com/HNB/Hot_New_Books11.htm &gt;. *_The book was
&gt; written by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt, a former official at the
&gt; Department of Education in the Reagan Administration. While there in
&gt; 1981 - 1982, _**_Charlotte_**_ found the &quot;mother lode&quot; hidden away at
&gt; the Department. In short, she found all of the education
&gt; establishment's plans for restructuring _**_America_**_'s classrooms.
&gt; Not only did she find the plans for what they intended to do, she
&gt; discovered how they were going to do it and most importantly why.
&gt; Since uncovering this monstrous plan, Charlotte Iserbyt has dedicated
&gt; her life to getting that information into the hands of parents,
&gt; politicians and the news media_**_ _*

But the start happened in the late 1950's and continues on today primarily due to PC, NTA, and Civil Rights that FORCE bussing on school districts where segregation exist in suburban areas (the City of Los Angeles is a primary example, students are bussed as much as 4 hours one way to meet de-segregation laws, imagine your child having to get up at 3:00 A.M. to be at a bus stop by 4:00 A.M. and not getting home until 7:00 - 8:00 P.M., this happens in the Los Angeles Unified School District).

Debra, I feel sorry for you, I wish you had control over you children when it comes to education, but until America stands up and repeals certain laws and actions this will continue.

well, my kids are white and they can't get it right with THEM let alone anyone else. i've requested to have 3 of my children held back at certain points in their lives and i've had to FIGHT for this. right now i want my 8th grader held back, i requested it last year when we changed schools but no, they don't hold children back anymore, it harms their little psyches. sigh. so my oldest son graduated with a 4th grade reading level and my youngest son is falling through every academic crack known to mankind and IN THE MEANTIME all they learn is how take the test at the end of the school year so the schools can get their funding. it UTTERLY SUCKS.

Before I begin this topic, I wish to express that no one is being singled out, and that statistical analysis and data proves this point to be true and accurate. This has been a topic in another group and so far no one can refute that that African American race has at least a 15 to 20 I.Q. point lower than whites, and Hispanics are further down on the scale. We also have seen a decline in overall I.Q. scores with the exception of the Asian and Caucasian since the inception of Affirmative Action in Public Schools in the 1960's. This Affirmative Action has caused Colleges and Universities to accept more minorities that are not qualified to attend there schools, and thus these schools have had to lower there educational expectations of students.

With this in mind, should intelligence be a major factor in academia? Should Affirmative Action be repealed? Should school segregation be re-instated to allow those who are the brightest and smartest to be amongst themselves in a school with a greater expectation of these students?

Prior to 1955 the term &quot;SEPARATE BUT EQUAL&quot; existed in the United States, the Supreme Court Decision in BROWN vs. THE BOARD OF EDUCATION said this term was unconstitutional as it did not give the African Americans the same education as whites, since that decision our schools have been in a declining situation to where we have gone from first in education world wide to almost dead last in education. Did the Supreme Court make the wrong decision here by allowing de-segregation of schools? I know I will get flack here but I think they did and we need to segregate our schools again. If all things are equal black students with black teachers should be able to teach just as well as white students with white teachers. I also believe that a student who cannot pass the grade there in should advance to the next grade (i.e. if a student cannot pass 1st grade, he/she should not be allowed into 2nd grade). And those who graduate from high school need to perform at 12th grade level education.

Tell me what you think.

AMERICAN EDUCATION FAILS BECAUSE IT ISN'T EDUCATION

By Tom DeWeese
December 10, 2007
NewsWithViews.com

The debate over public education grows more heated. Regularly, reports are released showing that the academic abilities
of American students continue to fall when compared to those in other countries.

Twenty years ago the U.S. ranked first in the world in the number of young adults who had high school diplomas and
college degrees. Today we rank ninth and seventh, respectively, among industrialized nations. Compared to Europe and
Asia, 15-year-olds in the United States are below average in applying math skills to real-life tasks. The United States
ranks 18 out of 24 industrialized nations in terms of relative effectiveness of its education system. Knowledge in
history, geography, grammar, civics and literature are all in decline in terms of academic understanding and
achievement.

To solve the crisis, politicians, community leaders, and the education community all preach the same mantra. Students
fail, they tell us, because &quot;expectations haven't been set high enough.&quot; We need more &quot;accountability,&quot; they say. And
every education leader and nearly every politician presents the same &quot;solution&quot; to the education crisis: more money,
better pay for teachers, and smaller classroom numbers so the children get enough attention from the teachers.

Consequently, there are two specific categories in which the U.S. excels, compared to the rest of the world. First, the
U.S. ranks second in the world in the amount we spend per student per year on education = $11,152. The U.S. is also a
leader in having some of the smallest classroom numbers in the world. Yet the slide continues. American students grow
more illiterate by the year. How can that be? We're doing everything the &quot;experts&quot; tell us to do. We're spending the
money. We're building more and more schools. We're raising teachers' pay.

Every American should understand that these three items: higher pay, smaller classrooms and more money for schools are
the specific agenda of the National Education Association (NEA). The NEA is not a professional organization for
teachers. It is a labor union and its sole job is to get more money into the education system, and more pay for its
members. It also seeks to make work easier for its members - smaller classrooms. Clearly the NEA is not about education
- it's about money and a political agenda.

Clearly the nation's education system is not teaching the children. They can't read or work math problems without a
calculator. They can't spell, find their own country on a map, name the president of the United States or quote a single
founding father. America's children are becoming just plain dumb.

Yet we have been focusing on a massive national campaign to &quot;fix&quot; the schools for the past decade or more. Now we have
ultra high-tech, carpeted, air-conditioned school buildings with computers and television sets. We have education
programs full of new ideas, new methods, and new directions. In the 1990's we set &quot;national standards,&quot; accountability
through &quot;national testing&quot; through Goals 2000. Through that program we declared that every child would come to school
&quot;ready to learn,&quot; &quot;no child would be left behind,&quot; and pledged that our kids would be &quot;second to none&quot; in the world.
Above all, we've spent money, money and more money. The result, American students have fallen further behind, placing
19th out of 21 nations in math, 16th in science, and dead last in physics.

With all the programs and attention on education, how can that be? To coin a well-worn clich-&quot;it's the programs,
stupid.&quot; More precisely, it's the federal programs and the education bureaucracy that run them. It is simply a fact that
over the past twenty years America's education system has been completely restructured to deliberately move away from
teaching basic academics to a system that focuses on little more than training students for menial jobs. The fact is,
the restructured education system has been designed to deliberately dumb-down the children. (Note: the NEA hates that
phrase!)

Most Americans find that statement to be astonishing and, in fact, to be beyond belief. Parents don't want to let go of
their child-like faith that the American education system is the best in the world, designed to give their children the
academic strength to make them the smartest in the world. Politicians continue to offer old solutions of more money and
more federal attention, almost stamping their feet, demanding that kids learn something. Programs are being proposed
that call for teacher testing to hold them accountable for producing educated children. More programs call for annual
tests to find out if children have learned anything. The nation is in panic. But none of these hysterical responses will
improve education - because none of them address the very root of the problem.

The truth is, none of the problems will go away, nor will children learn until both parents and politicians stop
trusting the education establishment and start ridding the system of its failed ideas and programs. Parents and
politicians must stop believing the propaganda handed down by the education establishment that says teaching a child in
the twenty-first century is different and must be more high tech than in days past. It simply isn't so.

THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM

Today's education system is driven by money from the federal government and private foundations, both working
hand-in-hand with the education establishment headquartered in the federal Department of Education and manned by the
National Education Association (NEA). These forces have combined with psychologists, huge textbook publishers, teacher
colleges, the healthcare profession, government bureaucrats, big corporations, pharmaceutical companies and social
workers to invade local school boards, classrooms and private homes in the name of &quot;fixing&quot; education.

The record shows that each of these entities has benefited from this alliance through enriched coffers and increased
political power. In fact, the new education restructuring is working wonders for everyone involved - except for the
children and their parents. As a result of this combined invasion force, today's classroom is a very different place
from only a few years ago.

There is simply not enough room on these pages to tell the entire history of education restructuring and transformation.
It dates back to the early efforts by psychologists like John Dewey, whose work began to change how teachers were taught
to teach in the nation's teacher colleges. The changes were drastic as education moved away from an age-old system that
taught teachers how to motivate students to accept the whole scope of academic information available. Instead the new
system explored methods to maneuver students through psychological behavior modification processes. Rather than to
instill knowledge, once such a power was established the education process became more of a method to instill specific
agendas into the minds of children.

As fantastic as it seems, the entire history of the education restructuring effort is carefully and thoroughly
documented in a book called HYPERLINK &quot; http://www.newswithviews.com/HNB/Hot_New_Books11.htm &quot;The Deliberate Dumbing Down
of America. The book was written by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt, a former official at the Department of Education in the
Reagan Administration. While there in 1981 - 1982, Charlotte found the &quot;mother lode&quot; hidden away at the Department. In
short, she found all of the education establishment's plans for restructuring America's classrooms. Not only did she
find the plans for what they intended to do, she discovered how they were going to do it and most importantly why. Since
uncovering this monstrous plan, Charlotte Iserbyt has dedicated her life to getting that information into the hands of
parents, politicians and the news media

Iserbyt's work details how the process to restructure America's education system began at the beginning of the Twentieth
Century and slowly picked up speed over the decades. The new system used psychology-based curriculum to slowly change
the attitudes, values and beliefs of the students.

The new school agenda was very different from most peoples' understanding of the purpose of American education. NEA
leader William Carr, secretary of the Educational Policies Commission, clearly stated that new agenda when in 1947 he
wrote in the &quot;NEA Journal:&quot; &quot;The teaching profession prepares the leaders of the future... The statesmen, the
industrialists, the lawyers, the newspapermen...all the leaders of tomorrow are in schools today.&quot; Carr went on to
write: &quot;The psychological foundations for wider loyalties must be laid...Teach those attitudes which will result
ultimately in the creation of a world citizenship and world government... we can and should teach those skills and
attitudes which will help to create a society in which world citizenship is possible.&quot;
