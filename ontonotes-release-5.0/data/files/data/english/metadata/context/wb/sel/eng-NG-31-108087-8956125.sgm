As I consider which way to go with my next bike, Harley looks like the
winner to me, not considering the bike itself. As for the bike, a road
King is looking real good to me.

In my area, we have two dealerships:

1. Honda/Kaw/Suz/Yam
- owned by one of the largest car dealerships in the area
- exclusive franchise within a 45-90 minute radius; 2nd in size to
largest dealer in this service area
- discourages sitting on the bikes
- no test rides allowed under any circumstances
- does not sponsor rides; HRCA sponsor 45 mins away at dealer that
only sells Hondas

2. Harley shop
- co-owned with another Harley dealer an hour away
- exclusive franchise within a 60-90 minute radius
- encourages sitting on bikes
- may let you test ride, if they know you're planning to walk out with
a bike
- sponsors rides left and right

On presale service...

The HKSY dealer does not have presale service and they won't invent
for you.

The Harley dealer has presale service for $1900 for life, including
maintenance items like oil changes, which they will do every 2500 mi
instead of the recommended 5K mi. State inspections are also included.
Tire repair/replacement is prorated based on how much tire life is
left.

On selling new bikes...

The HKSY dealer sells for MSRP+; the plus is a $249 service fee and up
to $800 for a n new bike assembly fee. You get a free helmet of your
choice (that they sell) with each new bike.

The Harley dealer is MSRP, but you'll end up with a windshield,
sissybar, and other stuff thrown in.

On customer appreciation...

The HKSY does not regularly hold customer-appreciation days (my son
bought a bike from them). I say &quot;regularly&quot; to give them the benefit
of the doubt that they may have in the past, but AFAIK, they have
never done it.

The Harley dealer periodically throws customer appreciation days. I
know at least 6 or 7 recent customers of the dealership and have seen
it advertised as well.

On servicing bikes...

The HKSY dealer will not service you right away; they make you wait
for a few days. If you bought the bike from them, they do their best
to do the work while you wait. That's the one bennie they offer - fast
turnaround on service if you buy from them; new or used. Additionally,
they will not service a bike that is 10 years older or more unless you
bought it form them.

The harley dealer treats you like you bought the bike from them no
matter where your harley came from. While there's no service-while-u-
wait deal, you don't wait any longer than anybody else. Not sure on
the age aspect, though, since the folks I know hve bikes no mroe than
10 years old.

What's your problem with the VTX1800, did your son graduate
already, or did he wheedle it out of you early?

Anyone who thinks ANYTHING should be charged for an &quot;assembly fee&quot;
should watch just what is involved with it.

It takes longer to remove the bike from it's metal shipping crate than
it does to attach the front wheel and pump the front brake a few times
to build up initial pressure.  At the Suzuki dealership I worked at a
few years ago, it took longer for me to dig out the bike from the
warehouse than it did to put it together and take a test ride.

Not much point in 'test riding' what you've already decided to

What do they do it you come in, test ride, and then tell them
you need to go check out some other brands, you'll be back if you're

Personally I'm buying a bike, not a store.  I don't expect to ever see
the dealer again except to buy parts.  I don't expect the dealer to
fix anything, and so far they've not disappointed me in that
expectation.  Even 20 years ago if you went in for an oil change you
needed to check afterwards to make sure that it was actually changed.
And if by some miracle you do find a good one, don't expect them to
_stay_ good.

&gt; What's your problem with the VTX1800, did your son graduate

Nah, he says he probably won't want it. If he does, he can have it. A
deal's a deal. Else I'll do my best to give him some seed cash to buy
what he really wants - a new sportbike.

As for me, I'm talking about something newer. My X is a 2002, so it's
already 6 model years old. I'm in no rush, though.

An aside: I went for a group ride yesterday for the Heart Assoc. Along
for the trip was a local cop - young guy - riding a Triump Daytona 955
(or 995, whatever). He told me about wanting to switch to a cruiser
for more comfort on longer trips. He had condsidered the X1800, but
the local Honda dealer I was talking about didn't carry the 1800's
anymore... too expensive (only because they want just $16,000 out the
door for the damned thing - $14KMSRP+$1000prep+tax/title/tags). Since
he had never had a chance to test ride one, I let him take mine after
the ride, while I started in on the lunch that was provided. When he
came back, he hands me the keys and says, &quot;I'll take it&quot;. Of course,
it's not for sale - son, grad deal, etc.

&gt; &gt; The harley dealer treats you like you bought the bike from them no

I just love my RK. Although Glendale Harley has really nice guys working
there and does everything you say, their service SUCKS! I'll make an
appointment for some work, which takes almost two weeks. Then, even though I
had an appointment, the bike will sit in the shop for another two weeks,
after I make my appointment. And, you can almost count on parts (bling, the
stuff you like). missing when I pick the bike up. Or an oil leak from the
filter or drain after an oil change. Sometimes they just leave the spilled
oil on the bike so it looks like it leaks, after it's service. Really nice
guys though, hot dogs and Harley Girls on weekends, test rides (if they know
you mean business) good prices and everything. The finance manager has great
tits, as well.
The sales manager stayed at the dealership until late at night to sell me my
V-Rod. But the service SUCKS. Yet, I bought a service contract with my
V-Rod, as it will save me almost 3K over the 20,000 miles of it's life. The
V-Rod servicing is expensive.

Trying to escape the carelessness of Glendale, I had Van Nuys Harley
Davidson put a set of Vance and Hines True Duals on the bike. It ran so
poorly, after I picked it up, that I thought I had put so much hot rod shit
on it that I thought I had ruined it.

I eventually came to my senses and called Rudy at Las Vegas Harley Davidson
and trucked the bike up there.

On one Saturday, without any fanfare, LVHD righted the King and turned it
into an amazing performer (for a Harley). They had previously done major
engine work for me, in ONE Saturday, so I could take the bike home on
Sunday. This included (but not at the same time) a six speed screaming eagle
transmission, S&amp;S 510 cams with a 95&quot; big bore kit. Unfortunately,
sometimes, Vegas trips cost me big money, as I love to play Blackjack.

So if there's any real problem with the Harleys it's that their underpowered
(on purpose) and some of the So.Cal. Dealer service sucks.

I won't go into my horror stories with Bartels.

Any hot rod shit you'll want to add can't be performed by a California
dealership. You have to go to an independent (not recommended) or out of
state.

I'm not trying to knock Harley, here. As I've got horror stories from my
dealings with BMW dealer service as well. And I'm sure the Japanese riders
here have their own stories.

&gt; &gt;2. Harley shop
&gt; &gt;- may let you test ride, if they know you're planning to walk out with
&gt; &gt;a bike

&gt;         Not much point in 'test riding' what you've already decided to
&gt; take home, eh ?

&gt;         What do they do it you come in, test ride, and then tell them
&gt; you need to go check out some other brands, you'll be back if you're
&gt; still interested.  Then you come back a week later and say you want to
&gt; test ride something else ?

&gt; &gt;- sponsors rides left and right

&gt;         Which costs them somewhere between nothing and lunch money.

&gt; &gt;On presale service...

&gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer does not have presale service and they won't invent
&gt; &gt;for you.

&gt; &gt;The Harley dealer has presale service for $1900 for life, including

&gt;         Say WHAT ?  On average, how long to you keep a bike, Greg ?
&gt; Seems like maybe ~ 3 months.  The dealer figures anyone who buys that,
&gt; on average, will be selling or trading the bike within a year or two
&gt; anyway.  Or at least 8 out of 10 will.

&gt; &gt;maintenance items like oil changes, which they will do every 2500 mi
&gt; &gt;instead of the recommended 5K mi. State inspections are also included.

&gt;         Costs them nothing to tell the mechanic to slap a sticker on
&gt; it.

&gt; &gt;Tire repair/replacement is prorated based on how much tire life is
&gt; &gt;left.

&gt; &gt;On selling new bikes...

&gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer sells for MSRP+; the plus is a $249 service fee and up
&gt; &gt;to $800 for a n new bike assembly fee.

&gt;         Wow - they come disassembled, like a bicycle ?  I didn't know
&gt; that !  ( &lt;/sarcasm&gt; ).  Or is that for adding farkles that A ) you
&gt; pay through the ASS for their limited selection, and B ) takes their
&gt; mechanic an hour to throw on ?

&gt; &gt; You get a free helmet of your
&gt; &gt;choice (that they sell) with each new bike.

&gt;         Wow. $ 25 discount right there ! :-)

&gt; &gt;The Harley dealer is MSRP, but you'll end up with a windshield,
&gt; &gt;sissybar, and other stuff thrown in.

&gt; &gt;On customer appreciation...

&gt; &gt;The HKSY does not regularly hold customer-appreciation days (my son
&gt; &gt;bought a bike from them). I say &quot;regularly&quot; to give them the benefit
&gt; &gt;of the doubt that they may have in the past, but AFAIK, they have
&gt; &gt;never done it.

&gt; &gt;The Harley dealer periodically throws customer appreciation days. I
&gt; &gt;know at least 6 or 7 recent customers of the dealership and have seen
&gt; &gt;it advertised as well.

&gt;         CAD's = 'sales promotions' at ANY business.

&gt; &gt;On servicing bikes...

&gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer will not service you right away; they make you wait
&gt; &gt;for a few days. If you bought the bike from them, they do their best
&gt; &gt;to do the work while you wait. That's the one bennie they offer - fast
&gt; &gt;turnaround on service if you buy from them; new or used. Additionally,

&gt;         Makes business sense.

&gt; &gt;they will not service a bike that is 10 years older or more unless you
&gt; &gt;bought it form them.

&gt; &gt;The harley dealer treats you like you bought the bike from them no
&gt; &gt;matter where your harley came from. While there's no service-while-u-
&gt; &gt;wait deal, you don't wait any longer than anybody else.

&gt;         So, you get no benefit from being their customer on that.

&gt; &gt; Not sure on
&gt; &gt;the age aspect, though, since the folks I know hve bikes no mroe than
&gt; &gt;10 years old.

&gt; &gt;Greg

&gt;         It sounds like you're on the verge of falling for the 'Harley
&gt; Family' mystique.

Knowing I could go to Chatanooga and pick up a new (prev yr) X1800 for
4-6K less than this dealership would sell for, but knowing that
factory mtc would be a PITA because of my local shop's stance on &quot;did
you buy the bike from us&quot;, I'm no longer considering only Honda for my
next bike.

The older I get, the less time I have to spend on tings and the more
important good service becomes. I keep all my home appliances under a
replacement warranty where I pay for just the warranty - even up to
the point of replacement. So, if I paid $19000 for a Harley and paid
$1900 for worry-free mtc - some, maybe most of which is honored at any
Harley dealership, I'm miles ahead.

As for how long I keep a bike... My next bike may be down the road a
piece, but if the opportunity arises, I wanna be ready :)-

Do be aware that Harley has heat management issues on some models this
year and I think last too . I've read that they need an ECM flash (enrichen
mixture) and other mods right out of the box , but have no personal
experience . You might find that used prices are coming down quite a bit now
. You could very well find a mint bike with low miles and documented service
history for a good bit less than a new one . The weekend warriors have moved
on to other fads .
That said , I'm very happy with my Evo . Slightly more maintainance than a
newer Twin Cam , but I'm a tinkerer . With a basic machine shop in my back
yard . Heh .

Yeah , but will your metric still be worth 80% or more of it's original

Plenty of people have bikes for kicking around or fixed up for show
that are 30, 40, 50+ years old. My 1982 Kawa KZ440LTD was a great bike
for knocking around on. If I could find a decent model for a good
price a 70's CB750 would be high on my list of acquisitions as would a
KZ1000.

Old bikes are cool - cheap to insure, cheap to license (can go with
antique plates), and cheap to fix (unless you run into a rare,
proprietary part).

One would think that would be covered in the MSRP, at the very
least.  Cars get all that, too - at the factory.  It's not a separate
charge when you buy it.  And $ 800 would pay for 20 hours of a
mechanics time ($ 40 / hour including bene's etc ).  2 &amp; 1/2 -  8 hour
days.  Hmmmm......

That too.. &lt;grin&gt;  The persistence of p.jm to insert himself into a
motorcycle newsgroup, make comments about others' abilities and
their choices of rides, etc. coupled with his criticism for the ones who
participate in this newsgroup with ride reports.. give cause to spec-
ulate &quot;why&quot;..

There is a reason why p.jm doesn't own a motorcycle, considering
his seemingly intense interest in a newsgroup that is based on the
participation of owning and riding.. Some of his posts do give the
impression that he doesn't think much about motorcycles or their
riders.. That being the case, why then, would he impose himself
into a newsgroup of this type ?  I'd suspect there is a very good
reason.. either legal or personal.. Whatever it is.. probably has little
to do with finances..

&gt; Plenty of people have bikes for kicking around or fixed up for show
&gt; that are 30, 40, 50+ years old. My 1982 Kawa KZ440LTD was a great bike
&gt; for knocking around on. If I could find a decent model for a good
&gt; price a 70's CB750 would be high on my list of acquisitions as would a
&gt; KZ1000.

Car's come on a transporter and, depending on where you are, the

all the plastic, stickers, road grime and make sure it's set up
properly

BTW, shop time at a dealership is closer to $75/hr and yes, I agree
that $800 is too much.
It's usually a 2-4 hour job. (depending on the bike)
When I bought my first H-D it was new and I think the roughly $800 or
so covered both freight and PDI. About $500 + $300.
That could be what is happening here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As I consider which way to go with my next bike, Harley looks like the
&gt; winner to me, not considering the bike itself. As for the bike, a road
&gt; King is looking real good to me.

&gt; In my area, we have two dealerships:

&gt; 1. Honda/Kaw/Suz/Yam
&gt; - owned by one of the largest car dealerships in the area
&gt; - exclusive franchise within a 45-90 minute radius; 2nd in size to
&gt; largest dealer in this service area
&gt; - discourages sitting on the bikes
&gt; - no test rides allowed under any circumstances
&gt; - does not sponsor rides; HRCA sponsor 45 mins away at dealer that
&gt; only sells Hondas

&gt; 2. Harley shop
&gt; - co-owned with another Harley dealer an hour away
&gt; - exclusive franchise within a 60-90 minute radius
&gt; - encourages sitting on bikes
&gt; - may let you test ride, if they know you're planning to walk out with
&gt; a bike
&gt; - sponsors rides left and right

&gt; On presale service...

&gt; The HKSY dealer does not have presale service and they won't invent
&gt; for you.

&gt; The Harley dealer has presale service for $1900 for life, including
&gt; maintenance items like oil changes, which they will do every 2500 mi
&gt; instead of the recommended 5K mi. State inspections are also included.
&gt; Tire repair/replacement is prorated based on how much tire life is
&gt; left.

&gt; On selling new bikes...

&gt; The HKSY dealer sells for MSRP+; the plus is a $249 service fee and up
&gt; to $800 for a n new bike assembly fee. You get a free helmet of your
&gt; choice (that they sell) with each new bike.

&gt; The Harley dealer is MSRP, but you'll end up with a windshield,
&gt; sissybar, and other stuff thrown in.

&gt; On customer appreciation...

&gt; The HKSY does not regularly hold customer-appreciation days (my son
&gt; bought a bike from them). I say &quot;regularly&quot; to give them the benefit
&gt; of the doubt that they may have in the past, but AFAIK, they have
&gt; never done it.

&gt; The Harley dealer periodically throws customer appreciation days. I
&gt; know at least 6 or 7 recent customers of the dealership and have seen
&gt; it advertised as well.

&gt; On servicing bikes...

&gt; The HKSY dealer will not service you right away; they make you wait
&gt; for a few days. If you bought the bike from them, they do their best
&gt; to do the work while you wait. That's the one bennie they offer - fast
&gt; turnaround on service if you buy from them; new or used. Additionally,
&gt; they will not service a bike that is 10 years older or more unless you
&gt; bought it form them.

&gt; The harley dealer treats you like you bought the bike from them no
&gt; matter where your harley came from. While there's no service-while-u-
&gt; wait deal, you don't wait any longer than anybody else. Not sure on
&gt; the age aspect, though, since the folks I know hve bikes no mroe than
&gt; 10 years old.

&gt; Greg
">

You also won't notice the better HD service when you are FAR away from
home. I crashed out my Buell on the Blue Ridge Parkway a few years
back. I was able to ride it to the dealer. They gave me a ride to the
nearest hotel and had me back on the road the next day after 4 hours
in the shop and taking parts off a showroom bike. Another trip I
needed a rear tire bad and I was back on the road in 2 hours.

I have never had that kind of service from a metric dealer. Most of
those dealers are motorcycle/snowmobile/lawn tractor/chainsaw, etc
dealers (around here, at least). I have had more middle of the road-
less than happy dealings with metric dealers than HD. Most of the time
I have to wait for parts when having a metric serviced.

I wasn't all that happy with my Buell's valve guide seal that HD
wouldn't warranty without a bunch of runaround. They wanted to somehow
&quot;prove&quot; the bike was really using 1 quart every 1k miles. The dealer
just said screw it, replaced it, and told the rep he was going to
cover it and warranty the work. Never heard boo about it and the bike
hasn't had to be cracked open since.

For me, the HD dealer employees &quot;get it&quot; and know where their
customers are coming from. I actually had a metric dealer say &quot;you
didn't buy that here, did you?&quot; to which he promptly saw the back of
my shirt as I walked out the door.

&gt;&gt; Old bikes are cool - cheap to insure, cheap to license (can go with

&gt;&gt; As I consider which way to go with my next bike, Harley looks like the
&gt;&gt; winner to me, not considering the bike itself. As for the bike, a road
&gt;&gt; King is looking real good to me.

&gt; I just love my RK. Although Glendale Harley has really nice guys working
&gt; there and does everything you say, their service SUCKS! I'll make an
&gt; appointment for some work, which takes almost two weeks. Then, even though I
&gt; had an appointment, the bike will sit in the shop for another two weeks,
&gt; after I make my appointment. And, you can almost count on parts (bling, the
&gt; stuff you like). missing when I pick the bike up. Or an oil leak from the
&gt; filter or drain after an oil change. Sometimes they just leave the spilled
&gt; oil on the bike so it looks like it leaks, after it's service. Really nice
&gt; guys though, hot dogs and Harley Girls on weekends, test rides (if they know
&gt; you mean business) good prices and everything. The finance manager has great
&gt; tits, as well.
&gt; The sales manager stayed at the dealership until late at night to sell me my
&gt; V-Rod. But the service SUCKS. Yet, I bought a service contract with my
&gt; V-Rod, as it will save me almost 3K over the 20,000 miles of it's life. The
&gt; V-Rod servicing is expensive.

&gt; Trying to escape the carelessness of Glendale, I had Van Nuys Harley
&gt; Davidson put a set of Vance and Hines True Duals on the bike. It ran so
&gt; poorly, after I picked it up, that I thought I had put so much hot rod shit
&gt; on it that I thought I had ruined it.

&gt;  I eventually came to my senses and called Rudy at Las Vegas Harley Davidson
&gt; and trucked the bike up there.

&gt; On one Saturday, without any fanfare, LVHD righted the King and turned it
&gt; into an amazing performer (for a Harley). They had previously done major
&gt; engine work for me, in ONE Saturday, so I could take the bike home on
&gt; Sunday. This included (but not at the same time) a six speed screaming eagle
&gt; transmission, S&amp;S 510 cams with a 95&quot; big bore kit. Unfortunately,
&gt; sometimes, Vegas trips cost me big money, as I love to play Blackjack.

&gt; So if there's any real problem with the Harleys it's that their underpowered
&gt; (on purpose) and some of the So.Cal. Dealer service sucks.

&gt; I won't go into my horror stories with Bartels.

&gt; Any hot rod shit you'll want to add can't be performed by a California
&gt; dealership. You have to go to an independent (not recommended) or out of
&gt; state.

&gt; I'm not trying to knock Harley, here. As I've got horror stories from my
&gt; dealings with BMW dealer service as well. And I'm sure the Japanese riders
&gt; here have their own stories.

&gt; &gt; &gt;2. Harley shop
&gt; &gt; &gt;- may let you test ride, if they know you're planning to walk out with
&gt; &gt; &gt;a bike

&gt; &gt;         Not much point in 'test riding' what you've already decided to
&gt; &gt; take home, eh ?

&gt; &gt;         What do they do it you come in, test ride, and then tell them
&gt; &gt; you need to go check out some other brands, you'll be back if you're
&gt; &gt; still interested.  Then you come back a week later and say you want to
&gt; &gt; test ride something else ?

&gt; &gt; &gt;- sponsors rides left and right

&gt; &gt;         Which costs them somewhere between nothing and lunch money.

&gt; &gt; &gt;On presale service...

&gt; &gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer does not have presale service and they won't invent
&gt; &gt; &gt;for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt;The Harley dealer has presale service for $1900 for life, including

&gt; &gt;         Say WHAT ?  On average, how long to you keep a bike, Greg ?
&gt; &gt; Seems like maybe ~ 3 months.  The dealer figures anyone who buys that,
&gt; &gt; on average, will be selling or trading the bike within a year or two
&gt; &gt; anyway.  Or at least 8 out of 10 will.

&gt; &gt; &gt;maintenance items like oil changes, which they will do every 2500 mi
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead of the recommended 5K mi. State inspections are also included.

&gt; &gt;         Costs them nothing to tell the mechanic to slap a sticker on
&gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Tire repair/replacement is prorated based on how much tire life is
&gt; &gt; &gt;left.

&gt; &gt; &gt;On selling new bikes...

&gt; &gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer sells for MSRP+; the plus is a $249 service fee and up
&gt; &gt; &gt;to $800 for a n new bike assembly fee.

&gt; &gt;         Wow - they come disassembled, like a bicycle ?  I didn't know
&gt; &gt; that !  ( &lt;/sarcasm&gt; ).  Or is that for adding farkles that A ) you
&gt; &gt; pay through the ASS for their limited selection, and B ) takes their
&gt; &gt; mechanic an hour to throw on ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; You get a free helmet of your
&gt; &gt; &gt;choice (that they sell) with each new bike.

&gt; &gt;         Wow. $ 25 discount right there ! :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt;The Harley dealer is MSRP, but you'll end up with a windshield,
&gt; &gt; &gt;sissybar, and other stuff thrown in.

&gt; &gt; &gt;On customer appreciation...

&gt; &gt; &gt;The HKSY does not regularly hold customer-appreciation days (my son
&gt; &gt; &gt;bought a bike from them). I say &quot;regularly&quot; to give them the benefit
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the doubt that they may have in the past, but AFAIK, they have
&gt; &gt; &gt;never done it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;The Harley dealer periodically throws customer appreciation days. I
&gt; &gt; &gt;know at least 6 or 7 recent customers of the dealership and have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt;it advertised as well.

&gt; &gt;         CAD's = 'sales promotions' at ANY business.

&gt; &gt; &gt;On servicing bikes...

&gt; &gt; &gt;The HKSY dealer will not service you right away; they make you wait
&gt; &gt; &gt;for a few days. If you bought the bike from them, they do their best
&gt; &gt; &gt;to do the work while you wait. That's the one bennie they offer - fast
&gt; &gt; &gt;turnaround on service if you buy from them; new or used. Additionally,

&gt; &gt;         Makes business sense.

&gt; &gt; &gt;they will not service a bike that is 10 years older or more unless you
&gt; &gt; &gt;bought it form them.

&gt; &gt; &gt;The harley dealer treats you like you bought the bike from them no
&gt; &gt; &gt;matter where your harley came from. While there's no service-while-u-
&gt; &gt; &gt;wait deal, you don't wait any longer than anybody else.

&gt; &gt;         So, you get no benefit from being their customer on that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure on
&gt; &gt; &gt;the age aspect, though, since the folks I know hve bikes no mroe than
&gt; &gt; &gt;10 years old.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Greg

&gt; &gt;         It sounds like you're on the verge of falling for the 'Harley
&gt; &gt; Family' mystique.

&gt; Knowing I could go to Chatanooga and pick up a new (prev yr) X1800 for
&gt; 4-6K less than this dealership would sell for, but knowing that
&gt; factory mtc would be a PITA because of my local shop's stance on &quot;did
&gt; you buy the bike from us&quot;, I'm no longer considering only Honda for my
&gt; next bike.

&gt; The older I get, the less time I have to spend on tings and the more
&gt; important good service becomes. I keep all my home appliances under a
&gt; replacement warranty where I pay for just the warranty - even up to
&gt; the point of replacement. So, if I paid $19000 for a Harley and paid
&gt; $1900 for worry-free mtc - some, maybe most of which is honored at any
&gt; Harley dealership, I'm miles ahead.

&gt; As for how long I keep a bike... My next bike may be down the road a
&gt; piece, but if the opportunity arises, I wanna be ready :)-

Keep in mind that if you do buy a Road-King (or any other H-D), you
don't have to buy *any* accesories if you don't want to. The trick is
to not buy one of the showroom bikes. Order the *exact* bike you want,
and when it arrives, insist on paying MSRP, not a nickel more. You may
have to wait a bit for it, but at least you're not overpaying on
accesories you may or may not want (or need). You can save tons of
money this way. Dealers don't like it much and they may try and talk
you out of it, but unless one of the showroom bikes is exactly what
you want, insist on a factory order. They'll may not like it, but
they'll get over it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No surprise.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a LOT you don't know.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And youself, homecheese.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless, of couse, you know every fucking thing.  Which you may
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe, but which I doubt.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And if you think a dealer should get $ 800 on top of MSRP for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assembling the product he sells into a rideable state, you're a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complete fucking asshole.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which you may be anyway, for all I know.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   Actually , Bob's a nice guy . I met him last spring when we rode to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; northwestern Tennessee for  a partay . Hi Bob !
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   And where have you ridden lately to meet anyone from this (or any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other) list ?

&gt; &gt;&gt; NICE GUY????? WTF?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Howyadoing?

&gt; &gt;Getting over a late summer cold . Last week was miserable , this week
&gt; &gt;doesn't look like it's going to be much better .
&gt; &gt;  But this too shall pass ...

&gt; Got a travelling hangover.
&gt; Too many trips.

&gt; Tennessee
&gt; Sioux City
&gt; Calgary
&gt; Flew to LA and drove home a Mazda Miata for a friend
&gt; Drove with the wife to Niagara Falls, Montreal, Quebec and back
