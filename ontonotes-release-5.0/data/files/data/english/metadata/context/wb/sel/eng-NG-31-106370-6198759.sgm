That's tantamount to what he's doing.   It's a freaking disgrace that
these animals might get away with murder.   A 17-year-old was murdered
in cold blood in a dark field, and the goddamn animal who did this to
him might escape freaking punishment.   It's a goddamn outrage.
Nobody was protecting the rights of an innocent young victim, and now
this judge might spit on his grave basically saying that this young man
deserved to be murdered.   If Robinson is allowed to live than this
judge is showing total disregard for the Tornblom family.

No one is getting away with murder.  The judge refused to permit executions
until the state follows its own laws regrading procedures.

Hmmm.  Perhaps you're a troll.  The judge said nothing about the victim,
and his murderer remains on death row.

It's the judge's job to make sure that state officials follow the law.
Prison officials failed to do so by changing execution procedures without
getting requisite approvals.  The judge said they had to abide by state law
before they proceeded.

It's the judge's job to care that the law is faithfully enforced.  This
protects all of us.  It's not the judge's job to slake your need for
vengeance as quickly as possible.  In any case, it seems to me that your
outrage is misdirected:  why aren't you angry at the prison officials who
failed to follow the law?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If there were justice, then the state could revive the victim.  But as
you pointed out, the victim remains dead.  He can never receive justice,
and is past caring.  What you mean is that the state didn't extract
retribution quickly enough for you.

Too bad.  The rest of us are safer when judges require that prison
officials follow the law.  If that requires that you wait a few months to
see the state kill a convict, I think that's a fair trade.

I'm *very* pro-death penalty, but if the state wants to take someone's
life, they better do it according to laws that ensure all constitutional
and statutory safeguards were followed.

Besides, it would be a delay for pending death row cases, not a
commutation of sentences.

The article linked doesn't say that.  The execution might not
occur, but that only means that one aspect of the punishment may not
happen.  It does not mean anyone is getting away with murder.
Heck, Williams was sentence, and is serving life for the
crime.  If the execution order is overturned, then Robinson will spend
the rest of his life in prison.

If true, I would agree.  Since the article you've cited
doesn't make such a claim, I can't.

There is NOTHING in the article than can be reasonably
interpreted to mean what you claim.

If the execution would violate the law, then the judge would
be in the right to, at the very least, order a stay of execution.

Damn it Larry!  We're agreeing far too often! :)
I'm *technically* pro-death penalty.  The only reason I'm not
*really* pro is because innocent people do get convicted of crimes.
And there is no way to undo a death sentence, once carried out, if it
is later found that the convicted was innocent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's always a *possibility* of the sentence being commuted,
until the final appeal is done.  Even if by some strange quirk of fate
this should happen in Robinson's case, it doesn't mean justice hasn't
been done, as Bill has implied.
