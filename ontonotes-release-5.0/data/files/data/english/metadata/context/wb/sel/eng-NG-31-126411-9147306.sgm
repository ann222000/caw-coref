Hi Ive got an Nvidea 7900 GS or something like that and am getting graphics
artifacts in most of my games. In Civ 3 they are 3d pillars reaching up from
the ground up to infinity. In Medieval Total War 2 they are long thin
horizontal bars that seem to eminate from the trees in the campaign map (but
there arent any artifacts in the battles that I have noticed).  I have
noticed the computer crash on occasion when left for a long time paused in a
game. In Silent Hunter 4 they are shards coming from the submarine itself
and sometimes the ships. I havent noticed anything in other games like
Halflife 2 though. They seem to occur after a few hours play when perhaps
the card is getting hot? If I shut down the game and go back into it they
have diappeared and remain away for another half an hour or so. Perhaps the
computer is just not cooling enough although its a modern AMD dual core 4800
with loads of fans around. Or vcould it be the card is taxing the computer
power supply?  Its very strange I cant remember anything happening with my
original Radeon 1700 card that came with the machine.

I actually seem to remember things like this happening with my old computer
in Rome Total War and Civ 3 with another Nvidia card ages ago but then I
changed to a Radeon and it seemed to sort the problem (I think) I certainly
didnt have any problems with Civ 3 or Silent Hunter 3 with my old computer
which good cooling but a top of the range Radeon X600 card which must have
been rather taxing on the system.

Is it something that others have experienced with just Nvidea cards??

Or has anyone with a Radeon card experienced similar problems??

What is the cause of these artifacts??

Any help appreciated.

&quot;Hi Ive got an Nvidea 7900 GS or something like that &quot;

you have a £100 + video card. or something?

cooling would seem to be the issue, solutions include
add 3rd party cooler by zalman or similar,
remove a side from the case
as above, and point a desk fan into the opening

or, as it's almost certainly still under warranty, rtb!

I have a GTX 7900 and have played Civ 3 Conquest (the expansion pack) a lot,
and non of the issue's that you mention.

What driver version do you have ?

Try removing the driver completely and then reinstall the latest driver if
that don't fix it then something else must be causing it.

Weird problem you describe...

Maybe try updating the game.

Bye,
Skybuck.

Try the following. It fixes graphical artifacts on some machines.
Especially those with older motherboards with certain chipsets. -&gt;

Right click desktop
Properties
Settings Tab
Advanced Button
Troubleshoot Tab
Uncheck 'Enable Write Combining'
Reboot and try your games again.

Shards with Civ3, really? Civ3 is a pure 2D app, with Civ4 this makes sense.
Otherwise i had the same probs(the shards, some tiny, others blanking the
whole screen) with a 6800gt with any drivers except those on the
installation CD, i think those were the first ones able to recognize the
card, without employing its special features, very outdated.
The simple(and only) solution was to set AGP to 4x. I had tried EVERYTHING
else before that, as my mobo didn´t have that option in BIOS, and it had
been removed from the driver properties, so i finally came upon RivaTuner.
Rivatuner, BTW, will no longer run under Vista x64 with one of the
optional/recommended patches from August installed, as that enforces driver
signature checking irrevocably.

I actually thought he meant Civ 4 for the reason you stated. Civ 3 is
entirely 2d.

My own motherboard is 4x only and I still had the artifacts. Only
solution for me was the one I posted. It works for others so I figured
the original poster should try it first since it probably requires the
least amount of effort.

Insufficient hard data.

Give full computer hardware specs (MB, CPU, memory etc, etc),
including the output current ratings for the power-supply.

Usual suspects for this sort of problem after some heat-up time.

* Insufficient airflow on or around the 7900GS. Make sure that the
fan-rotation is not inhibited by accumulated lint.

* Marginal power-supply. Shows up after upgrading a pre-packaged PC
with higher-performance components and forgetting to address the
updated power-supply requirements.

Its an AMD 4800 Dual Core 2.4 processor computer with 1.5Gb memory, usual
300? mhz powerunit, massive harddisk. Its generally a quite modern made up
computer from Watford Electronics (Aries type) so it should be preforming
better than this. It came with a Radeon 1700 card which was performing ok
but was too slow so I upgraded it to a better card. But Ive also had
problems with my USB connections. I cant have my MS FF2 joystick connected
and access my broadband connection at the same time but I guess thats
unrelated to the problem with my graphics corruption in games. It generally
happens after the games have been playing for an hour or more and sometimes
my computer has crashed out completely. But Ive looked at my card
temperature and it doesnt seem to be getting higher than about 60-70 degrees
although it cools down quickly as soon as I stop playing a game. My house
doesnt have very good electrics I know becuase Ive lost two clock radios
(same make) for some reason (the ones that automatically tune themselves in
and auto set their times etc). My own guess would be as yours either
overheating or power related. I think I will try it with the case off to
see. I do have a cooling card around somewhere I could try but its noisy
thats the problem.

Sorry that should have been Civ 4 by the way - is one of the games Im
getting pillars rising from the ground to infinity - not Civ 3.

I have noticed it now in MTW2 (horiz pillars), MTW2 Kingdoms (horiz
pillars), Silent Hunter 4 (horiz shards)  and Civ 4 (vert pillars). I havent
noticed it in Enemy Engaged 2 yet but the 3d missions are quickly over in
that game. It seems to be the strategy games where the 3d graphics are on
screen for ages that seem to cause the most problems for me.
