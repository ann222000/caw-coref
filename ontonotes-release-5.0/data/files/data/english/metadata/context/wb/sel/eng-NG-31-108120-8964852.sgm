How to Unplug/Eject Memory Card in Win XP?

I have a Sandisk Extreme card reader permanently plugged into my Windows XP
PC.  Whenever I want to download images from my camera I insert the SD card
but XP does not seem to see it.  I need to unplug the USB cable and reinsert
it.  Ditto if I 'stop' the device.
Is there a better way than this?

But that doesn't solve the problem of how to get XP to notice that
you've plugged the card back into the reader at some later time.

So far, the only way I've discovered to do that is to unplug the reader
from the USB port and plug it back in, just as the original poster is
doing.

You'd think there would be another way ...

Yes, sadly that's the way Sandisk have implemented it. I
have other (slower) readers that inform Windows when cards
are inserted and removed, but not my Sandisk Extreme. It's a
damned fast reader but it has its irritating little foibles.

Not sure if it will help, but did you try going to &quot;My Computer&quot; and then
opening the proper entry in &quot;Devices with removable storage&quot;?
Also, mabye a newsgroup for Windows XP might be a better place to ask.

Yeah, that's the way I usually do it as well. However I do wonder if it is
necessary with XP, as occasionally when I just pull the card out it seems to
be OK. Of course if you do that while the card is reading you are asking for
trouble, just like when you turn off your camera before it has a chance to
put the files into the card. Does anybody know if you really have to shut
off the cardreader to just remove a card? My next step is usually to format
the card after that anyway.

I always just pulled my card reader/MP3 player/portable drive out of the
USB slot with no ill effects for years. Then the day before a
trans-Atlantic flight, I must've disconnected my MP3 player with a file
open, corrupted the directory, and I couldn't play anything on it. I
reformatted it, and it's been working without any problem for over two
months again. Since then, I always right-click in Explorer and choose
&quot;Remove Safely.&quot;

If your reader supports this, open up My Computer and right click on the

Yes, that is the lesson to take home!

Most people do not realize this and assume that Windows somehow can

One has to do this in Windows as well as in Linux (and in Mac too I guess).

I don't have a problem ejecting or stopping; just getting Windows XP to

Nope.If you disconnect the card reader *itself*, then you have to use remove
safely, or whatever it is in English.If you just pull off the card off the
reader, when transferring activity has ceased, you get no windows warning
message, so I presume it's safe.BTW, if you disable/disconnect the card
reader, you have to reconnect it, to make it working again.I suppose the
reader's internal circuitry has something that allows you to remove a card
live.

Do you go to &quot;My computer&quot;to find the card reader as removable

There's no need for this, IMHO if you just pull the card off.If you connect

I think that data transfer depends on the OS. The OS deals with how/when
to actually sync the mounted partitions. So, it is possible the desktop
GUI may show that the transfer is complete but it may take a bit longer
for everything to wrap up actually at hardware level (IIRC, file
deletions are a case in point). The &quot;remove safely&quot; option just ensures
there are no loose thread. It is never advisable to just yank out a
memory card from a reader -- you may get away with it most of the times,
but it can result in severe data loss once in a while.

I have a Nameless Firewire reader that responded well to that routine;
for months on end it saw the next card inserted and acted
appropriately. Then one of the Windows UpScrewUpdates must have done
something stupid. Since then, &quot;Eject&quot; will leave a sensitive reader
for a while, but later on it requires the Firewire cable be
unplugged/plugged.

Just thinking: perhaps I haven't been patient enough. Windows is set
to turn off drives after an hour; could it be the readers are slow to
respond to awakening? Next time I'll wait longer before unplugging.

My Sandisk Extreme doesn't seem to behave that way at all. I can remove and
replace the card with no problem. Sometimes the computer notices right away
and sometimes not. But when it doesn't, and I try to do something with a file,
it simply tells me to insert a card. (Actually I guess it's &quot;insert a disk&quot;.)

Full disclosure: My computer is Windows Server 2003, not XP. But I strongly
suspect they use the same driver. When I have a little more time (I'm trying
to finish up a couple of things before the World Series Game starts), I'll try
it on my XP laptop.

Generally, if you leave the card reader plugged in, you don't stop the
device as that will require you to unplug and replug it for XP to
recognize it.  I just take the card out, and put another one in.  It
takes XP some time to recognize this has happened, and I don't know any
way to make it see the new card faster.

ONLY if you want to remove the device, physically, NOT just the card.
It is safer to repeat the process, however, with removable readers, but
if you do that with a built-in card reader, you will need to reboot to
get it to work again!

To set up the card reader etc for fast removal in XP, go to My Computer,
right click on the relevant drive, and select Properties.

Select the Hardware tab, select the relevant drive (again), click on the
Properties button, then the Policies tab. Tick the Optimise for quick
removal option.

No need to to use the safely remove hardware thing again.

Actually, there is another way, and it's apparently been there forever
and I never noticed it 'til somebody in this thread mentioned the
&quot;Eject&quot; selection in some context menu or another.

In File Explorer, if you right-click the drive letter for the slot
corresponding to the individual memory card in your multi-card reader,
there will be an &quot;Eject&quot; entry. If you click that, the card will be
unmounted, but the card reader will remain.

If you re-insert the card, or insert another card, it will be
recognized, eliminating the need to unplug the reader from the USB port
and plug it back in again.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the way I usually do it as well. However I do wonder if it
is
&gt; &gt;&gt; necessary with XP, as occasionally when I just pull the card out it
seems
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; be OK. Of course if you do that while the card is reading you are
asking
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; trouble, just like when you turn off your camera before it has a chance
to
&gt; &gt;&gt; put the files into the card. Does anybody know if you really have to
shut
&gt; &gt;&gt; off the cardreader to just remove a card? My next step is usually to
&gt; &gt; format
&gt; &gt;&gt; the card after that anyway.

&gt; &gt; Nope.If you disconnect the card reader *itself*, then you have to use
remove
&gt; &gt; safely, or whatever it is in English.If you just pull off the card off
the
&gt; &gt; reader, when transferring activity has ceased, you get no windows
warning

&gt; I think that data transfer depends on the OS. The OS deals with how/when
&gt; to actually sync the mounted partitions. So, it is possible the desktop
&gt; GUI may show that the transfer is complete but it may take a bit longer
&gt; for everything to wrap up actually at hardware level (IIRC, file
&gt; deletions are a case in point). The &quot;remove safely&quot; option just ensures
&gt; there are no loose thread. It is never advisable to just yank out a
&gt; memory card from a reader -- you may get away with it most of the times,
&gt; but it can result in severe data loss once in a while.

My card reader has an &quot;access&quot;LED-I suppose when this goes off it's safe to
pull the card off.I had no problems with CF cards so far.(Since the card
reader is always plugged in a USB port I have never used remove safely
before).It's a sweex 12 euros card reader.

Yeah, and forget about the good practice of doing so and screw up the

This method will work on your own personal computer, but chances of
fscking up the memory card at another computer are still the same.

With my usual card reader, I can leave the reader plugged in and insert
a card, and the system WILL see the card, but it won't detect it and pop
up whatever import wizard (Adobe Photo Importer, Windows Photo And
Scanner Wizard, etc.) - I just have to open the appropriate drive in
Explorer, or press the &quot;Copy&quot; button on the reader.  If I plug a card
into the slots in my AiO though, the autostart kicks right in.

This is a function of the card reader, informing Windows that a new card
has been inserted. Solution: try a different card reader.

Agreed - the &quot;remove safely&quot; function essentially just flushes the cache
for that device before dismounting it.  With earlier versions of
Windows, data would be held in cache until you &quot;ejected&quot; the device,
unless you changed the cache behaviour with &quot;optimize for quick
removal&quot;; with XP (and I assume Vista), the default is for &quot;quick
removal&quot;, so the cache is always flushed to the device (assuming, of
course, you wait until it's actually finished copying).

No, you don't.  The &quot;eject safely&quot; in previous versions of Windows was
primarily to flush the write cache for the device; as of XP, the default
is to &quot;optimize for quick removal&quot; which always flushes the cache when
it's done writing.

&gt; Generally, if you leave the card reader plugged in, you don't stop the
&gt; device as that will require you to unplug and replug it for XP to
&gt; recognize it.  I just take the card out, and put another one in.  It
&gt; takes XP some time to recognize this has happened, and I don't know any
&gt; way to make it see the new card faster.
">

I think people are confusing Windows being able to READ the card, with
it actually detecting it's been changed and firing up the autorun
function (which normally launches the WIA wizard, Adobe importer, or
whatever autorun actions you have defined).

If you watch in Windows Explorer's My Computer view, you should see the
device's status update within seconds, whether you're plugging in just a
new card, or the whole reader; either way, it should be the same amount
of time.

The AUTORUN function, on the other hand, may not be triggered by SOME
READERS upon insertion of a new card.  Some readers WILL signal Windows
that new card has been inserted; some have a button on them that you can
use to trigger it.  When you plug in the reader, however, Windows will
ALWAYS (well, unless something else is wrong) detect that a new device
has been plugged in, and will initiate autorun as appropriate.

&gt; &gt;&gt; down in the lower left corner there is a little thing that says safely
&gt; &gt;&gt; remove devices or somethign click that and then select what you want
&gt; &gt;&gt; to eject

&gt; &gt; But that doesn't solve the problem of how to get XP to notice that
&gt; &gt; you've plugged the card back into the reader at some later time.

&gt; &gt; So far, the only way I've discovered to do that is to unplug the reader
&gt; &gt; from the USB port and plug it back in, just as the original poster is
&gt; &gt; doing.

&gt; &gt; You'd think there would be another way ...

&gt; Just put the card in, and WAIT.  It may take a minute or two for XP to

A MINUTE or two?  Maybe 5 seconds.

Selecting 'eject' also makes sure that any pending writes to the card
which might be waiting are executed immediately.  This will prevent loss
of data, but then so will waiting a few seconds...
