Richard the Third (Folio , )
.
Enter Richmond, *OXFORD* , Blunt, Herbert, and
others, with drum and colours.
.
Richm. Fellowes in Armes, and my most louing Frends
Bruis'd vnderneath the yoake of Tyranny,
Thus farre into the bowels of the Land,
Haue we marcht on without impediment;
And heere receiue we from our Father Stanley
Lines of faire comfort and encouragement:
.
*The wretched, bloody, and vsurping Boare*
(That spoyl'd your Summer Fields, and fruitfull Vines)
Swilles your warm blood like wash, &amp; makes his trough
In your embowel'd bosomes: *This foule Swine*
Is now euen in the Centry of this Isle,
Ne're to the Towne of Leicester, as we learne:
From Tamworth thither, is but one dayes march.
In Gods name cheerely on, couragious Friends,
To reape the Haruest of perpetuall peace,
By this one bloody tryall of sharpe Warre.
.
*OXF* : EUERy mans Conscience is a thousand men,
To fight against this guilty Homicide.
Her. I doubt not but his Friends will turne to vs.
.
Blunt. He hath no friends, but what are friends for fear,
Which in his deerest neede will flye from him.
.
Richm. All for our vantage, then in Gods name march,
TRUE Hope is swift, and flyes with Swallowes wings,
Kings it makes Gods, and meaner creatures Kings.
.
Exeunt Omnes.
----------------------------------------
Henry the Sixth, Part Three (Quarto , 1595)
.
Enter king Lewis and the ladie Bona, and Queene
Margaret, Prince Edward, and *OXFORD*
and others.
.
War. Iniurious Margaret.
.
Prince Ed. And why not Queene?
.
War. Because thy father Henry did vsurpe, h
And thou no more art Prince then shee is Queene.
.
*OX* : Then Warwike disanuls great Iohn of Gaunt,
That did subdue the greatest part of Spaine,
And after Iohn of Gaunt wise Henry the fourth,
Whose wisedome was a mirrour to the world.
And after this wise prince Henry the fift,
Who with his prowesse conquered all France,
From these our Henries lineallie discent.
.
War. *OXFORD* , how haps that in this smooth discourse
You told not how Henry the sixt had lost
All that Henry the fift had gotten.
Me thinkes these peeres of France should smile at that,
But for the rest you tell a pettigree
Of threescore and two yeares a sillie time,
To make prescription for a kingdomes worth.
.
*OXF* : Why Warwike, canst thou denie thy king,
Whom thou obeyedst thirtie and eight yeeres,
The Tragedie of Richard D. of
And bewray thy treasons with a blush?
.
War. Can *OXFORD* that did EUER fence the right,
Now buckler falshood with a pettigree?
For shame leaue Henry and call Edward king.
.
*OXF* : Call him my king by whom mine elder
Brother the Lord Aubray *VERE* was done to death,
And more than so, my father euen in the
Downefall of his mellowed yeares,
When age did call him to the dore of death?
No Warwike no, whilst life vpholds this arme,
This arme vpholds the house of Lancaster.
.
War. And I the house of Yorke.
K Lewes. Queene Margaret, prince Edward and
*OXFORD* , vouchsafe to forbeare a while,
Till I doe talke a word with Warwike.
Now Warwike euen vpon thy honor tell me TRUE;
Is Edward lawfull king or no?
For I were loath to linke with him, that is not lawful heir.
.
War. Thereon I pawne mine honour and my credit.
------------------------------------------------
*OXF* : I like it well that our faire Queene and mistresse,
Smiles at her newes when Warwike frets as his.
.
P. Ed. And marke how Lewes stamps as he were nettled.
.
Lew. Now Margaret &amp; Warwike, what are your news?
-----------------------------------------
Enter Warwike and *OXFORD* , with souldiers.

War. Trust me my Lords all hitherto goes well,
The common people by numbers swarme to vs,
But see where Sommerset and Clarence comes,
Speake suddenlie my Lords, are we all friends?

Cla. Feare not that my Lord.

War. Then gentle Clarence welcome vnto Warwike.
And welcome Summerset, I hold it cowardise,
To rest mistrustfull where a noble hart,
Hath pawnde an open hand in signe of loue,
Else might I thinke that Clarence Edwards brother,
Were but a fained friend to our proceedings,
But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shal be thine.
And now what rests but in nights couerture,
Thy brother being careleslie encampt,
His souldiers lurking in the towne about,
And but attended by a simple guarde,
We maie surprise and take him at our pleasure,
Our skouts haue found the aduenture verie easie,
Then crie king Henry with resolued mindes,
And breake we presentlie into his tent.

Cla. Why then lets on our waie in silent sort,
For Warwike and his friends God and saint George.

War. This is his tent, and see where his guard doth
Stand, Courage my souldiers, now or nEUER,
But follow me now, and Edward shall be ours.

All. A Warwike, a Warwike.

Alarmes, and Gloster and Hastings flies.

*OXF* : Who goes there?

War. Richard and Hastings letcthem go, heere is the
Duke.
-------------------------------------------
Mair. TRUTH my Lord, we know you for no lesse.
EdwI craue nothing but my Dukedome.

Rich. But when the *FOX* hath gotten in his head,
Heele quicklie make the bodie follow after.
-----------------------------------
Enter VVarwike and Clarence, with the Crowne, and
then king Henry, and *OXFORD* , and Summerset,
and the yong Earle of Richmond.

*OXF* : Tis best to looke to this betimes,
For if this fire doe kindle any further,
It will be hard for vs to quench it out.

War. In Warwike shire I haue TRUE harted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in warre,
Them will I muster vp, and thou sonne Clarence shalt
In Essex, Suffolke, Norfolke, and in Kent,
Stir vp the knights and gentlemen to come with thee.
And thou brother Montague, in Leister shire,
Buckingham and Northampton shire shalt finde,
Men well inclinde to doe what thou commands,
And thou braue *OXFORD* wondrous well belou'd,
Shalt in thy countries muster vp thy friends.
My soueraigne with his louing Citizens,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Faire Lords take leaue and stand not to replie,
Farewell my soueraigne.

King. Farewel my Hector, my Troyes TRUE hope.

War. Farewell sweet Lords, lets meet at Couentrie.

All. Agreed.

Exeunt Omnes.
------------------------------------
Enter Warwike on the walles.

War. Where is the post that came from valiant *OXFORD*?
How farre hence is thy Lord my honest fellow?

*OXF* post. By this at Daintrie marching hitherward.

War. Where is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?

Post. I left him at Donsmore with his troopes.

War. Say Summerfield where is my louing son?
And by thy gesse, how farre is Clarence hence?

Sommer. At Southham my Lord I left him with
His force, and doe expect him two houres hence.

War. Then *OXFORD* is at hand, I heare his drum.
Enter Edward and his power.

Glo. See brother, where the surly Warwike mans the wal.

War. O vnbid spight, is spotfull Edward come!
Where slept our scouts or how are they seduste,
That we could haue no newes of their repaire?

Edw. Now Warwike wilt thou be sorrie for thy faults,
And call Edward king and he will pardon thee.

War. Naie rather wilt thou draw thy forces backe?
Confesse who set thee vp and puld thee downe?
Call Warwike patron and be penitent,
And thou shalt still remaine the Duke of Yorke.

Glo. I had thought at least he would haue said the king.
Or did he make the iest against his will.

War. Twas Warwike gaue the kingdome to thy brother.

Edw. Why then tis mine, if but by Warwikes gift.

War. I but thou art no Atlas for so great a waight,
And weakling, Warwike takes his gift againe,
Henry is my king, Warwike his subiect.

Edw. I prethe gallant Warwike tell me this,
What is the bodie when the head is off?

Glo. Alasse that Warwike had no more foresight,
But whilst he sought to steale the singleten,
The king was finelie fingerd from the decke?
You left poore Henry in the Bishops pallace,
And ten to one you'le meet him in the Tower.

Edw. Tis euen so, and yet you are olde Warwike still.

War. O cheerefull colours, see where *OXFORD* comes.

Enter *OXFORD* with drum and souldiers &amp; al crie,
*OXF* : *OXFORD* , *OXFORD* , for Lancaster.

Exit.
--------------------------
Enter *OXFORD* and Summerset.

*OXF* : Ah Warwike, Warwike, cheere vp thy selfe and liue,
For yet thears hope enough to win the daie.
Our warlike Queene with troopes is come from France,
And at South-hampton landed all hir traine,
And mightst thou liue then would we nEUER flie.

War. Whie then I would not flie, nor haue I now,
But Hercules himselfe must yeeld to ods,
For manie wounds receiu'd, and manie moe repaid,
Hath robd my strong knit sinews of their strength,
And spite of spites needes must I yeeld to death.

Som. Thy brother Montague hath breathd his last,
And at the pangs of death I heard him crie
And
Yorke, and Henrie the Sixt.
And saie, commend me to my valiant brother,
And more he would haue spoke and more he said,
Which sounded like a clamor in a vault,
That could not be distinguisht for the sound,
And so the valiant Montague gaue vp the ghost.

War. What is pompe, rule, raigne, but earth and dust?
And liue we how we can, yet die we must.
Sweet rest his soule, flie Lords and saue your selues,
For Warwike bids you all farewell to meet in Heauen,
He dies.

*OXF* : Come noble Summerset, lets take our horse,
And cause retrait be sounded through the campe,
That all our friends that yet remaine aliue,
Maie be awarn'd and saue themselues by flight.
That done, with them weele post vnto the Queene,
And once more trie our fortune in the field.

Ex. ambo.

Enter Edward, Clarence, Gloster, with souldiers.

Edw. Thus still our fortune giues vs victorie,
And girts our temples with triumphant ioies
The bigboond traytor Warwike hath breathde his last,
And heauen this daie hath smilde vpon vs all,
But in this cleere and brightsome daie,
I see a blacke suspitious cloud appeare
That will encounter with our glorious sunne
Before he gaine his easefull westerne beames,
I mean those powers which the Queen hath got in Frace
Are landed, and meane once more to menace vs.

Glo. *OXFORD* and Summerset are fled to hir,
And tis likelie if she haue time to breath,
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

Edw. We are aduertisde by our louing friends,
That they doe hold their course towards Townburie.
Thither will we for willingnes rids waie,
And in EUERie countie as we passe along,
Our strengthes shall be augmented.
Come lets goe for if we slacke this faire
Bright Summers daie, sharpe winters
Showers will marre our hope for haie.

Ex. Omnes.

Enter the Queene, Prince Edward *OXFORD* and Sum-
merset, with drum and souldiers.

Quee. Welcome to England, my louing friends of Frace,
And welcome Summerset, and *OXFORD* too.
Once more haue we spread our sailes abroad,
And though our tackling be almost consumde,
And Warwike as our maine mast ouerthrowne,
Yet warlike Lords raise you that sturdie post,
That beares the sailes to bring vs vnto rest,
And Ned and I as willing Pilots should
For once with carefull mindes guide on the sterne,
To beare vs through that dangerous gulfe
That heretofore hath swallowed vp our friends.

Prince. And if there be, as God forbid there should,
Amongst vs a timorous or fearefull man,
Let him depart before the battels ioine,
Least he in time of need intise another,
And so withdraw the souldiers harts from vs,
I will not stand aloofe and bid you fight,
But with my sword presse in the thickest thronges,
And single Edward from his strongest guard,
And hand to hand enforce him for to yeeld,
Or leaue my bodie as witnesse of my thoughts.

*OXF* : Women and children of so high resolue,
And Warriors faint, why twere perpetuall
Shame? Oh braue yong Prince, thy
Noble grandfather doth liue againe in thee,
Long maiest thou liue to beare his image,
And to renew his glories.

Sum. And he that turnes and flies when such do fight,
Let him to bed, and like the Owle by daie
Be hist, and wondered at if he arise.

Enter a Messenger.

Mes. My Lords, Duke Edward with a mighty power,
Is marching hitherwards to fight with you.

*OXF* : I thought it was his pollicie, to take vs vnprouided,
But here will we stand and fight it to the death.
Enter king Edward, Cla. Glo. Hast. and Souldiers.

Edw. See brothers, yonder standscthe thornie wood,
Which by Gods assistance and your prowesse,
Shall with our swords yer night be cleane cut downe.

Queen. Lords, Knights &amp; gentlemen, what I should say,
My teares gainesaie, for as you see, I drinke
The water of mine eies. Then no more
But this. Henry your king is prisoner
In the tower, his land and all our friends
Are quite distrest, and yonder standes
The Wolfe that makes all this,
Then on Gods name Lords togither cry saint George.
All. Saint George for Lancaster.
Alarmes to the battel, Yorke flies, then the chambers be
discharged. Then enter the king, Cla &amp; Glo. &amp; the rest,
&amp; make a great shout, and crie, for Yorke, for Yorke, and
then the Queene is taken, &amp; the prince, &amp; *OXF* : &amp; Sum.
and then sound and enter all againe.

Edw. Lo here a period of tumultuous broiles,
Awaie with *OXFORD* to Hames castell straight,
For Summerset off with his guiltie head.
Awaie I will not heare them speake.

*OXF* : For my part Ile not trouble thee with words.

Exit *OXFORD* :

Sum. Nor I, but stoope with patience to my death.

Exit Sum.
