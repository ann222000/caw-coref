It Ain't That Pretty, That Life of Zevon's

By JANET MASLIN

I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon.
ByCrystal Zevon.

Illustrated. 452 pp. Ecco. $26.95.

One self-imposed epitaph Warren Zevon delivered after learning he had
terminal cancer was this: "It's a damned hard way to make a living,
having to die to get 'em to know you're alive." Like so much of what
he said, wrote and sang, it was quotable, savagely funny and true.

Near the end of his life (he died at 56 on Sept. 7, 2003), doing some
of his best work in the face of adversity, Mr. Zevon remained stuck
in a commercial vacuum. The great promise of his sensational early
albums had never brought him the wide following he deserved. So he
decided to make the most of a terrible situation, advising his
manager to exploit his illness in any way that might advance a soon-
to-be-over career. (The manager refused. Still, there were posthumous
Grammys.) And he called upon his estranged wife, Crystal Zevon, to
take care of him. He also wanted her to take notes.

Ms. Zevon fulfills his wishes with "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead," a no-
holds-barred oral history that captures a lovable but wildly aberrant
personality, draws upon a fascinatingly diverse cast of characters
and peers into the heart of the Los Angeles singer-songwriter
community in its prime. The widow's role is awkward, given her ex-
husband's gun-toting rages, heavy substance abuse, iffy parenting and
unflagging ability to chase new women. She also uses an awkward
format that has her writing in both the first person (as speaker) and
third (as editor). And she takes for granted readers' familiarity
with the music of her lifelong companion. (This book has no index or
discography.)

But her affection, candor and dogged pursuit of information make this
book an unforgettable journey into the depths of Mr. Zevon's mad
genius. There is much for Ms. Zevon to balk at, but she has the
temerity for this tough job. The rare thing for which she apologizes
is not having tried to interview Bob Dylan, one of many stellar
musicians who had a way of turning up at Zevon recording sessions,
given the high regard in which fellow artists held him. "I guess I
was just scared," she says.

"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" uses Zevon song titles like "Werewolves of
London," "Detox Mansion," "Mr. Bad Example" and "My Dirty Life and
Times" as chapter headings. It doesn't use the one that best sums up
this story: "Ain't That Pretty at All." The Mr. Zevon on these pages
is surprisingly image-conscious, abusive, petty, jealous, sordid,
vain, shopaholic and even banal; among his obsessive-compulsive tics
was buying the same kind of gray T-shirt over and over again. His
diary entries often focus on such things, so they are less
scintillating than the literary lyrics for which he is known. Among
the livelier entries is this one: "Went over to Ryan's. Later in the
evening I got stuck in the elevator - Fire Dept. had to come. Not as
much fun as it sounds."

But this lack of show-business artifice is precisely what makes the
Zevon story so telling. What was even more unusual than his dark
thoughts - like resenting the fact that Jackson Browne and Neil Young
had lost people close to them and written beautiful, much-admired
songs about those deaths - was his willingness to admit to those
thoughts. On his deathbed, discussing the merits of having a funeral,
he said, "I just don't want to have to spend my last days wondering
whether Henley" - Don Henley of the Eagles, who did not attend
- "will show up."

Mr. Browne is one of many mentors who tried to help Mr. Zevon,
knowing that their wild-man compatriot was his own worst enemy. "My
role as benefactor took its toll on our friendship," Mr. Browne says
astutely, but it was a friendship that endured to the end of Mr.
Zevon's days. Mr. Browne also points out that when he introduced Mr.
Zevon to an audience as "the Ernest Hemingway of the twelve-string
guitar," Mr. Zevon said he was more like Charles Bronson. "Warren
didn't have literary pretensions," Mr. Browne says. "He had literary
muscle."

He also had literary tastes (he was the rare rock musician who went
looking for bookstores while on the road) and literary antecedents
(he is aptly compared here to Dorothy Parker and, by Bruce
Springsteen, to Nathanael West). And he had literary cronies, some of
whom he met by showing up at their book signings. "He was more self-
deprecating about his talent than we were about ours, and we
genuinely stink," Dave Barry says about the Rock Bottom Remainders,
the all-author band with which Mr. Zevon sometimes played.

"I don't think his fires were out, but I think he'd banked his
fires," says another band member, Stephen King, who knew Mr. Zevon
during the singer's middle and later years.

Most of his friends from this period had no idea of the wreckage
caused by Mr. Zevon's early alcoholism. After years of hair-raising
benders (many of them described in the book), he became sober for 17
years, only to be thrown off the wagon by a diagnosis of certain
death. These last megabinges shamed Mr. Zevon and angered some of his
new friends. "I said the one thing this guy should not do is die a
clich√©," says the writer Carl Hiaasen, who worried that Mr. Zevon's
two children would have to read about their father's fatal drug
overdose in a newspaper. But they didn't. And he had three months to
get acquainted with twin grandsons.

The Zevon legacy, which will be greatly bolstered by this intimate
portrait despite the warts it reveals, also carries on in other ways.
In his diary, Mr. Zevon reported meeting a yuppie family who called
their dog Zevon. With classic Zevon acerbity, he told them, "I don't
think this is what grandfather had in mind."
