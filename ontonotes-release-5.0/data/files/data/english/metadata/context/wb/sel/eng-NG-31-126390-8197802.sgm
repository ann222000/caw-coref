Hard drive non accessible in current Powerbook unit

Hello,

I have an Apple Powerbook 15&quot; Ti. It has completely died a death, that
is to say, the unit will not start up under any circumstances
whatsoever.

I cannot get a response on the screen, nor a response by connecting it
to another Mac using Firewire. The only indication of some life in it
is the green light that comes on when it is connected by electricity
at the power-point plug on the back right-hand side.

Meanwhile, is there any way that I can remove the hard drive and
reconnect it directly to another device so to access the data and info
on it?
What is possible and what kind of cabling is recommended for this type
of DIY surgery?

I'm a thousand miles from an authorised Apple dealer so I need to do
the operation myself.

Hoping you can help and advise.

Kind regards,

Paul

I've done this before, and it's not that difficult. Make sure you have
the RIGHT SCREWDRIVERS before you begin. DAMHIKT.

See
&lt; http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/powerbook_g4/PB_G4_HD_upgrade/pb_g4_hd_upgra
de.html&gt; to remove the drive.

Then you need an ATA external case that will take a 2.5&quot; drive. See

All the green light really tells you is that the battery is charged, it
doesn't have anything to do with whether the rest of the Mac is working.

Before giving up on the Mac, try resetting the power manager-- see
&lt; http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449 &gt; for instructions.

First of all, have you tried Firewire target disk mode?  Press the power
button while holding down the &quot;t&quot; and wait for a minute.  If it's
working, in a minute you'll see a Firewire logo (a yellow Y-shaped
thing) on the Mac's screen.  When this is working, the laptop acts like
a Firewire hard drive, so all you need do to rescue data is plug it into
another Mac's Firewire port.  That'd require a Firewire 400 cable.

If that doesn't work, getting the hard drive out of a TiBook is actually
not very hard.  Turn it over, a few screws, and you're done.  Check this
site for illustrated instructions: &lt; http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac/ &gt;.

Once the drive is out, you can't just plug it into another Mac as-is
unless you have another laptop you can transplant it into.  You can
convert it into an external drive, though, and use it most anywhere.
I'd put it in an external Firewire case.  OWC has some nice models that
will fit the TiBook's hard drive (and that come with cables)-- see
&lt; http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/on-the-go &gt; and look for the
&quot;add your own HD&quot; options.  They also have illustrated guides for
installing the drive in the enclosure.

One option is to get an ATA Firewire / USB adapter like this one.  That
way you don't need a case or enclosure.  You just hook up the drive and
go:

Pretty slick.

You don't &quot;need&quot; an enclosure with that.  But you'll pay more to avoid
it.  The FW 400 (plus USB2) drive dock lists for $99.95; a comparable
enclosure from OWC would be $64.99.  If you want FW 800 the difference
is dramatic-- $169.95 for the drive dock vs. only $79.99 for a
comparable model from OWC.

Is there some kind of advantage to the drive dock that justifies the
higher price?  From that page it looks not only more expensive but also
much less useful, being as the drive dock leaves the drive exposed while
an enclosure would at least protect it.

That *IS* slick. I like Weibetech's products and have one of their
firewire cases. I didn't know they made those things.

I can see a definite advantage for a tech department, for instance if
you were imaging drives for installation.

The big advantages I see with it is it's simple, quick, and compact.
