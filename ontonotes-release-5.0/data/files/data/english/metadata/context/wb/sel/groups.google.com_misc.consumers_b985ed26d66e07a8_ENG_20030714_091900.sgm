I recently got ripped off by a high-volume half.com/E-Bay seller bearing the
moniker &quot;texasbook&quot;. Apparently, I am not alone; within the past few weeks this
seller has been getting many, many, many negative feedback entries. (the
running totals to date are 887 negative and 537 neutral, as against 3228
positives). Everyone tells the same story: never received the item, the guy
ignores e-mail inquiries. (He seems to still be alive; a small minority do seem
to be getting grudging refunds out of him, and a few are even receiving the
items they paid for.)

The dollar figure in question is only about $13, and I filed a claim with
half.com and will presumably receive a refund, but I'm wondering whether anyone
has ever successfully instigated prosecution of one of these recidivist thieves.
After all, if he has ripped off 800+ people, perhaps to the tune of $10 on
average per person, he has stolen (or attempted to steal, depending on to what
extent half.com keeps reimbursing him) $8000. I don't know how it works down in
Texas, but 'round these parts, if I were to steal $8000, or even attempt to do
so, I'd be looking at a jail sentence.

So what does it take to get the sheriff to show up at this guy's door? It's a
long shot, as I'm not sure E-Bay provides a means to find out his address, but
has anyone tried this? Surely this guy isn't the first crook ever to darken
E-Bay's door.

"/> You shouldn't jump to any conclusions, at least not yet.

According to eBay's records they've been registered since
July 2002, and maintained a decent selling record (not perfect
by any stretch, but still ok) through the first part of June 2003.
It appears something drastic happened and they started
cancelling orders.

If it was outright fraud eBay would have pulled the plug on
them a long time ago. So I'd say wait a week or two and
see if eBay sends you any more information.

So why did you buy from someone with clost to 900 negatvies?
My bet is its either someone who just went belly up, lost a suppler or
more likely someone who account has been compromised

Losing a supplier or going belly up is no excuse for their ignoring my e-mail
and refusing to issue a refund. They took my money and sent no product. That's
theft, plain and simple.
