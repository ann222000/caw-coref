Received a cuisinart food processor for a wedding gift, a 7 cup model (came
with a second mini food processor as well).

http://www.cuisinart.com/catalog/product.php?product_id=30&amp;item;_id=59...

I've only had it 3 days but so far made a nice cheese dip and used to it
fine chop cabbage for chinese dumplings :-)

Is it worth my time in effort to grind my own meat with it?  I was thinking
a coarser grind would be nicer compared to the usual store bought ground
meats for many dishes. Does anyone here do this regularly and can comment or
offer advice?  I don't envision buying a proper meat grinder anytime soon.

How well does it work for bread kneading?  Better to do by hand?  Same for
for pasta.  I *love* home made pasta and I do not have a pasta maker.   I
usualy do it by hand every couple weeks and roll it out myself.   Is it
possible to use this machine to mix my pasta for me or am I hoping for too
much?  Rolling is the easy part IMHO, mixing is the annoying part :-)

It does not say anything about pasta at all, that was a prayer :-)   It has
a bread dough attachment but the things I've read online are sort of hit and
miss.  Some like, some don't but don't say why.   I've never made bread.
Have you ever ground meat in yours?

This is secondhand, but according to Julia Child, a meat grinder works
better because you do not end up with chopped gristle in the meat.
Instead, the gristle stays in the screen of the grinder, where
you can manually remove it from time to time.

They say that grinding meat, the meat will be mushy.  I've tried it, too; it
is mushy.

Bread kneading -- very good - Quite good.
There are many cookbooks written which include in the bread recipes: By
Hand, By Mixer, By Food Processor.

Bob has a Cuisinart food processor as well. Just this last week we
wanted to attempt a small batch of pasta dough to run through a
little, manual Atlas Mercato pasta maker that I brought into the
marriage, but have never used. It was an unsual experiment, to say the
least. We have the big KitchenAid mixer (two, actually) that we have
always done dough in, but thought for this smaller quantity we would
try the Cuisinart.

Not sure if it was the flour or the processor or technique, but we
could never get the dough right. We even tried different blades. The
thickness of the pasta strips were inconsistent, and had small holes
and tears as we worked it. Just need to stick with our fail-safe
KitchenAid next time.

That makes sense.  I would probably take care to properly cut out any
gristle and such first though.

Is it mushy even for a coarse grind?  I wouldn't try and replicate a proper
sausage meat grind style, but something a little chunkier.  I like chunkier
for chili and stroganoff.

I have ground meat once with my Cuisinart Custom 11.   The attachment
comes with two grinding plates - coarse and finer.   I used boneless
chuck, cut into strips, and had no problems using the coarser plate.   A
second grind would have been beneficial, though.

You can spend a lot more but I bought this Waring as a step up from my
slightly smaller Moulinex  and it works great:

I think if you shop around you can find it for less, I paid $160 two

Try this
http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_10214...

Here is the episode number, but I just don't remember how to use it.
Episode EA1B11  The benefit of being able to read the episode is that I
believe he elaborates further on using the food processor for chopping meat.
Maybe someone else can help with finding the episode?

The only time I grind meat is to use for stuffing pasta like ravioli

I looked at the website, and you can order a dough blade for that

&gt;Sheldon, I'll probably give this a go and if it does not satisfy my needs I
&gt;may end up doing so.  Suggestions for brand names and models? I don't want
&gt;to sacrifice an early retirement on one but I would want one that lasts for
&gt;life.

Jeez, I've never agreed with Sheldon before, but he's right about this. 8;(

Food processors shred the meed rather than extruding it. Two important points:
you need to first chill the meat and cut the meet into 3/4 or 1 inch cubes, then
pulse it in the processor, and you will get something usable for burgers, meat
loaf, and such.

However, a meat grinder is far, far better. The meat grinder attachment for
Kitchen Aid mixers does fine, but something much beefier (NPI) with standard
grinder plates is better yet. Avoid the common WalMart / Target names like Rival
-- their toys are not nearly as capable as others available for the same price.

Two excellent sources are:

http://www.pleasanthillgrain.com/meat_grinders_food.aspx (scroll past the
commercial grinders to the bottom of the page for the Maverick ($99.95) and
Back-to-Basics ($89.95) grinders).

and http://www.sausagemaker.com/ (the TSM-8 at $99.95, as well as a great
selection of grinder plates and parts).

These or similar grinders are often available on eBay, but -- shipping
considered -- no better buys, in my experience.

I have the Maverick, with an extra coarse plate for making chili, and I'm very
happy with it. I do at least ten pounds at a time, and it doesn't break a sweat.
Much better than the KA attachment I used before.

I agree - a FP and meat grinder give different results, but the FP can
be better for some things, such as shredding meat for chili.

A FP is great at kneading dough. I use the slicing/grating disks a lot,
too.

Only cooked meat, like leftover ham or turkey for ham salad or turkey
croquettes, but I've done those with my KitchenAid mixer's grinding
attachment.

I'd think using the FP might make something more like a meat paste,
but maybe your FP has slower speeds.  I've got kind of an old Hamilton
Beach one that has one speed.

You can buy a hand grinder - the kind like grandma used to clamp onto
the edge of the kitchen table.  They work great; they're easy to
clean, and there's nothing that ever breaks, really.

Lehmans is a great source for old-fashioned, reliable stuff - and
grinding meat isn't so hard, even for me.  The one I have is probably
at least 75 years old - and there's nothing wrong with it at all.

Be careful (nowadays?) buying a hand-grinder for grinding meat.  I bought
one maybe 7 years ago, and it didn't last but one or two grindings before
the finish (was it tinned?) came off in tiny pieces.  I wasn't even grinding
meat with it.  It wasn't exactly cheap, either, maybe $80 at that time.   I
learned my lesson buying something while traveling; I never returned it, so
I'm still a little ticked.

Thrify/charity shops are great resources for old fashioned tools like these.
I have a bunch of things that the modern equivalents were crappy, but the
old ones work on... and on...

Like anything else hand grinders are made in many quality levels, you
get what you pay for.  A quality hand grinder costs just as much as a
quality electric grinder... in fact there are kits available for
converting a quality hand grinder to motorized.

I don't recommend a hand grinder, they don't work nearly as well as a
motorized grinder, the results are not very good because it's near
impossible to maintain constant speed for more than about a minute,
they are slow, and probably won't get used very much if at all because
they require a lot of muscle... most people employ a helper, one
grinds one feeds... there are lots of accidents... never have a helper
when using any grinder, in fact no one else should be in the kitchen,
meat grinders require ones full attention.  Hand meat grinders were
once very popular with hunters because they had no electricity at
their lodge, it was plenty cold so they needed no electricity for
refrigeration but they had no choice about the grinder, now they have
lightweight portable generators.   Serious hunters don't bring back
the entire animal, they dress, butcher out the prime sections and
grind the remainder... they come home with a manageable sized
package.  I have two long time friends I worked with for over 25 years
who at least once a year go elk hunting in Alaska, they're flown in
and picked up ten days later.  They need to butcher the meat and leave
all the scrap because of weight limitations with those small planes.
There's more involved with rules about sharing with the natives but
that's the gist of it.

It wasn't all that many years ago that people had no electricity in
their homes either, so hand meat grinders were used.   My grand
parents used hand grinders, they cooked with wood and coal, they had
no electric, they used gas lights, and an ice box because a gas fridge
was too costly... and this was in NYC... my parents had a gas stove
but still we had an icebox until I was ten years old, we heated with
coal too.  But these days most everyone takes electric for granted,
anyone who is desirous of a hand grinder instead of electric is merely
on a nostalgia trip... you'll use it once and relagate it to the
basement.   I can just see yoose finding a place to clamp it where it
won't damage your fancy schmancy furniture... oh, it'll fit nicely on
the end of your granite counter (crack).  People can afford mega bucks
designer kitchens and all sorts of expensive appliances but can't
scrape up the few bucks for a decent meat grinder.

You can buy a pretty good little electric meat grinder for home use
for $100, but for a few dollars more you can get one the next size up
that works far better.  Not a week goes by I don't use my meat grinder
for something other than grinding meat so it's not money spent on
something that sits around collecting dust.  A meat grinder does many
common kitchen chores with much better results than with a food
processor... the beauty of a meat grinder is that everything passes
through the business end just once, nothing can get over processed...
you have total control over the grind from beginning to end, every bit
comes out with the exact same consistancy.

You can't grind meat with a food processor, anyone says they can is
fooling themself... in fact you can't grind anything with a food
processor, not any meats, not nuts, not bread crumbs, nothing... a
meat grinder even does a better job of grating hard vegetables;
potatoes, carrots, onions, etc.

I like my new Waring Pro for many reasons, one being it's taller than
typical home grinders, with my old smaller grinder there was always a
problem with finding a large bowl that was also low enough to fit.
Most times I had to use a platter to catch whatever I was grinding and
then tranfer to a mixing bowl, just created something else to clean...
not a big thing but with the taller grinder I have many more choices
of what to use to catch food plus it's just generally a more
comfortable work height.  Of course with the larger grinding head the
grind is a much nicer consistancy... with smaller grinding heads
there's more back pressure, which creates smearing.  Even with larger
grinders if you want a finer grind it's usually more preferable to
grind twice than to use a plate with smaller holes.

I'm convinced it's psychological, people are truly embarassed for
anyone to know they need to grind their own meat because they can't
afford the so-called luxury of store ground... there is no other
logical explanation for why people are so adverse to owning a meat
grinder, other than that they are so obstinate that their stubborness
can't be other than construed as a psychological illness.

There is nothing that says a screen has to a fine wire mesh that you put
over your windows to keep our the bugs.  The whiles in a screen can be
several inches in diameter and it is still screen.  They use screens with
with openings a foot or more across in quarries to sort gravel by size.
They have huge openings, but they are still screens.

Methinks that someone was just being anal, and that is a bad thing to be

I would like to add to this that unless you are a heavy duty user, you
can likely find one that will suit you at a thrift shop, flea market,
garage sale or estate sale.  I have two, both purchased used this way.
They don't appear every day, it takes a little patience and persistence,
but $2 for a meat grinder compared to $80 or more is a worthy price
difference to make the patience worthwhile.

To screen means tp prevent passage... grinder plates do just the
opposite, they enable passage, the edges of those perforations are the
complementary part of the cutting blade, the other half of the
shearing mechanism... minus the grinder plate would be tantamount to
scissors with only one blade.  Without the grinding plate the grinder
won't grind, it would cease to be a grinder.  A meat grinder is a very
well engineered tool, there are no wasted parts, all its five parts
are necessary; the body, the auger, the plate, the blade, and the
retaining nut.   Meat grinder web sites refer to grinder cutting
plates, not screens.

Yes, they can be. But a screen is a right angle interwoven mesh of
constant-diameter or constant-width linear elements, whereas an extrusion plate
for a meat grinder is simply a disk with round holes drilled in it.

It is not a screen. You're just being obtuse.

That page contains two mentions of the word screen:

For a Tyler &quot;Sanitary Grinder/Finisher&quot;: &quot;Tyler 2-1/2 in. mesh screen.&quot;

Note the word &quot;mesh,&quot; and the fact that the &quot;mesh screen&quot; is in cylindrical form
-- it is not a flat extrusion plate. This mutha also has a 25 HP motor, and is
not intended for grinding meat.

And for a 60-gallon hammer mill, which is rather obviously not a home meat
grinder.

Neither one has anything to do with the subject under discussion. We're
discussing the correctness of referring to a meast grinder's thick, rigid
extrusion plate as a screen (generally synonymous in this context with sieve).

All grinders are equally easy to clean.

Years ago people used to buy that type of grinder for their young kids
so they could help mommy cook... many, many of those kids amputated
their fingers. That's a toy r us sized grinder, of exceptionally poor
quality and extremely dangerous... and the better made version they
show is still quite crappy, just as dngerous, and costs almost as much
as a larger sized motorized modern grinder.  Not all Lehman's products
are very good, and many, because they're old fashioned, are very
unsafe.  A quality hand operated grinder (that actually works) can be
quite expensive for what it is, in modern times a hand grinder is more
of a conversation piece.  Chop Rite makes what is considered the last
of the quality hand grinders... a home kitchen sized model (at least a
#12... a #22 is better) will run about $200, and it's still a hand
grinder.  The kind that clamp to a table suck, they keep loosening and
they ruin tables, they wobble and that makes them even more unsafe
than they already are... the four point mount versions are much easier
to attach adn much more stable... you screw it to a sturdy board and
then clamp the board to a table with at least two C clamps.  Some
folks who happen to have a Chop Rite grinder motorize it, but they are
very dangerous... all hand grinders are dangerous because the hopper
is so shallow and they have no meat tray... very easy to amputate
fingers... with hand cranked versions your fingers will be gone in
less than 1/3 a rotastion, you won't feel a thing until it's too late,
with a motorized version before you realize it'll probably take your
entire hand and you arm halfway to your elbow.... they do sell an
extention but by the time you buy the grinder, the motorizing kit, the
motor, and the safety extension you've paid more than the price of a
very powerful modern electric grinder, and then the drive belt
arrangement is extremely dangerous.

I advise anyone contemplating a meat grinder to buy a modern motorized
type, they're as safe as any motorized kitchen appliance and safer
than most, a stand mixer is much more dangerous... do NOT even think
about a hand crank type grinder.
