The three digital photos were taken seconds apart using a Kodak
Easyshare CX7430.  Does anyone have an explanation for the anonmaly
that is developing in the first two prints and cluminates into a
wispy apparition in the third close up.   Click on the last three
photos.  They are of higher resolution.

Any imput would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

You're kidding, right?

Well in case you're not, you shot the picture with a flash and you had
a WAY too long shutter speed.  You then moved the camera before the
shutter closed.  The flash lit up the dark areas and stopped all
motion because of the strobing effect, but the bright areas continued
to be exposed and therefore show the movement.

For the last picture, it was a sweeping motion.

For the second-to-last it was a downward motion.  Look at the bright
reflection of the tire and you can trace the motion.

Two ID's?  I'm unaware of that.  The the naysayers on Sci.astro are at
a loss for explaining this anomally.  Can anyone in this group
determine if the photos were tampered with?
Or is this going to be approached the same way as in Sci.astro?

I did not take the photos, my niece did.  If you know anything about
the camera,  its point and shoot fully automatic.

For the last picture you say it was a sweeping motion?  The photos
were not taken using a tripod so there can be some movement associated
with the photos but nothing to accont for the  image revealed in the
third photo. Please explain to me the light spliting at the top and
the varing intensity of the wispy image. Light does not bend.  You
responded within second of my post.  You obviously need a second look.

PS If that is your explanation can you reproduce the same effect?

Nothing to do with paranormal but rather with poor photography skills. Pat
explained it quite nicely.

For further discussion at the very least post the original photo without any
PS-ing or down sizing to a ridiculous 336x448 pixels such that we can look
at the original EXIF data, in particular camera data, shutter speed, and
flash data.

The orignal data was transferred to computer and then e-mailed to me.
It is no longer in the camera's memory.  Does this put us at an
impass?  I suspect that if you know your stuff you should be able to
tell if the images have been tampered with.   Yes/No  or once again,
not enough data.

No need to tamper with those photos. For all we can tell the photographer
made a rather stupid but quite typical beginners mistake which resulted in
those blurry/slurred window and tire highlights. Nothing special/remarkable
about it at all.

For further evaluation we need the original photo, not some cropped-down
miniture version with all relevant information stripped.

Easily. Any P&amp;S camera on fully automatic (or any camera set for slow-sync flash
modes) will expose for existing light and then add in the flash to fill up the
shadows. During the time that the shutter is open at a SLOW shutter speed and
before the flash, your &quot;niece&quot; was moving the camera. Any brighter objects in
the image, the highlights from the tire rim, the window (as appears as your
&quot;ghostly&quot; sweep in the last image), were ALL caused by an idiot's camera shake.
(idiot = your niece, it must run in your genetic line, for you are proving to be
an even bigger idiot)

You are nothing but a moron hoping someone will justify your psychotic
imaginings. You also don't know one fucking thing about digital cameras and
photography in general. It's fools like you that waste the time of good people
in trying to explain something to a simpleton who won't take the truth and
reality for an answer. They insist it must be something more when the evidence
is staring them right in the face, evidence that someone already explained to
them but people like you are too fucking stupid to comprehend.

&gt; &gt; Most importantly everyone, why is the girl wearing clothes???

&gt; &gt; Couldn't help myself...       ;-)

&gt; Not just that, but &quot;poltergeist&quot; means &quot;noisy spirit&quot;, and these photos had
&gt; no sound.

Comedians... Reset, you looked upped poltergeist now thats a start.
Did you know that poltergeists are attracted to ground water ( under
ground springs throughout the property) and pubescent females.   James
what can I say, she's under age.  Don't tell me your one of them...
Watch out for Dateline.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The three digital photos were taken seconds apart using a Kodak
&gt; &gt; &gt; Easyshare CX7430.  Does anyone have an explanation for the anonmaly
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is developing in the first two prints and cluminates into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; wispy apparition in the third close up.   Click on the last three
&gt; &gt; &gt; photos.  They are of higher resolution.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any imput would be greatly appreciated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,
&gt; &gt; &gt; RT

&gt; &gt; You're kidding, right?

&gt; &gt; Well in case you're not, you shot the picture with a flash and you had
&gt; &gt; a WAY too long shutter speed.  You then moved the camera before the
&gt; &gt; shutter closed.  The flash lit up the dark areas and stopped all
&gt; &gt; motion because of the strobing effect, but the bright areas continued
&gt; &gt; to be exposed and therefore show the movement.

&gt; &gt; For the last picture, it was a sweeping motion.

&gt; &gt; For the second-to-last it was a downward motion.  Look at the bright
&gt; &gt; reflection of the tire and you can trace the motion.

&gt; I did not take the photos, my niece did.  If you know anything about
&gt; the camera,  its point and shoot fully automatic.

&gt; For the last picture you say it was a sweeping motion?  The photos
&gt; were not taken using a tripod so there can be some movement associated
&gt; with the photos but nothing to accont for the  image revealed in the
&gt; third photo. Please explain to me the light spliting at the top and
&gt; the varing intensity of the wispy image. Light does not bend.  You
&gt; responded within second of my post.  You obviously need a second look.

&gt; RT

&gt; PS If that is your explanation can you reproduce the same effect?
">

You have two basic questions:  Have the photos been tampered with and
can I the results be reproduced.  The answers are &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;.

No, I doubt that pictures have been tampered with.  They are just as
the pictures were recorded.

Can they be reproduced.  Yes, easily.  And then I can instantly stop
the effect.  Plus I can put the blur to either side of the object, at
my will.

Here is how you reproduce the image.  Go to a dimly lit place like a
shed with 1 farily bright thing in it.  Put your flash on your
camera.  Set you exposure to 5 seconds.  Trip the shutter as you are
moving around a bit, like moving the camera left to right because you
are talking to your model.  You will get exactly the same blur with
exactly the same good definition in the model.  Now, don't change any
of the setting on the camera, put it on a tripod, push the shutter and
walk away.  The effect will be gone.

I just googled a little.  Here is a similar result.  If you believe
your effect is ghosts, then this is a picture of the cars they use to
drive around in.

Here is the same effect with swans.  Either that, or it is swan-
ghosts.

Here's a ghost cab with a spooky white spot above it

Here's some ghost festival

Shall I go on?

Otherwise, someone will edit one of your pictures and can create the
effect in photoshop.  But no, I don't think your niece did it in PS.

Probably taken using the &quot;Night&quot; scene mode on the CX7430 and flash on
Auto.  Camera wasn't on a tripod.

&quot;Night scenes or low-light conditions. Place the camera on a flat,
steady surface or use a tripod. Due to slow shutter speeds, advise
people to stay still for a few seconds after flash fires.&quot;

So, camera on is on Night mode.  Photographer hits shutter, flash goes
off and puts relatively sharp imprint of close objects on sensor.
Shutter stays open, and camera moves.  Bright background objects get
imprinted as the lens moves, but dark foreground objects don't show up
as much.

Most higher-end cameras have a &quot;SLOW&quot; or &quot;SLOW2&quot; mode for their flash
that you can create similar effects.  &quot;SLOW&quot; means &quot;first curtain
flash&quot; where the flash freezes the action at the beginning of a longer
exposure.  &quot;SLOW2&quot; is the same, except it uses &quot;Second Curtain flash&quot;
to freeze the action at the end of a long exposure..  Here are a few
examples I made using SLOW or SLOW2 for creative effect:

These photos are single-exposures and undoctored (except perhaps for
some minor color/brightness tweaking).
