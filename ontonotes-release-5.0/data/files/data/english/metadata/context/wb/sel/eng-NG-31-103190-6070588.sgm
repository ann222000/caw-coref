Yersterday, I was at Fort Smallwood, which is on the point of a
headland sticking into Chesapeake Bay, at 7:00am.  It was 13 degrees
but with no wind, and a bright sun, which made it feel comfortable.
This morning it was warmer but you ahd a 35 mph wind blowing, which
was the leading edge of an Alberta clipper.  The small birds in the
marsh were laying low.  There were far fewer Scaup and Bufflehead than
the prior morning even thought he ice was gone.  But the birds there
were hugging the shore.  I sat in my car watching them dive, and as I
set the numbers grew.  Bunch after bunch came down the wind, sped over
low and turned back into teh wind to land with the others.  I was less
than 100 ft from the action and it was beautiful to watch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From where I sat, it is only about 40 ft to the water's edge, and that
">

space is filled with mowed grass.  After a bit a flock of canada geese
came in and landed just in front of me.  Bu then the unusual thing
happened.  There is a park bench right at the water's edge.  A bird I
couldn't instantly recognize came in and perched on the back of the
bench.  The angle of the light washed out the colors but I didn't
recognize the shape immediately.  Although only 40 ft away I put the
binocs on it and it turned out to be an American kestral. This is the
last place I'd expect to see one, even on a good day.  But then the
bird did something totally unexpected.  The face of the point is all
big boulders dumped to stop erosion.  The kestral flew down into the
boulders right by the water.  And though I sat there for another hour,
he never came out.

The only thing I can figure is that it's a bird migrating north.  The
wind was dead from the north and from that point he'd have to fly
across a couple of miles of open water.  So he ducked into the rocks
to rest and get out of the wind.

Canandaigua Lakes for the GBBC but there is so much ice and snow not much to
count mainly gulls and canadas and a few merganzers. JAkin Western NYS

I'm a native Central New Yorker.  Nine months a year I'm homsick for
the rolling green hills.  Three months a year I am not.  We are in the
middle of those three months.
