Those who do not study the past are condemned to relive it.

The house would get out of control and I would take over and clean it all.
I can only let a mess go so long then OCD kicks in...ugh!

My parents bought a budgie when I spent a few months at home
unemployed. Once he settled down, I would let him out to fly
around the house with me, and he turned out to be a brilliant mimic.
By the time I went back to uni, he had a whole list of things to say.
&quot;Who's a pretty boy?&quot;, &quot;Hello!&quot;,  &quot;I'll get you!&quot;, &quot;You little
bugger!&quot;,
&quot;No!&quot;, &quot;Cut that out!&quot; :-)

My father's galah barks! Both he and my sister have small,
yappy dogs. The galah climbs down to the bottom of the cage
and barks at them, and when they run up and bark back he
tries to peck their noses through the wire. :-)
