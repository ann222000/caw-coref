As most know Alex Ross's version of The Kingdom, the follow-up to
Kingdom Come, was going to be a bit different than the one co-creator
Mark Waid finally did.  First, he retconned the secret ID thing
immediately. He didn't feel that they would ever give up their secret
id's.  Secondly, that bomb that was dropped didn't just kill
characters you didn't know or cared about.  It killed a lot of
people.  It's that second one that I personally let go.  I've had
enough of death.  If there's one flaw in What If/Elseworlds (which is
what KC was originally) it's that every creator leaps to killing
characters merely because he can, unmindful that this leads to a lot
of depressing stories that no one wants to read.  So if Mark Waid
decided that, since Alex Ross wasn't around he wanted to keep pretty
much everyone alive despite the corpses shown, I forgive him.
Besides, while I thought the main plot of The Kingdom blew, I enjoyed
the individual issues of  Son of the Bat, Kid Flash, Nightstar,
Offspring and yes, even Planet Krypton and according to Ross many of
them were supposed to be dead.  End Spoiler space.

After the KC Superman arrives at JSA headquarters he says &quot;I watched
you die&quot; to the JSA meaning people in that room did die in the bomb
blast at the end of KC allowing co-writer Alex Ross to refute Mark
Waid's Kingdom work once and for all and if and when we go to Earth-22
(the Kingdom Come earth) it will probably be elaborated on even
further.

Other than that I really don't see any point to this.  I mean, why
have a KC crossover?  KC was such a finite story I can't believe
anyone wanted to make the first line of sequels.  If you'll notice,
the issues I enjoyed really didn't pursue themes so much as give us
closer looks at the characters that we only saw and who barely spoke.
I would have just as happy with a Who's Who in the KC or Secret
Origins: KC.  The only character who actually warrants a KC crossover
isn't even in the JSA:  Superman. He the lynchpin in all of it.  KC
Superman is a &quot;Ghost of Christmas&quot; future for the current Superman.
There's a story there (and it looks like we'll see it next issue) but
only there.

Oh, and I'll be very disappointed if no one notices that whenever Lois
Lane dies, Superman is willing to either destroy the world or let it
destroy itself.

Don't forget DC's inane decision that the alternate Earths &quot;resemble&quot;
those we've seen before.  So current DC policy is that Earth 22 is a
KC-type world.  It isn't the KC Elseworld that we read about (though
given that it mirrors KC so closely--as all the respective parallel
worlds seem to resemble their progenitors--I don't understand why they
don't just say &quot;yes this *is* the KC Earth).

This is exactly WHY any attempt to unify DC (or Marvel) with some Crisis
or Zero Hour or Captain Carrot Crisis will all come to naught.

At the very best:

You will have some writer/artist combo who will make a one shot which is
popular with the fans and then later the editors/publishers will try to
unify the story into continuity hoping to piggyback on the success.

At the worst:

You will have multiple alternate stories and one-shots made by inferior
artists/writers.  You will have a mish mash of vampire batmen, zombie
batmen, communist supermen and all around dreck which muddy the original
character. You will eventually need to talk to the owner of the Android
Dungeon in order to keep it straight. Earth 22?  Earth 616?  WTF!!!!!!!
Who cares!!

Personally, I would return to the Julie Schwartz or Stan Lee period
where you didn't really care if you had an out of character superhero in
an issue because that would be the &quot;dream&quot; issue.  It was a far simpler
world.

I didn't think it was clear whether PW died or not at the end of Kingdom

Yes, but in the GN she doesn't appear again while some of the others do.
Also, there was a list of the dead (somewhere) and she was on it. :(

I'd like to see a list like that.  Unless it came from TPTB, it could be
purely anecdotal, like &quot;anyone who wasn't specifically on-panel after the
explosion is presumed to be dead&quot;.

I wonder if E-22 Supes will remind New Earth Supes &amp; Bats of the guy who
boom-tubed into the Batcave and kicked their asses before being shot with a
K-bullet and fading away, back in issue #2 (?) of Superman-Batman.  Same
age, same outfit.

Actually it was *other* versions of him that died.  The Kingdom kicks
off when Magog gets to *our* KC Superman.  And it stupid from the
beginning because when Magog attacks KC Superman, all the heroes of
the world come to help, but strangely none of the duplicate heroes
from the *other* KC Supermen that he killed ever came after him.
Bad, bad story.  Sometimes even someone like Waid has a misfire.

No.  Earlier versions of him.

He killed the Post-KC Superman, then travelled back in time and killed
him a little earlier, etc, etc... thus fucking the one true timeline

No, the ending of the Kingdom was that Hypertime existed and thus there
were alternate realities despite what the Linear Men claimed. Thus
Kingdom Come still existed as a world but it could never be the future
of the, at the time, modern DC universe. Kingdom Come Superman, Batman
and Wonder Woman were all still alive.

&gt; No, the ending of the Kingdom was that Hypertime existed and thus there

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I was hoping for Power Girl meets Power Woman, but I guess if
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Waid's rewrite is out......PW died.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I didn't think it was clear whether PW died or not at the end of Kingdom
&gt; &gt;&gt; Come.  GL, the Ray, and Magog, and Supes were all at ground zero and
&gt; &gt;&gt; survived, and Power Woman is pretty tough.

&gt; &gt; Yes, but in the GN she doesn't appear again while some of the others do.
&gt; &gt; Also, there was a list of the dead (somewhere) and she was on it. :(

&gt; I'd like to see a list like that.  Unless it came from TPTB, it could be
&gt; purely anecdotal, like &quot;anyone who wasn't specifically on-panel after the
&gt; explosion is presumed to be dead&quot;.

&gt; I wonder if E-22 Supes will remind New Earth Supes &amp; Bats of the guy who
&gt; boom-tubed into the Batcave and kicked their asses before being shot with a
&gt; K-bullet and fading away, back in issue #2 (?) of Superman-Batman.  Same
&gt; age, same outfit.
">

Okay, a little internet search shows that Jess Nevins actually posted
the Waid &amp; Ross list of the dead:

&quot;Page 30 (188). The Waid/Ross Annotations list the dead as the
following: a Bat-Knight, Robotman III (&quot;liquid metal hardened into
stone), Black Mongul, Red Arrow, Red Hood, Black Canary III,
Oliver &amp; Dinah Queen, King Crimson, Alloy (&quot;mostly melted
away&quot;), Stealth II, Nuculoid, Superman (alive, obviously),
Catwoman II, Atom-Smasher, Aleea Strange, a Bat-Knight,
Creeper, 666, Phoebus (&quot;burned into the ground&quot;), Blue Beetle II,
Sandman IV, Blue Devil II, Bulletman II, Wildcat III, and Golden
Guardian.&quot;

It's light and sure as hell doesn't match all the bodies we see on the
ground, but Power Woman should still be alive as well as Flash's
daughter.  But damn, to wipe out Ollie and Dinah and their family
including Roy and his daughter?  That just sucks.  I missed that and
was happier in my ignorance.

I could have sworn that she was on the list of the dead; in fact, I believe

Well after seeing that Ollie and his whole freaking family dies,
you'll understand if I don't go looking for that list, right?  But
this sort of thing is what I once addressed in a post about What If
and Elseworlds.  Writers just jump to the dark side when they do them
and turn every story into the last act of Hamlet with the bodies of as
many heroes as they can fit on the ground.  To me, even in imaginary
stories killing people off is the sign of a limited imagination.

I read the wiki article on KC this AM, but didn't have time to post.  The
article states that PW was killed in the novel.  Maybe that is where I saw
the list.  So that doesn't mean she died in the comics, I guess.

I have the feeling that if our JSA goes to Earth-22, we are not going to see
PW.  PW was not KC Supes' cousin, was she?  I don't recall any origin being
given for her in the series, or was there?  Not having her appear means not
having to explain her.

And yeah, one reason I didn't read too many of the Elseworlds was because of
the darker tone.  Dark is fine, but bleak is too much for me.

Well, given Alex Ross has a hand in the plot, I think you're right.
He will give us a substantially higher body count.

But in the annotations at the end of the trade she is id'd as &quot;Power
Woman, formerly Power Girl&quot; so yeah, it is her, which makes it odder
that she wouldn't survive just as Superman did.  This is creator
conceit, wherein something that shouldn't happen happens to fulfill
the needs of the story.
