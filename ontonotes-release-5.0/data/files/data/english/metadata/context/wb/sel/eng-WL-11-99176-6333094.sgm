Well, it appears I owe Judith Miller an apology. All this time I thought she was a neocon supporter who did her best to slant the news to help grease the path of the invasion of Iraq, and now it appears she was just channelling Emily Litella . It's not that she has an agenda, she just doesn't take very good notes . "Valerie Flame"? "Victoria Wilson"? With note-taking like that, it's no wonder her reporting is so inaccurate.

Left I on the News can now exclusively reveal that Miller's original notes on WMD reporting grew out of a discussion with sources who were discussing Iraq's development of a new chemical weapon, a herbicide designed to eradicate moss in lawns . Unfortunately, Miller wrote "weapons of mass destruction" instead of "weapons of moss destruction" in her notes. Then, in a second conversation with another source, Miller was told about Saddam Hussein's devious plan to supply the poor of Iraq with free televisions to take their minds off the effects of the crippling American-led embargo which had killed more than a million of them. Intending to write "weapons of mass distraction," Miller's poor note-taking once again led her to write "weapons of mass destruction," and, well, you know the rest.

Soviet jewelry , anyone?

Thanks for that link on moss in lawns. I've printed it out. I think it will prove very helpful in reducing my lawn moss problem, particularly in choosing grass seed.

Hey, we aim to please here at Left I on the News ! Just make sure when you go to the store you ask for "weapons of moss destruction." Wouldn't want you to get in trouble!
