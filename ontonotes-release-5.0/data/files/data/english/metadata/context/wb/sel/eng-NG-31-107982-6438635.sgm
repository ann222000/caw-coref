Hello All

I am new to this discussion group and I am looking forward to making
all kinds of new friends here. I have been collecting for over 30 years
and have amassed quite a collection of odds and ends. Over the years I
have had quite an eclectic collection.
I have recently opened a store on Stamps Wants
www.stampwants.com/stores/stanlickstampexchange . I am slowing filling
up this store with my duplicates and everything else that I am not
collecting anymore. Feel free to stop by and see what is available.
I have also started a Stamp Search company.I have many clients that are
looking for hard to find stamps and have hired me to find these stamps
for them. I charge very little as I enjoy the search and enjoy the
feeling I get when I find a stamp for someone that they have been
looking for. I have found many stamps that clients have been looking
for over a number of years.
I look forward to hearing from all of you and look forward to the
discussions that follow.
Good day for now
Bob

Welcome Bob:

I'm sure that you will make many friends here.
You will find the group pretty friendly and they
range from beginners to long time collectors,
from novices to experts.

Most philatelic questions find an answer here.

One thing that I suggest is that you read the
Charter and the FAQ.  It is posted here every
week or two.

(copied below for your information)

Ads for TRADING are allowed in this newsgroup.
However ads for selling or buying are NOT permitted
in RCSD.

The group rec.collecting.stamps.marketplace (RCSM)
was set up specifically for ads for SELLING and BUYING.

Good Luck and have fun.

Blair

WELCOME to the rec.collecting.stamps.* newsgroups

Subject: WELCOME to the rec.collecting.stamps.* newsgroups

If you are a newcomer to the rec.collecting.stamps.* newsgroups, that
is,
to

rec.collecting.stamps.discuss
rec.collecting.stamps.marketplace

then welcome!  The rest of us here hope that you will enjoy the
discussions of stamps and stamp collecting, and take advantage of our
"virtual marketplace" for buying and selling stamps.

Although this posting focuses mainly on the r.c.s.* groups, you should
be
aware that there are other stamp-related groups, for example
rec.collecting.postal-history (for collectors of stamped and stampless
envelopes, postal cards, etc., as they relate to the development and
history of postal services) and alt.collecting.stamps (a
general-purpose
newsgroup about stamp collecting).

In order to use the r.c.s.* groups effectively, you should know
something
about their purposes and history.

rec.collecting.stamps.marketplace (r.c.s.m) is basically for
buy/sell
advertisements from stamp dealers and collectors

rec.collecting.stamps.discuss (r.c.s.d) is basically for
discussion-type postings, announcements, and requests for trading
partners for stamps.

You can find links to the "charters" for these groups, which define
what
kinds of postings are appropriate for them, at

http://web.presby.edu/~jtbell/usenet/rcs/

Please note that these two groups were created specifically to separate
"discussion" type postings from buy/sell advertisements.  Some people
are
particularly sensitive to ads in r.c.s.d, and if you post one there,
you
will likely receive e-mail about it.  Some responses may be less
tactful
about this than others.  If you posted an ad because you didn't know
about
the "rules", don't take these responses personally.  We all make
mistakes
once in a while.  Simply post your ads to r.c.s.m in the future, to
prevent this from happening again.

For general information about stamp collecting, see the "Collecting
Stamps
FAQ" at
