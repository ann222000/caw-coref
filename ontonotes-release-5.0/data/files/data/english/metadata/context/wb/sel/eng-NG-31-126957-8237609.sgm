The real conspiracy is how so many humans convinced themselves that they
actually cared that much about sugar water.

Didn't have aught else to bend their brains about, I guess.

And we're the ones supposed to be good at pulling the wool over our own
eyes.

This is why I have a visceral hatred for cola of all sorts.  I started
out just disliking the taste, then had to live through a half century of
cola ad campaigns.

I doubt if I've drunk more than two quarts of cola in my life, and it
was all by accident.  (Followed by spitting and often yelling.)

Holy shit, this stuff ACTUALLY HAPPENED?!?  People refusing to speak
with family members because THEY DARED NOT SUPPORT THE OLD COLA
REGIME?  A tiny minority of people, truly and deeply offended THAT
TIMES CHANGE, bullying everyone else to not support something they
ACTUALLY LIKE and instead force blind obeisance to something JUST
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THINGS USED TO BE?  What the holy living FUCK???

Yeah, I agree, this really is what the True Conspiracy looks like...
The kicker quotes for me were:

&quot;A psychiatrist Coke hired to listen in on phone calls to the company
hotline, 1-800-GET-COKE, told executives some people sounded as if
they were discussing the death of a family member.&quot;

AND

&quot;Bottlers, particularly in the South, were also tired of facing
personal opprobrium over the change. Many reported that some
acquaintances had stopped speaking to them, or had expressed
displeasure in other emotionally hurtful ways.&quot;  (Friends and family
REFUSED to talk to them OVER A FUCKING SOFT DRINK?!?!?)

AND

&quot;Given a chance to try all three in a blind test, New Coke slightly
edged out Pepsi - yet many drinkers reacted angrily to finding they
had chosen a brand other than their favorite.&quot;  (Reacted ANGRILY???
What the holy fuck???)

Thank you very much for this Zapanaz, as this really IS the best
possible example for the True Conspiracy, the one that people don't
even realize exists.  But I never really thought things were THIS
fucked up...

From early in the article (by the time I got to this part, I was
hooked):

' Coca-Cola's most senior executives commissioned the top-secret
&quot;Project Kansas&quot; ' (lol) ' ... to test and perfect the new flavor for
Coke

... tasters were asked if they would buy and drink it if it were
Coca-Cola. Most said yes, they would, although it would take some
getting used to.' (! ... 'I like it, but I will have to work at
actually drinking it') 'A small minority, about 10-12%, felt angry and
alienated at the very thought, saying that they might stop drinking
Coke altogether.' (!!! ... lol) 'Their presence in focus groups tended
to skew results in a more negative direction as they exerted indirect
peer pressure on other participants.[4] ' (!!!!)

Somehow they must have tapped into some backdoor that the Yeti put
into the human brain when we were engineering humans as a slave race.
Similar to the &quot;you're walking in the desert and you see a tortoise on
it's back&quot; thing in replicants.

The thing most don't realize about coke, pepsi and other brand names
is that these corporate egregores are fed by the billions of dollars
spent on market analysis and advertisement. Those few who reacted most
to the change were possesed the most, they had the weakest minds.
Every time you drink a pepsi, some where, and angel has his wings
ripped off by a soda shaped demon thingy and is then violently mouth
raped. An image which makes the sugar water appealing to me.
