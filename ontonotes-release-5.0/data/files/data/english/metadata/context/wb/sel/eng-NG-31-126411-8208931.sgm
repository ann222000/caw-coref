Nvidia G92 and G98 have problems

By Charlie Demerjian: Thursday 16 August 2007, 14:40

Nvidia has got G92 and G98 silicon back, end of good news.
The bad news? Well, all of the rest of it.

At the Displayport plugfest a couple of weeks ago, what may have been
the grand debut of G92 and G98 was not to be.

Nvidia abruptly left the festivities after only a day, instead of the
full two, some sources said this was because things were not going
'smoothly'.

http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=41739

granted it's just a rumor, but I don't recall rumors of Nvidia having
any major problems with a new GPU since the days of NV30 / GeForce
FX.

IF true, hopefully AMD-ATI will capitalize on any stumble by Nvidia.

Er, who cares whether G92 silicon has Displayport or not ? National
Inquirer does it again.... By the time anybody will really care about
this standard for which there is no hardware in the market, nVidia
should be on G11x silicon.....

Anyway, I gather from other more reliable sources that the next-gen
development is going pretty well. But, don't expect any new hardware
even in limited production before the end of 2007.... which has been
the projected release time for any of nVidia's next-gen for at least
the past 6 months.

Yes another of the alarmist postings from our resident Ati fanboy.
(You need to change your usenet moniker)

Seen the AMD stock price recently... slipping away? No doubt because
of the value dilution by the $1.5 billion Senior Notes floated by
AMD. Investment rating just above &quot;junk&quot;. One medium-term loan to
retire the loan that helped buy ATi  (The biggest mistake AMD ever
made.). No increase in working capital. Seems as if AMD/ATi is going
to have some trouble finding the money for a full ( Dx10.1?) GPU
hardware iteration. No doubt they will continue to amuse themselves
with sticking little peripheral bits on the 2xxx series, like
Displayport and making big noises about them.

John is blatantly a Nvidia fanboy. Nothing wrong with that, if that's
what floats your boat.

The irony being though that he quite regularly accuses other people of
being fanboys.

I've long had him down as king of the PKB.

If it would end the too-frequent idiot ramblings and superficial pablum
by this air-raid toolbox, I'm all for it. Like competition is really
doing the industry a whole hell of a lot of good right now.

I really don't see the point in your repetetive whinging about Nvidia
hardware which in any event is not available to purchase at this time. If
you dislike their future stuff so much, I suggest you fuck off into the
future and make your indignance known by NOT buying their components, and
stay the fuck out of the present, you fucking cock.

Regards,

Dr.White.

Ummm, actually no.

But no point in being an ostrich and indulging in wishful thinking.
AMD is in serious financial trouble and developing new high end GPUs
(the largest die-size in mass-market computing-chips on the planet,
including CPUs...) on very small-geometry processes is exceptionally
expensive. nVidia spent $400million developing the 8xxx family. Where
is AMD/ATi going to get this sort of money for another full-fledged
turn at DX10 hardware? Seems as if they need to put every $$ they have
in fending off the Intel threat to their core CPU business.

In reply to your statement...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

.... I will say--- Do you then want to see one CPU manufacturer with
no competition?? This starkly paints the AMD/ATI dilemma. Bleeding
re-ink... where should AMD focus its efforts? If I were AMD, I would
endeavor to dump ATi ASAP. Maybe they have privately tried already
with no decent bids? If I were AMD, I would focus most of what little
development money is still available on the CPU business and let ATi
take care of the volume sweet-spots in computer core-chips with
integrated graphics and graphics engines for high-volume
consumer-devices, cell-phones, media-players etc.  I would cease any
further development in the high-end stand-alone graphics chip arena,
and just milk the 2xxx series designs as much as possible,
opportunistically adding low-cost peripheral functionality (such as
DisplayPort) to gain as much market volume traction as possible, at
least until the joint company turns a decent profi again.

Anyway, back to nVidia's current discrete-GPU exercises...

nVidia's next GPU turn is a complete re-run at their Dx10 family and
they have more than enough profits from their business to finance this
turn.  Probably compatible with DX10.1; certainly double-precision
compute-paths, certainly optimized for the DUAL alternate roles of GPU
and GPGPU from the same silicon.

The expansion of Nvidia's efforts in the GPGPU arena is a major
strategic target for the upcoming turn of the nVidia GPU family.
Besides the potential uses in home computers ranging from accelerating
features of video processing to games, there is a huge professional
market for the massive hardware parallel-processing of the GPGPU in
tandem with  nVidia's CUDA mid-level programming language specifically
targeted for the GPGPU.

AirRaid, please take your tedious and grade-school level speculative
cross postings elsewhere, unless you have already been banned from every
subscriber based forum due to your worthless ramblings.

Your posts are best kept on a private blog, where you can feel free to
opine and guess and wheeze as long and as often as you are able to cut
and paste and type.

The best part is, you will then get AD REVENUE from the COUNTLESS number
of people who will go to AirRaid's website to glean some of your
inscrutable wisdom in this field. Go now and educate us all!
