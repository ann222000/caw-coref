I've got a Nokia N95 on a monthly contract with Orange in the UK.  Would I
be able to use the SIM in an unlocked Motorola, or will it be locked to
Orange?

(Sorry if stupid question, I haven't much knowledge of these things)

Thanks.

You'll be able to use the SIM on most available handsets with virtually no
problem, as far as voice and text calls.  However the N95 will be locked to
Orange and it'll cost you about £15 to £20 to get it unlocked by them if you
want to use a different carrier's SIM in it.

Where you will have a problem with the Motorola is getting the settings
right to be able to send pictures/MMS messages, though it shouldn't take you
too long to find the settings and tap them in.

Thanks for that.  Texts should be easy enough though, on the Motorola,
shouldn't they? I'm hoping to use it when I go into town at night, then I
don't risk losing the N95 or getting it nicked :-)
Can I just say, about the Nokia, I can't believe this all-singing,
all-dancing phone doesn't have a text message reminder beep... unlike the
new Samsung &amp; Motorola models.

Cheers

If you're sent a text but don't hear the initial alert, some phones - like
the Motorola V600 I used to have - will 'beep' every few minutes to remind
you that you've got an unread text.

Now I thought there was only me that was that paranoid about having my best
'phone swiped :)  Pop your sim in the Moto, remembering of course that the
Moto isn't as swish as the N95, and try a call and text.

The beep you mention is the missed call reminder and it's been on Motos for
many years, I've had Motos for many years :)  There are plenty of
downloadable call reminder applications for the N95 but I would have
expected such a high spec. 'phone to have a simple, audible reminder built
in.

Now to your intended use.  Why don't you get a PAYG sim from Tesco (value
sim), put say £20 credit on it and *permanently* put that in the Moto for
when you visit &quot;dodgy&quot; town nights?  When you go on the razzle you can
divert all calls to the tesco sim, divert all to voicemail or leave the
Orange mobile off.  Anyone who then wants to get hold of you can call your
alternate number.  This limits the damage any scumbag can cause on your pay
monthly Orange account and leaves your N95 in a more secure location -
possibly.
