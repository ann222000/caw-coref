Hello Everyone,

I just found this group and noticed there were mentions of clubfoot
and Dr. Ponseti, and/or the Ponseti Method of clubfoot correction.

I have three sons, all born with bilateral clubfeet, six feet in
all :)   I've gone both the non-Ponseti and the Ponseti routes of
clubfoot correction over the past nine years.   I finally just started
a darn website to display the information I have gathered instead of
trying to repeat it all the time, ha.

I hope it might be of help to any parent whose child is born with this
birth defect.  I want to tell you that when treated right, it's not a
birth defect at all, just a minor bump in the road with no lasting ill
effects.  Please take a look if you need clubfoot information from A
to Z pretty much - treatment, braces, clothing, finding doctors, how
to remove casts....I add to it all the time as I learn or remember
things.

Best of luck to all the parents and all the babies,

Shawnee

I can't remember a mention of clubfoot, except ***, who's over a year old
now, and the main issue wasn't club foot, but spinabifada (sp?). I certainly
haven't seen any mentions of Ponseti. I have been losing a few messages
though.
It would be more helpful, SBM, if you replied to the specific messages with
specific answers to questions rather than a general post, as you obviously
have personal experience.

I remember it too, but as Debbie said, it was well over a year ago.  Sort of
past it's &quot;freshness&quot; date by now.

There was another one I think more recently than this one, but the lady
concerned was so unbothered by it, having previously lost a baby at 20
weeks that she barely mentioned it, I think they were also going for
Ponseti methods.

Well pardon me for stepping in where it might appear I wasn't welcome;
I found an quite a few just with a random search, discussing
treatments and problems so I posted, silly me I should have looked at
the date, maybe they were quite old.  Just trying to help.  I&quot;ll stop

Hi, Shawnee,

The posts were probably me. :)  I have mentioned the Ponseti method
here a couple of times, and there was a woman who had a son with
clubfoot here a couple years ago.  Otherwise, there hasn't been a
whole lot on the subject here.  I've posted some about Rose and when
Grant was born.  I cannot believe we're getting to almost two years
old.  i've been rather absent here lately.  i can only access this
group through google groups, and well, it sucks.

I've enjoyed reading your page.

Joy

Rose (1/99) -unilateral left clubfoot treated by Dr. Ponseti starting
at 6 months
Iris (2/01) -homebirth, no clubfeet
Spencer (3/03) -homebirth, no clubfeet
Grant (9/05) -bilateral clubfeet accompanying spina bifida,
hydrocephalus, etc.  Treated by Dr. Ponseti at 16 months.

Hi, Debbie,
Around when G was born, there was an Emily who's son was diagnosed in-
utero with clubfeet, and we spoke about the Ponseti method.  It was
two years ago!!!  I can't believe G is almost two.  Eek!!

How's that new baby doing??

I know Shawnee from another list, and her story is amazing.  Three
boys, all with clubfeet.  We're pretty passionate about Dr. Ponseti
(he's 93 years old, and he's still correcting babies feet).  :)

I think E and I had our babies about a few weeks apart.  She did treat
her little one with the Ponseti Method, but I haven't heard from her
in awhile.

There are a lot of spammers who come in here, but I think your post
was relevant.  It's hard to tell sometimes, though, and it gets
tiresome.  The posts are probably about two years old!  I can't
believe that much time has passed.  I think your site will be very
helpful for expecting parents who find out there child is to have
clubfoot.

You know, I don't really remember that. I guess Grant (I hadn't forgotten
his name, I tend not to use names here unless parent uses them first) took
up such a lot of thought with all you/he went through.
Is he really nearly 2? I thought he was about 15-18 months. Wow. How's he
doing?

I've just (today) sorted out the problem I've had for the past year or more
with losing messages. Simple reset of a minor setting.Not even sure how it
got set that way in the first place. Stupid computers. (dh says stupid me as
I must have set it wrongly in the first place)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How's that new baby doing??
">

He's 6 weeks today. Amazing! Not a newborn any more.
Putting on weight at speed. I have gold top in me (double cream milk)
He's smiling at things you do. He loves it when I hold his hands and make
them clap. He almost laughs.
He lies under the gym happily bopping the toys when I need him to, and
doesn't complain unless he has to. I was joking to dh yesterday that
sometimes I hardly know I have a baby.
He sleeps well (I got almost worried yesterday at the amount he slept) and
did his best night yet-went down at 8:30pm woke at 3:30, back down at 4:00
and woke at past 8am.
Only issues so far is he has a heart murmur and a small head. Drs. don't
think it's much but we've got the usual checks for the heart at the end of
the month and a recheck on head growth in 3 months.

I did actually genuinely mean what I wrote. I wasn't being sarcastic. To me
specific responses are much more reassuring and helpful. Also my computer
shows if I get a response to a message I wrote, so if I had posted on
clubfoot (for example) then I would see that someone had replied to me
whereas I might miss (particularly if I'd been away for a time) a new post
on the subject. Sorry to Shawnee if I caused offence, I didn't mean to, I
was mostly wondering if my computer was losing even more messages than
usual!

He'll be 22 months next week, and I still feel like he's not even a
year old. LOL

He's doing pretty well.  It's been stressful lately because he had an
ophthalmologist appointment that showed his optic nerve was swollen,
indicating pressure.  We're keeping an eye on it (haha), but it could
just indicate residual pressure and will resolve (what we're hoping).
He's also been dealing with urinary tract infection after urinary
tract infection.  I've been putting in calls to the urologist who
seems quite unconcerned, so maybe I'm overreacting.  I'm determined
that he has to come off the antibiotics.

He crawls on all fours, and he can pull to standing.  We haven't had
any cruising yet, though.  He had four surgeries on his shunt in Jan/
Feb, and they set him back a bit.  He also had rotavirus in the spring
which landed him in the hospital for a few days.

He's adding words to his vocabulary every day, and he loves animals
and makes most of their noises.  He weighs about 22 1/2 pounds, and
he's looking long!  Still breastfeeding, and he yells
&quot;eeeeeeeeeeeeaat&quot; when he thinks I don't have a clue. :)

having to use Google Groups as my main reading.

&gt; tract infection.  I've been putting in calls to the urologist who
&gt; seems quite unconcerned, so maybe I'm overreacting.  I'm determined
&gt; that he has to come off the antibiotics.

&gt; He crawls on all fours, and he can pull to standing.  We haven't had
&gt; any cruising yet, though.  He had four surgeries on his shunt in Jan/
&gt; Feb, and they set him back a bit.  He also had rotavirus in the spring
&gt; which landed him in the hospital for a few days.

Sounds like he's coming on really well. Hard when they're ill isn't it. I
guess you feel extra protective when he's ill because of what he's been
through already. Are your other children still coping well with him?
#2 didn't cruise much because of her missing hand. She did like to walk with
a babywalker, although we had to help her balance as she was only holding on
the right side. We'd put a rolled up towel under her arms and balance her
with that.

&gt; He's adding words to his vocabulary every day, and he loves animals
&gt; and makes most of their noises.  He weighs about 22 1/2 pounds, and
&gt; he's looking long!  Still breastfeeding, and he yells
&gt; &quot;eeeeeeeeeeeeaat&quot; when he thinks I don't have a clue. :)

Oh that's sweet!

&gt;&gt; I've just (today) sorted out the problem I've had for the past year or
&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt; with losing messages. Simple reset of a minor setting.Not even sure how
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; got set that way in the first place. Stupid computers. (dh says stupid me
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; I must have set it wrongly in the first place)

&gt; I think sometimes computers do things on their own... Scary things,
&gt; they are!  I can't figure out how to get my messages on oe since
&gt; something got changed, so I've been doing the google thing.  ugh.

&gt;&gt; &gt; How's that new baby doing??

&gt;&gt; He's 6 weeks today. Amazing! Not a newborn any more.
&gt;&gt; Putting on weight at speed. I have gold top in me (double cream milk)
&gt;&gt; He's smiling at things you do. He loves it when I hold his hands and make
&gt;&gt; them clap. He almost laughs.
&gt;&gt; He lies under the gym happily bopping the toys when I need him to, and
&gt;&gt; doesn't complain unless he has to. I was joking to dh yesterday that
&gt;&gt; sometimes I hardly know I have a baby.
&gt;&gt; He sleeps well (I got almost worried yesterday at the amount he slept)
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; did his best night yet-went down at 8:30pm woke at 3:30, back down at
&gt;&gt; 4:00
&gt;&gt; and woke at past 8am.

&gt; I cannot believe it's been six weeks!!  He sounds delightful. :)

&gt;&gt; Only issues so far is he has a heart murmur and a small head. Drs. don't
&gt;&gt; think it's much but we've got the usual checks for the heart at the end
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; the month and a recheck on head growth in 3 months.

&gt; I hope both appointments go well.  Do heart murmurs usually resolve?
&gt; I hope the small head is a non-issue.
">

They seem to think it'll be a resolving on it's own thing. I think a good
percentage of children have murmurs when born. Actually we have a friend
whose 10yo still has a murmur and you wouldn't ever know, so I'm not really
concerned.
The small head should be a non-issue. It's more that it hasn't grown perhaps
as much as you'd expect. Only by 1cm though, and I always think it's a bit
random the measuring. I've got a small head so the health visitor thinks
that it's just that he has too, just wants to check. The girls take after dh
who has a huge head so it feels a bit strange to still be using the early
baby hats for him, which never fitted them.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I know Shawnee from another list, and her story is amazing.  Three
&gt;&gt; &gt; boys, all with clubfeet.  We're pretty passionate about Dr. Ponseti
&gt;&gt; &gt; (he's 93 years old, and he's still correcting babies feet).  :)

&gt;&gt; I did actually genuinely mean what I wrote. I wasn't being sarcastic. To
&gt;&gt; me
&gt;&gt; specific responses are much more reassuring and helpful. Also my computer
&gt;&gt; shows if I get a response to a message I wrote, so if I had posted on
&gt;&gt; clubfoot (for example) then I would see that someone had replied to me
&gt;&gt; whereas I might miss (particularly if I'd been away for a time) a new
&gt;&gt; post
&gt;&gt; on the subject. Sorry to Shawnee if I caused offence, I didn't mean to, I
&gt;&gt; was mostly wondering if my computer was losing even more messages than
&gt;&gt; usual!

&gt; I agree that specific responses are probably more helpful.

Thanks: I was feeling maybe I had been out of order suggesting that.
