Two thoughts: 1) Nickel is a good metal for making field-emission cathodes.
2) Nickel is very common in asteroids.
Followed up by the thought that glass makes a good insulator, and there's
lots of silicon dioxide to be found in asteroids. And there's oodles of free
vacuum in which to do vapor deposition and such.

So: how far could you get with micro-scale field-emission vacuum tube tech
for colonizing / von-Neumannizing the asteroid belt? Could you build the
facilities required for producing more such electronics with nothing more
sophisticated to start with (i.e., is it sustainable)? Can you make solar
cells for power, or are you stuck with concentrating mirrors powering heat
engines? Maybe use thermionic converters?

You mean using those instead of microchips? Alas no; self-sustaining
colonization/self-replicating manufacturing even on Earth let alone in

There might be purposes for which such vacuum tubes could complement
molecular electronics etc, though.

be easier as well.  It's not like asteroids are particularly short

More trouble than they're worth for making the equivalent of modern
processors out of, perhaps. But use micro-scale field-emission components in
integrated architecture, and you should be able to push them far beyond what
vacuum tubes were ever used for in the past, just because they got replaced
by silicon ICs too soon. I'm thinking vacuum-deposited layers of nickel
sandwhiched between thin sheets of glass, with the occasional dot of
graphite (for resistors, say) or some other specialized trace materials,
layed out like a silicon IC would be.

Even comparatively low-tech microchip fabs are Really Expensive, though. And
silicon ICs are much more finicky; integrated field-emission vacuum tube
electronics ought to be able to stand a lot more abuse, and have wider
manufacturing tolerances, since they depend on bulk macroscopic properties
of the materials. You don't have to do any doping of nickel to make passable
field-emission electronics out of it. I'm a little fuzzy on just exactly
what sort of equipment would be needed to do accurate-enough deposition and
glass etching, though.

Really not at all. There's no law of physics against it of course, it's
just that the tasks associated with setting up a production line,
running a mine, troubleshooting failures etc are far beyond what today's
clumsy, stupid robots can handle. We're just going to have to keep
putting in the hard work on semiconductors, AI, nanotech etc for the moment.

Dropping the unmanned part does change the answer from &quot;no way&quot;, though
I think it changes it to &quot;probably not&quot; rather than &quot;probably&quot; (even if
we assume the use of as much of today's technology as is cost effective,
rather than talking about steampunk).

The problem is complexity, and the cost of handling that complexity. The
cost of keeping one person alive for a year in space today is thousands
of man-years of labor. That &quot;thousands&quot; has to come down to &quot;less than
one&quot; for space colonization to be viable.

Of course today's space program is on the bad end of the economy of
scale curve. It's not just the oft-mentioned matter of $/ton to orbit.
Our space station isn't big enough to rotate for gravity, so you have to
spend half the day struggling to mitigate the health effects of zero-g.
There isn't a competitive market for space suits, so the incremental
improvements that would be possible and extremely beneficial with
today's technology don't happen. Etc, etc, etc.

Suppose we postulate the existence of a single seed habitat with a
population of 10 million, in a good location e.g. the asteroid belt near
one or more asteroids containing suitable raw materials. (Why 10
million? Well I think it's a somewhat bigger habitat than could be built
in principle with today's technology if cost were no object, and a
smaller population than is needed to support modern civilization with
today's technology; I'm trying to minimize the product of the two
implausibilities :))

Would they be able to maintain their habitat while building a second
one? Once you have two then you can have four, eight etc. It's the
initial cost curves that matter. Can 10 million people be supported in
space with the labor of no more than a few million workers?

My intuition for what it's worth says not quite. Too many things would
need to go implausibly perfectly. Not a big enough market to support
competition, you'd end up with government monopolies that would get
clogged with bureaucracy over a timescale less than that required for
the second habitat, etc.

I don't think we're _that_ far short. I don't think it's going to take
unobtainium. We need more productivity, more ability to handle
complexity - and the technologies required for that are being developed
because they're economically valuable on Earth. If we keep that up, the
answer will change.

Which introduces a bit of a paradox - if you technologically and
technically advanced enough to build all the stuff that goes around
microchips (PCBs, pretty good resistors, pretty good capacitors, the
odd discrete and power transistor...), you are pretty much in a
situation where you can do without that annual shipment.  Without
those supporting factors, even low integration level microchips (circa
mid 60's) are pretty much just ballast.

Why?  Both of those seem like really dumb ideas for potential colonists.
First off, if you can make use of machinery that has already been designed
and tested rather than having to develop Super Special New Colonization
Equipment from scratch, it would seem to me a very good idea to do just
that.  Second, if you're going to be actually *colonizing*, which is to
say going out to wherever and actually living there, I don't see why you
wouldn't show up early to give the machines a hand with whatever it is
that you're better than a machine at.

Yes, there's a fairly common SFnal &quot;What If?&quot;, where someone sends out a
batch of Super Special Von Neumann Machines, which are only ever used for
space colonization, and leaves them completely alone to build lots and
lots of shiny new space colony infrastructure that people can move into
later.

But the field is big enough for a whole lot of What Ifs, so I'd prefer
to not presume than anyone who hasn't actually said so is referring to
any one in particular.  If someone says, &quot;colonization using machinery&quot;,
I'm going to assume unless specified otherwise that they're talking
about utilitarian sorts of machinery and its human operators.  You know,
the smart way to do the job.

Then there's a problem with using the, &quot;We can't even do that on Earth!&quot;

Earth's ecology, and the test for self-sufficiency has to be modified
accordingly.

I think you're going astray in assuming that the &quot;bio&quot; part is the real
obstacle here.  People who are less ambitious in the level of diversity
they demand in their closed ecologies, have done well enough that I'm
not terribly worried on that end.

The problem, is that people are going to need e.g. spacesuits, and even
Victorian-tech spacesuits are going to require e.g. regulators.  Which
will wear out.  So you need a regulator factory and a copper mine and a
zinc mine, and all the factories to produce all the wear-outable parts
of a regulator factory and a copper mine and a zinc mine, and all the
factories to produce all the stuff *those* factories need, ad infinitum.

Well, not literally infinitum.  The loop can be closed.  But getting real
closure with anything less than millions of highly-trained humans running
the machines, was and is a Very Hard Problem.  There is no industrial
equivalent of the shrimp-and-algae bulb to serve as prooof of concept
and foundation for something bigger.

This gets me thinking about keeping the closed system as simple

&gt; The problem, is that people are going to need e.g. spacesuits, and even

&gt; zinc mine, and all the factories to produce all the wear-outable parts
&gt; of a regulator factory and a copper mine and a zinc mine, and all the
&gt; factories to produce all the stuff *those* factories need, ad infinitum.
&gt; Well, not literally infinitum.  The loop can be closed.  But getting real
&gt; closure with anything less than millions of highly-trained humans running
&gt; the machines, was and is a Very Hard Problem.  There is no industrial
&gt; equivalent of the shrimp-and-algae bulb to serve as prooof of concept

To simplify a proof-of-concept as much as possible, I wonder if a
vaguely Eskimo-like closed loop could be envisioned.  Since we
have no food replicator technology, any minimal closed loop
is going to need food organisms.  Since this is already a baseline
requirement, could it be possible to fashion space suits and other
stuff from grown organisms?

Instead of &quot;factories&quot;, we're talking human labor.  The goal of the
proof-of-concept is not maximum efficiency but rather maximum
simplicity.  If it takes legions of humans to carve something by
hand where it would have only taken a dozen humans with power
tools, prefer the former so you don't have to figure out where the
power tools came from.

Obviously, if we're growing everything we're going to need water,
carbon dioxide, and light.  Mars is the obvious setting.  It's
cold enough that ice can be used for greenhouse windows.
The basic model I'm thinking is humans living in pressurized
greenhouses, along with some sort of fur producing animals
for clothes and ultimately pressure suits.

The idea that an industrial complex so versatile as to be capable of
making every single one of its own parts from scratch, will also be
so narrowly specialized as to be incapable of making anything else at
all, is too ridiculous for words.

And irrelevant, because even if the *only* thing your magic factories
can produce, are more factories, well, surplus factories are useful.
You can sell them for scrap, if nothing else.  Scrap metal is worth
real money.  Better still, scrap everything except the power-generating
part, and make your trillion dollars selling scrap metal + power.

This is starting to look a lot like yet another attempt to rationalize
Von Neumann Replicators as a Space! Only! technology, so that we can

recieve the benefits of such technology, and B: the technology will
be ready for us as soon as we get into Outer! Space!; heck, it's
ready now, we just haven't been able to put it to use here on boring

And, no.  Von Neumann Replicators would be really, really, massively

A lot of SF is only explainable by supposing that terrestrials,
or perhaps a certain subset of them, emit a magical field that keeps
certain technologies from being used on Earth. This is why Ben Bova
can have an Earth with power shortages and spacecraft generating
power at about 8 megawatts per kilogram of ship in the same setting.

At least with Charles Sheffield, there was a legitimate reason
why kernels weren't used to deal with Earth's power issues.

How marketable, though, are bacteria?  John Schilling notes
that even if the magic factories produce nothing but more
magic factories, they can be sold for scrap metal.  But this
assumes that the magic factories can be sold for scrap metal.
Bacteria can't be sold for scrap metal.

Now, let's consider a more marketable Von Neumann machine,
tuna fish.  There's an obviously viable market for tuna fish.
And look at how zero maintenance tuna fish are!  They just
grow and multiply on their own, no help from us!

But that's not the whole story.  Even though they grow and
multiply on their own, it still takes resources and effort to
gather them and bring them to where the market is.  It's
not &quot;magic&quot;, it's just one possible way to convert raw
resources into desired products.

I see no reason to expect Von Neumann Replicators to be
really, really, massively useful things to have right here on
Earth.  It's just another way to convert one thing into another
thing.  If it can economically compete with more traditional
methods, then that's great and may make someone a
gazillionaire.  But I don't see any inherent reason to expect
this to be the case.

The bacteria analogy, truly independent self replication, is something
of a red herring; if the machines are to be useful to humans (necessary
for anyone to pay for the R&amp;D), there are going to be humans around
telling them what to do if nothing else.

The real point is that machines smart enough that they _could_ build and
operate mines, factories etc unaided - or even a substantial fraction of
the way to being that smart - would be extremely useful for automating
menial work thereby amplifying human productivity.

For a self-replicator, you need a raw materials source and a power
source.  You also need some kind of control system.

There is also an issue with tolerances.  If you make the component
parts directly out of atoms, then you get the whole nanotech pre-made
parts.  However, for a 'clanking replicator', there is also a need for
a mechanism for passing on the basic measures onto the next
generation.  Each part has to be made out of bulk materials, so there
is a quality control issue.  If this isn't solved, then the final (and
intermediate) assembly steps fail as the nuts and bolts have different
diameters etc.

Ideally, these should be something that can be given as information.
The device for making a meter reference would have to be able to make
a meter reference to say 1cm tolerance from a meter reference which is
also within a 1 cm tolerance.  A method is needed to ensure that the
error doesn't grow by 1 cm every generation.

The official definitions of time and distance would actually work as
they describe a way to make a meter and how to count a second.
However, they require some pretty complex equipment to get working.

Defining a second isn't that difficult if the device can detect the
Sun.  You could have the machine time the length of time that passes
in a day and divide by 86,400.  Another option would be to send a
control pulse every minute by radio from a central location.  This
doesn't really work in a space/Alpha Centauri situation.

Repair and maintenance is also an issue.  One option is to just throw
any broken devices into a 'raw materials' box when it breaks.  Another
option is to make the whole device easy to disassemble.  Each part
could then be extracted and tested/replaced as needed.

Would it be possible to build a replicator that roams the desert and
uses solar power ?

How difficult would it be to refine sand into some kind of metal ?
Does sand in a desert have any metal content ?  There is a need to
make both the metal, but also the lining for heating the item.

I think the most difficult step is taking generic 'dirt' and
converting it into a (hopefully) small number refined basic
materials.  These would then have to be machines into their final
states and assembled.

However, that may just represent my lack of knowledge of smelting and
general metal processing.  Clearly, each stage in the process is
possible to automate as we can already do it.
