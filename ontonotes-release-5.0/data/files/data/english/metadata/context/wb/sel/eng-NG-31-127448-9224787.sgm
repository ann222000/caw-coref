Evolution and faith in God: is there any contradiction?

I believe in Darwinian evolution, DO NOT believe in creationism, DO
NOT believe in the neo-creationist &quot;intelligent design&quot; movement, BUT
believe in God. I don't see any contradiction. Where is the problem
with evolution and the faith in God?

Darwinism did not show that God is an unnecessary hypothesis. It only
showed that species evolve and that natural selection plays some role,
and that SOME things can happen by chance (and there are a lot of
things which happened by &quot;chance&quot; in my own life and nevertheless I
believe they were pre-determined). But this is far from any proof of
lack of Divine control and intervention. It would be unscientific to
claim this.

Darwinism is light years away from proving that &quot;after the first cell
the system played out for the next several billion years&quot;. To tell
people Darwinism has shown such things is not science. Put in these
terms it is a &quot;religious&quot; belief too.

Can someone help?

you are asking the wrong question. the proper question to ask is, &quot;is
my belief in god supported by any scientific evidence whatsoever?&quot; if
the answer is no, and you respect science's ability to determine how
the world works, then you should abandon the belief.

Sure. There may be no contradiction between evolution and faith in god,
but that depends on what god you have faith in. I will assume you
believe in the sort that doesn't result in contradiction, the sort who
is willing to let things take their own course over many millions of
years without the need for constant meddling.

As you point out, there can be no evidence against divine control or
meddling, if the meddling is of a sort that can't be distinguished in
any way from natural processes. Of course, scientifically speaking this
is a pointless and untestable hypothesis, but we're not talking about
science when we introduce god, for exactly that reason.

So evolution can't provide conclusive proof of the non-existence of god.
It can, however, suggest that if there is a god, he's quite different
from what people generally imagine. He doesn't appear to care about the
human species in particular, much less about individual humans. This
seems obvious not just from evolution but from the sheer size and
duration of the universe. If we were its purpose, there would be no need
to make anything so big or so old. Evolution provides only a grace note
to that theme -- if we were the purpose, the path toward us wouldn't be
so apparently random.

There is much we can learn about god -- particular sorts of god we can
rule out -- by observing the world around us. Evolution is a tiny part
of this, not worth mentioning except for the historical reason that it
appears to contradict a couple of old stories that some people consider
revealed truth. Evolution's importance in this matter is small compared
to the size and age of the universe, and they are in turn trivial
compared to the central difficulty of theism, the problem of evil.
Theologians seem generally to have realized this. Given the existence of
evil, god can't be benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient all at once;
pick two at most. So forget evolution and worry about that bigger issue.

I would agree if you reworded your first sentence a bit.  God is not a
necessary hypothesis.  God is not a disproven hypothesis, but as near
as I can tell the universe can be explained without one.

I'm afraid I disagree.  It is fairly clear that things have been
evolving right along after the occurance of the first cell.  You are
correct that no one has shown that God wasn't involved, but it really
does look like that's what happened one way or another.

Jesus?  Ahura Mazda?  Underdog?

I think that you are bit on the wrong track.  Religion is not a good
institution for explaining how the world works, and most religions
don't emphasize this role.
My view is that whatever divine influences (if any) are at work in the
universe, it's clear that we don't have the merest hint of a clue
about them, and going about making definite claims about what God
wants or is doing is just absurd.  Use religion as a motivation to be
a good person if that works for you, but I would urge you not to get
all wadded up about the state of divine reality.  If God wanted you to
know that stuff, you would surely know it.

I dont think there is any reason to abandon your belief, you seem like
a person who (from what i can gather) is open minded enough to know
the difference between mythology and testable science. If God wanted
us to be mindless drones, he wouldnt have given everyone free will.

Personally, i believe that the matter and energy in the universe had
to come from SOMEWHERE. whether that was in the form of the Christian
god, i dont know, but what i DO know is that matter and energy cannot
be created or destroyed. That is proof enough(for me at least) that
there was SOME force that came into play to start the Universe in its
cosmic dance.

(I think that the Hindu religion probably comes the closest as a
religion can to explain the way the universe works. I am not saying i
believe in a giant floating elephant, i am simply pointing out their
beliefs about human conciousness.)

It's impossible to prove the lack of Divine intervention, but it is

the world.

NO. My argument is that since energy cannot be created, SOME external

NO. I am saying that since energy and matter cannot be created,
SOMETHING had to act upon the matter in the universe to form it the
way it came to be today. ( and no, i am not a creationist.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know that stuff, you would surely know it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont think there is any reason to abandon your belief, you seem like
&gt; &gt; &gt; a person who (from what i can gather) is open minded enough to know
&gt; &gt; &gt; the difference between mythology and testable science. If God wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; us to be mindless drones, he wouldnt have given everyone free will.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, i believe that the matter and energy in the universe had

HERETIC!  It was a cat named Maeve that created the universe as is
last Thursday complete with false memories all around and invisible
pink unicorns and you can't prove otherwise.

How do we know the unicorns are invisible? Because we can't see them.
How do we know they are pink? Because we have faith. Where does Maeve
live? Maeve is a pet of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

You realize, I hope, that this assumption is based upon the universe as it
exists today.  To try to extrapolate that back into the conditions that
existed at the moment of the Big Bang is, to my mind, wrong-headed.

If the Universe behaved in the Classical fashion, you would have a point,
but as it does not, at least not in the earliest stages of its evolution, I
think you had best re-evaluate.

Help with what?  There are many churches that are quite OK with your
position; perhaps someone here can recommend a few.  If you wish to
discuss this with like-minded individuals, I'm sure they are out there.
Theistic Evolutionism is a catch-all term for people who belive in
a God or gods and also believe that geologists and paleontologists are
more or less on target about what happened and when.  The Jesuit preist
Teilhard de Chardin who is being discussed in another thread here was
one such person who was active in both theology and paleontology.

Then of course there are those &quot;Christians&quot; who insist that &quot;If the
Earth is more than 10,000 years old then scripture has no meaning.&quot;
What I have heard people like that say about people like you in the
past is, &quot;You're not a Christian, you just think you are.&quot;  But then,
these people also believe that Unicorns are related to Triceratops:

There is no need to take these people seriously.

Your asking a metaphysical question: Is science the only mechanism by

It's a dilemma. Either the universe came into being, or it
has existed forever. If it came into being, that coming into
being is contrary to an accepted law of physics, the law of
conservation of mass-energy. If it has existed forever, its
eternal duration is contrary to another known law of physics,
the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

&gt; &gt; my belief in god supported by any scientific evidence whatsoever?&quot; if
&gt; &gt; the answer is no, and you respect science's ability to determine how
&gt; &gt; the world works, then you should abandon the belief.

&gt; Your asking a metaphysical question: Is science the only mechanism by
&gt; which we can measure? Some would say yes, and that's fine. But I do not
&gt; believe that everything can be reduced to science.

as soon as you give us something else that you can show is at least as
accurate as science, then youll be welcomed to the discussion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Darwinism did not show that God is an unnecessary hypothesis. It only

&gt; &gt; &gt; and that SOME things can happen by chance (and there are a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; things which happened by &quot;chance&quot; in my own life and nevertheless I

&gt; &gt; &gt; lack of Divine control and intervention. It would be unscientific to
&gt; &gt; &gt; claim this.

&gt; &gt; I would agree if you reworded your first sentence a bit.  God is not a
&gt; &gt; necessary hypothesis.  God is not a disproven hypothesis, but as near
&gt; &gt; as I can tell the universe can be explained without one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Darwinism is light years away from proving that &quot;after the first cell
&gt; &gt; &gt; the system played out for the next several billion years&quot;. To tell
&gt; &gt; &gt; people Darwinism has shown such things is not science. Put in these
&gt; &gt; &gt; terms it is a &quot;religious&quot; belief too.

&gt; &gt; I'm afraid I disagree.  It is fairly clear that things have been
&gt; &gt; evolving right along after the occurance of the first cell.  You are
&gt; &gt; correct that no one has shown that God wasn't involved, but it really
&gt; &gt; does look like that's what happened one way or another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone help?

&gt; &gt; Jesus?  Ahura Mazda?  Underdog?

&gt; &gt; I think that you are bit on the wrong track.  Religion is not a good
&gt; &gt; institution for explaining how the world works, and most religions
&gt; &gt; don't emphasize this role.
&gt; &gt; My view is that whatever divine influences (if any) are at work in the
&gt; &gt; universe, it's clear that we don't have the merest hint of a clue
&gt; &gt; about them, and going about making definite claims about what God
&gt; &gt; wants or is doing is just absurd.  Use religion as a motivation to be
&gt; &gt; a good person if that works for you, but I would urge you not to get
&gt; &gt; all wadded up about the state of divine reality.  If God wanted you to
&gt; &gt; know that stuff, you would surely know it.

&gt; I dont think there is any reason to abandon your belief, you seem like
&gt; a person who (from what i can gather) is open minded enough to know
&gt; the difference between mythology and testable science. If God wanted
&gt; us to be mindless drones, he wouldnt have given everyone free will.
">

I definitely hope that I have not mistakenly recommended mindless
dronery!  More than anything I meant to say that when another person
disagrees with your views on religion, it's best not to froth at the
mouth because in the end you really don't know so much as you might
like to pretend about the matter (that is a general you, not you
specifically)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Personally, i believe that the matter and energy in the universe had
&gt; to come from SOMEWHERE. whether that was in the form of the Christian
&gt; god, i dont know, but what i DO know is that matter and energy cannot
&gt; be created or destroyed. That is proof enough(for me at least) that
&gt; there was SOME force that came into play to start the Universe in its
&gt; cosmic dance.

&gt; (I think that the Hindu religion probably comes the closest as a
&gt; religion can to explain the way the universe works. I am not saying i
&gt; believe in a giant floating elephant, i am simply pointing out their
&gt; beliefs about human conciousness.)
">

That's possibly all true, I've no idea.  And frankly, I don't see the
point worrying about things I don't know and can never know.

The fact that there are questions that science cannot answer means that
there is a need for answers derived from outside science. That they
require a starting point that lies outside of methodological naturalism
means that you have to move into a metaphysical sphere. If you choose,
as you obviously have, to rely on metaphysical naturalism then that is
of course right. But don't try to claim that the METAPHYSICAL ideas that
arise from METHODOLOGICAL naturalism are anything but an extrapolation
beyond the bounds of that very naturalism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claim this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would agree if you reworded your first sentence a bit.  God is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary hypothesis.  God is not a disproven hypothesis, but as
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as I can tell the universe can be explained without one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darwinism is light years away from proving that &quot;after the first
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cell
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the system played out for the next several billion years&quot;. To

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid I disagree.  It is fairly clear that things have been

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct that no one has shown that God wasn't involved, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does look like that's what happened one way or another.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone help?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jesus?  Ahura Mazda?  Underdog?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that you are bit on the wrong track.  Religion is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; institution for explaining how the world works, and most religions
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't emphasize this role.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My view is that whatever divine influences (if any) are at work in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe, it's clear that we don't have the merest hint of a clue
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them, and going about making definite claims about what God
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wants or is doing is just absurd.  Use religion as a motivation to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a good person if that works for you, but I would urge you not to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all wadded up about the state of divine reality.  If God wanted
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know that stuff, you would surely know it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont think there is any reason to abandon your belief, you seem
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a person who (from what i can gather) is open minded enough to know
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the difference between mythology and testable science. If God wanted
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; us to be mindless drones, he wouldnt have given everyone free will.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, i believe that the matter and energy in the universe had
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to come from SOMEWHERE. whether that was in the form of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Christian
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; god, i dont know, but what i DO know is that matter and energy
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be created or destroyed. That is proof enough(for me at least) that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there was SOME force that came into play to start the Universe in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; its
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cosmic dance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (I think that the Hindu religion probably comes the closest as a

&gt;&gt;&gt; NO. My argument is that since energy cannot be created, SOME external

&gt;&gt;&gt; the universe as we know it. Whether that is God or a tunafish
&gt;&gt;&gt; sandwich, SOMEHITNG did it.

&gt;&gt; so its a non-sequitur then.

&gt; It's a dilemma. Either the universe came into being, or it

">

Laws of physics are based on observations of what happens within our own
Universe.  We know the Universe began expanding from a very small volume
about 13.3 BYA.  We have no firm idea how it came into being, but &quot;whatever&quot;
caused it may well have violated current conservation laws from our point of
view, but perhaps not when viewed from the &quot;multiverse&quot; POV.

Dark Energy may well be a violation of the laws of conservation of
mass-energy.  Or not.  We don't know enough about this yet to say exactly
what it is.

I don't regard this state of ignorance as some sort of proof of the
existence of God.  Or of the primal tunafish sandwich.

In relativistic physics mass is not conserved. (In quantum mechanics
there are even caveats on conservation of energy - delta E x delta t is
of the order of h-bar.) With regards to conservation of energy it might
turn out that the total amount of energy in the universe is zero.

It could be argued that the laws of physics only apply within the
universe, thus the coming into being doesn't necessarly violate them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why?
It's well know that the second law of thermodynamics is a statistical
law that may only for sufficently short time intervals.

Say that you have an ideal gas stored in a ideal perfectly insulated
container. All interactions between any gas molecule and any other gas
molecule or the container are deterministic and perfectly elastic (a
common toy model in physics).
The gas starts in an ordered configuration, the shape of a panda's
thumb for instance.
Quickly the gas expands filling all the available volume, a more
disordered configuration.
Will it ever return to its original configuration? Common sense and
the laws of thermodynamics say no, but the laws of mechanics say yes:
given enough time the gas will return to its initial configuration and
then expand again, over and over forever, always following the same
trajectory in the state space.

Likewise you could have an universe bound in an eternal cycle of
expansions and contractions.

That's the hundred-thousand-dollar question, it seems.  For most
theists, including most Christians, there's no contradiction.
However, some people, like young-earth creationists, insist on a
literal interpretation of Genesis.  Those folks have a problem with
any science that indicates that the world/universe is billions of
years old, or that we evolved from previous species.

True.  There are a few fanatics on the other side of the fence that

as bogus as those of the creationists.

&quot;Darwinism&quot; is an inaccurate term usually used by the anti-science
crowd.  Biological evolution is a very complex subject -- see the FAQs

Evolution says nothing whatsoever about the existence or non-existence
of God. Neither does any other branch of science. As for God being an
unnecessary hypothesis, although I do believe in God, I don't think
he is necessary for explaining the internal consistency of his creation
(which is basically what science is doing).

Does the fact that something is internally consistent mean that it
can't have been created? I don't think so.

Nevertheless, the existence of divine control and intervention is not
necessary to explain common descent, or all the complexity resulting
from evolution.

My field of science is not biology, but artificial intelligence, and
one of the techniques used there is genetic programming, which is
basically using the exact same evolutionary mechanism to evolve
software (algorithms, representations of something, whatever). And
once set up, it requires no control or intervention, yet it results
in highly complex, accurate and subtle solutions.

If I can do that, why can't God?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can someone help?

Simple: the fact that something isn't *necessary* to explain something,
doesn't constitute proof that it doesn't exist at all.

If you're looking for scientific proof of God's existence, then I
suggest you stop looking. If you *need* proof in order to believe
in God, then your faith isn't very strong. Accept that as a mere
human, you can never know or prove everything there is to know.
Science is quite an effective system for finding out whatever truth
there is for us too know, however.

Depends entirely on your model of God, doesn't it?  If you have faith in
the Hairy Thunderer of the Old Testament, you could have a problem with
evolution.  If you believe that God and the universe are one and the

at all.  If fact, you'd probably venerate it as a profound manifestation

With liberal Christianity, where the Bible is mostly symbolic and
allegorical, you have a lot of freedom to adjust the details in your
model of God to bring it into conformity with the scientific view of
reality.  So again, no problem.  If you don't like the detailed theistic
model your religious peer group uses, you can quit and join another one,

That seems to be a rather strong statement. (It seems to be

On the one hand, I would question whether everything that is
the subject of science can be measured. &quot;Measured&quot;, I take
it, means &quot;given a real number value&quot;. That seems to be
overly restrictive. What about symmetries which do not take
real number values? What about logical relationships?

On the other hand, I would question whether everything that

that immediately comes to mind is economic data.

Here are two books that might help:

'Can a Darwinian be a Christian ?' by Michael Ruse - takes on all the
difficult questions involved.
'Rocks of Ages' by S.J. Gould

Science cannot and should not do the following:

Say anything about metaphysics - including if God exists.
Say anything about the 'why' of anything
Say anything about human ethics

If science does any of the above it is no longer science. Science can
only tell us about the what and how of the physical universe.

Science can have a lot to say about misguided ideas about God,
miracles, history, etc. For example science can exclude certain events
as plausible (eg. Noah's ark) and make us rethink of what kind of God
does exist (if He/She exists) but the above limits are still there.

Is this science:

&quot;Transcription is the process through which a DNA sequence is
enzymatically copied by an RNA polymerase to produce a complementary
RNA. So to say, it is the transfer of genetic information from DNA into
RNA. In the case of protein-encoding DNA, transcription is the beginning
of the process that ultimately leads to the translation of the genetic
code (via the mRNA intermediate) into a functional peptide or protein.
The stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a
transcription unit. Transcription has some proofreading mechanisms, but
they are fewer and less effective than the controls for copying DNA;
therefore, transcription has a lower copying fidelity than DNA replication.&quot;

Does it involve measurement?

Reminds me of an exchange I had with r.norman where I said I thought
much of biology is qualitative -- still objective, but non-quantitative.

Of course, you could always claim that naming a molecule like &quot;RNA
polymerase&quot; corresponds to a making &quot;a measurement.&quot;  In which case your
definition of measurement becomes so broad that it says nothing and
doesn't discriminate anything.

&gt; &gt;&gt;That seems to be a rather strong statement. (It seems to be

&gt; &gt;&gt;On the one hand, I would question whether everything that is
&gt; &gt;&gt;the subject of science can be measured. &quot;Measured&quot;, I take
&gt; &gt;&gt;it, means &quot;given a real number value&quot;. That seems to be
&gt; &gt;&gt;overly restrictive. What about symmetries which do not take
&gt; &gt;&gt;real number values? What about logical relationships?

&gt; &gt;&gt;On the other hand, I would question whether everything that
&gt; &gt;&gt;can be measured is the subject of a science. The one example

&gt; &gt; I intend it to be a strong statement. But it does not imply that
&gt; &gt; measurement is ipso facto science. Carpentry uses rather exact
&gt; &gt; measurements, and is not science. Nor does it imply that all of science
&gt; &gt; is measurement or deals with measurement, although I am hard pressed to
&gt; &gt; think of an exception right now.

&gt; Is this science:

&gt; &quot;Transcription is the process through which a DNA sequence is
&gt; enzymatically copied by an RNA polymerase to produce a complementary
&gt; RNA. So to say, it is the transfer of genetic information from DNA into
&gt; RNA. In the case of protein-encoding DNA, transcription is the beginning
&gt; of the process that ultimately leads to the translation of the genetic
&gt; code (via the mRNA intermediate) into a functional peptide or protein.
&gt; The stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a
&gt; transcription unit. Transcription has some proofreading mechanisms, but
&gt; they are fewer and less effective than the controls for copying DNA;
&gt; therefore, transcription has a lower copying fidelity than DNA replication.&quot;

&gt; Does it involve measurement?
">

If I may be allowed a moment of pedanticness, I'd say that this is not
science, but a fact discovered by scientists.  Measurement may not be
the best all-purpose term though, maybe &quot;definable observations&quot; might
work better.

If the statement can be said to be true, then yes.  How could,
&quot;Transcription has some proofreading mechanisms, but they are fewer and
less effective than the controls for copying DNA&quot;, be stated as fact
without some measurements to back it up?  Everything stated in the
paragraph has to be backed up by observation.  Every observation can be
stated as a numeric measurement.  Yes or no is a binary measurement.
The statement is a narrative constructed from the observations of
science and I call that science.

Yes.  Well, more specifically, it is the result of calculations based on
measured morphological and/or genetic data.  Granted, sometimes the
measurement of an individual datum is simply presence vs. absence of a
trait, but that still qualifies.

uhhh no. reality is what actually exists. if you make a statement

way. you dont get to just make claims and demand that unless somebody
disproves them, they are true.

you claim that there is some method for discovering truths about

&gt; &gt; &gt; Then prove to me, using only the methods of science, why human life has
&gt; &gt; &gt; value in a general sense.

&gt; &gt; i dont need to, since i have never made that claim.

&gt; &gt; whats worse, i can turn it around on you. prove to me, using ANY
&gt; &gt; method, why human life has value in the general sense.

&gt; It's intrinsic in the philosophy of the imago dei.

im sorry, i thought i asked you to prove something, not simply assert
it. what part of that was not clear?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that science cannot answer every possible question is not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; license to make shit up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that there are questions that science cannot answer means that
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a need for answers derived from outside science. That they
&gt; &gt; &gt; require a starting point that lies outside of methodological naturalism
&gt; &gt; &gt; means that you have to move into a metaphysical sphere. If you choose,
&gt; &gt; &gt; as you obviously have, to rely on metaphysical naturalism then that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; of course right. But don't try to claim that the METAPHYSICAL ideas that
&gt; &gt; &gt; arise from METHODOLOGICAL naturalism are anything but an extrapolation
&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond the bounds of that very naturalism.

&gt; &gt; the fact that there are questions that science cannot answer proves
&gt; &gt; that there are questions that science cannot answer. it does not mean
&gt; &gt; that there must be other methods that can answer them. if you are so
&gt; &gt; desperate for certain answers that you think making shit up is
&gt; &gt; justified, then you are not an intellectually honest person.

&gt; &gt; &lt;snip sigs&gt;

&gt; Again, I don't care a whit about your metaphysical basis, but you are
&gt; falling into the definition that Wilkins made in another post that only
&gt; that which can be measured is open to science.

no, i am simply asking you to back up your assertions. you assert that
there is a non-scientific method of discovering truths about reality.
if you cannot demonstrate that such is the case, you are simply lying
and not to be taken seriously.

I believe in genetic variation as taught by Mendel.  Some people
confuse Mendel's genetics with evolution.  Additionally there are
different definitions of evolution.   Most creationists, as I do,
believe in micro evolution or Mendel's genetics.   But creationists do
not believe in macro evolution, or evolution from monkeys. This is
based on scientific observation, namely, indirect observation that
shows there are no transitional forms, and all claims to transitional
forms are based on subjective analysis, and determined by a small
cadre of evolutioinists who have control of the few textbook
companies, and influence many of the ignorant.

&gt; Darwinism did not show that God is an unnecessary hypothesis. It only
&gt; showed that species evolve and that natural selection plays some role,
&gt; and that SOME things can happen by chance (and there are a lot of
&gt; things which happened by &quot;chance&quot; in my own life and nevertheless I
&gt; believe they were pre-determined). But this is far from any proof of
&gt; lack of Divine control and intervention. It would be unscientific to
&gt; claim this.

&gt; Darwinism is light years away from proving that &quot;after the first cell
&gt; the system played out for the next several billion years&quot;. To tell
&gt; people Darwinism has shown such things is not science. Put in these
&gt; terms it is a &quot;religious&quot; belief too.

&gt; Can someone help?
