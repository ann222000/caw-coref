My '76 LP has developed some dead spots in the
first and second position and a fret job
would do it wonders.

Actually the fret board is quite worn too.

Any idea what this would cost to get refurbished ?

Or at least a fret job ?

I looked at StewMac tools and I'm not quite ready to
go ruin a 30 year old Gibson. It is not a bolt
on neck.

It is usually $10 per fret. If you do the whole thing you may
require a crown and level as well. If the repair guy will do
all that and the complete neck for $175, it sounds like a
good price.

I remember years ago, my sister in law had this tv that was broken. This
kid that lived down the street from her, a geek, said he could fix it,
so she let him take it home to work on it.

A month later she decided she needed to go check on it, went to his
house and knocked on the door. His mom answered and when my sister in
law asked about her tv, the boy's mom said that he was &quot;mentally
challenged&quot; ( I am trying to be nice here..) and there was no way he
knew anything about tvs.  They went to his room and the tv was there in
pieces....

Now I'm not saying that you are mentally challenged Guy, just that
people should not turn things over to other people to be repaired unless
you know who you are dealing with.

I just thought it was a funny story....

Well, if you feel like driving over to the Big Greasy,
I know several guitar techs who do top quality work.
In fact their fret jobs look it came from the factory.
Some of them build guitars, one guy even builds violins too.
Look me up if you do drive into town.

If that binding is removed and/or replaced for your fret job, that individual greatly killed the
value of your guitar.

Any guitar tech/luthier who says otherwise, is a fool... and you should run for the hills with your
guitar.

Finding the right man for the job these days is more your problem than getting the best price.  It's
not easy to find that experienced old school guitar craftsman who practices the time tested methods
of the past.

What ever his/her price is, pay it, and protect your investment.

The hardest thing to do is a great fret job, after someone has done a shit fret job.

I have had to fill in butchered fret slots, then re-cut them to the proper size, to save a fine
instrument many times through the years.  Some come out looking like the frets have NEVER been
replaced.  Maple Telecaster necks can't hide this kind of involved work at the fret ends due to the
lack of binding to hide it from view.

For the precision handwork involved to save such a neck, your are looking at more than 5 times the
handwork involved in doing a fret job the right way in the first place... over the short-cut methods
practiced today by many.

It's more important you find the right guy for the job, bite the bullet, pay the price, enjoy
another 30 years from a fine instrument, and know the value of your investment is intact.

There's and old man that works across the isle in Tonecraft Amps in
Austin that does work...might call him...many tech's in Austin...call
Ray Hennigs and ask.. and Houston likely has some great techs also...
I think there is a shop called Rockin Robin there that might give you
a clue...I DO NOT recommend anyone..just a hint where to
look...Abilene has a girl tech in Detherage music that supposedly does
work...charg $80 for a setup though.. J.P.

Which certainly leaves a lot to the imagination.  Mine is a rare 73

Sound advice!  Since I'm in Seattle, I had Mike Lull do my vintage
Strat.  He's not cheap, but he's good and has a good reputation.  I
don't plan on selling it, but if I had to, or if my estate does at some
time in the future, I've got Mike's receipt to prove the work.

Now, if it was just a common value player, it'd be a different story...
But you really should protect the value of an original 30 year old
guitar.

That looks like a fine piece of work from the pics, so I'll ask a slightly
OT question. The (bound) fretboard extension on my Beltona tricone is
slightly raised, so that it would not be possible to set the action low
without filing the frets very low. I know that the extension frets are
epoxied in, those on the neck aren't. Would it be possible for a good
repairer to get these frets out and level the fretboard before refretting?

Thanks.

Fret jobs run approximately $200 on average. I would suppose the
binding would cause more work and might add another $100 to the job. I
would think a tech could quote an estimated price before he started
but then again as RK has stated, sometimes there is fretboard repair
to be done if someone has superglued the fret in and removing it
gouges the fretboard. Then it needs to be repaired before rplacing the
fret. That is usually not the techs fault and might be considered an
unforseen extra timewise and material wise. So, in reality, an
estimate is all you could get anyways and a phone call will probably
get you that. I would think that the quality of work might be more
important than the price on an old guitar. He does not want to ship
his axe so that limits the techs to the area he is willing to travel
in to get the work done. As with all trades, there are fakers and
there are shakers that can move the earth. And as always, the rock
star acting wannabes with more mouth than ass. And I'm sure OC Cal is
no exception. The only thing that holier than thou attitude gets you
is less good customers and more cheapskate asshole customers. And
people that act like that deserve what they get! Never heard of the
word gracious.

Dan Erlewine has a book full of useful superglue info.

Like it or not, the stuff is legit. Like so much else in life it's all about how
you use it. The best mechanics I know own and use vise grips, just not for

&gt; would think a tech could quote an estimated price before he started
&gt; but then again as RK has stated, sometimes there is fretboard repair
&gt; to be done if someone has superglued the fret in and removing it
&gt; gouges the fretboard. Then it needs to be repaired before rplacing the
&gt; fret. That is usually not the techs fault and might be considered an
&gt; unforseen extra timewise and material wise. So, in reality, an
&gt; estimate is all you could get anyways and a phone call will probably
&gt; get you that.

There's a sign which belongs in all repair shops:

Hourly Rates

Regular: $60.00
If you already tried to fix it yourself: $90.00
If your friend helped you: $125.00
If the two of you followed advice you got on the internet: $150.00

StewMac supplies has different types of SG ...
It's a modern day barb-wire/bailing wire/duct tape/tie wrap/
solution and all you need on a deserted island or tool bench.

I'm waiting on a Myth Busters segment on it.

ok . It was discovered in 1945,
marketed in 1955, renamed SG in the 70's .
The rest is a sticky history.

Well if you can't afford to have the friggin thing worked on, why did
you bother to bring it up in the first place???  Cash your next
welfare check, don't spend it at the local bar, and get the axe
refretted.  Or fuck off already...

&gt; If that binding is removed and/or replaced for your fret job, that individual greatly killed the

Rich K, what exactly are you referring to here about the binding?  I
have a 60's ES-335, and I am tempted to take it to Peekamoose in NYC.
They have a Plek machine, which I am persuaded does fantastic fret
leveling.  The problem is, they told me that they won't restore the
nibs on the end of the frets, that is, the little places where the
white fretboard binding covers the fret ends.

Is not restoring the nibs a mistake??  Doesn't seem like too big a
deal to me, but I'd hate to destroy the value of the instrument.  As
it is it looks great but plays like one of Gibson's worst guitars, and
always has, even when I bought it as a lad.
