I am working on *all* actionscript project and i need help from an
&quot;actionscript code - api sleuth&quot;.  I have a little difficulty with the
some of the api.  I approached turning an embedded graphic asset as a
sprite into a bitmapData object.  I hit a roadblock on copying a a
sprite with this embedded asset into another sprite.   I tried
casting... I tried a bunch of different ways, but got an error - illegal
bitmapData object etc..

If you don't mind, and you can help, PLEASE post an example of how to do
this.   I really would appreciate it.   I don't know if I missed
something but there is no example of this scenario.  Of course, examples
are the key for me to learn these concepts.

Thanks,
Patrick

P.S.  I am able to copy loaded content fine  - it's embedded assets that
are the biggest challenge.

You might show a small example of the code with the error. That
sometimes gets a bit more interest than a description.

I've never had any problems using this function to return an embedded
asset as a bitmap which I can then manipulate or attach.

The getQualifiedSuperclassName if-statement is there because I have
some assets with scale-9 enabled and they are returned as sprites, so
I convert them first.

public static function getInterfaceAssetasBitmap
(interfaceAsset:String):Bitmap {
var assetClass:Class = getDefinitionByName(interfaceAsset) as Class;
var returnBitmap:Bitmap;
if ( getQualifiedSuperclassName(assetClass)==&quot;mx.core::SpriteAsset&quot;) {
var asset:Sprite = new assetClass();
var bitmapData:BitmapData = new BitmapData(asset.width,
asset.height, true, 0x00FFFFFF);
bitmapData.draw(asset);
returnBitmap.bitmapData=bitmapData;
} else if ( getQualifiedSuperclassName(assetClass)
==&quot;mx.core::BitmapAsset&quot;) {
returnBitmap = new assetClass();
}
return(returnBitmap);

Alan:

I just picked up essential actionscript 3 and this sort of issue is
addressed on page 657 and already solved my issue.

i don't know why adobe left the mx.core.bitmap asset out of flash cs3
all together but at least i learned how to compile flash actionscript 3
with the bare minimum flex classes.

Thanks for your time.
Patrick
