You can't cancel a contract if you RELOCATE to Iraq in defense of
Operation Induring Freedom. Thank you Bally's Total Fitness. You suck
ass.

Section 7 of Bally's contract states that if you RELOCATE 25 miles
away that you may cancel your contract. Apparently relocating with
official orders to Iraq and relocating THOUSANDS of miles away doesn't
mean crap to Bally's. Here's the deal, I was satisfied with Bally's
UNTIL I tried to cancel my contract while I was deployed. The Bally's
at the Quarry Marketplace in San Antonio, TEXAS (of all friggin'
places) sucks ass. They said that there was no way that I could cancel
the contract since I wasn't technically MOVING to Iraq. WHAT THE
HELL?! I have orders that put me in Iraq for an indefinite time frame
(yes, soldiers get their tours extended all the friggin time). I will
be living in a damn tent and I can damn sure promise you there isn't a
Bally's in Baghdad, Iraq. Additionally, that lying two-faced sales
representative at Bally's verbally stated that all I had to do was
show my orders moving me from San Antonio and it would be that easy to
get out of my contract. He lied!

Here's the deal if you are military. We all know that we may end up
deploying. It happens. We are in the military and our country needs
us. If you join Bally's and end up deploying they simply don't give a
damn. They don't support US Soldiers at all. They lie. Don't believe
what they tell you when you sign up becuase it is all a bunch of horse
crap. This I guarantee you. If you want to be locked into a LOAN for
three years and pay for a gym that you can't use while fighting for
the U.S. in Iraq then sign your life away. Otherwise find alternative
means. Trust me, Bally's Total Fitness sucks ass

Also, if you are a civilian look at it this way. If Bally's won't let
soldiers deploying thousands of miles away to another country cancel
their contract, do you think they will every let you cancel yours if
you move to another city in the U.S.?

a) does your mommy know you're trolling on usenet?

b) if by some minimal chance you're this fucked up that you don't have a
clue, try looking in the mirror and repeating &quot;this is the face of a
moron&quot;

c) I betcha that if you asked bally's, for real, they'd be a lot nicer
than the fantasy yarn you're spinning.

d) oh, and for good measure, there's always the &quot;soldiers and sailors
civil relief act&quot;, made popular by ex President Clinto.

&gt; Welcome to unregulated capitalism. Please bend over. Free grease for

"/> The situation has ZIPPO to do with &quot;unregulated capitalism&quot; moron!

It has to do with Bally's:

- not living up to their word/contract
- OP not being aware of possible redress (talk to Bally's corporate, write
that letter to local paper, talk to congressional rep, cancel the contract
himself for breach after talking to a lawyer, getting the army/reserves
involved, etc.)

&gt; Not to mention the Better Bidness Bureau.

look up the definition of &quot;resident&quot; for your state

IMHO &quot;I wasn't technically MOVING&quot; is a judicial determination ,I think
they have no right to tell you what your intent is

don't blame Ballys, its just some corporate fuckwit shill

What EXACTLY does the wording of the contract say anyway?

&gt; Nope, I'd have laws passed so no one or group or corp could own more
&gt; than 10, and no possibility for franchising. I'd also call for the
&gt; gov't to pay for memberships or after-school programs for kids, and
&gt; the presidential fitness award would be funded with money to provide

&gt; b) if by some minimal chance you're this fucked up that you don't have a
&gt; clue, try looking in the mirror and repeating &quot;this is the face of a
&gt; moron&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; c) I betcha that if you asked bally's, for real, they'd be a lot nicer
&gt; than the fantasy yarn you're spinning.

"/> 1. I went to the Bally's in San Antonio, TX (Quarry Marketplace) and
asked the lady at the counter if I could cancel my membership since I
was deploying to Iraq. She gave me a number to call and said they
didn't have the contracts at the gym. I called the number and they
told me that Bally's doesn't cancel memberships for soldiers deploying
(i.e. relocating) to Iraq. You want to call her and get the same
fucking answer?!

Fantasy yarn. You're the one living the fantasy that Bally's is this
great club that would NEVER do such a thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; d) oh, and for good measure, there's always the &quot;soldiers and sailors
&gt; civil relief act&quot;, made popular by ex President Clinto.

"/> The Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act covers LEASES and CREDIT
CARD debit encountered before active duty service. I know this because
I used to to reduce debt incurred prior to my enrollment into active
duty many years ago. It doesn't do shit against people like Bally's.
Maybe YOU need to look it up and tell me how it even remotely applies.

Look man. I enjoyed going to this gym. It wasn't until I got orders to
deploy for 12 to 18 months that I wanted to cancel. I see deployment
orders as RELOCATING. Bally's doesn't. I'm not making any of this shit
up. The sales representative told me that if I got deployment orders
that it would be no problem whatsoever if I tried to cancel my
membership. I specifically asked him because I knew there was a chance
I would be deployed. By the way, I joined over eight months ago, if
this matters at all.

Screw it. You obviously aren't in the military. It would be nice if
some people showed some support for soldiers. Bally's doesn't and
neither do you.

&gt;&gt;I don't understand why the fact that you're military gives you extra

&gt;&gt;Bally's to treat me the same way as you.

&gt; You have a choice though. Being as he joined the military, he
&gt; doesn't-the government quite literally owns you and he can't quit his
&gt; job or leave, nor can he choose his deployment. Thats where GI Joe

&gt;&gt;I'd say that signing your life away = going to Iraq, but that's just my

&gt;&gt;Enjoy your tour in Iraq, fighting for freedom (such as that which
&gt;&gt;&quot;Bally's has given you&quot;)

&gt; It didn't used to be wealthy. During the 1970's and 1960's they upped

&gt; mention made laws that ensured worker's and consumer's rights.

&gt; As a result businesses had to ensure they gave you their money's worth
&gt; when you bought something. No quality assurance problems or
&gt; meaningless expensive lawsuits, but good products. Plus, with all the
&gt; extra tax money, they were able to fund those educational and other
&gt; programs, which resulted in greater income and better workers.

&gt; But they had to start taxing and checking FIRST, which they did back
&gt; when I lived there. Afterwards, they had the jobs stay and more move
&gt; in and get created. But the taxation came first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not only do they have enough money to eat, they have money

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;official orders to Iraq and relocating THOUSANDS of miles away
&gt;&gt;doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mean crap to Bally's. Here's the deal, I was satisfied with
Bally's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UNTIL I tried to cancel my contract while I was deployed. The
Bally's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at the Quarry Marketplace in San Antonio, TEXAS (of all friggin'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;places) sucks ass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're in Texas, home to our current pres. and a very conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place. I'd write the local paper and tel lthem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't believe they are such money grubbing freaks they would do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How low can you go?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They said that there was no way that I could cancel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the contract since I wasn't technically MOVING to Iraq. WHAT THE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HELL?! I have orders that put me in Iraq for an indefinite time
frame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(yes, soldiers get their tours extended all the friggin time). I
will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be living in a damn tent and I can damn sure promise you there
isn't
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bally's in Baghdad, Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe a torture chamber, but that's a different kind of &quot;rack&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, that lying two-faced sales
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;representative at Bally's verbally stated that all I had to do was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;show my orders moving me from San Antonio and it would be that
easy
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get out of my contract. He lied!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welcome to unregulated capitalism. Please bend over. Free grease
for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your rear in the men's room.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The situation has ZIPPO to do with &quot;unregulated capitalism&quot; moron!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It has to do with Bally's:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- not living up to their word/contract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- OP not being aware of possible redress (talk to Bally's corporate,
&gt;&gt;write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that letter to local paper, talk to congressional rep, cancel the
&gt;&gt;contract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself for breach after talking to a lawyer, getting the
army/reserves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involved, etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;MuppetMan would have us all working out in government-regulated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fitness collectives.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, I'd have laws passed so no one or group or corp could own more
&gt;&gt;&gt; than 10, and no possibility for franchising. I'd also call for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; gov't to pay for memberships or after-school programs for kids, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the presidential fitness award would be funded with money to provide
&gt;&gt;&gt; for people to work towards fitness.

&gt;&gt;Would there be any money left for us to eat on after you took eeverything
&gt;&gt;out to pay for all your fantasy do gooder programs?

&gt; Sure. Look at MA. The state has a lower unemployment rate than the US,
&gt; higher standard of living, and all those after-school programs I'vem
&gt; entioned. Not only do they have enough money to eat, they have money
&gt; to run businesses too.

"/> They also have Ted Kennedy. The largesse of Kennedy's body is matched only
by the largesse he steals from the rest of the country in federal grants and
subsidies for those programs.

become more and more dependent on the state. This is the antithesis of &quot;a

&gt;&gt;Yes, there is a voluntary version. The old-fashioned word for it is
&gt;&gt;&quot;charity.&quot; It is funded and performed by people who actually believe
&gt;&gt;in what they're doing, which is why it is much more effective than
&gt;&gt;similar programs administered by the government.

&gt; Got any proof?

US,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; higher standard of living, and all those after-school programs I'vem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entioned.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IOW it's a wealthy state, so they can afford the after-school
programs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How would that work in poor states with higher unemployment rates and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lower standard of living? Where would the money come from?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It didn't used to be wealthy. During the 1970's and 1960's they upped
&gt;&gt;&gt; their tax rates, and started doing Quality of life programs, not to
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention made laws that ensured worker's and consumer's rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As a result businesses had to ensure they gave you their money's worth
&gt;&gt;&gt; when you bought something. No quality assurance problems or
&gt;&gt;&gt; meaningless expensive lawsuits, but good products. Plus, with all the
&gt;&gt;&gt; extra tax money, they were able to fund those educational and other
&gt;&gt;&gt; programs, which resulted in greater income and better workers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But they had to start taxing and checking FIRST, which they did back
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I lived there. Afterwards, they had the jobs stay and more move
&gt;&gt;&gt; in and get created. But the taxation came first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not only do they have enough money to eat, they have money
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to run businesses too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But that's where the money comes from. Businesses pay taxes. They
employ
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people, who pay taxes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But they have to tax them first, to start the whole cycle. It trickles
&gt;&gt;&gt; up, not down.

&gt;&gt;So why didn't it work in England?

&gt; It did, then Thatcher modified the tax laws, and voila, you have the
&gt; current economy.

&gt; They are not

&gt;&gt;Other &quot;western&quot; nations are trying to dig out from a couple decades of
&gt;&gt;moving to the socialist bent; Germany for example.

&gt; Wel lI haven't seen anything about that. I do knwo where I used to
&gt; live the Germans bought our water company and a number of smaller
&gt; corporations, sothey don't seem to be suffering at all, either.

&gt; The only people whoweren't moving manufacturing there were Americans.

&gt;&gt;Consider that as a state provides for more and more services, the people
&gt;&gt;become more and more dependent on the state.

&gt; That's not true inMA. As the money trickled up fromworkers, they got
&gt; less and less dependent onit.

&gt; This is the antithesis of &quot;a
&gt;&gt;government governs best which governs least&quot; -a dictum that the US
followed
&gt;&gt;until the instatement oof the income tax.

&gt; Wel lI doubt that. The gov't has been steadily getting bigger since
&gt; int's inception, and there has never been a change inthat either.
&gt; The income tax was just a simpler way of taxing, instead of al lthe
&gt; ridiculous tariffs and little taxes on things we used to have.

&gt; Then the pigs troughs were built
&gt;&gt;willy nilly and at a frenetic pace that has not stopped.

&gt; Mostly by Republicans. Have you noticed the presidents wh ospend the
&gt; most are always fro mthat party? Reagan and Bush jr?

&gt;&gt;THe US *has* many aspects that re socialist in nature - and to the extent
we
&gt;&gt;have such - it is bad.

&gt; I doubt that. Look at MA- they are better off than the 46 states below
&gt; them.

&gt;&gt;But then, the frog cooks slowly in those nations too.

&gt; Funny, if they are going down hill why is there standard fo living so
&gt; much higher and why are they responsible for 25% of the investment
&gt; over here?

&gt; If taxes are taking away so much of their money, why can they spend it
&gt; over here?

&gt; I am sorry you seem to think I'm a total socialist or comunist, but
&gt; that is your choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, there is a voluntary version. The old-fashioned word for it is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The situation has ZIPPO to do with &quot;unregulated capitalism&quot; moron!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It has to do with Bally's:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- not living up to their word/contract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- OP not being aware of possible redress (talk to Bally's corporate,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that letter to local paper, talk to congressional rep, cancel the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself for breach after talking to a lawyer, getting the
&gt;&gt;army/reserves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involved, etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;MuppetMan would have us all working out in government-regulated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fitness collectives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, I'd have laws passed so no one or group or corp could own more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 10, and no possibility for franchising. I'd also call for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gov't to pay for memberships or after-school programs for kids, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the presidential fitness award would be funded with money to provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for people to work towards fitness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Would there be any money left for us to eat on after you took eeverything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out to pay for all your fantasy do gooder programs?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure. Look at MA. The state has a lower unemployment rate than the US,
&gt;&gt;&gt; higher standard of living, and all those after-school programs I'vem
&gt;&gt;&gt; entioned. Not only do they have enough money to eat, they have money
&gt;&gt;&gt; to run businesses too.

&gt;&gt;They also have Ted Kennedy. The largesse of Kennedy's body is matched only
&gt;&gt;by the largesse he steals from the rest of the country in federal grants and
&gt;&gt;subsidies for those programs.

&gt;Which stilldon't make upfor the majority of the spending there, BTW.
&gt;BTW, Sen Domenici's stateof NM gets the most money back fro mthe Fed,
&gt;almost two to 1. He's the Republican use dto be head fo the budget
&gt;committee, bu hsi state is the poorest and is ranked 53 out of 54 in
&gt;terms of education. So obviously Fed grants don't make the economy,
&gt;but havin education (or not having it) does, sice MA is third and
&gt;welathy while his last on both respects.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, Israel is quite socialized, as is Japan and most other western
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nations. It's wh ytheir standard of living is better than ours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Consider the homogeneous nature of their &quot;social&quot; structure and
genetic
&gt;&gt;pool
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and you will have a good idea of why socialization, to the extent
&gt;&gt;practiced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(which is not a top-down-organized affair as much as the statist,
planned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;socialist empires have been), has had aspects that sem to work there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But you jsut contradicted yourself. Israel has jews from al lover the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world, black, chinese, sephardic and ashkenzic. Their is not specifc
&gt;&gt;&gt; gene pool like you mentioned, nor even do they agree ontheir versions
&gt;&gt;&gt; of judaism anfd the resultant cultures either.

&gt;&gt;It is a &quot;Jewish&quot; state; to the extent that it remains so (one of the
major
&gt;&gt;contentions in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the &quot;right of
return&quot;),
&gt;&gt;determines the social structure.

&gt; That's just like the White Supremacists

&gt; It's an assertion, a belief, jus like religion. You might put faith
&gt; into it and make it real for you, but that doesn't make it right.

&gt; Social structure there includes some
&gt;&gt;economic elements. But not the enforced redistributionist, statis,
&gt;&gt;top-down-planned mechnisms ala The soviet Union or China in the last
&gt;&gt;century.

&gt; It happens the same way. I know that as I knew people in Hilel who
&gt; went to Israel. It's a socialist state. They have welfare, and state
&gt; regulation of everything.

&gt; The zionist movement is not necessarily religious i nnature, but it
&gt; was scoialist, which is where the kibbutzes came from, and the
&gt; collectives for farming even inPoland B4 they left.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true of MA. Growing up, I had a neighbor who was black,
&gt;&gt;&gt; wife white, another neighbor who was white wife Filipino, chinese,
&gt;&gt;&gt; irish, korean, and japanese neighbors. There was no racial or cultural
&gt;&gt;&gt; homogeneity at all.

&gt;&gt;That is the point!

&gt; But there was a cultural homegeneity as to economic ideals and

"/> What is self-monitoring about it is that if you produce a bad product, you

&gt; weren't selfish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; you also seem to be confusing communism and socialism.

&gt;&gt;No shit! One is a form of government the other a form of economic
&gt;&gt;organization. However, socialistic tendencies in government almost
always
&gt;&gt;breed a communistic approach to distribution of GDP.

&gt; Since comunism is political, that would be impossible. Socialism

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;he doesn't seem to realize is that if you behave as though there's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an endless supply and give everyone more, the end result is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone's money is worth less.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I am jsut not silly enough to think h economic system actually
&gt;&gt;&gt; works, and people get what they deserve. I knwo when you pay workers
&gt;&gt;&gt; more, they spend more, whic hincreases the economy.

&gt;&gt;But there isn't an endless supply of goods either. If everyone has
&gt;&gt;more money and is competing to buy the same goods, prices will
&gt;&gt;increase.

&gt; not so, due to returns to scale. The larger theeconomy is, the less it
&gt; costs incremenetally to make another product.

"/> Are you trying to talk about economies of scale? Yes, for some products
under some circumstances, it may cost less per item to make more. But
that does not apply to all goods, and certainly not to all services.
Furthermore, even in cases when it does apply, you can't instantaneously
quintuple your production of widgets, and it may require an initial
investement to expand your operations. In the meantime, people will be
competing to buy your existing widgets, and it would only make sense to
raise the price. Also keep in mind that sellers don't always raise
prices because they have to due to production costs - they often do it
simply because they can.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although products are scarce, that is only relatively so.

"/> Yes. It's relative. So if more people had more money and wanted to buy
more goods, they'd be relatively scarcer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To make more
&gt; doesn't really cost as much-case in point, music CD's. Back in in1995,
&gt; it cost only 50 cents per cd, for marketing, shipping, royalties, etc.
&gt; So once more is mad,e it's not like anyone is really &quot;competing&quot; to
&gt; get the goods, since there are sales al lthe time. Right now,
&gt; nationwide, supply exceeds demand. But prices aren't dropping enough
&gt; to take u pthe slack. To increase the demand and reduce supply, we'd
&gt; need more jobs doing anything to give more money to workers to
&gt; stimulate the economy.

"/> But not everything is as easy to make as CDs. How would your theory

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; When their wages

&gt;&gt;Or maybe wages stagnate when the economy stagnates.

&gt; Since people buy things with money, they have to get paid first. Wages
&gt; stagnate, then the economy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since China is an entirely different, ancient, type of culture, their

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the predictable next step for Komrade MuppetMan is to claim that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the extent that Isreal is socialized, non-Jewish Palestinians are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not entitled to the same consideration for social services.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They are not considered Isareali citizens, so they don't get the

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, spend my own. BD Lo Dose syringes, 1/3 cc, box of 100, 28 gauge

&gt;&gt;Waaaaah! How many doses of insulin do you take per day? And who pays
&gt;&gt;for the insulin? Just curious.

&gt;Depends. Usually I take 12 U in the morning and night, and a shot for
&gt;each meal, on a sliding scale of regular, usually 15g=1 u of R. So it
&gt;depends on my BG''s, how much I eat, and whther I'm lifting or sick.

&gt;I pay for the insulin, and the strips. I don't have enough money for a

Michigan, where, I presume, you didn't have a job, so that she could
be with her dying dad and stepdad, and now that dad and stepdad are
dead, you can't afford to move back to Massachusetts, right?

And now you're bitching because the government isn't collecting more
taxes from the rest of us to help resolve the situation in which
you've put yourself?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Section 7 of Bally's contract states that if you RELOCATE 25 miles

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bally's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UNTIL I tried to cancel my contract while I was deployed. The

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're in Texas, home to our current pres. and a very conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place. I'd write the local paper and tel lthem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't believe they are such money grubbing freaks they would do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How low can you go?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They said that there was no way that I could cancel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the contract since I wasn't technically MOVING to Iraq. WHAT THE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HELL?! I have orders that put me in Iraq for an indefinite time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;frame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(yes, soldiers get their tours extended all the friggin time). I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bally's in Baghdad, Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe a torture chamber, but that's a different kind of &quot;rack&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, that lying two-faced sales
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;representative at Bally's verbally stated that all I had to do was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;show my orders moving me from San Antonio and it would be that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;easy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get out of my contract. He lied!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welcome to unregulated capitalism. Please bend over. Free grease
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your rear in the men's room.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The situation has ZIPPO to do with &quot;unregulated capitalism&quot; moron!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It has to do with Bally's:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- not living up to their word/contract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- OP not being aware of possible redress (talk to Bally's corporate,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that letter to local paper, talk to congressional rep, cancel the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself for breach after talking to a lawyer, getting the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;army/reserves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involved, etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;MuppetMan would have us all working out in government-regulated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fitness collectives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, I'd have laws passed so no one or group or corp could own more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 10, and no possibility for franchising. I'd also call for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gov't to pay for memberships or after-school programs for kids, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the presidential fitness award would be funded with money to provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for people to work towards fitness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Would there be any money left for us to eat on after you took eeverything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out to pay for all your fantasy do gooder programs?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure. Look at MA. The state has a lower unemployment rate than the US,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; higher standard of living, and all those after-school programs I'vem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entioned. Not only do they have enough money to eat, they have money
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to run businesses too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They also have Ted Kennedy. The largesse of Kennedy's body is matched only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by the largesse he steals from the rest of the country in federal grants and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;subsidies for those programs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Which stilldon't make upfor the majority of the spending there, BTW.
&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, Sen Domenici's stateof NM gets the most money back fro mthe Fed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;almost two to 1. He's the Republican use dto be head fo the budget
&gt;&gt;&gt;committee, bu hsi state is the poorest and is ranked 53 out of 54 in
&gt;&gt;&gt;terms of education. So obviously Fed grants don't make the economy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but havin education (or not having it) does, sice MA is third and
&gt;&gt;&gt;welathy while his last on both respects.

&gt;&gt;Can you name the 51st, 52nd, 53rd and 54th states?

&gt;Gotcha. WE also have territories. The only one lower than that is
&gt;Guam.

"/> And I quote, &quot;He's the Republican use dto be head fo the budget

Also, even if you count territories and possesions (and DC), the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fortunate that you're not in charge, Komrade.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW, my community YMCA has a great after-school program for kids,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which functions quite nicely without your vision of compelled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; socialism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since China is an entirely different, ancient, type of culture, their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;communism&quot; really isn't, so all that's left of an amazingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;short-lived governmental philosophy is that silly old man in Cuba. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the diehards die hard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not advocating communism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, Israel is quite socialized, as is Japan and most other western
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nations. It's wh ytheir standard of living is better than ours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Consider the homogeneous nature of their &quot;social&quot; structure and genetic pool
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and you will have a good idea of why socialization, to the extent practiced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(which is not a top-down-organized affair as much as the statist, planned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;socialist empires have been), has had aspects that sem to work there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the predictable next step for Komrade MuppetMan is to claim that,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the extent that Isreal is socialized, non-Jewish Palestinians are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not entitled to the same consideration for social services.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are not considered Isareali citizens, so they don't get the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fruits of their labor, just like msot Americans don't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think Komrade MuppetMan is supported by his parents, and thus, he is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;quite enamored with the idea of spending other people's money for his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;social ideals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, spend my own. BD Lo Dose syringes, 1/3 cc, box of 100, 28 gauge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cost me 21- thsi past weekend too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Waaaaah! How many doses of insulin do you take per day? And who pays
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for the insulin? Just curious.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Depends. Usually I take 12 U in the morning and night, and a shot for
&gt;&gt;&gt;each meal, on a sliding scale of regular, usually 15g=1 u of R. So it
&gt;&gt;&gt;depends on my BG''s, how much I eat, and whther I'm lifting or sick.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I pay for the insulin, and the strips. I don't have enough money for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dr., so I don't have one. I pay for it all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been unable in the past ot get meds or a Rx for my thyroid,
&gt;&gt;&gt;which was my Grandmother's problem and what aused her death. Hopefully
&gt;&gt;&gt;that won't happen to me.

&gt;&gt;Mmmmkay. So despite all this, you decided to assume responsibility
&gt;&gt;for your fianceé and her four kids, and then you moved everyone to
&gt;&gt;Michigan, where, I presume, you didn't have a job, so that she could
&gt;&gt;be with her dying dad and stepdad, and now that dad and stepdad are
&gt;&gt;dead, you can't afford to move back to Massachusetts, right?

&gt;Actually, I haven' found any jobs inany state I've lived in, and
&gt;that's mainly due to the economy.

&gt;Assuming responsibilit like that is what men are supposed to do.

"/> One assumes responsibility for what one can handle. One should not

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Screw it. You obviously aren't in the military. It would be nice if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some people showed some support for soldiers. Bally's doesn't and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neither do you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't understand why the fact that you're military gives you extra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;rights&quot;? If I were in a corporate career, been asked to work on a deal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overseas (nevermind if it's Iraq or anywhere else), and went, I'd expect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bally's to treat me the same way as you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have a choice though. Being as he joined the military, he
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't-the government quite literally owns you and he can't quit his
&gt;&gt;&gt; job or leave, nor can he choose his deployment. Thats where GI Joe
&gt;&gt;&gt; comes from-Government Issue Joe. He's owned by the government, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; not a choice.

&gt;&gt;There is no conscription in the U.S. His choice to join the army was his
&gt;&gt;own.

&gt; But Bally's contract says if he moves it's to be cancelled. He is
&gt; moving, so it ought to be. He also doesn't have the choice once he has
&gt; joined the National Guard, unlike a normal job.

&gt; Someone has to do the Nat'l Guard stuff, otherwise you and I wouldn't
&gt; exist. There's no reason why Bally's can't let him out of the
&gt; contract, at leastuntil he gets back.

"/> Agreed, since the arrangement was from the beginning to be able to
cancel should this sitch arise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree that since you were *told* that you could cancel if you moved,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you should certainly be allowed to, but this has nothing to do with you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being in the military.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure it does.

&gt;&gt;How so?

&gt; Only the military doesn't give you a choice afterwards. Any other job
&gt; you can give two weeks if life gives you problems. You can't do that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you can't use while fighting for the U.S. in Iraq then sign your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Signing your life away = signing on with Bally's on a 3 year contract??!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd say that signing your life away = going to Iraq, but that's just my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opinion...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Enjoy your tour in Iraq, fighting for freedom (such as that which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Bally's has given you&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the risks inherent inwhat he's doing and he's doing it for you,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you ought to have a little more respect.

&gt;&gt;Please explain to me what he's doing for me?

&gt; He signed up to defend you and your country, including it's economic
&gt; interests, while over there. Unless you want to have 3$ a gallon gas,
&gt; 25% unemployment, and no control over your country's economic assets
&gt; then you will have to have people like him.

"/> That's a bit broad -- that's more of &quot;foreign policy's mandate&quot; than
military specific (granted, the military is a part of foreign policy).
My comment was geared more towards the specific Iraq mission, and was
not commenting on broader American foreign policy.

&gt; As far as I remember it,

&gt; wants to die. It doesn't justify the monkey shining going on with our
&gt; president or the oil companies either, but it doesn't make him wrong
&gt; to want to sign up and defend i all, even if what he is defending is
&gt; flawed.

&gt; He's willing to dedicate himself to our system evne to the point of
&gt; death and dumb poilitical manuevers. He should be given credit for

"/> I agree with most of what you say here, except that &quot;credit should be

to Iraq.

"/> Yes - an economy that determines, in the large, an efficient use of
resources. That is the driver behind outsourcing to offshore - less cost
means less resources used (the resources of the company).

Provides more bottom line black, which is distributed to employees,
expansion, dividends, stock price (most people own stocks) and pays down
bonds (again to investors).

Most any complex system (a macro-economic system composed of countless
micro-economic subsystems all in feed-back/feed-forward relationships with
each other and with the macro-economy) is likely to experience anomalies
that skew, operationally, that ostensively-ideal capitalistic scenario. The
market *and* government provide necessary feedback to those anomalies as
well, however. From inferior products that are rejected in the marketplace,
to asshole corporate executives that countenance fraud and other
malfeasance.

One needs to look at the economies of the world in the long run to make a
definitive critique of the relative merits and demerits of systems. Else one
is apt to focus on temporary anomalies. Case in point, corporate
malfeasance is in the headlines.

But the bigger story is that capitalism, together with some sort of
representative government (read FREEDOM TO CHOOSE), *has* raised more boats
(country boats and individual boats) than any other combination of
government and economic_system in history.

&gt; Prove it. I knwo you can't. Al lthe highly innovative countries and
&gt; companies are not Americans, but all do come fromsocialist countries.

"/> Poor example. Back in the 70's, the Japanese had major quality
problems. When Deming (an American, I believe) pitched his
quality improvement stuff to American companies, they felt that
they were at the top and had no reason to change operationally.
Since the Japanese were at the bottom, they could see a major
gain by changing their organizational culture, and were willing to
do so. How socialist they were/are is irrelevant. One of the
major problems American companies have/had making the same
changes was persuading the Unions that such changes were
necessary (payment for the production line's accomplishment
instead of piece rate; employees needed to be multi-skilled; etc.)

This was, unfortunately, exacerbated by managment's tendency to
do things like give themselves big bonuses and then go to the Unions
and say that the company would go broke if the Union didn't give in.
(If I recall, the major car companies did just that. I think the steel
companies did, as well.) For some funny reason, the unions got
very obstructive when that happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He signed up to defend you and your country, including it's economic

&gt;&gt;&gt; 25% unemployment, and no control over your country's economic assets

&gt; Additionally, that lying two-faced sales

&gt; get out of my contract. He lied!

"/>&lt;snipped&gt;

Sounds like you've got a mess on your hands, but it's quite workable.

First of all, write down everything as diplomatically as possible. Make sure
you lay it out chronologically, then outline your problems and possible
solutions. Also make a distinct statement about the verbal agreement (i.e.
contract) between you and that 'tard salesman regarding possible deployment
and contract cancellation.

Also, consider alternatives to contract cancellation. Pro-rating for lost
time, suspending your contract until 30 days after you permanently return
from deployment, transfer to another individual, etc.

Next, contact the JAG. Yeah, they're military and usually don't get involved
with military-civilian matters. However, what you're dealing with falls
under the Soldiers &amp; Sailors Civil Relief Act. Even an enlisted paralegal
could whip this together.

Then, with your statement and the relevant quotes from the SSCRA, send out
two copies with a cover letter. One to the Bally's in question, one to their
district manager. Let them know that if the situation isn't resolved
satisfactorily, your next step will be the media, who will receive copies of
all correspondence to date. If you really want to have fun and know a couple
of guys, have the MP's hand-deliver it to the local Bally's. Big
mean-looking guys in BDU's &amp; berets asking for the manager should up the
intimidation factor for Bally's.

If it comes down to using the media, also consider organizing a boycott of
Bally's. Yeah, I know - you're not in town. Have one of your buddies do it,
but using your name. &quot;Troops for Terry&quot;, etc. - cheesy, but the public and
media will lap it up, which is what you want. 30 GI's in uniform with picket
signs and your photo standing in front of that Bally's - absolute
tear-jerker. Major sympathy for a deployed soldier fighting against a
heartless and unpatriotic major corporation. That alone should send Bally's
into a frenzy - they'll cancel your contract, give you a 10 year membership
for free, and put your firstborn through college.

If that doesn't work, sue 'em for breach of contract - as in that lying
salesman formed a contract on Bally's behalf, yet Bally's won't honor it.
Make sure your lawyers know there are deep pockets involved. They foam at
the mouth for that sort of thing.

Good luck to you, and let us know how it works out.

it, you have to pay for it, you can't sell it, you can't return it,
give it away, or loan it to a friend. There are NO excuses - no
reasons why you cannot or should not pay for what you bought: if you
could forsee such a circumstance, you should not have bought it.

In a nutshell: you bought it: pay up, or you're a deadbeat &amp; they
will hound you forever...and take delight in wrecking your credit
rating ('cause deadbeats deserve nothing at all - except a pair o'
broken legs.

As for whether or not the salesperson lied: that's their JOB!
Say/do/promise whatever is necessary to get the contract signed; once
it's signed, it supercedes any &amp; all verbal agreements - it says so in
the contract...what, you didn't read it? You believed them when they
said it was just boiler-plate?

Terry, I'm NOT being tough on you, believe me. You need to know the
enemy to be effective - I just want you to know how they think. Yes,
my comments are based on experience w/ a pre-Bally operation, but I
think it's fair to say that what I'm telling you has *not* been
replaced by a 'kinder, gentler' business model.

Bottom line is the bottom line: they'll do what's necessary to protect
their revenue stream; so embarrassment, public humiliation, bad PR are
your best weapons.

If it were me, I'd get as many from my unit as I could to dress out &amp;
accompany me to file a written complaint @ the club along with a
verbal: polite, calm, but LOUD and CLEAR (and I mean so everyone in
the club can hear me - draw a crowd) that their patriotism is in
question, that they could be facing a nationwide boycott by service
personnel &amp; their families - the whole nine yards. Ask the manager if
s/he is willing to put Bally's in the cross-hairs.

Legally, they don't have to give you dick: if these contracts could be
broken in court, they'd have been by now. The law enforces private
contracts: it doesn't judge them. Your job is to make them want to do
it your way.

A discreet a/v record of the event could come in handy AS LONG AS you
keep your head &amp; keep it civil. Better yet, tell the local TV
&quot;consumer advocate&quot; what when where &amp; why, and let your senators'
offices know, too.

May you and all your fellows make it back home, safe and sound!

P.S. : *** IAMNAL ***

--
They put Jesus on a cross, put a hole in JFK,
They put Hitler in the driver's seat &amp; looked the other way;
Now there's poison in the water, the whole world's in a trance -
But just because we're hypnotised, that don't mean we can't dance!
