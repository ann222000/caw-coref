<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well I had a major billing problem back in early October with Alltel, I
&gt; feared my cell number of 12 years could get lost in the hassle and its my
&gt; life line, I am a tax accountant in Michigan.  So I ported to Sprint,
&gt; since then I have gone back and forth on roaming charges, though I took
&gt; the unlimited call plan for 199.  First they said I had free than no, and
&gt; this went back and forth In October they said it would be put in my notes
&gt; and never have roaming again....well I looked at usage today and yep
&gt; roaming came back up, even though the description says no roaming
&gt; charges...complained to Sprint, and someone removed it from the web on my
&gt; account, they said sorry but you are in an off network state....then a guy
&gt; called back from corporate and said they added 200mins for 20 bucks and he
&gt; was giving me a 10% discount on my bill for one year...I said thanks went
&gt; and checked it out, and they moved my contract from October to today and
&gt; started the 2 years all over again.....I think this is crazy....Well
&gt; Alltel called me today and said they went over our hassle and would be
&gt; giving me a 2300.00 credit to my account if I put all my seven phones
&gt; back..There were 3 on the account, and 3 in my wifes name (former ones
&gt; from account), I said move them back....they then said we will give you a
&gt; new 700p Treo (like the one I have from Sprint) for free if I port my
&gt; number back....they said out of courtesy they already sent it overnight so
&gt; I would have it by the weekend because my new billing cycle with Sprint
&gt; starts Tuesday.  So I have till tomorrow morning to make a decision.  I
&gt; went through what would happen if I kept one with Sprint and rest with
&gt; Alltel, and I would pay about 400.00 more a year, then if I went back, not
&gt; including the free phone, no roaming, and Circle Friends.  So I probably
&gt; should move everything back with Alltel, and then argue with Sprint on the
&gt; cancellation fee.  They are the one, I have it documented btw, that I was
&gt; suppose to get free roaming. What do you all think?

I think that, having chosen to enter into a contract with Sprint, and by not
canceling within the first 15 days, you are obligated to pay an Early
Termination Fee if you port your numbers over to Alltel.

There is something troubling about the way you seem to use number porting to
play one carrier against the other.

First you had a billing dispute with Alltel, so you port your number to
Sprint before Alltel froze it for non-payment.  Now you have a billing
dispute with Sprint and you are about to pull another switcheroo, this time
by porting your number away from Sprint, before Sprint freezes your number.

Sprint does not offer free roaming to customers that live in areas not on
the Sprint network.  Roaming is for occasional use, and is offered as a
courtesy, not as a means of giving you access to another network full-time,
while Sprint picks up the tab.

My advice is that you clean up your act and stop trying to get something for
nothing.  If you leave Sprint, prepare to pay the ETF--but I predict that
you'll drum up additional disputes with your new carrier in short order.

&gt; actually you don't have a clue.....I have a corp account with alltel, I
&gt; was considering moving to Sprint....when a major snafu took place with
&gt; alltel, I ported one number to Sprint to test its waters, I needed an
&gt; unlimited plan cause I use about 8500 mins a month and about 3000 text
&gt; messages....my billing dispute was discovered by an Alltel rep not me, the
&gt; reason the other numbers where not ported was because they were on a
&gt; contract.  I have a copy of notes entered in Sprint account on the second
&gt; day of service, saying the rep made a misrepresentation and I was to recv
&gt; no roaming charges....in the beginning of this month someone removed those
&gt; notes, but I still have a copy because I made sure when I had the
&gt; dispute...I was going to cancel in the 2nd day until they agreed on the
&gt; roaming...well now we are back to square one and by coincidence Alltel
&gt; fixed their bill problem and wanted to woo all eight of my phones back to
&gt; a corp account...I have 4 there right now....I told them I got the phone
&gt; from Sprint for free, they said they would match....and since Sprint did
&gt; not follow through on their promise I am sure I have grounds to get the
&gt; termination fee waived, think about it, even if I couldnt I save 700 bucks
&gt; a year with Alltel with better coverage and no roaming, I could pay the
&gt; 200 and still be ahead of the game and a Sprint phone to sell. You jeremy
&gt; needs to go scratch your ass and put two and two together...are you made
&gt; cause you didnt get a deal???? its trolls like you I would shit out....

Guys like you are a dime a dozen.  You want to get something for nothing,
and you trump up all sorts of baseless complaints about your vendors.
"Sprint did not follow through,"  "I am sure I have grounds to get the
termination fee waived."

And then you come onto a USENET group, and whine about the bum deal you got,
because you couldn't get free roaming from Sprint!  What are you looking
for--a shoulder to cry on?  Forget it, man.  You're just another deadbeat,
trying to justify his own breach-of-contract.

As for your calling me a troll and suggesting that I scratch my ass, that
speaks volumes about the kind of nut you are.

You asked for advice and I gave it: EITHER STAY WITH SPRINT OR PAY
TERMINATION FEES.  Frankly, I think that Sprint would be content to see you
hit the road.  I know I would.

And my reponse is:

If you're such a know-it-all, why are you posting messages asking for
"advice" from complete strangers, whose knowledge and experience is unknown?
In fact, why ask for advice at all?  You're the all-knowing one . . .

&gt; Why should I pay 199 for an unlimited plan and someone else pay the same

My response is:

Because you're probably broke and can't afford wireless service, just like
all the other self-ordained experts out there.  Big mouths and empty bank
accounts.

My response is:

You are free to offer your business to whomever you want, but don't give us
that BS about getting away without paying the ETF.  That is why you will
port your numbers over without warning--so Sprint is not able to put a
freeze on them.

You just want something for nothing.  Get a life, and stop looking for
sympathy.  You're just another deadbeat who thinks he's smarter than the
rest of us.  You made a deal, you later found something that was better, and
now you want to walk away from your current contractual obligation to pay an
ETF.

Dump Sprint.  You'll be placed for collection, just like all the other
smartasses that think they can get away with not honoring their contracts.

If this is what happened, that would be reason enough for me to leave

That seems to be the Sprint way of doing business.  Customre calls
with a complaint right after signing up, and they stall until the 15
days are over, and then won't cancel without the ETF, even though a
complaint was registered.

I'm not just going from jjim's experience.  A few years ago, I signed
up for Sprint.  Got the phone home, no PCS reception, but I could
roam.  Complained, and was told that Sprint had just entered the area
(they had) and that a tower would be coming online "any day now"  A
week later still no PCS reception,   I probably should have cancelled
right then and there, but I believed them, and before I knew it (my
fault, should have kept a better eye on things) a couple of weeks had
gone by, no tower, and can't cancel.  After about a half dozen calls
to Sprint, all I wanted was, if their promised tower wasn't going
online, to get free roaming until their tower went online, as I was
paying for non-roaming PCS service and didn't get it, but was racking
up roaming charges.   Long story short, they erased the roaming
charges from that day back, but wouldn't do anything about future
calling. They also wouldn't cancel my contract for non-service, as
they claimed I was getting service, albeit roaming.  So their idea of
service and mine differed, I was paying for PCS but getting the
priveledge of using their network to roam and rack up charges.   I
paid the ETF as it was less than the charges I racked up in roaming
from my own house.  Went to Verizon and haven't looked back (well,
actually, I have looked back, my Verizon contract is almost up, so I'm
reading the Sprint newsgroup to see what the waters are like these
days. It looks like not much has changed, and the service surveys are
on the mark.  I think I'll stay with Verizon.)

Paul

PS  It was a full year before that tower came online.
