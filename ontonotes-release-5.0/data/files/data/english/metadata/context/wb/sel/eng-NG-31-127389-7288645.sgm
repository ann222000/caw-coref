Hi Readers

Analyst discovers that today's employee will no longer have the same
lifetime job security as it was some year back! They are more
frequently moving between jobs.Why this inclined behaviour towards
doing jobs for shorter periods? Is this because of increased and
refined competition? Technology advancement and its penetration in
every vocation? Employees do face many concerns and thus look forward
when screening a job offer. It could be the bundle of questions in
their mind;

1. Am I going to a good place to work?
2. Are there chances for growth?
3. Is the remuneration fair?
4. What other good benefits?

A candidate should design a measuring tool for evaluating job offers,
whether its a career inception or intending a career switch.
Information about the company can help you to make a decision whether
it is a desirable place for work. Other factors to think contain the
company routine work, economic condition, age, size & location. You
generally gather this type of info via different resources "internet,
annual reports released by stock exchange or word of mouth". Though,
the more you excavate facts about the job, before accepting or
rejecting the offer, the chances will be high that you are going for
the right choice.

Other common factors could be;

* Include job physical location
* If the job is another part of the country other then your native. If
yes...
* Then you need to think the price of everything from housing to
transportation
* Your part of responsibilities
* Working hours
* Production & sales targets
* Salary Package

A good job offers with opportunities to learn new skills not only
increase your earnings but also rise to promotions. A few or be short
of openings can diminish interest in the job and result in irritation
and dullness. The truth is that if you at anytime feel if you are
dissatisfied with your job, you can change jobs more easily. Making
career changes later in life is not as difficult as it once was. In
fact, it might be beneficial for you to change jobs.

Cheers!
