Don't worry.  If you don't accept Paypal / credit card payments, you
won't have  to worry about any end-of-auction fees (or packaging
materials, postage, etc).

Then you can't say in your auction listings that you take Paypal
=at all=.  You can't say I'll take Paypal only under certain
conditions. If you &quot;take&quot; Paypal, you have to take all Paypal
payments, including the ones that cost you their trivially small fee.

&gt;I went to link my eBay and PayPal accounts so I could print out shipping
&gt; labels.

&gt; In the info they list all the &quot;pluses&quot; of linking the accounts.

&gt; One of which is &quot;automatically add PayPal logos to your auctions&quot;

&gt; Does anyone know if you can override this when you list an auction???

&gt; I have individual PayPal account and can only accept non-debit/credit
&gt; card payments so I do not want PayPal logo on my auctions that show the
&gt; credit card logos.

&gt; I don't sell enough (or high enough priced items) to justify also paying
&gt; PayPal fees on top of eBay fees.

&gt; Especially right now being I was just laid off from my job (due to
&gt; outsourcing of work to India) and I'm trying to sell a few items to help
&gt; make ends meet.

&gt; I previously used Shipping Assistant on my Mac (using Virtual PC
&gt; software), but since they upgraded Shipping Assistant, it's no longer
&gt; compatible with my system.

&gt; Can't justify (or afford being I'm now unemployed) going out and buying
&gt; a new computer just to be able to print out labels using Shipping
&gt; Assistant.

&gt; So I had hoped to be able to do so via eBay being I noticed that was an
&gt; option.

&gt; Thanks much all and have a great day ! ! !

You either accept ALL PayPal payments, or none at all (according to the
rules which you accepted when you signed up).     It's been that way for
years.

If your stuff isn't worth paying for the services that allow you to
advertise and receive payment for, then your stuff isn't worth selling at
all.

It's that easy.

Let's talk about ethics, you slug.
What does your PayPal user agreement say?
You come here to find out how honest and
ethical sellers can help you cheat PayPal
and therefore those honest sellers.
Brilliant!

It is an optional feature within PayPal which must be
selected via their &quot;Auction Tools&quot; preferences.  It's
a yes/no thang ... you either add the PayPal logo to ALL
of your auctions, or NONE of your auctions.

In other words, you'll be happy to have your auctions bring
lower results so you can &quot;save&quot; the PayPal fee?  I've never
run a formal Experiment, but I'd bet that auctions which accept
PayPal result in higher prices realized than similar auctions
which do NOT accept PayPal.

On a $5 sale, the PayPal fee is around half-a-buck ... on a
$10 sale, it's around seventy centz.  If the lot brings a
buck more with PayPal than it wuddabrung without PayPal,
then you are ahead in the game.

There are a LOT of potential bidders who only bid on auctions
that accept PayPal, so they'll not be bidding on your stuff ...

Same reason you get &quot;double dipped&quot; by both eBay and your
bank. Or eBay and your dentist. Or Chevrolet and Johnson Wax.
Each of them provides a service that you've agreed to. Do
you cheat on your income taxes? Drive drunk? Shoplift?
You've agreed not to do any of those. Do you think it's
simply ok to abide by the rules that you like and disobey
the rules that you don't like?

duh - to maximize the number of potential bidders.

Refusing to accept PP is much like restricting bidding to those only
with a middle name that starts with the letter Q.

Talk about out of touch.   The daily cost of driving to / from the bank
(assuming you understand real costs) to cash all those checks &amp; money
orders will likely surpass one's PP fees, never mind the forgone profits
of refusing PP bidders.

Hint - I transfer my profits electronically.   Endorsing checks is way
too time consuming for me, plus driving around with that much money
would be too concerning for me.

Clueless, eh?

Hint - Quickness of bidding has little-to-nothing to do with the final
price.
