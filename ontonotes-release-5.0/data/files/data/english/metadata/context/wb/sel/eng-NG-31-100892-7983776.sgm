Kant
&quot;I have therefore found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to
make room for faith.&quot;

Are hardly the words of someone claiming not to be a mystic eh?

But according to Knucmo:

Another confusion.  Kant is not a mystic: He does not claim that God
is an object of sensory reality, ever, in fact.

Hmmmm knucmo again:

For any section of reality to become known to us, some sort of
condition has to be the case wherein it can be an object for us.  But
what makes reality into an object for us?  It's mere existence doesn't
establish its being an object for us.

Makes it very hard for Kant to claim what knucmo says he did on the
subject of god.

Slightly different but further dishonesty.

Me:
Man is born tabula rasa, all of your knowledge is learnt.

knucmo responds:
Highly questionable.  An actual blank slate wouldn't perform the work
of the mind so the mind is actually more of a processing machine, and
slates do not process tastes, sounds, smells, touches and visual
data.

Note the desperate dropping of context? I said;

Man is born tabula rasa, all of your knowledge is learnt.

A complete sentence with a clear unambiguous message.

In previous posts and knucmo knows, but his dishonesty becomes more
desperate by the day, I have stated that all of man's knowledge is
gained through the faculty of reason, which I have explained and
defined what I mean by that and therefore, my statement that &quot;man is
born tabular rasa, all of your knowledge is learnt,&quot; obviously means
that I am saying that man is born without any knowledge, which
contradicts Kant's and knucmo's claim that man has innate knowledge of
things like space and time.

Kant was a mystic and so are his followers, make no mistake.

It seems that if certainty cannot be established then all that is left
is faith or the probability of conflicting theories must compete in
the free market of ideas. Again its like your claiming that you can
predict a flip of a coin with certainty, but you must have -faith- in

The Blank Slate - The Modern Denial of Human Nature - Steven Pinker
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/qid=1086630363/
http://alumweb.mit.edu/opendoor/200205/pinker.shtml

PART I - The Blank Slate, the Noble Savage, and the Ghost in the
Machine

Everyone has a theory of human nature. Everyone has to anticipate the
behavior of others, and that means we all need theories about what
makes people tick. A tacit theory of human nature-that behavior is
caused by thoughts and feelings-is embedded in the very way we think
about people. We fill out this theory by introspecting on our own
minds and assuming that our fellows are like ourselves, and by
watching people's behavior and filing away generalizations. We absorb
still other ideas from our intellectual climate: from the expertise of
authorities and the conventional wisdom of the day.

Our theory of human nature is the wellspring of much in our lives. We
consult it when we want to persuade or threaten, inform or deceive. It
advises us on how to nurture our marriages, bring up our children, and
control our own behavior. Its assumptions about learning drive our
educational policy; its assumptions about motivation drive our
policies on economics, law, and crime. And because it delineates what
people can achieve easily, what they can achieve only with sacrifice
or pain, and what they cannot achieve at all, it affects our values:
what we believe we can reasonably strive for as individuals and as a
society. Rival theories of human nature are entwined in different ways
of life and different political systems, and have been a source of
much conflict over the course of history.

For millennia, the major theories of human nature have come from
religion. The Judeo-Christian tradition, for example, offers
explanations for much of the subject matter now studied by biology and
psychology. Humans are made in the image of God and are unrelated to
animals. Women are derivative of men and destined to be ruled by them.
The mind is an immaterial substance: it has powers possessed by no
purely physical structure, and can continue to exist when the body
dies. The mind is made up of several components, including a moral
sense, an ability to love, a capacity for reason that recognizes
whether an act conforms to ideals of goodness, and a decision faculty
that chooses how to behave. Although the decision faculty is not bound
by the laws of cause and effect, it has an innate tendency to choose
sin. Our cognitive and perceptual faculties work accurately because
God implanted ideals in them that correspond to reality and because he
coordinates their functioning with the outside world. Mental health
comes from recognizing God's purpose, choosing good and repenting sin,
and loving God and one's fellow humans for God's sake.

The Judeo-Christian theory is based on events narrated in the Bible.
We know that the human mind has nothing in common with the minds of
animals because the Bible says that humans were created separately. We
know that the design of women is based on the design of men because in
the second telling of the creation of women Eve was fashioned from the
rib of Adam. Human decisions cannot be the inevitable effects of some
cause, we may surmise, because God held Adam and Eve responsible for
eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, implying that they could
have chosen otherwise. Women are dominated by men as punishment for
Eve's disobedience, and men and women inherit the sinfulness of the
first couple.

The Judeo-Christian conception is still the most popular theory of
human nature in the United States. According to recent polls, 76
percent of Americans believe in the biblical account of creation, 79
percent believe that the miracles in the Bible actually took place, 76
percent believe in angels, the devil, and other immaterial 'souls, 67
percent believe they will exist in some form after their death, and
only 15 percent believe that Darwin's theory of evolution is the best
explanation for the origin of human life on Earth.5 Politicians on the
right embrace the religious theory explicitly, and no mainstream
politician would dare contradict it in public. But the modern sciences
of cosmology, geology, biology, and archaeology have made it
impossible for a scientifically literate person to believe that the
biblical story of creation actually took place. As a result, the Judeo-
Christian theory of human nature is no longer explicitly avowed by
most academics, journalists, social analysts, and other intellectually
engaged people.

Nonetheless, every society must operate with a theory of human nature,
and our intellectual mainstream is committed to another one. The
theory is seldom articulated or overtly embraced, but it lies at the
heart of a vast number of beliefs and policies. Bertrand Russell
wrote, &quot;Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of
comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer
day.&quot; For intellectuals today, many of those convictions are about
psychology and social relations. I will refer to those convictions as
the Blank Slate: the idea that the human mind has no inherent
structure and can be inscribed at will by society or ourselves.

That theory of human nature-namely, that it barely exists-is the topic
of this book. Just as religions contain a theory of human nature, so
theories of human nature take on some of the functions of religion,
and the Blank Slate has become the secular religion of modern
intellectual life. It is seen as a source of values, so the fact that
it is based on a miracle-a complex mind arising out of nothing-is not
held against it. Challenges to the doctrine from skeptics and
scientists have plunged some believers into a crisis of faith and have
led others to mount the kinds of bitter attacks ordinarily aimed at
heretics and infidels. And just as many religious traditions
eventually reconciled themselves to apparent threats from science
(such as the revolutions of Copernicus and Darwin), so, I argue, will
our values survive the demise of the Blank Slate.

The chapters in this part of the book (Part I) are about the
ascendance of the Blank Slate in modern intellectual life, and about
the new view of human nature and culture that is beginning to
challenge it. In succeeding parts we will witness the anxiety evoked
by this challenge (Part II) and see how the anxiety may be assuaged
(Part III). Then I will show how a richer conception of human nature
can provide insight into language, thought, social life, and morality
(Part IV) and how it can clarify controversies on politics, violence,
gender, childrearing, and the arts (Part V). Finally I will show how
the passing of the Blank Slate is less disquieting, and in some ways
less revolutionary, than it first appears (Part VI).

The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a
person's actual position and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or
misrepresented version of that position. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is
fallacious because attacking a distorted version of a position simply
does not constitute an attack on the position itself. One might as
well expect an attack on a poor drawing of a person to hurt the
person.

If you read the postings, you see how quickly those who lack a
rational
response fall back on ad hominum. I dont claim to know how the
memories
in my brain got there. I've read interesting work on how to put
memories
there in what I remember as undergraduate years.

I also remember a patient, lying on a bed, fed with a tube, that had
never,
in his entire life, commited at sin because he made no volitional act.
He
was a genuine bodhisattvah.

I remember Aristotle's Nicomachean ethics, and how what he describes
as
an &quot;evil doer&quot;, he understands what I do as well, that its a case of
mental
pathology, not evil.

Of course, your world may be different. Saint Ramprasad there was a

with
many of them.

Context dropping fuckhead, I cant stand fucking liars
and the days of me being civil to you are fast
coming to an end.

I have said that a tossed coin will land according to
very strict laws of nature specifically physics,
including such information as the weight of coin,
how it rested prior to having forced applied to it, the
amount of force applied to it at initiation of the toss,
facts and laws of gravity, known facts of the environment
etc etc etc, I have said there are no contradictions in reality
and that a tossed coin can NOT act in contradiction of its
nature and will land precisely how those laws determine.

Its chazzzzz and you *uncertanity of everything cock-heads*
who claim its a 50 50 chance and man can never know.

If you had half a fucking clue then you would know that
man has no influence over HOW the coin lands, so why
the fuck make a guess - let alone a bet?

The laws of physics, which determine how a coin lands,
man does understand and he has enough information
and technology to be able to know with absolute
certainty precisely how the coin will land.

The fact that that calculation may currently take longer than
the coin is in the air, does NOT mean there will be
a contradiction in the nature of the physics of the tossed
coin, e.g. to change any result.

It is NOT a fucking 50 50 chance, chance plays no part no
role in the laws of physics, therefore neither
should it in man's claim of knowledge dependent
upon the laws of physics.

For one, from what I read Saint Ramprasad has to say, I have no way
of knowing that there really is a 'there' there, and that everything I
perceive is no more than a data stream from some 3D virtual reality
generator. About 4 terabyes/sec would easily be convincing.

Given what was already written in what appears to be memory. The
Vedas I remember reading, which may or may not exist in the reality
you exist on, come to grips with this issue of a projected reality
system,
which includes projecting the forces that appear to be physical
bodies.
The Levantine scriptures dont have the answers, or even the right
questions.

Not that there could not be a reality system some place with a set
of Levantine scriptures that make sense within the parameters of
that reality.

My memory includes clinical experience and academic training in
psychology
as well as time spent reading classics going all the way back to
Gilgamesh.

Among them is the observation that neurotics are intolerant of
ambiguity,
and therefore quick to jump to conclusions, and angry when those
beliefs
are challenged.

Group think also enters into it. Many are so immersed in Christian
culture,
that even tho they dont accept scripture, they fail to realize
underlying
assumptions dogma is based on. The free will and causation dont do
well
when confronted with the uncertainty principles and chaos theory that
came
out of quantum physics.

&quot;sin&quot; for instance is seen as a result of free will, and the cause of
damnation.
But my memory has the idea that it is, in fact, mental pathology.
Whether
this makes sense where you, or any other reader of this message is, I
have
no way of knowing. YMMV.

As for why, from time to time I receive feedback more interesting than

Well, one may very well accept Kant's metaphysics without accepting

Three problems:

Which is therefore self-contradictory: If man's knowledge is through
reason then it is therefore not tabula rasa, as Locke appreciated, for
reason, the criterion of truth is intellectual and not sensory.  It is
also dogmatical, and assumes (incorrectly) that logical reflection
alone is enough.  There's a simple objection to this: Because
reflection by reason only takes into account the form of concepts,
form alone is insufficient to account for objects, which supply the
content: Therefore, to employ logical reflections to determine the
real nature of things is confusing logical concepts with real
concepts.

Tabula rasa also involves a contradiction: You cannot speak of a
conscious mind that is unexposed and that the a person knows nothing
of the external world as this entails that a person is conscious of
nothing, but being conscious of nothing is not being conscious at all,
according to Rand.

The mind doesn't simply receive knowledge: It (knowledge) doesn't just
pour into the mind like a glass of water; instead, it conforms to our
mode of cognition, and this mode of cognition influences the shape
that such knowledge takes.  There's plenty of evidence which suggests
our minds are hardwired at birth, and this hardwiring underlies things
shared by persons of all shapes and sizes       ; incest avoidance

Nope, I am no mystic, Schopenhauer is no mystic, Cassirer is no

on this outburst of yours; I am not going to encourage your tendency

against USENET posters in separate posts and you can answer my

As an addendum; Rand was an idiot in social matters: she engineered a
marriage between the Brandens and then had a love affair with
Nathaniel, who wasn't too sure about that, as he married after all,
and he refused to continue their affair, Rand expelled Nathaniel.  But
of course, that does not imply that her followers are so disastrous
when it comes to their social lives, whatsoever, in the same way that
(if) Kant was a mystic, then all his followers would be.  Not no way,

I am saying man's senses his eyes ears nose feel touch, first gather

You on the other hand are saying, that knowledge already existed

The criterion of truth is, non-contradictory identification of sensory
data, i.e. that which conforms to reality, reality is not imagined and
therefore neither is the truth.

Reality can not contradict itself without destroying itself.

You can not deny existence without accepting something existing to
deny, i.e. without contradiction.

THEREFORE you have NO CHOICE, but to identify the claimed existents as
what they are. e.g. the total lack of sensory evidence, the truck
loads of contradictions withing the definitions offered, leads the
mind of reason to accept as fact, that, the mystic's god is just an
idea, and as it happens, just an idea of the dopey, sad, lonely,
desperte and often of the fucking evil.

If you dont offer any sensory evidence at all, in a claim of the
truth, then you are leaving the truth to be totally dependent upon the
mind, but its not, the truth is real, reality is not dependent upon
the mind, it just is.

The truth based on a subject and not on an object is in the absense of
sensory reality, only a subject about a subject about a subject,
subjective fucking piffle.

The absolute best that man can ever do is, to identify WITHOUT
CONTRADICTION what it is that, something is claimed to exist as.

You can not even deny the existence of your own ideas, that only
leaves one other option, to identify them and if you want them to be
ideas of reality, then they CAN NOT contain contradiction, wouild you
like me to explain why? or have you worked that out all by yourself?

I am saying, that if someone claims something as true, and offers
absolutely no sensory evidence to back up that claim, then the mind of
reason simply ignores it, or regards it any further at his peril. they
are called totally unsubstaniated arbitrary claims / whims.

God springs to mind, as such a silly NON-SENSE as does the letfist
ilk's the claimed reality of *the greater good* and of course Kant's
version of man's knowledge of space and time Kant INVENTED INSIDE his
mind and therefore the mind of reason ignores, even though it is the
source of great humour.

Even a very dishonest crook can be a little honest every now and then,

You dont find it strange, hypocritical and dishonest how you, albeit
foolishly, claim you have given an example, of reality, that render

Dropping context is changing subject.

Failing to finish a subject and starting another is called dropping
context.

Answering with metaphysics when the question or subject is
epistemology, is called dropping context and therefore is changing
subjects, its dishonest.

Its the worst of dishonesty and the most repugnant of crimes in
debates of philosophy and yet Kantimania can not exist without
answering epistemological questions or statements made, with totally
unsubstaniated contradicting dopey non-sensical arbitrary metaphysical
Kantian regurgitations.

I have said on many occasions, that there are no contradictions in
reality because what is real is real, that a contradiction by
definition does not exist.

Therefore, non-contradictory identification and integration, along
with sensory data, was the only possible standard man could use to
gain any and all of his knowledge of reality - to determine the real
from the imagined, the truth from dishonesty, good from bad, right
from wrong.

I have totaly dismissed and demonstrated, via the use of The Law Of
Identity, that your arbitrary Kantian regurgitations such as &quot;innate
knowledge&quot; is a blatant contradiction, specifically in the use of
concepts.

You came along (as all Kantians eventually do BTW) and claimed to have
an example that rendered non-contradictory identification and
integration as &quot;impotent&quot;, words you used &quot;.......Schrodinger's Cat as
it violates the Law of Non-Contradiction somewhat......&quot;

Other Kantians have used the Zeno crap, the Popper crap and
regurgitated B Russell.

You claimed that the cat crap was a &quot;thought exercise&quot; that rendered
non-contradictory identification and intergration of sensory data as
being impotent as the only means to man's knowledge of reality.

I have stated, that in reality, that in fact it was nothing but an
exercise requiring the complete and total abandoment of any &quot;thought&quot;
as ALL contradictions and claimed paradoxes, require.

You claimed the cat was both alive and dead at the same time and yet
you did not want to define what you meant by being alive and by being
dead, because YOU do KNOW, that in reality, by definition, they can
NOT be both at the same time.

You would not even talk about the reality of how long the cat would
survive in a sealed box without food water fresh air, you did not want
to talk about HOW the experiment could in reality even be put
together, etc etc you were expecting and arrogantly sooo, demanding
those who were applying &quot;thoughts of what they DO know of reality&quot; to
totally abandoned those thoughts, so much for it being a thought
exercise. -

The very principle of &quot;non-contradicting identification of the sensory
evidence&quot;, the evidence that you were presenting, you required to be
abandoned in a pathetic and desperate attempt to make your own THOUGHT-
LESS stupidity make sense.

That has nothing to do with the price of fish (epistemology).

The fact that the mind is hard-wired to identify and integrate into

mind?

Dont be silly, &quot;incest avoidance&quot; is not an innate thing of man's
sensory nature, its learnt, its knowledge.

If it were not for man's faculty of reason, a faculty he must identify
and then must learn to use, if it were not for that faculty, then man
would fuck his sister, his mother and his aunt and make no mistake.

Indeed you can see it happening in the &quot;absense of reason&quot; animal
kingdom, in which man evolves to this very day.

Reason seperates man from the other apes, reason is a faculty you must
identify learn and use, because if and when you dont you'd soon be
back swinging from the trees and living like an ape.

Indeed, you can see exactly that happening in socialist political
parasical societies today, where the need to think (reason) has been
replaced by politcal thuggery stealing and the forced redistribution
of stolen production.

I can take you to hundreds of Maori tribal communities in NZ and
hundreds of outback Australian Aboriginal communities today, where
white man's sickening anti-human disgusting parasitical socialist
culture has totally fucked those communities.

How? With things like state welfare, where reason, the need to think,
has all but gone and where incest is rife, yes fucking rife knucmo,

&gt; he does and if he claims he's right, then before he expects others to

&gt; e.g. Kant's claim that man's knowledge of space and time was given to
&gt; him by the knowledge fairy.

Nope, in the quest of your knowlegde you must demand that each concept
has its own meaning, and for faith to have a meaning all of its own,
then its definition or meaning must be clear and unambiguous.

Faith is the acceptance of an idea without evidence, without any
sensory evidence offered and or considered for the acceptance of that
idea.

And often ideas are accepted on faith in the face of blatant
contradiction, as we see in the definitions of the identity of mystics
god and in the Kantian piffle of how man has his knowledge of space
and time.

Belief is similar to trust, and I believe that belief is the concept
you mean.

Belief is the acceptance of an idea or the acceptance of a part of an
idea e.g. a prediction, based on at least some sensory and non-
contradicting evidence presented and proved and or observed in the
past.

As usual, the not very bright Kantian Mal Sparky wishes (because he's
not capable of thinking) that man has knowledge of things like space,
time, ants and slugs before his senses have sensed them, weird
boneheads them Kantians are.

Your changing the meaning of faith that as I was using it. My
definition was closer to confidence or belief in the probable. Are you
saying that we should retract the term faith from the conversation? If
so I don't mind as long as you continue to concede that certanty if
probably an illusory goal.

You have equivicated me with the four term fallacy;

Fallacy of four terms

The fallacy of four terms (Latin: quaternio terminorum) is the logical
fallacy that occurs when a categorical syllogism has four terms.

Valid categorical syllogisms always have three terms:

Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All goldfish have fins.

Here, the three terms are: &quot;goldfish,&quot; &quot;fish,&quot; and &quot;fins.&quot;

Using four terms invalidates the syllogism:

Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All humans have fins.

The premises don't connect &quot;humans&quot; with &quot;fins&quot;, so the reasoning is
invalid. Notice that there are four terms: &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;fins&quot;, &quot;goldfish&quot;
and &quot;humans&quot;. Two premises aren't enough to connect four different
terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term
common to both premises.

In everyday reasoning, the fallacy of four terms occurs most
frequently by equivocation: using the same word or phrase but with a
different meaning each time, creating a fourth term even though only
three distinct words are used:

Major premise: Nothing is better
than complete happiness.
Minor premise: A ham sandwich is
better than nothing.
Conclusion: A ham sandwich is better
than complete happiness.

The fallacy of four terms is a syllogistic fallacy. Types of syllogism
to which it applies include statistical syllogism, hypothetical
syllogism and categorical syllogism, all of which must have exactly
three terms.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms
http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/four_fall.html

Equivocation is a logical fallacy. It is committed when someone uses
the same word in different meanings in an argument, implying that the
word means the same each time around.

For example:

1. A feather is light.
2. What is light cannot be dark.

Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

The above argument commits this fallacy: The word &quot;light&quot; is used in
the sense of &quot;having little weight&quot; the first time, but of &quot;bright&quot;
the second time. This fallacy becomes obvious as soon as one tries to
translate this argument into another language. Since the middle term
in this syllogism is actually two different terms, equivocation is
actually a kind of the fallacy of four terms.

The fallacy of equivocation is often used with words that have a
strong emotional content and many meanings. These meanings often
coincide within proper context, but the fallacious arguer does a
semantic shift, slowly changing the context as they go in such a way
to achieve equivocation by equating distinct meanings of the word.

In English language, one equivocation is with the word &quot;man&quot;, which
can mean both &quot;member of species Homo sapiens&quot; and &quot;male member of
species Homo sapiens&quot;. A well-known equivocation is

&quot;Do women need to worry about man-eating sharks?&quot;
where &quot;man-eating&quot; is taken as &quot;devouring only male human beings&quot;.

A separate case of equivocation is metaphor:

1. A Jackass is a male member
of the species Equus asinus
2. All Jackasses have long ears
3. Karl is a jackass

Therefore, Karl has long ears

Here the equivocation is the metaphorical use of &quot;jackass&quot; to imply a
stupid or obnoxious person instead of a male ass.

Equivocation is closely linked with the fallacy of amphiboly.

I prefer this.

http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Metaphysics_Identity.html

A is A: Aristotle's Law of Identity
Everything that exists has a specific nature. Each entity exists as
something in particular and it has characteristics that are a part of
what it is. &quot;This leaf is red, solid, dry, rough, and flammable.&quot;
&quot;This book is white, and has 312 pages.&quot; &quot;This coin is round, dense,
smooth, and has a picture on it.&quot; In all three of these cases we are
referring to an entity with a specific identity; the particular type
of identity, or the trait discussed, is not important. Their
identities include all of their features, not just those mentioned.

Identity is the concept that refers to this aspect of existence; the
aspect of existing as something in particular, with specific
characteristics. An entity without an identity cannot exist because it
would be nothing. To exist is to exist as something, and that means to
exist with a particular identity.

To have an identity means to have a single identity; an object cannot
have two identities. A tree cannot be a telephone, and a dog cannot be
a cat. Each entity exists as something specific, its identity is
particular, and it cannot exist as something else. An entity can have
more than one characteristic, but any characteristic it has is a part
of its identity. A car can be both blue and red, but not at the same
time or not in the same respect. Whatever portion is blue cannot be
red at the same time, in the same way. Half the car can be red, and
the other half blue. But the whole car can't be both red and blue.
These two traits, blue and red, each have single, particular
identities.

The concept of identity is important because it makes explicit that
reality has a definite nature. Since reality has an identity, it is
knowable. Since it exists in a particular way, it has no
contradictions.

That's what Objectivists do. In order to strengthen their arguments,
thus their own faith, they have to twist and mangle the reality that
other people are trying to express, such as in this case the reality
that the term 'faith' has multiple meanings.

Thats what Kantians do, they claim that reality can never be
experienced, because it always hidden from them and yet they appeal to
it so desperately when they need to make a point, as siily as the
point is.
