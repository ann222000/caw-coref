I facepainted with UV, and did glitter and temporary tattoos at an all age outdoor Music Festival Sat afternoon and night. It was very small ( first time event) and in order to have power we were placed to the side of the stage,so a couple of people who knew I was going to be there couldn't find me. Longer electrical lead next time?????? Great bands though , and there will be more events put on by these people, so it will get bigger. All up we probably decorated Â 40 or so people.

Today my Brazillian partner and I clowned at childrens party for a Brazillian/Aussie family. I facepainted for 2 hours solid, around 30 children and a few adults, while Francisco played games, twisted balloons, played pass the parcel, lolly treasure hunt and whacked a Piniata. He also drummed as they loudly sang Happy Birthday in English and Portugese! They loved it and 3 people said they will call us for their childrens parties, as well as for a Brazillian childrens fun day they are planning in October.
Lovely people, and a pleasure to be there!
