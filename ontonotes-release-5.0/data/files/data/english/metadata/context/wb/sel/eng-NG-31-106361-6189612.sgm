Beware GARDASIL
by Helen Lobato

Gardasil is the new vaccine being intensely marketed to the parents of young
girls from the age of nine. The vaccine is said to protect against two
strains of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), which it is believed, cause
about 70 per cent of cervical cancers. However there are many facts
concerning this form of cancer that are not being presented to the now
fearful public.

Recently the alarm bells have been ringing about the risks of dying from
Cervical cancer. But HPV, the virus that is blamed for this disease is very
common and can be found in about 80% of both men and women. Most of us have
had, at one time or another, the HPV virus but most of us do not suffer or
die from Cervical cancer. In fact, only one percent of women do develop
cervical cancer with the year 2000 figures on the mortality rates for
cervical cancer being 3.3 women per 100,000 population in the US and 4 women
per 100,000 population in Australia. In Australia there are about 740 cases
of cervical cancer each year and around 270 deaths from the disease.
Mortality rates generally increase with age with the highest number of
deaths occurring in the 75-79 age group.
Less than 6 per cent of cervical cancer deaths occur in women under 35 years
of age.

The US national cancer institute says that direct causation has not been
proven In a controlled study of age-matched women, 67% of those with
cervical cancer and 43% of those without were found to be HPV-positive.
These cancers are observed on average only 20-50 years after infection. 1

So what is going on?

Does this virus cause cervical cancer?

Nicholas Regush Â wrote in VACCINE MADNESS
Back in 1992, however, a question was raised about the dominant and
increasingly-entrenched theory that HPV causes cervical cancer. It came from
Peter Duesberg and Jody Schwartz, molecular biologists at the University of
California at Berkeley. Among the various issues they raised about the
acceptance of HPV as the cause of cervical cancer was their fundamental
concern that there was a lack of consistent HPV DNA sequences and consistent
HPV gene expression in tumors that were HPV-positive. They instead suggested
that "rare spontaneous or chemically induced chromosome abnormalities which
are consistently observed in HPV DNA-negative and positive cervical cancers
induce cervical cancer."
In short, Duesberg and Schwartz were pointing to the possibility that
"carcinogens may be primary inducers of abnormal cell proliferation rather
than HPV." And here's the key point: "Since proliferating cells [cancer
cells dividing wildly] would be more susceptible to infection than resting
cells, the viruses would just be indicators rather than causes of abnormal
proliferation."2.

This begs the question: Does a virus, any virus cause a cancer?

We now know that cancer results due to a complex mix of factors related to
environment, lifestyle, and heredity. Scientists estimate that about 80
percent of all cancers are related to the use of tobacco products, to what
we eat and drink, or, to a lesser extent, to exposure to radiation or
cancer-causing agents in the environment and the workplace.3

How then have we come to the conclusion that the Human Papilloma Virus
causes cervical cancer?
Maybe the truth lies in what Duesberg and Schwartz discovered. Rather it is
carcinogens not a virus that causes the abnormal cell proliferation.

One would hope and expect that Gardasil has been well tested and is safe to
inject into young girls and possibly boys.
BUT!
According to The Alliance for Human Research Protection (AHRP) this is not
the case. AHRP say that the vaccine has not been proven safe and effective
in clinical trials. The fact is that the FDA allowed Merck to use a
potentially reactive aluminum containing placebo as a control for most trial
participants, rather than a non-reactive saline solution placebo.
They use this aluminum placebo because it can artificially increase the
appearance of safety of an experimental drug or vaccine in a clinical trial.
Furthermore the Gardasil vaccine contains 225 mcg of Aluminum and we know
that vaccine aluminum adjuvants can allow aluminum to enter the brain, as
well as cause inflammation at the injection site leading to chronic joint
and muscle pain and fatigue.
Around 60 percent of those who got Gardasil or the aluminum placebo suffered
side effects such as headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea,
myalgia and the Gardasil recipients had more serious adverse events such as
headache, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease,
asthma, bronchospasm and arthritis.4

So with cervical cancer causing about one percent of all cancer deaths in
women and with the causation in doubt, not to mention the lack of safety
displayed by the vaccine trials we need to ask why parents are being urged
to get their young daughters vaccinated with Gardasil.

The obvious answer it that there is much hanging on the success of Gardasil.
It is predicted that Gardasil could be Merck's most important money earner,
with expected sales of at least $2 billion.This is revenue that Merck badly
needs after the Vioxx scandals. To achieve this success Gardasil will be
required for school admittance.5

How can we remain silent on the issue of Gardasil?

I am a female who has suffered immensely in the past several years due to
this whole cervical cancer scare. I was diagnosed with cervical dysplasia.,
and was mandated to have a LEEP procedure then a cryo. i was NOT given a
choice. i was told i would die of cancer if i did not. what LIES. i assure
you that doctors lie. it is meant to shame women and treat them like they
are stupid whores. what. all for having had sex? these people ruined my
life. if i had known what i know now about cervical dysplasia and all that,
i NEVER would have allowed these people to treat me like a human lab rat. as
for now, i have had all normal pap smears for the past four years. but
wait!!! i tested postive for the HPV! oh no. i have ANTIBODIES to HPV. and
antibodies are a sign of good health. but this is NOT something these
doctors want you to figure out. i had to figure it out on my own. there is
also no woman in my family who has had cervical cancer. and face it, a
retrovirus, such as HPV, simply CANNOT cause cancer. YOUR GENETICS are what
determine if you will get cancer. not a harmless chemical LAB TEST like HPV.
FUCK THE SYSTEM.

Lindsay, I too suffered from the whole scare program re cervical cancer
twenty years ago. Was told i would get cervical cancer and must have my
uterus removed. Sought another opinion and very soon the pap smears became
normal.
It is a scam!
thanks for your comments

Wow. Thanks for this post. I discovered I had HPV nearly ten years ago
through an abnormal pap. Six months later, everything was fine. My doctors'
attitudes have always been that it's no big deal as long as I get my yearly
Pap.

I wish the rest of the world could be this calm in their approach. Instead
it's TV, magazine, Internet ads, fake health articles everywhere from
Guardisal and Digene raising alarm bells. Even Dr. Drew, who once stated on
Loveline that it's safe to say that HPV has completely gone away after 10
years without symptoms, has changed his tune, and now calls it a lifelong
issue.

It makes me sick to my stomach that everyone is cashing in on this
hysteria.

It does seem like an alarmist reaction in the media since Gardasil was
launched. It's nice to see some opinions that aren't so "chicken little" on
the topic!

Please do not trample on this wonderful health care initiative which will
save many lives.

Thankfully we have made scientific progress and as an RN who has nursed
patients with this disease, I applaud the work that has been done.

This wonderful health initiative (as you call it) should not be given to 9
year old girls and possibly boys. Cervical cancer tends to occur in midlife.
Half of women diagnosed with this cancer are between the ages of 35 and 55.
As girls grow older they can be followed by papsmears to prevent this
cancer and death. Women who have never had a Pap test or who have not had
one for several years have a higher than average risk of developing cervical
cancer.

Also it is very important to understand the risks of this vaccine to young
children who are not going to get cervical cancer for many years for as we
know it is older women. As i have previously written at top of this page
around 60 percent of those who got Gardasil or the aluminum placebo suffered
side effects such as headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea,
myalgia and the Gardasil recipients had more serious adverse events such as
headache, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease,
asthma, bronchospasm and arthritis.

This is not a wonderful health care initiative, this is very sad for our
young children who are already given far too many vaccines.
I, too have nursed a few women, who have had cervical cancer but these
were old women, not young children and they were usually women who had
smoked heavily throughout their lives. Cervical cancers like other cancers
are caused by carcinogens or cancer causing

Ohh no not again.

Not another
Vaccines are an evil plot by pharmaceutical companies.
If you microwave food you make it radioactive.
The earth is flat.

A friend of mine had cervical cancer. Â  She did not die from it, so she
will not appear in the statistics but she had to have a Hysterectomy,
radiation and chemotherapy and months of worry if the Cancer was going
to appear somewhere else.

Gardasil has shown in worldwide trials to prevent papilloma virus
infection and reduce Pap smear abnormalities by 90%. Â Of course there
are no long term morality data on the vaccine - that would take 30 years.

If I had a daughter I would be taking her to the doctor for vaccination
as fast as my fat little legs could carry me.

I wish it had been available when my two girls were young, but both of
them will be getting it anyway as soon as they can.

The campaign against the HPV vaccine spotlights the agenda of the
anti-vaccination liars like almost nothing before. The attacks on it
started years ago when it was first announced that it had been
invented and was about to undergo widespread trials. When Ian Frazer
won his Australian of the Year for developing it, he was immediately
attacked. The liars say that all they are concerned about is safety,
but there is no evidence that this vaccine is dangerous in any way.

I am at this very moment downloading the WHO mortality database so
that I can see what the latest figures are, but in 2001 cancer of the
cervix killed about 250,000 women around the world. For the liars,
however, 800 dead women each day is a small price to pay to keep the
world free of vaccines.

I always knew that they hated children. In 2000, the National Vaccine
Information Center participated in a conference to address ways of
sabotaging research into an AIDS vaccine, so they hate gays. Now it
seems they hate women as well.

Who will be next?

was the same as the percentage of unaffected children in the region who
received MMR vaccine
* there was no difference in the age of diagnosis of autism in
vaccinated and unvaccinated children
* the onset of "regressive" symptoms of autism did not occur within
2, 4, or 6 months of receiving the MMR vaccine.

Or perhaps this one

1: J Autism Dev Disord. 2006 Jul 25; [Epub ahead of print]

Department of Human Welfare, Otsuma Women's University, 2-7-1, Karakida,
Tama-city, Tokyo, 206-8540, Japan.

It has been suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR)
is a cause of regressive autism. As MMR was used in Japan only between
1989 and 1993, this time period affords a natural experiment to examine
this hypothesis. Data on 904 patients with autism spectrum disorders
(ASD) were analyzed. During the period of MMR usage no significant
difference was found in the incidence of regression between
MMR-vaccinated children and non-vaccinated children. Among the
proportion and incidence of regression across the three
MMR-program-related periods (before, during and after MMR usage), no
significant difference was found between those who had received MMR and
those who had not. Moreover, the incidence of regression did not change
significantly across the three periods.

If anybody reading this does not want to vaccinate their children - fine

1/ Don't take them to visit children that are too young to be vaccinated.

2/ If they get a runny nose take them the Emergency Department of the
nearest hospital immediately.

Dear Friends,

Watch for this in ohter states! Â If you would like to help the families of
Texas by expressing your concern to our Texas Governor Rick Perry about the
implications of his actions on the rest of the United States of America, you
can contact him at his governor's Opinion Hotline Citizen's Assistance and
Opinion Hotline: (512) 463-1782, Office of the Governor Fax: (512) 463-1849,
Mailing Address: Office of the Governor, P.O. Box 12428, Austin, Texas
78711-2428, or by online submission at
http://www.governor.state.tx.us/contact/#contactinfo - thank you! Here is
the alert that went out in Texas if you could please forward it ot any
contacts in Texas.

Dear PROVE Members:
Even though the states of Michigan, Maryland, and Indiana have killed,
pulled down, or gutted proposed legislation to mandate the controversial new
vaccine called Gardasil made by Merck for the sexually transmitted virus
HPV, our Texas governor Rick Perry did the unthinkable by bypassing the
entire Texas legislature from the process and issuing an intrusive executive
order forcing all of our 11 and 12 year old little girls to be vaccinated
against this sexually transmitted virus in order to attend the 6th grade!

IMMEDIATE responses to your Texas state senator and representative
expressing your opposition is needed!

There are several brave legislators that are working hard at trying to
reverse this, but in order for other legislators to be receptive and sign
onto and support these efforts, they need to know that the people who voted
to put them into office are outraged by the governor's actions. Â Please make
your voice heard NOW!

The governor is hiding behind the claim that parents can opt out of this
mandate, but he is not telling parents the truth that in many cases, the
exemption isn't worth the piece of paper it is printed on: Â private and
parochial schools don't have to accept the exemption, physicians do not have
to accept the exemption and many throw families out of their practices for
not receiving all state mandated vaccines, and some insurance companies are
discriminating against families whose kids have not received all the
vaccines on the state's required list. Â Additionally, the exemption process
is a bureaucratic nightmare requiring written requests to the State Health
Department in Austin forcing the disclosure of your children's full names,
birthdates, and mailing address. Â Sometimes these forms take weeks to be
mailed out by the health department disrupting school attendance and the
forms must be notarized and repeatedly submitted every 2 years.

If you don't know who represents you, you can link to
http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/
and enter your address. Â Click on the links provided for your Texas State
Senator and Texas State Representative to obtain their phone, fax, and
email. Â Forward this alert to your friends and family and ask them to help
flood the legislature with messages that this is a totally unacceptable
abuse of power and demanding that something be done by the legislature to
reverse this and prevent it from happening again.

Thank you!
Sincerely,
Dawn Richardson
Parents Requesting Open Vaccine Education (PROVE)
www.vaccineinfo.net

Here are a handful of talking points to consider:

1) Governor Perry's Executive Order, that MANDATES the HPV vaccine for 6th
grade girls, circumvents the legislative process by usurping the authority
of our elected representatives to debate and decide bills already filed in
the Texas legislature.

2) This MANDATE usurps the rights of the parents of Texas to make medical
decisions for their minor children by requiring this vaccine. Â It is the
parents who have to live with the consequences if their child is injured by
the HPV vaccine, not the governor or the state of Texas. Texas vaccine
exemptions don't apply in many cases so parents aren't really free to say no
to this shot if it is mandated.

3) This MANDATE forces our little girls to be "experiments" for the new HPV
vaccine that has only been on the market since June of 2006 - less than one
year! Â It is made by Merck - the same drug makers as Vioxx! There are
already 82 reports of serious adverse events filed with the FDA following
the administration of this vaccine.

***

Oppose Governor Perry's Executive Order Mandating HPV Vaccine for 6th Grade
Girls:
What Do We Really Know About the HPV Vaccine?

QUESTIONABLE NECESSITY AND EFFECTIVENESS

The American Cancer Society says that even though infection with the
sexually transmitted virus HPV is an important risk factor for cervical
cancer, most women with HPV infection do not get cervical cancer. Doctors
believe other factors must come into play for this cancer to develop. Some
of these factors are smoking, HIV infection, Chlamydia infection, diet,
long-term use of birth control pills, multiple pregnancies, low income,
mothers who took hormonal drug DES, and family history. [1] Â  These are not
typical risk factors affecting junior high girls.

According to the National Institutes of Health National Cancer institute, in
more than 90% of the cases, HPV infections are harmless and go away without
treatment. [2]

Also, according to the CDC, most cervical cancer can be prevented and
cervical cancer is very rare in women who get regular PAP tests.[3]
Cervical Cancer is not a major killer in the state of Texas thanks to PAP
screenings: in 2000, there were 371 deaths from cervical cancer, in 2001
there were 352 and in 2002 there were 329. [4]

The CDC says there are more than 100 strains or types of HPV and over 30
strains are sexually transmitted. [5] Yet the vaccine under consideration
for mandate covers only 4 strains. [6] Â  About 30% of cervical cancers can't
be prevented by the vaccine, so women will still need regular cervical
cancer screenings. [7].

The only current vaccine manufacturer for the HPV vaccine, Merck, admits on
their package insert that the duration of immunity from the vaccine is
unknown. [8] Â In clinical trials, the vaccine's effectiveness was only
followed for 4 years.[9] Â Yet we do know from the CDC that the incubation
period for the HPV virus is about 20 years [10] and the median age of women
diagnosed with cervical cancer is 48 [11]. Â Therefore, no claims to proof of
cervical cancer prevention by vaccinating preteen girls should be made.

QUESTIONABLE SAFETY

The HPV vaccine Gardasil was approved by the FDA on June 8, 2006 after 6
months of review.[12] Â It has been on the market for less than 1 year.

The chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious
diseases was quoted in the Washington Post in response to a proposed mandate
in Washington D.C. saying that he thought it was premature to recommend
making the vaccine mandatory. "I think it's too early," said Joseph A.
Bocchini,."This is a new vaccine. It would be wise to wait until we have
additional information about the safety of the vaccine." [13]

Dr. Martin Meyers, director of the National Network for Immunization
Information, was quoted in the Baltimore Sun in response to a proposed bill
in Maryland to mandate HPV vaccines for 6th grade girls, "A lot of us are
worried it's a little early to be pushing a mandated HPV vaccine." Â He also
said "It's not the vaccine community pushing for this." The article
spotlighted HPV vaccine manufacturer Merck's aggressive role in pushing for
a mandate where across the U.S., HPV vaccine mandates could mean $4 billion
dollars in sales for Merck [14] who is currently plagued by lawsuits for
withholding critical safety information to doctors and patients about their
popular painkiller drug Vioxx.[15]

The FDA's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System has already received 82
reports of serious adverse events following HPV vaccination with Gardasil
since its approval last June. [16]

More questions remain. Â Disclaimers printed on the manufacturer's package
inset state that the vaccine has not been tested for it's own ability to
cause cancer [17] and the effect on a woman's reproductive capacity is
unknown. [18] Additionally, the vaccine is genetically engineered yet the
manufacturer admits it has not tested the vaccine for genotoxicity[17]
(testing to see if the vaccine is toxic to our own human DNA). Â Each dose of
the vaccine contains 225 mcg of aluminum [6] which means girls receiving all
3 HPV doses will be directly injected with 675 mcg of aluminum.

QUESTIONABLE COST

The retail cost of the vaccine is $120 per dose, or $360 for the full series
of 3 shots. [7] Â According to one of the authors of the bills filed, Sen.
Leticia Van de Putte, there are 162,000 6th grade girls[19] which translates
to forcing Texas families paying over $58 million dollars not including the
doctor visits for a vaccine not proven to prevent cervical cancer. Â This is
a high price to force families to pay especially for families skeptical of
the necessity, efficacy, or safety of the vaccine. Â Merck is absolved from
liability for the injuries and deaths caused by the HPV vaccine through the
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 [20] leaving families to deal
with the emotional and monetary costs of the harm caused by the vaccine to
their daughters on their own.

The vaccine is available to anyone who wants it, so it does not need to be
mandated. Â Federal health programs such as Vaccines for Children cover the
HPV vaccine to children and teens under 19 years of age, who are either
uninsured, Medicaid-eligible, American Indian, or Alaska Native. The VFC
Program also allows children and teens to get VFC vaccines through Federally
Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Centers, if their private health
insurance does not cover the vaccine [7], so insurance mandates which raise
the cost of insurance for everyone who does not want or need the vaccine are
not necessary.

That too. The problem is that you don't know where your current
monogamous partner has been before. Then there's that thing called
"impetuousness" that young folk suffer from.

I practice safe gardening and always wear gloves when working around
dirt. Except for the day last November when I almost cut my finger off
with the secateurs because I had a few minutes to spare and a branch
of the bougainvillea was hanging across the path. Because of my safe
gardening practices I had neglected getting a tetanus booster for some
years. That has been fixed in case I stray again.

Sort of - although it's not a law. Â  The governor of Texas issued an
executive order requiring it for girls entering 6th grade - effective
September 2008. Â More at:

http://tinyurl.com/33xquz

According to this article, Texas allows parents to opt out of
vaccinations for religious or philosophical reasons, so it's not really
mandatory (besides not taking effect for more than a year.)

As far as I know, no state has a law requiring the vaccinations,
although proposals have been made in 10-12 states.

Perhaps she should have her future son-in-law tested for HPV, and then
either not allow her daughter to get married, or insist her daughter be
vaccinated.

Well, at the very least if she insists her daughter does not need to be
vaccinated, she should make sure to put condoms into her school backpack so
that she will be prepared.

Though I suspect her definition of "safe sex practices" is to just say no.

Third source of the same news story by the same writer distributed

&gt;The campaign against the HPV vaccine spotlights the agenda of the
&gt;anti-vaccination liars like almost nothing before. The attacks on it
&gt;started years ago when it was first announced that it had been
&gt;invented and was about to undergo widespread trials. When Ian Frazer
&gt;won his Australian of the Year for developing it, he was immediately
&gt;attacked. The liars say that all they are concerned about is safety,
&gt;but there is no evidence that this vaccine is dangerous in any way.

&gt;I am at this very moment downloading the WHO mortality database so
&gt;that I can see what the latest figures are, but in 2001 cancer of the
&gt;cervix killed about 250,000 women around the world. For the liars,
&gt;however, 800 dead women each day is a small price to pay to keep the
&gt;world free of vaccines.

&gt;I always knew that they hated children. In 2000, the National Vaccine
&gt;Information Center participated in a conference to address ways of
&gt;sabotaging research into an AIDS vaccine, so they hate gays. Now it
&gt;seems they hate women as well.
">

Oh, the anti-HIV agenda means they hate women also. Â And probably
black and Asian people in general, if you consider where HIV is most
prevalent and spreading most rapidly.

Aspirin would not pass FDA approval if it was released now. Â So if you
are prepared to give your child Aspirin you should be prepared to give
this vaccine (If safety is your concern).

Unfortunately condoms good for most things but papillomavirus and
Genital Herpes the are able to get around this. Â They still help but the
risk is much higher.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus#Condoms

Condoms

Although condoms are highly effective for preventing the transmission of
other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), recent studies have
concluded that condoms only offer partial protection, at best, against
the transmission of genital HPVs (Holmes 2004; Winer 2006). This may be
due to the fact that HPVs can infect genital skin areas that are not
covered by condoms. On the other hand, some studies have suggested that
regular condom use can effectively limit the ongoing persistence and
spread of HPV to additional genital sites in individuals who are already
infected (Moscicki 2005; Bleecker 2005). Thus, condom use may reduce the
risk that infected individuals will progress to cervical cancer or
develop additional genital warts. A 2006 study of 82 college students
suggests that condoms can be up to 70% effective for preventing genital
HPV infection if used for every sexual encounter (Winer 2006). Both
Planned Parenthood and the Centers for Disease Control recommend condom
use to reduce the risk of HPV-related diseases.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; children with autism born between 1979 and 1998. They found:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that everyone here is missing the point here...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Vaccinations should be a matter of choice for something like this. Now if
&gt;&gt;&gt; HPV were transmitted as easily as having a cold it would be a different
&gt;&gt;&gt; story.
&gt;&gt; I totally agree. Â I do not think Gardasil vaccination should be
&gt;&gt; compulsory.

&gt;&gt; Just because John says some extremists think it should be compulsory does
&gt;&gt; not mean it ever will be.

&gt;&gt; However, IMO, Â If I was a father of daughters I think I would be negligent
&gt;&gt; of my duty of care if I did not vaccinate my daughters.

&gt;&gt; As a father I cannot think of anything worse than watching my child suffer
&gt;&gt; Cancer because I was swayed by flat earth science. Â It does not mean that
&gt;&gt; I believe there is no risk in any medical treatment, but, in this case the
&gt;&gt; benefits , IMO, far out way the risks.

&gt; Just a small twist to this...

&gt; If they had an innoculation that would make it very uncomfortable (but not
&gt; life threatening) to smoke cigarettes for the rest of a persons life, would
&gt; you innoculate your kids?
">

Not a fair comparison. Â Once your child is infected that is it.
Gardisil is protective not a cure.

Not that I will use that to avoid your question. Â Making some thing
uncomfortable that I don't like for my child - I don't have the right to
make that decision - I would not do it.

It is now routine in this country Australia. Â To vaccinate

Scudamore's answer to this varies. Â Some of his sources insist
that it vanished on its own, some insist that it was improved

Adverse Effects

In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions reported with
quadrivalent HPV vaccine administration were injection site reactions
and fever. Using data accumulated in five clinical trials, the most
frequently reported adverse effect was pain (reported in 84% of
patients versus 49-75% of patients given placebo), followed by
swelling and erythema (reported in 25% of HPV vaccine recipients
compared to 1-18% of those given placebo), and pruritus (3% in the
vaccine group versus 1-3% in the placebo group). Fever within 15 days
of vaccination was reported in 10% of the HPV vaccine group and 9% of
the placebo group.[2-5]

Other adverse reactions reported after HPV vaccine administration
included headache (0.03% in vaccine recipients compared to 0.02% in
controls), gastroenteritis (0.032% versus 0.01% in controls),
appendicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease (0.02% versus 0.01% in
controls).[2-5]
