Uno, billy keeps rolling this out as if to create a truth. But by
applying a little critical thinking, it really doesn't fly.

First, he leaves unsaid that the cost of initial plant infrastructure
does in no way reflect the cost from building it to decommission.

Last time I looked it cost $1/watt to build a coal plant but $3-$5/watt
over its lifetime. So in the case of coal, 'backing wind up' runs 25%.
The bonus is conserving a limited resource.

Second, storage. It has been pretty well beat to death that until wind
has a 20% impact storage is not an issue. We have 20gw of pumped storage
in the U.S. today. Why is that? It is because demand is not steady. We
use methane peakers for this reason. It should be interesting to
correlate the times of max wind on a daily basis compared to demand.
Solar at a buck a peak watt too.

Two and a half.
Fossil fuels are not going to get cheaper into the future.

Third, methane peakers. They go in for a capital cost of just 50 cents a
watt. We don't use them instead of coal because of the cost of fuel. So
even in the fossil fuel industry there is something more important than
cost of infrastructure.

I could go on and keep gluing the numbers together but I'll leave that
exercise to billy. If my concern is wrong, I would really like to see
the numbers that back it. All the numbers, not just the ones that suit
an agenda.

Good night and good luck.

Have you no sense of decency, sir?

The remarkable thing about windpower is it's remarkable property of
occasionally providing relief for baseload generation, occasionally even
at night, if your baseload happens to be solar. This is a known money
saver for maintenance and equipment longevity. Where I'm at, wind for
all practical purposes is the baseload.

The grid that has the highest percentage of wind is germany at
4.5%, that is not baseload, it is not even peaking, it is a miniscule
percentage that is fully covered by the balance of the grid, when I am
speaking of baseload, I am speaking of the 50-75% of power that is
running all the time, and wind is really no good for that.  I am not
saying it is not useful, I am saying that it is limited to 20% before
the installed price needs to increase to take into account for the
storage or long distance transmission, as such it is not and will not
in the forseeable future be an acceptable option for primary baseload.

Sorry, denmark at 20%, still not approaching "baseload" and we
will note that 20% is the oft-cited maximum penetration before things
start getting nasty with storage or transmission.
I should also mention that wind wold be a truly excellent source
of electricity for italy, which currently uses primarily oil plants
for baseload.  Italy could suspend new fuel plant construction and
build windfarms amounting to 75% or more of their current total
generation without having any difficulties whatsoever.  The 20% figure
is due to the type and numbers of the plants on the existing grid and
reflects todays numbers, not the numbers at any point in the future.
Italy is instead going back to nuclear, which even I as a strong
proponent of nuclear, consider to be suboptimal in their current
situation.

What I like about wind power that it is already available
personally to me at the same cost as conventional coal/gas power.
Here in Texas you can have following residential power providers:
http://www.powertochoose.org/electricchoice/compareresults.asp?zip=75082

You can see that I can have a wind-only provider (      Spark Energy, L.P.
Spark 100% Renewable Advantage 12) for 135$ / kWh
vs a lot of other providers charging the same or more amount for conventional
fuel plans. In fact majority of other conventional plans are more expensive.

The most commonly used provider, TXU Energy, has all their plans more
expensive than this wind-only plan:

TXU Energy
SummerSavings 24 SM
$144    24
Terms of Service ; Facts Label  $0.144/kWh
TXU Energy
TXU Energy PowerStartSM
$150    1

TXU Energy
TXU Energy SecureSaver 36SM
$143    36

Ain't that amazing?

To be fair, Denmark is linked to the Scandinavian grid which has
extensive Hydro electric power. Hydro power is probably the perfect
accompaniment to wind.

With grid linkages, Europe could achieve 20% wind power with any
significant extra capacity costs. And Europe is a long way off 20%.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Last time I looked it cost $1/watt to build a coal plant but $3-$5/watt

&gt; &gt; &gt; all practical purposes is the baseload.

&gt; &gt; in the forseeable future be an acceptable option for primary baseload.

&gt;      Sorry, denmark at 20%, still not approaching &quot;baseload&quot; and we

Sweden is about 47% hydro, 45% nuclear the test fossil or imports.
So...the Danish wind farms are backup up by Swedish nuclear in large
part. Makes sense.

BTW...coal plants can be ramped up faster than Gas Turbines, ectually,
depending on the size of the GT. Usually a ramp up on any fossil
plants is 4 to 10 megawatts a minute. Firing (adding fuel) is a
function usually of a decrease in steam pack at the turbine throttle
valves.

A 175 MW simple-cycle GT like a GE Frame 7AE gets to 100 MWs in 18
minutes. Not bad.

Here is the rub. The *smaller* the wind farm, the easier it is for on
demand power to make up the fall-off when the wind dies down. The
higher the % of wind unreliable wind power, the harder the fossil (and
hydro/nuclear) plants have to work and, worse, swing up and down on
load to. Its a case of the tail wagging to the dog.

What they do at big wind farms is to collect the DC voltage and let it
out as AC into the grid *lower* than what they make it for...allowing
a 5% or more 'wiggle room' for the system operator to take into
accounts low and high outputs.

I'm not even sure how a true 50% of the grid wind farm would actually
be controlled, it would be very difficult given that the MWs are never
stable, and system operators hate instability, for obvious reasons. I
suppose we'll see it at some point.

I have heard that wind and solar will not be very practical until a
"Smart Grid" is in place
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-09/teia-seg092203.php
and building wind farms "in the US" before upgrading the grid is putting
the cart before the horse...

&gt; &gt; load to. Its a case of the tail wagging to the dog.

&gt; &gt; What they do at big wind farms is to collect the DC voltage and let it
&gt; &gt; out as AC into the grid *lower* than what they make it for...allowing
&gt; &gt; a 5% or more 'wiggle room' for the system operator to take into
&gt; &gt; accounts low and high outputs.

&gt; &gt; I'm not even sure how a true 50% of the grid wind farm would actually
&gt; &gt; be controlled, it would be very difficult given that the MWs are never
&gt; &gt; stable, and system operators hate instability, for obvious reasons. I
&gt; &gt; suppose we'll see it at some point.

&gt; I have heard that wind and solar will not be very practical until a
&gt; &quot;Smart Grid&quot; is in place http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-09/teia-seg092203.php
&gt; and building wind farms &quot;in the US&quot; before upgrading the grid is putting
&gt; the cart before the horse...
&gt; Any Comments?

well, with the existing grid, a good deal of wind and solar can
be pretty easily installed without getting in trouble.  PV is a good
match for peak demand in areas where it's worth considering installing
pv to begin with (the desert) so simply put, it drops the load on the
peaking plants without producing any problems with storage or
transportation, it all gets used close to where it's produced.
windfarms are a bit different, they are a poorer match for peak demand
and fluctuate faster and less predictably, none of this is an issue
for a few hundred megawatts, the existing grid has to have the
capability to respond to these fluctuations in order to keep up with
demand changes.   Basically, the grid can more or less ignore the wind
and it all works out.  When you get above a certain threshold, the
grid needs an upgrade in order to be able to cope with these
fluctuations without overburdening the other components of the
system.  That doesn't matter until rather a lot more wind has been
installed than currently exists in the us, so as long as the windfarms
are spread out and not relied upon, they can reduce the fossil fuel
consumption without causing problems.

Maximum peak demand for California today is predicted to occur at
about 7pm. This follows a smaller peak that was at about 2pm.

Sunset is 5:50pm.

I write this at 4:55pm.

Exactly...we run the peak curve constantly. Also, there are sepeate
peaks for different areas...San Francisco being different than, say,
Modesto. But solar does not match peak. At any rate few commericial or
industrial sites are buying into solar (none, actually) simply because
it is too expensive. Residence (17%) in California load their is a
very small buy in right now because 50% of the price is subsidized by
you an me (which it makes it easier for richer residents to take
advantage of GIPV right now) right now. I think, however, it's silly
NOT to write into building codes the madatory use of PV in new builds
and discounts on financing for those that want to install it. It can't
hurt even if the upfront costs are a little high (OK, very high).
Renters, of course, get nothing out of PV, only the landlord does, but
there is some talk of legislating rent-savings for landlords that put
on PV. I'll believe that when it happens.

Wind actually does better in California state wide as it's generally
after 4pm that the winds come up.

In my not-so-humble opinion, you will see California building more and
more GTs and no nukes. But the big thing will be that you will see
more and more coal, and some nuclear, imported into the State for a
continuel net outflow of dollars out of the state for the next few
decades. Wind will never make it here and the gigawatts needed are not
going to come here from wind or solar.

But this assumes that an aggregate of wind turbines on the grid will be
doing this 'up-down' thing. In class three or better the wind is
predictable and comes and goes in very long terms, many hours.

A somewhat higher rate of change than,
http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wres/variab.htm

Sorry if I don't do the math. But producers seem to handle change just fine.

In the case of solar, same applies. Solar may not be able to directly
offset sundown peaks but nether does it have to. Until/if there is a lot
more solar would contingency have consideration. As that would be
decades off, we would likely see the pumped storage to go along.

Why does it always have to gravitate back to PV? Solar thermal is much
cheaper and getting cheaper. Talk, (I said talk billy.) is that we could
see a buck a peak watt in a decade with solar thermal. That is quite
equitable, especially considering what part of the demand curve it works on.

A look at the forcast winds for San Franciso, Los Angeles, and San Diego
shows that the winds start to die just after sunset.

A look at the three days history for Upland, CA says this is generally

Agree, california with the moderate climate isn't a particularly
good choice for pv.  It makes FAR more sense in arizona and texas, as
I said, the desert.  In those locations, the peak is mostly made up of
AC during the heat of the day.  it's also worth noting that pv only
makes sense if you're comparing apples to grapes a little, meaning if
you're using subsidized pv to avoid purchasing retail peak power.
under any other conditions it's.... just dumb.
On the graph in your cite, there's a far bigger difference
between the long high area that occurs during most of the day and the
late night than there is between the normal daily demand and the
absolute peak.  What you DID demonstrate to me, and I thank you for
it, is that no amount of PV installation will ever mean that you can
take 1 conventional plant permanently offline.  however, it will allow
you to idle some for a greater part of the day.

Indeed, which was my point. The net CO2 increase will come from the
coal plants in Nevada and AZ, some from Wyoming...and GTs that are do
to come on line.

Right now, wind  and solar (well, PV is silly at this point, it
contributes squat to the grid anywhere) can b e used as an expensive
way to allay fueling coal and gas. In this sense they compliment each
other. The real issue, as Dr. Sutherland points out and other at
energypulse.com is that countries like Denmark, when the approach 20%
windpower: the grid almost dies because you get these huge variable
genaration sources that grid cannot compensate for. Most wind actually
is used to supplement Scandanavian hydry which tends to run dry around
September. So most of that wind isn't even used in Denmark.

No, the electrical grid conferences I've attended (big ISO attendees
btw) say that for evey ruquest now for wind, a request for more fossil
follows it *immediatly*. Most ISO in the US (as they have done in
northern Europe) is for the operators of windfarms to show where the
base-load/supplemental power will come for ever GWhr installed for
wind. Which is fair...no one, least of all the wind farm operators,
opposes this. It's why big players like GE LOVE wind...it'd doubles
their money since for every 50 MWs of Wind turbines, they know they
are in the game for a 50 MW GT peaker or larger base-load plant. I
talked to some of the GE Energy guys...they get BIG bonuses...
