Some interesting stuff here from GM and Calcar's Felix Kramer; worth a
read. Also, some of the blog responses raise some good questions:

Things are looking up. GM certainly did an about face after reading
our scathing sarcasm about their reverse inadequacies! Now that we've
got their ear let's tell them what kind of ebikes we want AND the
joystick steering.

All yuks aside -- the Volt does look to be a sincere, very high tech
effort. It must also give a kick in the pants to other manufacturers
to compete. It is great to know that; they acknowledge that the movie
'Who Killed the Electric Car' impacted them, helped kick them back in
the saddle, and now they are trying to heal relations with greenies
and EVies. They could have remained obstinately dying but are
aparently aiming at rebirth!! I've got my fingers crossed fer em!

I like that the volt will have only 300 cells rather than the
thousands of D cells, or whatever the Tesla is slated to have. Imagine
trying to find bad cells in a pack of thousands. The bigger cells will
be good for us ebikers too. I like that Doug's Point Ones have only 10
cells.

Exciting times -- especially if you can ride an electric TF now and
watch the world catch up!!

Joystick steering -- now all I need is joystick steering -- maybe I'll
make a movie to get their attention -- 'Who Killed the Wheel!!'  By
Jove I've got it !!!!

I like this quote:

GM head Bob Lutz quipped to the media that &quot;we probably would've gotten
better drag coefficient if we put it in the wind tunnel backwards.&quot;

I sure hope they don't destroy the looks in an effort to make it more wind
tunnel friendly, because if my gearhead hotrod stepsons are an indicator of
young peoples reaction to the Volt, the looks are what will sell it to the
younger generation.
The Volt sure didn't look any more un streamlined than say a Chrysler 300,
or a Malibu which is rumored to be the new platform for the Volt, but what
do I know.

Tracy,

GM insists the Malibu is strictly a temporary mule for the Volt while
they beta test the drivetrain and such, and I think they're aware the
Volt will have to be unique. It will be interesting to see what the
final design looks like--maybe an oversized big daddy EV1 &lt;g&gt;?

Larry,

Yep, I also read that, time will tell.
Personally, I don't see why something like wind drag on a car that they are
not touting as a bullet even matters.
There's probably some other reason that has to do with cost in the final
build that would make more sense.
They better be careful though, the thing was a hit as much for it's looks as
anything else it seems.
How about this Volt Forum?
Awful lot of people want to plunk down the money for one.
Tell me these forums don't do some good with the powers that be.
It's the modern way for them to judge public opinion it seems.
Thanks for finding that blog.

Tracy

Tracy,

I agree. On line forums have become a very powerful medium/force that
mfgrs and businesses need to respect and listen to, and this fellow
who started the Volt forum has done such a good job with it that he
has GM's ear in a very big way. To their credit, GM appears to have
given him very generous access to many of the engineers and marketing
and design people behind the Volt project. Talk about the power of the
press!

Regards,

Larry

P.S. I'm guessing the aero issue with the Volt is likely very
significant in GM hitting its 40-mile all-e target range. You can only
ask these batteries to do so much, and if an aero design smooths the
way, it seems to me a pretty key factor in getting this car to
succeed.
