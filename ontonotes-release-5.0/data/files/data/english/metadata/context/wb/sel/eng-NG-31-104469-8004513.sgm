Hi Gyrosians,

Hello from sunny and warn Lavanto, Italy.  Lee and  I just finshed hiking through the Dolimites and are now spending a few days on the west coast of  Italy.  See everyone next weekend.

Cheers,

Bert

&gt; Gyrosians,

&gt; I wanted to send out a kudos to Gary for selecting a great route today. I also want to remind him that under the rules of ride leader he must post a ride review.

&gt; I have to ask Brian a question: Did you ride the entire distance in your 50x12? Jeez Louise. Impressive.

&gt; See everyone tomorrow morning. I am looking for a nice controlled recovery ride. I can't stand it when riders break up the paceline with testosterone-ignited, zoned out surges.

Bert,

Is it true Italian men like shaved legs?  Or was that Greek men...

:-)

Enjoy the beautiful Italian Mediterranean, the food and the wine.
Please say hello to Lee, have a wonderful time and a safe trip home.

See you soon.

Gary

Grace and I are green with envy! Hiking in the Dolomites!! I would imagine that you could come up with quite the route for our Saturday ride in the Italian Alps.

I am of Sicilian descent, so if you pass through Sicily look for someone that looks like me. It would mean absolutely nothing at all, but it is something to do! Look for shaved legs and a Roman nose.?If you see some gorgeous Italian women there is a good chance that they are direct descendants of Grace!

Send our best to Lee, and truly enjoy your time in that great country. Please have a safe trip back home.

Rick and Grace
