Neither.
It is a confabulated story by Rinpoche.
What his intent is, I have no idea.
Context is important.

As far as me for context, I do not share
his paradigm enough.

Okay, let me go out on a limb here!!!! I'm saying ----- SPIRITUAL ----

Was I right??? Where's the answer key????

Feelin' all froggy, just got back from Florida...

Important point #1 : Florida sun will fry you much quicker than
northern sun...

Important point #2 : Florida beaches (at least, Jacksonville) ALLOW

Then let me elaborate.

His intent is to help people to recognise different aspects of themselves.
The spiritual from the illusionary.

Context?  I-dentification.

&quot;Physicality&quot; is a convenient lable. You ask me if I deny such existance.
Why?

My point being , if you place the word physical for &quot;spiritual&quot; in your
comment, the question is still as valid, even though on the surface, it may
appear different.

Applies equally to some master motor mechanic who can hear whether your

Where's his proof?

Even the word &quot;religion&quot; is becoming a hook these days, let alone what it
represents, being &quot;group think&quot;.

Take a good look at yourself, then ask &quot;whos doing the looking, and how can
I prove it is happening&quot;.

It's in the sounds, the rhythm, the frequency spread, etc.  I think
one cannot &quot;prove&quot; the existence of a tree; but, one can feel it, look
at it and get your friends to do the same and reach a consensus on the
observations. Some can tell what kind of tree it is by their history

Hope that doesnt change...:-)

I'm sure she needs no proof.

It is easy to come to a concensus, the ultimate version being the language
we use.

When one sees a tree as an integrated part of a wholistic planetary system,
proof becomes less achievable...less when the insight first appears.

Good point!  Of course, you can't see a tree as part of a holistic
system, you can see a tree, and you can posit a holistic planetary
system with the tree in its proper place but it seems to me you can
only *see* the tree as a tree.  The holistic system has to be
imagined.

Vision is so basic to what we are that &quot;see&quot; is used to describe all
kinds of mental and sensory activity, there's an ad on TV where a
blind man goes into a restroom with fancy plumbing fixtures which he
feels with his fingers.  When he comes out he says to his sighted
companion, &quot;You should see the bathroom !&quot;

Still, I think the difference between what one does when one *sees* a
tree and what one does when one *sees* a holistic system is an
important one  and bears on the issue of knowledge and proof.

&gt; &quot;Physicality&quot; is a convenient lable. You ask me if I deny such existance.
&gt; Why?

No, I think &quot;physical&quot; is far more certain than &quot;spiritual&quot;. We can

Is that the senses using the senses, or the toe nails (VERY physical ;-)...

Read &quot;spiritual self&quot; for &quot;authentic self&quot;, and you will at least see why i

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BOfL

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Religious,in that it makes claims about what I am made up of without
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; supporting evidence.  My first reaction is to wonder whether the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; facts
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the quote alleges are true, the second is to wonder how he knows.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; These tend to be the same kind of things I wonder when someone
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; religious tells me the details of his faith.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Applies equally to some master motor mechanic who can hear whether
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; engine is tuned in.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Where's his proof?

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's in the sounds, the rhythm, the frequency spread, etc.  I think
&gt;&gt; &gt; one cannot &quot;prove&quot; the existence of a tree; but, one can feel it, look
&gt;&gt; &gt; at it and get your friends to do the same and reach a consensus on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; observations. Some can tell what kind of tree it is by their history
&gt;&gt; &gt; of many such observations and consultations. The &quot;proof&quot; is a pattern
&gt;&gt; &gt; of confirmed observation over a period of time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even the word &quot;religion&quot; is becoming a hook these days, let alone what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; represents, being &quot;group think&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Take a good look at yourself, then ask &quot;whos doing the looking, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I prove it is happening&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I can see a good bit of myself, not my face unless I use a
&gt;&gt; &gt; mirror, two mirrors to see my back.  It's me doing the looking, I
&gt;&gt; &gt; consult with my wife and as in the paragraph above there is a pattern
&gt;&gt; &gt; of confirmed observations.

&gt;&gt; &gt; She does not see the extra person inside me, just the me she's known
&gt;&gt; &gt; all along.  Me too.

&gt;&gt; Hope that doesnt change...:-)

&gt;&gt; I'm sure she needs no proof.

&gt;&gt; It is easy to come to a concensus, the ultimate version being the
&gt;&gt; language

&gt;&gt; When one sees a tree as an integrated part of a wholistic planetary

Also good point.

Ther is strong historical persuasion from some well known mystics that tell
us we only see what we imagine. Try arguing the &quot;wholistic&quot; point regarding
the tree with a greeny.

While you are doing that, I'll attempt to talk spirituality to the Mormons
knocking on my door hehehehe

Exactly. Progressively, we have anecdotal (religion)..epistomological
(scientific) ontological (philosophical, and &quot;conscious savants&quot;.

Living with integration makes for a happy life. (know thyself's ).
