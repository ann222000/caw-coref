Hi Ladies!! I am in the process of looking into maybe working at another salon on my days off which are Sun, Mon, Tues, &amp; Wed. due to the salon i just relocated too is very slow an these days and it was a waste of time to just sit there. So I just called this one salon and the owner answered and worked hard at trying to discourage me from applying or interviewing due to my not living within walking distance from the salon. It's on South Beach(25 miles south of my house). she talked about how her other employees live in SB and either walk or ride scooters to work, but she didn't ask me how far i lived away. SOOOO! I knew where the salon was located when I called. Sorry ladies I'm gonna call it like I see it; i think it surprises owners to know that there are professional africian american nail techs in the world! this chic never once asked me about my experience, know how, or even my name. she heard a black voice and replied : oh! I don't you will want to commute and the
parking is terrible. AWWH!!! Hello!! I am a true native floridian! I was born and raised in Miami Fl!!! This is my life; All of the tourist in the way of the people that live here!!! I knew what I was getting in to when I made the decision to call. she was a bias B$%^&amp;! sorry!! I had to vent but I'm okay now.People are something else it's 2007 get over it! I just had a country club to call me with an interview offer, they are offering  commission 70% but I supply, medical &amp; 401k. What do you think?

for your sanity I would go where you feel comfortable!!? Try the country club and see what it has to offer...the prices are probably higher therefore your % will be better...

Candace,
Well, all I can say is they will be the ones who will miss out.
You know what you should do? Send a resume with your work history and photos of your work.
I cannot imagine in this day and age that people still have issues with &quot;color.&quot; Damn... well, today a client told me a story about a client of hers that was kind of disheartening about him not hiring black people. Well, I say, I will not give HIM my business and I damn sure will be sure to pass that info along so NO ONE *I* know will ever use his business. What an @$$.
Oh, and when they call you because they love your work, tell them you found a better job... at a COUNTRY CLUB!!! ;-)
buenos dias,
Lynnette

Candace,

It sounds like you need to go to the country club!!!!  That's good
commission!  Besides, if that owner in South Beach is like that about you,  I wonder
what she'd do if somebody with a heavy hispanic accent had called or  any other
for that matter!!  Go to the country club, make a ton, have a  blast and snub
YOUR nose at her!!

I&quot;m so sorry you had that experience.  I work with an African American woman
and I love her like a sister.  She is the most talented nail tech I've ever
seen and she has helped my technique more than anyone else.  It is 2007, but
unfortuneately there are still ignorant folks running around.  Try not to take it
personally.  I've worked for predjudiced people before.  I'm very overweight
and there's fat bias, too.  You wouldn't want to work there anyway.  Sounds
like the other offer is better, anyway.

Take a deep breath and consider the source.

Kathryn

Dear Candace,

I work with all black nail techs  in Chicago.  I am white.   We have both white and black professional clients.  We all have a great bond and respect each other and share lunch.
Racism doesn't exist everywhere and sometimes only in our minds. Look from within yourself
sometimes we have preset attitudes  that set the course.  Have you read the book The Sercret?

Uhmm Karen, what are you talking about!!!!! Once again it's being swept under the rug. I'm not crazy she was rude, she  never asked my name or about my experience. and to further your knowledge about me because it's clear you are taking a stab in the dark; I'm the only paint job(black person) in the salon that I work in with an entirely white clientele and you know what my clients and co-workers love and respect me and I them. So the only thing that's existing in my mind is how people think that it's ok to devalue a person because of the color of their skin!!!! And for your info racism is everywhere but now  it's just swept under the rug and made to fell like it's a figment of your imagination ie.. your comment below! I live in the most diverse state in the country and guess what there is racism everywhere even if it's just among each other. So i'm kindly suggesting that you back-off until you have walked in my shoes! Thank for commenting don't take it personal,Please!

The Secret is by Rhonda Byrne.  This book was featured on Oprah's list.  It talks about the power of your mind and how the way you think good and bad  reflects the life that you are living.   It takes a look at what we are saying to ourselves, it is positive or negative? Negative energy attracts negative energy.   Positive energy or way of thinking attracts positive situations .  There is a video also.
Thank for asking.

Karen

Hello Ladies,
Can anyone recommend a good Odorless acrylic product? Perhaps with a try me kit?
The beauty supplies around here don't stock any odorless products. I subscribe to Nails and Nailpro. There are several advertised, if I am going to have to mail order one or two I would like to cut my shipping expenses and know which are the best ones.
Thank you in advance

Go to kupainc.com and get the number. Call them and request a free odorless kit sample. Great customer service and they'll get it sent out to you all for free! :) And they're right down in CA so it should get to you pretty quickly. I think they're in Brea?

I would just like to add another thing here if I may. My husband and I have
done several self improvement courses - two of which were Bob Proctors
courses. He came to Sydney Australia twice and we had the privilege of
attending both courses. He was absolutely fantastic and better in person
than on the screen.

Sorry I digress. One of the things that I have picked up along the way and
that is not clearly mentioned in The Secret is the self-talk, self-doubt -
whatever name you wish to call it. It is that inner voice that tells you,
you can't do that, what are you thinking? You are not bright enough/smart
enough to do that etc etc. It is when this voice rears its ugly head, and it
will with great regularity, that you need to then change it to a positive
thought and just believe and know that what you want up can have and it is
coming to you the more you believe and dream it. An analogy that I once
heard was when you go to a restaurant and order your meal, you KNOW and
TRUST that your meal will arrive on your table. You don't keep asking the
waiter to check on it or to make sure that the chef did actually get your
order.

So it is with manifesting. You need to trust God/Spirit/Universe [whatever
name you wish to use, as they are all One] that your wish is coming and
every time you have it in your thoughts, it is coming faster to you. I
manifested my job, then my house - and it has everything in it that I had in
my affirmation, and my new car - which was 6 months old, but new to me. I am
now applying this to my nail business which I have let slide for some time.
I have spoken with a couple of people at work who admire my nails and would
love to have their nails done. So now I see them happy with my work and I
thank the Universe for bringing them into my path as they will help me to
expand my small business from home.

Sorry to go so much, but I do feel passionate about this and I am applying
this passion to my nails as well. I have proof that it works, so I don't
doubt that there is more coming for me.

Thank you all for your patience in reading this.

The Secret is by Rhonda Byrne.  This book was featured on Oprah's list.  It
talks about the power of your mind and how the way you think good and bad
reflects the life that you are living.   It takes a look at what we are
saying to ourselves, it is positive or negative? Negative energy attracts
negative energy.   Positive energy or way of thinking attracts positive
situations .  There is a video also.

Thank for asking.

I tried Vicki Peter's Odorless but didn't like it. I just don't like to
deal with that sticky layer and too slow curing time. I'm sticking with
regular acrylic. The odor isn't bad at all with my fume extractor.

Amen, Candace! When I owned my salon I could not believe the blatant racist comments some clients and potential clients made to me. I'm white so I guess they thought I'd agree with them or at least understand. I had a client tear up her check in my face and cancel her standing appointment because she saw both pedicure units in use with, gasp, BLACK PEOPLE!!!! I hope she got a fungal infection from her &quot;whites only&quot; pedicure tub she went to at the next salon who didn't clean their tubs out with bleach! Maybe she got a &quot;whites only&quot;  bacterial infection. I had another man arrive for his refereed manicure appointment and when I gestured in the direction of 2 of my techs who were chatting, one black and one white, and said &quot;M&quot; is ready for you now, he asked with horror if his appointment was with the black one?

I do agree that you see what you look for, but I also know blatant racism when I'm slapped in the face with it.

I also have a story about people seeing racism where it does not exist. I was at a Chinese buffet restaurant where the booth was one continuous bench seat all the way across one wall and chairs on the other side. I had set my purse in the middle of the bench where people slide into the table next to us. So, when a black couple was seated at the table next to us, I moved my purse out of her way, then noticed that it was now in my way if I wanted to get seconds from the buffet so I moved it to the other side. The woman began rebuffing me on my racist attitude. I let her speak, then informed her of what I'd really done, moved my crap out of her way and mine, excuse me for trying to be polite.

Another Chinese buffet. While walking back to my table I observed several tables. I noticed a little blond curly headed girl who was very cute and the table behind mine where 2 black couples were seated. I thought, it sure must be nice to have another couple to go out with, my husband and I don't really have another couple that we're friends with. My last client of the day had royally pis#*% me off and apparently I was walking around with a scowl on my face because I hear one of the men at the table behind me complaining about my racist attitude loudly. I began to complain to my husband equally as loud that people who thought the world revolved around them annoy me to no end. I then recounted why I was so POed at my client and pointed out that the pretty blond curly headed girl got the same scowl every table got. The scowl had nothing to do with anyone except that bi#*% Judy!

My point? Blatant racism is intolerable, so is unfair judgment of others.

Uhmm Karen, what are you talking about!!!!! Once again it's being swept under the rug. I'm not crazy she was rude, she  never asked my name or about my experience. and to further your knowledge about me because it's clear you are taking a stab in the dark; I'm the only paint job(black person) in the salon that I work in with an entirely white clientele and you know what my clients and co-workers love and respect me and I them. So the only thing that's existing in my mind is how people think that it's ok to devalue a person because of the color of their skin!!!! And for your info racism is everywhere but now  it's just swept under the rug and made to fell like it's a figment of your imagination ie.. your comment below! I live in the most diverse state in the country and guess what there is racism everywhere even if it's just among each other.

I work with all black nail techs  in Chicago.  I am white.   We have both white and black professional clients.  We all have a great bond and respect each other and share lunch.
Racism doesn't exist everywhere and sometimes only in our minds. Look from within yourself
sometimes we have preset attitudes  that set the course.  Have you read the book The Sercret?

You know what you should do? Send a resume with your work history and photos of your work.
I cannot imagine in this day and age that people still have issues with &quot;color.&quot; Damn... well, today a client told me a story about a client of hers that was kind of disheartening about him not hiring black people. Well, I say, I will not give HIM my business and I damn sure will be sure to pass that info along so NO ONE *I* know will ever use his business. What an @$$.

Hi Ladies!! I am in the process of looking into maybe working at another salon on my days off which are Sun, Mon, Tues, &amp; Wed. due to the salon i just relocated too is very slow an these days and it was a waste of time to just sit there. So I just called this one salon and the owner answered and worked hard at trying to discourage me from applying or interviewing due to my not living within walking distance from the salon. It's on South Beach(25 miles south of my house). she talked about how her other employees live in SB and either walk or ride scooters to work, but she didn't ask me how far i lived away. SOOOO! I knew where the salon was located when I called. Sorry ladies I'm gonna call it like I see it; i think it surprises owners to know that there are professional africian american nail techs in the world! this chic never once asked me about my experience, know how, or even my name. she heard a black voice and replied : oh! I don't you will want to
commute and the parking is terrible. AWWH!!! Hello!! I am a true native floridian! I was born and raised in Miami Fl!!! This is my life; All of the tourist in the way of the people that live here!!! I knew what I was getting in to when I made the decision to call. she was a bias B$%^&amp;! sorry!! I had to vent but I'm okay now.People are something else it's 2007 get over it! I just had a country club to call me with an interview offer, they are offering  commission 70% but I supply, medical &amp; 401k. What do you think?
