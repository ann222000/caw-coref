Democrats praise military progress

WASHINGTON - One senator said U.S. troops are routing out al-Qaida in
parts of Iraq. Another insisted President Bush's plan to increase
troops has caused tactical momentum.

One even went so far on Wednesday as to say the argument could be made
that U.S. troops are winning.

These are not Bush-backing GOP die-hards, but Democratic Sens. Dick
Durbin, Bob Casey and Jack Reed. Even Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services committee, said progress was being made by
soldiers.

The suggestions by them and other Democrats in recent days that at
least a portion of Bush's strategy in Iraq is working is somewhat
surprising, considering the bitter exchanges on Capitol Hill between
the Democratic majority and Republicans and Bush. Democrats have long
said Bush's policies have been nothing more than a complete failure.

The Democrats' choice to acknowledge the military's progress in Iraq
signals support for the troops, a message that voters want to hear.
But they still heap criticism on Bush and his Iraq strategy, which
promises to be a prominent issue in next year's presidential election.

All of Washington is waiting for the September assessment from Gen.
David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan
Crocker about the Bush administration strategy. Bush has called the
plan a &quot;surge&quot; because it poured thousands more troops into the
country.

A key component of the January plan was that there be political
progress in Iraq. Last week, the chief lawmaking body in Iraq went
into recess until September without accomplishing much of what U.S.
leaders had hoped they would.

Levin, while saying military progress was being made, said the troop
build-up could not be considered a success because its purpose was to
make way for political reconciliation, and that hasn't happened.

&quot;The only hope is if they take the responsibility onto themselves and
we end the open-ended military commitment,&quot; Levin, of Michigan, said
Sunday on CNN's &quot;Late Edition.&quot;

Reed, a Rhode Island senator who visited Iraq last month, said there's
been tactical momentum, but it &quot;has yet to translate itself into real
political momentum, which is the key, I think, to progress.&quot;

Durbin, an Illinois senator who is traveling this week with
Pennsylvania Sen. Casey, told CNN on Wednesday that &quot;naturally&quot; troops
are routing out al-Qaida in parts of Iraq, but then explained there's
no evidence of the government in the areas.

In a conference call with reporters, Casey said one could make a good
argument that U.S. troops have won the war, then accused Iraqi
politicians and the Bush administration of not matching the intensity
of the troops.

&quot;The troops have met every assignment, they've beaten the odds time
and again, they've done everything we've asked them to,&quot; Casey said.

California Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney had a different take. After
visiting Iraq last month and visiting with Petraeus, McNerney said
signs of progress led him to decide he'll be a little more flexible
about when troops should be brought home.

&quot;I'm more willing to work with finding a way forward to accommodate
what the generals are saying,&quot; McNerney said.

US Marine killed in Iraq

Thu Aug 9, 7:10 AM ET

BAGHDAD (AFP) - An American Marine has been killed in fighting in Iraq's
western province of Al-Anbar, the military said on Thursday.

The Marine died on Tuesday during combat operations in the province, which
remains a flashpoint for Al-Qaeda-linked militants despite an increasing
number of tribal leaders allying themselves to the Americans.

The military earlier announced that an American Marine deployed in Al-Anbar
died in a non-combat related incident.

Two British soldiers killed, two injured in Iraq: defence ministry

Thu Aug 9, 8:51 AM ET

LONDON (AFP) - Two soldiers have been killed while on patrol in southern
Iraq, the defence ministry in London said Thursday, taking the number of
British fatalities there this week to four.

The soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Irish Guards were killed and two
others were seriously injured by an improvised explosive device, which went
off just after midnight local time, the ministry said in a statement.

The four were travelling in a convoy to the north of the Rumaylah oilfields
to the west of the port city of Basra at the time.
