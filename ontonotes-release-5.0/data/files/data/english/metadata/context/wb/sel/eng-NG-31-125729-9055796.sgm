Essential Skills for Agile Development

Object-Oriented System Development
Object-oriented (OO) programming has a growing number of converts. Many people believe that object orientation will put a dent in the software crisis. There is a glimmer of hope that OO software development will become more like engineering. Objects, whatever they are now, may become for software what nuts, bolts and beams are for construction design, what 2-by-4s and 2-by-6s are for home construction, and what chips are for computer hardware construction.

Reverse Engineering Software
This book is an attempt to provide an introduction to reverse engineering software under both Linux and Microsoft Windows&amp;#65533;. The goal of this book is not to cover how to reproduce an entire program from a binary, but instead how to use the Scientific Method to deduce specific behavior and to target, analyze, extract and modify specific operations of a program, usually for interoperability purposes. As such, the book takes a top-down approach, starting at the highest level (program behavior) and drilling down to assembly when it is needed.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/2915

Software Architect
This book is about how individuals can take the lead in realigning our development efforts to that promise. In doing so, we shall in turn take our lead from the practice of Architecture, when Architects formed themselves into organisations determined to combat the problem of buildings falling on people’s heads.
http://www.bestebooksworld.com/ebook/2916

Agile Software Development
Is software development an art, a craft, science, engineering, or something else entirely? Does it even matter? Yes, it does matter, and it matters to you. Your actions and their results will differ depending on which of those is more correct.The main thing is you want your software out soon and relatively defect-free, but more than that, you need a way to examine how your team is doing along the way.

Artificial Intelligence through Prolog by Neil C. Rowe
Artificial intelligence is a hard subject to learn. I have written a book to make it easier. I explain difficult   concepts in a simple, concrete way.

Normally, 'digital' data input into a PC is just that – you use your digits; just two of them in my case, as I have never graduated beyond the two fingered school of typing.
