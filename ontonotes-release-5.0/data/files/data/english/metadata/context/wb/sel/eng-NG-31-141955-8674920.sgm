A Tribune staff report
Published: August 23, 2007

The 10-minute interruption of Thursday night's service at Without Walls
International Church, during which pastors Randy and Paula White announced
their impending divorce, wasn't a technical issue.

Viewers who tuned in to a live webcast of the service missed the
announcement; the video and audio were cut off for about 10 minutes.
Randy said Friday morning that he assumed the entire service would be
broadcast. But Paula's TV associates decided it should not be aired, so
the audio and video were cut.

Members of Without Walls International Church reacted with tears and a
chorus of &quot;Oh, no&quot; after the the founders and co-pastors of what has been
one of the nation's biggest and fastest-growing churches announced the
divorce at Thursday night's service.

Randy called Paula to the podium about an hour into the service. He was
somber; Paula appeared choked up.
&quot;It's the most difficult decision I've ever had to make in my entire
life,&quot; he told the congregation, describing Paula as an exceptional woman,
mother and preacher.

Paula has left Tampa for New York, and Randy plans church as usual on
Sunday.
She pledged to return frequently to preach.

Randy said he will file for the divorce as soon as their lawyers have
worked out details.
The most shaken members left the service and went into the entryway to cry
or call loved ones. Most said the news came as a shock, but it didn't shake
their faith in the ministry.
&quot;It's like hearing the news from your parents,&quot; said Frank Murillo, who
has attended the church for 10 years. &quot;They are great people. We all go
through stuff. Pastor Randy will be here, and I will be here.&quot;
Kerran Fuller has attended the church on and off since the beginning of
the year.
The announcement &quot;didn't weaken the church in anyway,&quot; he said after the
service. &quot;I'll definitely keep going.&quot;

The Whites, who've been married nearly 18 years, said in interviews that
the split is amicable and comes after visits to counselors over several
years.
They blame two lives going in different directions.
Randy, however, said he takes &quot;100 percent responsibility&quot; for the
breakup.
&quot;I want to apologize for the poor decisions I've made in my life, to my
congregation and to the body of Christ,&quot; he told The Tampa Tribune. &quot;I
think I've let a lot of people down.&quot;
Those regrets, he said, include how he has treated some people, lifestyle
changes and being seen in public with women other than his wife, even if
it was innocent.

He and Paula said the split involves no third party on either side.

Randy will stay at Without Walls as senior pastor while Paula concentrates
on her ministry, which includes a TV show broadcast on several national
networks including Black Entertainment Television, conferences, and book
and video sales.
She'll remain based in Tampa, with satellite operations in California, New
York City and San Antonio.
Church attendance &quot;will take a hit&quot; from the news, Randy predicted.
Without Walls reports having 23,000 members.

Its finances also will be affected: Paula's ministry brings in about
$50,000 to $80,000 a week, he said. An audit put total church revenues at
nearly $40 million last year.

Individual Pursuits

Although Paula will continue to financially support the church, the Whites
are in the process of separating operations.
The couple have pursued individual goals in recent months, rarely
preaching together at the church on North Grady Avenue near Raymond James
Stadium. They've also had to deal with the illness of Randy's grown
daughter, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor in December.
Paula, 41, is frequently on the road for her for-profit and nonprofit
ventures. One of those, Paula White Enterprises, changed earlier this year
when Randy's name was removed as a director, according to Department of
State records. In February, she created a new nonprofit, PWM Lifecenter,
listing as directors herself, church CFO Norva Carrington, and Rick
Hawkins, founding pastor of the Family Praise Center in San Antonio,
Texas.

She has made many speaking trips recently to San Antonio and this month
purchased a $681,000 home there. She serves as &quot;oversight pastor&quot; to
Hawkins' son Dustin, who now leads the church.
Paula also frequently travels to New York City, where she has a Trump
Tower condo and leads monthly services at her new Life by Design
Empowerment Center.

Randy, 49, has spent several months commuting to Malibu, Calif., where he
signed a one-year lease on a beachfront dwelling. He had told his
congregation he planned to start another church there, but now says those
plans are on hold.
This is the second marriage each for the Whites, who came to Tampa after
marrying in Maryland in March 1990. They have four grown children - three
from his previous marriage, one from hers.
Without Walls church board member Alick Clarke of Acton, Calif., a
longtime friend, said the impending divorce is sad news.
&quot;They were like my heroes. I really love them,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm also a
little pissed off. I didn't help them build their dream to have them throw
it all away.&quot;

An Australian-born businessman, Clarke said he's given hundreds of
thousands of dollars to the church since it was founded by the Whites in
1991 as the South Tampa Christian Center.
He partially blamed the couple's breakup on their devotion to preaching a
prosperity message, exhorting followers to give more money to the church
in order to be blessed with greater wealth.

&quot;Too many ministries have become big business. That message is desecrating
the church today,&quot; said Clarke, adding that he was disturbed to learn that
with revenues at $40 million last year, the church was $22 million in
debt.
&quot;That's just not right.&quot;

Other questions about the Whites' financial dealings arose in stories
published by the Tribune in May. Those included the couple's failure to
repay a $170,000 loan from an elderly widow, money borrowed in 1995 as a
down payment on a house. The couple sold the house in 2006, but still had
not repaid the loan to Ruth McGinnis by May.

This week, McGinnis told the Tribune that &quot;everything's been settled
financially between Pastor Randy and me.&quot;
Also in May, The Tribune wrote about a young mother who said she never
received the home she won in a widely publicized church contest in 2002.
On Aug. 15 she reported she and her four children had just moved into a
new home purchased by the church.

Money Matters

The Whites have declined to say what the church pays them.
Michael Chitwood, whose financial services company devised their
compensation package, said he recalled they have taken an annual salary as
high as $1.5 million collectively, though most years it's closer to
$600,000.
They were approved to take up to $3 million collectively, said the
president of Chitwood &amp; Chitwood of Tennessee.
Perhaps the most complex part of their divorce, being handled by Holland &amp;
Knight law firm, will be dividing up the assets, debts and business
interests.
The couple's home on Bayshore Boulevard has an assessed value of $2.22
million. They have a land trust that includes two Tampa houses with
assessed values of $144,800 and $257,835. The New York condo is valued at
about $3.5 million.
Their multimillion-dollar ministry includes a private jet.

Randy White has said much of their wealth comes from more than 23
successful business ventures, including real estate and his role as a
pitchman for Great HealthWorks' Omega XL fatty acid pills.
His main company, RAW Realty, is listed on his company Web site as being
housed at 100 S. Ashley Drive, Suite 1180, in Tampa, but a law firm
occupies that space. The state lists the company as being located at 2511
Grady Ave. in Tampa, which is the church address. The phone number on the
Web site and listed with the state is disconnected. E-mails sent to the
Web address were not returned.

White said this week the company is &quot;very much active&quot; in real estate,
residential acquisitions and other ventures, but he's pared it down to
himself and one assistant.

An 'Amazing' Start

Phil Cooke, a Los Angeles-based media strategist and consultant for
religious and nonprofit organizations, said he remembers when the couple
started their ministry.
&quot;What they did in Tampa's inner city was amazing,&quot; he said. &quot;They were
creative, sharp, innovative. The track they started out on was terrific.&quot;
The church had dozens of ministries that worked with disadvantaged
children, the homeless, people with substance abuse problems, single
mothers and others on society's fringe.
It put on Easter services in venues such as the Sun Dome, where thousands
were treated to giveaways and performances by stars such as Loretta Lynn,
Lee Greenwood and Patti LaBelle. The high energy and good works attracted
high-profile members including professional athletes and other local
celebrities.
As the church gained members and revenue, the pastors changed. Paula built
her international television ministry and became a life coach on &quot;The Tyra
Banks Show.&quot; Randy talked of performing nuptials for Kid Rock and Pamela
Anderson in Michigan (they filed for divorce a month later). He boasted
that he wasn't like &quot;religious&quot; people, posing in 2005 for a cover story
in Makes and Models magazine, a publication devoted to exotic cars,
motorcycles and scantily clad models. He has tattoos, collects guns and
enjoys wine.
At a Sunday service in April, he introduced his former personal trainer -
an attractive ex-porn star turned Christian - from the pulpit.
&quot;We're cutting edge,&quot; he told the Tribune that month. &quot;We do things a
little bit differently than what a typical ministry would do.&quot;
This week, White promised changes are in store for the church and
himself.
Without Walls will be less independent and more visible in the community,
he said. He wants to team with other ministries in the city.
For personal growth, he now has three &quot;accountability partners&quot; who will
help him concentrate on being a &quot;good dad and great pastor.&quot;

Recently, a Scottobite minion overheard a telephone conversation in which
Pastor Melissa Scott offered up these words of wisdom upon hearing the
news about the impending divorce of her professional competitive
associates of the prosperity gospel doctrine.  Pastor Melissa Scott was
overheard saying, &quot;Ditch the b*tch and make the switch.&quot;

The minion that recounted Melissa's telephone conversation can not be
confirmed as a completely reliable source, due to the fact that even
though the minion used his/her best efforts, he/she was still unable to
confirm whether Melissa offered her words of wisdom to Pastor Paula White
or to Pastor Randy White, on the other end of that telephone line.

There are some Youtube videos about the divorce

Very strange reaction from the congregation, almost
Scottbot-like. I mean, he could be slitting his
wrists up there, and they would clap and cheer for him.

My advice to Rev Randy:  Git some Pony Girls, and sit them down in the

The rule of thumb is that a husband never decides to leave the marriage
unless he's become involved with another woman (exceptions:  substance
abuse).

Let us quietly watch what develops.
