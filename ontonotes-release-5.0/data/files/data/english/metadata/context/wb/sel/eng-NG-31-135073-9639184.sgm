Hi
A little help please. I have a Beige desktop g3 (rev c), os 9.2.2,
applevision monitor.
I want to add usb/firewire pci cards to this machine. Alot of people
have done this.
My problem is if i add a pci card (I have three different adaptec
cards) to the beiege g3, I loose the monitor.
The monitor power light comes on briefly then goes out during start
up. no power to monitor.
I take the cards out and it is fine. Doesn't matter which cards I try
or which slot I put them in. Results are the same. Have done pram
reset and logic board reset, no help.

The first time I added a Adaptec duoconnect fireaire/usb card, it
seemed to work fine.
I put the system to sleep. Next morning, no monitor, no wake. Have
been unable to get the monitor to fire with a pci card in it ever
since. Do I have a problem with the mother board itself now?

thanks tom

I've got two Beige G3's and much experience with PCI cards in them,
including FW/USB Combo cards, and I've never seen or heard of your
symptoms. I'm no expert on Apple monitors, so perhaps I'm way off
base, but I thought the Applevision monitors had some type of ability
to retain resolution &amp; sleep preferences within the monitor itself,
and sometimes the monitor could get messed up? I think there is a
keyboard startup key command to reset the monitor, if I remember
correctly, it's Cmd-Opt-A-V? Perhaps this would work?

Sleep seems like a flakey thing in all Macs to me, and I never use it
myself, so perhaps that's why I've never seen your issue. I do tend
to read everything out there, and I've don't ever recall hearing
about this condition in the past, it must be rare.

I tried different monitors to no avail. two different applevision and
a old standard mac monitor. Results were the same. No monitor power on
with a pci card in any slot. BTW, using a &quot;wings&quot; av personality card.
Tried an original beige g3 av card, same result.

Try pulling the PRAM battery before startup AND resetting the CUDA switch.

With power off;
The CUDA is a small button usually around the processor . Reset with a
paintbrush handle or some use a skewer to reach  in.  Pressit and hold for a
minute to dump NVRAM .

The system will reset on start.

Since the Power Manager (PMU) runs off the PRAM Battery, this makes
no sense.  Pull the PRAM battery, wait a min, stick it back in, wait
a min (while the PMU boots etc) then hit the system boot button.

If you insert the PRAM Battery then hit the CUDA button ... you're
forcing a *second* boot of the PMU.  If you do that while the PMU is
already booting, then you unnecessarily drain the battery AND run the
risk of leaving the PMU is a bad state - that will then drain the
battery completely in just a few hours.

Would you agree that the NVRAM is what is preventing the display device
recognition?

And the CUDA reset is the main thing to go for in this situation?

No.  From the OP's description the monitor IS being recognized, it's
flicking on.  But then it's flicking off...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, mostly.

From the OP's description, I see two possibilities:

1) electrical problems with one or more PCI cards or slots or perhaps
the power supply itself.  Plugging in a card should NOT make a Rage
card go out to lunch.

2) a driver problem.

Once the PMU has seen the video card, the pram is set.  Done deal.
Fooling around with 'em more won't change anything.

As for &quot;the CUDA reset&quot;... rebooting the PMU should only be necessary
after the *core* configuration of the motherboard is changed.  eg:
replacing the processor or cache.  The PMU doesn't care what's
plugged into the PCI bus.  It just supplies power to the *bus*.  It's
the main system bootstrap, running off the main processor, that cares
what's on that bus.

The OP has not said *exactly* what cards are being installed, nor if
he's installed any drivers into OS 9 for them...

Do you get a bong? it may be that your power supply cannot supply
enough power for these cards if that is the case. Otherwise you likely
need to provide a extension in order for these cards to function
properly.

Thanks for the interest in this problem
Cards
all adaptec-
duoconnect
aua2000c
afw4300c
None of them let the monitor light up. This problem is happening
before any extensions load.(9.2.2, yes have the usb and firewire
extension).The first time I tried to install the duoconnect card was a
few monthes ago. It worked fine when I first installed it. It was late
so I put the computer to sleep and went to bed. In the morning the
monitor was off and would not wake. I forced a restart. The Beige g3
booted all the way to finder but would never turn the monitor on.Not
even a brief power on lite on the monitor.  Did a normal shutdown from
the keyboard, removed the duoconnect, everything was fine. Normal
chime on startup with or without pci cards.
Figured the pci board had gone bad. Recently got the other pci boards
to see if they would work. No joy as describe. This time the monitor
power lite would flash once and then nothing. (The monitor tube itself
never gets power to lite up)
Have replaced battery, zap pram, reset cuda, removed and reinstalled
ram, rom ,pmu cards. Computer works fine when no pci cards are
present.
Maybe a related problem. If I boot into OF, the g3 will not recognize
the reset typed commands, says words unknown. I am think that
something is wrong with the motherboard, maybe something to do with
pci slot control or something wrong with the bootstrap instructions
the machine is getting when pci cards are present.

Just to be sure the basics are covered, have you made sure that ALL PCI
slots, card edges, cable connectors and ports are thoroughly scrubbed
squeaky clean?

Contact cleaner and an old tooth brush can sometimes work wonders in
reviving circuit connections.

Sometimes we get so wrapped up in software problems and blown
solid state circuit scenarios in our heads we dismiss and overlook the KISS
principle.

Good suggestion, did it, didn't help. I found that on this beige g3
DT, the &quot;reset-nvram&quot; command in OF is incorrect. This machine must
have an older(?) OF.

This worked--

init-nvram   ok
set-default   ok
reset-all    restarted

these worked fine. machine restarted as it should.

put the usb pci card in (adaptec aua2000c), powered from keyboard.
monitor light glows breifly then nothing.

forced a restart and went to OF just fine. this was WITH the usb pci
card in place. Monitor powered on fine even with the pci card in
place. I then typed this----

init-nvram         worked
set-default        returned &quot;bad default&quot;
reset-all            worked (restarted.)

still no monitor power on

removed the pci card and beige g3 booted up just fine.

I am getting jealous of all the people with beige g3's that have no
trouble with pci cards.

One error here. The Beige G3 has a unique problem with the power
supply that makes it retain residual charge that can keep the PRAM/
NVRAM from resetting properly. This means the the normal Cmd-Opt-P-R
command followed by Cmd-Opt-O-F and the commands you did above
(actually I think the &quot;reset-all&quot; is enough, but you can never be too
sure?) are NOT good enough to always reset the PRAM &amp; NVRAM.

To be certain, you'll need to Shutdown and pull the PRAM battery.
Then disconnect the power supply cable to the motherboard, and press
the cuda reset button near the 3rd PCI slot. Wait about 5-10 minutes
and press the cuda again, then reconnect the power supply cable,
replace the PRAM battery and you &quot;SHOULD&quot; be back to default PRAM &amp;
NVRAM settings.

There was also a problem with some Beige having a bad voltage
regulator module (VRM) made by Royal Tech. If you have this module,
you'll need to get a replacement. See:
&lt; http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/index.cfm?page=zif/VRM.html &gt;

Another possible issue that is rare is the fact that the Beige has a
PCI 2.0 compliant PCI bus, and some newer PCI cards are not backwards
compliant to PCI 2.0 standards. I know this presented a problem with
some newer USB2/FW combo cards in the Beige, which were only
backwards compliant to PCI 2.1 standards, so you may need to check
your PCI cards to see if they're PCI 2.0 compliant or not?

Remember, that Rage video is part of the PCI bus and is shown in
System Profiler as &quot;PCI slot F1&quot; the 4th PCI slot. You should
probably buy a Radeon PCI card and permanently disable the onboard
Rage card using the instructions here:
&lt; http://forum.macsales.com/viewtopic.php?p=10280 &gt;

If you have a Radeon card, you can enable Quartz Extreme using PCI
Extreme 3.1 available at MacUpdate.com. I've got two Beige with G4
CPUs and Radeon 9100's (significantly quicker than the standard Mac
7000 or 9200) that have never had any issues with Quartz Extreme on
the PCI bus (with the Rage video disabled via Open Firmware commands).

Kris and All
Some great advise, thanks to all.

Do not have the Royal VRM

Did as you suggested, pulled battery , pulled power from MB, .....ect.

Still, with a usb pci card (adaptec aua 2000c), the monitor powers
momentarily then nothing, Remove the card and I am good.

A note of interest. The monitor power light comes on , then blinks off
a moment then back on.
this is when things boot up fine with no pci card.

With the pci card in, I get that first power on lite at the monitor
but it doesn't come back on.

I am starting to think that this Beige g3 just has a strange glitch in
it somewhere. Alot of people use usb/firesire pci cards in these
machines. Also remember, the first time I ever put a pci card in this
machine it worked fine. (card was a Adaptec Douconnect). I could read
and write to an external usb harddrive just fine. I then put the
machine to sleep overnight. In the morning I had this problem.

I don't think a new video card is worth the expense or trouble with
this rev c Beige DT G3.

I imagine everyone is running out of suggestions.
