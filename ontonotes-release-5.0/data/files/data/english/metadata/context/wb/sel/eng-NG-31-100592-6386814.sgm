Prologue

City of Angels

The city was hers for a single hour, just the one magic hour, only hers. The
morning of the accident, between three and four A.M. when the streets were
empty and the angels watched, she flew east on Wilshire Boulevard at eighty
miles per hour, never once slowing for the red lights along that stretch
called the Miracle Mile, red after red, blowing through lights without even
slowing; glittering blue streaks of mascara on her cheeks.

Accounting for her time before the accident, she would later tell police she
was at a club on Yucca in Hollywood, one of those clubs du jour with
paparazzi clotted by the door. She had spent an hour avoiding an aging
action star while seeing her friends (trust-fund Westsiders and A-list young
Hollywood; actors, agents, and musicians she had no problem naming for the
police), all taking cell-phone pictures of each other, blowing air-kisses
and posing with rainbow drinks. The police sergeant who interviewed her
would raise his eyebrows when she told him she had not been drinking, but
the Breathalyzer confirmed her story. One Virgin Cosmo which she did not
finish.

Three was her witching hour. She dropped a hundred on the valet for her
Aston Martin, and red-lined away. Five blocks later -- alone -- she stopped
in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard, shut the engine, and enjoyed a
cashmere breeze. The scents of jasmine and rosemary came from the hills. The
engine ticked, but she listened to find the silence. The stillness of the
city at this hour was breathtaking.

She gazed up at the buildings and imagined angels perched on the edge of the
roofs; tall slender angels with drooping wings; standing in perfect silence,
watching her without expectation as if in an eternal dream: We give you the
city. No one is watching. Set yourself free.

Her name was Larkin Conner Barkley. She was twenty-two years old. She lived
in a hip loft downtown in an area catering to emerging painters and
bicoastal musicians, not far from the Los Angeles River. Her family owned
the building.

Larkin pushed the accelerator and felt the wind lift her hair. She bore
south on Vine, then east on Wilshire, laughing as her eyes grew wet. Light
poles flicked past; red or green, it didn't matter and she didn't care.
Honking horns were lost in the rush. Her long hair, the color of pennies,
whipped and lashed. She closed her eyes, held them closed, kept them shut
even longer, then popped them wide and laughed that she still flew straight
and true --

-- 85 --

-- 90 --

-- 101 --

-- a two-hundred-thousand-dollar Tuxedo Black convertible blur, smudged by
alabaster skin and Medusa copper hair, running wild and free across the
city. She flashed over the arch at MacArthur Park, then saw the freeway
coming up fast, the Pasadena; a wall guarding downtown. She slowed, but only
enough, just barely enough, as cars appeared and streets narrowed, flying
over the freeway into the tangle of one-way downtown streets -- Sixth,
Seventh, Fourth, Ninth; Grand, Hill, and Main. She turned where she wanted,
went the wrong way, ran hard for the river; slowing more, finally,
inevitably, as everything rippled and blurred --

She told herself it was the dry night wind and lashing hair, the way her
eyes filled when her lonely race finished, but it was always the same
whether the air was dry or not, whether her hair was down or up, so she
knew. For those few minutes running across the city, she could be and was
herself, purely and truly herself, finding herself in those moments only to
lose herself once more when she slowed, falling behind as her true self ran
free somewhere ahead in the empty night --

She lurched across Alameda, her speed draining like a wound.

-- 65 --

-- 60 --

-- 55 --

Larkin turned north on an industrial street parallel to the river. Her
building was only blocks away when the air bag exploded. The Aston Martin
spun sideways to a stop. White powder hung in the air like haze; sprayed
over her shoulders and arms. The other car had been a flashing shape, no
more real than a shadow in the sea, a flick of gleaming movement broken by
the prisms of her tears, then the impact.

Larkin released her belt and stumbled from the car. A silver Mercedes sedan
was on the sidewalk, its rear fender broken and bent. A man and a woman were
in the front seat, the man behind the wheel. A second man was in the rear,
closest to the impact. The driver was helping the woman, whose face was
bleeding; the man in back was on his side, trying to pull himself up but
unable to rise.

Larkin slapped the driver's-side window.

"Are you all right? Can I help?"

The driver stared at her blankly before truly seeing her, then opened his
door. He was cut above his left eye.

Larkin said, "Ohmigod, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'll call 911. I'll get an
ambulance."

The driver was in his fifties, well dressed and tan, with a large gold ring
on his right hand and a beautiful watch on his left. The woman stared dumbly
at blood on her hands. The backseat passenger spilled out the rear door,
fell to his knees, then used the side of the car to climb to his feet.

He said, "We're okay. It's nothing."

Larkin realized her cell phone was still in her car. She had to get help for
these people.

"Please sit down. I'll call --"

"No. Let me see about you."

The man from the backseat took a step but sank to a knee. Larkin saw him
clearly, lit by the headlights of her car. His eyes were large, and so dark
they looked black in the fractured light.

Larkin hurried to her car. She found her cell phone on the floor, and was
dialing 911 when the Mercedes backed off the sidewalk, its rear fender
dragging the street.

Larkin said, "Hey, wait --!"

Larkin called after them again, but they didn't slow. She was memorizing
their license plate when she heard the man from the backseat running away
hard up the middle of the street.

A tinny voice cut through her confusion.

"Emergency operator, hello?"

"I had a wreck, an auto accident --"

"Was anyone injured?"

"They drove away. This man, I don't know --"

Larkin closed her eyes and recited the license number. She was scared she
would forget it, so she pulled out her lip gloss -- Cherry Pink Ice -- and
wrote the number on her arm.

"Ma'am, do you need help?"

Larkin felt wobbly.

"Ma'am --?"

The earth tilted and Larkin sat in the street.

"Ma'am, tell me where you are."

Larkin tried to answer.

"Ma'am, where are you?"

Larkin lay back on the cool, hard street. Dark buildings huddled over her
like priests in black frocks, bent over in prayer. She searched their roofs
for angels.

The first patrol car arrived in seven minutes; the paramedics three minutes
later. Larkin thought it would end that night when the police finished their
questions, but her nightmare had only begun.

In forty-eight hours, she would meet with agents from the Department of
Justice and the U.S. Attorney's. In six days, the first attempt would be
made on her life. In eleven days, she would meet a man named Joe Pike.

Everything in her world was about to change. And it began that night.

***

Day One
Stay Groovy

1

The girl was moody getting out of the car, making a sour face to let him
know she hated the shabby house and sun-scorched street smelling of chili
and episote. To him, this anonymous house would serve. He searched the
surrounding houses for threats as he waited for her, clearing the area the
way another man might clear his throat. He felt obvious wearing the
long-sleeved shirt. The Los Angeles sun was too hot for the sleeves, but he
had little choice. He moved carefully to hide what was under the shirt.

She said, "People who live in houses like this have deformed children. I can't
stay here."

"Lower your voice."

"I haven't eaten all day. I didn't eat yesterday and now this smell is
making me feel strange."

"We'll eat when we're safe."

The house opened as the girl joined him, and the woman Bud told him to
expect appeared: a squat woman with large white teeth and friendly eyes
named Imelda Arcano. Mrs. Arcano managed several apartment houses and
single-family rentals in Eagle Rock, and Bud's office had dealt with her
before. He hoped she wouldn't notice the four neat holes that had been
punched into their fender the night before.

He turned his back to the house to speak with the girl.

"The attitude makes you memorable. Lose it. You want to be invisible."

"Why don't I wait in the car?"

Leaving her was unthinkable.

"Let me handle her."

The girl laughed.

"That would be you all over it. I want to see that, you handling her. I want
to see you charm her."

He took the girl's arm and headed toward the house. To her credit, the girl
fell in beside him without making a scene, slouching to change her posture
the way he had shown her. Even with her wearing the oversize sunglasses and
Dodgers cap, he wanted her inside and out of sight as quickly as possible.

Mrs. Arcano smiled wider as they reached the front door, welcoming them.

"Mr. Johnson?"

"Yes."

"It's so hot today, isn't it? It's cool inside. The air conditioner works
very well. I'm Imelda Arcano."

After the nightmare in Malibu, Bud's office had arranged the new house on
the fly -- dropped the cash and told Mrs. Arcano whatever she needed to
hear, which probably wasn't much. This would be easy money, no questions
part of the deal, low-profile tenants who would be gone in a week. Mrs.
Arcano probably wouldn't even report the rental to the absentee owner; just
pocket Bud's cash and call it a day. They were to meet Mrs. Arcano only so
she could give them the keys.

Imelda Arcano beckoned them inside. The man hesitated long enough to glance
back at the street. It was narrow and treeless, which was good. He could see
well in both directions, though the small homes were set close together,
which was bad. The narrow alleys would fill with shadows at dusk.

He wanted Mrs. Arcano out of the way as quickly as possible, but Mrs. Arcano
latched onto the girl -- one of those female-to-female things -- and gave
them the tour, leading them through the two tiny bedrooms and bath, the
microscopic living room and kitchen, the grassless backyard. He glanced at
the neighboring houses from each window, and out the back door at the rusty
chain-link fence that separated this house from the one behind it. A beige
and white pit bull was chained to an iron post in the neighboring yard. It
lay with its chin on its paws, but it was not sleeping. He was pleased when
he saw the pit bull.

The girl said, "Does the TV work?"

"Oh, yes, you have cable. You have lights, water, and gas -- everything you
need, but there is no telephone. You understand that?"

"There really is no point in having the phone company create a line for such
a short stay."

He had told the girl not to say anything, but now they were having a
conversation. He cut it off.

"We have cell phones. You can hand over the keys and be on your way."

Mrs. Arcano stiffened, indicating she was offended.

"When will you be moving in?"

"Now. We'll take the keys."

Mrs. Arcano peeled two keys from her key ring, then left. For the first and
only time that day he left the girl alone. He walked Mrs. Arcano to her car
because he wanted to bring their gear into the house as quickly as possible.
He wanted to call Bud. He wanted to find out what in hell happened the night
before, but mostly he wanted to make sure the girl was safe.

He lingered at his car until Mrs. Arcano drove away, then looked up and down
the street again -- both ways, the houses, between the houses -- and
everything seemed fine. He brought his and the girl's duffels into the
house, along with the bag they had grabbed at the Rite Aid.

The television was on, the girl hopping through the local stations for news.
When he walked in, she laughed, then mimicked him, lowering and flattening
her voice.

"'Hand over the keys and be on your way.' Oh, that charmed her. That
certainly made you forgettable."

He turned off the television and held out the Rite Aid bag. She didn't take
it, pissed about him turning off the set, so he let it drop to the floor.

"Do your hair. We'll get something to eat when you're finished."

"I wanted to see if we're on the news."

"Can't hear with the TV. We want to hear. Maybe later."

"I can turn off the sound."

"Do the hair."

He peeled off his shirt and tossed it onto the floor by the front door. If
he went out again or someone came to the door he would pull it on. He was
wearing a Kimber .45 semiautomatic pushed into the waist of his pants. He
opened his duffel and took out a clip holster for the Kimber and a second
gun, this one already holstered, a Colt Python .357 Magnum with the
four-inch barrel. He clipped the Kimber onto the front of his pants in the
cross-draw position and the Python on his right side. He hadn't chanced the
holsters with Mrs. Arcano, but he hadn't wanted to take the chance of being
without a gun, either.

He took a roll of duct tape from his bag and went to the kitchen.

Behind him, the girl said, "Asshole."

He made sure the back door was locked, then moved to the tiny back bedroom,
locked the windows, and pulled the shades. This done, he tore off strips of
duct tape and sealed the shades over the windows. He taped the bottoms and
sides to the sills and jambs, all the way around each shade. If anyone
managed to raise a window they would make noise tearing the shade from the
wall and he would hear. When the shades were taped, he took out his Randall
knife and made a three-inch vertical slit in each shade, just enough for him
to finger open so he could cover the approaches to the house. He was cutting
the shades when he heard her go into the bathroom. Finally cooperating. He
knew she was scared, both of him and of what was happening, so he was
surprised she had been trying as hard as she had. And pleased, thinking
maybe they would stay alive a little while longer.

On his way to the front bedroom he passed the bath. She was in front of the
mirror, cutting away her rich copper hair. She held the hair between her
fingers, pulling it straight from her head to hack it away with the cheap
Rite Aid scissors, leaving two inches of jagged spikes. Boxes of Clairol
hair color, also fresh from the Rite Aid, lined the sink. She saw him in the
mirror and glared.

"I hate this. I'm going to look so Melrose."

She had peeled down to her bra but left the door open. He guessed she wanted
him to see. The five-hundred-dollar jeans rode low on her hips below a
smiling dolphin jumping between the dimples on the small of her back. Her
bra was light blue and sheer, and the perfect color against her olive skin.
Looking at him, she played with her hair, which now stuck out in uneven
spikes. She fluffed the spikes, shaped them, then considered them. The sink
and floor were covered with the hair she had cut away.

She said, "What about white? I could go white. Would that make you happy?"

"Brown. Nondescript."

"I could go blue. Blue might be fun."

She turned to pose her body.

"Would you love it? Retropunk? So totally Melrose? Tell me you love it."

He continued on to the front bedroom without answering. She hadn't bought
blue. She probably thought he hadn't been paying attention, but he paid
attention to everything. She had bought blond, brown, and black. He locked
and taped the front bedroom windows as he had done in the rest of the house,
then returned to the bathroom. Now the water was running and she was leaning
over the sink, wearing clear plastic gloves, massaging color into her hair.
Black. He wondered how long it would take for the red to be hidden. He took
out his cell phone, calling Bud Flynn as he watched.

He said, "We're in place. What happened last night?"

"I'm still trying to find out. I got no idea. Is the new house okay?"

"They had our location, Bud. I want to know how."

"I'm working on it. Is she okay?"

"I want to know how."

"Jesus, I'm working on it. Do you need anything?"

"I need to know how."

He closed the phone as she stood, water running down the trough of her spine
to the dolphin until she wrapped her hair in a towel. Only then did she find
him in the mirror again and smile.

"You're looking at my ass."

The pit bull barked.

He did not hesitate. He drew the Python and ran to the back bedroom.

She said, "Joe! Damnit."

In the back bedroom, he fingered open a slit in the shade as the girl
hurried up behind him. The dog was on its feet, squinting at something he
could not see.

She said, "What is it?"

"Shh."

The pit was trying to see something to their left, the flat top of its head
furrowed and its nubby ears perked, no longer barking as it tested the air.

Pike watched through the slit, listening hard as the pit was listening.

The girl whispered, "What?"

The pit exploded with frenzied barking as it jumped against its chain.

Pike spoke fast over his shoulder even as the first man came around the end
of the garage. It was happening again.

"Front of the house, but don't open the door. Go. Fast."

The towel fell from her head as he pushed her forward. He hooked their
duffels over his shoulder, guiding her to the door. He checked the slit in
the front window shade. A single man was walking up the drive as another
moved across the yard toward the house. Pike didn't know how many more were
outside or where they were, but he and the girl would not survive if he
fought from within the house.

He cupped her face and forced her to see him. She had to see past her fear.
Her eyes met his and he knew they were together.

"Watch me. Don't look at them or anything else. Watch me until I motion for
you, then run for the car as fast as you can."

Once more, he did not hesitate.

He jerked open the door, set up fast on the man in the drive, and fired the
Colt twice. He reset on the man coming across the yard. Pike doubled on each
man's center of mass so quickly the four shots sounded like two --
baboombaboom -- then he ran to the center of the front yard. He saw no more
men, so he waved out the girl.

"Go."

She ran as hard as she could, he had to hand it to her. Pike fell in behind
her, running backwards the way cornerbacks fade to cover a receiver, staying
close to shield her body with his because the pit bull was still barking.
More men were coming.

When Pike reached the bodies, he dropped to a knee and checked their pockets
by touch. He was hoping for a wallet or some form of ID, but their pockets
were empty.

A third man came around the corner of the house into the drive, saw Pike,
then dove backwards. Pike fired his last two shots. Wood and stucco exploded
from the edge of the house, but the man had made cover and the Python was
dry. The third man popped back almost at once and fired three shots --
bapbapbap -- missing Pike, but hitting his Jeep like a ball-peen hammer.
Pike didn't have time to holster the Python. He dropped it to jerk free the
Kimber, pounded out two more shots and dropped the man at the edge of the
house. Pike ran for the car. The girl had the driver's door open, but was
just standing there.

Pike shouted, "Get in. In."

Another man appeared at the edge of the house, snapping out shots as fast as
he could. Pike fired, but the man had already taken cover.

"In."

Pike pushed the girl across the console, jammed the key into the ignition
and gunned his Jeep to the corner. He four-wheeled the turn, buried the
accelerator, then glanced at the girl.

"You good? Are you hurt?"

She stared straight ahead, her eyes red and wet. She was crying again.

She said, "Those men are dead."

Pike placed his hand on her thigh.

"Larkin, look at me."

She clenched her eyes and kneaded her hands.

"Three men just died. Three more men."

He made his deep voice soft.

"I won't let anything happen to you. Do you hear me?"

She still didn't look.

"Do you believe me?"

She nodded.

Pike swerved through an intersection. He slowed only enough to avoid a
collision, then accelerated onto the freeway.

They had been at the house in Eagle Rock for twenty-eight minutes. He had
killed three more men, and now they were running. Again.

He was sorry he lost the Colt. It was a good gun. It had saved them last
night in Malibu, but now it might get them killed.
