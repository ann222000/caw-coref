Swamiji says "dharti ki sanjivini hai kapal-bhati pranayam" and that it "cures all diseases of world".

Detailed Procedure
‘Kapal’ means forehead and ‘Bhati’ means light. Hence, Kapal-Bhati? refers to that exercise which makes the forehead luminous and lustrous. Kapal-Bhati? Pranayama makes its Sadhak’s head luminous. This Pranayama is a little different from Bhastrika Pranayama. In Bhastrika Pranayama, Puraka and Recak are done with the same amount of force, where as in Kapal-Bhati? more attention is to be given to the act of forceful Recak. In Kapal-Bhati?, the Puraka is to be done with normal, usual force but the Recak has to be done with as much of force as is at your command. In doing so, the abdominal area, also makes inward and outward movements and considerable force is applied to the Manipura,Svadhisthana and Muladhara Chakra. This Pranayama should easily be done for five minutes. In short, breathe in normally and breathe out forcefully, so as to influence the organs of the abdominal area. Persons suffering from acute and chronic diseases must practice if for 15 minutes or more as per the capability.

Shiva Sankalpa (Vow) at the time of performing Kapal-Bhati:
While doing this Pranayama think that while exhaling you are throwing all the diseases out of your body. Individuals with mental aberrations like anger, greed, self-ego attachment etc. should develop a feeling of throwing out all the negative and injurious elements along with the air exhaled. In this way the feeling of getting rid of diseases while exhaling imparts a special benefit to the individual.

Duration:
Do this Pranayama at the start for a period of three minutes and gradually increase it to five minutes. Initially, if you feel tired in between, take rest for a while and resume. After practice of about two months, you will be able to perform this Pranayama for five minutes at a stretch without any fatigue. This is the total duration for which it should be done. In the beginning, you may feel a little pain in the back or abdomen. But this will disappear after some practice. So do not give up. People whose glands secrete lots of bile inside the body are termed as Pitta Prakriti. They should not do this Pranayama for more than 2 minutes during summer season.

Benefits:
a.. Face become Lustrous and attractive.
b.. Diseases related to Kapha like asthma, respiratory troubles, allergies, sinus, etc. are cured.
c.. Diseases of heart, lungs and brain get cured.
d.. Obesity, diabetes, flatulence, constipation, acidity and diseases pertaining to kidneys and prostate glands etc. are cured.
e.. If done regularly for five minutes daily, it relieves constipation, Blood sugar becomes normal and weight in the abdominal region reduces considerably. Blockages in the arteries are also cleared.
f.. Peace and stability of mind are achieved. No negative thoughts occur. Troubles like depression are cured.
g.. Chakras are purified and ¡¡chakras from Muladhar-Chakra to Sahsrar Chakra are filled with pious Cosmic Energy.
h.. Organs in the abdominal cavity viz. stomach, pancreas, liver, spleen, intestine, prostrate and kidney function more efficiently and develop immunity towards diseases. This is the best exercise; benefits accrued by this cannot be obtained by several other asanas. It strengthens the intestines and improves digestion.
