On Monday afternoon I have an appointment I've long looked forward to:
With a psychiatrist who not only has 20 years' experience with
schizophrenics but a strong interest in adult Asperger's. My regular
pdoc referred me to him to help refine my diagnosis and triangulate on
treatment options.

At my psychotherapy appointment I told my pdoc that it's like I was
bombed to rubble at birth and have been eking out an existence in the
ruins for 40 years, and now I'm starting to rebuild. I suggested to
him that it might take me three or four years of weekly psychotherapy
appointments plus other treatment to get to where I want to be with
myself. He did the Gaelic shrug and said &quot;We're not in a hurry here.&quot;

I meant to say that my psychologist is like a great friend to talk to.

I've been in psychotherapy for 12 years and I didn't develop paranoid
schizophrenia until my 30s.  My psychologist says it's a chronic
condition so I'll need supportive therapy indefinitely.

It's good to have a therapist who's patient and understanding. But it
looks very much like I shan't be unemployable forever. The way I'm
living now is bringing me ever closer to happiness. Most of my issues
have to do with me not having my own place, and I expect that to be
resolved sooner rather than later.
