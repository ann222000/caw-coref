Hi folks.

Finally got Leopard installed this evening.  Straight upgrade install,
must've taken around 70 - 80 minutes or so.  Fantastic so far and I'd
guess a slight performance improvement.  Very happy that features like
Cover Flow work as well (FAST) on this old G4 PowerMac as they did on
the preview videos.

Now, the Firewall looks entirely different to what I was used to in Tiger.

It was set to 'Allow all incoming connections'.  Is 'Block all incoming
connections' much the same as having the firewall turned on in 10.4?
'Set access for specific services and applications' looks rather similar
to what Little Snitch does.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Andy.

I've found the settings to be unreliable. Trying to start iChat screen
sharing with it set to &quot;Set access&quot; didn't ask me if I wanted to unblock
until I restarted.

And even then, the firewall log shows it denying what I told it to allow.

Nobody seems to be sure yet what is up with Leopard's firewall, but it

From the discussion of that article I've seen it is not as bad as all
that.  But this isn't a good start.  Still there are reasons to believe
that the author of that article (and me and loads of other people) have
failed to understand the network security model in Leopard.  I'm waiting
for the dust to settle and until I become more confident in my
understanding of new firewall.  I am a strong supporter of having both a
host based firewall and a perimeter firewall.  Given my utter bafflement
of what Apple is up to here, I'm looking relying on my perimeter firewall
to do this job at the moment.

Leopard really does introduce a number of security enhancements very deep
in the system.  And it may be that the new firewall design is set to
coordinate with that.

Alternatively, this could be that Apple sacrificed security just to get
Leopard out by the once-postponed release date and make sure that it &quot;Just
worked&quot; for most users.  I would be really, really pissed off if that
turns out to be the case, but I have to acknowledge that it remains a
possibility.

Then it is not a good security model.

Nice for home and office use, but when you're on the road with a
notebook, lugging around an external firewall seems to be a bit
cumbersome. Not to speak of the fact that most cheap routers with a
firewall are just running some Linux, which gets never updated and may
be quite full of exploitable holes after a while.

Yeah, but still the GUI should clearly reflect the state the firewall
has. Having the system under the hood punching wholes through it at will
and without notice (if it does that, I don't know that much yet) is not
what a good security model makes.

The old firewall and GUI seemed to &quot;just work&quot;, didn't it?

I have always upgraded to the 10.N.0 versions and never noticed any
problems whatsoever.  So I never really took much notice of those who said
that they wait for the 10.N.1 versions before upgrading.  However, with
Leopard, there have been enough things that really show that it was rushed
to meet the deadline.  So in this case, I would recommend waiting for
10.5.1 unless you have a pressing need for Leopard features.

I should say that all of my update installs went well overall, but there
still are things that have gotten to me.   For example, the new Address
Book seems to have merged all of  my &quot;No Name&quot; entries into one.

I seem to be the only person who doesn't mind stacks, but that seems to be
because prior to Stacks, I never kept folders in the Dock (I did put some
in Finder's sidebar.)  I also don't know what a &quot;spring loaded&quot; folder is
supposed to be anyway.

Cheers,

Yep.  I currently have it set to 'Block all incoming connections', but I
have no idea if it's actually doing anything.  Quite clearly it's _not_
blocking all incoming connections, whether it be Apple software (Safari)
or that dirty bit of kit &quot;LimeWire&quot;.  If it's blocking all UNWANTED
incoming connections, then well and good.

Clicking the 'Advanced' tab brings up a screen which allows me to enable
logging and Stealth Mode (checked), but when I try 'Open Log...'
absolutely nothing happens.

It looks like Little Snitch gets turned back on, and I'll just have to
keep clearing popups caused by 'kernal_task&quot; doing various things for a
little while longer.

While I've never been a fan of dumbing things down to the most basic
level, for something as important as a firewall the interface seems
entirely user unfriendly.

And no, RTFM didn't enlighten me much at all.

OK, quick update.

The log now works, and I already have entries such as the following:

Nov  2 08:39:46 Macintosh Firewall[38]: Stealth Mode connection attempt
to UDP 10.1.1.2:14358 from 24.71.89.164:45351

So it's doing something, but the interface still irks me.

I've got a 12&quot; PowerBook G4 1GHz and 768MB of RAM. After Spotlight
re-indexing and initial Time Machine backup, performance is pretty much
par -- some things are faster, some slower. I can't say I've really
noticed any change.

(I find performance of Time Machine very bad on my 1st gen Intel mini,
but it's quite acceptable on the PB. Weird, that. Maybe it's because the
PowerBook turns down the sexiness of the display.)

What incoming connections go to Safari?  Web browsers normally do
everything with outgoing connections.

Dual 1GHz, 1.75GB RAM, 160BG HD.

I'm not sure how the single processor machines fare.  It does use a
little extra RAM, 14% used on booting as opposed to 9% with Tiger.

It's a convenient way to get things where you want them
once you develop the skill.  Long ago, I neither knew
what it was, nor knew that it was on.  So the first time
I went too slow dragging an icon across the screen,
a folder in the path popped open, startling me so that
I dropped what I was dragging.  All the folders promptly
closed back up and I had to go searching for what I had dropped.
