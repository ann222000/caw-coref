Well, I only watched the first hour.

The host said he was the host of Australian Idol. I found his accent
extremely annoying. It was almost as if he were exaggerating his Ozzy-ness.

The rock-star (Goo-Goo dolls) judge seemed clueless. He was obviously
trying to be Randy J.

The female judge was bland, but at least she didn't try to be Paula.

The Australian judge was doing his best to out-Simon Simon. However, it
felt just a bit too forced, as did a lot of the banter and arguments
between the judges.

As far as the talent: the ones I liked were dismissed. The ones I didn't
like were given the golden ticker (or whatever the equivalent was). The
Zombie/undead band was by far the best (which should tell you something
immediately). The rest were overhyped and undertalented. The other
highlight was the armless guy who played guitar with his feet (but not
for their song or performance - the armless guy did a great job, but his
voice was lacking, and the rest of the band was amateurish at best -
that band didn't make it through).

After the lead singer of one band massacred Matchbox Twenty's &quot;Long
Day&quot;, and then got praised for it (the band itself was badly panned), I
turned it over to the far more interesting &quot;Moonlight&quot;. I did feel
better, though, when that band didn't make it through.

&lt;Waving hand&gt; me, I was!  The kid band was great, so were the country and
blue-grass bands and the pop band (The Hatch, I think?).  But either most of
them sucked or the sound system really sucked - I couldn't decide which.

Well, Holy-Moley...am I the ONLY one that actually LIKED this show
tonight?! My 30+ year old daughter and I watched it together and we both
really liked it! First it's a BIG plus to finally have something to
watch on Friday nights!  Did feel sorry for them out  in the triple
digit temps auditioning...strange place to pick in the summer?!

I didn't record it, so couldn't go back and watch/listen to some of the
particulars, so did it say they chose 60 bands to audition for them,
from tapes that were submitted? Then....they choose 12, and next week
the voting will begin? At least they didn't put us through a bunch of
&quot;crap-shoot&quot; auditions, like they did the last season of A.I.!  :-(

I thought the fellow from the Goo Goo Dolls was a good judge...reminds
me a lot of Dave Nivara, when he was judging Rock Star and I think
Sheila E was a good judge too, and other fellow wasn't too bad either,
but he was the one that swung the axe the most. I liked the host...love
his accent!

My favorite  band was Dot Dot Dot. but also like the &quot;edgy country&quot;
Nashville band (Six Wire) and I thought Denver &amp; The Mile High Band was
very good, and also the one with the Blue Grass sound (Cliff Wagoner and
Old Number 7) and  thought the lead singer in the black band (Franklin
Bridge) was GREAT.  The group of 12 year olds (Light Of Doom?) and
Rocket (all-gal's band) show potential.

Anyway....I'm very much looking forward to seeing these bands next
Friday night, and hearing more of what they have to offer!

&gt; Shoot, Friday night is my favorite TV night and I couldn't fit in
&gt; another show.  Friday is WWE Wrestling, Flash Gordon, and Stargate
&gt; Atlantis.

&gt; It doesn't get much better than that!  :-D

Except for the WWE Wrestling, Flash Gordon, and Stargate. :P

Flash Gordon is one of the worst things on TV. It repeatedly gets panned
in the 5 Star Poll at rec.arts.tv (almost as badly as Bionic Woman
does). I watched the first three episodes, and gave up.

Atlantis is a very pale shade of SG1. I only watch it out of habit.

Friday night used to be &quot;must see TV&quot; for me. Now, it doesn't offer much
worth watching.

No, somewhat surprisingly I enjoyed it, somewhat  as well.  Lythgoe has
said, finally, that there is some concern about how to get the
backstories out that made AI so successful which will be a challenge.
The Friday night timeslot, though...kiss of death.  It will have the
complete run through because FOX won't do anything to rile the Brits.
They are like Spielberg w/ Fox.

I thought the show had some heart and soul.  The Goo-Goo guy was, by
far, IMHO, the weakest/lamest judge.  The challenge will be to see if
weeks 2 and 3 keep my interest.

I haven't watched it yet, but I will at some point this weekend.
Wanted to report, however, that it was surprisingly trounced in the
ratings.  It came in dead last in its timeslot with a 2.2/4 average.
It's doing worse than the reruns of K-Ville that were previously in
its spot.

No idea what this is going to mean for the show.  They may just let it
play out to the finish due to the impending writers strike and to make
nice with Nigel Lythgoe.  With competition reality shows like this,
they usually bring them to some sort of conclusion, even in a
truncated form (like On the Lot or the second season of Rock Star.)

I'm really kind of shocked at the awfulness of the ratings, but I said
all along that they weren't hyping the show enough.

He WAS good, if you mean the fellow that climbed the tower in the first
audition, and they were asked to come back and try again, as the judges
did want to give them another chance? I can't think of the name of the
band, but I sure thought HE was great, but the others just weren't up to
par with him. I have an idea he'll be grabbed up by another band

It sounded like the auditions are done now and next week they have the
12 bands final bands that will be competing.  And there is a lot of

Are you kidding?  They were the one group I thought shouldn't have been
put through that was. They struck me as a novelty act and now we've seen
their act.  Maybe they've got more, but I'd be surprised.  I was
surprised at how many really good bands there were - they just probably
weren't your cup of tea: the bluegrass band, the country band with the
guy who played slide guitar, the Mugs (the old rock n rollers), the big
band and probably more I can't remember.  There are enough that were

end of the road for us if we don't make it through&quot; schtick.  And when
they didn't make it through and he was asked if this was really the end,
he says &quot;I don't know.&quot;  So in other words all that other drama was just
a bunch of lies?

the overall power of his voice. I don't think he should quit. He should just
quit that band.

I'm even thinking he could turn up on AI.

CBS has had Fridays locked up for a few seasons now with Ghost
Whisperer and Numbers, however this season, Women's Murder Club on ABC
has drawn very good ratings in its two outings thus far.  Still,
Friday is in danger of becoming the vast wasteland that Saturday is,
which would really suck.  Remember back when Saturdays ruled with The
Love Boat and Fantasy Island, or even further back with All in the
Family, Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart and Carol Burnett?  And Fridays
had Dallas and Falcon Crest and The ABC Friday Night Movie.

I'm glad I wasn't the only one that thought he reminded me of Chris....
was thinking maybe I just had a overactive imagination-ha!  He was WAY
better than his band mates, and bet that will put a wedge between them

through...because of him mainly!

So do you think the low ratings for the pilot is a combination of it
being on Friday night and also because it wasn't  promoted enough ahead
of time?  I'd actually heard quite a bit about it ahead of time, and was
all physiced up to watch it, but I was concerned because of the time
slot it was given. Maybe with the new fall line up, the other nights of
the week were filled up in Prime Time spots?!  I sure would like to see
it make a go of it, as I'm only watching two new shows (Kid Nation and
Life) as the others just seem &quot;lame&quot; to me!

They were so much better than the rest that they felt a little like a
plant. They said they had a record deal previously and released a
couple of singles that didn't go anywhere, so they have experience and
it showed. And the fact that the lead singer looked like Josh Holloway
from LOST won't hurt them.

There's always the issue of marketability and that will probably be
the stumbling block for some of the more novel bands (blue grass and
swing), because even though there are fans of those jondras out there,
I doubt those those fans are watching this show. The rocker kids will
probably wear thin and I'm already irritated by the girl group Rocket,
who act like they are the first girl group ever and annoyingly keep
saying they are going to Rock-et).

Once you eliminate the overly dramatic and the angsty, Six Wire stands
a very good chance. They aren't my type of music, but I could see them
stepping right into the country-pop-rock scene, touring with Carrie
Underwood or Rascal Flats or Faith Hill, people like that.

I didn't realize all those shows were on Friday's and Saturday's. It really
demonstrates how times have changed since my parents would sit home and
watch TV on the weekend. Half the time I decide to take a trip to Atlantic
City it's because I can't bear to watch what's on the current weekend
schedule. And we have far more choices in terms of channels than they did.

I saw a promo for WMC, but it didn't interest me. But since you say people
are watching it, maybe I'll give the next episode a shot.

&gt;&gt; &quot;crap-shoot&quot; auditions, like they did the last season of A.I.!  :-(

YES!! I enjoyed the &quot;camp&quot; of the whole thing for one two-hour show. It was
dopey and cheezy enough. They also had the opportunity to show a couple
&quot;feel good&quot; stories.
The 12 they picked seemed about right and a good mix.

&gt;&gt; I thought the fellow from the Goo Goo Dolls was a good judge...reminds
&gt;&gt; me a lot of Dave Nivara, when he was judging Rock Star and I think
&gt;&gt; Sheila E was a good judge too, and other fellow wasn't too bad either,
&gt;&gt; but he was the one that swung the axe the most. I liked the host...love

Except for tattoos, I'm not seeing much similar about John Resznick and Dave
Navarro. While I think he's OK, John is sort of Rock Star Light. Sheila E.
was OK. I thought it was sort of lame when she ran up and took over the
drums and then they booted the latino band. I would have liked to have
seen/heard what she said to that fat, Kiss-wannabee guy that told her, &quot;We
can't all play with Prince&quot;. Dicko was cool and knows what he's talking
about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I loved these guys, they might have been my favorite of all of them.

&gt;&gt; and also the one with the Blue Grass sound (Cliff Wagoner and
&gt;&gt; Old Number 7)

&gt; they were terrific

&gt;&gt; and  thought the lead singer in the black band (Franklin

I was not expecting them to be as good as they were. They'll definitely be
one of the ones to beat.

&gt;&gt; The group of 12 year olds (Light Of Doom?)

&gt; I'm glad they put them through, just because I want to see more of what
&gt; they can actually do; but I do agree with the Aussie judge who thought
&gt; that once you get past the gimmick that they aren't good enough.

I sort of got a creepy vibe about them.....sort of like the kiddie beauty
pageant thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; Rocket (all-gal's band) show potential.

I was surprised at the blunt comment about the one gal being hot. They could

It could make a big difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; they were OK, but the lead singer needs a fire lit under her

&gt;&gt; Anyway....I'm very much looking forward to seeing these bands next
&gt;&gt; Friday night, and hearing more of what they have to offer!
">

I think it will be fun. It couldn't hurt to have the American public be
exposed to some varying types of music. I was really impressed by the guys
who were brothers from TN....sons of the travelling preacher with 11 kids
....or something like that. The one guy was amazing on the dobro. I liked
the guys from Detroit...The Fuggs ....or something like that. Definitely old
school and a great story. There was another band that made it that we didn't
really get to see, only a clip. The lead singer sort of looked like a cross
between the lead singers from Linkin Park and Live. I'm sure we'll be able
to judge and focus more next week.

How are they going to do the voting? Right now I'm drawing a blank on how
they did it for Rockstar. Switching to Pockstar, I saw a bulletin from Storm
( from Storm and the Balls). Evidently, Lukas is free of his ties to the
show and RSSN. I just hope they bring back that show. The problem is, they
need a serious band who needs a singer.

&gt; &gt; enough.

&gt; So do you think the low ratings for the pilot is a combination of it
&gt; being on Friday night and also because it wasn't  promoted enough ahead
&gt; of time?  I'd actually heard quite a bit about it ahead of time, and was
&gt; all physiced up to watch it, but I was concerned because of the time
&gt; slot it was given. Maybe with the new fall line up, the other nights of
&gt; the week were filled up in Prime Time spots?!  I sure would like to see
&gt; it make a go of it, as I'm only watching two new shows (Kid Nation and
&gt; Life) as the others just seem &quot;lame&quot; to me!

Well, Fox has to be careful where they put things because a lot of
shows have or will be going on a brief hiatus during the baseball
playoffs.  My feeling is that this was not the best time for them to
launch this sort of series with their schedule in such flux and with
the new season of Dancing With the Stars.  Stars is two nights a week
and there are a bunch of new shows on, as well.  To make this the last
of the new shows of the season was not terribly smart.  People have
already decided what they are and aren't going to spend their time
watching.  My feeling is that Fox should have given an early start to
American Band, launching it as a late summer series where there was
enough time after the finale of Idol, maybe an early to mid-August
launch.  You get people hooked in when they have nothing else to watch
and you have them committed before the other series start.   Now you
have Fox putting the program on for two hour episodes (at least for
the first three weeks.)  When I saw that, it really made me re-think
whether I wanted to dive in at all.  If I don't fall on the floor in
love with the show after watching this past Friday's episode, I will
likely just punt it.

I just don't have the time or the patience to sit through that much
television and I've already chosen what I'm staying with this season
and dumping shows left and right to ease the burden.  I've already
dumped Chuck, Journeyman, Samantha Who, Cavemen, Big Shots, Moonlight,
Viva Laughlin and Tell Me You Love Me.  And there were several new
shows I didn't even bother to sample.  Right now, between broadcast
and cable, I'm committed to 11 hours of tv per week and I would
happily cut that down.  Thank god for Tivo, which automatically cuts a
third of that time out for me.

&gt;How are they going to do the voting? Right now I'm drawing a blank on how

The votes decide who the bottom 3 were, then they performed a song (in
season one, INXS assigned an INXS song to them to perform, in season
two, they mostly got to choose their own song to sing, except when one
of them got unlucky, oops, I guess it was supposed to be *lucky*
enough to perform one of Supernova's new songs). Then the band would
decided who would go home.

&gt; Switching to Pockstar, I saw a bulletin from Storm

As much as I didn't really care for Lukas, I didn't think any of the
contestants were bad enough to have to front for Supernova, the
stupidist name for a band. I mean, a supernova is what happens when a
star collapses in on itself. What a metaphor! Why would you name your
bad that?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I just hope they bring back that show. The problem is, they
&gt;need a serious band who needs a singer.
">

I do too, but I'm sure it's tough to find a band. They need a band
that:

1) is interested in reuniting with old bandmates
2) is interested in doing a game show
3) has big enough star power for voters to care about a big comeback
4) has a songbook big enough to support many weeks of a show.

People have mentioned Van Halen, but I'm not sure anyone cares
anymore. INXS was a perfect choice, because they were a band with a
tragic loss, good songs, a band that seemed to have potential. Nirvana
isn't an option because the surviving menbers have moved on, but even
if they wanted to reunite, man, we've heard more Nirvana songs over
the past two seasons of Rockstar than most people have heard in their
lifetime.

&gt; No idea what this is going to mean for the show.  They may just let it
&gt; play out to the finish due to the impending writers strike and to make
&gt; nice with Nigel Lythgoe
">

Even without the writer's strike, I seriously doubt, as a media insider,
that Fox would anger the Brits by cancelling the show.  They should hold
them in the same regard as Speilberg and you saw how they treated that
piece of crap he was associated with over the summer.  They'd, IMHO,
would have shown a black screen for an hour before they cancelled it.

I'm suspecting if Fuller and Co make a call, that Band would get moved
to a better timeslot for a few weeks as a tryout.  However, they should
have insisted on that first.  Now, unless they rerun last night very
quickly, it would be difficult to drum up an audience.

I'm not too sure Fox is happy to have baseball as well.  There's been
rumors that if the World Series ends up Colorado vs. Cleveland that a
few games might get shifted to alternative Fox cable stations or even
offered to TBS/TNT.  Now, MLB may well have a contract prohibition about
that but given how baseball ratings have declined over the years, I
seriously doubt that the next contract with the networks won't include
an out clause for them, if the matchups aren't to their liking.

Bingo, they should have launched it just like AI1.

&gt; &gt;Yes, and that's two hours of my life I'll
&gt; &gt; never get back. I liked maybe four
&gt; &gt; groups that got through. The funny thing
&gt; &gt; is that the *only* reason I watched it
&gt; &gt; was because I thought all of you guys
&gt; &gt; would be talking about it here!

&gt; Well, Holy-Moley...am I the ONLY one that actually LIKED this show
&gt; tonight?! My 30+ year old daughter and I watched it together and we both
&gt; really liked it! First it's a BIG plus to finally have something to
&gt; watch on Friday nights!  Did feel sorry for them out  in the triple
&gt; digit temps auditioning...strange place to pick in the summer?!

&gt; I didn't record it, so couldn't go back and watch/listen to some of the
&gt; particulars, so did it say they chose 60 bands to audition for them,
&gt; from tapes that were submitted? Then....they choose 12, and next week
&gt; the voting will begin? At least they didn't put us through a bunch of
&gt; &quot;crap-shoot&quot; auditions, like they did the last season of A.I.!  :-(

&gt; I thought the fellow from the Goo Goo Dolls was a good judge...reminds
&gt; me a lot of Dave Nivara, when he was judging Rock Star and I think
&gt; Sheila E was a good judge too, and other fellow wasn't too bad either,
&gt; but he was the one that swung the axe the most. I liked the host...love
&gt; his accent!

&gt; My favorite  band was Dot Dot Dot. but also like the &quot;edgy country&quot;
&gt; Nashville band (Six Wire) and I thought Denver &amp; The Mile High Band was
&gt; very good, and also the one with the Blue Grass sound (Cliff Wagoner and
&gt; Old Number 7) and  thought the lead singer in the black band (Franklin
&gt; Bridge) was GREAT.  The group of 12 year olds (Light Of Doom?) and
&gt; Rocket (all-gal's band) show potential.

&gt; Anyway....I'm very much looking forward to seeing these bands next
&gt; Friday night, and hearing more of what they have to offer!

Judy -- I didn't hate it; I just felt the same way about it that I do
about AI audiitions. Actually, I thought it was better than AI
auditions :-) I also missed Friday Night Lights (which is being Tivoed
at home so it's okay) and Women's Murder Club, which I think was the
pilot and I kind of wanted to see. I liked Dot Dot Dot, Six Wire, and
The Muggs. I actually enjoyed almost all of the bluegrass/country
performers and few if any rockers. I thought the 12-year-olds were
great and enjoyed Denver &amp; the Mile High Band.
