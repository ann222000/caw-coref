Christopher Hitchens

GOD IS NOT GREAT

The Case Against Religion
__________________________________________________________________

__________________________________________________________________

As its title indicates, this book is cast in the mould of Richard
Dawkins's [7]The God Delusion but is if anything even more
uncompromising. Thus, after an introductory chapter explaining why he
chose to write the book, Hitchens gives his second chapter the title
&quot;Religion Kills&quot;. This sets the tone for much of what follows.

The book is an attack on religion in general, which is probably why it
includes a short (and inadequate) chapter on Hinduism and Buddhism;
given that Buddhism is unconcerned with a God, this might have been
better omitted. In any case, the main focus, as one would expect, is
on the Abrahamic faiths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Hitchens, in
fact, equates religion with theism.

However, this book is not the place to come for a reasoned discussion
of the claims of theism. Hitchens is mainly concerned not so much to
counter the claims of religion philosophically as to demonstrate that
its effects are inherently bad. We get one short chapter on the
metaphysical shortcomings of religion and another on the failure of
arguments from design, but the rest of the book is really polemics.

Hitchens's position, stated at the outset, is that religion poisons
everything [his italics]. By this he means that &quot;people of faith are in
their different ways planning your and my destruction.&quot; He supports his
views with plenty of chapter and verse taken from the Old and New
Testaments and the Koran; there are also numerous references to
contemporary events. The writing is chatty and journalistic, but for
some reason I found the book quite hard to focus on; perhaps this style
is more suited to a Sunday newspaper than to book length.

This is one of several forceful attacks on religion (by Richard
Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel C. Dennett) to have appeared in recent
years. Although they attract a lot of attention and seem to be widely
read, I wonder how much effect they really have. As Michael Shermer has
remarked in a recent article in Scientific American (19 August 2007),
&quot;anti&quot; movements by themselves are not enough; something positive is
needed as well. And, as Martin Rees, the President of the Royal Society
has said, it will be better to seek allies among religious moderates
than to attack all religious views indiscriminately.

They do believe in all kinds of strange things. I guess reality
isn't for everyone.

Hitchens is right. Religions have their faults despite being concerned
with an Abrahamic God. Some Buddhist sects will kill members of other
Buddhist sects for not having the right religion.

I doubt that is what he means. It isn't faith that poisons religion,
it's the  dogma that poisons religion.

One minor nitpick, Dave. 'Atheism' shouldn't be capitalized unless
it's the first word in the sentence. It isn't the &quot;proper&quot; name of a
formal belief system, but merely a descriptive term for a *lack* of
belief.

I'd like to have a citation for that one...

Then don't capitalize it. Your choice..... whine about others
doing it, or get a life.
