Digital Penetration  Invasion of the naked body scanners.By William Saletan
Posted Saturday, March 3, 2007, at 7:32 AM ET

Psssst. Want to see Susan Hallowell naked? Look at the Feb. 24 New York Times. She's on Page A10.

Hallowell runs the Transportation Security Administration's research lab. Four years ago, she volunteered to be scanned by a backscatter X-ray machine, which sees through clothing. She was wearing a skirt and blazer. But in the picture, she's as good as nude.
Now it's your turn.

Last week, TSA began using backscatters at airports to screen passengers for weapons. The first machine is up and running in Phoenix. The next ones will be in New York and Los Angeles. The machines have been modified with a "privacy algorithm" to clean up what they show. But even the tempered images tell you more than you need to know about the endowments of the people seated next to you.

Are you up for this? Are you ready to get naked for your country?

This is no joke. The government needs to look under your clothes. Ceramic knives, plastic guns, and liquid explosives have made metal detectors obsolete. Carry-on bags are X-rayed, so the safest place to hide a weapon is on your body. Puffer machines can detect explosives on you, but only if you're sloppy. Backscatters are different. They can scan your whole surface, locating and identifying anything of unusual density—not just metals, which have high atomic numbers, but drugs and explosives, which have low ones.

Why isn't this technology in lots of airports already? One reason is fear of radiation. That's a needless worry. You get less radiation from a scan than from sitting on a plane for two minutes. If that's too much for you, don't fly.

The main stumbling block has been privacy. The ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have fought backscatters at every turn, calling them a "virtual strip search." It's a curious phrase. The purpose of a strip-search is the search. Stripping is just a means. Virtual inspections achieve the same end by other means. They don't extend the practice of strip-searching. They abolish it.

When the manufacturer of the backscatter machines, American Science &amp; Engineering, introduced the technology in prisons nine years ago, the whole point was to replace strip searches. "The scan requires no physical contact between the operator and the subject, thus vastly reducing the threat of assault against law enforcement personnel and the spread of communicable diseases," the company argued. The rationale, like the machine, conveyed not an ounce of human warmth, which is why the inmates preferred it. Better to be seen than touched. Better to be depersonalized than degraded.
Thanks to terrorism, the rest of us now face the same choice. Under TSA policy, if you set off an airport metal detector or are chosen for secondary screening, you're subject to a pat-down inspection that "may include sensitive areas of the body" such as your chest and thighs. Unless, that is, you're lucky enough to be in Phoenix, where you can choose a backscatter instead.

The impersonality of machines can also filter out racism. Five years ago, the ACLU objected to body scans because they were administered selectively, "based on profiles that are racially discriminatory." But the best way to remove selection bias is to scan everyone. In Phoenix, TSA has put the backscatter monitors in a sealed room 50 feet from the security checkpoint, so the officers who staff them can't see you. All they can see are X-ray images, which capture density, not pigment. To them, everyone is the same color.

Putting a machine interface between you and the examining officer protects your visual as well as tactile privacy. In a strip search, the officer sees you exactly as you are. On a monitor, the image can be filtered. The "privacy algorithm" doesn't obscure every detail of your physique, as pictures on TSA's Web site make all too clear. But that's not essential. Look closely at the pictures. It's not the body that has been rendered indistinct. It's the face.
That's the first key to reconciling airport screening with privacy: We need to see your body, not your face. For those 30 seconds, we know where you are. If your scan suggests a problem, we'll pull you aside. The second key is that the officer who sees you on the monitor never sees you in the flesh. In Phoenix, TSA hasn't just put the monitors in a separate room. It's laying cables to put them in an entirely different terminal. Likewise, the officer who sees you in the flesh never sees you on the monitor. It's like the blind men and the elephant: Nobody has the whole picture.

Which brings us back to Susan Hallowell. The Times twice avoided naming the naked woman in its Feb. 24 photo. It did, however, mention that the machines were made by AS&amp;E. On AS&amp;E's Web site, I found a press release complaining that pictures circulating in the press were obsolete because they'd been taken in 2003. Then I ran across a 2004 article that said Hallowell had demonstrated the technology the previous year. I typed her name into a search engine and up came a 2003 wire story with a photo of her, fully clothed, next to a monitor showing the same image that appeared in the Times. I didn't need to read a word. You could tell she was the same woman just by looking at her face.

Hallowell volunteered for this notoriety. But what happened to her mustn't happen to others. In the age of body scans, privacy means keeping your name, your face, and your nude image apart. That job doesn't end at the security gate; it begins there. Will your scan leak? "Images will not be printed, stored or transmitted," TSA swears on its Web site. Directly above that assurance, the agency has posted four nude pictures—"actual images shown to the Transportation Security Officer during the backscatter process." And you thought airport screeners had no sense of humor.

Enough with the fairy tales. We lost our innocence when the planes hit the towers. Now we're losing our modesty. If we're going to be ogled, at least protect us from being Googled.

A version of this article also appears in the Outlook section of the Sunday Washington Post.

In tribal Pakistan, a shave may cost your life   By Mushtaq Yusufzai, NBC News Producer in Bajaur and Carol Grisanti, NBC News Producer in Islamabad

In the tribal areas of Pakistan, a shave may cost your life.

"The government is unable to protect us so we will abide by what the Taliban tells us to do and stop shaving beards," said Niamat, a barber in Khar, the headquarters of the Bajaur tribal agency along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
And the Taliban mean business, On Sunday night, bombs destroyed two barber shops and three others suffered partial damage after the owners refused to follow the orders.
"I am a Muslim and I know that no one can force me to shave or not to shave. This should be my decision," said Nasir, a regular customer, wearing a green turtleneck sweater and jeans. "But I was threatened. They asked if I will obey the new laws; I will obey because I am afraid."

A couple of weeks earlier, in the middle of the night, someone slipped leaflets under barbershop doors throughout the Bajaur Tribal Agency. The warning was hand-written in Pashto, the language of the Pashtun tribes who inhabit the border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The leaflets read: "SHAVING BEARDS AND TRIMMING BEARDS IS UN-ISLAMIC AND IS FORBIDDEN. VIOLATORS WILL BE KILLED."

The customers panicked and the barbers panicked too. In almost every barber shop the owners put up signs begging their customers not to force them to give a shave.
Slow 'Talibanization' of tribal areas

A shave costs less than 2 cents -- but the Taliban edict forbidding barbers to shave or even trim beards will cause severe economic hardship, and put many of the 200 barbers in Bajaur out of business.
"Barbers are poor people, they have no other business," said Ikram, another regular customer. "If they can’t give shaves, they will not be able to feed their children."
A group of barbers told NBC News that their business had declined by 70 percent since the Taliban issued the edict.
But that’s not all.
This latest threat by local Taliban militants comes on the heels of an announced ban on music -- music that is sold in CD shops or even played in somebody’s car. If the Taliban are to be believed, this is one more sin against Islam and a crime punishable by death. It’s one more alarming sign of the so-called Talibanization of Pakistan’s tribal areas.
Tribal area a sanctuary for Taliban
Bajaur is the smallest and perhaps the most inaccessible of Pakistan’s seven Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The tribal areas or agencies, as they are called, are semi-autonomous and have always been just outside the laws of the government of Pakistan. This is a holdover from the British Raj; the empire that separated British-run India from Afghanistan before Pakistan was created.
The colonial British decided it was better to allow the fiercely independent Pashtun tribes that inhabit the tribal areas to run their own affairs, according to their own tribal customs and laws. And the Pakistanis continued this arrangement.
But it is this tribal culture and this "laissez-faire" policy of successive Pakistani governments that has nurtured sympathy for the Taliban and allowed these isolated border areas to become sanctuaries for the Taliban and al-Qaida militants.
It is rumored that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the number two man in al-Qaida, comes and goes as he pleases in Banjaur. In fact up until 2005, when the Pakistanis raided it, al-Qaida had its winter headquarters in Bajaur, inside the high-walled mud compound of a local cleric about eight miles from the Afghan border.
Fear of the consequences
Meantime, a few customers are still demanding a shave.
"I am clean-shaven and I will remain so," said Ikram, from behind the long wooly beige scarf covering his face." He insisted the scarf protected him from the bitter cold weather and not from the Taliban threat. "All the barbers refuse to shave me now, so I do it myself at home," he said.
One of Ikram’s like-minded friends even broke down the store-front glass window of a barber shop recently, and then threatened to break all the mirrors inside, when the barber, a man named Zareenullah, refused to even trim his small neat chin beard. But Zareenullah wouldn't budge.
"If we don’t follow they will kill us," said Zareenullah, "What can we do?"
"I offer to give them haircuts," he said. "Haircuts are allowed."
