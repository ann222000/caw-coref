Daily Reflections

IDENTIFYING FEAR . . . .

The chief activator of our defects has been self -
centered fear. . . . .
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 76

When I feel uncomfortable, irritated, or depressed, I
look for fear. This &quot;evil and corroding thread&quot; is the
root of my distress: Fear of failure; fear of other's
opinions; fear of harm, and many other fears. I have
found a Higher Power who does not want me to live in
fear and, as a result, the experience of A.A. in my
life is freedom and joy. I am no longer willing to live
with the multitude of character defects that
characterized my life while I was drinking. Step Seven
is my vehicle to freedom from these defects. I pray for
help in identifying the fear underneath the defect, and
then I ask God to relieve me of that fear. This method
works for me without fail and is one of the great
miracles of my life in Alcoholics Anonymous.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

We tried to study our alcoholic problem, wondering what
was the cause of our strange obsession. Many of us took
special treatments, hospitalization, even confinement in
institutions. In every case, the relief was only temporary.
We tried through crazy excuses to convince ourselves that
we knew why we drank, but we went on regardless. Finally
drinking had gone far beyond even a habit. We had become
alcoholics, men and women who had been destroying
themselves against their own will. Am I completely free
from my alcoholic obsession?

Meditation For The Day

&quot;Ask and ye shall receive.&quot; Never let yourself think you
cannot do something useful or that you never will be able
to accomplish a useful task. The fact is that you can do
practically anything in the field of human relationships,
if you are willing to call on God's supply of strength. The
supply may not be immediately available, because you may
not be entirely ready to receive it. But it will surely come
when you are properly prepared for it. As you grow spiritually,
a feeling of being plentifully supplied by God's strength will
possess you and you will be able to accomplish many useful
things.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that I may claim God's supply of strength by my faith
in Him. I pray that it shall be given to me according to my faith.

***********************************************************

As Bill Sees It

&quot;Admitted to God . . .&quot;, p. 126

Provided you hold back nothing in taking the Fifth Step, your sense of
relief will mount from minute to minute. The dammed-up emotions of
years break out of their confinement, and miraculously vanish as soon
as they are exposed. As the pain subsides, a healing tranquillity takes
its place. And when humility and serenity are so combined, something
else of great moment is apt to occur.

Many an A.A., once agnostic or atheist, tells us that it was during this
stage of Step Five that he first actually felt the presence of God.
And even those who already had faith often become conscious of God
as they never were before.

Walk In Dry Places

*Should we Intervene?
Recovery
The method of conducting interventions is considered an effective way of
confronting alcoholics and drug addicts.  Interventions are done with
the hope that this confrontation will &quot;raise the bottom,&quot; and that the
addict will face the condition before there's further anguish.
However effective interventions may be, they're not part of the 12 Step
program. Our work is based on attraction, not the admitted coercion
that's part of intervention.
If we take part in interventions, this separation should be clearly
understood.  The person who still suffers should know that the 12 Step
program depends on attraction, not any of the other methods that might
be available.
It's important to make this point clear, because the intervention may
fail. Whether it does or not, the individual must not be left with the
idea that intervention is a 12 Step activity. At any stage, the
fellowship is always available to him or her.
I'll probably see lots of people today who need help in facing their
addiction. I'll know that their recovery comes in God's good time. ***

*Keep It Simple

** When fate hands us a lemon, let's try to make lemonade.---Dale Carnegie
Our illness is one big lemon, but our recovery is lemonade. None of us
signed up to be drunks or drugies, but we all signed up for recovery.
That's when the happiness began. Yes, there will be pain, but the joy
will far outweigh the pain. The sweet joy of recovery becomes our
drink---our lemonade. And, do we drink!
We have new friends. We love ourselves, our Higher Power, our family,
and much more. We are creative when we give joy, love and help to others
and to ourselves. If your lemonade isn't sweet enough, add more of your
program.
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, it's easy to forget how much You've
given me. Thank you for all the joy and love You have given me.
Action for the Day:  Today, I'll write down what part of recovery I
really enjoy. I will then share this list with my group or friend.**

**Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

*WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY - This young alcoholic stepped out a second-story
window and into A.A.
*

*Looking back, that may have been the first healthy decision I ever made
with respect to alcohol.  One definition of a bottom is the point when
the last thing you lost or the next thing you are about to lose is more
important to you than booze.  That point is different for everyone, and
some of us die before we get there.  For me, though, it was clear.  I
was willing to do anything to get back into school.*

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Tradition One - &quot;Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
depends upon A.A. Unity.&quot;

Those who look closely soon have the key to this strange paradox. The
A.A. member has to conform to the principles of recovery. His life
actually depends upon obedience to spiritual principles. If he deviates
too far, the penalty is sure and swift; he sickens and dies. At first he
goes along because he must, but later he discovers a way of life he
really wants to live. Moreover, he finds he cannot keep this priceless
gift unless he gives it away. Neither he nor anybody else can survive
unless he carries the A.A. message. The moment this Twelfth Step work
forms a group, another discovery is made - that most individuals cannot
recover unless there is a group. Realization dawns that he is but a
small part of a great whole; that no personal sacrifice is too great for
preservation of the Fellowship. He learns that the clamor of desires and
ambitions within him must be silenced whenever these could damage the
group. It becomes plain that the group must survive or the individual
will not.

Love yourself and all your emotions.
Be as honest with yourself as you can be.
Say how you really feel.
--Melody Beattie

&quot;And now here is my secret, a very simple secret; it is only with the
heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot;

--Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Though we travel the world to find the beautiful, we must carry it
within us or we will find it not.
--Ralph Waldo Emerson

God, help me to lower my defenses today, to be open to the good in
the people around me and to the good that I have to offer them.
--Melody Beattie

&quot;Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.&quot;
--John Wooden

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

POWER

&quot;The measure of man is what he
does with power.&quot;
--Pittacus

With my recovery has come a certain success, and with the success
comes power. Power comes with the spiritual program, but it must be
exercised responsibly. Just as the disease used alcohol to destroy my
life, so it can use power to destroy me in sobriety. Power is a
doubled-edged sword that has led many back to drinking. Certainly an
abuse of power is not consistent with sobriety.

Today I am respectful of power because I know it can lead to an
inflated ego or an arrogant personality that continues to destroy the
quality of life. Today I surround myself with friends who will remind
me of my roots.

Teach me not to use my White Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage to
belittle or patronize those from minority groups.

Teach me to exercise power responsibly.

***********************************************************

Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is
right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if
anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. Whatever
you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it
into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice greatly
in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed,
you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not
saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content
whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know
what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in
any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in
plenty or in want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
Phillipians 4:8-13

Daily Inspiration

Make few promises and keep the ones you make. Lord, grant me the
strength to keep my commitments, especially the ones that I make to myself.

Life is what our thinking makes it. Lord, help me visualize myself
richly living each day, believing, achieving, and then succeeding.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
* Knock and it shall be opened unto you. *
