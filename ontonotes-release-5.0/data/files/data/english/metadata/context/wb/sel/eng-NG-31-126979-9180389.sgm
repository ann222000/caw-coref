High to low to high impedance with 2 direct boxes?

Can I plug keyboard outputs into two direct boxes to give them a low
impedance signal, run them back to the board thru a snake, and then
plug them into direct boxes to convert back to high impedance, and
then run into a board channel?  I would like to do this so that I can
use one of the stereo inputs of my Mackie Onyx 1620 (8 channels with
pre-amps, 8 without) for keyboard (and maybe another for electronic
drums) without using up valuable pre-amps.

I have heard that some folks in the studio plug a guitar's patch cable
into a direct box, run XLR cable a long ways to another room where it
plugs into a direct box and then sends a patch cable out of the direct
box into the amp input.  So I am guessing my idea would work the same
way, but I don't know.  But, gosh, it would be a lot of direct boxes.

Thanks,
Nat

most direct boxes have 1/4 paralleled in/outs on one end and the xlr out
on the other
this allows for what you want with just one di
plug your keys into the 1/4 in take a 1/4 to 1/4 cord to the other 1/4
jack(on the di) and run it to any line level input you desire
and hook the xlr to the snake running to Foh.

Most likely a simple adaptor or adaptor cable at the mixer end will suffice.

Might I suggest a submixer on stage for the keys which would reduce the
feeds to one pair?

I have done this, and it works as long as you use passive DIs.

That said, I don't think you will need the DIs at the mixer end of the
snake, just XLR-F to TRS adapter cables. Mackie says that the Onyx
line inputs are balanced, and have up to 40dB of gain.

Try it out with a pair of passive DIs and a pair of adapter cables.
Most keyboards have plenty of output, should work OK.

It will be awhile before I can set it all up again.  But I sure will

I would rather keep the electronic drums and keyboard separate, even
if that means running four separate signals back up the snake.
(Although I could live with the keyboard mixed into mono and just send
three cables back to the board.)

dont feel bad we have others(who claimed to be highly qualified and

its where you mix the main(audience) speakers from

I had the impression there were 2 or more keyboards. Personally I have been
using a Prosonus preamp as it has worked well with the unbalanced stereo
headphone output of a Casio. I intend to try a Behringer DI120 soon.

I did have a problem with a Rolls 4-ch active DI and keyboard.   Some sort
of ground loop buzz that the ground lift switched didn't help. The Keyboard
used a wall wart, no ground pin type supply.

Front Of House, where the audience is and where the mixing desk should be.

We did have one idiot who tried to tell us it was the back of the stage (and
that was after several years off posting here during which he still didn't
figure it out yet still claimed he was an experienced sound engineer) but
people still ridicule him for it (plus all the other hysterical errors he
makes pretty much every time he posts). He's laying low at the moment after
having made a complete fool of himself all over again a couple of days ago.

Are keyboard aux outs always low impedance?  I guess, though, that my
question was bad... what I really need is to balance that signal, low
impedance or not, so I can run it up the snake, eh?

** Wrong again.

You just need cable adaptors to go from unbalanced jack to XLR and back
again.

According to the online manual the stereo inputs are 1/4&quot; balanced, so why
do you want to use a DI box?  Just use a female XLR to 1/4&quot; balanced patch
cord to connect the snake to the board.
