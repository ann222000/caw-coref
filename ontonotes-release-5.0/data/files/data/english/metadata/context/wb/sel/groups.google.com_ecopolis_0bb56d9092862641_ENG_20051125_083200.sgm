Getting close to nature is good for you
===============================
Editorial: Human health and nature conservation BMJ Volume 331, pp
1221-2

Connecting with nature can improve your health and wellbeing, say
researchers in this week's BMJ. The theory is known as ecotherapy:
restoring health through contact with nature.

Use of wildlife in some therapies is reported to improve quality of
life, write the authors. Smaller animals (for example, squirrels, owls,
and raccoons) have been used successfully in therapies for children
with emotional and behavioural problems.

People who take part in conservation projects report subjective health
benefits, ascribed to being outdoors and to feeling part of a greater
system connecting beyond the individual. Such projects can help
overcome social isolation, develop skills, and improve employment
prospects, as well as provide the known benefits associated with
exercise.

Although initial research has been promising, the UK needs robust
health impact assessments of wildlife projects to determine their
objective therapeutic value, say the authors.

English Nature has advocated a national strategy to encourage people to
reconnect with nature and benefit from proximity to wildlife.

Partnerships between healthcare providers and nature organisations to
share and exchange expertise could create new policies that recognise
the interdependence between healthy people and healthy ecosystems, they
conclude
