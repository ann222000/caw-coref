Cow's Milk is the &quot;Perfect Food&quot; for Baby Calves
But Many Doctors Agree it is Not Healthy for Humans
by Michael Dye

http://members.tripod.com/~josquin/milk.htm
People who have been taught that cow's milk is the &quot;perfect food&quot; may
be shocked to hear many prominent medical doctors are now saying dairy
consumption is a contributing factor in nearly two dozen diseases of
children and adults.

Doctors say cow's milk can lead to iron deficiency anemia, allergies,
diarrhea, heart disease, colic, cramps, gastrointestinal bleeding,
sinusitis, skin rashes, acne, increased frequency of colds and flus,
arthritis, diabetes, ear infections, osteoporosis, asthma, autoimmune
diseases, and more, possibly even lung cancer, multiple sclerosis and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In American society, one of the most sacred of all sacred cows is the
milk of the cow itself. Cow's milk is more American than apple pie,
but that's because apple pie doesn't have Congressional lobbyists and
a multi-million dollar advertising budget. Most parents wouldn't think
of raising their children without the benefit of cow's milk to help
their little bones to grow big and strong. Its silky, white texture is
the very epitome of our concept of wholesome purity.

Our &quot;nutritional education&quot; in school (funded in part by the dairy
industry) taught us that dairy products are one of the four basic food
groups we all need for proper nutrition. And with more than 60 of the
most powerful Congressional leaders in Washington receiving campaign
contributions from the National Dairy Council, we can be assured that
dairy products are well-entrenched as a major staple of our
government-sponsored school lunch programs.

Cow's milk is promoted as the &quot;perfect food&quot; for humans, and
especially for our children. This advertising has put such a strong
emphasis on the health of our children that some people view milk
commercials as more of a public service announcement than an attempt
to sell a product. These ads have told us &quot;Milk is a Natural,&quot;
&quot;Everybody Needs Milk,&quot; &quot;Milk is the Perfect Food,&quot; etc. This
advertising has served its purpose well because the average American
consumes 375 pounds of dairy products a year. One out of every seven
dollars spent on groceries in the U.S. goes to buy dairy products.

But to gauge the full impact of this promotion, we must consider more
than just the dollar amount spent on dairy products. We must also
consider the impact this massive advertising, promotion, lobbying,
&quot;nutritional education&quot; and public relations effort has had by
creating a widely-held perception of cow's milk as a very wholesome
and healthy product. This promotion has been so effective that it is
common for even people who give up meat to still feel that they should
continue consuming dairy products to ensure they receive sufficient
protein or calcium. People buy cow's milk for their families based on
the premise that this product provides essential nutrition, helps to
build a healthy body, and that indeed, their precious health may be in
jeopardy if they do not drink milk. If this is the premise on which
Americans spend an incredible chunk of their grocery bill to provide
for the health and nutrition of their loved ones, we need to further
examine this premise. Despite what the dairy industry has led us to
believe, many medical doctors and nutritionists are now saying that
cow's milk is not healthy for human consumption, and that it can lead
to many serious diseases. When you look at the credentials of the
doctors making these statements, it would be hard for the dairy
industry to accuse these physicians of being on the lunatic fringe of
the medical world.

Frank Oski, M.D., author of Don't Drink Your Milk! is the Director of
the Department of Pediatrics of Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine and Physician-in-Chief of the Johns Hopkins Children's
Center. He is the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of 19 medical
textbooks and has written 290 medical manuscripts.

In the first chapter of his book, Dr. Oski states, &quot;The fact is: the
drinking of cow milk has been linked to iron-deficiency anemia in
infants and children; it has been named as the cause of cramps and
diarrhea in much of the world's population, and the cause of multiple
forms of allergy as well; and the possibility has been raised that it
may play a central role in the origins of atherosclerosis and heart
attacks.&quot; Dr. Oski comments, &quot;Being against cow milk is equated with
being un-American,&quot; but still he notes, &quot;Among physicians, so much
concern has been voiced about the potential hazards of cow milk that
the Committee on Nutrition of the prestigious American Academy of
Pediatrics, the institutional voice of practicing pediatricians,
released a report entitled, 'Should Milk Drinking by Children Be
Discouraged?' Although the Academy's answer to this question has (as
of this writing) been a qualified 'maybe,' the fact that the question
was raised at all is testimony to the growing concern about this
product, which for so long was viewed as sacred as the proverbial
goodness of mother and apple pie.&quot;

Another outspoken critic of cow's milk is Dr. William Ellis, a retired
osteopathic physician and surgeon in Arlington, Texas, who has
researched the effects of dairy products for 42 years. Dr. Ellis is
listed in Marquis' Who's Who in the East, Leaders of American Science,
the Dictionary of International Biography and Two Thousand Men of
Achievement. Dr. Ellis says dairy products are &quot;simply no good for
humans... There is overwhelming evidence that milk and milk products
are harmful to many people, both adults and infants. Milk is a
contributing factor in constipation, chronic fatigue, arthritis,
headaches, muscle cramps, obesity, allergies and heart problems.&quot; When
Washington D.C.-based pediatrician Dr. Russell Bunai was asked what
single change in the American diet would produce the greatest health
benefit, his answer was, &quot;Eliminating dairy products.&quot; Dr. Christiane
Northrup, a gynecologist in Yarmouth, Maine, states, &quot;Dairy is a
tremendous mucus producer and a burden on the respiratory, digestive
and immune systems.&quot; Dr. Northrup says when patients &quot;eliminate dairy
products for an extended period and eat a balanced diet, they suffer
less from colds and sinus infections.&quot;

Dr. Oski's book includes a letter written by Dr. J. Dan Baggett, a
pediatrician in Alabama who describes his experience after six years
of recommending that all his patients eliminate cow's milk from their
diets. He writes, &quot;In general, they cooperate much better than I had
earlier anticipated except for the pre-teenagers and teenagers.&quot; Dr.
Baggett's letter, states in part:

&quot;During the years 1963 through 1967, I referred an average of four
appendectomy cases per year. During the past five and a half years, I
have referred only two patients for appendectomy, the last one being
three years ago. Both of these children were professed milk guzzlers.
&quot;I do not have a single patient with active asthma. In fact, I have
nearly forgotten how to prescribe for them.

&quot;Perhaps the most significant thing I have learned is that Group A
beta-hemolytic streptococcus germ will not, under ordinary
circumstances, establish an infection in a child kept on an absolutely
no-milk-protein dietary regimen. I have been aware of this for the
past two and a half years and, so far, there have been no exceptions.
Any time a patient of mine is found to have streptococcal pharyngitis
or pyoderma, we can establish by history that he has ingested milk
protein within five days prior to onset of symptoms or signs bringing
him to the office. &quot;I now admit an average of 12-14 patients per year
to the hospital. Their average hospital stay is three days. Between
1963 and 1967, I admitted an average of 100+ patients to the hospital
per year. Their average stay was five days.&quot;

So how can all these medical statements be explained in light of what
we have been taught all of our life about milk? Remember &quot;Milk is the
Perfect Food&quot;... &quot;Milk is a Natural&quot;... &quot;Everybody Needs Milk.&quot; Are we
talking about the same food here? Perhaps we are not. It would appear
that promoters of cow's milk are creating advertising statements that
are meant to appeal on a subconscious level to our positive feelings
and experiences with human breast milk. All mammals, including humans,
are intended to be nourished during infancy by milk from their mother.
Part of the very definition of a mammal is that the female of the
species has milk-producing glands in her breasts which provide
nourishment for her young. Each species of mammal produces its unique
type of milk designed specifically to strengthen the immune system and
provide nourishment for their babies, which are weaned after their
birth weight has approximately tripled.

So, absolutely yes, &quot;milk is a natural&quot;... in the proper context. It
is perfectly natural for infant mammals, including humans, to be
nourished exclusively by milk from their mother's breasts. So if we
are talking about human breast milk for babies, yes, &quot;milk is the
perfect food.&quot; And yes, during infancy when we have no teeth for
eating solid food, and as we need to strengthen our immune system,
&quot;everybody needs milk.&quot; I have just quoted three of the most popular
advertising slogans of the dairy industry and they are undisputably as
true as any words that could be spoken on the subject of nutrition...
if they are applied to a baby's need for human breast milk. In fact,
not one of the doctors I have quoted in describing the terrible
problems caused by cow's milk would disagree that milk is a natural,
milk is the perfect food or that everybody needs milk, in this
context. But whoa. The dairy industry has begun with these three
statements that we all know are true about a baby's need for human
breast milk, and twisted them out of context to apply them to a
completely different product they are selling. And the sad result is
that most Americans still think these noble statements about our
babies needing to suckle their mother's breast milk are true when
applied to the advertising claim that humans of all ages need to buy
and drink cow's milk. So, in an effort to undo the damage caused by
this manipulation, let us consider the differences in human breast
milk versus cow's milk, and further examine the physical problems
caused by humans trying to subsist on the milk of another species well
past the age when any mammal should be drinking any milk.

A good place to start in analyzing the distinction between milk of
different species is to begin to understand how nature works. As Dr.
Oski explains in Don't Drink Your Milk!, &quot;The milk of each species
appears to have been specifically designed to protect the young of
that species. Cross-feeding does not work. Heating, sterilization, or
modification of the milk in any way destroys the protection.&quot; So, how
much of a difference is there between a human baby drinking the milk
of its mother versus drinking the milk of a cow? Dr. Oski cites a
&quot;study of over twenty thousand infants conducted in Chicago as far
back as the 1930s... The overall death rate for the babies raised on
human milk was 1.5 deaths per 1,000 infants while the death rate in
the babies fed cow milk was 84.7 per 1,000 during the first nine
months of life. The death rate from gastrointestinal infections was
forty times higher in the non-breast-fed infants, while the death rate
from respiratory infections was 120 times higher. An earlier analysis
involving infants in eight American cities showed similar results.
Infants fed on cow milk had a twenty times greater chance of dying
during the first six months of life.&quot;

Dr. Michael Taylor, a Chiropractic Physician, doctoral candidate to
become a Doctor of Nutrition and fellow of the American Academy of
Orthomolecular Medicine, agrees, stating, &quot;It is a dietary error to
cross species to get milk from another animal.&quot; He notes there is a
tremendous difference between human babies and baby calves, and a
corresponding difference between the milk that is intended to nourish
human babies and baby calves. In an interview on &quot;Let's Eat,&quot; a
Seventh-day Adventist television program, Dr. Taylor notes that human
infants take about 180 days to double their birth weight, and that
human milk is 5 to 7 percent protein. Calves require only 45 days to
double their birth weight and cow's milk is 15 percent protein. In
addition to the difference in the amount of protein in these two
different types of milk, there are also major differences in the
composition of this protein. The primary type of protein in cow's milk
is casein. Cow's milk has 20 times as much casein as human milk, which
makes the protein from cow's milk difficult or impossible for humans
to assimilate, according to Dr. John R. Christopher, N.D., M.H.
Protein composes 15 percent of the human body and when this protein
cannot be properly broken down, it weakens the immune system, causing
allergies and many other problems. Allergies caused by cow's milk are
extremely common. In fact, Dr. Taylor states that when a single food
can be isolated as the cause of an allergy, 60 percent of the time,
that food is cow's milk. Dr. Ellis notes that symptoms of this
allergic reaction to cow's milk in infants can include asthma, nasal
congestion, skin rash, chest infections, irritability and fatigue. Dr.
Oski's book cites evidence from Dr. Joyce Gryboski, director of the
Pediatric Gastrointestinal Clinic at Yale University School of
Medicine, who states &quot;they see at least one child a week who is
referred for evaluation of chronic diarrhea and proves to have nothing
more than an allergy to cow milk.&quot;

Another reason many people suffer various symptoms of disease from
drinking milk is that, according to Dr. Oski, the majority of the
world's adult population is &quot;lactose intolerant,&quot; meaning they cannot
digest lactose, the sugar in milk (cow's milk and human milk). An
enzyme known as lactase is required to digest lactose, and Dr. Oski
states that &quot;between the age of one and a half and four years most
individuals gradually lose the lactase activity in their small
intestine. This appears to be a normal process that accompanies
maturation.... Most people do it. All animals do it. It reflects the
fact that nature never intended lactose-containing foods, such as
milk, to be consumed after the normal weaning period.&quot;

In fact, so many people have bad reactions to drinking cow's milk that
in 1974 the Federal Trade Commission felt compelled to take legal
action against advertising claims made by the California Milk
Producers. The ads claimed &quot;Everybody Needs Milk.&quot; The FTC prosecuted
the milk producers for &quot;false, misleading and deceptive&quot; advertising.
The FTC complaint cited the high incidence of lactose intolerance,
allergies caused by cow's milk and the increased risk of heart
disease. The FTC won and the milk producers had to come up with a new
slogan for their ads: &quot;Milk Has Something for Everybody.&quot; One medical
researcher, Dr. Kevin McGrady, commented, &quot;Milk has something for
everybody all right -- higher blood cholesterol, and increased risk of
heart disease and stroke.&quot; Three reasons cited by medical researchers
that dairy products contribute to heart disease are their high content
of cholesterol and fat, along with an enzyme in cow's milk called
xanthine oxidase (XO). This enzyme, which creates problems only when
milk is homogenized, causes heart disease by damaging arteries.
Explaining the significance of XO, Dr. Ellis cites research by Dr.
Kurt Oster, Chief of Cardiology at Park City Hospital in Bridgeport,
Connecticut: &quot;From 1971 to 1974, we studied 75 patients with angina
pectoris (chest pain due to heart disease) and arteriosclerosis
(hardening of the arteries). All the patients were taken off milk and
given folic acid (a B-vitamin) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), both of
which combat the action of XO. The results were dramatic. Chest pains
decreased, symptoms lessened, and each of those patients is doing
great today.&quot; Dr. Oster's article states that Dr. Kurt Esselbacher,
Chairman of the Department of the Harvard Medical School, was in full

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
agreement. Dr. Esselbacher writes: &quot;Homogenized milk, because of its
">

XO content, is one of the major causes of heart disease in the U.S.&quot;

Dr. Oski warns, &quot;The consumption of cow milk from an early age may
have life-long consequences... One pathologist has reviewed the heart
vessels of over 1,500 children and adolescents who had died as a
result of accidents.... These children and adolescents had not died as
a result of disease, yet many of them showed signs of diseased
arteries in the heart.... The majority of children with normal blood
vessels had been breast-fed; the majority of children with diseased
vessels had been fed cow milk or cow milk based formulas. It is
therefore reasonable to conclude that the differences between human
milk and cow milk were responsible for the early changes in the
coronary arteries.&quot; But don't we need to drink milk to get calcium?
No. The best way to add calcium to your diet is to eat more fresh
green vegetables. Cow's milk is high in calcium, but Dr. Ellis
explains, the problem is that it is in a form that cannot be
assimilated very well by humans. Dr. Ellis states, &quot;Thousands and
thousands of blood tests I've conducted show that people who drink 3
or 4 glasses of milk a day invariably had the lowest levels of blood
calcium.&quot; Dr. Ellis adds, &quot;Low levels of blood calcium correspond with
irritability and headaches. In addition, the low calcium level in
milk-drinkers also explains why milk-drinkers are prone to have muscle
spasms and cramps. Since calcium is necessary for muscles to relax, a
lack of calcium causes muscle cramps, etc.&quot;

One of the most serious problems caused by a calcium deficiency is
osteoporosis, a condition characterized by the loss of 50 to 75
percent of the person's original bone material. In the U.S., 25
percent of 65-year-old women suffer from osteoporosis. Their bones
become brittle and easily broken. They can crack a rib from something
as minor as a sneeze. Our pervasive dairy advertising has led to one
of the most commonly held, and solidly disproved, fallacies about
bones, which is that the best way to build strong bones is to increase
calcium consumption by drinking plenty of milk. Actually, the
consensus among leading medical researchers is that the best way for
most people to increase their calcium level and strengthen their bones
is to reduce their protein intake, and specifically to reduce
consumption of animal products. Research has conclusively shown we can
do more to increase the calcium level in our bones by reducing protein
intake than by increasing calcium intake. The reason is that animal
products and other sources of high protein are very acidic, and the
blood stream must balance this acidic condition by absorbing alkaline
minerals such as calcium from the bone structure. Thus, numerous
studies, including those published in the Aug. 22, 1984 Medical
Tribune and the March 1983 Journal of Clinical Nutrition, have found
that vegetarians have much stronger bones than meat-eaters. Indeed,
the Journal of Clinical Nutrition article found that by age 65,
meat-eaters had five to six times as much measurable bone loss as
vegetarians.

Speaking of minerals, another serious problem caused by consumption of
cow's milk is iron-deficiency anemia. Dr. Oski notes that 15 to 20
percent of children under age 2 in the U.S. suffer from
iron-deficiency anemia. Cow's milk contributes to this condition in
two ways. First, he notes that cow's milk is extremely low in iron,
containing less than 1 milligram of iron per quart. Because of this,
he writes that it is estimated that a 1-year-old would need to drink
24 quarts of cow's milk a day to meet his iron requirements, which
would be impossible. He states many infants may drink from one to two
quarts of cow's milk a day, which satisfies their hunger to the point
that they do no have the appetite to consume enough of other foods
that do have a high iron content. The second way that cow's milk leads
to iron-deficiency anemia in many infants is a form of
gastrointestinal bleeding caused by increased mucus and diarrhea
associated with dairy consumption. &quot;It is estimated that half the
iron-deficiency in infants in the United States is primarily the
result of this form of cow milk induced gastrointestinal bleeding,&quot;
Dr. Oski writes. &quot;Mucus is frequent and some stools contain obvious
traces of bright red blood... The diarrhea impairs the infant's
ability to retain nutrients from his feedings. In addition, the
changes produced in the gastrointestinal tract by the allergic
reaction result in seepage of the child's own blood into the gut. This
loss of plasma and red cells leads to a lowering of the infant's blood
protein level and to the development of anemia.&quot;

The mucus created by dairy products causes other problems as well. It
is well-known that dairy products cause excessive mucus in the lungs,
sinuses and intestines. Dr. Ellis notes this excess mucus in the
breathing passages contributes to many respiratory problems and that
mucus hardens to form a coating on the inner wall of the intestines
that leads to poor absorption of nutrients, which can cause chronic
fatigue. This mucus also causes constipation, which can lead to many
other problems. Two very common problems with infants are colic and
ear infections, both of which can be caused by cow's milk. Medical
studies have found cow's milk can contribute to these problems either
directly, when the infant drinks cow's milk, or indirectly, when the
infant breast feeds from a mother who has been consuming dairy
products. Colic, suffered by one out of every five infants in the
U.S., is characterized by severe stomach cramps. The July/August 1994
issue of Natural Health reports, &quot;When a mother eats dairy products,
milk proteins pass into her breast milk and end up in the baby's
blood; some studies have found that cow's milk proteins (from milk
drunk by the mother) might trigger colick-like symptoms in infants fed
only human milk and no cow's milk.&quot; Concerning ear infections, Dr.
Northrup states, &quot;You just don't see this painful condition among
infants and children who aren't getting cow's milk into their
systems.&quot; The Natural Health article also notes, &quot;Removing dairy from
the diet has been shown to shrink enlarged tonsils and adenoids,
indicating relief for the immune system. Similarly, doctors
experimenting with dairy-free diets often report a marked reduction in
colds, flus, sinusitis and ear infections.&quot;

Another common problem for children is the bellyache. Dr. Oski states
in his book that up to 10 percent of all children in this country
suffer from a syndrome known as &quot;recurrent abdominal pain of
childhood.&quot; He says studies performed in Boston and San Francisco each
concluded &quot;that about one-third of such children had their symptoms on
the basis of lactose intolerance. The simple solution was to remove
all milk and milk-containing foods from the diet and watch for signs
of improvement.&quot; The Natural Health article also notes that antigens
in cow's milk may contribute to arthritis and osteoarthritis. &quot;When
antibody-antigen complexes (resulting from an immune response) are
deposited in the joints, pain, swelling, redness and stiffness result;
these complexes increase in arthritic people who eat dairy products,
and the pain fades rapidly after patients eliminate dairy products
from their diets. In a study published in Scandinavian Journal of
Rheumatology, when people with rheumatoid arthritis fasted on water,
fruit and vegetable juices, and tea for seven to ten days, their joint
pain and stiffness were greatly reduced. When they ate a
lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (including only milk and eggs as animal
foods), the symptoms became aggravated and they remained ill.&quot; A 1992
report in The New England Journal of Medicine also notes that cow's
milk can contribute to juvenile diabetes and autoimmune diseases by
impairing the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. The Natural
Health article also states a 1989 study published in Nutrition and
Cancer found a link between consumption of cow's milk and butter with
the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the immune
system. The article adds, &quot;High levels of the cow's milk protein
beta-lactoglobulin have also been found in the blood of lung cancer
patients, suggesting a link with this cancer as well.&quot;

Dr. Oski's book also cites studies by two scientists from the
University of Michigan who have conducted extensive research on
factors associated with multiple sclerosis. There is an unusual
geographic distribution of MS victims in the U.S. and throughout the
world, which has baffled medical researchers for decades. This
distribution of MS victims has no correlation to wealth, education or
quality of medical care. Dr. Oski notes the Michigan scientists found
in this pattern in the U.S. and 21 other countries, &quot;the only
significant link was between multiple sclerosis and average milk
consumption.&quot; Dr. Oski's book even cites a possible link between
excessive consumption of cow's milk and juvenile delinquency, based on
a study conducted in Tacoma, Wash. Dr. Oski writes, &quot;When the diets of
young criminals were contrasted with those of adolescents from a
similar background, it was found that the juvenile delinquents
consumed almost ten times the amount of milk that was drunk by the
control group. The juvenile offenders ate less fruit, nuts and
vegetables.&quot;

When a reasonable person considers all this evidence, it would be
difficult to still believe cow's milk is healthy for human
consumption. So, what do we drink instead? Dr. Oski partly answers
this question by writing, &quot;For the newborn infant, there are two
obvious alternatives -- the right and left breast of the healthy
mother.&quot; After a child is weaned, there is no reason to drink any
milk. We shouldn't drink any liquid with our meals because this
dilutes our digestive fluids. When we are thirsty, we should drink
distilled water. Or, if you want to drink something nutritional
between meals, the best choice is freshly-extracted vegetable juice.
