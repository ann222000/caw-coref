Thoughts of an Israeli Christian Arab.

by Solly Ganor

I had conversation with an Israeli Arab construction boss by the unlikely name
of Francis who was in charge of building a villa near our house in Herzelia. He
told me:

&quot;Your bungling war against a few thousand Hezbollah fighters which you should
have crushed no matter what, considering the importance of the outcome, has
created a completely new situation, not only for this area, but globally. Your
inept leadership totally misunderstood the importance of winning this war.&quot;

&quot;The Americans, the Europeans, and even you Israelis really don't know what it
is all about, do you? During the last generation hundreds of thousands of
children have been taught all over the Moslem world in Madrass schools to become
martyrs for Allah in order to kill the infidels. These youngsters not only are
ready to do it, but are actually in the process of doing it. Bombs are going off
all over the world killing and maiming thousands of people, not only on 9/11 in
the US, in London Madrid and Bali, but in Africa, India, Bangladesh, Egypt,
Saudi Arabia and many other places. The first signs of the Islamic Tsunami is
already here, but the West doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand
what is coming.&quot;

&quot;Now is the time to stop them, not only because they are developing nuclear
bombs, but because Iran has become the base for all Islamic terrorist. They
supply money, men, and weapons to Islamic terrorist around the world, quite
often through their diplomatic mail. Billions of petro-dollars that are pouring
into Iran are being funnelled into terrorist organizations world-wide. They
believe, and perhaps rightly so, that the West will do nothing to stop them in
achieving their goals.&quot;

&quot;Well, you Israelis, should better prepare yourself for another round against
Hezbollah. It will not be long in coming. It depends on the Iranians to give the
word. This time you will have to destroy Hezbollah no matter what the cost may
be.&quot; (If only Jews and the Israeli government would listen!)

Policy of Defeat.

The IDF announced Saturday it will reopen the Karni crossing even as terrorists
in Gaza continue their attacks on Israel.

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert continues to add concessions to the Palestinian
Authority, this time granting amnesty to 110 PA terrorists.

Food for Thought. by Steven Shamrak

&quot;Israel does not apologize!&quot; - One of many lame justifications from 'nice'
Israel-haters I have received. Do we hear apologies from UK or Spain for
deporting Jews or for Turkey's genocide of Armenians? Have any Arab/Muslim
countries apologized for supporting terror? Dear anti-Semites, please, do not
preach humanity and morality to the Jews, look in the mirror first!

One Sane Politician in America. American Republican presidential candidate Rudy
Giuliani has bucked the party line of successive US administrations and come out
against the establishment of a Palestinian state. &quot;Too much emphasis has been
placed on brokering negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians -
negotiations that bring up the same issues again and again. It is not in the
interest of the United States, at a time when it is being threatened by Islamist
terrorists, to assist the creation of another state that will support
terrorism.&quot; (For Israel, there is never a good time for the idea of another Arab
state on Jewish land! But still &quot;at a time&quot;?)

Gaza a Major Threat to Israel. Senior Israeli military officials say the
government ignored their warnings of what would happen to Gaza following the
2005 withdrawal. Hamas is believed to have at least 13,000 men under arms in
Gaza. The force has been trained by Hizballah and Iranians. The group has also
reportedly moved a huge quantity of advanced weapons and high-grade explosives
into Gaza since Israel surrendered control of the strip, including Katyusha
rockets, advanced anti-tank missiles and shoulder-launched anti-aircraft
missiles.

Fight of Mad Dogs. PA media are reporting clashes between Hamas and the Doghmush
clan in Gaza City's al-Sabra neighbourhood. The powerful clan, which held
journalist Alan Johnston, was hired out as mercenaries by both Fatah and Hamas,
but has resisted Hamas efforts to disarm it.

Hizbollah Buys Land to Attack Israel. Hizbollah is buying up large tracts of
land, north of the Litani River, owned by Christians and other non-Shias in
southern Lebanon as the militant group rebuilds its defences in preparation for
a new war with Israel. With no harassment from the 13,000 United Nations
peacekeepers.

Stupidity Unlimited Co . IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi elicited enthusiastic
applause from a largely Druze audience week ago when he told the crowd that in
the next life, he wants to be a Druze. (What a stupid thing to be said by a Jew!
It seems the current Israeli officials are breaking all limits of self-hate and
stupidity.)

Quote of the Week:

&quot;.even the most virulent of Israel's critics cannot blame the current barbarism
in Gaza on the Jews. After all, the Israelis withdrew, didn't they?&quot; - by Andrew
Sullivan. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

Two Out of Every 1,000 are Jews. The number of Jews in the world has remained
steady at about 13 million for a long time, but Jews today represent only two
out of every 1,000 people in the world, compared to 3.5 out of every 1,000 in
1970, 4.7 out of 1,000 in 1945, and 7.5 out of 1,000 in 1938. Israel is home to
5.4 million Jews. Last year it became the world's largest Jewish community,
passing the U.S. with its estimated 5.3 million Jews. (Assimilation, Christian
evangelic assault, anti-Israel propaganda, national apathy and basic lack of
understanding of what Jewishness means, nationhood - not just religion, is
tearing our people apart!)

Arafat's Doctor: His Blood had HIV. Late PA chairman Yasser Arafat's blood
contained the deadly HIV virus, Arafat's personal physician, Dr. Ashraf
al-Kurdi, told Jordanian media over the weekend.

Another Delusional. Tony Blair stepped into his new position as Quartet Middle
East envoy with hopes and dreams: &quot;Just imagine for a moment if this process
were moving forward again, just think how much hope there would be.&quot; (Only
affirmative and decisive action by Israel against her enemies can end the
conflict!)

Is India a New Partner? India will launch Israeli spy satellite called TechSar,
weighing about 260 kg. It is likely that some of the secret images will be made
available to India. The Indian Space Research Organisation are tight-lipped
about the nature of the mission.

Solar Power for Italy. An Israel-based electric company has completed
construction of Italy's first solar power station. The 50-kilowatt plant is part
of an order for a nationwide network of solar power stations, to be completed in
five years.

Forged Accusation.

by Sivani, (Israeli girl from MySpace)

Racist ideologies use the differences between peoples, such as race, religion,
gender, economic status, etc., as an excuse to oppress, discriminate, and
deprive people of their natural and most basic rights. Zionism, on the other
hand, sought and gained for the Jewish people the ability to rule themselves,
which is a basic right shared by every nation. In the Diaspora, Jews where
either oppressed by others or depended on the whims of the majority in the
countries where they lived. The whims often turned into persecutions and
pogroms.

The accusation that Zionism is racism is motivated by a simple reasoning: After
the Holocaust, it became unacceptable and ineffective to call Jews a subhuman
race. In the face of those horrors traditional anti-Semitism was seen as
barbaric and primitive.

Present day anti-Semites (a k a anti-Zionists) are trying to stick to the state
of Israel the false accusations of &quot;Racism&quot;, &quot;Apartheid&quot; and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;
in order to deny Jews their inherit and most basic right for self-rule and
self-determination, the right of every nation to be free.

Not all criticisms of Israel are anti-Semitism, but anti-Zionism denies basic
rights to Jews. Anti-Zionists commit an act of discrimination - Racism!
