Dried Daphnia at Brine Shrimp Direct

The thread &quot;Some things I just bought for aquarium ventures...&quot; reminded
me of this.

Quite some time ago I placed an order with Brine Shrimp Direct and I'm
happy with it, but one thing has always bothered me.  Perhaps niggled at
the back of my mind would be a better description than &quot;bothered&quot;.

In addition to great brine shrimp eggs at fabulous prices, I also ordered
a tub (8 oz) of dried daphnia:
&lt; http://www.brineshrimpdirect.com/c7/Dried-Daphnia-c36.html &gt;.   The item
description mentions particle sizes, but the actual product is really a
flake.  At the time I emailed BSD and they wrote back that the drying
process causes this flakifying.   I think their wording was something
along the lines that the drying process naturally results in a flake
product.

But I just can't shake the feeling that something isn't quite right there.
The fish seem to like it okay, but sometimes I suspect that I could feed
sawdust and the fish would eagerly scarf it down.

I think the smell may be affecting my opinion too.  It has this musty,
sort of old sawdust and dust bunnies smell.  Which may be perfectly normal
for dried daphnia.

Has anyone else tried out dried daphnia?  Did it come as a flake instead
of tiny individual dried critters?

The part that really bothers (niggles) me is I don't understand why one
would mention particle size in a description, if the actual product is
flakified.  The description says there's no binders, so to turn into
flakes, the dried critters must adhere to each other naturally somehow.

It just seems odd.  Does anyone else have experience with dried daphnia,
supposedly with no additional ingredients?

Nope. Just frozen daphnia here.

I have used freeze dried daphnia  and it comes  as small blocks,  much  the
same as freeze dried  brine shrimp , not really sure  just how much
nutrition is really lost as part of the process, although  it is supposed
not to make any change, Usually  I have a selection  of frozen foods such
as  bloodworm, brineshrimp, daphnia &amp; tubifex,  I also have  freeze dried
tubifex &amp; brineshrimp,  I have been looking at the  delicia gel packs  might
give them a try  soon .

A month ago or so when I thought I saw a worm protruding from a dead
swordtail, some folks recommended the de-worming food from a company
whose
name I can no longer remember.  :-)   If I was home I'd look it up,
but if
I was home, I'd never get around to writing this follow up.  Anyway,
folks
also expressed an interest in reading how the medicated foods worked
out.

This message only covers the de-worming food because I haven't worked
my
way around to the other two yet.  And it doesn't cover it very well,
because I'm not quite sure how I could tell how well it worked in my
situation.

I ordered their de-worming food, their anti-protozoan food, and their
anti-bacterial food.  I had a mystery death situation before the worm
sighting, so I figured I'd cycle the fish through the three foods in
hopes
of eliminating whatever it is, and then implement a strict quarantine
system for incoming fish.  I never used a quarantine tank before but
it
sure seems like pet store fish come with more hitchhikers than they
used
to, or I was too young &amp; dumb to notice it 20 years ago.

While I waited for the medicated foods to arrive, I fed some Tetra
brand
medicated food which was supposed to eliminate parasites.   It was
very
old (probably 3+ years) so I don't know what effect, if any, it had.
It
probably just provided poor nutrition.

The foods from ?, Guppy Traders?  Florida Guppy Traders?, I'm going to
call them FGT even though that may be wildly wrong.  The foods from
FGT
arrived in a normal to prompt mail order time frame.  The flakes come
in
sealed plastic bags, so one needs to provide one's own food
dispenser/container.

I had just found a cache of fish supplies in my parents' attic I had
forgotten about, which included large unopened canisters of 20 year
old
Kordon Superba Plankton and the smaller variety.   So I dumped the 20
year
old contents into the garbage, and refilled with the de-worming food
and
relabeled the two canisters.   One went into the freezer inside a zip
lock
bag.  The other I used.

The fish ate the de-worming food very eagerly.  I would say that they
showed more enthusiasm for it than for their regular flakes.  I fed it
for
ten days, twice a day to the exclusion of all other foods, which is
what
the instructions direct.

However, I'm not sure how to tell how effective it was or wasn't.  Our
swordtails were my primary concern.  It seems to me like they perked
up to
an even higher pitch of activity a few days into this food.  One
interesting thing is that while we have about three times as many
females
as males, several of the females seem to go long periods without
producing
any offspring.   After feeding the de-worming food it appeared that
every
female in the tank was carrying.   Do worms interfere with their
normal
reproductive process?   Or is the de-worming food a swordtail
aphrodisiac?

Anyway, all I can say with certainty is that the fish ate the
deworming
food enthusiastically, and I have not lost any other fish to worms, as
far
as I know.   If I was certain I still had infected fish, then I could
test
with more definition, but my situation is hazy and does not lend
itself to
clear test results.

While feeding the deworming food, I stopped giving the corys pellets
and
left them to scavenge deworming food too.  During this period they did
not
lay any eggs, which is unusual for them, but they had already stopped
laying eggs earlier (I think) when I was throwing so many dissolved
medications at my mystery death problem.

After I finished feeding deworming food, switched back to the regular
diet, and did a water change the corys started laying eggs again, but
in a
strange way.  They laid a few eggs at a time, very small quantities
compared to their normal spawns, but almost every day or every other
day.
After a couple of weeks they went back to their large production
spawns
with less frequency, habits.

I haven't run everyone through the anti-protozoan food yet, because
I've
been dealing with this leaking/leaked 30 gallon tank.  While the other
30
gallon is overcrowded I don't want to feed largish quantities of
medicated
food twice a day, and I do want to medicate all the the tanks
simultaneuusly.

One thing I would say I have learned myself is that planaria can
sometimes get up to a centimeter or a little larger in length
sometimes and I have found a dead fancy female guppy once in a while
being &quot;recycled&quot; by a planaria worm or two just like what a snail or
even a fish would do to a dead organic matter (cannibalism in the case
of fish eating other already dead fish). Summary - try not to panic,
maybe your right but calmness works for me and I don't regret it. Good
luck all and later! P.s. I have also found that planaria can be dark
colored sometimes too, and don't forget self-supporting tubifex worms
being in the gravel and filter media at times too.
