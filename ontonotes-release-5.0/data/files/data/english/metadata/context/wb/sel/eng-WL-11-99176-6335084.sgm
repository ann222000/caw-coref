Matt Gonzelez, former head of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (and, as such, the most important elected Green official in the country), and recent Green candidate for Mayor of San Francisco, explains why it makes sense to vote for Ralph Nader (assuming, of course, you agree with Nader's views). A small excerpt: "The stakes are not one presidential race, but rather whether a diversity of ideas will ever reach Congress. Without this reform there will only ever be one congressperson with the courage to oppose the war in Iraq. There will only be one senator to vote against the Patriot Act. This state of affairs is so bleak that pretending there is an opposition party in our two-party system can only charitably be called foolish."

Build your organization from the bottom up, not from the top down

how many Green Congress members are there ???

how many Green State legislators ???

Mayors ??? city council members ???

If Ralph were elected, he would soon be impeached and removed because he has no support in Congress

Witness Arnuld, he is not really a repuglican, so he can't rally the party. Now he has decided that the problem is the Democrates

Funny that 60% of the State's population could be the problem

Maybe the majority in California is right, but the repuglicans don't let that stop them

Sure, Matt Gonzelez wants you to vote for Ralph, but Matt doesn't say how a Nader Administration would be received

I presume you didn't read the article, because there isn't a single word in it which would lead you to believe that Matt Gonzalez is delusional and thinks Nader could possibly be elected. That isn't why he suggests voting for Nader, as you can read in his article. So the question of "how a Nader administration would be received" in the present circumstances is, to say the least, moot.

Granting all of Gonzalez's points, he doesn't address a major point: There are many ways in which the progressive electorate can express its displeasure with the positions of the Democrats.

Most of those ways - such as voting for third-party congresspeople, governers or local representatives - do not have the downside of increasing the chance that Bush stays in the white house.

Why not choose the safer alternatives? The absolutist all-or-nothing approach is not justified given that other approaches are available.
