Dear Friends,

I noticed that there is a petition drive for this Lord's Day to get
members to sign their endorsement of the pastoral lettter for peace
passed at the last General Synod. I also checked the UCC web site and
found both the letter and a &quot;Full Petiton Text.&quot; I am a bit confused
as to what people are being asked to sign for presention to the US
government.

Are any of you or your congregations participating in this?

I am a little dubious about the letter and petition text, though I
spoke out from the get go against going to war with Iraq. At this
point, it seems to me, it is &quot;You broke it, you bought it!&quot;

Any ideas?

Jim:
I'm with you on this. What would happen to this congregation were I to
urge the signing of the petition, letter or whatever is that the
hostility  which we sought to contain after GS 25 would once more come
to the surface and we would be back to where we stared. Like you, I have
opposed this &quot;war of choice&quot; from the beginning; although my youngest
son served two tours there as a USMC infantry officer. So often, and
maybe it is just me, even when I agree with the position taken on an
issue like this, the way it comes across from the UCC hdqs. is a kind of
self-righteousness and a grasping for the prophetic mantle. I've never
been a big fan of resolutions etc. because they have a tendency to
simplify things and I think that is the case with this one.

I am also the father of am active duty Marine who has been in Iraq several
times.

I don't get the reluctance to offer this letter to the congregation.  It is
not like we are saying it is God's will or they must sign; we printed it in
our last newsletter,  we asked people to read and consider it, and if they
felt like it, they could sign - and we have volunteers who have made a
little table and are collecting signatures - for those who choose to sign.

The reluctance to offer something to the people for their own decision and
action or inaction - why?

My problem with the pastoral letter is it is too long.

But to object to letting people make up their own minds and decide for
themselves - that is odd to me.

I also am of the opinion that the church ought to be speaking out against
war.  Blessed are the peacemakers and all that - sometimes we have it mean
something - I am reminded of the people to whom Martin Luther King wrote the
Letter from a Birmingham Jail - those who said not now, the church can't be
involved, this is too radical...

Dear Jim, John, Vince,  I am uncertain about the peace or anti war
resolution.  I have not looked at it carefully.  My fear is that the middle
class has never really connected to this war.  There was nothing that we had
to give, we suffered very few deaths and our hands seem clean.  At the same
time our nations defeat in Iraq may have serious effects on our national
life.  There is an interesting article in the recent New Yorker on preparing
for defeat and living with the tragedy and we are not good at defeat and
tragedy.  I hope we don't feel self righteous about our anti war stance.

Dear Herb, John and VInce,

I also read the New Yorker article and was a bit more persuaded that
we need to remain in Iraq in force. Again, &quot;We broke it, we bought
it.&quot; I don't like the pastoral letter's sloppy generalities concerning
violence and war. But who knows, given all this Blackwater business we
might have no choice but to leave and leave quickly. The point about
the need for a new course involving multinational and local states'
cooperation was right in keeping with the New Yorker seemed to be
indicating. But the current administration seems deaf to calls for
diplomacy, and actually more intent than ever to rattle swords with
Iran.

I think the suffering is hitting closer to home for more and more of
us. The only brother of my pastor was killed two months ago in Iraq. I
have one member of my congregation serving in Iraq and another member
with a grandson who has just been sent over.

Gracious God, remove from us the scourge of war! Amen!

Jim

It is not the pastoral letter that I would have written.  It is the pastoral
letter that we have.  We've had a good number of congregational main members
sign at our place.  There's a sence that people want to express their
opinions and do it through the church.

At our place the fact the my son is active duty Marine and has been in Iraq
several times deflects the &quot;not supporting the troops' thing.  Oh, and the
fact that I pointed to my grandson one Sunday during the sermon and pondered
how many times he has to have a father (and my son) return to a war zone for
a war that no one supports anymore.  And yes that went over very well in
conservative western Michigan.

And yes, we know Blackwater  very well out here, since it comes from
Holland, Michigan.  Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, a major beneficiary
of Iraq contracts let out by the US government, with his father, Edgar
Prince, helped Gary Bauer start the Family Research Council. Late 1980s the
group officially became a division of Dobson's main organization Focus on
the Family.  We know Blackwater and the Prince family as very right wing
religio-politico persuasion who have been funding conservative right wing
religious and political causes (hard to tell which is which) for many years.

If we wait for the perfect letter to come, it will not and we do nothing.
We have what we have, and imperfect vessel it is, it allows us to do
something -

it allows us to offer this to the congregation for their consideration.

We also ran it through the Missions Department (with 100% endorsement) and
the Governing Board before we put the text in the newsletter with a &quot;for
your consideration&quot; introduction.

The predominant response here is after these years, the church is finally
doing something.

on Blackstone:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's hard to imagine that the cronyism that has marked the Bush
&gt; Administration is not at play in Blackwater's success. Blackwater founder
&gt; Erik Prince shares Bush's fundamentalist Christian views. He comes from a
&gt; powerful Michigan Republican family and social circle, and his father,
&gt; Edgar, helped Gary Bauer start the Family Research Council. According to a
&gt; report prepared for The Nation by the Center for Responsive Politics, in all
&gt; of Erik Prince's political funding generosity since 1989, he has never given
&gt; a penny to a Democrat running for national office. Company president Jackson
&gt; has also given money to Republican candidates. For his part, Joseph
&gt; Schmitz-the former Pentagon Inspector General turned general counsel to
&gt; Blackwater's parent, The Prince Group-lists on his resume membership in the
&gt; Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Christian militia formed before the
&gt; First Crusade. Like Prince, he comes from a right-wing family; his father,
&gt; former Congressman John Schmitz, was an ultraconservative John Birch Society
&gt; director who later ran for President. Joseph Schmitz was once in charge of
&gt; investigating private contractors like Blackwater, but he resigned amid
&gt; allegations of stonewalling investigations conducted by his department. He
&gt; now represents one of the most successful of those contractors.

&gt; Schakowsky charges that the Administration has written Blackwater &quot;blank
&gt; checks,&quot; saying that the internal DHS review of the company &quot;leaves us with
&gt; more questions than answers.&quot; She points out that the report fails to
&gt; address the major issues stemming from deploying private forces on US
&gt; streets. In her testimony this past September, Schakowsky said, &quot;Ask any
&gt; American if they want thugs from a private, for-profit company with no
&gt; official law-enforcement training roaming the streets of their
&gt; neighborhoods. The answer will be a resounding NO.&quot;

&gt; Blackwater's ascent comes in the midst of a major rebranding campaign
&gt; aimed at shaking its mercenary image. The company is at the forefront of the
&gt; trade association of mercenary firms, the International Peace Operations
&gt; Association, which lobbies for even greater privatization of military
&gt; operations. Blackwater and its cause have clearly found serious backing in
&gt; the Bush Administration. Hiring Blackwater, says Schakowsky, &quot;may be legal,
&gt; but it is not a good deal for taxpayers and Gulf region residents in
&gt; particular.&quot; Blackwater's sweetheart deals, both domestic and international,
&gt; are representative of how business has been done under Bush. They are a
&gt; troubling indicator of a trend toward less accountability and transparency
&gt; and greater privatization of critical government functions. It's time that
&gt; more members of Congress ask tough questions about Blackwater and its rapid,
&gt; profitable rise.

I have not and will not be bringing this to the congregation's
attention.  I might have if it were merely the pastoral letter; but
the petition is linked to it.

I won't for several reasons:
1) The Pastoral Letter, in my opinion, isn't a pastoral letter but a
position piece.  It also presents a hierarchy of importance of lives
lost (American, US military and then finally, the Iraquis).
2) Over 57% of the country is  now against the war.  This feels to me
more like jumping on the bandwagon and grandstanding than a Christian
based effort or a call to repentance by the UCC.
3) It fails to address the realities of what happens when we leave;
I've been against this war since it was first hinted at, and took the
abuse at time from those who were convinced that we had to do this
when I dared to suggest that if we did this, we'd end up in an urban
Vietnam with an enemy that didn't fit conventionally, and would get
bogged down there.  But the reality is that right now, we've assisted
in creating the enviroment that has led to the disingreation of order
and safety in Iraq.  I know WWJD before starting this war (he wouldn't
have); I'm still struggling with what we do as Christians now that
this situation is what it is.
5) The &quot;theology&quot; expressed by many at the beginning of this war was
flawed in my opinion; this letter and petition are in many ways just
as flawed.

I signed the petition personally;  but I don't think members of my
congregaiton are lacking in  ways to speak out about this war.  So for
at least the time being, the pastoral letter sits in a file on my
desk.  Instead of light on the issue, I just think this particular
effort muddies the waters.

God's grace and peace,
Deb K.

Deb and others -

I am seeking a way to express myself that will not sound as if I am saying
&quot;I am right and you are wrong&quot; because there are always many ways to look at
anything, I can only share my perspective, but I want to say this is a way
that is not confrontational or dismissive or anything negative; I am
attempting to share from my heart.

Perhaps it is a different understanding of church, and ordained ministry.
I am a servant.  I am not the gate keeper.  I am not the decider.  I am the
theologian in residence simultaneously being one of the community of the the
believers, in the priesthood of all believers.  I am not the authority.
Christ is.

Deb, to me, and this is not a judgment, this is only my own feeling, is that
you are acting as the gatekeeper because you are deciding what the people in
the parish can or cannot see and what they can and cannot consider.  We are
not the Pope in the parish.   Thus when you say &quot;I don't think members of my
congregation are lacking in ways to speak out about this war... the pastoral
letter sits in a file on my desk.. &quot;  I will most definitely not say
&quot;splendid Deb&quot; because that is the voice of authoritarianism, because that
is everything I am against in church: one person - be it pope or whatever
hierarchical name we give the big brother or super nanny or whoever it is
that decides - that sits censoring and filtering and deciding what others
get to consider.

I have a different image of the Church and church, I am sure.  I tend to
believe that the larger church has a better perspective than I; it is more
likely that what the Spirit is leading us to understand will be in the
collective decisions of the community rather than my own biases and feelings
and opinions.  I think the pastoral letter is long, it is wordy, it needs
editing.

And granted I belong to the UCC, not some congregationalist church, but what
type of congregational heritage is it when one person - be it pastor or lay
- who decides what the congregation gets to see and not see?  We are members
of the United Church of Christ.  I serve as servant a congregation (or if
you will, local church) that is a member of the UCC.  No one elected me as
god or pope or Oz or Mr(Ms) Know It All who gets to decide what they get to
look at and what they don't.  They are the church, I am but its servant.
(&quot;They&quot; are the church - that sentence operates on two levels here of
course.  The local congregation is the local church - the UCC is the church
- I know some hold to the nostalgia we are a collection of congregations,
but we are the United Church of Christ and whether we are united, we are
Church and we are of Christ)

So the UCC does something, such as the pastoral letter - signed by our
collegium, signed by GS26 - on what grounds do I exercise an authority not
given to me to decide the people don't need it, or shouldn't see it, or in
any other way should not be allowed to make up their own minds about
something that comes from the larger church?

There is nothing that gives me the authority to sit in the place of judgment
and decide what the people can and cannot see - even more so than when it
comes from the church body.

(Now that is one way we differ; many consider it a &quot;denomination&quot; which is a
divisive term; I consider the UCC a &quot;church body&quot; in the one holy catholic
and apostolic church.  The UCC is not to be a denomination separate from
others, or denomination as in a voluntary association like the Elks or the
Eagles; it is that part of the Church in which I participate.  And my
ecclesiology and my pastoral calling do not permit me to think that &quot;I&quot; as
&quot;pastor&quot; have some authority to decide what the people can and cannot see.
I am called to serve, not to substitute my judgment for communication.  We
are pastors, not the givers of our own imprimaturs on what is acceptable for
others to look at; Deb, I strongly reject your ecclesiology and
understanding of ministry here.)

I did think it was too long out loud at worship to read and besides only a
portion of the people would then hear it, so we printed it in our
newsletter.  The whole congregation saw it.  The church asked us to do
something - offer it - so I did what was asked.  No one has yet asked my
opinion.  Some of our laity are staffing a table in the lobby where it is
being discussed and many, not all, are signing.  If anyone were to object to
it, I would to listen to them.  But to offer &quot;for your consideration... do
as you will&quot; is hardly some intrusive act - but it is an act I can do
because I don't make decisions for them, they can make their own
decisions.   If they want to tell me they have other avenues to act, so be
it - although many do, they are also happy to see their church doing
something, saying something, after all this time.

Deb, if you are unhappy with the letter, why not offer it to your people as
we were asked by our church and have an adult study or discussion group or
even a congregational get together and share your feelings and listen to
theirs?  In your procedure Deb, when do the people get their chance to speak
- when do you listen - on this matter?  (And I know that we all know exactly
what our people think on any specific issue or matter because we all know
them so well and have such perfect understanding...  no, we don't.  We
don't.  I never presume or assume to know what the people are thinking until
they tell me.  I am their servant, not their censor, decider, or the Pope; I
humbly suggest acting as the doorkeeper is to assume a role that is not ours
to take on.)

There have been times, in the LCA and ELCA and now in the UCC, when I have
not been happy or in total alignment with something that is said or done by
the church body.  I feel that I can share that with the congregation - IF
THEY ARE FULLY INFORMED AND NOT HAVING ME CENSOR THEIR INFORMATION - and
often in those situations I have been very surprised by the things expressed
by the people.  I have learned much by presenting and then listening.  We
have worked through things together.  I don't keep things from them.  I am
not mommy who decides what my 2 year old can see, or big brother in the
Orwellian sense who would think what you have done is splendid indeed
because you are making decisions like you (and not Christ) are the authority
for the people who have to live with what you decide (rather than exist in
community where everyone has voice and we decide by consensus and clergy are
a voice, not the only voice).

It is the methodological presuppositions that disturb me.

Especially when it comes to the UCC.

So many people trash it - but they don't trust the people of God to have
full knowledge, full information, full insights, full participation - in
church - despite the fact that that is a self-image assumed by some of the
most dictatorial, authoritative people I know in the clergy.

If you decided to trust the people, they may read it and think the UCC is
horrid and vote to leave - and perhaps they should.  They may think it is
the best thing they have read in years - and won't you be surprised (and
thus informed and thus a better servant to them).  They may not make that
much of it - those who like it will be happy and others will ignore it.

But whether any of those or some other option - it will then be their
decision, not yours.  And it should be theirs.  That would be splendid.

Trusting the people - really living in community - not one person decides
for others - it does work.

Vince,

Thanks for your thoughts on this. I am sure Deb can speak her own mind on this but I do look at this differently.

Your perspective is that we are 'authoritarian' or take the job of the 'gatekeeper' if we do not bring everything that comes to us through Cleveland to our people in the worship settings.

My perspective is that I have been here over 12 years and I know my people. They do not want to see everything that comes from Cleveland, or from Rome or from Geneva in the worship setting. All of my parishioners get their own copy of the UCC News at their homes. They also know about the UCC webpage. Some people love both. SOme have no interest in either. They (hopefully) come to learn in Sunday School or hear God's word in worship. I see my perspective as one of honoring them.  If they want to sign something they can do it through those two venues which I am happy to encourage them to participate in. But to bring this up to them again in worship for them takes away from their seeking &quot;the one thing that is needful.&quot;

Vince:

Bravo for your diatribe against Deb &amp; (for my calling her attitude &amp; action
&quot;splendid&quot;) me! You experienced over-priesting among the Lutherans, &amp; hate
to see it where in your judgment it appears in the UCC.  My enthusiasm for
your post is (in addition to your vigorous defense of what your believe)
from your use of all the factors involved in &quot;doing ecclesiology&quot; (as a
branch of &quot;doing theology&quot;).  I must make these comments:

1    You say Deb was authoritarian vis-a-vis her people, but you seem to
allow for an authoritarian voice above Deb in the UCC structure: &quot;The church
[the UCC] asked....I did what was asked.&quot;  Two understandings of the UCC
pastor: Deb the &quot;doorkeeper&quot; (protecting her folk from the propaganda hail
from Cleveland, &amp; claiming to be listening to a higher Voice) &amp; Vince the
&quot;servant&quot; (of Christ-in-the-[UCC]-Church).  Two honorable understandings.

2    UCC pastors should encourage their folk to take and read the UNITED
CHURCH NEWS.  So much good &amp; needed news (admixed, yes, with so much
propaganda, much of it yes-saying to the concerns of American
&quot;progressives&quot;).  I agree that pastors should not block everything coming
from Cleveland: beginning in 1960 (when I joined the national UCC branch
then in Cleveland!), I experienced that blockage: I was in charge of the
literature of devotion/worship/evangelism/renewal.  DOWN with those pastors
who kept me from getting through to their people!  (It wasn't easy for me to
say &quot;splendid&quot; to Deb, Vince.)

3    I've no doubt that your people's response to your offering them
opportunity to sign the Cleveland petition was (as you put it) &quot;happy to see
the church doing something, saying something, after all this time.&quot;  That in
itself worries me.  Americans are so war-frustrated that it's a relief to be
able to do something: anything is better than doing nothing.  But sometimes,
doing nothing is better than do some-thing--&amp; it's always better than doing
anything.  (On the wall in my NYTSeminary office I had a poster I'd made [in
Hebrew]: &quot;DON'T JUST DO SOMETHING, STAND THERE!&quot;)

4    As a pastor, I would says yes &amp; no to both Deb and you.  I would
denounce the petition &amp; set it out for signatures.  People need to exercise
their freedom of speech &amp; have courage to witness.  (My next week's &quot;On
Faith&quot; column is titled, &quot;Freedom to Speak, Courage to Witness.&quot;)

5    Your people are too ignorant--the American people are too ignorant--to
know whether to get out of Iraq.  (I make the point extensively in
&quot;Rejecting Moralism and Cynicism,&quot; my June 25 &quot;On Faith&quot; column &amp; was
denounced by dozens of activists on both sides!)  In his THE AGE OF
TURBULENCE, Alan Greenspan wonders whether human beings are smart enough to
make intelligent decisions in such complicated matrices we must now live
with.  Activist Harvey Cox's 1960s poster denounced inactivism: &quot;NOT TO
DECIDE IS TO DECIDE.&quot;  We do know that we the people have put effective
pressure on government with both good &amp; disastrous results.  The present
populist groundswell to &quot;Bring the troops home!&quot; is, in my opinion, not
helpful toward ascertaining the best that can be made of a badly bungled
war.

Grace and peace--
Willis

Vince:

We really aren't that far off from each ohter.  I too see ordained
ministry as a servant, but as a servant leader.  It took me a while to
appreciate both the difference and the need for the difference between
the two.

Like it or not, ordained ministers who become pastors, even in non-
hierarchial denominations, are leaders.  We are called to do so, and
are failing (in my opinion and learning) if we don't embrace that part
as much as we embrace the servant part.  We aren't dictators or
authoritarians. But as leaders, we have been entrusted by the
congregation with certain decisions.For instance, I chose each week
what Scripture passage to preach on, and the point of my sermon.  I
even chose the form, occassionally using a monologue, drama, or
experiential format.  I don't give the congregation all the options
each week, both of Scripture and form, and have them choose - they've
entrusted me with that. And I've been entrusted with other matters
also.    And as I said before - I have several very deep concerns
about both the letter and the petition that I beleive fall under the
area of my pastoral servant leadership of this congregation.

When it comes to what we receive for sharing with the congregation
from UCC settings - if I shared all of it with everyone, there would
be an overwhelming volume of material and it would become merely
noise.  I've tried it and that's been the concensus - I am the mail
persona and thus I am entrusted to sort through and discard as
indicated or my discression.  I do share the overarching sources for
people to use - the UCCnews and website for example, as well as
attempting to use UCC produced materials whenever possible when I'm
teaching and in services. I've even encouraged specific people to
participate in workships, seminars and the such.   However, as I look
at the &quot;mailings&quot; I receive (and I do mean that I receive, the ones
addressed to Rev. or Pastor Deb Kunkel) not only from the UCC but from
organizations within the UCC and outside the UCC that are to be shared
with the congregation -well our bulletin board is already filled, our
newsletter stuffed and our worship service filled when I share only a
portion of this.  I try to highlight the most important, the areas I
know are of interest, or ones that bring to light new informationn or
concerns.  This pastoral letter and petition didn't meet those for me
- as well as my other concerns with whether this was a pastoral
letter.  Most of the rest does stay in files that I have so if someone
comes looking for information/resources/training or even discussion on
a particular subject or area, I have it to give to them.

Part of the covenantal responsibility is to seriously consider and
pray on what comes from our other settings; but we also have the
autonomy to decide not to act on it if we want.  I want to get the
most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; when I do use my pastoral authority and voice
to step behind something.  For me, right now that is the Neighbors in
Need Offering and the visioning process I am trying to get the
congregation to understand and embark on.  I have neither the time nor
the expertiese nor the resources to offer adult study/discussion
issues on every issue that comes down the pike; I do regularly ask for
input about what the CONGREGATION, and not just I, am interested, want
to discuss or study together, encouraging them to come together even
(gasp!) without me as they are perfectly capable of doing so, and in
fact should be doing so.

I've heard the gatekeeper description used before to describe what I
do.  Personally, having grown up in the Roman Catholic Church, I don't
see what I'm doing as  that.  I view it more as being an editor for a
particular venue.  I do not tell anyone what they can or cannot read/
see/discuss.  I do not ban things, censure things or tell them that
they are bad if they look at/consider things.  However, I do get to
decide what I will share, what I will provide, what I will emphasize,
as directed and discerened by the congregation.  I wasn't voted Pope,
but I was voted as Pastor, who in our constitutiion is &quot;the spiritual
leader of the parish and general administrator of the church&quot;.
Censorship is &quot;you are muffled/others are blocked from hearing or
seeing this&quot; and the goal is to keep it completely out of sight of an
intended party or group; that is not the same thing as me saying that
I will not be using my limited time/resources to present this.

I have to laugh Vince, nothing personal, when you talk about this
sounding like an authoritarian voice, for 95% of the time, I  hardly
function like that.  My congregation, especially the council, says
half-jokingly that I make them &quot;think&quot; too much because I don't just
make most of the decisions myself, but push them for input and
discernment.  At times I do claim my pastsoral authority, but in terms
of this letter, I see it more as fulfilling the direction of the
congregation that called me.   I just had this conversation with a
Methodist pastor friend, and she was commenting that she wasn't sure
if she'd be able to pastor in a situation like ours, which she
understood as lacking a voice of authority since I 1)didn't have a
Book of Discipline to reference and back myself up with and 2) in her
opinion I have to inordantly consider how I exercise my authority so
as not to &quot;offend&quot; people and risk my position.  I don't see my
actions as being authoritarian - it is not like the R.C. Priest in my
youth who told me 1) I could not join Rainbow for it was sinful; 2)
that I had no voice other than liturgist as a leader in the
congregation and never would because of my gender, or 3) that I had to
go to Confession and be absolved by him before I could partake in
Communion...among other things he declared. Exercising my authority to
make these decisions - yes; but that's a long way from
authoritarian.

You seem to infer that I do not trust the people to be able to decide
on their own; could I not claim the same about the Collegium?  It's
not a matter of my trusting or not trusting the congregation - it's a
matter of what they have ENtrusted in me.

Finallly, to what level do I need to bring forth  information from the
larger church to not be considered a gatekeeper?  Put all in the
newsletter (JWM releases, press releases, statements/sermons/addresses
from the collegium and conference and association ministers) as well
as observe every &quot;Special Sunday&quot; that is listed in the Calendar?
Share it all from the pulpit? Or is putting it on the bulletin board
enough(if I had one large enough!)? Placing it in an &quot;inbox&quot; for
people to sort through?  Letting everyone know &quot;We've got mail!&quot; and
letting them sort through it?  Remember, what I am doing isn't
something that &quot;I&quot; decided to do, but that I discussed with the
congregational leaders (the Council) and do as was agreed to by them
and me.

Vince, I serve a congregation of approx 110 members, 40-50 worshiping
each Sunday.  In a congregation of 1000 with multiple specialized
committees or ministries, I probably would have forwarded this to the
Social Justice or Mission Committee for them to decide what action to
take.  But in this context, in this particular instance, as pastor
I've been entrused to make those type of decisions.  The congregation
knows and I remind them of how they can get information about and from
the wider UCC - so I disagree with your comparision of what I am doing
to either the Pope or to a 1984 Orwellian scenario.  Like Chris said
above, I see this as part of my honoring this congregation: honoring
that they discerned something in me that led them to call me to this
position, honoring the trust that they put in me by being willing to
make the decisions that they've entrusted to me, and honoring them
enough to beleive that if they truly felt called to take an action
such as this, they would have made it known much sooner than over 5
years into this war.  I also honor them enough to beleive that if I am
mistaken about this particular instance, that they will forgive me and
we will both learn from it and become more of a community in Christ
because of it.

God's grace and peace,
Deb Kunkel

It seems to me no more likely that the Spirit speaks
through large organizations, even the church, than
through small ones, or even individuals.   God has a
surprising way of speaking through the solitary voice
as well as through proclamations from instituions.
Surely we must always listen to what the larger church
says, just as the larger church ought to listen to its
individual members.   But it's not always clear to me
that the collective community has a better
perspective, or is even more free of biases, feelings,
and opinions.

Vince:

In my Sec.5 to you, why did I say &quot;Your people are too ignorant--the
American people are too ignorant--to know whether to get out of Iraq&quot;
INSTEAD OF saying &quot;too under-informed&quot;?  Because no amount of additional
information can penetrate the darkness of UNAVOIDABLE IGNORANCE.

Make one bad chess move (which &quot;seemed like a good idea at the time&quot;) &amp; it's
your fault: knowledge of possible counter-moves was possible, for their
number was finite.  Make one bad foreign-policy move, &amp; it's only partly
your fault: the number of counter-moves is virtually infinite, beyond your
possible knowledge.  The &quot;men&quot; in the chess case have only a very limited
number of moves: the &quot;men&quot; in the foreign-policy case have a virtually
unlimited number of ways of reacting, so their reacting is radically
unpredictable even when seeming predictable.

Our religion teaches us the HUMILITY of the indeterminate.  In showing none
of this humility, the Peace Petition is theologically lacking.  (I'm
suggesting that Confessing Christ might &quot;do theology&quot; by theologically
critiquing the Peace Petition.)

1    Consider the arrogance &amp; folly of the Petition's claim that &quot;arrogance
and folly&quot; are &quot;at the heart of&quot; our side in the Iraq war.  How about oil?
The West will do whatever is necessary to prevent any political thrombosis
in the flow of oil to the West; within this basic eco-political necessity,
the West should try to benefit the peoples of the Middle East.  Human beings
cannot know how these major &amp; minor purposes would be affected by our soon
pull-out of American troops.  One thread of projected consequences sees Iran
dominating the Middle East &amp; using nuclear blackmail to prevent further
military intrusion into the Middle East; Israel (taking seriously Iran's
threat to destroy the State of Israel) preemptively striking Iran's nuclear
facilities; massive UN sanctions (blocked by the USA) against Israel....

2    While we pray &amp; hope for sources of energy alternative to OIL, the need
for oil-flow from the Middle East will increase (China being an ever large
bidder) for the foreseeable future.  Would it not be &quot;folly&quot; for the USA to
have a foreign policy vis-a-vis the Middle East lacking this central, brute,
physical, eco-political reality?  With Rein.Niebuhr as a UCC forefather, is
it not embarrassing that this UCC Petition utterly lacks Niebuhrian realism?
(Of course it's naive to expect USG rhetoric to include &quot;oil.&quot;  The rhetoric
must take the shape of a doughnut of sound around the silent center (oil).
Or should the UCC call for more honest rhetoric?)

3    Embarrassing also is it that the Petition is in violation of fact.
It's not true that we started the Iraq war with &quot;violence as the first,
rather than the last resort&quot; (so many moves for peace following the '91
war).  And it's not true that it was a case of &quot;unilateralism&quot; (eight
nations in the alliance).

4    Bush is denounced for letting his conservative Christianity have too
much influence on his decision-making.  But has he ever said anything as
out-of-it as this in the Petition: &quot;security is found in submitting to
Christ, not by dominating others.&quot;
What a confusion of church &amp; state! The Petition is telling the USG
(principally, Bush) to expect Christ is provide security for the USA?  And
another confusion: Cleveland wants to rally the (UCC) spiritual troops to
war-by-petition against a political policy of (physical) war in Iraq!  (Or
is the Petition really an in-house propaganda piece, in the &quot;progressive&quot;
mode of Cleveland?)

5    I fear populism, waves of collective feeling drowning the delayed
decision-making without which humanity's God-given reason doesn't get a
hearing.  Always, when a war gets old, anti-government forces converge to
banner the people with &quot;BRING THE TROOPS HOME!&quot; and &quot;NO MORE WAR!&quot; and....
Instead of being theologically sturdy &amp; a solid Christian witness, the
Petition is only populist.

Subject: Re: UCC Petition Drive

Vince:

Bravo for your diatribe against Deb &amp; (for my calling her attitude &amp;
action &quot;splendid&quot;) me! You experienced over-priesting among the Lutherans, &amp;
hate to see it where in your judgment it appears in the UCC.  My enthusiasm
for your post is (in addition to your vigorous defense of what your believe)
from your use of all the factors involved in &quot;doing ecclesiology&quot; (as a
branch of &quot;doing theology&quot;).  I must make these comments:

1    You say Deb was authoritarian vis-a-vis her people, but you seem to
allow for an authoritarian voice above Deb in the UCC structure: &quot;The church
[the UCC] asked....I did what was asked.&quot;  Two understandings of the UCC
pastor: Deb the &quot;doorkeeper&quot; (protecting her folk from the propaganda hail
from Cleveland, &amp; claiming to be listening to a higher Voice) &amp; Vince the
&quot;servant&quot; (of Christ-in-the-[UCC]-Church).  Two honorable understandings.

2    UCC pastors should encourage their folk to take and read the UNITED
CHURCH NEWS.  So much good &amp; needed news (admixed, yes, with so much
propaganda, much of it yes-saying to the concerns of American
&quot;progressives&quot;).  I agree that pastors should not block everything coming
from Cleveland: beginning in 1960 (when I joined the national UCC branch
then in Cleveland!), I experienced that blockage: I was in charge of the
literature of devotion/worship/evangelism/renewal.  DOWN with those pastors
who kept me from getting through to their people!  (It wasn't easy for me to
say &quot;splendid&quot; to Deb, Vince.)

3    I've no doubt that your people's response to your offering them
opportunity to sign the Cleveland petition was (as you put it) &quot;happy to see
the church doing something, saying something, after all this time.&quot;  That in
itself worries me.  Americans are so war-frustrated that it's a relief to be
able to do something: anything is better than doing nothing.  But sometimes,
doing nothing is better than do some-thing--&amp; it's always better than doing
anything.  (On the wall in my NYTSeminary office I had a poster I'd made [in
Hebrew]: &quot;DON'T JUST DO SOMETHING, STAND THERE!&quot;)

4    As a pastor, I would says yes &amp; no to both Deb and you.  I would
denounce the petition &amp; set it out for signatures.  People need to exercise
their freedom of speech &amp; have courage to witness.  (My next week's &quot;On
Faith&quot; column is titled, &quot;Freedom to Speak, Courage to Witness.&quot;)

5    Your people are too ignorant--the American people are too
ignorant--to know whether to get out of Iraq.  (I make the point extensively
in &quot;Rejecting Moralism and Cynicism,&quot; my June 25 &quot;On Faith&quot; column &amp; was
denounced by dozens of activists on both sides!)  In his THE AGE OF
TURBULENCE, Alan Greenspan wonders whether human beings are smart enough to
make intelligent decisions in such complicated matrices we must now live
with.  Activist Harvey Cox's 1960s poster denounced inactivism: &quot;NOT TO
DECIDE IS TO DECIDE.&quot;  We do know that we the people have put effective
pressure on government with both good &amp; disastrous results.  The present
populist groundswell to &quot;Bring the troops home!&quot; is, in my opinion, not
helpful toward ascertaining the best that can be made of a badly bungled
war.

Willis,

Thank you ever so much for making a special post just to restate that the
people that I serve, as well as the American people, and I have to presume,
myself, are too ignorant and live in such unavoidable ignorance because
nothing, no information, can penetrate our ignorance.  Damn, we are
ignorant.  I thank God for the elitism that allows you few to - I guess
'cast aspersions on the rest of us' is too harsh a phrase - so I will thank
God for the elitism that allows you few to insult the rest of us and tell us
what to think, as ignorant as we are.  I really wish I was one of the
superior ones ---- no I don't, I really am glad to find my identification as
a human, a baptized person, and a pastor, with the ignorant, for it is here,
amongst the ignorant, wherein we find Christ.

It does impress me so much that in your rare world where you judge the rest
of us to be so unavoidably ignorant that no information can penetrate our
ignorance that you speak of the quote &quot;Our religion teaches us the HUMILITY
of the indeterminate.&quot;  I am just so impressed that those elites like you
have to tolerate people like I serve, the American people, and me, people
who are so unavoidably ignorant that no information can penetrate our
ignorance.. and  yet you are humble!  You are like a super hero!

But as an ignorant one, knowing that no information can penetrate my
ignorance, I have to comment that if a pastor has to be  &quot;protecting her
folk from the propaganda hail from Cleveland, then maybe that pastor ought
leave the UCC.  If that which comes from our national church headquarters is
such a propaganda hail that ignorant people have to be protected from
it...   Such a suspicious and paranoid way to live vis a vis the national
church is too difficult for everyone involved.  I can't imagine a situation
where I would ever feel that way about that which came from the national
office, that people (ignorant though they be) need protection from it, and I
would not be a part of a church that I felt threatened my people.

I humbly (trying to be like you) close this with these observations: in your
first first post about such ignorant folks as I, you said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bravo for your diatribe against Deb &amp; (for my calling her attitude &amp;
&gt; action &quot;splendid&quot;) me! You experienced *over-priesting* among the
&gt; Lutherans,
">

What I wrote  was not a diatribe, in intent or actuality.  It was a very
different opinion.  I am so quickly learning that in some circles, well, at
least the self-decribed &quot;ecot&quot; ones, differing viewpoints are to be
ridiculed and the people who have those differing opinions insulted.  But
what do we know, us ignorant ones who dare to differ in our ignorant
thoughts?   (If you want to characterize this, it also is not a diatribe.

And when did I ever experience &quot;over-priesting&quot; in among the Lutherans?  Had
the ELCA not adopted its current policies towards gays and lesbians, I'd
still be Lutheran serving I guess equally as ignorant people as I do in the
UCC (but I being ignorant wouldn't know the difference.)  I just read today
when retired presiding Bishop Herb Chilstrom said that he has &quot;reason to
hope that one of these days our church [ELCA], like the United Church of
Christ and a handful of others, will take the big step and wipe out all
restrictions for those in such faithful partnerships, assuming they are
qualified on all other grounds.&quot;
http://www.startribune.com/562/story/1438486.html

I now what to share what I did yesterday: I was installed by the association
as associate pastor.  This is how the ignorant do it in western Michigan: we
opened with Veni Creator Spiritus sung by two choir members, were welcomed
by a member of the youth group who stated the five historical commitments of
the UCC (even the open the affirming one... we like to sin boldly), sang the
psalm, used all three lessons (and even called the one reading from the
Common Covenant), sang the alleluia verse, stood for the alleluia verse and
the gospel, affirmed our faith with the Nicene Creed, prayed for our fellow
believers including the members of Temple B'nai Israel (some of their folks
attended). did not sing the doxology but sang something we learned at GS 26,
had children bring the wine (and juice) and bread to the altar, had a
chanted preface (I do chant well even for an ignorant one), of course sang
the Agnus Dei, over 80% of the 200 or so who took communion choosing wine
over grape juice, we did commune at least three unbaptized people (my father
and my two grandsons), followed up with the Nunc Dimittis and all had a fine
time.  The sign of the cross was also made during the confession of faith
and the benediction.  I know we will never be evangelical, conservative,
orthodox, or traditional for those who are in the not-ignorant category.

And as long as I look at Christ, my people, and the UCC expressed by the
national church and most of our association, I feel good enough.

Then I am reminded how ignorant I am and await CUIC to suddenly become real
or the ELCA to wise up and open doors again.  You may well have the pleasure
of being something that drives me out of the UCC since you remind that I am
too ignorant, along with my people, the American people (but then who can we
evangelize too?), and the folks in Cleveland, Because no amount of
additional information can penetrate the darkness of UNAVOIDABLE IGNORANCE.

Which is why I have found nothing evangelical, nothing conservative, nothing
orthodox, nothing traditional, in the so-called &quot;ecot&quot; people.  But alas, as
unavoidable ignorant as I am, I guess I just missed it.

Amen.  Come Redeemer Jesus, come quickly.

You are AVOIDABLY ignorant of my point, which is that humanity (however
segmented existentially or rhetorically) is &quot;unavoidably ignorant&quot; in the
sense of inability to foresee foreign-policy-move consequences.  I'd hoped
that my chess analogy would warn readers away from misreading me, but I was
wrong.

1    The Peace Petition is &quot;elitist&quot; is presuming to KNOW that the
consequences of our remaining in Iraq would be worse than the consequences
of our withdrawing.  I'm humble enough to see that that knowledge-claim
exceeds the limits of the human condition.  When I spelled this out in my
June 25 &quot;On Faith,&quot; more than four score of folk denounced me: ironically,
as many &quot;knew&quot; that withdrawing would be better than &quot;knew&quot; remaining would
be better--a wash making my point for me!

2    I like the vigor of your responses &amp; said so 9.21 (below).  Please
reread what I was responding to &amp; see if my description of it as a
&quot;diatribe&quot; doesn't fit.  Then reread your 9.24 below &amp; see if the word
&quot;rant&quot; doesn't fit.

3    My &quot;over-priesting among the Lutherans&quot; was a reference to your
obedient acceptance of messages from the denominational over-priest, who had
virtual automatic access to your people through you.  I experienced the
contrast when (in '60) coming onto the national UCC staff from the CC side
(where pastors paid little attention to denominational messages), &amp;
experiencing E&amp;R folk (who were accustomed to paying much attention!).

Congratulations on your installation!  And on the design: just about my way
of proceeding.

At a time when we are reaping the whirlwind of Alan Greenspan's
professional blunders (endorsing Bush's tax cuts; failing to raise
interest rates in 2003-04 in the face of obvious signs of inflation),
Greenspan has the temerity to suggest the rest of us are too ignorant
to understand the world in all its complexity?  Let's just say I won't
be building my theology around that point of view.  But if we take
away the lesson that ALL of us-even Alan Greenspan-are fallible, then
perhaps we can proceed with the proper humility.

It's impossible to have a meaningful theological discussion of the
Iraq war (and thus of the UCC pastoral letter) without reference to
the specifics of the war.  As Christians, the starting point for an
inquiry into the war's specifics should be (IMO) the traditional &quot;just
war&quot; theory.  I don't dismiss pacifist objections to just war theory,
but I assume that any war that cannot pass muster under that theory
demands Christian opposition.

I don't want to wade into a debate over the merits of Augustine,
Aquinas, and later thinkers, so I'll confine myself to four generally
accepted components of just-war theory:  (1) proper authority; (2)
just cause; (3) reasonable likelihood of success; and (4)
proportionality.  I'm also confining my comments to the present
situation; I see no point in rehashing the reasons for my personal
opposition to the war back in 2002.

1. Proper authority

Some will say that past U.N. resolutions and the 2002 congressional
authorization were sufficient; others will disagree.  Let's leave this
prong aside.

2. Just cause

Our stated goals for the war were never clear.  If the goal was to
remove Saddam and his sons from power and/or to &quot;disarm&quot; them, that
goal has been achieved.  If the goal was to plant Jeffersonian
Democracy in Iraq, that goal is irretrievably lost; history will
decide whether it was a pipe dream, or a worthy objective waylaid by
incompetence, greed, or other factors.

In its hubris, the Bush Administration will not publicly acknowledge
its abandonment of the Big Idea, but its actions seem clearly aimed at
achieving a lesser goal.  (How does arming Sunni sheiks bring us
closer to liberal democracy??)  Bush's failure to articulate
objectives for the war is not only a political blunder; it also raises
serious questions about the war's moral legitimacy.

3. Reasonable likelihood of success

As noted above, there's zero chance of America planting a liberal
democracy in Iraq.  Without any other stated objective, it's
impossible to conclude that our efforts in Iraq have a reasonable
likelihood of success.

4. Proportionality

When all is said and done, it's likely that US/UN actions (two wars,
plus sanctions) will have caused the deaths of more Iraqis than Saddam
Hussein did.  Given the marginal good our interventions have done to
date, we should be highly skeptical of claims that a continuing U.S.
military presence is necessary to stave off even worse slaughter.

------------------------

OK, what does this tell us?  I think two points come to the fore.
First, the Christian presumption against war has been turned on its
head.  Christians must insist that those who wish to continue the war
bear the burden of persuasion.  Second, a war without stated
objectives cannot be a just war, because there is no way to evaluate
the justice of the cause or the likelihood of success.

My personal preference would have been for a pastoral letter that
spelled out these points and insisted that our national leaders
justify their demands for continuing war.  Aside from being
theologically sound, it would have avoided the perception of taking
sides in the ongoing political debate.  In light of the
Administration's total loss of credibility, however, I can sympathize
with the authors' decision simply to call for immediate withdrawal.

In closing, I have the utmost respect for the men and women who serve
in America's military.  I am not a pacifist, and so I believe it is an
honorable vocation for citizens in a democratic nation to serve in the
armed forces.  If anyone has blood on their hands, it is the rest of us
-for electing the buffoons in Congress and the White House who have
created the current mess.

Peace.

Matt:

1    Yes, in view of the fact that (as you say) &quot;all of us...are fallible,&quot;
we should &quot;proceed with the proper humility.&quot;  However, I was making a point
deeper than our fallibility: our species is infallibly IGNORANT of a future
in which the human will is involved.  Jesus says only the Father knows the
future, &amp; &quot;open theism&quot; denies that even the Father knows the future!  For
wisdom on the future, we're dependent on revelation &amp; on educated-informed
guesses--in contrast to less-informed, less-educated guesses.  (Alan
Greenspan is a genius-level eco-guesser, fallible both as a sinner &amp; from
imperfection of skills &amp; of knowledge.)
When &quot;natural science&quot; lost philosophy &amp; became &quot;physical science,&quot;
predictability was freed from will (divine &amp; human) &amp; thus became
commensurable--say, as a rock thrown on a rockpile in contrast to into a
pond.
But the Peace Petition &quot;knows&quot; we were wrong to go into Iraq &amp; &quot;knows&quot;
that we'd be right to withdraw.  That's two arrogances in one sentence.  I
like your suggestion that a Petition based on just-war theory would have
been better--both more theological &amp; more rational.

COMMENT ON &quot;JUST CAUSE&quot;:
The West's unspoken but steady Middle East CAUSE has been &amp; is the
prevention of despot-dominance as threatening oil-flow.  The USA, fearing
Iran, supported Iraq's preemptive war (Saddam!) against Iran.  When Iraq
(Saddam!) threatened to dominate the Middle East beginning with the taking
of Kuwait, we attacked  &amp; rescued Kuwait.  When Iraq (Saddam!) continued its
expansionist rhetoric &amp; ignored 23 UN resolutions aimed at its restraint, we
became (wrongly, it turned out) convinced that his reality was in sync with
his rhetoric--so we attacked again &amp; are suffering what before &quot;the
Movement&quot; we used to call the Little-Black-Sambo result.  Now, the
despot-dominance threat is once again Iran--this time, more serious than the
Iraq-expansionist threat, which was secular (the Baathist Party) &amp;
non-nuclear.  All the scenarios for eliminating this Iran threat are
ominous.

Now, Matt, two questions:

1    Given that the global economy would collapse if the Middle East's
oil-flow to the West were cut off or even severely reduced, is the West's
oil-flow CAUSE &quot;just&quot;?

2    If your answer to the first question is yes, do you agree that none of
the other three just-war tests is a determining impediment to the oil-flow
cause?  Leseee...
(1) &quot;Proper authority&quot;--as you imply, debatable.
(3) &quot;Reasonable likelihood of success&quot;--proved by our deposing the despot in
only a little over one month.
That despot was deposed both from his job &amp; as a potential threat to
oil-flow.
(4) &quot;Proportionality&quot;--the calculus was that the suffering caused by
deposing the despot would be less than the later suffering if the despot
were deposed after having grown more powerful.  Since there's no rational
time at which this judgment can be made, the stipulation is inoperative.
And the suffering to date is incomparably smaller than if (1) oil-flow to
the West were cut off or radically reduced, causing collapse of the world
economy, and/or (2) the Iranian despot were militarily deposed in future.

3    Cynics say &quot;It's all about oil.&quot;  We realists say &quot;It's mainly about
oil.&quot;  Utopians say &quot;It should be mainly about people.&quot;  What you call &quot;our
stated goals&quot; have avoided mention of the primary American goal of
Middle-East foreign-policy since we became dependent on the Middle-East use
of an American invention, oil-drilling.  Again I ask: Should our
UCC-Christian demand be for verbal honesty in both domestic-affairs  &amp;
foreign-affairs rhetoric?  If so, the churches should lead by repenting of
their own self-righteous utopian preachments in the public pulpit.

Grace and peace--
Willis

Your elliptical style can sometimes make it difficult to respond
systematically to your arguments, so I¹m going to do this as
straightforwardly as I can, taking your points as they occur:

1. We were wrong to go into Iraq. It¹s not arrogance to say that, it¹s
analysis. To suggest, as you seem to, that only YOU are using foundation of
moral analysis to consider the issue is to ignore the great deal of work
that¹s been done on the issue by a great many people, in the UCC and
elsewhere. We ³know² that the war in Iraq was wrong because we engaged in a
moral analysis. Is that moral analysis fallible? Sure, but no moreso than
when I ³know² that traveling through a green light is safe. It is a
knowledge borne of an understanding of the meaning of the signs and the
accumulated data of experience. Similarly, to ³know² that we are wrong to
withdraw is based upon an analysis of what our moral obligations are and
what the possibilities inherent in staying are. Can it be wrong? Sure, but
would be wrong in the exact same way. You seem to want to reduce ³knowledge²
to mathematical formulae, when in fact the practical basis upon which we
base most of our action is a form of ³knowledge² no more or less superior
than the knowledge that leads many of us to conclude that we should never
have gone into Iraq in the first place and that the least worst thing we can
do now is to get out. That doesn¹t mean that horrible things won¹t happen,
but it does mean that the likelihood of us forestalling those horrible
things is remote in the first place, and made worse by our continuing
presence. It¹s not just me saying this off my head. It¹s also been the
analysis of many Iraq experts, including Peter Galbraith, and the conclusion
of a number of intelligence agencies, both in the United States and abroad.

2. Furthermore, I will point out that a lot of this was known at the time by
the U.S. Intelligence and foreign policies agencies (though not by most
Americans), and it was IGNORED by a White House and a President who were the
PROPER targets of your use of the word arrogance, precisely because they not
only KNEW what the outcome would be (rose petals and chocolate, and
democracy flourishing in the Middle East), but they KNEW the outcome DESPITE
the weight of the evidence on the other side. That the UCC is now attempting
to correct that woeful act of arrogance by its own moral plea for a rational
foreign policy is a CORRECTIVE to arrogance, not an act of arrogance.

3. Let me add a further thought germane to your ³Iran threat² point. First
of all, when President Bush labels three countries an ³axis of evil² and
then goes ahead and invades one of them despite the disapproval of the
entire world (arrogance, again), it shouldn¹t be surprising to see the other
two do exactly what they¹ve done, namely to seek the one resource that is
demonstrably capable of fending off a U.S. Invasion, namely, the possession
of nuclear weapons. Neither Iran nor N. Korea had active nuclear programs in
advance of 2003. In fact, Clinton had negotiated a successful treaty with N.
Korea that put a stop to their nuclear program right up to the moment Bush
began rattling his saber. If we have an ³Iran threat² now, it¹s mostly of
our own making. I¹d suggest we¹ve got a much bigger ³Pakistan threat²
because they are much more sympathetic to Al Qaeda and already HAVE nuclear
weapons. Secondly, Ahmedinijad is not the boogie man many make him out to
be. His a creep and a bastard of the first degree, but he has ABSOLUTELY
ZERO control of the Iranian military and foreign policy. We¹d do much better
to ignore him, except that he makes such a convenient and willing figure of
satanic hatred, which is in both his and Bush¹s interests to continue to
fulminate.

4. You ask: ³Given that the global economy would collapse if the Middle
East's oil-flow to the West were cut off or even severely reduced, is the
West's oil-flow CAUSE &quot;just&quot;?² There is no moral analysis of the jus war
theory that I know of that allows one country to invade another simply out
of a) national interest, or b) the threat of eventual, possible,
hypothetical damage to it. Now, if you want to argue a political realist
position, and say that such wars need to be fought and that the national
interest is what state need to care about, morality be damned. Go ahead, but
don¹t pretend you¹re still within the bounds of the just war theory. I¹ve
been reading just war theorists from Augustine to Grotius to Walzer, and
none of them would endorse that reading of ³just cause,² though Metternich
or Richelieu might.

5. To address two of the points you made in the next section: You say that
we proved ³reasonable likelihood of success² by overthrowing Saddam in a
little over a month. But that was never the criterion of success. The
criterion of success was ³can we then install a friendly, democratic stable
regime in Iraq, which will govern independently without the need for
continuing major U.S. Presence.² This, after all, was the promise that was
being made by Wolfawitz, Rumsfeld, Cheney and Rice prior to the war. And if
THAT¹S the criterion for a reasonable likelihood of success, then it¹s an
abject failure (though Bush would have us stay there till the end of time on
the grounds that, at some indeterminate point in the future, it may in fact
happen). On the question of proportionality, this is tied to likelihood of
success. Because we lowballed the chances of failure, we highballed the
chances that the outcome would be proportional. However a) since Saddam did
NOT in fact pose a threat to us, ANY hostile response to him was
disproportional, except maybe for the continuation of sanctions to prevent
him from BECOMING  a threat, b) all of the major studies on Iraqi civilian
casualties caused by the war suggest that the cost of this boondoggle has
been GREATLY disproportional even to the expected threat of Iraq.

6. You end with the following paragraph:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Cynics say &quot;It's all about oil.&quot;  We realists say &quot;It's mainly about oil.&quot;
&gt; Utopians say &quot;It should be mainly about people.&quot;  What you call &quot;our stated

&gt; the churches should lead by repenting of their own self-righteous utopian
&gt; preachments in the public pulpit.
">

Whatever ³you realists² might say, it¹s not connected to any Christian
theological analysis of war that I¹m familiar with. Certainly it¹s not
consistent with a Niebuhrian CHRISTIAN realist position, which recognizes
the fallibility and limitedness of our own horizons, and the inevitability
of sin as a factor in all human social interactions, particularly in the
realm

Willis,

Rather than safeguarding the flow of oil from the Middle East to the
rest of the world, the current war has disrupted that flow.  (Last I
heard, Iraqi oil production still had not reached pre-war levels.)  If
military intervention was required to prevent Saddam from disrupting
the flow of oil, the pre-war status quo (no-fly zones, sanctions, et
al.) was adequate for that limited purpose.

Of course the Bush Administration's motivations were linked to petro-
politics, but their objective couldn't have been to prevent a
catastrophic disruption of the world's oil supply.  Perhaps the
Administration wanted to plant a pro-American regime in a country that
happens to be situated on top of the world's second-largest proven oil
reserves.  I trust we can agree that such an objective falls woefully
short of meeting the requirements of just-war theory.

Petro-politics were closer to the surface during the run-up to the
1991 Gulf War.  Saddam had nearly doubled his oil reserves by annexing
Kuwait, and seemed to have every intention of invading Saudi Arabia if
the U.N. (led by America) had not intervened.  I opposed that war at
the time, but in light of what we learned after the war about Saddam's
nuclear program, I wonder if I was wrong.  On the other hand, if we
had stayed out of the fray in 1990-91, then the OKC and 9/11 terrorist
attacks likely would never have happened.  How ignorant I am: even
with more than a decade of hindsight, I don't know the right answer!!

I still haven't reached the heart of your question: can access to a
key resource, such as oil, be a sufficient &quot;casus belli&quot; for purposes
of Christian just-war theory?  I'm afraid that our disagreements about
the underlying facts in the Middle East make this question a
theoretical one, and therefore impossible to answer with a simple
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;  I understand that the toll of a catastrophic
disruption of oil supplies would be measured not only in dollars, but
also in lives.  At the same time, I wonder how much of that loss would
really be due to the loss of access to oil, and how much would be due
to fundamental, structural injustices that are embedded in our
economy.  Certainly, no Christian worldview can accept waging war in a
faraway land to avoid confronting injustice at home.

The shorter, more practical answer to your question is &quot;no.&quot;  The 1991
Gulf War was as clear-cut a war for oil as we are likely to see, and I
opposed it.  I have second thoughts about my opposition, but only
because of factors not related to oil.  Therefore, it seems highly
unlikely that I would find any &quot;war for oil&quot; justified.

My answer to your first question makes your second question moot, but
I note that even if access to resources constituted a casus belli, the
test of proportionality would still need to be satisfied.  It's never
acceptable to perpetrate a greater evil abroad to prevent a lesser
evil at home.

Thanks for indulging my long-winded response.

Peace.

Matt

Now, Matt, two questions:

1    Given that the global economy would collapse if the Middle
East's

West's

2    If your answer to the first question is yes, do you agree that
none of

flow
cause?  Leseee...
(1) &quot;Proper authority&quot;--as you imply, debatable.
(3) &quot;Reasonable likelihood of success&quot;--proved by our deposing the
despot in
only a little over one month.
That despot was deposed both from his job &amp; as a potential threat to
oil-flow.
(4) &quot;Proportionality&quot;--the calculus was that the suffering caused by
deposing the despot would be less than the later suffering if the
despot
were deposed after having grown more powerful.  Since there's no
rational
time at which this judgment can be made, the stipulation is
inoperative.
And the suffering to date is incomparably smaller than if (1) oil-flow

Re: The theology of the Peace PetitionGlad you can take your kid to the
pediatrician, Scott.
Thanks for the competent, caring engagement of my post.
Our overlap of agreement is ca.80%, so I'll comment only on the 20%.
My enumeration corresponds to yours.

1    Yes, &quot;moral analysis&quot; was factored into the don't-go-in/let's-get-out
&quot;progressive&quot; (culture-&amp;-church) decisions.  And of course human beings must
not be perfectionist in input-demands for decision-making.  I respect both
the thinking-process &amp; the conclusions of the position you support, &amp; I
respectfully suggest that my counter-thinking &amp; counter-conclusions are also
worthy of respect even though they are contrarian to current liberal
opinion.  (I'm perplexed at your supposing that &quot;only&quot; I am &quot;using
foundation of moral analysis to consider the issue of&quot; Iraq: your thought
shocked me; I'm not a professional in ethics, &amp; it's normal for me to assume
my inferiority to some in moral analysis.)  /  Your &quot;a green [traffic] light
is safe&quot; is an analogy-overclaim for the conclusions of the &quot;moral analysis&quot;
to which you refer (viz., that of UCC et al.).  For predictions in which
human wills are factors, the traffic light is always amber: every corner
requires stopping to re-view/review/decide.  /  I want to reduce &quot;knowledge&quot;
(as I've used the word futurically) to zero, not (as you say I seem to) &quot;to
mathematical formulae.&quot;  All life-decisions, especially such a
world-historical decision as war, are based on more-or-less-informed
surmises, not on knowledge.  Whether we-the-USA should withdraw from Iraq is
a matter of comparative surmising.  Morally (in my opinion), it's a wash:
the sanctional force of the Christian religion is no more validly used for
yes than for no.  I'm not for staying in!  I'm not for getting out!  I'm too
ignorant to know what to do--except pray for the ignorant whom we elected to
make such decisions.  /  A factor: Last night, the president of Iran evaded
every Charlie-Rose question on the destiny of Israel.  One of the
prospective &quot;horrible things&quot; you mention.

2    You speak of the UCC Petition's &quot;moral plea for a rational foreign
policy.&quot;  I've been saying that for three generation's we've had a rational
Middle East policy, which is that oil-flow to the West is the priority.  Do
you think that any other priority would be politically viable ?  (Would &quot;we
the people&quot; be willing to sacrifice oil-flow for some higher-nobler value?)
I have a keen memory of Hitler's belief that the American peace-movement
would keep us out of WW2 until too late, i.e. until he'd taken Britain.
Those pacifists I was arguing against even before Hitler came to power had a
nobler goal that contributed to an eviler end.  I fear utopians!

3    As you know, you're hyperbolic in claiming that the preemptive strike
on Iraq had &quot;the disapproval of the entire world.&quot;  The coalition was of
eight nations.  /  Yes, Bush's saber-rattling was counter-productive.  /
Ahmedinijad was at great pains to deny (to Charlie Rose) that he wants Iran
to dominate the Middle East, &amp; doubtless he'll be spelling out that
disavowal at U.Columbia.  Do you believe him?  Do you think his oft-stated
threat to destroy Israel is only a strutting for domestic consumption, &amp; not
also as meat thrown to the Islamist dogs of war?  And do you think America
would not be deeply involved if our ally, Israel, were to engage in a
preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities? (The Israeli military,
the world's best, has an excellent record of preemptive strikes, including
the '81 elimination of Iraq's attempt at a nuclear facility.) I agree with
you that W. &amp; A. are counter-Satans in the political rhetoric of their
respective countries.  But you seem to make light of the threat, &amp; that
because you seem to make light of the oil-flow centrifuge of West / Middle
East politics.

4    Like you, I know of &quot;no moral analysis of the just war theory...that
allows one country to invade another simply out of a) national interest, or
b) the threat of eventual, possible hypothetical damage to it.&quot;
You do know that in '67, with armies of four nations on its borders, Israel
preemptively struck all four (beginning with the elimination of the Egyptian
air force) &amp; maintained the initiative until all four nations were defeated.
Greatly outnumbered, Israel probably would have suffered death as your
&quot;hypothetical damage&quot; if the surrounding armies had the initiative.
Question, Scott: Was the Israeli preemptive strike JUSTified even though in
violation of JUST-war doctrine?  Or should Israel's &quot;national interest&quot; in
surviving have taken second place to maintaining the high moral ground of no
preemptive warring?  /  Too, you are unfair in judging narrowly that our
preemptive strike in Iraq was national only: (1) It was eight nations, not
just ours; (2) It was, in oil-flow terms, the West, not just the U.S.; (3)
The &quot;hypothetical damage&quot; was not just to us but to the West &amp; (in light of
the global economy's dependence on Middle East oil-flow) the world.  /  I
supported the suggestion that the UCC Petition would have been better both
theologically &amp; rationally had it been on the spine of just-war doctrine,
but I think the latter is of limited value in the new world we all face.

5    You claim that deposing Saddam &quot;was never the criterion of success.&quot;
You are wrong in light of the underlying-unspoken oil-flow U.S. foreign
policy, though of course you are right in terms of the U.S. rhetoric (as it
were) floating atop the oil.  /  Again, on &quot;proportionality,&quot; my scenarioing
projects the suffering three stages into the future, in which case the
suffering is vastly greater than that at the present time.  (Herman Kahn,
founder of the Hudson Institute, was responsible for carrying &quot;scenario&quot;
outside the theater &amp; applying it to the &quot;theater&quot; of
politics/economics/culture.  I learned scenarioing from him when I was his
religion scenarioer; scenario &quot;staging&quot; [again, out of the drama-theater!]
is an important aspect.)  /  Iraq as &quot;a [i.e., one] people&quot; was an invention
of one Englishman (Churchill), &amp; &quot;Iraq&quot; may be incapable of evolving a
non-tyrant government: I think it should be three intra-democratic states
with Baghdad as its center for essential inter-state functions.  Saddam's
dream was of Middle-East dominance, though he was farther from it than we
thought--but he might have become, again, a despot-threat to the Middle East
if we had not deposed him.  Much iffyness!  And, I say again, universal
human ignorance of the future &amp; of our present decisional influences on it.

6    &quot;Nothing should ever be tried for the first time&quot; is an old British
bromide I remember from my childhood.  To my knowledge (!) you are correct
in saying that my &quot;realist&quot; position &quot;is not connected to any Christian
theological analysis of war I'm familiar with.&quot;  (War has taken on new forms
&amp; dimensions, &amp; theology has some catching up to do.)  /  I must protest
your &quot;Certainly [!]&quot; my position &quot;is not consistent with a CHRISTIAN
Niebuhrian realist position, which recognizes the fallibility and
limitedness of our own horizons, and the inevitability of sin as a factor in
all human social interactions, particularly in the realm of politics.&quot;  A
startling statement, Scott!  To capsule RN in two words, we are finite (as
in my assertion of our essential IGNORANCE of any future involving human
wills) &amp; sinful (as in my denial that we ever &quot;know&quot; free of self-interest &amp;
self-righteousness).  /  I do not say that &quot;it SHOULD be 'mainly about
oil'&quot;; I assert that it IS.  &quot;Should&quot; is moral/moralistic: &quot;is&quot; is
existential-realistic.  /  Here's where &quot;should&quot; should come in:
we-the-West, we-Americans, should, in the process of aiming to assure a
steady flow of oil to us, do as little harm &amp; as much good as we can manage
to all people involved.  /  How about we as CHRISTIANS?  You put it this
way: &quot;For states and governments, it's MOSTLY about self-interest, and
therefore in this case it's MOSTLY about oil.  But for Christians, it's
ALWAYS as a matter of discipleship MOSTLY about people, and therefore we
have an obligation as the church to remind the State that it's never ALL
about oil, but in fact in the end, MOSTLY about people.&quot;  I like the way you
put it, &amp; wonder how the rewrite of the UCC Petition would look were your
statement used as a template for the rewrite.  I'm serious: how about your
taking a crack at it--beginning with the realistic affirmation that it's at
least somewhat about oil?  How refreshing it would be for a liberal church
to say something positive--publicly!--about oil-flow as a necessary element
in the West's facing of the Middle East!  /  Of course it's &quot;MOSTLY about
people,&quot; especially in Christian perspective: given the exponential demand
for oil (China, India), my guess is that we have only a quarter century to
go before we're out of commercially available oil, &amp; our species will
probably last somewhat longer (so we'd better go 24/7 toward alternative
sources of energy).  /  Amen to your (properly!) eschatological sentence!

Grace and peace--

&gt; Willis,

&gt; Rather than safeguarding the flow of oil from the Middle East to the
&gt; rest of the world, the current war has disrupted that flow.  (Last I
&gt; heard, Iraqi oil production still had not reached pre-war levels.)  If
&gt; military intervention was required to prevent Saddam from disrupting
&gt; the flow of oil, the pre-war status quo (no-fly zones, sanctions, et
&gt; al.) was adequate for that limited purpose.

&gt; Of course the Bush Administration's motivations were linked to petro-
&gt; politics, but their objective couldn't have been to prevent a
&gt; catastrophic disruption of the world's oil supply.  Perhaps the
&gt; Administration wanted to plant a pro-American regime in a country that
&gt; happens to be situated on top of the world's second-largest proven oil
&gt; reserves.  I trust we can agree that such an objective falls woefully
&gt; short of meeting the requirements of just-war theory.

&gt; Petro-politics were closer to the surface during the run-up to the
&gt; 1991 Gulf War.  Saddam had nearly doubled his oil reserves by annexing
&gt; Kuwait, and seemed to have every intention of invading Saudi Arabia if
&gt; the U.N. (led by America) had not intervened.  I opposed that war at
&gt; the time, but in light of what we learned after the war about Saddam's
&gt; nuclear program, I wonder if I was wrong.  On the other hand, if we
&gt; had stayed out of the fray in 1990-91, then the OKC and 9/11 terrorist
&gt; attacks likely would never have happened.  How ignorant I am: even
&gt; with more than a decade of hindsight, I don't know the right answer!!

&gt; I still haven't reached the heart of your question: can access to a
&gt; key resource, such as oil, be a sufficient &quot;casus belli&quot; for purposes
&gt; of Christian just-war theory?  I'm afraid that our disagreements about
&gt; the underlying facts in the Middle East make this question a
&gt; theoretical one, and therefore impossible to answer with a simple
&gt; &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;  I understand that the toll of a catastrophic
&gt; disruption of oil supplies would be measured not only in dollars, but
&gt; also in lives.  At the same time, I wonder how much of that loss would
&gt; really be due to the loss of access to oil, and how much would be due
&gt; to fundamental, structural injustices that are embedded in our
&gt; economy.  Certainly, no Christian worldview can accept waging war in a
&gt; faraway land to avoid confronting injustice at home.

&gt; The shorter, more practical answer to your question is &quot;no.&quot;  The 1991
&gt; Gulf War was as clear-cut a war for oil as we are likely to see, and I
&gt; opposed it.  I have second thoughts about my opposition, but only
&gt; because of factors not related to oil.  Therefore, it seems highly
&gt; unlikely that I would find any &quot;war for oil&quot; justified.

&gt; My answer to your first question makes your second question moot, but
&gt; I note that even if access to resources constituted a casus belli, the
&gt; test of proportionality would still need to be satisfied.  It's never
&gt; acceptable to perpetrate a greater evil abroad to prevent a lesser
&gt; evil at home.

&gt; Thanks for indulging my long-winded response.

&gt; Peace.

&gt; Matt

&gt; ------------------------

&gt;    Now, Matt, two questions:

&gt; 1    Given that the global economy would collapse if the Middle
&gt; East's
&gt; oil-flow to the West were cut off or even severely reduced, is the
&gt; West's
&gt; oil-flow CAUSE &quot;just&quot;?

&gt; 2    If your answer to the first question is yes, do you agree that
&gt; none of
&gt; the other three just-war tests is a determining impediment to the oil-
&gt; flow
&gt; cause?  Leseee...
&gt; (1) &quot;Proper authority&quot;--as you imply, debatable.
&gt; (3) &quot;Reasonable likelihood of success&quot;--proved by our deposing the
&gt; despot in
&gt; only a little over one month.
&gt; That despot was deposed both from his job &amp; as a potential threat to
&gt; oil-flow.
&gt; (4) &quot;Proportionality&quot;--the calculus was that the suffering caused by
&gt; deposing the despot would be less than the later suffering if the
&gt; despot
&gt; were deposed after having grown more powerful.  Since there's no
&gt; rational
&gt; time at which this judgment can be made, the stipulation is
&gt; inoperative.
&gt; And the suffering to date is incomparably smaller than if (1) oil-flow
&gt; to
&gt; the West were cut off or radically reduced, causing collapse of the
&gt; world
&gt; economy, and/or (2) the Iranian despot were militarily deposed in
&gt; future.

Willis:

This is a board whose stated purpose is &quot;Confessing Christ&quot;.  So I
have to ask you how does your inference that the oil-flow cause meets
number one in the just-war cause criteria fit into your theology of
Christ and what it means to &quot;Confess Christ&quot;.

First, let me say that the loss of Iraq's oil (which we are dealing
with anyway) had been being dealt with by the world's economy for over
a decade before the invasion.  There were sanctions against Iraq
trading it's oil, and it was only able to do so in relatively small
quanties compared to the rest of the world's oil production. Loss of
their oil production would certainly have an effect, but not trigger a
total collapse of the world's economy.  In 2004 it was number 14 on
the list of worldwide producers and 11 on the list of exporters
(versus Saudia Arabia as number 1, Russia as number 2 and the USA as
number three on the list of producers of oil). We currently import the
biggest percentage (25%) of our oil (1,839,000 barrels per day out of
7,139,000) from Canada.  75% of US oil imports are from countries
outside the Mid East. The argument that the war could be justified
under the possibility of the world economy collasping if we lost the
Mid-East oil supply (including Saudia Arabia which is our second
biggest source of imported oil) does not appear to be supported by
these facts alone - never mind what could happen with conservation and
innovations if there was a drastic drop in production.

But even if it did &quot;cause the world's economies to collapse&quot;, I have
yet to see the part where Jesus says you are to love your enemy unless
the world economy is affected, and then war is justified.  If Christ
came to save the world, is it the world that we have fashioned that is
fallen, polluted and with an inordinately unbalanced distribution of
resources by making it more of what we've done just better?  Or is it
to restore the world to God's good creation?  My understanding of both
the just war theory and of God's purpose and intention for all of
Creation in sending us Christ was not to stablilize economies, no
matter how noble it is dressed up in concerns about how it would
affect the poor and hungry in the world, or to protect an oil-flow
from certain countries into others because it will throw ecomonies
into recession or depressions.  The intentional loss of life, taken in
a violent action and invasion of another country with casualites that
were easily predicted by the most ignorant of us in the terms of
foreign policy or future knowledge, to protect the oil flow hardly
rises to the level of meeting the first standard of just war theory
and run counter to my understanding of what it means to follow as a
disciple of Jesus, Savior of the World.  And I would contend that if
one who Confesses Christ argues that protecting the world oil flow is
in line with Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, then one has
seriously misunderstood both God's purpose and work through the Risen
One.  I'm am unware beyond the so called prosperity gospel of any
orthodox, neo-orthodox or reformed, or progressive theology that would
ague that the world oil-flow or similar reasons are reasons to enter
into a war that God would look down and say &quot;yes, that was just.&quot;

The theology of pastoral letter and petition has multiple faults in my
opinion - but that hardly means that the war itself can be justified
theologically.  Just that these two pieces could have done a better
job of pointing out the flaws and sins of having undertaken this
action, and then continuing to ignore the reality on the ground and
take appropriate corrective (dare I say redemptive?) action.

God's grace and peace,

&gt; became (wrongly, it turned out) convinced that his reality was in sync with
&gt; his rhetoric--so we attacked again &amp; are suffering what before &quot;the
&gt; Movement&quot; we used to call the Little-Black-Sambo result.  Now, the
&gt; despot-dominance threat is once again Iran--this time, more serious than the
&gt; Iraq-expansionist threat, which was secular (the Baathist Party) &amp;
&gt; non-nuclear.  All the scenarios for eliminating this Iran threat are
&gt; ominous.

&gt;     Now, Matt, two questions:

&gt; stated goals&quot; have avoided mention of the primary American goal of
&gt; Middle-East foreign-policy since we became dependent on the Middle-East use
&gt; of an American invention, oil-drilling.  Again I ask: Should our

&gt; Subject: Re: &quot;Ignorant,&quot; not underl-informed; &amp; the theology of the Peace

&gt; Petition

&gt; &gt; At a time when we are reaping the whirlwind of Alan Greenspan's
&gt; &gt; professional blunders (endorsing Bush's tax cuts; failing to raise
&gt; &gt; interest rates in 2003-04 in the face of obvious signs of inflation),
&gt; &gt; Greenspan has the temerity to suggest the rest of us are too ignorant
&gt; &gt; to understand the world in all its complexity?  Let's just say I won't
&gt; &gt; be building my theology around that point of view.  But if we take
&gt; &gt; away the lesson that ALL of us-even Alan Greenspan-are fallible, then
&gt; &gt; perhaps we can proceed with the proper humility.

&gt; &gt; It's impossible to have a meaningful theological discussion of the
&gt; &gt; Iraq war (and thus of the UCC pastoral letter) without reference to
&gt; &gt; the specifics of the war.  As Christians, the starting point for an
&gt; &gt; inquiry into the war's specifics should be (IMO) the traditional &quot;just
&gt; &gt; war&quot; theory.  I don't dismiss pacifist objections to just war theory,
&gt; &gt; but I assume that any war that cannot pass muster under that theory
&gt; &gt; demands Christian opposition.

&gt; &gt; I don't want to wade into a debate over the merits of Augustine,
&gt; &gt; Aquinas, and later thinkers, so I'll confine myself to four generally
&gt; &gt; accepted components of just-war theory:  (1) proper authority; (2)
&gt; &gt; just cause; (3) reasonable likelihood of success; and (4)
&gt; &gt; proportionality.  I'm also confining my comments to the present
&gt; &gt; situation; I see no point in rehashing the reasons for my personal
&gt; &gt; opposition to the war back in 2002.

&gt; &gt; 1. Proper authority

&gt; &gt; Some will say that past U.N. resolutions and the 2002 congressional
&gt; &gt; authorization were sufficient; others will disagree.  Let's leave this
&gt; &gt; prong aside.

&gt; &gt; 2. Just cause

&gt; &gt; Our stated goals for the war were never clear.  If the goal was to
&gt; &gt; remove Saddam and his sons from power and/or to &quot;disarm&quot; them, that
&gt; &gt; goal has been achieved.  If the goal was to plant Jeffersonian
&gt; &gt; Democracy in Iraq, that goal is irretrievably lost; history will
&gt; &gt; decide whether it was a pipe dream, or a worthy objective waylaid by

Deb (&amp; Matt):

1    Thanks, Deb, for the &quot;CC&quot; reminder &amp; for the oil-data.  (On the latter,
Wm.Faulkner sardonically remarked that facts are almost as important as
truth.)  (In your text, I've numbered your paragraphs.)

2    Please note that my post (to which the below is your response) was on
the &quot;Subject&quot; of &quot;The theology of....&quot;  As a biblical theologian, I'm
concerned (in the words of the UCC Statement of Faith, written during &quot;the
acts of God&quot; period) to &quot;testify&quot; to God's &quot;deeds&quot; yesterday &amp; today, in
light of Jesus Christ &quot;the same yesterday, today, &amp; forever.&quot;  I've
challenged this UCC Open Forum to offer theological critiques of the UCC
Petition, &amp; suggested to Scott that he use his statement as a template for
this.  This challenge seems to me to be at the heart of CC's mission.

3    My Sec.1 to Matt yesterday (here, below your post) is precisely
theological.  It deals with six of the traditional theological topoi.  And
in speaking of the &quot;two arrogances,&quot; it implicitly condemns the reduction of
theology to ethics (or the absorption of theology into ethics).  At
NYTSeminary, I had a flood of students passionate about some ethical issue
which they assumed religion might add theological clout to.  Fred.Streng
called it &quot;the eighth way of being religious.&quot;  In the UCC Petition, I sniff
some of the stench of that perversion.

4    Still in your first paragraph, you &quot;infer&quot; that I claim that the
oil-flow cause &quot;meets number one in the just-war cause criteria.&quot;  As Matt &amp;
I discussed it (again, below), No.1 is &quot;proper authority.&quot;  He &amp; I put this
in the &quot;disputed questions&quot; category, as &quot;debatable&quot;: you think
otherwise--or is your No.1 some other criterion?

5    As for your second paragraph, I agree with your data &amp; disagree with
your conclusion (in the last sentence).  The world's economy is now so
jittery &amp; fragile (as witness the world-effects of the Fed's action last
week) that it wouldn't take much to collapse it.  But here again,
&quot;debatable&quot;: your scenarioing considers the world economy less fragile.  Our
difference here makes my point that we humans are, by nature-in-creation,
necessarily IGNORANT of the future.  And the confession of this basic
ignorance is implicit in Christian anthropology: the confession is itself a
celebration of our creatureliness-under-the-Creator.

6    Your third paragraph introduces disciple enemy-love, an instruction
unique to Master Jesus.  As you may know, a question Gospel scholars long
have debated but largely agree on is the distribution of the logia into
three categories of &quot;what Jesus said&quot; canonically (i.e., taking all the
sayings as authentic, rather than reducing them down--as the Jesus Seminar
did--to ca.30%): (1) to his disciples, (2) to his wider following, (3) to
&quot;the crowds&quot; (i.e., humanity).  As my phrase &quot;disciple enemy-love&quot; shows,
enemy-love is in the first category.  In this category, not to worry if the
instruction is impossible!  Jesus, to his disciples, was not a
possibility-thinker (like that glass-cathedral guy).
Now, Deb, what sense can be made from your throwing enemy-love into the
calculus of U.S. foreign policy?  Is your placement not an instance of &quot;the
fallacy of the misplaced category&quot;?  Though the so-called Dominators would
like it to be so, the U.S. &amp; the church are separate realities.  Luther's
&quot;two realms&quot; was overdone by the so-called German Christians under Hitler,
but I think you here underdo the separation &amp; (implicitly) unjustly
criticize public-office Christians who do not have all of the freedoms
private-citizen Christians have.  (E.g., W. is not free from the direct
power-calculus of the Middle East's two prime exports, viz. oil &amp;
religion-central terrorism.  So far, I've mentioned only the first export;
the second weighs more heavily on W.'s decision-making scale.)
Evidence that enemy-love is a disciples-only dominical instruction?  For
one thing, it's accompanying command of defenseless non-retaliation.  It's
one feature of his extreme rigorism, extreme discipline of his small
against-the-world disciple-band.
But let's use the blood-plasma analogy: the more reduced to its essence,
the more useful is the &quot;blood.&quot;  In our Lord's enemy-love instruction, the
essence is universal benevolence: How can we, in every situation &amp; in
relation to all our fellow-humanbeings, act in evidence of the &quot;good will&quot;
we are called to?  Kant renders this as his &quot;categorical imperative,&quot; now
useful in confronting the West with the bio-impossibility of universalizing
its physical prosperity.  Here, you express it as to &quot;restore the world&quot;
(Hebrew &quot;tikkun,&quot; the title of an excellent journal).  Of course the
Incarnation was not (in your words) &quot;to stabilize economies&quot; or &quot;to
protect...oil-flow&quot;!
The rest of your paragraph is, as I see it, a muddle of obligations of
human/citizen/governor/Christian, your criterion of all these concentric
circles being your &quot;understanding of what it means to follow as a disciple
(sic) of Jesus.&quot;  Your muddle leads you into a judgmental tone unworthy of
you.  I hope you can see it in your claim that the war has produced
&quot;casualties that were easily predicted by the most ignorant [!] of us....&quot;
Pentagon planners now agree that increasing the salaries of the Iraqi
military (instead of disbanding the military, sending 400,000 men home with
no income to support their families!) would have almost eliminated further
casualties after the toppling of Saddam.  Your paragraph closes with a
reference to God as operating within just-war doctrine: not even I think
within the limits of just-war doctrine!

7    Yes to your fourth paragraph, except your assumption that the war
cannot be &quot;justified theologically.&quot;  Whether it can or not is precisely the
theological question I have asked us in this CC Open Forum to consider in
doing &quot;the theology of the Peace Petition.&quot;

Grace and peace--

Subject: Re: The theology of the Peace Petition

&gt; Willis:

&gt;1     This is a board whose stated purpose is &quot;Confessing Christ&quot;.  So I
&gt; have to ask you how does your inference that the oil-flow cause meets
&gt; number one in the just-war cause criteria fit into your theology of
&gt; Christ and what it means to &quot;Confess Christ&quot;.

&gt;2     First, let me say that the loss of Iraq's oil (which we are dealing
&gt; with anyway) had been being dealt with by the world's economy for over
&gt; a decade before the invasion.  There were sanctions against Iraq
&gt; trading it's oil, and it was only able to do so in relatively small
&gt; quanties compared to the rest of the world's oil production. Loss of
&gt; their oil production would certainly have an effect, but not trigger a
&gt; total collapse of the world's economy.  In 2004 it was number 14 on
&gt; the list of worldwide producers and 11 on the list of exporters
&gt; (versus Saudia Arabia as number 1, Russia as number 2 and the USA as
&gt; number three on the list of producers of oil). We currently import the
&gt; biggest percentage (25%) of our oil (1,839,000 barrels per day out of
&gt; 7,139,000) from Canada.  75% of US oil imports are from countries
&gt; outside the Mid East. The argument that the war could be justified
&gt; under the possibility of the world economy collasping if we lost the
&gt; Mid-East oil supply (including Saudia Arabia which is our second
&gt; biggest source of imported oil) does not appear to be supported by
&gt; these facts alone - never mind what could happen with conservation and
&gt; innovations if there was a drastic drop in production.

&gt; 3    But even if it did &quot;cause the world's economies to collapse&quot;, I have
&gt; yet to see the part where Jesus says you are to love your enemy unless
&gt; the world economy is affected, and then war is justified.  If Christ
&gt; came to save the world, is it the world that we have fashioned that is
&gt; fallen, polluted and with an inordinately unbalanced distribution of
&gt; resources by making it more of what we've done just better?  Or is it
&gt; to restore the world to God's good creation?  My understanding of both
&gt; the just war theory and of God's purpose and intention for all of
&gt; Creation in sending us Christ was not to stablilize economies, no
&gt; matter how noble it is dressed up in concerns about how it would
&gt; affect the poor and hungry in the world, or to protect an oil-flow
&gt; from certain countries into others because it will throw ecomonies
&gt; into recession or depressions.  The intentional loss of life, taken in
&gt; a violent action and invasion of another country with casualites that
&gt; were easily predicted by the most ignorant of us in the terms of
&gt; foreign policy or future knowledge, to protect the oil flow hardly
&gt; rises to the level of meeting the first standard of just war theory
&gt; and run counter to my understanding of what it means to follow as a
&gt; disciple of Jesus, Savior of the World.  And I would contend that if
&gt; one who Confesses Christ argues that protecting the world oil flow is
&gt; in line with Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, then one has
&gt; seriously misunderstood both God's purpose and work through the Risen
&gt; One.  I'm am unware beyond the so called prosperity gospel of any
&gt; orthodox, neo-orthodox or reformed, or progressive theology that would
&gt; ague that the world oil-flow or similar reasons are reasons to enter
&gt; into a war that God would look down and say &quot;yes, that was just.&quot;

&gt;4     The theology of pastoral letter and petition has multiple faults in
&gt;my
&gt; opinion - but that hardly means that the war itself can be justified
&gt; theologically.  Just that these two pieces could have done a better
&gt; job of pointing out the flaws and sins of having undertaken this
&gt; action, and then continuing to ignore the reality on the ground and
&gt; take appropriate corrective (dare I say redemptive?)

Willis,

I reproduced your discussion of enemy-love (item 6 in your last post)
below.

How do you reconcile your views with Jesus's rejection of worldly
power in the desert (esp. Lk 4, where Satan is identified as the
source of worldly power), and His admonition about the sword (Mt
26:52)?

Also, what's your best guess re: the nature of Jesus's temptation at
Gethsemane??  Martin Scorsese (&quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;)
thought Jesus's temptation was the desire to be an ordinary, mortal
man.  J.H. Yoder offered a more plausible (IMO) interpretation.  Yoder
maintained that Jesus's greatest temptation was the crusade-- the
desire to fulfill the prayer &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot; through violence (and
avoid crucifixion in the bargain, of course).

You don't have to be a pacifist (as Yoder was) to accept this
interpretation.  I haven't read Niebuhr, but as I understand it, he
argues that violence, and even war, are necessary concessions to a
fallen world.  That view certainly qualifies Jesus's teachings on
violence, but it doesn't limit their application to disciples only.

As I'm sure you can tell, I'm inclined to disagree with you, but I'd
like to understand your position better, while doing my best to keep
an open mind.

Thanks for the dialogue, and for indulging my ignorance.

Peace.

Matt

------------------------------

Your third paragraph introduces disciple enemy-love, an instruction
unique to Master Jesus.  As you may know, a question Gospel scholars
long
have debated but largely agree on is the distribution of the logia
into
three categories of &quot;what Jesus said&quot; canonically (i.e., taking all
the
sayings as authentic, rather than reducing them down--as the Jesus
Seminar
did--to ca.30%): (1) to his disciples, (2) to his wider following, (3)
to
&quot;the crowds&quot; (i.e., humanity).  As my phrase &quot;disciple enemy-love&quot;
shows,
enemy-love is in the first category.  In this category, not to worry

Matt:

Thank you for hanging in with this biblical-theological discussion.
I've numbered your text to correspond with my responses.

1    Our Lord's &quot;rejection of worldly power&quot; was not philosophical but
VOCATIONAL, as was his rejection of violence (except for the one instance of
prophetic-symbolic violence, in the temple).  The Incarnate's
job-description--vocation, &quot;calling&quot; from God--included the two rejections.
The early Christians well understood that the two rejections were
provisional-occasional-temporary: when the Lord's Prayer is answered with
Kingdom-Come, King Jesus (celebrated atop the UCC symbol) will supersede, by
heavenly &amp; worldly means, the lesser kings.  &quot;Empire&quot; is the usual term for
this, one king superseding a number of kings.  So, &quot;Kyrios Kaisar&quot; is the
Roman Emperor &amp; &quot;Kyrios Iesous&quot; is the Christian-&amp;-universal Emperor.  To
become a Muslim, one must say aloud thrice &quot;There is no God but God, &amp;
Muhammad is his prophet.&quot;  To become a Christian, one had to say aloud once
&quot;Jesus is Lord [i.e., Emperor].&quot;  (Jesus models for us all the discovery &amp;
fulfillment of our particular vocation/calling/mission.)

2    Jesus had a dirty job to do, &amp; it revulsed him: he knew that it
included his death.  Scorsese &amp; Yoder, each putting on Jesus the spin
appropriate to humanism (in S.'s case) &amp; pacifism (in Y.'s case), make me
smile, then scowl: two instances of Jesus-abuse.  (It is not Jesus-abuse to
spread out possibilities of what was going on in Jesus' heart &amp; mind:
landing on &amp; mentioning only one possibility is propaganda, the abuse of
Jesus to promote your thing.)  STORY:  In a group today, I pointed to
J.Rizer (&quot;J&quot; stands for nothing more), who had crawled up the Monte Cassino
mountain to pick up land-mines with his bare hands.  The Germans had killed
almost all of the Americans attempting to remove this barrier to their march
on Rome.  I've no doubt that J. was as sure he would die as Jesus was that
he would die.  I asked the group, why did J. volunteer?  Immediately his
wife said, &quot;Because he believed that if he didn't volunteer, one of his
friends would die.&quot;  Jim just sat there, head bowed.  After the session, his
wife came to me &amp; said, &quot;Every annual reunion of that Army unit after the
war, Jim &amp; I [Margaret] were treated like a king &amp; queen.&quot;  (I was reminding
the group that Ken Burn's 14 l/2 hour PBS &quot;The War&quot; is on these evenings, &amp;
last night the segment included the battle for Monte Cassino.)

3    As I said earlier today to Deb &amp; you, Jesus invited his hearers to
participate in his vocation-mission (&amp; chose &quot;The Twelve&quot; for radical
participation).  The &quot;disciples&quot; were trainees for &quot;apostleship,&quot; literally
&quot;sent-out-ness&quot; to spread the vocation-mission before &amp; after the
Resurrection, the violent defeat of death by the power of the living God.
When the Christians' neighbors, seeing their moral superiority to pagans,
asked them to assume political offices, &amp; the Christians came to include
politics within the sphere of their Christian duties, the vocation-mission
had to be PESHERED (re-conceived) to include coercion/violence: force is an
essential dimension in public governance.  A common hermeneutical error--the
heart of &quot;Christian pacifism&quot;--is to quote Jesus against the peshered
vocation-mission.  This anachronism fails to face that fact that Jesus was
(as he does NOT want US to be) politically irresponsible, nonresponsible,
having no political power &amp; thus no attendant political responsibilities.
Unlike Muhammad, Jesus had nothing to do with force (the hand-end of the
sword); he did experience, in his side, the front end.  As I put it, in
pointing to a radical distinction between Islam &amp; Christianity, &quot;Muhammad
killed, Jesus was killed.&quot;  The oft-told story of Niebuhr's conversion from
pacifism would be well worth your attention.

4    AMEN to your continuing to try to understand a position you're
&quot;inclined to disagree with&quot;!  From limiting one's reading to what one agrees
with, one learns NOTHING!

Grace and peace--
Willis
