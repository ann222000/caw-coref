Anyone who has seen the animated movie " Pocahontas" will recall how
politically correct the encounter between the English and Indians was
portrayed. Rather than exploring the encounter of two mutually
uncomprehending cultures, the writers depicted the Indians as noble
savages and the English (with the exception of John Smith) as arrogant,
violent buffoons. If there was anything remotely virtuous about the
founding of the first permanent, English-speaking colony in the New
World, it couldn't be found here.

Now comes New Line Cinema with a real-actor version of the
Pocahontas-John Smith story: " The New World ." And Virginia Indians
aren't happy about it. In a press release floated on PR Newswire (it's
not clear who released it), Karenne Wood (Monacan), chair of theVirginia
Council on Indians and a PhD candidate in anthropology at the University
of Virginia, complained that the movie reproduced the discredited story
about the young Pocahontas saving Smith from execution by throwing her
body across him. Over and above that flaw, Wood said, "Our women appear
as either princesses or squaws, and our men are either noble or
warlike."

The press release continues: "Particularly offensive to Virginia
Indian women is the characterization of Pocahontas as the object of
Smith's physical desire, even though she was only 11 or 12 when they
met, and Smith was closer to 30. The role is played by a 14-year-old
actress."

As a backdrop to the criticism, Virginia's Indians are frustrated,
too, by the way the film is tied to the promotion of the 400th
anniversary of Jamestown's founding, while they have yet received the
federal status enjoyed by some 567 other Indian tribes.

I haven't seen the movie yet, so I can't comment -- other than to
say, " The New World " can't possibly be worse than " Pocahontas"....
Can it?

Two great books on how Indian and Western Cultures meet and mutually
incomprehensible are by T.R. Fehernbach. One is 'Comanches, Death of a
Nation' and the other is 'Fire and Blood, History of Mexico'. Really
eye-opening, super scholarship.

Also, shows how only one Culture can exist at a time-space. How
Culture 'commands'.

The Federal Recognition for Virginia tribes comes with very
unfortunate PC racism for folks that have been assimilated Virginians
for 300 years.

Movies aren't accurate reflections of reality. Te expect this
particular movie to be seems unreasonable, in my opinion.

The headline "Hollywood Historically Accurate!" would be newsworthy;
but mangling history is the industry's modus operandi .

In the filmmakers defense, anyone with a child can testify that -on
the threat of a toy being discarded, even an unused toy or a toy the kid
didn't know existed-their instinct is to fling themselves bodily upon
it, protecting the toy as if it's the last and most cherished item in
the world.

Five minutes later they'll forget the incident. It makes the
child-Pocahontas-saves-Smith believable to a parent.

Seriously (the above is tongue in cheek) why is anyone disturbed over
what people -and we-have accepted for decades?

James Young says Shenandoah " captures both the natural beauty of the
Commonwealth as well as the character of her people "; Dave Juday bought
into the movie's version of the Valley's settlers; Rick Sincere says
it's the best movie set in Virginia; etc. More recently on the
Rebellion, JAB said it was a great movie, and another commenter 'loved'
both the movie and the stage version.

OK, it's skewering a lot of good folks; but a point is made.
Shenandoah is apparently good entertainment, a good story; but it has
nothing to do with the Valley, Virginia, or The War. Nothing.

Not the location, the scenery, the places, the characters, accents,
religion, dialogue, plot, costumes, weapons, units, or anything else.
Randomly assigning Valley place-names to Cinderella would get a movie as
accurate.

Yet an empathy to the name 'Shenandoah' makes many of us (Virginians)
see it positively. That sentiment isn't shared by Valley history buffs,
just as enthusiasm for Pocahontas or The New World isn't shared by
Virginia Indian history buffs.

If the Commonwealth wants to promote Jamestown (accurately), then
they --meaning we-- will have to pay for it.

JAB – Your comment about racism’s well taken, but there’s more to the
issue than that.

Virginia Indians were a pre-existing government structure. Powatan’s
Confederacy included almost all Virginia tribes. That organization
coexisted with the Colony and the Commonwealth for a long time, as did
its sub-units (tribes) before gradually eroding away.

It may be untidy, but there’s a good argument for admitting, or
re-recognizing, tribal political subdivisions in Virginia. Untidy or
not, there’s a fundamental validity and fairness in that. Obviously this
would be fought tooth and nail by existing jurisdictions, and has
nothing to do with Federal recognition.

For tribal recognition the Fed’s impose the ante-bellum one-eighth
rule. [For Yankees and small children, that means before the Civil War,
a person was ‘colored’ by a single black, or Indian, great-grandparent]
This is a purely racial measure; unrelated to genealogy, laws of
descent, or of title. See “consanguinity” in the Manassas threads.

Unanswered is what Virginia’s Indian descendents want, what “ the
federal status enjoyed by ... other Indian tribes ” consists of, what
its effects are, and what its unplanned results could be. <
