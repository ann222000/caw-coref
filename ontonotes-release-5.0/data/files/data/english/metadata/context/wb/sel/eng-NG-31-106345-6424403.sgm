I don't, but my friend from France does.  I asked him what the hell he
was doing, and he said, "I eat everything."  Is that what they do in
France?

Do you eat the tail of a piece of shrimp?  I don't.  Isn't it
inedible?

Why do people not eat the crusts or bread or pizza?  It doesn't taste
that different to me.

Isn't orange peel edible?  Yet everybody throws it away, even Harrison
Ford.

With peanuts from the shell, do you eat the husks?  I avoid it as it's
fatty.

Do you eat the peel of your baked potato?

If the potato is baked right, the peel is the best part!  A lot of
restaurants serve them as appetizers!  (I don't think they scoop out
the insides and throw them away, I think the peel is a by-product, but
you put some grated cheese and scallions and sour cream on them and
they're really good!)

I don't eat a lot of potatoes ('cos I'm diabetic) but my sweetie eats
them skin and all.  When she makes them at home she washes them and
oils them and sprinkles kosher salt on them.  In restaurants, she
looks for places that don't wrap them in tinfoil--that's a trick to
keep them hot a long time and it makes the skins tough and dry.

In Australia they eat kiwis skin and all.   I thought that was
strange.  They say 'Hey, it's just more fiber!'  (I'm speaking of the
fruit, not the bird).

I recommend eating a pineapple, skin and all.  Open your mouth REALLY
WIDE and bite it hard.
Once you're done, I also recommend eating cactus with the skin.

I do. I got lazy one day and just ate the darn things whole. Its become an
acquired taste. I do more often than not, now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The skin is the best part. Sometimes I'll eat the skin and leave most of the
potato on my plate.

I'm picky about oranges, though. I don't like the pith one bit, no matter
how little is on there (not enough to keep me from eating oranges, however).
So, I'm not one of those that "eats everything".

Yes.  The skin is actually where a lot of the vitamins are.
Although they may be degraded from the cooking.

I enjoy the texture.

I mean, really... Do you peel and discard the skin of an apple,
or a tomato, or a zucchini, or a cucumber?

The only things I can think of offhand, for dumping the skins,
are bananas and oranges.

And, yes, I also the crusts of pizza and other types of bread.

A shrimp tail is a completely different deal.

Before you try to show off your "knowledge," please note that,

is NOT a part of Australia.  And the food item is a kiwifruit.

Gosh... that's the interesting thing about Usenet.  Try to show
off, and you are likely to get a response from someone with
better experience and knowledge.

Anyway, I'm in NZ, and I don't eat the skin.  I would just slurp
out the green stuff from a quarter slice.  Or just cut some green
chunks.  And then compost the skins.

I don't really buy them often, though.  And the best ones get
exported to other countries.

But, well, those Australians have all kinds of strange
preferences.  Which often involve four-legged, wooly mammals,
whose food-name is, "mutton."  It's a completely different deal,
you see...

Yes. Evidently you've never been to a sports

are quite common. I believe they are on the menu
at Hooters as well ( just opened here Monday ).
Unless of course there is a green tinge to them
in the raw.

We used to call it a kiwifruit. Before that it was a Chinese
gooseberry.  Now it's just a 'kiwi'.  I'm assuming one can tell from
the context whether one is talking about a small flightless bird, a
fuzzy fruit, or a person from New Zealand.  8^)  Just as when one
orders a ham sandwich in a restaurant, the waitress understands this
person doesn't want to eat slices of an amateur radio operator between
slices of bread.

Most Americans, when they hear the word 'kiwi', think of shoe polish.

There's -always- someone who knows more than I do.  Doesn't shut me

Don't believe what someone tells you unless you confirm it.

Canada and Mexico are about 1300 miles apart on the West coast, and
about 1400 miles apart from Texas up north to the border. My ruler
applied to a map says the closest possible distance between the two, as
the crow flies, is about 1100 miles. And that only for one segment
beween a part east of San Diego and the closest point in Canada. Nearly
all other distances are more like 1200-1400 miles, as far east as
Texas. (Beyond Texas, there is no Mexico at all south of Canada...)

About  half the "width" of the country, which is generally about 3000
miles. This is the "shape" of the main rectangle that is the Lower 48.

Meanwhile, Australia and N.Z. are about 1000 miles apart:

"
Our location
New Zealand is nestled in the South Pacific Ocean 1,600 kms (1,000
miles) from Australia, our closest neighbour and friend.
"
http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportunities/aboutnz/

And considering what is around them, in other directions, and the fact
that nothing lies between them (such as another country), it's
completely fair to say that they lie close to each other. And closer
than Canada is to Mexico, in more ways than one.

I peel em, but lots do not
