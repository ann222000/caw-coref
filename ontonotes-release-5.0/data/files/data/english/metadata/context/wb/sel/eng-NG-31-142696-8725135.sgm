I was in Virginia Beach on business this past week and on Monday evening
I happened to pick up a copy of The Virginia-PILOT. I found a
fascinating article by Judy Peres at the Chicago Tribune that reported
on a study conducted by David Amodio of NYU that basically demonstrates
that conservative brains are broken. Or, to put it bluntly, they have
defective brains that don't work as correctly.

Apparently there is an area of the brain known as the anterior cingulate
cortex which, when working correctly, allows individuals to think for
themselves, react to multiple inputs, exhibit individualism and just
generally demonstrate higher cognitive functions. In conservatives this
area of the brain does not work correctly and as a result conservatives
do better in situations where they are told what to do and what to
believe. The tricky part of this it that the effect is so subtle that
conservatives will still maintain that they are superior because they
don't really understand how intelligence is measured - so they think
they are the smartest kid on the block even when it is obvious that they
are not.

Now, of course, conservatives will complain that it is sooooooo unfair
for liberals to publish such information because it casts conservatives
in a bad light. They only want to allow good things to be said. The
problem is, they simply cannot hide from the truth.

And less anyone shoot the messenger, I am not fabricating this stuff. It
is easy to find related materials on the internet.

The problem with these articles is that they are sufficiently complex to
preclude understanding by conservatives.

Out of fairness, I will provide references to the opposition point of view.

Show how that is an ad hom. To be an ad hom the argument has to be a
personal attack as in mbwana's response. Even if you consider the subject to
be a personal attack, the post didn't stop there. Ad homs are personal
attacks and no argument.

For example, if Joe Blow says: &quot;The Earth is 6000 years old&quot; and I counter:
&quot;No it's not. There is myriad evidence for the age of the Earth from dating
of terrestrial rocks, meteorites, etc. via Pb isochrons. Jeez...you're a
tool. Did you skip science class?&quot;

The above, while it does contain a personal attack, is not an ad hom since
it does attack the argument.

You actually make a good point. The creationists cannot find any
scientific support for their viewpoints so they must use legislative
tactics to make their point the only viewpoint that is authorized to be
taught. Which really just underscores the weakness of the position.

An example? Joseph Priestly never had to have any legislative body pass
a law to recognize the existence of Oxygen. All he had to do was present
scientific research.

Creationists will never counter evolution with scientific fact, so they
can only use the bully pulpit and the appeal to other religious fanatics
to try to force their viewpoint on the masses.

Because there are so many of them? Or perhaps that not enough people are
born with fully functional minds?

How many Buddhas have there been? Statistical studies tend to show that
the broad majority of mankind fit into a bell-curve pattern and one of
the consequences of the bell curve is that there will be some people on
the high side of the curve but that overall they tend to only represent
33% of the populace.

And Bruce, you have been seeing me post for a great number of years so
even you must recognize that I provided some editorial comments that
went beyond the actual contents of the article. You may have even
checked out some of the links to get a broader view of what the article
stated. But as you must also be aware, I'm not above pulling people's
chain just to see how many people don't notice that their chain is being
deliberately pulled and would rather try to attack me personally rather
then attacking my editorialization. By which I merely prove my point -
at least as it concerns them.

Straw man, not that I would think you care if your simplistic response is
any indication.

The authors don't say that the conservative mind is inferior to the point of
retardation, rather they point out that the conservative mind is *different*
and has more difficulty handling complex and contrary information. Thus,
conservatives tend to see thing more black-and-white while liberals tend to
see more of a spectrum. Is one superior to the other? The authors don't say.

Read the following from an interview of one of the authors:

ARBARA MILLER: So the conservatives don't seem to come out of this very well
at all, do they? It seems to put a more favourable light on the liberals?

DAVID AMODIO: I know, but we're quick to point out that even though some
people can construe it that way, you know, this was one task, this was one
type of psychological process. There could be situations where it might be
better to not be so easily distracted, if you will, by certain signals, and
in those cases, the conservative profile might come out looking more
beneficial.

&gt;&gt; So the game ended with the subject that started this thread. Why
&gt;&gt; didn't you speak up then?

&gt;&gt; I'm just learning this game, so bear with me.

&gt; Show how that is an ad hom. To be an ad hom the argument has to be a
&gt; personal attack as in mbwana's response. Even if you consider the subject
&gt; to be a personal attack, the post didn't stop there. Ad homs are personal
&gt; attacks and no argument.

&gt; For example, if Joe Blow says: &quot;The Earth is 6000 years old&quot; and I
&gt; counter: &quot;No it's not. There is myriad evidence for the age of the Earth
&gt; from dating of terrestrial rocks, meteorites, etc. via Pb isochrons.
&gt; Jeez...you're a tool. Did you skip science class?&quot;

&gt; The above, while it does contain a personal attack, is not an ad hom since
&gt; it does attack the argument.
">

So it is impossible to express how somebody repulses you without it being ad
hominum?

Ken is repulsive.  It's not ad hom, but it is overstating the obvious.

Certainly this theory would have plenty of anecdotal evidence.

I just wish it were possible to find more of them with the ability to
expound extemporaneously in rebuttals rather then resorting solely to
trash talk.

It reminds me of an old, old joke.

The nuns in the convent needed some construction work done so they made
the arrangements with a local contractor and pretty soon the work was
underway. The nuns were quite pleased with the progress and quality of
the work, but one day when the Mother Superior was talking to the
foreman she expressed concern that the language of the workers was a bit
coarser then they would prefer in a convent.

The foreman replied &quot;These are men of the earth. They just call a spade
a space.&quot;

The mother superior said, &quot;No they don't. They call it a 'god-damn son
of a bitching mother fucking shovel'&quot;.

And lost is (as usual with Ken) there is nothing logical to counter anyway.

All liberals molest children--care to disprove?

This is what Stahl does--make absurd statements, then run for cover.
Calling Ken out rather than trying to disprove a statement not worth the
salt in his tears, was probably the most appropriate of all responses.

Anyway, back to the original point.  All liberals are child molesters.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blames everyone else for his sorry life.  If you don't find that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repulsive, I can only say Godspeed to you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Show how that is an ad hom. To be an ad hom the argument has to be a

&gt; &gt; So it is impossible to express how somebody repulses you without it

&gt; &gt; Ken is repulsive.  It's not ad hom, but it is overstating the obvious.

&gt; Oh that's fine. Ad hominems are a valid form of insult, I suppose. But it

Brain function of liberals, conservatives differ
Yahoo News/AFP
by Marlowe Hood
September 9, 2007

The match-up was unmistakable: respondents who had described themselves
as liberals showed &quot;significantly greater conflict-related neural
activity&quot; when the hypothetical situation called for an unscheduled
break in routine.

Conservatives, however, were less flexible, refusing to deviate from old
habits &quot;despite signals that this ... should be changed.&quot;

The GOP had power because they're very good liars and they have a
massive propaganda machine that protects the faithful from ever
questioning their lies.

Bush said we could afford a trillion tax cut when we already had $5.7 of
debt.  Even today, after the debt has risen to astonishing $9 trillion,
their candidates for the presidency are still talking about tax cuts.

We're not talking about intelligent men. Instead, the GOP seems to be
pandering to the Reagan/Bush wing of the GOP - dumb people.

&gt; The authors don't say that the conservative mind is inferior to the point of

&gt; and has more difficulty handling complex and contrary information. Thus,
&gt; conservatives tend to see thing more black-and-white while liberals tend to

But we can look at real world political issues to see which side was on
the right side of history.  During the 90's the GOP said the Clinton tax
increases would throw us into a recession and make the deficits soar.
The opposite happened.

When Reagan and Bush were cutting taxes and promising to balance the
budget, the opposite happened.

When Bush was lying about WMD, liberals caught the lies, but
conservatives fell for them.

The problem seems systematic. Conservatives do as their told. They
thought Whitewater was a scandal when it wasn't. They thought there was
real intelligence supporting WMD. There wasn't. They thought we had real
surpluses to give away and of course there were no surpluses.

Conservatives can whine all they want but history shows they're
consistently wrong.

Liberals such as myself can run circles around the mindless
propagandists in the GOP.  If you open your mind just a little you'll
see that liberalism is the ONLY political ideology with a long history
of success.

Did conservative presidents balance the budget?  No. They created
massive deficits and massive debt. They either failed or they lied and
yet conservatives still defend their liars and failures.

Did Reagan do as he promised and balance the budget? No. Did Bush? No.
Did Bush pay down all our debt as he promised? No. Did Bush use the UN
inspection process to prove to the world that he was right and the world
was wrong? No.

And, after the UN inspectors said Bush's intelligence was garbage and
outdated, did conservative walk away from Bush and his war? No.

And you think you're smarter than us? Good grief.

I hope no one is missing the point that both the liberals and the
conservatives were self-identified in the study. Given the option, those
that identified themselves as conservatives tended to perform poorly in
the study while those that identified themselves as liberals tended to
perform well in the study. If conservatives had been smart (I know, I
know, I'm asking a lot) they would have identified themselves as
liberals in order to make the study results turn out more in their favor
whereas liberals simply had no good reason for identifying themselves as
anything other then what they actually are. In other words, this is one
place where the conservative tendency to lie would have actually worked
in their favor but since they'd rather wet their pants then ever
identify themselves as a liberal, the results prove the point that is
made in the study.

Sure there is. There's the peer-reviewed article. That's not worth
discussion?

LOL...OK. I guess I missed that memo. Tell me, when Republicans get caught
molesting children, are they summarily dismissed from the GOP and taken into
the Dems?

&gt;&gt; Oh that's fine. Ad hominems are a valid form of insult, I suppose.

&gt; Accusing someone of ad hominem is in fact an ad hominem fallacy - a

That's a stretch. Showing that an ad hominem is being used by a person
exposes the argument and says nothing about the person.

Yep, once one gets caught doing something, why not become a liberal and
blame the victim, especially if the victim is white?

As far as the article, a few liberals were too ashamed or too stupid to know
they were liberal.  They called themselves conservatives.  Anytime a liberal
with an IQ of 80 is mistakenly identified as a conservative, the average IQ
of both movements drop.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I was in Virginia Beach on business this past week and on Monday evening I
&gt;happened to pick up a copy of The Virginia-PILOT. I found a fascinating
&gt;article by Judy Peres at the Chicago Tribune that reported on a study
&gt;conducted by David Amodio of NYU that basically demonstrates that
&gt;conservative brains are broken. Or, to put it bluntly, they have defective
&gt;brains that don't work as correctly.

&gt; Apparently there is an area of the brain known as the anterior cingulate
&gt; cortex which, when working correctly, allows individuals to think for
&gt; themselves, react to multiple inputs, exhibit individualism and just
&gt; generally demonstrate higher cognitive functions. In conservatives this
&gt; area of the brain does not work correctly and as a result conservatives do
&gt; better in situations where they are told what to do and what to believe.
&gt; The tricky part of this it that the effect is so subtle that conservatives
&gt; will still maintain that they are superior because they don't really
&gt; understand how intelligence is measured - so they think they are the
&gt; smartest kid on the block even when it is obvious that they are not.

&gt; Now, of course, conservatives will complain that it is sooooooo unfair for
&gt; liberals to publish such information because it casts conservatives in a
&gt; bad light. They only want to allow good things to be said. The problem is,
&gt; they simply cannot hide from the truth.

&gt; And less anyone shoot the messenger, I am not fabricating this stuff. It
&gt; is easy to find related materials on the internet.

&gt; The problem with these articles is that they are sufficiently complex to
&gt; preclude understanding by conservatives.

&gt; Out of fairness, I will provide references to the opposition point of
&gt; view.

It should be noted that the Congressman who was arrested this week for
seeking child sex was elected as a Republican. A senior one at that.
