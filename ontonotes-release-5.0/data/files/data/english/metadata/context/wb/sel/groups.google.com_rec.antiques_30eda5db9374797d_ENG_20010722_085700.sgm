Seriously OFF TOPIC, but this is vital to many off us here..

I don't know how closely you have followed the debate on stem cell research,
or if you even know what a 'stem cell' is.... To put it in a nutshell, stem
cells are created in the first days of life but also exist in our blood,
skin, and bone marrow as adults. Stem cells can turn into any organ and can
cause any damaged organ to regenerate. Stem cells may revolutionize medicine
as we know it because they are applicable to just about every know disease
and condition in some way. They are of special interest to people with
cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and burn victims. They are the ONLY
HOPE for the millions that suffer from spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. By guiding the growth of
these cells it appears likely that scientists will soon be able to culture
new organs to replace ailing hearts, or neurons for the treatment of brain
disease or injury.
Concerns over the well being of embryos are misplaced. Scientists at John
Hopkins University report that the number of embryonic cell lines currently
in cultivation is sufficient to supply research needs--so that not a single
embryo needs be destroyed in future. THIS is what made up my mind: &quot;stem
cell research can now be conducted without destroying a single embryo&quot; by
using frozen test tube cultures that if not used for research would be
pitched in the dumpster anyway. (What happens is this- a couple will go to
the clinic and the clinic will harvest a number of eggs. To make sure that
one viable embryo is created they will fertilize / inseminate 5-6 eggs. The
doctor looks at them under a microscope and decides which one he is going to
implant. The other 5 are frozen as 'back up' and 99.9% of the time frozen is
where they will stay. A close friend was on the team that cloned Dolly, and
she says no doctor in their right mind would even consider using an embryo
that has been frozen for more than 5 years, and after that time most of them
go in to the dumpster.)

Stem cell research was heavily funded under the last administration.
President Bush froze the funding and for the last month has been debating
the 'ethics' of stem cell research. Make no mistake; the issue is not
MORALITY it is MONEY. Big $$$$$ have been invested in private research and
BILLIONS will be made when the breakthru happens. Fed funding (hopefully)
would bring the research out into the light and establish controls/
regulations and make the miracle accessible for you and me. That is not in
line with what some people want: more $$$$ in your pocket if you can sell it
to the highest bidder! How much would it be worth to have your husband/
wife/ parent/ child well and whole again?? I suspect what he is REALLY
debating is whether it would be less damaging politically to piss off the
well organized / funded and highly vocal 'Right to Lifers' or the millions
of Americans and their families and friends that would benefit from this
research but to this point have quietly suffered. ! I struggled with the
issue for a year. Now, before you start telling me how evil I am, and how
all life is sacred, let me state this: I believe that life begins the moment
that sperm says to egg &quot;Howdy, M'am!&quot; and that Psalm 139 is right &quot;thou has
covered me in my Mother's womb&quot; and probably that same Divine knowledge also
extends to cells in a test tube mixed by a lab assistant. BUT!!! Given that
cells have already been 'harvested' and NOTHING can change that, WHY WHY WHY
would you choose to pitch those cells into a dumpster instead of helping
MILLIONS of suffering people, especially when many of them are children? At
least, the loss of the 'potential' child would then have meaning. My
opinion is that people that are HERE NOW have an equal 'right to life' and
the need of a living, breathing, suffering child takes precedent over a
cluster of (frozen) cells the size of this period (.) ! Polls show that the
majority of Americans are undecided on this issue. I am coming out of the
closet, as a person with Parkinson's Disease, to ask you to think about this
issue, search your conscience, and if you feel you are able, encourage the
President to make the decision to restore funding for stem cell research. I
can trace PD though 6 generations of my family, and if we choose to spend as
much on this research as was spent on developing Viagra, there is a good
possibility that this condition maybe cured in my lifetime.
I realize the issue is complicated and controversial: to learn more about
stem cells and the National Institutes of Health research guidelines

I apologize for laying something this heavy on you, but the decision may be
made any day now! . These petitions support stem cell research that would
not require the destruction of human life.
