Brian Kelly was recently talking abut how incredible Johnny Smith was
and it got me thinking.

Smith is one of the most incredible players of all-time, no doubt
about it. I have his Roost Recordings, but on top of that I recently
bought Legends, on which he plays solo versions of standards and
classical and folk pieces in a more &quot;legit&quot; style.  Remarkable
technique, harmony and melody, remarkable taste and tone.

Think about just the 1950's. Your famous players included, Barney
Kessel, Tal Farlow, Johnny Smith, Jimmy Raney and Jim Hall. In the
late 50's, Wes came on the national scene. Slightly less well known at
the time might be Billy Bean, John Pisano, Kenny Burrell, Sal
Salvador. in the studios and making some of their own records were
George Van Eps, Bucky Pizzarelli, Howard Roberts, and the NYC players
like Lowe, Mottola, I'm unfairly leaving many players out.

If you hear Johnny Smith, you know it's him. You'd never confuse him
with Kessel or Farlow. You'd never think that Jim Hall was Howard
Roberts. And considering the factors limiting them, their success and
uniqueness was all the more incredible. They didn't have all the
books, DVDs, masterclasses and college programs. They did have decades
of great records to listen and learn from. Maybe that explains their
differences. Even more amazing, they didn't have the diverse options
of equipment we have today. Aside from laminate vs. solid, floating
vs. mounted pickups, their gear was very similar. An ES-350 and ES-175
are much more similar than an Ibanez Artstar and a Benedetto
Manhattan. They couldn't choose between SS and tube, head vs. combo.
It was mostly, Gibson or Fender amp, Gibson or D'angelico guitar.

The similarities in what equipment they had was remarkable, much more
so than today's players.And there was so much less known about
different styles and harmonic possibilities. And yet, they all were so
different and so wonderful. It's not easy to be a great player
nowadays, but it's even harder to be unique, especially because many
musical employers want very specific things from their players, i.e.
my boss last week who insisted that I &quot;Get that Jim Hall thing going
on the ballads, the Freddie Green thing on the swing tunes, a Benson
vibe on the hard bop and when she's singing, try to do a Joe Pass-type
of accompaniment.&quot; Yes, no problem, Sir..........

Exactly.  This is what a lot of people say these days; people all learn
from the same books, learn and practice the same stuff so all sound the
same.  One of the top horn players today told me that too (so it's not
only the old guys from the bebop era that say this).

People seem to learn more with their eyes and their heads these days.
Back then, they learned more (if not all) with their ear.

I think that's the crucial difference.

Exactly-

For instance, nearly everyone I mentioned listed Charlie Christian and
Django as their main guitar influences. And yet they sounded so
different because they learned from listening, and listened to so many
players.

For example, Jim Hall and Tal Farlow both loved Lester Young and
Charlie Christian. Both loved Bird and Django. but could any otwo
players be as different as these two?

They both listened to Bird, but Hall took from him complex harmonies,
a sense of lyricism, and a sense of playfulness. Tal took much of the
same harmonic vocabulary, but one of his lessons from Bird was staying
melodic at high speed, and using his great technique to his advantage
without overplaying.

Miles Davis said the same thing about sax players. That many who came
up in the 50's idolized Bird, but they seemed to focus on and develop
one part of his style- and their own identities grew from that.

That's right, but also because they relied on their ears to tell them
what they needed to know.  People these days listen a lot and to a
lot of different things too,  but are probably more inclined to grab
a transcription (with tab) or try to get some sort of theoretical
formula to apply from someone...

Those are great points.  I think a lot of that stuff (focus on
different areas of interest) gets lost when people start learning it
off the printed page or whatever, and it gets even more so when you
boil it all down to theoretical formulas.

Anyway, to be fair, there's plenty of great players these days too
coming out of this 'modern' approach to learning. But still...

IMO, the lack of material was a blessing in a way for the players in
those days since they had to come up with their own solutions to
problems. They didn't have anyone to verify if they were doing
it &quot;right&quot; so they had to rely on their own judgment.

Another thing is that I believe the players used to be more focused
on the feel of the music. That is in no contradiction with other
aspects of learning but the feel is the crucial element that is very
often lacking these days. It's about concentrating on the fine
details of music and dmeneding a high level of precision on that
level - I mean dynamics, groove etc.

It's easy to fall in the trap of believing that once you know the
technical stuff you can play ..that's just half the story (if that).
Getting the feel right is much harder (and more important IMO).

Smith is one of the most incredible players of all-time, no doubt
about it.

It's been over fifty years since I met Johnny and his second wife,
when he came to Chicago to play a one-niter at the Bee Hive on the
south side...famous for appearances by Prez, Sonny, Clark, Roach,
etc., etc....just about all the famous jazz giants played the famed
Bee=Hive.

That night, about every guitarist in town..including the &quot;staff&quot; boys,
came, saw, and were conquered...by Johnny's awesome technique,
swinging style and total command of the instrument.  As has been
pointed out, Tal and Barney and Herb were really turning heads at that
time.  However, Johnny was something else...a consummate guitarist who
could swing from any place on the fretboard, with immaculate dexterity
and feeling.  It was a moment the local guitar pros will never forget.
I had the pleasure of responding to Johnny's personal request, siting
alongside his beautiful new bride...keeping her company throughout the
sets...and...well, I was
star-struck by both of them...

Can't answer your question, can only echo it. Enjoyed your post very
much. Maybe they didn't have all the distractions - pre-cable..
pre-internet..pre-rock'n'roll for the most part. They played their
butts off daily with other musicians I'd bet. And when they weren't
doing that they were in the woodshed.

To be fair, you're talking about players that have stood the test of
time (and critics).  For every Jim Hall, how many guitarist where
there that sounded exactly like Charlie Christian or Wes?  I don't
know, but probably quite a few.

Yup, I agree.  I also think people forget about some other  limitations, such
as the media of the time.  A lot of Charlie Parker's  masterpieces are quite
short in length, because there was only so much room on  the 78.  That forced
players to develop the ability to make coherent,  concise musical statements,
something that isn't a consideration today, but  which I think figures as well.

It's hard to focus on the feel when you're thinking so much...

You know, watching kids grow up, it's really interesting.  I know the
spoken language/ music analogy is not a good one, but there are some
things that are interesting.

When kids grow up and start learning to speak, they just imitate and
learn.  They learn words and what things are called.  They learn
verbs and adjectives.

But nobody tells them why anything is so (grammatically). You don't
explain to them the 'system' of correct grammar.  You just correct
them when they say something wrong.

And it's amazing.  They start talking.

I bet if we stopped and explained everything from the beginning, kids
wouldn't even try to talk at all!

When kids do start learning all that other stuff (spelling, grammar
etc...), they can already converse pretty well.

I think sometimes in music, we try to learn/teach all that grammar,
spelling and all that first before we can even say &quot;I'm hungry...&quot;

Anyway, this is just a thought, and Pete, I know you know what I'm
talking about.  ;)

Hello All, A number of people have touched on this, but I think it is
very important. Live music used to be much more common and the playing
opportunities were MUCH better, in &quot;the good old days&quot;. When I joined the
union, here in Minneapolis, I went to the annual party. Most of the
people there (60's and older) don't even play out any more. Their stories
of working at one club 6-7 nights a week for years on end, raising
families and even putting them through college on a working musician's
salary, left me shaking my head. When I started gigging (early 70's) 5
and 6 nighters were not uncommon. Now a 3 nighter is very rare.
How did they get so good? They played and played and played. And often
focusing on a fairly small &quot;book&quot; of tunes.
For me to make a living, and play 4-5 nights a week, I play with lots of
bands (well over a dozen) and need to play a lot of styles and a lot of
tunes (literally thousand+). So I end up playing a lot of things
reasonably well and nothing great. If I played just 50 standards 6 nights
a week for a couple years with  the same people I imagine I would have
them down cold. (and ultimately be pretty bored). But in a month's time I
play rock, blues, reggae, funk, R+B, jazz, kid's music, Jewish music,
polkas etc.
To truly MASTER a style, I think you need to devote yourself to it, to
the exclusion of other things, and be able to do it consistently. The
number of classical virtuosos that play great funk guitar or monster jazz
players who play spot on reggae are few. And the number of guitar players
making a living playing nothing but jazz is quite small as well.
Peace
Scott Dercks

Ken,

Here is an interesting aside I heard watching the Little League World
Series the other day.

Supposedly, an MIT professor did a study to see how major league
batters hit a big league pitch. (just when they recognized the pitch
and timed their swing). He came to the conclusion it was physically
impossible to hit a major league fastball.  There is not enough time
for the brain to recognize what kind of pitch it is, where the
location of pitch is,  and to adjust the swing accordingly. Yet, major
leaguers manage to hit anyway.

Muscle memory? Precognitive action at work? Magic?

Improvising at zippy tempos or playing complex ideas over tunes may
have the same principles at work. Sometime we just unconsciously rip
through the changes putting elements we both 'know' and are 'fresh
from the ether' into a solo. If we actuallly had to 'think' about what
we are doing, it probably wouldn't work out very well.

Just a thought.

Dave Here,

For me, thinking at any tempo on any level screws me up.

just sing the melody in your head and &quot;feel&quot; what it means to you, and let your fingers do the walking through the yellow frets.

Please don't suspect any Canadian patriotism here, but Jake Langley (with
Joey DeFrancesco) appears to be following in Wes footsteps to the point of
almost hitting his Achilles' heel. Actually, Jake is the one I listen to the
most these days...

&gt; To be fair, you're talking about players that have stood the test of
&gt; time (and critics).  For every Jim Hall, how many guitarist where
&gt; there that sounded exactly like Charlie Christian or Wes?  I don't
&gt; know, but probably quite a few.

DD,

You're right on target!  Given enough time with anything, even the most impossible goal, one can get there or close to it.  Some of the great players dedicated themselves, consecrated themselves to their art and that allowed them to develop the great talent that was innate.  The same thing applies to each of us.  No one knows what his gifts truly are.

Ken,

Here is an interesting aside I heard watching the Little League World
Series the other day.

Supposedly, an MIT professor did a study to see how major league
batters hit a big league pitch. (just when they recognized the pitch
and timed their swing). He came to the conclusion it was physically
impossible to hit a major league fastball. There is not enough time
for the brain to recognize what kind of pitch it is, where the
location of pitch is, and to adjust the swing accordingly. Yet, major
leaguers manage to hit anyway.

Muscle memory? Precognitive action at work? Magic?

Improvising at zippy tempos or playing complex ideas over tunes may

I've never been a huge fan of his music, but I've always respected
Tuck Andress for his love and passion for music of all styles, his
open-mindedness, his essays on music and guitar, and innovative and
impeccable fingerstyle technique. A while back, he did a &quot;Before and
After&quot; for Jazz Times. You can still find it on their website. They
played him a Johnny Smith son he had ever heard. Before he knew who it
was, he describes the wonderful technique and sound, the great taste
and feel the player possesses. And he also wonders how the guitarist
could multi-track his lines so cleanly. When he was told it was Johnny
Smith, he said something to the effect of,

&quot;Oh, well that makes perfect sense. He was a musician's musician, and
that he could play those lines without overdubbing is astonishing.&quot;

Coming from another master at such a high technical level, that's high
praise.

Yes, there were many players who didn't stay in the game, but that
said- how many players are playing today who will be revered in 50 years?
I think the diversity and quality of those players was a special, and
astonishing thing.

This is all very true, Scott, and I'm very thankful that jazz is not
all that appeals to me as a player, since the guitar fits itself into
so many situations that are fun and valid musically. I did 10 gigs
last week, using 5 of my guitars, and they were all great fun and
challenging in their own way. They all involved some jazz, but only a
couple were &quot;jazz&quot; gigs.

It beats working for a living.

&gt; Hello All, A number of people have touched on this, but I think it is
&gt; very important. Live music used to be much more common and the playing
&gt; opportunities were MUCH better, in &quot;the good old days&quot;. When I
&gt; joined the
&gt; union, here in Minneapolis, I went to the annual party. Most of the
&gt; people there (60's and older) don't even play out any more. Their
&gt; stories
&gt; of working at one club 6-7 nights a week for years on end, raising
&gt; families and even putting them through college on a working musician's
&gt; salary, left me shaking my head. When I started gigging (early 70's) 5
&gt; and 6 nighters were not uncommon. Now a 3 nighter is very rare.
&gt; How did they get so good? They played and played and played. And often
&gt; focusing on a fairly small &quot;book&quot; of tunes.
&gt; For me to make a living, and play 4-5 nights a week, I play with
&gt; lots of
&gt; bands (well over a dozen) and need to play a lot of styles and a
&gt; lot of
&gt; tunes (literally thousand+). So I end up playing a lot of things
&gt; reasonably well and nothing great. If I played just 50 standards 6
&gt; nights
&gt; a week for a couple years with the same people I imagine I would have
&gt; them down cold. (and ultimately be pretty bored). But in a month's
&gt; time I
&gt; play rock, blues, reggae, funk, R+B, jazz, kid's music, Jewish music,
&gt; polkas etc.
&gt; To truly MASTER a style, I think you need to devote yourself to it, to
&gt; the exclusion of other things, and be able to do it consistently. The
&gt; number of classical virtuosos that play great funk guitar or
&gt; monster jazz
&gt; players who play spot on reggae are few. And the number of guitar
&gt; players
&gt; making a living playing nothing but jazz is quite small as well.

Yeah, and maybe describing such matters as &quot;impossible&quot; reflects on
the current limitations of scientific inquiry.  (And no, that's not a

Uhh, no. That's an urban legend. Take a look here:

We won't really know until 50 years...hindsight is always 20/20 ;)

There have always been great musicians, but too find the great ones
isn't always easy.  Some are barely known in their time, only to be
truly appreciated later.  Other times geniuses get left behind in the
cracks of history, even when they were well-known in their own time.

Bach is now considered to be the most important Baroque composer, yet
in his time he was mostly known for his organ playing.

And there have been a lot of great composer who had an imporant role
in the development of music which we never hear of.

History has a funny memory like that...

What I'm getting at is that if you look hard enough, you will find
some inspiring musicians in our own time. There's always great music
being made somewhere in the world...

That hindsight is 20/20 is exactly my point though- that so many
musicians music from that era has survived the test of time. And not
only that they were active at that time, but they were well-known and
revered then as now.

That's the key difference, that these players weren't obscure names
only known by musicians. And the fact is, a close look at other
periods in music history doesn't find the same number of musicians
working on such a high level. There are times when that happens, like
in the early 40's in Harlem, in the mid-60's in England, in the late
18th century in Vienna. But far more often there are periods where one
or two musicians seem to stand alone, from the viewpoint of history.

While I love many current players working today, I'm not under the
illusion that they are very well-known, or that much music produced
today will be considered &quot;classic&quot; in the future. The reason doesn't
so much have to do with quality of the music- because there is plenty
of high quality music being made today. But think of it this way- when
Tal Farlow gained fame in the early 50's, his main competition was the
old records of Charlie Christian, Oscar Moore with Nat King Cole, and
Barney Kessel. Those were the most famous players. So Tal was
different and stood out.

But if, say Pat Martino creates a brilliant, hard bop album, he's not
only competing with current players, but also with history including
his own formidable work. So it's not that great music isn't being
made, but it's hard to dislodge a &quot;classic&quot; when you're still working
in that genre. And when players like Mike Stern push the boundaries,
they have to do so by using new, modern influences which may or may
not stand the test of time.

That's great.  That's also another great example.

You can play catch with a three-year old, but it's better to just do it
rather than to try to explain the mechanics of catching or throwing a
ball (someone figured out an algorithm on how outfielders catch balls;
it's simple as moving the your location so that the ball stops moving
in the air).

If you tried to teach that to a kid, he won't learn how to catch the
ball, that's for sure.

These examples aren't perfect, of course, in discussing music.  But I
think it's something to think about...

That's true, but I think some guys are just so totally obvious; like
Brecker.  There's a lot of guys playing now that I think will stand the
test of time...

I think guys like Zorn will definitely be relevant 50 years from now.

But it's true that the ones that will be deemed relevant will be the
ones that are doing something specific to the time or era.

The best bebop players today may not be remembered, nor the best swing
bands of today because history will just go back to the original for
stuff like that...  and yeah, it's won't necessarily be about quality.

of high quality music being made today. But think of it this way- when
Tal Farlow gained fame in the early 50's, his main competition was the
old records of Charlie Christian, Oscar Moore with Nat King Cole, and
Barney Kessel. Those were the most famous players. So Tal was
different and stood out.

Dave Here,

I began playing in the 50's,  and in 54 I got my first jazz exposer.  Reinhardt's last record made a month before he died, and Tal Farlow's first solo album. were the influences.  I played those LP's till' they got so worn, they sounded like someone was making pop corn.  I still have those cuts today except now I got them off I Tunes.  They're still my inspiration.  The records were it then, there was no other instruction.

A Shakeyeye says, in those days a few good people got out there, and stayed.  With the technology boom the music business has changed drastically.  When I was working as an arranger / record producer in the 60's and 70's I can tell you, it's a wonder anything good in music got out there, and if it did it was sheer luck.

Today, the digital age has opened the floodgate, anybody can get seen and heard.  They may not make any money, but they can get seen and heard.  It's a different world now.

A few stand outs, which is the hallmark of the earlier music business, has changed into a mixed thundering herd of good, bad, excellent, and mediocer all mixed together.  If I go to a movie theater today there may be 10 different movies there. 20 a day  get advertised on TV. Which one should I see?? There is a glut of choice everywhere.  It's easier for what's good to get lost in the shuffle of mediocrity.  I think that this also has some bearing on what's happening.  Just my 60/40 hindsight.

Not true. Two French entomologists (August Magnan and Andre
Sainte-Lague) back in the 1934 proved mathematically that bees can't
*glide*. The research paper has been misquoted for years.

In fact, they were correct. Bees can't glide.

If they had claimed bees were unable to fly, and since bees have been
observed to fly, the smart money would have been that Magnan and
Sainte-Lague were, in technical language, “wrong.” But that’s not quite
the same as understanding how they actually manage it. Bees have a
unique way of rotating their wings to accomplish it. That was the
puzzling part until high speed cameras came along and filmed.

Hi Jazz guitar folks,

I think dave has a interesting point...it's not to sound negative,
but I agree that mediocrity has been prevelent in pop/rock,
contemporary music for a while...not only folks real education of
music , but also their work ethic, and general work outlook...I do
find some good music out there...but a certain amount of adequete
level is almost been lost...I've found alot of people are very
talented or not, no real in between anymore....I think alot of this
has to do with many young folks don't really get into the blues and
general improvistation....I find many young jazz students to be
almost snobby towards other types of music , which really limits what
the next generation has to offer in terms of quality...on the
flipside the &quot;alternative/punk/garage&quot; movement has been
dreadful...not to mention the love affiar society has with the &quot;rock
star&quot; mentality and image....

I say a good case of the allman bros. band for all these folks; I
just listened to  a show of their's and  it is great rock/blues music
that would educate everybody in feeling and improvisation...

anyway, hollar at you guys later...

This reference to &quot;bumblebees can't fly...&quot; was an example of overcoming the impossible used by Wes Montgomery in a radio interview sometime back in time (I have a taped copy of it).  He speaks of overcoming the imagined limitations on guitarists of his day by hard work and humility.

If you'd like, I'll dig out the tape and provide you with some specific info onthe interview.

&quot;Supposedly, an MIT professor did a study to see how major league
batters hit a big league pitch. (just when they recognized the pitch
and timed their swing). He came to the conclusion it was physically
impossible to hit a major league fastball. There is not enough time
for the brain to recognize what kind of pitch it is, where the
location of pitch is, and to adjust the swing accordingly. Yet, major
leaguers manage to hit anyway.&quot;

Hi Doc,

Major league batters guess which pitch is coming based on pitch count,
runners on base, what's working for the pitcher that game, what's not
working,
etc, etc. When a batter is looking fastball and gets a changeup, well, it's
not pretty!

Good points,

Yes, batters do get fooled. All the time by change-ups, movement on
the ball etc. They also learn to read the rotation of the baseball to
determine whether it's a fastball or breaking ball. Sometimes they
guess, sometime they can read the pitch.

My 14 year old kid has been an all star little leaguer every year
since the age of 6, so I have watched him develop into a great little
hitter over the years. Mechanics can be taught but raw talent is
innate. Some kids have a gift. Others don't.

Same with music. Some kids 'got it', others don't.

The mechanics of guitar playing can be taught also, but the raw talent
has to be there to make a good guitar player. Just what is raw talent?
I don't rightly know how to describe it, but I certainly know it when
I see it (or hear it)

I'll leave the weighty question on what constitutes innate ability or
raw talent in music and in baseball to others ....and I'll just enjoy
both.

The last of Little League world series is on ABC today and tomorrow. I
watch it religiously every year. I turned down a gig Thursday as I
would have missed several Little League games on ESPN. Hard core, huh?

Don't care so much to watch millionaires running around on a baseball
diamond, but Little League baseball is like jazz to me... the pure art
form before it gets well .....commercialized. (I don't begrudge
players making big money, but kids playing baseball is the real deal
to me)

So is jazz...

True, but we already have some perspective on guys like Brecker and
Zorn...as well Metheny, Frisell and Scofield, to mention a few
guitarists from the same era. That was 30 years ago when they were
starting out.

This is true.  Don't remind me of how old I'm getting.  'modern' can be
pretty old in jazz...

But there are a lot of younger guys now that I think will be relevant
50 years from now for sure, like Rosenwinkel (I know, he's not that
young now...).

But that's another long, hairy thread...

Nice to see someone mention Pat Metheny in this thread. After thirty
years I think he deserves some recognition as a composer as well as a
player.

Which other guitarist amoung those already mentioned has people like
Jason Vieux [ classical guitar chair at a university in Ohio ]
recording his music on classical guitar? There is also a big band who
has recorded a cd of PMG music. I don't exactly know how grammies are
awarded , if it's a peer group thing, he has been well recognised there
as well. The stuff with the Metheny Meldau quartet as well as the duo
offering is pretty nice stuff as well. I feel that by daring to play
music that is not strictly jazz but heavily influenced by it, he has
brought many new fans to the sound of jazz. I've never seen a concert
of PMG where you didn't get a nice big dose of plain old jazz along
with everything else.

I saw Jason Vieaux two or three years ago... he's a super guitarist, one
of the up-and-coming young (well, younger than I) classical players.

Yes, of course, but I posted my question here in case anyone here
actually does know the answer off-hand.

Google turned up this book during one of my initial attempts to find
info about that research online:

Hi Mike there used to be some files around on the net of him playing an
impromptu rendition of a Metheny tune very late at nite into a digital
recorder. Pretty amazing stuff as I recall. He was also the resident
hot dog for a few days on NPR's artist in residence program. I managed
to catch most of that. He's one of those guys that's got it all.

I have his Metheny CD, as well as his Ponce CD. Vieaux is one of the
very best of the y8oung breed of classical soloists, his music
breathes very naturally, with a great sound. Very impressive.

Hi Ronald, do you find PMGs music listenable for the most part. I'm
curious how he is precieved by long time jazzers. I came to jazz
appreciation later in life and was already a PMG fan by then. I have
some hearing loss and I have trouble with his upper regtister synth
solos. Not so much the content just the sound of it. Same with skronky
stuff in some jazz solos heard on the radio. But generally I the
harmonic content of their stuff. The addition of the trumpet player to
the group has had a nice effect as well. [can't remember how to spell
Kuong's name]

I thought I'd chime in here vis-a-vis PM.  I think he's a terrific  player,
and not only that, but his compositions are varied, and many.  I  bought his
songbook, and really enjoy a lot of what's in there, like &quot;Soul  Cowboy&quot;, which
sounds very influenced by Ornette Coleman, eg.  I guess I  qualify as a &quot;long
time jazzer&quot;, so I'll say that PM's music manages to combine  many different
elements, evoke a wide range of emotions, and still manage (for  the most part)
to possess jazz sensibilities.  Similar to someone like Bill  Frisell, who
occupies a different sonic aesthetic, but manages to do a lot of  the same.

The other thing I always found very interesting about PM is that when he
played the guitar synth (at least at first), he always sounded like a guitarist,
compared to someone like John McLaughlin, whose synth playing was more &quot;synth
playing&quot;, than &quot;guitar synth&quot; playing, if that makes any sense...

BTW, the trumpet player referred to is Cuong Vu, but the late Mark Ledford
also played trumpet in the PMG.  Interesting story about Cuong Vu: PM heard
his music on the radio in NYC, dug it, &amp; found Vu's phone # in the NYC phone
book.  He called him, &amp; he was in the band, pretty much just like  that.  Some
guys have ridiculous luck, no?  (It also doesn't hurt that  Cuong Vu is a fine
musician as well...)

Cheers,
JV

All players who perform at very fast tempos use pre-composed riffs and
figures to some degree or another. This isn't to diminish their
accomplishments or the level of skill and mastery required. In the
best cases, i.e. Charlie Parker, his library of riffs was so large,
that no two solos sounded alike.

That said, it's not necessarily something players are aware of- I only
notice it when I'm not particularly in good form. And pure
improvisation is mixed into that as well, it's just literally
impossible for your fingers to play for an extended time without using
a pattern they've played before.

&quot;...it's just literally impossible for your  fingers to play for an extended
time without using
a pattern they've played  before.&quot;

I agree, and would also add that oftentimes, those &quot;patterns&quot; are part of
the player's musical vocabulary, and not necessarily &quot;noodling&quot;.  Pat  Martino
comes to mind as a virtuoso player who has signature &quot;licks&quot; or  &quot;patterns&quot;
that he intersperses throughout his improvs; even Joe Pass tended to  use certain
bass lines repeatedly in his solos.  Same with Scofield's  volume swells, for
example.  It's just part of each player's  &quot;language&quot;.
