Deneille looked away and bit her lip.  &quot;I stopped his brain.  Cut the
connection, his heart wasn't beating so I couldn't stop him that
way.&quot;  She
shook it off and took Gerben's arm setting him on the bed then knelt
in
front of him looking at the knee.  &quot;Check the book, he thinks the key
is IN
the book,  so rip the binding, I'll get the bullet out as it heals.&quot;

Gerben couldn't hide his surprise that she could do something so
violent but also couldn't discourage the sence of grattitude he had
for it, she had saved his life and he felt he was hardly in any
position to argue with that- mainly because he would be dead
otherwise. He looked back to her at the mention of a key and began
flipping through the book, not so sure if it was a physical key they
were looking for- it might be words. He tapped along the cover then
tugged at the binding.

&quot;Do you think its something like sepulchures?&quot;

Deneille nodded.  &quot;His thoughts, were jumbled but he thinks the key is
physically IN the binding.  It's weird though, cause he is looking for a
matched set, but only one in the book.  It's harder to get clear images from
the dead.&quot;  She put her hands around his knee and carefully started healing
it from the inside, pushing the bullet out as she did.

**inside the covers of the book are two dug out recesses for keys.  Both
filled in with sand or some sort of dirt and a folded up letter inside the
back part from Laura explaining she hid the keys for safety, because she was
told to take them and did, but didn't want them able to use them.**

Deneille let go and sat back on her heels.  She pushed her damp hair from
her face and wiped the sweat from her face with the back of her arm.
&quot;Laura?  That's my mother, why?&quot;

Deneille looked confused but read the letter.  She flipped it over in her
hands a couple of times.  &quot;This makes no sense.  There has to be more.&quot;  She
stood up and went to the lamp yanking the shade off she put the paper on the
bulb and rubbed it from side to side until letters appeared.

Deneille swallowed and dropped the letter.  &quot;No, I really don't.&quot;  She
muttered.  She left the paper on the floor and turned from the room to head
quickly to her own.  She started throwing things in a knap sack before
running down the stairs.

**the paper had burnt etchings on the back and though it was hard to read
through the writing on the front you could just make it out.

the keys are separate but together  in the one place neither Legacy or
Illuminati will go  in the hearts of our children  it was the last thing I
could do and they will outlive either of us Derek

forgive me

Gerben picked up the letter and read it. &quot;In the hearts of..&quot; the

force. He pocketed the letter and rushed to her room.

Deneille tossed the knapsack over one shoulder and strode past him and to
the stairs.  &quot;We have to get to the hospital.  We need to make sure Nick and
Derek are all right, then distract someone in the radiology department so we
can use the room.&quot;  She flew down the stairs and looked back at him, her
face set.  &quot;Are you coming?&quot;

Deneille shook her head.  &quot;Then I'll find out.  I'll let you know when I
do.&quot;  She muttered and left out the front door.  She opened the door to the
nearest car and tossed her knapsack in ahead of her then slammed the door.
She looked for the keys and smiled that they were right in the visor.
Starting it up she buckled up and headed out.

Jim groaned and pushed himself up.  He saw the book on the bed and got up
grabbing it and heading out.

Deneille stared straight ahead.  &quot;Because we weren't children.  We were
never children, Gerben.&quot;  The few people that had treated them as such were
always quickly reassigned.  She drove to the ferry and tapped the steering
wheel impatiently while waiting for it to hit main land.

Deneille shook her head.  &quot;My mother was killed before we were a week old.
I have no idea what she did.  Only that they offered her up to some demon
they worked with as a traitor.  Supposedly that means her soul was devoured
too.&quot;  She stated it matter of fact, because that's how it had always been.
The ferry docked and she took off to the hospital.

Deneille didn't say anything until they parked at the hospital.  &quot;I don't
know what it means.  I don't know if Lucas does, I don't know how to ask
him.&quot;  She closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose for a moment.
Grabbing her knapsack she looked at him.  &quot;I don't know, almost everything.
But I DO know, Derek doesn't hear about this.  Not until I DO know.  He has
enough to worry about and there's nothing he can do.  So the only thing
telling him would do is make him worry.  So we dont' tell him.&quot;  She got out
and headed inside.

&quot;You ARE his kids.. he worry's about you all the damn time.&quot; Gerben
replied as e ducked out the car and followed Deneille into the
hospital. They were led to a small private room in which Derek sat
like a setinal guarding Nick. The look of releif on his face as
Deneille was bizarre- like she had a long awaited answer to a
difficult question.

&quot;Are you two alright?&quot; he asked quietly.

and headed out.  She looked up and down the hall until she figured out which
way the radiology was and headed down there.

Deneille got to radiology and waited until it was almost empty.  She shook
hands with the tech explaining she was a student and sent to find out how to
develop.  They took some chest shots, a DV, VD and Left Lateral.  She got
them developed  immediately then took them making sure there was no record
of them.  Shaking the tech's hand she allowed him to forget she was ever
there.  Putting the films in the envelope and then her knapsack she headed
back to Nick's room.
&quot;Has he woken up yet?&quot;

Deneille nodded and looked over at Nick.  ~Please just wake up and be all
right.  It will all be worth it if everyone is all right.~
She grabbed her knapsack and headed out.  The car had been parked in the
front and she instead headed around the back.  She looked for the nearest
bus stop and headed that way.

Gerben drumed his fingers on the steering wheel and peered out at the
hospital. ~What the hell's she doing, making a gormet lunch for him?~
he thought bitterly, growling as a hospital staff member told him to
move the car into the lot.

~Head back to the island Gerben.  Make sure security has everything taken
care of, I'm.  . . . going to stay here.~

She'd never played that as a kid, telling someone she was with another
person and vice versa, she hoped it worked.  She looked around as the bus

~ What??~ repleied Gerben who then sighed and started up the car.
&quot;Fine..&quot;

He drove back to the house, slightly anxious of actually driving a
car, and set up security once he got there.

&quot;Great.&quot; he muttered. &quot;Alone in a mansion at night with possible
murderer's outside. Wonderful- very un-cliche.&quot;

Deneille moved into the old bookstore and went right back to the private
reading room to look through the magick books.  Since she knew this was
where the real ones were.  She paged through for hours trying to figure out
what and how.

Jim had left the island with the book.

Gerben kept his post at the window and peered out into the growing
gloom then darkness. Only once it was night did he realise that he
could have been shot at any time, cringing he backed away and closed
the curtains before heading upstairs.

((thought daneille left with the book???))

((nope, it was left, and gerben grabbed the letter, so Jim got up grabbed
the book and high tailed it!))

Deneille took the notes she had and headed back to the hospital to check on
Nick.  &quot;Hey, visiting hours are over, I had to say I was his sister to get
in.  How'd you end up getting away with staying?&quot;  She asked Derek.

Derek looked up wearily and gave a weak but warm smile. &quot;I'm his
father.&quot; he stated and rubed his face. The coffe wa gone but the
muffin still sat there.

~Deneille..~ came a tiny sounding voice to Deneille's head that
gradually grew stronger to the volume of someone talking so as not to
be overheard. &quot;Hey err.. did I really get shot in the back? If I did
I'm sooooo giving the guy the second ass hole!&quot;

Denielle nodded to Derek and lowered her eyes, she looked up quickly then
smiled.  &quot;Nick? Your awake!?  How do you feel?&quot;  She moved to sit on the
other side of him.

Derek looked up startled then over to a still sleeping Nick.
&quot;Deneille... he'd not awake..&quot;

~Sore. Sore as hell. Infact worse than sore as hell...I owe that guy a
peice of lead when i get out of here! From a shot gun! Right into his
damn ass!~ he answered then fell silent. ~how are you?~

Deneille held up a hand to Derek and shook her head.  She smiled and wiped
at her eyes.  ~Better.  I couldn't heal you and I thought. . . . but your
okay now.  And we found what those guys were after.  Oh, and he is already
dead, I couldn't get a heartbeat on him at all and had to shut down brain
function to get anywhere so I don't think your shot gun will do much!~

Derek looked confused, glancing between Deneille and Nick and not
understanding what was happening.

~What?~ came Nick's reply. ~I'm just gonna have a substitute- nd this
guy will get double- one for jimbo and one of his own- thats his whole
ass gone! Nice!~

Derek leaned forward lightly as a small smirk appeared on Nick's face.

Deneille smiled and looked up at Derek, &quot;He's talking to me, he's awake, and
well, wants a gun.&quot;
She thought for a moment, thought about what Derek said earlier.  &quot;Derek, do
you, do you really think of him as your son?&quot;

Derek couldn't hide the smirk at Nick wanting a gun, but the smile
suddenly slipped away as Deneille asked her question. He looked to
Nick and, deciding he couldn't see while his eyes were closed, nodded
slowly.

Deneille thought and looked back to Nick.  ~Nick, when was the last time you
had an X ray done?~  She took his hand in hers and squeezed it anxiously.
