'Matador' With a Radio Stops Wired Bull 1965-05-17, New York Times
http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20817F9395812738DDDA... ...

The brave bull bore down on the unarmed &quot;matador&quot; -- a scientist
who had never faced a fighting bull. But the charging animal's horns
never reached the man behind the heavy red cape. Moments before
that could happen, Dr. Jose M. R. Delgado, the scientist, pressed
a button on a small radio transmitter in his hand, and the bull
braked to a halt. Then, he pressed another button on the transmitter
and the bull obediently turned to the right and trotted away. The
bull was obeying commands from his brain that had been called forth
by electrical stimulation -- by the radio signals -- of certain
regions in which fine wire electrodes had been painlessly implanted
the day before. [Experiments] have shown, he explained, that
&quot;functions traditionally related to the psyche, such as friendliness,
pleasure or verbal expression, can be induced, modified and inhibited
by direct electrical stimulation of the brain.&quot; For example, he has
been able to &quot;play&quot; monkeys and cats 'like little electro!

nic toys&quot; that yawn, hide, fight, play, mate and go to sleep on
command. With humans under treatment for epilepsy, he has increased
word output sixfold in one person, has produced severe anxiety in
another, and in several others has induced feelings of profound
friendliness -- all by electrical stimulation of various specific
regions of their brains. &quot;I do not know why more work of this sort
isn't done,&quot; he remarked recently, &quot;because it is so economical and
easy.&quot; Monkeys will learn to press a button that sends a stimulus
to the brain of an enraged member of the colony and calms it down,
indicating that animals can be taught to control one another's
behavior.

control was being developed over 40 years ago. Though this technology
can be used for good purposes, it also can and secretly has been
used to manipulate and control for many years. For lots of information

Professor Feels Himself Become Closer to the Machine 1998-09-23,
ABC News
http://web.archive.org/web/20001109140100/http://more.abcnews.go.com/... ...

When Kevin Warwick enters his office building on the campus of
Reading University, strange things happen. As Warwick heads down
the main hall, lights turn on. When he turns to the right, an office
door unbolts and opens. Each step is clocked and recorded. The
building knows who he is, where he is, and what he expects to happen.
The building [even] says, &quot;Hello Professor Warwick.&quot; The structure
knows Warwick because of the electrical fuse-sized &quot;smart card&quot;
implanted in his left arm. In Britain, he's been dubbed &quot;The Cyborg
Man,&quot; the first person known to have a microchip implanted in his
body for communication with outside machines. Warwick predicts chip
implants will one day replace time cards, criminal tracking devices,
even credit cards. Capable of carrying huge amounts of data, they
may, he says, one day be used to identify individuals by Social
Security numbers, blood type, even their banking information. No
one knows yet how the body will respond to this type of invasi!

on. Warwick is not blind to the ethical questions of this technology.
Implants ostensibly designed to clock workers in and out might be
misused to monitor where people are at all times and who they are
meeting. Governments could move to use implants instead of I.D.
cards and passports, but what would stop them from using this new
science to invade privacy? &quot;I feel mentally different. When I am
in the building I feel much more closely connected with the computer.&quot;

Note: Those who would like to control the public named these implants
&quot;smart cards&quot; to encourage us to accept them. For more reliable

An Orwellian solution to kids skipping school 2007-02-20, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution (Atlanta's leading newspaper)
http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2007/02/19/0220tru...

Let's say your teenager is a habitual truant and there is nothing
you can do about it. A Washington area politician thinks he might
have the solution: Fit the child with a Global Positioning System
chip, then have police track him down. &quot;It allows them to get caught
easier,&quot; said Maryland Delegate Doyle Niemann (D-Prince George's),
who recently co-sponsored legislation in the House that would use
electronic surveillance as part of a broader truancy reduction plan.
&quot;It's going to be done unobtrusively. The chips are tiny and can
be put into a hospital ID band or a necklace.&quot; Niemann's legislation
mirrors a bill sponsored by state Sen. Gwendolyn Britt (D-Prince
George's). Both would provide truants and their parents with better
access to social services, such as mental health evaluations and
help with schoolwork. Electronic monitoring would be a last resort.
Still, the prospect of tagging children and using them in some
&quot;catch and release&quot; hunt by police casts a pall over ever!

ything that's good about the plan. Odd how billions and billions
of dollars keep going to a war that almost nobody wants, but there's
never enough to fund the educational programs that nearly everybody
says are needed. Aimed solely at students in Prince George's -- the
only predominantly black county in the Washington area -- the truancy
effort is called a &quot;pilot program,&quot; a first-of-its-kind experiment.
It would cost $400,000 to keep track of about 660 students a year.

Live rats driven by remote control 2002-05-05, The Guardian (One
of the U.K.'s leading newspapers)
http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,708454,00.html

Scientists have turned living rats into remote-controlled,
pleasure-driven robots which can be guided up ladders, through ruins
and into minefields at the click of a laptop key. The project ...
is funded by the US military's research arm. Animals have often
been used by humans in combat and in search and rescue, but not
under direct computer-to-brain electronic control. The advent of
surgically altered roborats marks the crossing of a new boundary
in the mechanisation, and potential militarisation, of nature. In
10 sessions the rats learned that if they ran forward and turned
left or right on cue, they would be &quot;rewarded&quot; with a buzz of
electrically delivered pleasure. Once trained they would move
instantaneously and accurately as directed, for up to an hour at a
time. The rats could be steered up ladders, along narrow ledges and
down ramps, up trees, and into collapsed piles of concrete rubble.
Roborats fitted with cameras or other sensors could be used as
search and rescue!

aids. In theory, be put to some unpleasant uses, such as assassination.
[For] surveillance ... you could apply this to birds ... if you
could fit birds with sensors and cameras. Michael Reiss, professor
of science education at London's Institute of Education and a leading
bioethics thinker ... said he was uneasy about humankind &quot;subverting
the autonomy&quot; of animals. &quot;There is a part of me that is not entirely
happy with the idea of our subverting a sentient animal's own
aspirations and wish to lead a life of its own.&quot;

Note: Remember that secret military projects are almost always at
least a decade in advance of anything you read in the media. For

Radio frequency identification keeps tabs on goods, services, pets
- even people 2006-05-11, Sacramento Bee (the leading newspaper of
California's capital city)
http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/story/14254188p-15069873c.html

Feel like you're being followed? Maybe it's a tracking tag on your
jeans or one implanted in a credit card. The tags are called radio
frequency identification or RFIDs, and every day they are becoming
more and more a part of our lifestyle. These Orwellian microchips,
as minute as a grain of sand, identify and track products and even
lost children at theme parks. They're being implanted in humans to
alert hospitals about medical conditions. The tags can be so tiny,
you may never know they are there. Retailers claim RFIDs are
essential: alerting them when they're low on lipstick, air filters,
sodas and other inventory. Embedded tags aren't so obvious. Hitachi
Europe recently developed the world's tiniest RFID integrated
circuit, small enough to be placed in a piece of paper. Some RFID
chips are made to be imbedded in livestock, in pets and most recently
in humans for a variety of reasons. RFID prices have dropped, and
tagging has become practical for businesses. In-Stat, a hig!

h-tech research firm, reports more than 1 billion RFID chips were
made last year and predicts that by 2010 the number will increase
to 33 billion. Slightly larger than a grain of rice, RFID chips
from VeriChip of Florida are manufactured for implanting in humans.
The Food and Drug Administration approved human implants two years
ago.

Technology gets under clubbers' skin 2004-06-09, CNN News
http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/06/09/spain.club

Queuing to get into one nightclub in Spain could soon be a thing
of the past for regular customers thanks to a tiny computer chip
implanted under their skin. The technology, known as a VeriChip,
also means nightclubbers can leave their cash and cards at home and
buy drinks using a scanner. The bill can then be paid later. Clubbers
who want to join the scheme at Baja Beach Club in Barcelona pay 125
euros (about US $150) for the VeriChip -- about the size of a grain
of rice -- to be implanted in their body. Then when they pass through
a scanner the chip is activated and it emits a signal containing
the individual's number, which is then transmitted to a secure data
storage site. The club's director, Conrad Chase, said he began using
the VeriChip, made by Applied Digital Solutions, in March 2004
because he needed something similar to a VIP card and wanted to
provide his customers with better service. He said 10 of the club's
regular customers, including himself, have been impla!

nted with the chip, and predicted more would follow. &quot;I know many
people who want to be implanted,&quot; said Chase. &quot;Almost everybody now
has a piercing, tattoos or silicone. Why not get the chip and be
original?&quot; Chase said VeriChip could also boost security by speeding
up checks at airports, for example. He denied the scheme had any
drawbacks. The VeriChip is an in-house debit card and contains no
personal information.

Note: Why is the media so upbeat about this? The article raises
very few questions, yet seems to promote microchip implants in
humans as the wave of the future for commerce.

Professor has nightmare vision of global positioning technology
2003-05-07, WantToKnow.info/Kansas City Star (Leading newspaper of
Kansas City) http://www.WantToKnow.info/030307kansascitystar

Jerome Dobson is not joking. The University of Kansas research
professor, a respected leader in the field of geographic information
technologies [speculates about] &quot;geoslavery&quot; -- a form of technological
human control that could make &quot;George Orwell's 'Big Brother' nightmare
... look amateurish.&quot; He's talking about overlords electronically
punishing errant workers. He's talking about the possibility of
people hooked to, tracked by, and potentially shocked or burned
using inexpensive electronic bracelets, manacles or implants. Dobson
worked for 26 years at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory
creating, for the government, the maps used in global tracking. He
is the president of the American Geographical Society. And he is
not alone in his thoughts. [In] the journal published by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a paper titled &quot;Geoslavery&quot;
is co-written by Dobson and Peter F. Fisher, British editor of the
International Journal of Geographical Informati!

on Science. &quot;Human tracking systems, currently sold commercially
without restrictions, already empower those who would be masters.
Safeguards have not yet evolved to protect those destined to be
slaves,&quot; they wrote. With a laptop computer, employers can keep
track of their drivers' every move. Implanted chips ... keep track
of livestock or pets. Whereify Wireless Inc. sells its GPS Kids
Locator for $400. The device, which also looks like a watch, can
be locked to a child's wrist. Dobson said that ... none of the
companies was thinking of anything nefarious. [Yet he] worries that
where there is an evil will, there is an evil way. He hopes [to]
create debate and perhaps legislation or safeguards around the
technology that will keep it from being misused.

Scientists develop 'brain chip' 2003-03-12, BBC News
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2843099.stm

US scientists say a silicon chip could be used to replace the
hippocampus, where the storage of memories is co-ordinated. They
are due to start testing the device on rats' brains shortly. If
that goes well, the Californian researchers will test the artificial
hippocampus in live rats within six months and then monkeys trained
to carry out memory tasks before progressing to human trials once
the chip has been proved to be safe. The hippocampus is an area at
the base of the brain in humans, close to the junction with the
spinal cord. It is believed it &quot;encodes&quot; experiences so they can
be stored as long-term memories in another part of the brain. The
researchers were able to devise a mathematical model of a whole
hippocampus. The model was then programmed on to a chip. They suggest
the chip would sit on a patient's skull, rather than inside the
brain. Bernard Williams, a philosopher at Oxford University, UK,
who is an expert in personal identity, said people might find the
tech!

nology hard to accept at first.

Note: Consider that top secret military experiments in almost all
fields are generally at least a decade ahead of anything reported
in the media. What do you think they might have developed by now?
Could they have developed a way to erase and even replace memories?

Chips: High Tech Aids or Tracking Tools?

2007-07-22, ABC News/Associated Press
http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3402044

CityWatcher.com, a provider of surveillance equipment, attracted
little notice itself until a year ago, when two of its employees
had glass-encapsulated microchips with miniature antennas embedded
in their forearms. The &quot;chipping&quot; of two workers with RFIDs radio
frequency identification tags ... was merely a way of restricting
access to ... sensitive data and images ... the company said.
Innocuous? Maybe. But the news that Americans had, for the first
time, been injected with electronic identifiers to perform their
jobs fired up a debate over the proliferation of ever-more-precise
tracking technologies and their ability to erode privacy in the
digital age. To some, the ... notion of tagging people was Orwellian.
Chipping, these critics said, might start with Alzheimer's patients
or Army Rangers, but would eventually be suggested for convicts,
then parolees, then sex offenders, then illegal aliens until one
day, a majority of Americans, falling into one category or another,
w!

ould find themselves electronically tagged. &quot;It was scary that a
government contractor that specialized in putting surveillance
cameras on city streets was the first to incorporate this technology
in the workplace,&quot; says Liz McIntyre, co-author of Spychips: How
Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Move
with RFID. Within days of the company's announcement, civil
libertarians and Christian conservatives joined to excoriate the
microchip's implantation in people.

Note: For educated speculation on how certain powerful people might
like to have everyone implanted with microchips for security and
control purposes, click here.

Students ordered to wear tracking tags 2005-02-09, MSNBC News
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6942751

The only grade school in this rural town is requiring students to
wear radio frequency identification badges that can track their
every move. Some parents are outraged, fearing it will rob their
children of privacy. The badges introduced at Brittan Elementary
School on Jan. 18 rely on the same radio frequency and scanner
technology that companies use to track livestock and product
inventory. The system was imposed, without parental input, by the
school as a way to simplify attendance-taking and potentially reduce
vandalism and improve student safety. Some parents see a system
that can monitor their children's movements on campus as something
straight out of Orwell. This latest adaptation of radio frequency
ID technology was developed by InCom Corp., a local company co-founded
by the parent of a former Brittan student, and some parents are
suspicious about the financial relationship between the school and
the company. InCom has paid the school several thousand dollars for
agr!

eeing to the experiment, and has promised a royalty from each sale
if the system takes off, said the company's co-founder, Michael
Dobson, who works as a technology specialist in the town's high
school.

Passports go electronic with new microchip 2004-12-09, Christian
Science Monitor http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1209/p12s01-stct.html

The US passport is about to go electronic, with a tiny microchip
embedded in its cover. The chip is the latest outpost in the battle
to outwit tamperers. But it's also one that worries privacy advocates.
The RFID (radio frequency identification) chip in each passport
will contain the same personal data as now appear on the inside
pages - name, date of birth, place of birth, issuing office - and
a digitized version of the photo. But the 64K chip will be read
remotely. And there's the rub. The scenario, privacy advocates say,
could be as simple as you standing in line with your passport as
someone walks by innocuously carrying a briefcase. Inside that case,
a microchip reader could be skimming data from your passport to be
used for identity theft. Or maybe authorities ... want to see who's
gathered in a crowd and surreptitiously survey your ID and track
you. Why not choose a contact chip, where there would be no possibility
of skimming, asks Barry Steinhardt, director of the A!

CLU's Technology and Liberty Project. &quot;There was another way to go,
which was to put an electronic strip in the passport that would
require contact.&quot; The State Department says it's just following
international standards set by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), under the umbrella of the United Nations. The
ICAO specified the RFID ... at the behest of the United States. All
countries that are part of the US visa-waiver program must use the
new passports by Oct. 26, 2005. Mr. Steinhardt ... says the US
pushed through the standards against the reservations of the
Europeans. &quot;Bush says at the G8 meeting, 'We have to adhere to the
global standard,' as though we had nothing to do with it,&quot; he says
in exasperation.

A Real Chip On Your Shoulder 2003-07-17, CBS News/Associated Press
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/17/tech/main563819.shtml

A U.S. company launched Thursday in Mexico the sale of microchips
that can be implanted under a person's skin and used to confirm
everything from health history to identity. The microchips ... went
on sale last year in the United States. The microchip, the size of
a grain of rice, is implanted in the arm or hip and can contain
information on everything from a person's blood type to their name.
In a two-hour presentation, Palm Beach, Florida-based Applied Digital
Solutions Inc. introduced reporters to the VeriChip and used a
syringe-like device and local anesthetic to implant a sample in the
right arm of employee Carlos Altamirano. &quot;It doesn't hurt at all,&quot;
he said. &quot;The whole process is just painless.&quot; Antonio Aceves, the
director of the Mexican company charged with distributing the chip
here, said that in the first year of sales, the company hoped to
implant chips in 10,000 people and ensure that at least 70 percent
of all hospitals had the technology to read the devices. O!

ne chip costs $150 and has a $50 annual fee. Users can update and
manage their chips' information by calling a 24-hour customer service
line. The VeriChip can track subjects who are within 5 miles, but
officials want to develop a new chip that can use satellite technology
to track people who are farther away and may have been kidnapped.
While the idea of using the chip to track people has raised privacy
concerns in the United States, the idea has been popular with
Mexicans. The company hopes to have the new anti-kidnapping chip
developed by 2003.
