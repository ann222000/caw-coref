The way in which so much of the US press neglected to exercise their
faculties of critical reasoning in the face of Bush administration
claims about Iraq has generated remarkably little writing or
self-reflection. It is in fact quite striking that talking heads and
journalists who were completely wrong about Iraq, such as Judith Miller,
appear to have more or less gotten away with it.

Michael Massing's incisive review of the issue , forthcoming in the
New York Review of Books, is available online at the indispensable
Tomdispatch.com. Massing begins with the Fassihi incident and the Wall
Street Journal:

' Toward the end of September, Farnaz Fassihi, a correspondent for
the Wall Street Journal in Baghdad, sent an e-mail to forty friends
describing her working conditions in Iraq. Fassihi had been sending out
such messages on a regular basis, but this one seethed with anger and
frustration. "Being a foreign correspondent in Baghdad these days," she
wrote, "is like being under virtual house arrest.... I avoid going to
people's homes and never walk in the streets. I can't go grocery
shopping any more, can't eat in restaurants, can't strike a conversation
with strangers, can't look for stories, can't drive in any thing but a
full armored car, can't go to scenes of breaking news, can't be stuck in
traffic, can't speak English outside, can't take a road trip, can't say
I'm an American, can't linger at checkpoints, can't be curious about
what people are saying, doing, feeling. And can't and can't." . . .

Interestingly, no such account appeared in the Wall Street Journal.
For Fassihi's criticism of Bush administration policy outraged some
readers, who insisted that she could no longer write about Iraq with the
necessary objectivity. In response, the Journal announced that Fassihi
was going to take a previously scheduled vacation from Iraq and that
this would keep her from writing anything more about it until after the
US election . . . '

I remember the WSJ actually saying that Fassihi wouldn't be allowed
to report on Iraq again until after the Nov. 2 elections, once this memo
leaked. It was as though she were now viewed as biased against Bush
because she simply reported the reality.

I talk to journalists in Baghdad by phone, and they really are stuck
in their hotel rooms. One told me of fears of being kidnapped, because
shady characters follow the journalists if they try to go out.

Massing is right about the massive politicization of media coverage
of the war and the ways in which editors' desperate search for
"even-handedness" favors Bush. If you have a mix of nine persons from
across the mainstream US political spectrum, the addition of a 10th who
is an extremist of some sort (say a fascist) would skew the average of
the whole group substantially. Since Bush administration positions are
often extreme and even fantastic, counting them as "one side" of a
two-sided story ensures that the line demarcating the "sides" is drawn
very substantially to the right of where mainstream US political opinion
tends to come down.

Speaking of press coverage, The Independent has a piece on
VanityFair.com , the magazine's lively Web offering. The Independent
quotes contributing editor James Wolcott as saying that bloggers are
"the best thing to hit journalism since the political pamphlet." It
seems to me that this characterization of weblogs as a form of
"political pamphlet" is historically suggestive. Robert Darnton's work
on the 18th century Grub Street as a context for the Enlightenment has
shown the importance of pamphleteering. May we be so luck as to get a
major intellectual movement out of all this blogging!
