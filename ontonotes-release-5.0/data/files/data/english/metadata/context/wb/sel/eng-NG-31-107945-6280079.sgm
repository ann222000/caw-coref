I have a datalogger, I have an IPAQ, and I have all the cabling etc.
I have spent considerable time at Cumulus Soaring, reading the
comparisons of glider software.  What I lack is the experience to know
what is important.  I've played with the features of SeeYou Mobile,
and frankly, most of the high end graphics stuff on the map just makes
it hard to read.
Many of you on this list have flown with this stuff, and done some
sorting out. I tend toward simpler and easier to use, rather than
bleeding edge, "every bit of information you could possibly want"
tools.
The only thing that is a go-nogo for me is a graphical display of
landing areas within glide under current conditions - a feature most,
if not all, seem to have.
Oh, another factor: a friend purchased WinPilot, SeeYou, and
StrePla.  He's become used to WinPilot, and has offered to GIVE me
StrePla.  Can it be set up so "Even a Caveman" can use it?

Thanks,
Jim

Nothing is very easy about the soaring programs which run on the
PDAs.  People tend to purchase what their flying pals use.  Tribal
knowledge is good but may be costly if you purchase something you
really don't like.  I'm with you, all the bells and whistles look
great, an may be good for the very accomplished pilots, but for little
old me?

One thought is to get one of the free soaring programs and try those
for a while.  Get your feet wet so to speak.   Another idea is to go
with a minimalist program like Glide Navigator II which isn't too
expensive.

Good luck, John

Hi,

&gt; What I lack is the experience to know what is important.

Same for me. I can only second John and suggest you try one of the free
packages (for you that may include StrePla :-)).

I spent some quality time with my PDA and XCSoar[1] yesterday. Installation
was quite straightforward and maps and datafiles for germany easily found. I
drove the software from the NMEA-Generator found at [2].

I also did the same with GPS_LOG[3]. I even had two flights with the software
last summer, but not long enough to give a really well-funded opinion.

Overall I like XCSoar a little bit better now. Out-of-the-box it seems to do
a better job at automatically selecting and displaying useful information.

Especially regarding your requirement:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   The only thing that is a go-nogo for me is a graphical display of
&gt; landing areas within glide under current conditions
">

In GPS_LOG you have to explicitly select "Get Landing site" to view a list
of options.

XCSoar has landing sites marked in the main map, highlighting those that are
reachable and showing at what altitude you will be arriving. You can tap
the magenta dot and be given detail information about the landing site. This
works with fat finger on IPAQ display, not only with pen and exact aiming, so
I guess it should be doable in the cockpit.

Both take current conditions into account including wind. Both can derive
wind (at least) from GPS fixes while circling.

Using a simulator (not necessarily a FLIGHT simulator), is a good and safe
way of getting acquainted. You have to fiddle with the knobs in the atlsoft
generator a lot to simulate live air, but even if you don't a lot of the
features of the programs become apparent.

&gt; and frankly, most of the high end graphics stuff on the map just
&gt; makes it hard to read.

Both free programs can be fine-tuned to your liking in that regard. In XCSoar
it is quite easy to switch the display of labels, terrain and topography
in-flight

I have found the Condor soaring simulator to be a great way to test
PDA software. I find it far more effective than the demo modes most
software has. It comes very close to the real thing. You can simulate
all kinds of situations and actually test how the PDA reacts. It also
has the advantage of having to concentrate on flying the simulator as
well as working with the PDA - just like in real life. This shows bad
usability far more quickly than pure demo modes.

One of those free programs is SoarPilot. It's got a dedicated following,
is comprehensive and is well supported by its creators.

You can read all about it here...

And you can download it here...

Your friend may have inadvertently shortened your choice list, if he
kept the other 3 for himself.......

Simpler and easier do not exist, it's the nature of the software
richness and flexibility.

Ask the guys you fly with what they chose, they will be the ones to
help you in times of confusion.

If you already have desktop software for flight planning, get the
flight software which most easily shares the waypoints, terrain, etc.
set up on the desktop. And always spot check any transferred data for
accuracy. I learned that early with shareware solutions. In flight the
software products have equivalent functions, ease of use and their
data interface then become more important.

SeeYou Mobile lets you turn off any display feature which irritates
you, as do the others I'm sure. Keep in mind it has 2 map displays and
each is configured separately for whatever use you want to make of
that. Cruise with one map, thermal on the other.

Do you fly in various locations? Sharing the ship? Find the one that
lets you easily change sets of waypoints and airspace, terrain, etc.
The 'Profile' feature in SeeYou is quite good at managing named sets
of related files on the PDA and retaining personal display preferences
for multiple pilots.

Software locked to a hardware serial number is not as flexible in
'hardware failure recovery mode' as those which are not. A nit.

Keep ALL your data on SD or CF. And take a copy of that regularly.
Losing PDA power wipes memory, so have everything on external media.
Take regular PDA backups to both SD and desktop. I had an SD card
fail, it's ugly.

Keep your eyes out of the cockpit.

I second the suggestion of Condor.  It also works to output NMEA data from
SeeYou in animate mode so the PDA displays just what it would have during
the real flight.

In general, people tend to like the PDA software they know best.  Simulators
let you get to know them all.

Though Condor does simulate flight PDA computer software on-screen,
I'd like to point out/clarify that Condor allows you the option to
integrate a "REAL" PDA with the PC running the simulator.   You are
actually manipulating your physical PDA (running "real" XC software)
on your desk the same as you would in flight.  I can't imagine a
better training aid for today's PDA XC soaring software.  One might
justify the cost of Condor on this alone....besides being a fantastic
racing simulator.

James,

I sell both WinPilot &amp; SeeYou.  I have found after 5 years of
consulting on and selling PDA programs that:

1. They are as easy to use and learn as any flight computer or logger
and offer many more functions.   It does require some time to learn
and you do have to read the manuals.  If you install any flight
computer or PDA system in your glider and then expect to immediately
fly with it without the required learning you will be dissapointed.
2. The PDA systems allow you to learn almost anywhere, work, home, in
the back yard, on the sofa.   The simulator programs in the software
allow you to do this on your PDA.  WinPilot and SeeYou are fully
functional in the SIM mode.
3.  I recommend that you bring up the manual for the program on your
desktop computer and with the PDA in hand go through the manual one
time.  This at least this gives you an overview of what is available
in the program. And  helps you learn the program.  This can be done
with either program and does not require purchase.
4. As always I am reachable on the phone, most all the time, and if
not will return your call.   Days, evenings and weekends.  Usually it
is a simple thing to get you out of a jam.  So a call will with PDA in
hand will save much time and frustration.
5. The hardest thing for most people is learning the file structure in
your desktop Windows PC, this is required with any flight computer,
logger or PDA system.  It is not specific to PDA Systems.   I spend
more time with people on this that the actual programs.
6. Free is a very good price, but generally you get what you pay for,
if anyone finds this not true please let us all know so we all can all
get this free stuff.   The best free thing I have found is the SeeYou
Connect Me program.

The problem with this is that Condor terrain data sets don't exist
anywhere near the places I fly, and my PDA doesn't have any data for
the places Condor does have. (You can, of course, load up the PDA
data.)

If you're lucky and the terrains overlap, it's a great tool!

Richard,

I think that everyone understands that the free programs do not give
you the features or support of the for-pay programs.  SeeYou Mobile,
StrePla and WinPilot are great top-end programs.  There is something
to be said for having someone to call to sort out problems.  It is
great to have a friend who flies the same software to provide face to
face help.

That being said the for-pay programs are fairly expensive to just jump
straight into.  The fear of spending money for something that is too
(much/complicated/fancy/annoying/etc) is real.

Thus the free software, while admittedly is not as good as the for-pay
stuff, can suffice for the new XC pilot.  It allows him a stepping
stone to the more complicated programs, getting his feet wet so to
speak.  To me the next step up is Glide Nav (for-pay) and then onto
the top drawer products.

Not everyone needs the feature sets of those for-pay programs.  I know
that I don't as of yet but I can now see more clearly what those
benefits are and will one day move up.

Mike,

First of all you brought up the issue of how great the free programs
are - compared to what?   WinPilot and SeeYou simulators are free,
both can be downloaded from my website for evaluation, you only need
the passwords to have a hassel free connection to your GPS.

My biased opinion is the SeeYou and WinPilot are as easy or easier to
use than the free programs, they will be supported in the future, they
allow the new pilot all the features from just flying around the
patch, to badges, records and contest.
The real question is if you own a sailplane how much did you pay for
it and is the cost of one of these programs significant?  If it is, I
would suggest a chart with mileage and altutude circles is more cost
effective, I believe you are still required to carry a chart.

I also provide support to those that are considering purchasing
WinPilot or SeeYou from Craggy Aero.

First of all I did not bring up how great free programs were- you
brought up how worthless they are-if you care to check your post. I
mentioned however that XCSOAR is a good program -which it is.

Come on Richard, tell us point by point how superior See You is over
XCSOAR .  Prove your point to us-that it is a worthless  program-you
know....as you say that it is worth what you pay for it.

I initially used GPS-Log.  GPS-Log does have a PC simulator.  It gave me
some insight into the value of a flight computer.

I subsequently switched to SeeYou Mobile for ease in loading my PDA with
maps, airspace, waypoints, etc.  I may not have fully understood GPS-Log,
but I was doing a lot of handcrafting of files.  Also, I think SeeYou Mobile
screens are more customizable.  I keep changing mine as I haven't yet
settled on what I like best.

On the support side, Henryk Birecki (software developer) was always very
responsive to emails I sent.  He is active in the Yahoo Group for GPS_Log.

Finally, my choice of SeeYou Mobile over Pocket Strepla or WinPilot was
based on the fact that I had previously purchased and learned to use SeeYou.
I'm very happy with SeeYou and I believe my life would be less complicated
if I used the PDA version of the product in the air.

To All:

I have in my iPAQ GN II and WinPilot that my buddy Richard sold me.
Richard is a very nice guy and some of you have misinterpreted his
posting. Now, as I said, I have GN II and WinPilot and I fly with GN
II...why? because I like the simplicity of GN II and the information
available on the screen of my PDA. The WinPilot has a bunch of
features that I don't think I'll ever use or need. There is simply to
much information displayed. But again, we are creatures of habit and I
think that we fly with what we feel most comfortable with. But then
again, download the free simulator and try it. See what you like and
make your own mind. Don't relay 100% on opinions of other pilots.

Rather than talk about which glide computer program is best... what I
need to know is: What INFORMATION/FEATURES do you experienced guys
find MOST useful in XC soaring.  I've done only a very little XC (one
flight, Tonopah - Austin - Tonopah), and what I wanted most during
that flight was an easily interpreted bearing and required glideslope
to known good runways/landlouts. I know that once I have that, I'll
start thinking of other features that would be helpful. The question
is, what features do you find most useful?
thermal optimizer?
FAI triangle thing?

There.  You have answered your own question.  All you need is a

these data or links to them.  Then just turn off the on-screen Condor

It's asking too much of a dealer to give unbiased reports on products he
does not sell, and even it the dealer managed to achieve it, many would
still just assume his monetary interest took priority. So, the dealer
spends a lot of time for very little return.

In fact, it is just plain difficult to write an unbiased report on these
products, even if you aren't selling them. These programs have many
features, most of them in common but with variations, and the value and
appeal of each feature/variation depends a lot on the pilot's
personality, where he flies, what he flies, and how he flies.

It gets worse: a really experienced pilot comparing these products will
write quite a different review than one with moderate experience.

And worse: after a pilot flies with a particular product for year or so,
he'll often find he uses it differently than when he started. Try to
account for that in a review!

So, download the programs and try them in simulator mode. I like the
suggestion to "fly" with it on flight simulator like Condor. And keep in
mind they all do the basics, which it is 80-90% of what most of us need
done.

For me, I want to know in real-time exactly how far I can glide in all
directions computed from my polar, McCready setting, ballast, bugs, wind and
terrain elevation.  I don't want a list of airports or airports with green
or magenta circles.  I want my glide footprint on the moving map.  This
tells me a lot about options, alternates and helps with strategy.  So far as
I know, only two programs have implemented this GPS_LOG WinCE and XC-Soar.
I use GPS_LOG WinCE which does a better job of it.

While I'm at it, I'd like this feature on SeeYou animationl.  That would
make it easier to see exactly what the pilots options were as the flight
progressed.

Ahh,   PDA's and software...don't let anyone tell you
any of this is 'simple'.  You like MS ActiveSync?,
constantly keeping the PDA out of the sun but on a
charger?, trying to read a screen in the sunlight?,
dealing with downloading to the OLC, or worse yet..a
badge claim?

But having said that....you do adapt to them....and
they make us fly faster and farther IMVHO.  I recall
a fellow at Boulder one day who was extremely excited
about his new color PDA and the advanced software on
it...I was just passing through and it seemed to me
that with strong lift conditions....he might be flying
rather then on the ground dweebing.

On the flip side there are those who don't want to
go near the things.  They do make decision making more
linear in my opinion.

So try the sims...and then analyze your needs....like
most everyone else...you either decide to go more simple,

Hi,

&gt; I want my glide footprint on the moving map.

This depends very much on accurate terrain elevation data. I am not sure
how good the publicly available data is. It does paint pretty pictures
in any case.

Elevations for airfields are very accurate and those for charted landouts
at least at GPS-accuracy.

Ciao, MM

I'm using an elevation database accurate to less than one meter on a 100m
grid.  That's far more that accurate enough to provide a glide footprint.  I
choose not to display this as a visible map since it make more important
data hard to read and takes processing power.  I just display airports,
turnpoints and the glide footprint.

What is the advantage of a glide footprint to your soaring? Is it useful
in the mountains, or only in flatter terrain? Knowing I can reach an
unknown patch of ground doesn't sound useful, so I suspect I'm missing
something.

Eric,

Most soaring software that I have seen simply evaluates whether you will
clear obstacles along the flight path from your current position to the
selected destination. If the route is over Pikes Peak, it doesn't consider
going around it. Is there any software that identifies and calculates the
altitude require for the best route to a field?

I don't know of any that does it automatically or even manually in an
easy way. I've encouraged SeeYou to add a feature that lets the pilot
"drag" the middle of the flight path to a new location, so you have an
adjustable two leg flight path around an obstacle. No feature yet.

I think the feature would very useful, and not just for mountains, but
for avoiding airspace, bad landing areas, and poor soaring areas
(wlakes, wet fields, wave or ridge downdrafts). You could also align the
path for good soaring areas.

All of them will let you set up a task to do it, but that's usually a
lot of picking and clicking at an inconvenient time. For repeating
situations, you can add waypoints in passes and valleys to your
database, so it's easier to set up a task in flight.

Eric, it's a matter of laying all options on the table.  I have found that
GPS_LOG WinCE showed options that I would not have otherwise considered.  It
wasn't a mater of not being able to compute (or estimate) all options, but
of being too focused on the flight plan to see them.

An example is a flight where it had become clear that I wasn't getting home
so the task became getting as close as possible, landing at a convienient
airport to reduce the retrieve distance.  Playing back the IGC file on
SeeYou with output to the PDA showed that for about two minutes I had a safe
glide to an airport that would have cut the retrieve by 200 miles of
mountain driving.  During those two minutes, I was distracted and didn't see
the option.  If I had a glide footprint display, it would have been too
obvious to miss.

A moving map with a glide footprint display is very easy to interpret so I
won't miss good alternatives again.  I will never fly without it again even
though I own licenses for Glide Navigator II and WinPilot.  If I use those,
it will be on a second PDA showing only the data boxes.

A "glide footprint" shows clearly how to cross a mountain range since it
computes glide distance in all directions.  The courseline may happen to
cross the range at a high peak so a list type display will show the goal as
unreachable but the "glide footprint" will show that a slight change in
course will easily clear the terrain.

There is also the case where known lift is available in the distance -
perhaps from good clouds or from radio chatter coming from other pilots.  If
this area isn't near an airport, list displays aren't useful.  With a glide
footprint it's easy to see when the lift is reachable.  Then there's
landable terrain that isn't in the airport database.  Just knowing that good
landout options are reachable reduces stress and allows the pilot to
concentrate on the task.

It answers at a glance the question of, "Where can I go from right here,
right now at the current McCready setting?"  For everyone who has watched a
simulation of a glide footprint display, there's a big "AHA!" moment.

Hi,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What is the advantage of a glide footprint to your soaring?
">

The programs I've seen determine reachable landing sites along a straight
line only. XCSoar can also show where that direct path would intersect
terrain (computed using a safety margin, so it is not really the point
of impact, but I like to think of it that way).

But it does so only for the current "goto" path, that is along the task set
or to a selected landing site.

The glide footprint simultaneously provides the same information for all
sites on the map.

Ideally it can also tell you wether you can reach a field by "flying
around a mountain" and escape routes when flying in mountains (Although
when I ever get that far in my training I hope to have them ready long
before I get to need them).

I have not checked the programs I tried for this. I suspect they just shoot
a few radials out from the current position and connect the intersections
with terrain they find that way for a closed footprint. A real pathfinding
algorithm sounds too computationally expensive to me.

The most useful thing for me is instant access to safety glide
information. By that I mean knowing what safe landing sites are in

knowing which way to divert, makes a huge difference to cross country

It doesn't have to be perfect to be a stress reducer! I always have a
good field in easy reach before I attempt to start; so far, only one
failure to start out of 165 in-flight restart attempts. That's a lot
less stress than 164 retrieves.

For a detailed look at how I use the "iron thermal" it's advantages for
the pursuit of soaring, read my "Guide" - see below for the download link.

I have compared GPS-LOG to SeeYou Mobile, and I am flying with GPS-LOG. It
gives me everything I need (X-country flying, no competitions) in a way I
like. It automatically switches between climb and cruise mode and displays
the relevant data for each mode without any need to touch the PDA. It gives
me the glide footprint on the map like discussed in another part of this
thread and AFAIK it was also the first PDA software to implement FLARM voice
warnings.

The only advantage I see in the commercial packages is the very easy
transfer of map and airspace from the desktop software (SeeYou -&gt;

It simply looks in 48 directions around the compass and computes the maximum
glide in each direction considering wind, polar, McCready, balast and bugs.
It terminates each glide at the 'safety altitude' you have selected.  It
then connects these glide termination points with a line that forms a 48
sided polygon.  It does this about once a minute.

Would a single mountain on a vast plane look like an island in the glide
footprint?

A single isolated mountain on a plain would be a "notch" in the polygon, not
an island.  If you know the terrain, it's obvious that you can glide around
the mountain and land in the notch on the other side.

I would also want a user-definable reserve height of maybe 500ft when I
got there.=20
especially as this is different from a final glide to a known landing
spot

ie consider wind, polar, mcready, balast, bugs and reserve height.

For those in the mountains, a computation that can cope with corners

Yes it does. 48 seemed like a good compromise between computation time

You are right about documentation. I will need to check in the code.
It may well be ZERO MC as it is a "safety" feature. If you are looking

I forgot to add in my previous post: If you really want to have "real
time" feedback in GPS_LOG for whether you can clear a mountain range
on course, you would not be looking at the GLIDE footprint, but at
forward looking terrain plot. This gives you glide path at your
current speed, wind... plotted with the ground profile. Got me through
several passes that I would have never attempted without that
information.
