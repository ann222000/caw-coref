THE FBI
AND INTERPOL

Should be very well acquainted with the monuments of evidence behind Karl
Rove, Joe Darby, Richard Hines,  and James Lay because these are the same
folks who make up the infamous DIXIE MAFIA.......One of the WORST TERRORIST
GROUPS ever INSIDE the UNITED STATES or OFF OF IT.........

Karl Rove and the BLOOD BROTHER BOYS FROM DIXIE RE-VISITED?
&quot; Your three blind mice are the kind of men that make these so called senior
politicians so proud of themselves. they hear Bill tell the world how
incredibly cool George is for riding the world of Saddam. Georges head must
swell every time he sees these guys on the tube feeding his ego. The support
he gets if from his Missouri criminal politican friends Bond, Blunt, and
Ashcroft. look who Karl Rove worked for in Missouri before joing George in
Texas. These fellows are from the Dixie Mafia and anyone who knows Missouri
history knows their Great Grand Fathers tried to succeed from Union and
Confederacy during civil war. They really believe that they are their own
goverment and country. The rest of us do not matter. I have spent seven
years learning of their trail and it is very repulsive. Some friends and
aquaintences of these men are some of the most deadly criminals in America.
Check out Missouri Boys State logs and see Rush, Wolf,the Blunts and more
are the key figures there too, wow do we want these men teaching our young
men politics?

Your three Blind mice have strings you see and they are controlled by what
Americas citizens really don't want to know.

Their might be lynch mobs started again as they find out the have meen
shammed.

Awesome response. I completely understand, he has also been linked to the
&quot;Skull and Bones&quot; society. Wikipedia has the basics,
It's a shame, and truly sad that our nation is so vastly uninformed, and
misinformed. If people didn't listen to the propaganda pushed forth by Fox
News, and other right-wing media, maybe we wouldn't be in the situations
that we are.&quot;

&quot;Billboards on the highways leading to town proclaim that Texarkana is TWICE
AS NICE because it is two cities in one, but half as nice might be more
accurate. An overgrown railroad junction and manufacturing town, it squats
on the state line where the north Texas plains lap at the Arkansas hills.
State Line Avenue, which divides the two Texarkanas, is a garish neon strip
with honky-tonks and liquor outlets on the Arkansas side facing fast-food
and, religious book stores on the dry Texas side. The region's wooded
terrain makes it an appealing hiding place for the so-called Dixie Mafia, a
loosely confederated band of car thieves, dope runners, hijackers and
assorted thugs who prey on towns across the South.

The Texas town (with a population of 34,000, v. 21,000 on the Arkansas side)
is also the scene of a Keystone Kops brawl between the county sheriff and
the district attorney, supported by the entrenched establishment. It might
be amusing if they were not playing with a hefty amount of U.S. taxpayers'
money.

The beleaguered sheriff is Earl Sabo, 48, a onetime security guard and a
relative newcomer to Texarkana. His troubles began in 1974 when one of the
town's leading attorneys, Harry Friedman, staged a country-music concert in
back of a nightclub he owned. Nervous state troopers moved in to make a
number of drug and liquor collars; Friedman's son was nailed on a driver's
license violation, and Friedman himself for interfering with a police
officer. Some troublemakers were tossed into Sabo's jail, and the sheriff
could not be located to approve bail for hours. In what Sabo claims was
retaliation, Bowie County District Attorney Lynn Cooksey, a friend of
Friedman's, ordered the arrest of a sheriffs deputy for carrying an
unauthorized weapon Cooksey later insisted that he had been unaware of the
gun toter's identity.

At about the same time, a joint Texas-Arkansas agency won a $77,000 grant
from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to monitor the area's
Dixie Mafia through an Organized Crime Intelligence Unit. Cooksey is one of
the unit's directors. OCI's achievements have been modest, to say the least.
Last year's major accomplishment, for example, was the confiscation of 225
lbs. of marijuana.

Shortly after Sabo won renomination in the May 1976 primary, he discovered a
black box under the fender of his patrol car. It turned out to be a
sophisticated $2,800 radio transmitter, a tracking device. That night, as
Sabo kept watch, a shadowy figure crept up to the patrol car. When the
interloper reached under the fender. Sabo jumped out and arrested one Gary
Morgan, an OCI investigator and the man Cooksey had utilized for
pre-election snooping into Sabo's background.

Morgan was promptly fired. OCI directors claimed he was acting &quot;individually
and without the authority or consent&quot; of the intelligence unit when he
planted the LEAA-funded device on Sabo. Morgan did not suffer: he quickly
landed a job as investigator for Friedman's law firm and was subsequently
appointed probation officer, another LEAA-created job. dispensed by local
judges.&quot; http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916034,00.html

&quot;John was the source of the crime scene photos of the late Florida
Department of Transportation investigator Ray Lemme, who was &quot;suicided&quot; in
Valdosta, Georgia after obtaining evidence of a link between the Jeb &amp;
George W. Bush, voter fraud, gambling money laundering through the Florida
turnpike toll system, and contract and electronic voting malfeasance
involving current Florida Rep. Tom Feeney. John has been a bane to the Bush
cartel for years. Last year, Caylor uncovered evidence of a shady Walton
County, Florida real estate deal cut by Karl Rove and real estate developers
who donated large sums of money to George W. and Jeb Bush.

Caylor was arrested for non-violently resisting an officer and disorderly
conduct and held for seven hours under bright lights in a concrete cell.
John, a heart patient, was shackled and forced to stand the entire time
while several corrections officers attempted to get John to hit them. John
reported that his detention amounted to &quot;torture&quot; under international and
U.S. law. Caylor resisted the attempts by guards to have him hit them. More
importantly, he was denied his nitro glycerin prescription pills needed for
his heart condition. Caylor is investigating a one-time CIA contract
sharpshooter who may have murdered a number of Bush family political enemies
in Florida and elsewhere over the years. He was attempting to retrieve old
court documents related to the case when he was arrested. Caylor also
described his treatment in jail as &quot;Guantanamo like.&quot;

John Caylor has been after the Bushes for years, yesterday it was payback
time.

He was released at 2:30 a.m. this morning and was denied a phone call during
his incarceration (which is permitted for 72 hours under Florida law). He
was originally told by county clerk officials that Florida's &quot;sunshine law&quot;
on public access to documents did not apply to the documents he was trying
to obtain. After stating that refusal to let him have the requested
documents was illegal, Caylor was told the documents would be made available
to him after they were reviewed by clerk officials. Caylor knew that was a
ruse and the critical documents would simply disappear. After protesting
that decision by the clerk officials, Caylor was arrested. Caylor reports
tonight that the entire government structure in Bay County (executive and
courts) is run by Bush loyalists who will do anything to protect Bush and
what Caylor has dubbed the &quot;Dixie Mafia&quot; -- a group of ne'er-do-wells and
roughnecks that goes back to the days of the Bay of Pigs, the illegal CIA
war in Angola, Iran-Contra, and now, the Iraq War rip-off.

John will undoubtedly rack up some legal expenses to defend himself from the
trumped up charges brought against him. Although WMR appreciates our readers
generous financial support, http://www.insider-magazine.com has a
contribution button if you'd like to help John. There may be a time when WMR
will require legal assistance also, but right now John, who is on
disability, is badly in need of it (either monetary or pro bono legal
assistance).

Postscript: News from our Texas sources also reports disturbing developments
and an attempt to silence an individual who is investigating Bush family
criminal dealings. One development involves the possible poisoning of a
critical source. The word from Houston is that the Bush-Cheney regime is
currently &quot;on the move.&quot; What that move entails is a major focus of WMR at
the present time. In the intelligence world, incidents like that which
occurred to John Caylor and the news from Houston are known as &quot;Indications
and Warnings.&quot; Right now, the I&amp;W looks extremely troubling.

One final note to the Bush crime cartel: You can't silence the media by
jailing and roughing up one journalist. There are thousands of non-corporate
and independent journalists around the country and the world who will
continue to ferret out your criminal deeds and see you brought to final
justice. That's not a threat but a promise.

June 15, 2006 -- The Chesapeake Bay is becoming to Washington, DC what the
Jersey Pine Barrens were for the New York and Philly mobs -- a place where
people simply disappear. The latest victim of the &quot;Chesapeake Triangle&quot; is
Philip Merrill, the publisher of the Annapolis-based Capital-Gazette
Newspapers (publisher of the Annapolis Capital and Maryland Gazette) and the
