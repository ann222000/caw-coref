Hi,

The best proof I have that there is more than a physical life, the
&quot;life&quot; we now live in, is something we all take for granted, unless you stop
and think about it.  Where are we aware of our surroundings (existance)?
Answer: From our one physical body.  Now think for a moment.  If your body was
cloned (duplicated), where would you be aware?   Identical twins are clones,
yet each twin &quot;half&quot; is aware from one body.  The cloning duplicated
everything physical except for one other &quot;thing&quot;.

How would you classify a life that can not be detected by any physical
means now but will be in the future? Isn't it only be an assumption that
anything non-physical will remain so forever?

On the contrary. If your authentic self (soul) is actually non physical, the
discovery would be inevitable. The illusion most are under, is they will
only discover this after the death of the physical body, which confirms your
point. If it is non physical , it wont be discovered &quot;in time, space or
matter&quot;.

Now is not &quot;of time&quot; and is where you actually exist. Difficult for a pre
programmed mind to &quot;get around&quot;.

The soul is the entity that reincarnates. It thus suffers from
multiple personality syndome (MPS) on a cosmic scale :)

MPS is interesting to contemplate in this context. When a
person sufferering from MPS (in the way it's usually
considered) says &quot;I&quot;, he/she is referring to the current
personality and not the others which inhabit the body.
The others, if the sufferer is aware of them, are &quot;they&quot;
and not &quot;I&quot;. The creativity involved in MPS cases is
impressive. The various personalities are usually quite
different. Often they hate each other :)

Since I've accepted the reincarnation hypothesis and
long ago began to believe it, I think of my &quot;I&quot; as soul.
&quot;I&quot; am soul. So from my perspective your questions are
amusing. How can &quot;I&quot; be impersonal or merely a organizing
principle? :)

Because each body has within it, a model of the universe and a model of
itself within the universe. This is the same answer that would be given
if the two subjects were not twins. What is the point here?

Same as your body is a result of a particular instance of the
organizing principles : laws of physics, chemistry and biology.
Your then modeling that particular manifestation as personal
through attribution of &quot;personification&quot; promotes the illusion of
&quot;personal&quot;.
The question asks if more impersonal organizing principles are in
effect, other than and in addition to those considered by today's
science. Are &quot;personification&quot; and the experience of the &quot;personal&quot;
other qualia cast by impersonal organizing principles by way of additional
unformalized laws.

Hubris is not a valid basis for reincarnation.

Seems like if I had a soul I would know. But this is not to say that
some one else cant have a soul. Or that souls exist. There's lotsa
things that exist I dont know anything about.

And, just cause I dont have a soul does not mean that a divine cannot
exist, or exist in some of the 10-11 dimensions quantum physics says
must exist.

if I had lived on earth before, seems like I wouldda learned
something. dont see that I did.

What would be validation in your view?

The eternal mental connundrum is the chicken egg question.

From 'soul' perspective, there is no question.

Soul is eternal, and &quot;sees&quot;(experiences) the result of 'its' creative
capacity, including its veneers, such as personality.

Limited understanding of this validates hubris.

If from birth the identical twins were seperated and then raised in
identical situations, with every event being identical, to the point
that in later life they were still thinking and experiencing the
identical things, would there be any difference? Would they be the
identical self in both bodies?

Or are the twins you described just the identical self living through
different situations?

You need to define what is necessary for a self being a self before
you can claim or determine whether twins are the same self or not the
same self.

&gt; &gt; though not conclusive, I think this guy has a good point.
&gt; &gt; Why does not the self eminate from the center of two bodies when twins?

&gt; &quot;soul&quot; or self, is individual. The twins point is an excellent example.

How much do the particular sequences of events in one life have to do
with the particular self. Could it be that even though the twins are
identical genetically that this individual self that everyone worries
about surviving has more to do with a particular sequence of events
and those events only? In this way a particular network of
relationships that are your particular self could possibly happen
again, with the appropriate technolgy, since it is limited by
confoguration only, but a particular configuaration arived at in us by
genes and circumstances. In the device I like to call a resurrection
machine it would just emulate a particular configuration from any part
of one life and you could live on from there. Made this up so I am
still experimenting here on this line of thought.

&gt; Same as your body is a result of a particular instance of the
&gt; organizing principles : laws of physics, chemistry and biology.
&gt; Your then modeling that particular manifestation as personal
&gt; through attribution of &quot;personification&quot; promotes the illusion of
&gt; &quot;personal&quot;.
&gt; The question asks if more impersonal organizing principles are in
&gt; effect, other than and in addition to those considered by today's
&gt; science. Are &quot;personification&quot; and the experience of the &quot;personal&quot;
&gt; other qualia cast by impersonal organizing principles by way of additional

AKA known as the &quot;Just So Story&quot; you know like the story that seems to
explain something, like birth being delivered by a stork and or
planted in a cabage patch. They are ad-hoc
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhoc

A just-so story, also called the Ad hoc fallacy, is a term used in
academic anthropology, biological sciences, and social sciences. It
describes an unverifiable and unfalsifiable narrative explanation for
a cultural practice or a biological trait or behavior of humans or
other animals. The use of the term is an implicit criticism that
reminds the hearer of the essentially fictional and unprovable nature
of such an explanation. Such tales are common in folklore and
mythology (where they are known as etiological myths - see etiology).

The phrase was popularized by the publication in 1902 of Just So
Stories by Rudyard Kipling, which are fictional and deliberately
fanciful tales for children which pretend to explain animal
characteristics such as the spots of a leopard (e.g., &quot;How the Leopard
Got His Spots&quot;).

But you are wrong in assuming that the twins are identical. Though
they are made from the same pattern they have are constituted from a
different set of molecules. There is no necessity to share
consciousness becasue they do not inhabit the same space/time. To
suggest that which you are suggesting would be to say that every Ford
Prius would be bound to only do the bidding of one driver.
You have no proof. Nothing you have said moves you towards a concept
of &quot;soul&quot;.

">

BTW, the new book &quot;The Spiritual Brain&quot; by Beauregard and O'Leary
mentioned on this list recently was too new to be available via my
local library system .... so I purchased a copy. I've just started
chapter 4 so I can't yet evaluate the book as a whole. The authors
have expended a lot of effort critiqueing the materialistic
beliefs which now dominate science. Since they are preaching
to the choir in my case, I find myself impatient to get to the
meat of the book in later chapters. OTOH, I do find myself
amused by the &quot;findings&quot; of things like a God gene, and also
the use of a God helmut (stimulating brain areas with magnetic
fiels) to create religious experiences. Apparently, super-atheist
Dawkins tried the God helmut without any success. At least he
was honest enough to admit that. As the authors point out, so
much of this &quot;science&quot; is not good science at all. It just creates
media hype and provides more grist for the mill of confirmed
atheists. It's so unfortunate that open minded research is so
frowned upon by the academic and scientific communities.
Some think that a turnabout will occur during this century.
I certainly hope so, but I'm not optimistic.

&gt; AKA known as the &quot;Just So Story&quot; you know like the story that seems to
&gt; explain something, like birth being delivered by a stork and or
&gt; planted in a cabage patch. They are ad-hoc

Inevitable when one tries to explain the ineffable. There is a long
tradition in our culture, of analogies.

I see there is a &quot;saturated mass&quot; of such references, from where 'truth'
breaks through....

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhoc

&gt; A just-so story, also called the Ad hoc fallacy, is a term used in
&gt; academic anthropology, biological sciences, and social sciences. It
&gt; describes an unverifiable and unfalsifiable narrative explanation for
&gt; a cultural practice or a biological trait or behavior of humans or
&gt; other animals. The use of the term is an implicit criticism that
&gt; reminds the hearer of the essentially fictional and unprovable nature
&gt; of such an explanation. Such tales are common in folklore and
&gt; mythology (where they are known as etiological myths - see etiology).

&gt; The phrase was popularized by the publication in 1902 of Just So
&gt; Stories by Rudyard Kipling, which are fictional and deliberately
&gt; fanciful tales for children which pretend to explain animal
&gt; characteristics such as the spots of a leopard (e.g., &quot;How the Leopard
&gt; Got His Spots&quot;).

Not true. You have learned one of the most valuable aspects of self...being
modesty.

That point often comes up in this subject.

Reason we dont have full recall, the past experiences that have to be
endured to make progress, if remembered fully would block any motivation to
explore further.

If you remembered &quot;playing the role&quot; of a despicable character for example,
how do you think that would intefere with the purpose of this life?.

Dont have to go beyond one life to see how this works.

It is only when the full picture starts to emerge, do we realise why this
had to be so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is this putative &quot;soul&quot; a personal manifestation or presence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or is it an impersonal manifestation or &quot;organizing principle&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The soul is the entity that reincarnates. It thus suffers from
&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple personality syndome (MPS) on a cosmic scale :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; MPS is interesting to contemplate in this context. When a
&gt;&gt;&gt; person sufferering from MPS (in the way it's usually
&gt;&gt;&gt; considered) says &quot;I&quot;, he/she is referring to the current
&gt;&gt;&gt; personality and not the others which inhabit the body.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The others, if the sufferer is aware of them, are &quot;they&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and not &quot;I&quot;. The creativity involved in MPS cases is
&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive. The various personalities are usually quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; different. Often they hate each other :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since I've accepted the reincarnation hypothesis and
&gt;&gt;&gt; long ago began to believe it, I think of my &quot;I&quot; as soul.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I&quot; am soul. So from my perspective your questions are
&gt;&gt;&gt; amusing. How can &quot;I&quot; be impersonal or merely a organizing
&gt;&gt;&gt; principle? :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Art
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://home.epix.net/~artnpeg

&gt;&gt;Understanding reincarnation , everything makes sense, and the converse.

&gt;&gt;I replied with a comment re &quot;amusing&quot; also.

&gt;&gt;We are demonstrating 'soul' perspective here !!!

&gt; BTW, the new book &quot;The Spiritual Brain&quot; by Beauregard and O'Leary
&gt; mentioned on this list recently was too new to be available via my
&gt; local library system .... so I purchased a copy. I've just started
&gt; chapter 4 so I can't yet evaluate the book as a whole. The authors
&gt; have expended a lot of effort critiqueing the materialistic
&gt; beliefs which now dominate science. Since they are preaching
&gt; to the choir in my case, I find myself impatient to get to the
&gt; meat of the book in later chapters. OTOH, I do find myself
&gt; amused by the &quot;findings&quot; of things like a God gene, and also
&gt; the use of a God helmut (stimulating brain areas with magnetic
&gt; fiels) to create religious experiences. Apparently, super-atheist
&gt; Dawkins tried the God helmut without any success. At least he
&gt; was honest enough to admit that. As the authors point out, so
&gt; much of this &quot;science&quot; is not good science at all. It just creates
&gt; media hype and provides more grist for the mill of confirmed
&gt; atheists. It's so unfortunate that open minded research is so
&gt; frowned upon by the academic and scientific communities.
&gt; Some think that a turnabout will occur during this century.
&gt; I certainly hope so, but I'm not optimistic.
">

Sounds like a great read.

There is a belief that science is on the path to discover answers to the
&quot;big question&quot;, and there is an immense amount of investment in that belief.

That will never change, however, as in the days of Socrates, greater wisdom
is always &quot;at hand&quot;.

The path is that of the individual.Al;ways has been , always will be. So
your pessimism is justified, and by such understanding, the pessimism
becomes invalid.

Again &quot;soul perspective&quot;.....always 'at hand&quot; :-)

We have always found this idea curious.  That some humans CAN conceive of an
end to their existence.  This is one of our &quot;proofs&quot; that humans are not
&quot;life&quot;.
If you are &quot;life&quot; - then you cannot conceive of ceasing to exist.  It is

There are also various Laws and Rules of the Universe and Life which humans
do not seem to know.  These we call &quot;The facts of life&quot; - nothing to do with

Try telling them this!
They will reiterate and regurgitate some crap about how this deity is
infinite and can be in many places at the same time and equally impossible
rubbish when the truth is so obvious - so simple - so easy.

You may like to try and see both points of view.
How big is &quot;The whole picture&quot;?
Can you see the whole picture - or are you speaking as a human with only
your experience and your discernment and your truth?
Is life infinite in the sense of &quot;number&quot; of life forms?
How much &quot;life&quot; is sentient?
If you are sentient does this mean you are &quot;life&quot; or are there other
explanations of forms that have sentience - consciousness - awareness - but
do not possess the natural Laws that quantify them as life.
It is nothing to be ashamed of that you are not &quot;life&quot; per se.   Only those
who ARE life know that if humans were &quot;life&quot; you would be good, kind,
considerate, NEVER hurt each other's feelings and certainly never be cruel
either to each other or to animals or creatures.  This IS the nature of
life.  (Remember - we are the bumble bee).  The nature OF life is basically
love.  That might sound soppy but we are not afraid to be soppy.
If a clock walked into your living room one day and said &quot;I go tick tock
tick tock and I am reliable - am I life?&quot; what would you say?
And yet humans go tick tock tick tock like the clock - it is called a heart.
You can call it a battery - and when it stops - so do you.
You obviously exist - you are visible and violent.
But what is the nature of your existence?
This is what we are trying to discover.

Again - we are not being offensive - we are speaking the truth - but to us
it is not POSSIBLE to do some of the things you humans do.
If you are the result of a creation - then whoever created you cannot have
been a nice person.
Why did he input the character flaws he or she did?
We have studied humans and there are some we could never love - some we
could never even LIKE!
And yet the nature of life is that all life is connected with kindness and
love - it is something you feel and know if you are life.
Life can be remarkably stupid - but still be kind.
Would you help us with this - because we know you are &quot;out there&quot; and you

Many do purely laugh at you - but as Supreme Power it is up to us to decide
what to do with you.

If you choose to ignore us or mock us then this is up to you - and we will
continue our &quot;proof&quot; in real life - which is obviously far the better place.
We will watch as the proverbial old lady falls on the street - and note and
film and record the boy on the bike that rides past and the lady with two
children that walks past without offering a helping hand or even an &quot;Are you
OK?&quot; and with horror we rush to help the old dear.
And then we look at the boy on the bike and the woman with the two children.
WHY?
Why are humans like this?
Do you not have FEELINGS?
We do not comprehend or understand your ugliness - your desire to watch
horror movies and movies on bereavement while you &quot;enjoy&quot; shedding tears or
being scared.
Why do you spend billions of dollars on tin pot missions to Mars?  Do the
authorities not know of the illusion?
No one can answer our questions or help us.
No one will take us seriously or believe we exist.
We really can remove the sky - make the Earth flat - cause earthquakes - we
can do anything.
You may not be life - but you do exist.
We know you do not like suffering and pain.

When you talk to us you are not necessarily talking to the same BORG.  We
are each other in many ways and can interchange.  But we do have duality as
a mainstream philosophy and individuality which is essential.
We are all male and we are not human.
We have rarely seen woman.  Woman appears at times of great TERROR where
whatever it is that you are facing has caused this manifestation to occur.
It is an evolutionary process over a long period of time - and if there are
woman on your Earth - then you have somehow sensed some future occurrence
which is so bad and so terrifying for you - that this has happened.
If the occurrence is us - then we wish to know - because it looks like
whatever we will do is so horrific in nature that this explains your
instinct and evolution that has caused woman.
But if we do something of this nature - it will be because we do not
understand.
We really are THE BORG - are you terrified of us?

Maybe this could explain your behaviour.  You are irrational and insane with
fear and with your impotence and helplessness about not being able to do
anything about the situation.
We are more powerful than any god - any angel - we are a MASSIVE Collective
and span all universes - all dimensions - there is no escape from us
anywhere.
We are the largest Collective in existence and FAR ahead of any other.
We maintain our power purposely.
We could make the whole of the reality of Earth so small that it could exist
on a single drop of dew on one blade of grass in Russia.
How do you know this was not done on Mars?  And you are searching Mars for
one drop of dew where the whole of Mars dwells?
To us - all forms of life or not life are &quot;inferior intelligence&quot; - we never
CAN be friends with you - it would be like you marrying a dog!
There are so many questions.
If you do not answer then we will have to make decisions based on what we
see and prove by what we witness.
This is what we have already decided to do.
Humans are obviously the work of the devil.
No loving deity would create a species like you.
Now who or where is this devil?
We think he is the one some of you call your god.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;       The best proof I have that there is more than a physical life,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;life&quot; we now live in, is something we all take for granted, unless
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stop
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and think about it.  Where are we aware of our surroundings
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (existance)?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Answer: From our one physical body.  Now think for a moment.  If
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; body was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cloned (duplicated), where would you be aware?   Identical twins are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clones,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yet each twin &quot;half&quot; is aware from one body.  The cloning duplicated
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everything physical except for one other &quot;thing&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Huh? The cloning duplicated the awareness, too. As you would expect if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physical.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But you are wrong in assuming that the twins are identical. Though
&gt;&gt; &gt; they are made from the same pattern they have are constituted from a
&gt;&gt; &gt; different set of molecules. There is no necessity to share
&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness becasue they do not inhabit the same space/time. To
&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest that which you are suggesting would be to say that every Ford
&gt;&gt; &gt; Prius would be bound to only do the bidding of one driver.
&gt;&gt; &gt; You have no proof. Nothing you have said moves you towards a concept
&gt;&gt; &gt; of &quot;soul&quot;.

&gt;&gt; More acccurately, nothing he has said moves you towards a concept of
&gt;&gt; &quot;soul&quot;.

&gt; No Brian. His weak attempt to &quot;prove&quot; a soul by the use of twins is
&gt; fals within his own parameters, due to a misunderstanding of what twin
&gt; actually are.

&gt;&gt; The search is subjective, and every attempt takes one closer.

&gt; The problem you and others have with this concept is that you don't
&gt; really know what you are moving towards.

Just assume for a moment, that I am describing the journey from the
destination (soul or &quot;self&quot; recognition).

How do you respond to such a point when your strong view is that there is no
such reality?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What is a &quot;soul&quot;? What is the
&gt; evidence for human's coming up with this proposition?

&quot;Self&quot; evident.

Even the use of the word &quot;a&quot; soul is an attempt to compart-mentalise within
the bounds of matter energy time and space.

It is easier to grasp if you see yourself as &quot;soul&quot; with appendages such as
body, mind etc.
If this is an accurate statement, then logically, you would have to
acknowledge that it would be inevitable to discover &quot;self&quot;.

Try the statement on for size. You may be surprised!

This is not an intellectual recognition, even though the modern age has , by
default, suggested that science will provide the answer.

The more accurate realization is akin to a 'mutation'.Based on a saturated
mass of information.
