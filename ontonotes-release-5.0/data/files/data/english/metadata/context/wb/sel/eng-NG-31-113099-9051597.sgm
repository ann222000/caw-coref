Protocol #4 - Materialism to Replace Religion

1.  Every republic passes through several stages.  The first of these is the
early days of mad raging by the blind mob, tossed here and there, to and
fro.  The second is demagogy which leads to anarchy and that inevitably
leads to despotism.  This is not a legal and observable, and therefore
responsible, type of despotism.  Rather it's a hidden form of despotism that's
in the hands of some secret organization.  This organization is unscrupulous
because it works behind the backs of the people using agents who have no
accountability, and who don't serve the people, only the organization.
These agents are continually changing and this benefits the organization
because it doesn't have give them special rewards for long times in service.

2.  Who or what has the ability to overthrow an invisible force?  Because
that is precisely what our Force is.  Gentile-based Freemasonry serves as a
smokescreen for us and our plans.  But the plan of action of our Force, even
its very existence, remains an unknown mystery to the people.

We Shall Destroy God

3.  Even freedom might be harmless and have its place in our State economy
without harming the well-being of the people if it is based on a faith in
God and on the brotherhood of humanity - providing that it remains
disconnected with the concept of equality.  Equality is negated by the very
laws of creation, for these laws have established subordination.

With faith such as this, a people might be governed by a trusteeship of
parishes, and would walk contentedly and humbly under the guiding hand of
its spiritual pastor while submitting to the plans of God upon earth.

This is the reason why it is essential for us to undermine all faith, to
tear out of the mind of the Goyim and the principle of 'God the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit', and to put in its place arithmetical calculations
and material needs.

4.  In order to give the Goyim no time to think and notice what is
happening, their minds must be diverted towards industry and trade.  Thus,
all the nations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and, in the race
for it, they won't notice their common enemy.

But again, in order that freedom may once and for all disintegrate, and ruin
the communities of the Goyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis.
The result of this will be that the wealth which is mined from the earth
will not be invested in productive industry, but will pass to institutions
that deal in speculation (finance gambling), which are under our ownership.

5.  The intensified struggle for superiority and the shocks delivered to
economic life will create, no, have already created, disenchanted, cold and
heartless communities.

Such communities will lose interest in, and foster a strong aversion toward
sound political management and religion. Their only guide will be that of
monetary gain, i.e. Gold, which they will erect into a bona fide cult for
the sake of those material delights which it can give.

Then a day of reckoning will come when, not for the sake of righteousness,
not even to win wealth, but solely out of hatred towards those privileged,
the lower classes of the Goyim will follow our lead and rise against our
rivals for power: the intellectuals of the Goyim.

Top of Protocols

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Protocol #5 - Despotism and Modern Progress

1.  What form of administrative rule can be given to communities in which
corruption has penetrated everywhere; communities where riches are obtained
only by the clever surprise tactics of con artists; where looseness reigns;
where morality is maintained, not by voluntarily accepted principles, but by
harsh laws and strong enforcement; where feelings towards religion and
country are obligated only by fashionable persuasions?

What form of rule is to be given to these communities other than that
despotism which I shall describe to you later?  We shall create a strong
central government in order to gain a stranglehold on those communities.

We shall thoroughly regulate all aspects of the public life of our subjects
with new laws.

These laws will withdraw, one by one, all the privileges and freedoms which
have been permitted to the Goyim; and our kingdom will be distinguished by a
despotism of such magnificent proportions that, at any moment and in every
place, it will be in a position to wipe out any Goyim who dares to oppose
us, either in words or by actions.

2.  You may think that for a despotism of this description to come into
being, it would not be consistent with the progress of history, and that it
could not exist in this modern age.  But I will prove to you that it is, and
that it could.

3.  Back in the days when the peoples looked at kings on their thrones, just
as they would look upon a pure manifestation of the will of God, they
submitted without a murmur to the despotic power of kings.  But from the day
when we placed the concept of their own rights into their minds they began
to regard the occupants of thrones as mere ordinary mortals.

The god-like charm of the Lord's Anointed has fallen from the heads of kings
in the eyes of the people.  And when we also robbed them of their faith in
God, the might of authoritative power fell into the realm of public
ownership, and was then seized by us.

Masses Led By Lies

4.  Moreover, the art of directing masses and individuals by means of
cleverly manipulated theory and words, by laws, and by all sorts of other
odd methods: the Goyim understand none of this because it belongs to the
specialists of our collective governing intelligence.

Reared on analysis, observation, and delicate calculations: in this type of
skill we have no rivals, any more than we have rivals in the drawing up of
plans of political actions and solidarity.  In this respect the Roman
Catholic Church might have compared with us, but we have conspired to
discredit them in the eyes of the unthinking mob since they are an
observable organization, while we ourselves have kept our secret
organization in the shade the whole time.

However, it is probably all the same to the world, which doesn't really care
who its sovereign lord is: whether the head of Catholicism or our despot of
the blood of Zion!

But to us, the Chosen People, it is very far from being a matter of
indifference.

5.  For a time perhaps, we might be successfully dealt with by a coalition
of the Goyim of the entire world.  But we are protected from this danger by
the discord existing among them.  Their loyalties to their own separate
groups, races and classes are now so deeply ingrained that they can never be
removed.

We have set one against another: the personal and national beliefs of the
Goyim, religious and race hatreds, which we have fostered into a huge growth
in the course of the past twenty centuries.

This is the reason why there is not one State which would anywhere receive
support if it were to raise its arm, for every one of them must bear in mind
that any agreement against us would be unprofitable to itself.  We are too
strong - there is no evading our power.

The nations cannot come to even an inconsiderable private agreement without
our secretly having a hand in it.

6.  &quot;Per me Reges regnant&quot; is Latin for: &quot;It is through me that Kings
reign.&quot;  And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God Himself
to rule over the whole earth.  God has endowed us with genius so that we may
do this task.

If genius was in an opposing camp it would still struggle against us, but
even so, a newcomer is no match for the old-established settler: the
struggle would be merciless between us, such a fight as the world has never
seen.

Yes, and the genius on their side would have arrived too late.  All the
wheels of the machinery of all States go via the force of the engine, which
is in our hands.  And that engine of the machinery of States is - Gold.

The science of political economy invented by our learned elders has placed
great value on the importance of money-capital for such a long time.

Monopoly Capital

7.  Capital, if it is to function without limitations, must be free to
establish a monopoly of industry and trade.  This is already being put into
place by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world.

This freedom will give political strength to those engaged in industry, and
that will help us to oppress the people.  Nowadays it is more important to
disarm the peoples than to lead them into war.  If those people have a
passion that has suddenly 'burst into flames', it more important to use it
to our advantage than it is to quench it.  Finally, it more important to
eradicate them.

The principle goal of our directors consists of this: to weaken the public
mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections which may arouse
calculated resistance; and to distract the forces of the mind towards
meaningless fights.

8.  Throughout history the people of the world have accepted campaign
promises at face value. Those people are content with a show and rarely
pause to check afterward whether the promises have been kept.  The same
holds true for individuals outside the political arena.

Therefore we shall establish 'Show' institutions which will give eloquent
'proof' of their benefit to progress.

9.  We shall assume to ourselves to represent the voice of freedom of all
parties, of all directions, and we shall make our representative be a voice
in orators who will speak so much that they will exhaust the patience of
their hearers and bring about a hatred of oratory.

10.  In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a
state of bewilderment by broadcasting so many contradictory opinions from
all sides and for such a long time that it will make the Goyim lose their
heads in a maze of confusion.  They will come
