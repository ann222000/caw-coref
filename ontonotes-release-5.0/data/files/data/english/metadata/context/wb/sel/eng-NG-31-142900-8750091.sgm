August 4th - St. John Baptist Vianney

Today is the feast day of the Curé of Ars, confessor, intercessor for the
Clergy's sanctification and model for those entrusted with the care of
souls. He
lived in the 19th century (1786-1859).

Comments of the late Prof. Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira: (died 1995)

There is always a word to say about St. John Baptist Vianney because he was
one
of the greatest saints of the 19th century. His life presents so many
different
facets that one always can take new lessons from it.

In the first decades of the 19th century, he was a poor seminarian. Not only
was
he poor but he had a small intelligence, remarkably small. He had to make an
extraordinary effort to follow his studies at the seminary, and twice failed
the
examinations required before ordination. His intellectual insufficiency gave
much cause for concern about his priestly vocation. Finally at age 30 he
barely
managed to complete the course and was ordained.

The Bishop sent this dull priest to a tiny village in the south of France,
the
village of Ars. There he began his sacerdotal life, which would permeate all
of
Europe with its light, and, from there, spread throughout the world. He was
canonized a saint by Pius XI in 1925 and proclaimed patron of parish
priests.

What was it that distinguished this Saint? Even though he didn't have any
natural qualities to make him an exceptional priest, he became a magnificent
priest, an extraordinary apostle, a confessor with rare discernment, and a
preacher who exercised a profound influence over souls.

What was the reason for such efficiency? St. Therese of Lisieux used to say,
&quot;For love, nothing is impossible.&quot; What this means is that one who truly
loves
God, Our Lord and Our Lady will obtain the means to do what Divine
Providence
calls him to do. This applies perfectly to St. John Vianney. For example,
let us
look at his preaching. He became an extraordinary preacher. He prepared his
sermons the best he could, then he studied them. They were not sermons
touching
on the highest topics of theology; they were common catechetical
instructions
for the people. But when he taught, he spoke with such conviction, with such
a
great love of God, with words so blessed that the graces of those sermons
were
communicative and touched all who heard them.

A defect I still didn't mention: he had a weak voice, and in those happy
times
when microphones didn't exist, the multitudes that gathered to listen his
preaching - filling the church of Ars and its environs - often could not
hear
him. Even though persons at a distance could only hear a few loose phrases
of
his sermons, many of them still converted. Others could not hear him at all,
but
they also converted, only from the effect of seeing him.

In his Soul of the Apostolate, Dom Chautard relates this telling fact. An
impious lawyer went to Ars to mock its unlearned Curé. But he returned
converted. Someone asked him: What did you see there? He answered: &quot;I saw
God in
a man.&quot; That is, the presence of God was in St. John Vianney. One could note
that God was with him and in him. I consider the witness of this impious
lawyer
about the Curé of Ars - &quot;I saw God in a man&quot; - one of the most glorious
homages
a man can receive.

The blessings from his sermons and charisma of his words extended far and
wide,
and all over Europe pilgrimages started to be made to Ars. This was one of
the
reasons for the countless conversions St. John Vianney made.

He was also a martyr of the confessionary. He used to spend hours and hours
there hearing confessions and giving counsels. We don't realize the
tremendous
penance it represents to spend long hours hearing the foul moral things
people
do. In the confessionary he applied the advice of St. Alphonse of Ligouri to
not
hurry through the confession, to be patient, to consider each penitent as if
he
were the only person to be heard and to help him conquer each one of his
sins.
So he entered battle against each sin, insisted on the practice of virtue,
advised good behavior, and often he denied absolution. Yes, if he could not
note
a serious intent of amendment, he denied absolution to that person.

He was an enemy of dancing. You should note that the dances of that time
were
far different from the immoral and outrageous dances of today. The young
ladies
were completely covered and had skirts that reached to the floor. If he
condemned those dances, what would he say about ours? His condemnation went
so
far as to deny absolution to those who would not promise to stop going to
such
dances.. Many persons would go to other churches to receive absolution.
Hearing
this, he simply commented: If other priests want to send them to Hell, it is
up
to them.

This extraordinary Saint spent all his time in the church: at the pulpit,
confessionary or altar. At night when he returned to his house, one might
think
he would at least get a deserved rest. But no, a new fight started, this
time
against the devil. For decades he fought a nightly battle with the devil -
whom
he called Grapin - in which the devil physically assaulted him and tormented
him
with deafening noises and insulting words. On the night before a person
particularly dominated by the devil would come to confess to St. John
Vianney,
the devil would inflict stronger torments on the Saint. Once he set fire to
the
Curé's bed. In response St. John Vianney used to increase his special
penances,
flagellations, and prayers to win the graces for his words to effect the
needed
conversions.

It is beautiful to consider that Divine Providence, in order to further
increase
his apostolate, gave him the gift of the miracles. In fact he worked many
miracles. But he did not attribute them to himself. In his church he built a
shrine to St. Philomena, a virgin martyr that Paul VI removed from the list
of
the saints. St. John Vianney did not think the same way, and attributed all
his
miracles to her.

I will mention just one extraordinary fact that reveals his gift of reading
souls - the discernment of spirits - that he had. This fact was reported by
one
of his penitents, a young lady who was a Daughter of Mary. She went to
confession to the Curé of Ars. After she knelt, he began to tell her events
from
her past life.

- Do you remember that you went to a ball on such-and-such occasion?
- Yes, I remember.
- Do you remember that at a certain moment a handsome young man entered
the
ballroom. He was quite elegant, appeared very upright and danced with
several
young ladies?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you recall that you had a great desire to dance with him?
- I recall that.
- Do you recollect that you became sad because he didn't ask you to
dance?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you remember that by chance you looked down at his feet and saw a
strange blue light coming from them?
- Yes. I remember.

Until now, everything he described to the young lady came from his gift of
discernment, because naturally he knew nothing of her past. Then, he made
the
astonishing revelation:

- That young man was none other than the devil who had taken that shape
to
tempt several of the young women there. He was unable to approach you
because
you are a Daughter of Mary protected by her, and you were wearing the
Miraculous
Medal.

The fact is rich in lessons. It also explains the extraordinary fame that
spread
because of episodes like this - for he used to read the souls of many such
penitents who came to him for confession - throughout the environs of the
small
village of Ars, then all of France, Europe and the whole world.

Saint Quote
If people would do for God what they do for the world, what a great number
of
Christians would go to Heaven.
-Saint John Vianney

Bible Quote:
Holy Father, keep in Thy Name those whom Thou hast given Me, that they may
be
one even as We are. ( John 17:11)

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
Jesus! my Lord, my God, my All! How can I love Thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift, So far surpassing hope or thought?

Had I but Mary's sinless heart To love Thee with, my dearest King!
O, with what bursts of fervent praise Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing!
Sweet Sacrament! We Thee adore! O, make us love Thee more and more!

F. Faber: Corpus Christi. (19th cent.)
