PACKERS HOST EAGLES TO OPEN 89TH SEASON
-Green Bay kicks off its 89th season in franchise history Sunday - its
87th as a member of the National Football League - by welcoming the
Philadelphia Eagles to historic Lambeau Field.

-The Packers are 47-36-3 (.564) all-time in season openers but have
lost three of their last four.

-Green Bay opens its season at home for the second consecutive season.
The Packers have lost their first game at Lambeau Field each of the
last four seasons.

-Sunday marks the beginning of a year-long celebration honoring the
50th anniversary of the opening of Lambeau Field. The NFL's longest-
tenured facility, only Boston's Fenway Park (1912) and Chicago's
Wrigley Field (1914) have hosted their respective teams for a longer
uninterrupted period.

-The Packers and Eagles have met five times over the past four
seasons, including an NFC Divisional Playoff game in 2003, with
Philadelphia earning the win in each of the five contests.

-Coming off an 8-8 season, the Packers narrowly missed the playoffs by
virtue of a tiebreaker. Had the percentage points fallen in its favor,
Green Bay would have traveled to Philadelphia for the NFC Wild Card
Playoffs.

ALL ABOUT MOMENTUM
-The momentum of four straight victories to close the 2006 season -
coupled with missing the NFC's final playoff berth by mere percentage
points - produced record attendance in the offseason program and one
of the most competitive training camps to date.

-Only defending Super Bowl champion Indianapolis (5) enters 2007 with
a longer winning streak than the Packers.

-Of the 22 players who started in the 2006 season finale at Chicago,
19 return to the team in 2007.

YOUTH WILL BE SERVED
-The youngest team in the NFL in 2006, the Green Bay Packers remain
among the youngest teams in pro football this season.

-Since taking over general manager duties in 2005, Ted Thompson has
vowed to build the team's foundation through the draft. Of the 53
active roster players, 20 have been drafted by Thompson.

-Only Indianapolis enters 2007 with a younger squad. A look at the
five youngest teams in the NFL reveals that youth will be no excuse in
2007 - all five teams finished .500 or better in 2006.

Team, Average Age
Indianapolis - 26 yrs, 87 days
Green Bay - 26 yrs, 92 days
N.Y. Giants - 26 yrs, 193 days
Dallas - 26 yrs, 193 days
Jacksonville - 26 yrs, 236 days

ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY
-65 of the 109 living Medal of Honor recipients arrived Monday in
Green Bay for their annual conference.

-Those who have been honored with the highest military decoration
awarded by the United States will participate in a series of
activities around the Fox Valley area, culminating in a pregame
ceremony on Lambeau Field Sunday.

WITH?THE?CALL
-FOX Sports enters its 14th season as an NFL network television
partner and will air the contest to a regional audience. Play-by-play
man Kenny Albert joins color commentator Daryl Johnston in the
broadcast booth with Tony Siragusa serving as the sideline analyst.

-Milwaukee's WTMJ (620 AM), airing Green Bay games since 1929, heads
up the 56-station Packers Radio Network, with Wayne Larivee (play-by-
play) and two-time Packers Pro Bowler Larry McCarren (color) calling
