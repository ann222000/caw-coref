Few, if any, books have had as great an impact on the history of
thought on the nature of human consciousness as John Locke's Essay
Concerning Human Understanding (1690). Hardly a book on the subject is
written in England from the time of its publication through the
Romantic period which does not respond in some way to Locke's text.
The text itself is a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the
mechanisms of human thought. An analysis which Locke believed had the
potential to shed new light on social and religious thought. In the
course of the book, Locke himself attempts to use his model to explain
many philosophical dilemmas, such as the relationship between the
material world, subjectivity and the divine. The books most sustained
influence on British thought was, however, not a result of his
philosophizing about these relationships, but rather of his initial
impetus to categorize and describe the relationship between various
types of human thought. It is the nature of of the model of cognition
that Locke developes which lead John Stuart Mill, for example, to dub
him the "unquestioned founder of the analytic philosophy of mind."
Many later British thinkers would disagree with Locke, but few would
be able to refrain from constructing their own cognitive models as
justifications for their social, aesthetic, or religious philosophies
in the face of the weight of the Influence of Locke's Essay....

I've just read some of the essay (in abridged form, in /The Age of
Enlightenment/, Isaiah Berlin, Mentor, 1956); and I've come to the
conclusion that, as far as the dead-ending of philosophy pre-Kant, the
empiricists are just as culpable as the rationalists.

Here's Berlin's assessment of the /Essay/, fully supported by the
textual evidence:

"Sensitive knowledge is, within Locke's frame of reference, simply not
knowledge.[...]   The gravest objection to Locke's account of
knowledge is that, by his own definition, all knowledge is only of the
relations of *ideas* on our minds.  How then can we be sure that any
of our knowledge is knowledge of the real world?  Does it even make
sense to ask how we could find out whether our knowlede is applied to
anything beyond our ideas?  or what it means to say that there is such
a 'beyond'?  Locke, by his representationalism, has finally trapped
human knowledge within the circle of the human mind."  (106-107)

The straight line leading to Berkeley, and then to Hume, becomes
obvious.

All my reading in the history of philosophy these past months has
vastly increased my symathy for both Immanual Kant and Ayn Rand - wrt
Kant, by showing the tangled legacy he was faced with integrating into
a consistent philosophy; wrt Rand, by revealing some of the truth
behind the cartoon version of that history that she gave us in /For
the New Intellectual/.

So true, and the also the only theory of cognition
in all of human history that ever fell so far, so fast,
and so so mathematically as after the true scientific
Discovery of  DNA-RNA was made.

Hardly a book on the subject is
