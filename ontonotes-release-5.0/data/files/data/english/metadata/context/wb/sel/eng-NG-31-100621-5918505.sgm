I am thinking about switching my service from Verizon to Cingular and wanted
to know if Cingular is better than Verizon Wireless?? I live in an area in
Northern Kentucky ( 20 miles south of Florence, KY) where Verizon dose not
really work. I go from 2 bars to nothing ( No service) very rapid in my
home. Verizon dose not work that good when you go south of Florence, KY and
you age not near a major city in Kentucky. VZW service is very poor in
Kentucky. I looked at both service coverage maps VZW and Cingular and
Cingular is more favorable. Better Coverage. I am also looking in getting
the Cingular 3125 smart phone. Dose any one have this phone or thinking
about getting this phone real soon?

Also dose Cingular have a service where you can play video clips like news,
weather, sports, ect like Verizon Wireless has with the V-Cast service?

Best thing to do is ask or neighbors, friend, co-workers etc about their
cell service in the areas you are likely to use the phone. They all
provide trial periods too.

Kentucky is one of the very, very few places where Cingular is as good or
better than Verizon.

Your statement is not true! There are areas where Cingular provides better
service than Verizon. If Verizon doesn't provide adequate coverage in your
area, then any cell service that provides acceptable service is better than
Verizon in that area. In my area, Sprint is better because Verizon doesn't
provide adequate service. Get the idea? The best thing to do is talk to
friends that live in the area and invite them to your home so that you can
try their cell phones.

&gt; In what way?

&gt; Verizon service with a full digital/analog phone is far, far superior to
&gt; Cingular service in just about every way.

&gt; I say that having Cingular service, and having friends with Verizon
&gt; service.

&gt; Regarding customer service, I have no idea.

I had a tri-band Verizon phone before switching to Sprint because Verizon
couldn't provide service in my area. Verizon also will not roam on Sprint in
my area. One good thing that I can say about Verizon is that they sent a
technician out to my area to perform a signal analysis. They found that the
signal at my home was inadequate and decided the let me out of my contract.
I then switched to Sprint. YMMV, and therefore there is no best cell phone
provider. The best cell phone provider is the one that works well at your
home, work, and the areas that you travel. Does that make sense?

&gt; Do you have a Verizon tri-band phone?  Have you tried one?

&gt; Probably not.

It is alleged that Viper claimed:

Then I'd say that it's likely that Cingular will work better for you.
Go here: http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/ to get an approximation of
your expected service level.  T-Mobile and Cingular have similar
footprints, I found the above map to be reasonably accurate for my
Cingular coverage in North-Central MA.  What I like about the above map
is that it shows estimated signal strength at the street level details
taking topography into account, not merely the theoretical level based
on a flat mapping of where the towers are.

I assume you mean "tri-mode" since there are only two bands currently in
use in the USA.

While I'd agree that a Verizon tri-mode phone gives better coverage
nationwide than anything Cingular offers, there are still individual
areas where Cingular has better coverage than Verizon, and no matter how
much you may hate Cingular doesn't change that fact.

Similarly, I'd be the first to admit that of the main national carriers,
T-Mobile has the worst coverage overall.  Despite that, they have the
strongest signal of any carrier in my neighborhood.
