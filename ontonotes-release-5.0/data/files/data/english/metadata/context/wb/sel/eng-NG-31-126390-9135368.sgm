Apple IIe emulator card (in Mac LC III) question
</HEADLINE>

This question is probably more of a Mac question since it involves a
Mac LC but it is also an Apple II question since I am trying to get an
Apple 2 emulator to run, so it is posted in both groups.

I have an Apple IIe emulator card which I plugged into my old Mac LC
III and it booted.

Next I downloaded the accompanying Apple IIe program and unstuffed it
to the Mac's desktop.

When I try to run it I get an error message:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;To use the Apple IIe card you must turn 32-bit addressing off in the Memory control panel.
">

I opened the memory control panel and turned off 32 bit addressing. A
message is displayed saying 32 bit addressing will be off after
reboot.

However, after reboot, 32 bit addressing is back on and I can't run
the emulator.

Can anyone suggest how to get this working?

Thanks

I've got a working LCIII with a //e card so I'll try to help.

First off - can you tell me about your LC - how much memory to do you
have?

What operating system are you using?  I use 7.5.3  - Anything above
7.6 won't let you turn off 32 bit addressing.

Is it a pretty stock system or do you have a lot of extensions and
control panels?

What I'm wondering is if another extension or control panel that you
have requires 32 bit addressing and it is turning it on?

Other things to try - change the load order of the memory control
panel - put a space in front of it to have it load early - or a tilde
or similar character to have it load later.

Is your battery ok?  It might not be remembering the settings if it's
dead.

Do you the floppies to reinstall the OS on the Mac?

Complementing the stated OS version requirements:  I can verify that
you cannot turn it off on OS 7.6.1.  I have a 7.5.5 partition that I
use when I need to run the IIe card.  I have not tried 7.6.

Thanks to everyone for your replies... I am pretty sure I'll have to
replace the battery, I haven't changed it in 10 yrs or so!

The OS may also be the problem. I remember my friend who I got the
machine from updated the OS ... I am not sure if it is 7.5.x or 7.6, I
will have to check when I get home.
After he updated the OS, the startup screen went from this

to this

There are a lot of extensions and control panels as well.

I do have the install disks for System 7.1 (as well as System 6) and
might want to install an earlier version for the emulator. If I need
to roll back the OS to an earlier version, can someone point me to
directions to setting up a separate boot partition on the machine like
below?

A Macintosh is NOT a PC, you don't have to have seperate boot partitions.

As long as the version of the System can read the disk, you can share
it with other versions. Back in the day that you needed a seperate
system for non Latin alphabets, I know people that had 4 or 5
different systems on the same hard drive.

The problems occur because System 6, 7, 7.1 and 7.5 had different
size limitations for hard drives.

Before you do anything make a backup of your hard drive. Then install
&quot;system switcher&quot; or Blesser (system switcher is better).

Boot from a floppy and rename the system folder on your hard
drive. You can call it &quot;System 7.5&quot;, or what ever as long as it
is not &quot;system&quot; (case does not matter).

Install your second version of the System. If you are told that
the installer will delete the current system, quit and rename it.
If that still does not work, copy it to another partition or disk
and copy it back after the install.

Install the new system. Reboot from the floppy and rename it.
Then run system picker and pick the one you want.

Note that there are occasional problems with preferences stored
in NVRAM instead of the system folder. In order to make things
work properly, I have to remove the ethernet drivers (I was
getting AppleTalk conflicts) on my SE which has System 6,
7.0, 7.1 and 7.5 on the same drive.
