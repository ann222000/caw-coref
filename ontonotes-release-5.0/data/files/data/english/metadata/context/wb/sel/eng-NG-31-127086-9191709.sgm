Drug-Seeking 101

http://paynehertz.blogspot.com/2007/09/drug-seeking-101.html

In this video, &quot;Nurse Bob&quot; shows drug-seekers what they need to do to
score drugs in the ER. I can't tell whether he's being serious or just
joking, maybe he's just trying to be ironic, but I think there are a
few lessons for people with real chronic pain in this video because it
says a lot about how we are perceived when we come into an ER or
doctor's office complaining of pain. He also illustrates a certain
behavior many people with cp have that can exacerbate chronic pain.

In the video, Nurse Bob shows you how to get in and out of a chair if
you want to be taken seriously by ER staff. I have seen many people
with chronic back pain over the years and they do tend to get in and
out of chairs like this and I have an interesting story that shows why
that's a bad idea.

I have a friend who I met in a chronic pain support group whose primary
problem is (or was) severe upper back pain. She had struggled for years
with it, went to PT, multiple doctors and had multiple tests done, and
of course when they couldn't find anything wrong told her it was all in
her head, was the result of repressed anger, stop exaggerating your
pain...da da da, da da da. One of the most difficult things for her was
getting in and out of chairs, which was extremely painful, and a lot of
times it would take multiple attempts for her to get out of a chair,
which was painful to watch. She used to lift herself out of her chair
with her arms by grabbing the armrests just as Nurse Bob demonstrates
in the video.

One day, we had a Feldenkrais practitioner come and give a lecture to
our group, and she observed the way my friend got in and out of chairs.
Turns out that lifting yourself out of a chair like that is extremely
inefficient mechanically, as you are literally lifting almost your
entire body weight with your arms, in an extremely awkward position,
and then trying to stand up from this position. This places enormous
strain on your upper back which can lead to chronic pain problems. The
instructor showed my friend the proper way to get out of a chair, which
is not to lift yourself slowly with your arms, but to lean forward,
placing your center of gravity over your knees while placing your hands
on your knees, and then lift yourself up using your legs, rather than
your arms, in one smooth motion, maintaining forward momentum as you do
so. Your arms should play little role in lifting you up. My friend
began to practice getting out of a chair like this, and within three
weeks the chronic pain problem she had had for years was gone, and she
hasn't had problems since. After all those years of seeing the
&quot;experts&quot; at doctor's offices and PTs, no one ever noticed that the way
she got out of chairs was extremely problematic, even though difficulty
getting out of chairs was her primary complaint in addition to pain. If
Nurse Bob is right, if she had gotten out of chairs correctly her pain
may have been dismissed.

The moral of the story here is that doctors and PTs don't know
everything, and you really need to be proactive and educate yourself
about all the alternatives and be aware of factors that can perpetuate
or cause your pain. Don't just wait for some doctor to find the answer
for you, but engage in a little &quot;solution-seeking&quot; behavior.

Secondly, there is the issue of chronic vs. acute pain. Nurse Bob is
correct when he says that doctors and nurses are more suspicious of
people who've had pain for a long time than someone who just injured
his back moving something heavy. You see this all the time in ER blogs,
with doctors complaining of people with chronic pain as opposed to
acute pain coming to the ER, as they figure you should have had enough
time by now to find a physician to help you, and if you are coming to
the ER, it is either because you were too lazy to look for a primary
care doctor, or you just got fired by a doctor for a drug abuse issue.
The possibility you might have a severe acute exacerbation of your
chronic pain escapes many of them, so if you're ever forced to go to
the ER, you might want to emphasize that the pain your are dealing with
is a lot worse than usual and be specific if there is a causative
factor, like you slip and fell.

Either way, they don't look too kindly on cp'ers in the ER, so the best
advice here is to avoid the ER like the plague if you have cp, unless
you simply can't take the pain. Try and find a pain specialist who
understands pain, is not a shot jockey (does nothing but injections)
and hopefully can see you in a timely manner. Having a good primary
care is important too as you need someone to orchestrate all your
treatments, because we do get sick from other things, as well.

Finally, there is the issue of keeping it simple. Nurse Bob's advice to
drug-seekers is to claim a back injury and don't rehash a litany of
symptoms like abdominal pain or headaches. Unfortunately, this advice
applies to us, as well. Many doctors have difficulty with the idea that
you can have more than one thing wrong with you at a time, and if you
have multiple chronic pain problems, it confuses the hell out of them
and they don't know where to begin. But many of us do in fact have
complex problems and we want solutions to all those problems, and not
just one of them, so this is a real dilemma. I have a very complex cp
problem, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen a doctor's eyes
glaze over, and then they shake their heads and stop me as I'm
explaining what's wrong with me. I've learned to keep it simple. Many
doctors can't handle complexity, which is why they reach for simplistic
explanations of complex problems, like &quot;psych case,&quot; or &quot;drug-seeker.&quot;

If you have multiple chronic pain problems, but are in the ER because
you just slipped and re-injured your back, try to keep the focus on
your back and don't go into excruciating detail about everything that's
wrong with you. If you need treatment for everything that's wrong with
you, try to find a doctor who can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Even with a sympathetic and competent physician, you might want to
compartmentalize your problems, and deal with specific pain issues one
at time with your doctor rather than throwing them at him in one shot.

I don't think Nurse Bob's intent is to encourage drug-seeking. He is
simply acknowledging the reality that drug-seekers exist, and is trying
to streamline the process of dealing with them to make it easier for
all parties concerned. It is a purely pragmatic approach. We too have
to acknowledge reality, and must learn what is expected of us by
doctors, what attitudes or behaviors can make or break our medical
care, and adjust our behaviors accordingly. Doing so is not
manipulative, nor is it a surrender to the unfairness of this system,
or acquiescence to the abuses we so often encounter. It is simply
dealing with reality, and that's the real lesson you should get from
Nurse Bob's video.
