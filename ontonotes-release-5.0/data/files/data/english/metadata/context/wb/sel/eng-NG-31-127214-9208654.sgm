If they go 3-13, yes

If they can beat teams with a winning record and have a winning record
themselves, no

Right now they do not look remotely close to fulfilling the post-draft
optimism and pre-season hype

I did actually pick them to win today in my pool

Yes. But we're not going to beat the Steelers. Not with that offense.

There are some on this list that would still be complaining if the
unimaginable happened this year and the Niners won the Superbowl.

For once you've said something which is approaching correct, it IS
unimaginable that they will win the Superbowl based on how they've
performed so far

i wonder, if the Niners go 10-6 (lord, wouldn't that be nice) and New Orleans
goes 5-11, will people still insist that the Saints are a better team? granted,
the Saints played the World Champs on opening night, but they played Tampa Bay
this week, which no one thinks is a team of the ages.

the Niners are a work in progress, but as a Ninerhead, i'm quite pleased with
2-0. :)

most sincerely,

GodBuilt

Correct is an absolute not a relative value.  As with other posts where you
have corrected me, it is getting funny that in almost all of your posts to
me that you make errors in your reading, grammar, correct word choice.  Then
you eventually tell me that I need to learn to read.

By the way, you have done an excellent job of changing the context and
meaning of my most recent post on this thread.

No, I show you are factually wrong, I point out your factual mistakes

See, getting the facts right when reading is more important than the
grammatical nonsense you CLAIM to see

Still waiting for your QB comparisons to Smith..............

So then, are you now saying that you are corrector than I or is it that you
are the correctest?

Sydney, take a couple of breaths.  Now try to enjoy the Niners being 2-0,
being in first place, and being on a three game winning streak.  Is that not
a cool feeling?  There are plenty of nit-picking arguments to get into with
someone else whose education and temperament so inclines them.

Please put Sydney in your killfile and stop being his yo-yo. He, and others
like him, populate every NFL newsgroup. OMG, we had a bad 1st quarter, fire
the coach, cut the starting QB and start over.

Please believe me, they are not worth your time. Also, by you quoting him,
those of us who killfiled him long ago must once again read his drivel.

Sorry, I'll try to remember that but I do not use the killfile so it may
inadvertently happen again.  Playing with trolls is a nasty game, but
sometimes I just cannot help myself.  If we go 3-0 next weekend I may not be
able to resist my guilty pleasure.

2-0 is great, but we certainly aren't. but i don't give a shit how we beat
Pitt, let's just do it. Style points are so 80's and to be left to the Pats
and Colts of the league!!!
