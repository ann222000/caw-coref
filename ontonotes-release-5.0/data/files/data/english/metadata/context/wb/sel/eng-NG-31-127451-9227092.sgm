Christopher Booker's Notebook
By Christopher Booker
Last Updated: 1:48am GMT 25/11/2007

We are set on a course of 'planet saving' madness

The scare over global warming, and our politicians' response to it, is
becoming ever more bizarre. On the one hand we have the United
Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change coming up with yet
another of its notoriously politicised reports, hyping up the scare by
claiming that world surface temperatures have been higher in 11 of the
past 12 years (1995-2006) than ever previously recorded.

This carefully ignores the latest US satellite figures showing
temperatures having fallen since 1998, declining in 2007 to a 1983
level - not to mention the newly revised figures for US surface
temperatures showing that the 1930s had four of the 10 warmest years
of the past century, with the hottest year of all being not 1998, as
was previously claimed, but 1934.

advertisementOn the other hand, we had Gordon Brown last week, in his
&quot;first major speech on climate change&quot;, airily committing his own and
future governments to achieving a 60 per cent reduction in carbon
emissions by 2050 - which is rather like prime minister Salisbury at
the end of Queen Victoria's reign trying to commit Winston Churchill's
government to achieving some wholly impossible goal in the middle of
the Second World War.

Mr Brown's only concrete proposal for reaching this absurd target
seems to be his plan to ban plastic bags, whatever they have to do
with global warming (while his government also plans a near-doubling
of flights out of Heathrow).

But of course he is no longer his own master in such fantasy
exercises. Few people have yet really taken on board the mind-blowing
scale of all the &quot;planet-saving&quot; measures to which we are now
committed by the European Union.

By 2020 we will have to generate 20 per cent of our electricity from
&quot;renewables&quot;. At present the figure is four per cent (most of it
generated by hydro-electric schemes and methane gas from landfill).

As Whitehall officials privately briefed ministers in August, there is
no way Britain can begin to meet such a fanciful target (even if the
Government manages to ram through another 30,000 largely useless wind
turbines).

Another EU directive commits us to deriving 10 per cent of our
transport fuel from &quot;biofuels&quot; by 2020. This would take up pretty well
all the farmland we currently use to grow food (at a time when world
grain prices have doubled in six months and we are already face a
global food shortage).

Then by 2009, thanks to a mad gesture by Mr Blair and his EU
colleagues last March, we also face the prospect of a total ban on
incandescent light bulbs.

This compulsory switch to low-energy bulbs, apart from condemning us
to live in uglier homes under eye-straining light, is in practice
completely out of the question, because, according to our Government's
own figures, more than half Britain's domestic light fittings cannot
take them.

This year will be remembered for two things.

First, it was the year when the scientific data showed that the cosmic
scare over global warming may well turn out to be just that - yet
another vastly inflated scare.

Second, it was the year when the hysteria generated by all the bogus
science behind this scare finally drove those who rule over us,
including Gordon &quot;Plastic Bags&quot; Brown, wholly out of their wits.

Billions of MoD spending is off target

The great row over under-funding of our forces in Iraq and
Afghanistan, led in the Lords by five former Chiefs of the Defence
Staff, has so far missed a hugely important part of the story,
although it was hinted at by General Sir Mike Jackson when he was
interviewed on the Today programme.

Alas, John Humphrys failed to pick up the significance of Jackson's
observation that &quot;we may not have enough to do the things which we do
now and the things which we may have to do in the future&quot;.

The problem with our defence spending in recent years is not that the
Ministry of Defence has been starved of cash. On the contrary, it has
been earmarking colossal sums for projects designed to equip us to
fight imaginary wars in the future, as part of the European Rapid
Reaction Force to which Tony Blair and Geoff Hoon committed us around
2000: £20 billion on the Navy's two giant carriers (with planes and
infrastructure); £16 billion on FRES, a new family of vehicles for the
Army; not to mention the £20 billion already committed to Eurofighters
for the RAF.

It was the diversion of resources into planning for that imaginary
future that took the eyes of the MoD and the then-Chief of the Defence
Staff off the need to equip our forces adequately for the totally
different type of insurgency war they have actually been having to
fight.

The MoD is belatedly trying to make amends for this disastrous
blunder, for instance equipping our troops with properly mine-
protected Mastiffs, instead of the unprotected Snatch Land Rovers that
have caused so many deaths. It may also help that enthusiasm for the
EU's fantasy armed forces of the future has been on the wane.

But no one at the time shared that enthusiasm more obviously (or was
happier to send those hopelessly inadequate Land Rovers to Iraq) than
the officer who was then Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Mike
Jackson.

Schools minister neglects homework

Desmond Swayne, MP for New Forest West, tells me of a fearful problem
affecting Hampshire schools, which have been told by the county
education officer, Ian Beacham, that under new rules teachers must no
longer drive pupils in mini-buses unless they have a full &quot;passenger
vehicle licence&quot; - &quot;a huge and expensive undertaking which entitles
them to drive a coach or bus&quot;.

Threatening many extra-curricular activities, such as away sporting
fixtures, this is causing such grief that Mr Swayne has asked in
Parliament whether it is right that teachers should be forbidden to
drive children in this way.

Schools minister Jim Knight didn't know the answer but said he would
look into it. Harriet Harman, Leader of the House, suggested that Mr
Swayne should move for a debate on the issue.

Had those ministers or Hampshire's education officer learned to use
Google, they might have found in seconds that this is all a fuss about
nothing. The two relevant EU directives on driving licences, 91/439
and 2003/59, make clear that teachers are exempted from the licensing
requirements, as does a leaflet available at the click of a mouse on
the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency website.

But does it not say something about the way we now allow our laws to
be made in Brussels that neither ministers nor a council official
responsible for enforcing them appear to know what those laws say?

* On October 19, 1999 I reported here a remarkable &quot;personal message&quot;
sent out to Britain's small businesses over the signature of Nick
Montagu, then head of the Inland Revenue Board. He told them how
&quot;exciting and important&quot; it was for him and his staff to be &quot;at the
forefront of implementing the new Labour Government's policy agenda&quot;.

How apt, in light of the mega-grief they are currently causing the
Government, that eight years later our incompetent tax-gatherers
appear to be playing such a significant part in New Labour's impending
downfall.

According to NASA
http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd06oct97_1.htm ,

I find this:

&quot; Unlike the surface-based temperatures, global temperature measurements of
the Earth's lower atmosphere obtained from satellites reveal no definitive
warming trend over the past two decades. The slight trend that is in the
data actually appears to be downward. The largest fluctuations in the
satellite temperature data are not from any man-made activity, but from
natural phenomena such as large volcanic eruptions from Mt. Pinatubo, and
from El Niño. So the programs which model global warming in a computer say
the temperature of the Earth's lower atmosphere should be going up markedly,
but actual measurements of the temperature of the lower atmosphere reveal no
such pronounced activity.&quot;

Will that do, Mike?

Very well, it's the first response you've made to a GW post that you
don't bag on Al Gore!

some questions.

Did you read the whole article (from 1997)?

Do you think that this article refutes anthroprogenic warming?   Why or why
not?

Do you think that climate is simple or very complex?   Would you expect a
global
warming trend would equally warm every spot on earth, and every level of
the atmosphere, or heat some places more, other places less, and perhaps
even
cool some areas?

Do you think the data from this study is included in the climate
science that predicts the warming, refuted by it, or ignored by it?

If you are expecting me to explain climate sciences to you, you will
still be ignorant about it when I'm done!    Climate Science is an enormous
body of work spanning a dozen different scientific disciplines.

There are a dozen different atmospheric measurments made at differing
atmospheric levels using many different techniques  and tools.

This article described a newer measurment tool of the lower atmosphere that
obtained results that scientists didn't expect, happens all the time!!!

That's the best answer you can give in this case.

Google is a good way to find things that support your POV.     It's not
obvious that that data was ignored by Climate Science, there's really
a host of articles out in climate science will show how that data got used
if you want to look a little.

You realize, of course, that the argument you make is exactly the same
argument made by creationists to 'refute' evolution.    They will hunt in
the
sciences for yet-unexplained evolutionary mechanisms, or for controversy
among scientists about the process and  point to one or more of those
single data points as refuting evolution itself, and as proof that it's not
happening.

It's dishonest by the Creationist people, don't you think?

That's because the analysis you are talking about was done
incorrectly.  When correctly analyzed the satellite data supports the
global warming models.

Here are links to recent analysis (as opposed to links posted by the
deniers, to analysis over 10 years old)

http://www.ucar.edu/communications/newsreleases/2003/wigley2.html
http://www.livescience.com/environment/050811_global_warming.html

Since the clicker on your mouse seems to be broken, I've taken the
liberty (below) of quoting the following for you:

------------------------------------
In order to glean temperatures from the raw satellite data, several
adjustments and corrections must be made. Until now, only one group,
based at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), had produced a
complete set of global temperatures from the raw data.

For the new study, a group based at Remote Sensing Systems in Santa
Rosa, California, applied a revised set of corrections to the
satellite data. These corrections accounted for the effects of heating
on the radiation sensor itself--the first time this source of error had
been addressed fully, according to the authors--as well as new
adjustments for the drifting orbit of each satellite and other
factors.

The group found a warming trend of 0.16°F per decade in the layer
between about 1.5 and 7.5 miles high, compared to a trend of 0.02°F in
the previously published UAH analysis. Both estimates have a margin of
error of nearly 0.2°F (plus or minus). According to the authors, the
new results are a closer match with surface warming, as well as with
four computer-model simulations of 20th-century climate produced by
NCAR and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

-------------------------------------------

Global warming is real.  Refusing to deal with the problem is morally
Reprehensible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This carefully ignores the latest US satellite figures showing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;temperatures having fallen since 1998, declining in 2007 to a 1983
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;level - not to mention the newly revised figures for US surface
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;temperatures showing that the 1930s had four of the 10 warmest years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the past century, with the hottest year of all being not 1998, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was previously claimed, but 1934.

&gt; snip

&gt;&gt;&gt; some questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you read the whole article (from 1997)?

&gt;&gt; nope. You asked for some science regarding the satelite data we have that
&gt;&gt; shows that the globe has actually cooled a little.

&gt;&gt; So I found it. (shrug) I was just curious to see if the article, or the
&gt;&gt; OP, pulled this data out of pure aether or not. I guess not (or maybe...I
&gt;&gt; guess they did, depending on your POV.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you think that this article refutes anthroprogenic warming?   Why or
&gt;&gt;&gt; why not?

&gt;&gt; I have no idea. I didn't read it. I simply did a quick google search to
&gt;&gt; see if the data were there. (shrug)

&gt; I figured, that's why I asked the questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you think that climate is simple or very complex?   Would you expect
&gt;&gt;&gt; a global
&gt;&gt;&gt; warming trend would equally warm every spot on earth, and every level of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the atmosphere, or heat some places more, other places less, and perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt; even
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool some areas?

&gt;&gt; Interesting question...brings up a thought; if we are talking about
&gt;&gt; global warming being hard to measure, etc., which would be a more
&gt;&gt; accurate measure of temperature, local measurements ON the planet, or the
&gt;&gt; sort collected by satelites, which, arguably, would be more, well,
&gt;&gt; global?

&gt; If you are expecting me to explain climate sciences to you, you will
&gt; still be ignorant about it when I'm done!    Climate Science is an
&gt; enormous
&gt; body of work spanning a dozen different scientific disciplines.
">

Perhaps, but my question was a simple one. I don't think it requires a
complete knowledge of all the parameters of climate science to answer it.
Indeed, my own first blush assumption would be that if we are concerned
about GLOBAL warming, then going to measuring instruments that deal with the
globe as a whole would be a more appropriate step than going to regional
measurements.

(shrug) but that's just me. It's also a question (one I don't know the
answer to) of whether satelite measurements truly are 'global' in nature, or
whether they are simply measurements of larger regions.

Hmmn. Come to think of it, it seems reasonable to assume that temperature
measurements of larger regions would be more useful in predicting climate
change than those of smaller ones, but, hey, feel free to educate me on why
that might not be true.

It's a rather obvious red herring, don't you think? We aren't talking about

We do indeed deal with excessive heat--air conditioners and skimpy
clothing, and excessive cold--heaters and thicker, more insulating
clothing.  The use of heaters and warm clothing has kept millions of
people alive for millenia.  People and other mammals are much more
vulnerable to cold than to heat.  We have worked hard to keep from
dying from cold.  Heat doesn't cause death on even remotely the same
scale.  Same for most animals.  There is a term for the world when it
is warmer than it is now:  &quot;Climate Optimum&quot; (e.g.,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period )

And of course it would be morally reprehensible to let one's children
die of cold or heat, or starvation or other deprivation caused by the
devastating economic downturn that would inevitably follow if we were
to curtail the use of fossil fuels as prescribed by the global warming
nut jobs.  Those who propose &quot;solutions&quot; to phantom problems (Stalin,
Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, GW alarmists) and cause greater harm than good
are criminal.

Hi, John Guynn (apologist for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints)

Yes.  Climate changes naturally.  And it's a fact that natural climate
changes in the past have followed natural fluctuations in greenhouse
gases.  The two are highly correlated.

But the earth doesn't discriminate between man-induced greenhouse
gases and those that happen naturally.  Consequently, when people
double the concentration of key greenhouse gases they drive climate
change, just the way microbes have driven climate change in the past
when they increased the concentration of greenhouse gases.

The fact you'd spout such nonsense within the context of a discussion

Terrestrial measurements span a much longer time span and show

The point about the satellite data is that it does support GW (says so

Global warming means just that - warming of the entire globe, not just certain
regions - a net increase in total surface caloric energy on a planetary scale.
How do you measure that accurately?  The earth's surface is approximately 510
million square kilometers.  If you measured temperatures using only one data
point every 10,000 square kilometers, it would take 51,000 equidistant data
points.  Your measuring equipment would need to be both accurate and precise to,
say, 0.5 +/- .05 degrees Celsius.  You would have to keep precise records for
every one of the 51,000 temperature stations with sufficient frequency over a
long enough time, say once a week for 50 years, to accurately show a trend.
Approximately 70% of the earth's surface is ocean.  That means 70% of the
temperature measurements would have to be over the ocean.  How many air
temperature stations actually exist for the part of the earth's surface covered
by water?  Also, the oceans represent one humongous thermal sink.  Therefore,
global temperature measurements must also measure changes in the overall caloric
content of the oceans, which would require a similar planetary water temperature
measurement grid.  Maybe someone has taken those measurements, but I rather
doubt it, because if they had, we would see some summaries of actual data rather
than projections based on computer models of questionable accuracy.  Has
anything of the sort been done?  Have any surface temperatures ever been tracked
on a global, as opposed to a merely regional, scale?

I have yet to see a cogent, reasoned argument supported by verifiable facts that
a little global warming would not be a good thing.  Can you convince me a net
planetary temperature increase of 2-3 degrees Celsius would be bad on a
planetary scale?

I am also unpersuaded that if GW is occurring, there is anything mankind can do,
short of ending all dependence on fossil-fuel based energy production, that
would have any meaningful effect.  What effect would THAT have on civilization
as we know it?

The so-called &quot;cure&quot; I see many alarmists urge is morally reprehensible.  The
simple fact is, the Kyoto accord, or other similar measures, is a joke.
IF GW is real, and IF GW is caused by mankind, our contribution is ultimately
caused by using coal, oil and natural gas to meet our energy needs.
If it was necessary to stop the use of fossil fuels in order to stop GW, the
result could be hundreds of milllions, perhaps billions, of people dying of
starvation, disease, and other causes now avoidable because of our energy
dependence, and the retreat of civilization from a world-wide industrial society
to pre-industrial revolution levels, including a mere handful of bastions of
civilization scattered among thousands of isolated agrarian societies.  There's
no evidence whatever that a little GW on a planetary scale would, over the long
term, be a bad thing.  In other words, there's no evidence that GW if it exists
is even a problem, yet alone one that should be dealt with using drastic
measures that would threaten modern civilization as we know it.

________________

In order to glean temperatures from the raw satellite data, several
adjustments and corrections must be made. Until now, only one group,
based at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), had produced a
complete set of global temperatures from the raw data.

For the new study, a group based at Remote Sensing Systems in Santa
Rosa, California, applied a revised set of corrections to the
satellite data. These corrections accounted for the effects of heating
on the radiation sensor itself--the first time this source of error had
been addressed fully, according to the authors--as well as new
adjustments for the drifting orbit of each satellite and other
factors.

The nice thing about science is that you don't need to believe

&gt;&gt; If you are expecting me to explain climate sciences to you, you will

&gt; Perhaps, but my question was a simple one. I don't think it requires a
&gt; complete knowledge of all the parameters of climate science to answer it.
&gt; Indeed, my own first blush assumption would be that if we are concerned
&gt; about GLOBAL warming, then going to measuring instruments that deal with
&gt; the globe as a whole would be a more appropriate step than going to
&gt; regional measurements.

&gt; (shrug) but that's just me. It's also a question (one I don't know the
&gt; answer to) of whether satelite measurements truly are 'global' in nature,
&gt; or whether they are simply measurements of larger regions.

&gt; Hmmn. Come to think of it, it seems reasonable to assume that temperature
&gt; measurements of larger regions would be more useful in predicting climate
&gt; change than those of smaller ones, but, hey, feel free to educate me on

Duwayne already pointed you to some links that you can
go read and learn about it.

That's what I do.    I read mainstream mags like New Scientist
and Science that has really interesting articles that are understandable
by slobs like me, then contain links to the primary papers that generate
the summary.     I don't have time to read every issue or certainly
every article, but I do look for climate science articles and I also
look for brain research.

If you are truly curious about the depth and breadth of climate
science, where it's been and where it's going,  wikipedia is a nice place
to get an overview on it, then follow some of the links.    It
even has links to the deniers.

Duwayne explained it very well.   I pointed out to you that if you

The comparison is valid though.  I know that you accept evolution

of science.     You are welcome to overturn either one by
analyzsing the vast amounts of data and come up with better
explanations than current theories and models for either one and
publishing it in a journal.

The dishonesty of the GW deniers is made of the same cloth as
the dishonesty of the creationists who will pick and choose among
little pieces of the data and valid controversies within the science itself
to try to discredit the entire body of work.

I think you are pretending an open mind w/ GW, but it doesn't look
like you  are willing to do the homework to learn about it.

&lt;snip&gt;

To &quot;accept evolution&gt; a person has to know what it is, and Diana
clearly doesn't.

Bret recently posted this wonderful article with regard to Mormons who
supposedly accept evolution, and some of the implications.  I wonder
if Diana would respond to Bret's comments?

Repeat post from Bret:

[In the interest of full disclosure: I don't really want to talk
about
evolution, per se.  Rather, I'm hoping to use evolution as a starting
point
to discuss some of the diverse doctrinal views that may exist among
(non-TBM?) Mormons.  My experience is admittedly limited, but I'm
under the
impression that LDS views on doctrinal matters are much more diverse
in RL
than what we see presented by TBMs (and perhaps even more so by their
critics) here on ARM.  Either my impression is false, I am flat out
misunderstanding TBMs, or for whatever reason non-TBM Mormons are
under-represented (or simply less vocal) on ARM than in real life.]

The following three observations recently collided in my head:

1) The LDS concept of God differs from that of traditional Xians in
that
the LDS description of God includes a physical body of flesh and
bone.

2) I've met several Mormons who believe in evolution.

3) Some Mormons who believe in evolution have suggested that
&quot;evolution&quot;
and the doctrine of &quot;eternal progression&quot; are compatible concepts.

Now, it strikes me that this physical aspect of God may present some
odd
possibilities, and (apparently for no other reason than to give myself
a
headache) I tried to imagine just how evolution and eternal
progression
could work together /physically/.

IIUC, a rather important ramification of the doctrine of eternal
progression is that man can become god.  For LDS who believe in
evolution,
is the potential for godhood limited only to Homo sapiens sapiens? If
so,
why?  Are/were other hominids also potential gods?  What sorts of
possible
reasons exist that, say, Homo sapiens idaltu was incapable of
achieving
godhood?  Or Homo neanderthalensis?  Maybe there's even a specimen of
A.
afarensis out there somewhere that is now a god of his/her own
universe.
According to LDS theology, these gods would presumably have physical
forms
of flesh and bone.  Would the A. afarensis god resemble A. afarensis,
or
would she get a free pass to another point on some evolutionary
branch?  If
not, I should imagine it could lead to some awkward moments in the
event
the god's sentient population evolved in a different sort of direction
(and
by &quot;awkward&quot; I mean something along the lines of &quot;I am the God of
Abraham,
and of Isaac, and of Jacob&quot; issuing from the lips of, say, Lancelot
Link.)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot_Link

But what about the god of our universe?  From the perspective of LDS
evolutionists, why /should/ he resemble Homo sapiens sapiens?  Or does
he
simply choose an appearance suitable for his audience?

BTW, if God can choose his own physical appearance, I don't understand
why
he'd choose to be human, anyway.  Why not take on a form with
something
really useful, like wings?  Or gills?  Or maybe a prehensile tail?  I
hope
I never become a god, but if I do I should almost certainly insist
upon
wings and a prehensile tail.

OK, that did get a bit silly; but I think all I'm doing is dancing
around
some valid questions about possible attributes of a physical god who
is
responsible for creating (&quot;in his image&quot;) creatures who will evolve /
are
evolving, and who is himself the product of evolutionary processes.
Do any
LDS believers in evolution have opinions or thoughtful speculations
regarding why, how, or even whether God indeed has a human-like body?
Was
it inevitable that evolution on earth would produce Homo sapiens
sapiens?
Did God guide evolution to produce species that would resemble
himself?  Or
is God's &quot;human&quot; appearance simply a convenient sort of affectation,
with
his &quot;real&quot; physical body being unknown?

I think I already know the &quot;official&quot; answer to these questions
(insofar as
they deserve answers at all): &quot;it hasn't been revealed&quot;.  And I'm
prepared
to take that as read.  But I'm not looking for any authoritative
answers,
here.  I am interested in learning some (presumably non-TBM) LDS
perspectives on the nature of God, and perhaps some nuanced views on
eternal progression regardless of whether or not these have anything
to do
with evolution.  Again, I'm just trying to use evolution as a
starting
point to discuss different ways in which Mormons understand Mormon
teachings or doctrine.

BTW: if any of my above observations/assumptions are faulty, please
feel
free to bust me.  I hope to learn something, here, and just by setting
me
straight you'll be doing me a favor.

If you want to be more specific, it would be bad if the aggregate negative
impact on humankind exceeded the aggregate positive impact on humankind.  For
example, a net increase in edible agricultural production would be a good thing,
while a net increase in mortality rates would be a bad thing, and a shift of
productive arable land from one location to another, without knowing more
specifics, would be neutral, i.e., neither good nor bad.

BTW, your link to utah.edu says the makers of the report say they express no
opinion on whether GW would be good or bad for Utah.

Here's a similar problem.  Suppose you wanted to know how many
protozoa live in a pond.  Do you need to count every last one of them
to get a reasonably accurate answer?

When I was a kid in junior high school we had this assignment.  We
took samples from the edge of the pond, near the middle, and at
various depths.  Then we took a tiny drop from each sample and counted
the number in a very small (smaller than a drop) volume.  We
extrapolated up, averaged (and weighted) the results and calculated an
estimate for the entire pond.

How might similar sampling techniques be used to estimate global
average temperature?

I don't know of any evidence that would prove GW is &quot;bad&quot; using your
definition, or any evidence that would prove it's not (again, using
your definition).

But I think your definition of &quot;bad&quot; is very different from the one
I'd use.  I'd consider GW &quot;bad&quot; if it caused the extinction of
species.  I think it would be bad if it caused migrations of millions
of people, even if those migrations did not cause a *net* movement;
especially if the impact was disproportionately born by poor countries/
people.  I think it could be bad if it displaced agricultural
production, even if there was no net change, for the simple reason
that massive movement of agricultural centers is disruptive -- and
disruptive processes are not neutral.

I also think you're argument is logically flawed.  One need not
*prove* that GW would be &quot;bad&quot; to conclude that it's immoral to risk
&quot;bad&quot; things that others will have to pay for.  For example, if there
is a 10% chance that GW will cause significant &quot;bad&quot; things to happen,
and the people who are going to have to pay for those &quot;bad&quot; things
won't be born for 20 or 50 years, then I think it's morally
reprehensible to make them take the risk by doing nothing about GW.

In other words, the burden of proof is really on the GW deniers.  You
need to prove that no really &quot;bad&quot; things will happen.  If you cannot
prove that, then you are assigning risk to others for your actions,
and forcing them to bear the burden of your choices.  And I think
that's wrong.

There's actually a quantitative way to deal with this -- it's called
&quot;game theory&quot; and it's a branch of mathematics.  You can use it to
find the optimum strategy of a whole host of situations and responses.

Here's a link where researchers applied it (within the context of
economic theory) to Global Warming:

I disagree.  Scientists need only show that GW has a reasonable chance
of happening and of having significant global repercussions on future
inhabitants of the world.

At that point we have a moral obligation (in my opinion) not to ask
future generations to pay for our &quot;live in the moment&quot; and &quot;take no
thought of the future&quot; attitude.

But on that we simply have different moral standards, as you've made
it clear that you have no qualms about asking future generations to
live with the consequences of GW.

Well, at least it's immoral if you drive your car without being
covered by auto insurance!

Actually, buying insurance is a good example of how people not only
should, but do spend money even when the risk is small.  Auto
insurance might cost, say, $1,000 each year.  That's a fair chunk of
change to protect against the consequences of a pretty unlikely event.

Similarly, once we have pretty good evidence that GW is happening,
will continue to get worse, and is at least partially caused by
people, we have a moral and *economic* obligation to mitigate the
risks -- just as we have a moral and economic obligation to buy auto
insurance if we're going to drive.

Ignoring GW and its possible consequences is morally and ethically
equivalent to driving without auto insurance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact you'd spout such nonsense within the context of a discussion

&gt; &gt; I notice you snipped the best part of what I said, which demonstrated

&gt; &gt; remind you what I really said:

&gt; &gt; &quot;The use of heaters and warm clothing has kept millions of
&gt; &gt; people alive for millenia.  People and other mammals are much more
&gt; &gt; vulnerable to cold than to heat.  We have worked hard to keep from

&gt; &gt; scale.  Same for most animals.  There is a term for the world when it
&gt; &gt; is warmer than it is now:  &quot;Climate Optimum&quot; (e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period )

&gt; The problem with global warming isn't so much that people will die
&gt; from the heat (though people do die from the heat).  The problem is
&gt; more related to shifting weather patterns.

&gt; &gt; And of course it would be morally reprehensible to let one's children
&gt; &gt; die of cold or heat, or starvation or other deprivation caused by the
&gt; &gt; devastating economic downturn that would inevitably follow if we were
&gt; &gt; to curtail the use of fossil fuels as prescribed by the global
&gt; &gt; warming
&gt; &gt; nut jobs.

&gt; Explain exactly why you think an &quot;economic downturn&quot; would be
&gt; &quot;inevitable&quot; if we switch from fossil fuels to carbon-neutral fuels.
">

Can you name a &quot;carbon neutral fuel&quot;?  And don't say &quot;biofuels&quot;
because they are anything but &quot;carbon neutral&quot; and actually harm the

purchasing insurance, there is really no estimated cost of &quot;fixing&quot;

Hi, John Guynn.  Glad you're back.

You're right in your implication that no source of energy has a zero
impact on the environment, including global greenhouse gases.  But
there are some that are orders of magnitude less polluting than
others.  Wind, solar, wave, geothermal, and nuclear sources of energy
produce far less net impact on global climate than oil, gas, and
coal.

The problem is, you seem to want to exercise un-restrained &quot;liberty&quot;
at the expense of other people.  Your argument sounds like the sort of
thing a spoiled child would say, at not being given an unlimited
credit card account that's paid by someone else.

The notion that we must have perfect knowledge about GW before we have
a moral obligation to do something about it is fundamentally flawed.
You don't have to *know* you are going to get into an auto accident to
justify buying auto insurance.  You don't have to *know* your house
will burn down to buy homeowner's insurance.

Similarly, governments don't have to *know* that a hurricane will hit
a particular part of the state to require all the houses in the state
to be constructed to building codes that will reduce the probability
of future occupants from being hurt in a hurricane.

The same argument holds for GW.  We don't need to have a perfect
knowledge of GW to buy ourselves insurance by doing what the best
available science tells us will mitigate the risks.

The scientific evidence for GW is significant.  It is happening, and
if we do nothing -- as the deniers propose -- it'll get far worse.
The consequences will be paid by future generations, at their expense,
because of ineptitude by our generation.

In short, what you propose is morally reprehensible.

But seriously, John, you were wrong both times (when you said it, and
when you agreed with yourself).  The &quot;do something&quot; option is a
continuum.  There are *many* things that can be done to help, some
more than others.  And some of those things cost absolutely nothing.

The only belligerent, non-compromising, binary course of action is &quot;do

idea that there's an economic argument to be made for buy insurance --
spending money in hopes of protecting yourself from an un-known risk.

Yeah.  That's what the cigarette companies said, too.  Do you accept
the Book of Mormon as &quot;truth,&quot; or do you think the subject requires
&quot;more careful research?&quot;  Your claims of skepticism ring hollow when
you have so little difficulty swallowing the un-proven claims of a
clumsy fraud like the Book of Mormon.  Clearly, for you facts are
things to be interpreted within your belief structure, and not the
other way around.

By the way, John, all other things being equal, clear nights tend to
be colder than cloudy nights.

Why is that?

Wrong analysis.  The &quot;problem&quot; of GW is presently unquantifiable.  You
cannot rationally ensure against risks that are so vague as to be

&gt; There's actually a quantitative way to deal with this -- it's called
&gt; &quot;game theory&quot; and it's a branch of mathematics.  You can use it to
&gt; find the optimum strategy of a whole host of situations and responses.

&gt; Here's a link where researchers applied it (within the context of
&gt; economic theory) to Global Warming:

Anyone can stack the deck to cause a game to yield a desired outcome.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, the burden of proof is really on the GW deniers.  You
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to prove that no really &quot;bad&quot; things will happen.

&gt; &gt; No, the burden of proof is on those who advocate a change to justify that
&gt; &gt; change.

&gt; I disagree.  Scientists need only show that GW has a reasonable chance
&gt; of happening and of having significant global repercussions on future
&gt; inhabitants of the world.
">

That's not true.  We have something called the Bill of Rights and the
Constitution, which guarantee certain liberties that cannot be taken
away.  Just because one can scientifically identify an ethnic minority
whose members are statistically more likely to commit crime than
another, that can never justify encarcerating the whole group to
prevent that risk under the Constitution or any ethical set of rules.
But if you are, like GW alarmists, willing to trample on people's
rights to prevent a risk from occurring, you could just as well
justify encarcerating an ethnic minority as you could justify forcing
people to radically alter their behavior to change global climate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At that point we have a moral obligation (in my opinion) not to ask
&gt; future generations to pay for our &quot;live in the moment&quot; and &quot;take no

That argument cuts both ways.  We have a moral obligation not to so
radically alter the economic balance as to cause a catastophie that
will cause misery to future generations.  It is well known that things
like the Kyoto accord are mere bandaids that won't do anything, yet
will cost trillions a year to implement.  If anthropogenic CO2 really
is causing runaway GW, then the only real solution is to eliminate
entirely mankind's output of CO2.  That, of course, is impossible
short of killing off all mankind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But on that we simply have different moral standards, as you've made
&gt; it clear that you have no qualms about asking future generations to
&gt; live with the consequences of GW.
">

Neither do you or other GW alarmists who want to saddle future
generations with radially altered lifestyles and habits that will be
economically and ecologically harmful to the planet.  If one considers
the vastness of the quantity of energy obtained from fossil fuels and
then compares the environmental impact of extracting such fuels
against the environmental impact of &quot;growing&quot; biofuels in the same
amount, one soon realizes that (1) it would be physically impossible
to make sufficient biofuels to replace fossil fuels and (2) it will
wreek havoc in multiple inintended and undesirable ways.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; In this case, the initial burden is on those who claim there is a
&gt; &gt; problem, to prove a problem even exists in the first place.  And GW in and of
&gt; &gt; itself is not a problem.

&gt; For someone living in Bangladesh, a rise of sea level equal to 1 meter
&gt; would be devastating.
">

For a family in Bangladesh living hand to mouth on the edge of
starvation, an increase in the price of food of 5% might be
devastating and lead to sickness or death.  A doubling of the price of
food would most certainly cause one or both and would be very likely
if Bangladesh turned their scare cropland into &quot;biofuel&quot; crops.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you cannot prove that, then you are assigning risk to others for your actions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and forcing them to bear the burden of your choices.  And I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's wrong.

&gt; &gt; I disagree.  There are really two choices, either do nothing or do something.

&gt; The &quot;do something&quot; choice is a continuum.  Only the &quot;do nothing&quot;
&gt; choice -- favored, it seems, by the GW deniers, is binary.
">

All choices have consequences.  To focus on only one consequence
(turning food crops into &quot;biofuel&quot; crops reduces overall C footprint
by some amount) while ignoring others (turning food crops into
&quot;biofuel&quot; crops is guaranteed to increase the price of food) is both
blind and immoral.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Either choice has consequences.  Either choice assigns risks to others.  Those
&gt; &gt; who advocate changing the status quo have the burden of showing the potential

&gt; Scientists have done that to within the threshold required for taking
&gt; action.
">

That is a matter of opinion.  Recently a representative of the UN
stated vehemently that turning food crops into &quot;biofuel&quot; crops was a
&quot;crime against humanity&quot;.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm

That's a pretty strong condemnation of one of the many proposed

Interestingly, the GW industry is a botique industry of the rich
countries, but it is the poor peoples of the world who will bear the
brunt of reduced arable food crop land as we plant billions of acres
of what you euphemistically call &quot;carbon neutral&quot; &quot;biofuels&quot;.  Causing

&gt; Similarly, governments don't have to *know* that a hurricane will hit
&gt; a particular part of the state to require all the houses in the state
&gt; to be constructed to building codes that will reduce the probability
&gt; of future occupants from being hurt in a hurricane.

&gt; The same argument holds for GW.  We don't need to have a perfect
&gt; knowledge of GW to buy ourselves insurance by doing what the best
&gt; available science tells us will mitigate the risks.

The analogy doesn't hold up as I've explained.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Your argument is akin pointing out that if you can identify
&gt; &gt; a certain societal subculture of men that are much more likely to
&gt; &gt; commit crimes than you we should go ahead lock them all up as a
&gt; &gt; preventative measure just in case.

&gt; Hogwash.   If we used that line of thought, governments wouldn't be
&gt; able to require auto insurance for drivers or building codes.

I personally believe the cost of attempting to fight GW will be much
much more than buying car insurance but that there will be no benefit
to the planet.  Reasonable minds can and do differ on this topic, and
no one has the right to make others pay for ameloriating risks they
don't believe exist or can be mitigated.

Ditto.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You need to prove that no really &quot;bad&quot; things will happen.  If you cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove that, then you are assigning risk to others for your actions,

&gt; &gt; The alarmists are asking people to radically change their lives with
&gt; &gt; no real proof of risk.

&gt; The scientific evidence for GW is significant.

There is also scientific evidence that turning cropland into biofuels
is bad, a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; according to one UN official.
Others abhore nuclear power, another one of your solutions to GW.
Still others don't like windmills in their backyards.  There are still
other environmentalists who flat out hate people and would be happy if
90% of the population were to die (I met one).

&gt; It is happening, and
&gt; if we do nothing -- as the deniers propose -- it'll get far worse.
&gt; The consequences will be paid by future generations, at their expense,
&gt; because of ineptitude by our generation.

You alarm might be admirable if it appeared you had considered the
cost to the poor people of the world by eliminating or sharply
reducing the use of fossil fuels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In short, what you propose is morally reprehensible.
">

What did I propose?  I merely questioned the premise of your alarmism
and the sanguinity of your supposed solution to the problem.  So far
you haven't made any persuasive case.  Isn't that the idea of debate?

I know.  Give us your opinion.
