&quot;BiblioBuffet is looking for passionate readers who are also excellent
writers. You do not need to have clips (though we like those), but
proper English skills are a given. The ability to meet deadlines is
crucial, as is integrity and openness. Most importantly, can you give us
writing worth reading? If so, we'd love to hear from you.

&quot;We pay $10 per piece (regardless of length). This is small, but it is
the beginning of what we hope will be a worthwhile financial return to
our contributors for their work. Though we cannot say when increases
will occur or by how much, we are committed to better-than-fair
remuneration. New content is posted each Sunday night. Payment for
contributions posted in one month is made on the first business day of
the next month, and is by check, though international contributors may
make special arrangements.

&quot;If you are not yet a regular reader, take time to look around the site.
Read some of our archives to get a feel for what we like to publish.
Even if you see someone already writing what you'd like to write, you
are welcome to inquire with samples of your own. If you are good, we'll
probably take you on since one writer’s voice is likely to be entirely
different from another’s.

&quot;We publish reviews, personal essays, editorials, commentary, humor,
interviews and profiles of people, places or things literary. In
addition, we welcome fiction be it short stories, poetry or excerpts
from upcoming or recent novels as long as they relate in some way to
reading, books or related subjects. Note that we do not use pieces on or
about writing. Contributions should run between 500 and 3,000 words,
though we can be flexible on the upper range.
