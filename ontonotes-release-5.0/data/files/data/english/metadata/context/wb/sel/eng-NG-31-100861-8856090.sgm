CJ had a round of that - he fell off a high shelf and hit the side of his
head on something, possible the edge of the utility sink.  Nothing broken,
just the brain/eye injury that eventually healed.  And no, he's not any
more careful now.

Could be neurological, i.e. brain problem. He also could be blind in
that eye. If you shine a light in the eye, does it change size? Does
the one get bigger when it is darker? Had to see it, I know,  because
you need light to see the eye.
