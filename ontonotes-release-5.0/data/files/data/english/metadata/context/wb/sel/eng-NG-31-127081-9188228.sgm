To: All European Citizens who care about Animals

This is a critical time. The European Commission (EC) is currently
revising the law - known as Directive 86/609 - that governs animal
experiments across Europe.

86/609 is a hugely powerful Directive that has power of life and death
over millions of animals across the continent - setting out minimum
standards for how and whether animals can be used in experiments.

A staggering ten million animals are used in outdated and wasteful
experiments in European laboratories every year. The Directive is
supposed to ensure &quot;the protection of animals used for experimental
and other scientific purposes&quot; but the huge numbers show that it's
just not doing that.

There is a real possibility that with enough support the EC will ban
all primate tests as part of the revised law.

Written Declaration 40/2007 urges the European Parliament to use the
revision process of Directive 86/609/EC as an opportunity to establish
a timetable for replacing the use of all primates in scientific
experiments with alternatives. The Declaration will fall on 7th
September and the signatures of half the MEPs in the Parliament is
needed by then.

If you care about animals visit the following website to urge them to
sign Written Declaration 40/2007.

If you want to do more:-

Please write to the European Commission and ask them to ban primate
tests. To help, a prepared letter can be found at

Spamming fanatic who knows nothing about the reality of animal use in
research and teaching, and whose intermittent tripe on this newsgroup
has nothing to do with genealogy of humans or other animals.

I might have some respect for his views if (a) he offered himself and
his dependents for use as experimental animals in drug research; or
(b) if he declined for himself and his dependents all drugs and
surgical procedures which have been developed by using animals,
including non-human primates.

Option (b) would solve his problem very quickly because it would mean
no treatment for any potentially fatal illness for which the existing
treatment was found and is maintained by using animals. Including,
especially in the context of this newsgroup, all human diseases which
have been illuminated by studies of the genealogy of animals and the
genetics of disease in them.

Tony is a hypocritical idiot.

We're not wildly OT for the reasons I stated. Much work on human
genetics has been done with animal models. The results then feed back
into the sort of questions genealogists are wont to ask. Such as X is
recorded as my father but is he really my father? This take us into
the dreaded field of DNA but long before that was 'invented' things
like the inheritance of blood groups had been worked out. Like DNA,
some patterns of blood groups could not prove that X was your father,
but other patterns could prove he wasn't.

but I agree, with the proviso that animals should be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I have never even heard of a scientist who didn't treat animals with
'compassion' or 'reduce suffering to the greatest degree possible.
There is a simple reason which the fanatics of BUAV choose to ignore,
and which has a direct counterpart in humans. Applying any form of
stress is apt to change the results of the experiment! In other words,
not having compassion and reducing suffering tends to destroy the
validity of one's own work.

Anybody in doubt should try handling lab rabbits which are extremely
sensitive to stress. A good expwerimenter (or future surgeon) can have
the bunny loose on the bench unconcernedly nibbling at a bit of
lettuce while it gets an injection in its peripheral ear vein. A not
so good handler will need a tea-towel to wrap the bunny and stop it
scrambling about. And then there are the folk who can't even approach
a bunny on a bench without it starts 'screaming'. They will never,
ever, make animal experimenters (or surgeons or doctors for that
matter). They just don't have the 'hands', and the hormonal surges
they induce in rabbits (or humans) are orders of magnitude more than
needed to screw up any study of bodily functions.

Furthermore, the BUAV makes a bid issue of 'vivisection' and puts in
context of 'millions of experiments.' They are wrong. If you add a
test drug to the feed of 50 mice but not to the feed of 50 genetically
matched mice, then you have done 100 animal experiments. Most of those
mice will die of old age. The information you get may be relevant to
the treatment of 10 million humans with a disease that drug could
cure.

If other analogues are an alternative in given

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; circumstances then they should be used (I readily admit I have not
&gt; the faintest idea of the practicability of that)
">

In some instances tests on cell cultures are possible, and are used.
Why bother with a whole complex animal with all sorts of possible
confusing factors if the answer is gettable with a nice simple cell
culture?

Unfortunately, animal and human bodies are exceedingly complex things,
anmd there is no knowing without doing the experiments as to whether a
highly desirable effect in some kinds of cells carries the price of
diastrous effects on other kinds of cells. Thalidomide is a case in
point.

In all medical matters it becomes a question of balancing suffering.
One of my projects involved administering a substance to a troop of
baboons in the expectation that they would go mad and die. Postmortems
would show how and why they died. That is about as grim as it can get.
The experiment went ahead, the baboons went mad, and died suffering.
Would I cause such a thing to be done again? Yes. Unhesitatingly. If
the benefit to humans was on the same scale. The benefit was the
understanding of just how dangerous aflatoxin is, and how necessary it
was to make sure there was none in foodstuffs eaten by billions of
people. Killing a couple of dozen baboons strikes me as an acceptable
price for a couple of billion human lives.

If you can't stomach that sort of decision, don't get in the game and
don't criticise those who make that sort of decision to ensure your
child doesn't go mad and die. An awful lot of genealogies wouldn't
have happened if it hadn't been for hard-headed bastards who made
those kinds of decisions in developing drugs and procedures which
enabled people to survive to reproductive age.

I put it in a simple way to a GP several visits ago when adjusting my
prescription to make use of new drug discoveries. 'If I had been
diagnosed with diabetes 25 years earlier, I would have died 50 years
ago. And I ould never have seen my children marry or seen a single one
of my 12 grandchildren.' Of the 8 drugs I now take, only one -
ordinary aspirin - was available 25 years ago. The other 7 were
developed with the aid of animal testing, and two of them are assayed
batchwise with more animal testing. All the operations I've had in the
last five years involved surgeons who trained and experimented on
animals, as will the operations soon to come. Those comments are not
just true of me. As a generality they are true of all patients.

You didn't have to read it. Or even download it.

What I posted in this thread is all about  warning that a spamming
fanatic, who has misused this and other groups before, is inviting
support for a petition which is based on nonsense, hypocrisy, and
misinformation about the development of drugs and of surgical
procedures.

If you already knew the tripe is tripe, you wouldn't have needed my
input and needn't have read it. A very large number of people do not
know the tripe is tripe. Before they add their names to the petition
they are entitled to be told that it is tripe, and why that is so.

In the particular context of genealogy and genetic illness, the topic
is relevant because studies on animals have made an enormous and
essential contribution to what we are beginning to understand about
illnesses in human beings, and that leads on to new possibilities of
treating and management. That in turn leads on to some people
surviving to reproductive age who would not have survived at all as
little as one generation ago. That has changed possible genealogies
and will change more.

There is a simple reason why lab animals are used in research on
genetic diseases. Mice, rats, and rabbits are three kinds of animal
which breed very much faster than we do. So genetic and environmental
effects can be studied in 'real time' as far as a scientist is
concerned.

But there is a disadvantage in using animals when in the final stages
of developing new methods of management. Although much of the
biochemistry of all animals is identical with human biochemistry,
there are differences between species. By definition! So there is
always a possibility that a drug which works in some animals will not
work in humans, or a drug which does not affect some animals will
affect humans. When I were a lad, in the last century, this was known
as species specificity.

There is a trick way round s-s if one is prepared to cope with the
chaos and muddle involved. Studying native medicines. By definition
they were evolved with humans as the test animal. That is why I
studied them. Then you come back to the inconvenient fact that those
humans don't breed quickly enough for direct observation. But the
researcher can get round that, insofar as informants are ever
reliable, by collecting information on the genealogy of the people
concerned together with what they have to say about the health and
deaths of eachother. An anthropologist would use a phrase like
'kinship studies'. That is why I became and anthropologist, and did
other field sciences, in addition to the chemistry and other lab
sciences. In the phrase of a 'friend' introducing me decades ago I was
'both field mouse and lab rat'.

But in this kind of research there are other messinesses to add to the
general mess of genealogy. The way through is consideration of scraps
of information from very many sources. Hopefully a truth can be
glimpsed darkly through the murk. In every case the question always is
'Can I rely on what this informant says?' And that includes written
and official records. The answer is often 'No.' Then one has to try to
figure out what it is the informant has muddled innocently or what
they are lying about to their own advantage.

That is one problem one doesn't have with caged lab animals. It is
very easy indeed to make sure that the father listed in the
documentation is the real genetic father. One merely isolates the
female(s) with one male in the cage. Then any babies have got to be
his. Humans have tried similar procedures, such as harems, but they
don't have the same certainty and in western society are mostly
unacceptable. We cannot 'lock up our daughters'.

So human genealogy is always alleged genealogy, whereas the genealogy
of lab animals used for testing is something that can be known for
certain. That is how we know that 15% or so of alleged genealogies in
humans are wrong as to paternity in every generation. With enough lab
animals breeding fast enough it is possible in real time not only to
work through the obvious combinations of genes but also the very
unlikely genetic events, such as viable  mutations. That delimits what
does not happen.  When a human child presents with a combination that
does not happen, then it's a racing certainty that the daddy on the
birth certificate isn't daddy, but daddy don't know.

By the way, specific breeding programmes with lab rabbits are animal
experimentation and count in the 'millions' the fanatics count. From
the friskiness of bucks and does in the animal house of my lab I
gathered that they rather enjoyed the experiment. They certainly
seemed happy to repeat it. Our object was to breed a consistent strain
of 'flopsy bunnies' with enormous ears. The size of the peripheral
vein is proportional to the size of the ear. So a flopsy bunny is easy
to give an intravenous injection, and to take a blood sample from the
opposite ear. It doesn't hurt the bunny any more than my frequent
injections and blood tests hurt me. But it counts in the 'millions'.

Credit where credit is due. The founding stock of bunnies for my lab
were the Charterhouse and the Rahere strains bred by a very clever
technician in the animal house of Bart's. Our lot had recorded
genealogies that made human genealogies look rather pathetic in number
of generations. And the rabbit genealogies were real whereas the human
genealogies were alleged.

LOL

beautiful post Don !!

In the viking world you had to have no slave blood for 5 generations to
own land

On the Faeroe Islands the old lady with the keys to a local museum
asked a young man to name his ancestors
when he faltered
she said &quot;Are you no better than a sheep - our shepherds know the
ancestry of their sheep for more than 5 generations&quot;

The BUAV has been campaigning peacefully for over 100 years towards a
world where no-one wants or believes we need to experiment on animals.
We are of course entirely happy to engage in reasoned argument and
debate with those that have opposing views on this issue. However, we
would never sink to name calling. Labelling the BUAV as 'fanatics' is
not only entirely innacurate and libelous, but also demeans an
important scientific and ethical debate.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tony is a hypocritical idiot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Don

&gt;&gt; &gt; We are wildly OT,

&gt;&gt; We're not wildly OT for the reasons I stated. Much work on human
&gt;&gt; genetics has been done with animal models. The results then feed
&gt;&gt; back
&gt;&gt; into the sort of questions genealogists are wont to ask. Such as X
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; recorded as my father but is he really my father? This take us into
&gt;&gt; the dreaded field of DNA but long before that was 'invented' things
&gt;&gt; like the inheritance of blood groups had been worked out. Like DNA,
&gt;&gt; some patterns of blood groups could not prove that X was your
&gt;&gt; father,
&gt;&gt; but other patterns could prove he wasn't.

&gt;&gt;  but I agree, with the proviso that animals should be&gt; treated with
&gt;&gt; compassion and suffering should be reduced to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; greatest degree possible.

&gt;&gt; I have never even heard of a scientist who didn't treat animals
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; 'compassion' or 'reduce suffering to the greatest degree possible.
&gt;&gt; There is a simple reason which the fanatics ofBUAVchoose to ignore,
&gt;&gt; and which has a direct counterpart in humans. Applying any form of
&gt;&gt; stress is apt to change the results of the experiment! In other
&gt;&gt; words,
&gt;&gt; not having compassion and reducing suffering tends to destroy the
&gt;&gt; validity of one's own work.

&gt;&gt; Anybody in doubt should try handling lab rabbits which are
&gt;&gt; extremely
&gt;&gt; sensitive to stress. A good expwerimenter (or future surgeon) can
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; the bunny loose on the bench unconcernedly nibbling at a bit of
&gt;&gt; lettuce while it gets an injection in its peripheral ear vein. A
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; so good handler will need a tea-towel to wrap the bunny and stop it
&gt;&gt; scrambling about. And then there are the folk who can't even
&gt;&gt; approach
&gt;&gt; a bunny on a bench without it starts 'screaming'. They will never,
&gt;&gt; ever, make animal experimenters (or surgeons or doctors for that
&gt;&gt; matter). They just don't have the 'hands', and the hormonal surges
&gt;&gt; they induce in rabbits (or humans) are orders of magnitude more
&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt; needed to screw up any study of bodily functions.

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, theBUAVmakes a bid issue of 'vivisection' and puts in
&gt;&gt; context of 'millions of experiments.' They are wrong. If you add a
&gt;&gt; test drug to the feed of 50 mice but not to the feed of 50
&gt;&gt; genetically
&gt;&gt; matched mice, then you have done 100 animal experiments. Most of
&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt; mice will die of old age. The information you get may be relevant
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; the treatment of 10 million humans with a disease that drug could
&gt;&gt; cure.

&gt;&gt; If other analogues are an alternative in given&gt; circumstances then
&gt;&gt; they should be used (I readily admit I have not
&gt;&gt; &gt; the faintest idea of the practicability of that)

&gt;&gt; In some instances tests on cell cultures are possible, and are
&gt;&gt; used.
&gt;&gt; Why bother with a whole complex animal with all sorts of possible
&gt;&gt; confusing factors if the answer is gettable with a nice simple cell
&gt;&gt; culture?

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, animal and human bodies are exceedingly complex
&gt;&gt; things,
&gt;&gt; anmd there is no knowing without doing the experiments as to
&gt;&gt; whether a
&gt;&gt; highly desirable effect in some kinds of cells carries the price of
&gt;&gt; diastrous effects on other kinds of cells. Thalidomide is a case in
&gt;&gt; point.

&gt;&gt; In all medical matters it becomes a question of balancing
&gt;&gt; suffering.
&gt;&gt; One of my projects involved administering a substance to a troop of
&gt;&gt; baboons in the expectation that they would go mad and die.
&gt;&gt; Postmortems
&gt;&gt; would show how and why they died. That is about as grim as it can
&gt;&gt; get.
&gt;&gt; The experiment went ahead, the baboons went mad, and died
&gt;&gt; suffering.
&gt;&gt; Would I cause such a thing to be done again? Yes. Unhesitatingly.
&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt; the benefit to humans was on the same scale. The benefit was the
&gt;&gt; understanding of just how dangerous aflatoxin is, and how necessary
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; was to make sure there was none in foodstuffs eaten by billions of
&gt;&gt; people. Killing a couple of dozen baboons strikes me as an
&gt;&gt; acceptable
&gt;&gt; price for a couple of billion human lives.

&gt;&gt; If you can't stomach that sort of decision, don't get in the game
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; don't criticise those who make that sort of decision to ensure your
&gt;&gt; child doesn't go mad and die. An awful lot of genealogies wouldn't
&gt;&gt; have happened if it hadn't been for hard-headed bastards who made
&gt;&gt; those kinds of decisions in developing drugs and procedures which
&gt;&gt; enabled people to survive to reproductive age.

&gt;&gt; I put it in a simple way to a GP several visits ago when adjusting
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; prescription to make use of new drug discoveries. 'If I had been
&gt;&gt; diagnosed with diabetes 25 years earlier, I would have died 50
&gt;&gt; years
&gt;&gt; ago. And I ould never have seen my children marry or seen a single
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; of my 12 grandchildren.' Of the 8 drugs I now take, only one -
&gt;&gt; ordinary aspirin - was available 25 years ago. The other 7 were
&gt;&gt; developed with the aid of animal testing, and two of them are
&gt;&gt; assayed
&gt;&gt; batchwise with more animal testing. All the operations I've had in
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; last five years involved surgeons who trained and experimented on
&gt;&gt; animals, as will the operations soon to come. Those comments are
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; just true of me. As a generality they are true of all patients.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I must admit that I feel more uncomfortable about animal testing
&gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; cosmetics, but, even there, if we allow cosmetics to be sold
&gt;&gt; &gt; then, I
&gt;&gt; &gt; suppose a testing regime is essential.

&gt;&gt; I have bever used cosmetics in my life, and don't see the point of
&gt;&gt; making myself look something I am not. If things are not useful, I
&gt;&gt; wouldn't take the risk of using them whether tested or not.
&gt;&gt; Furthermore I am of that generation who did real chemistry at
&gt;&gt; school
&gt;&gt; as a full subject, and the lessons included the disastrous effects
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; antimony compounds used in cosmetics by the ancient Egyptians. I
&gt;&gt; write
&gt;&gt; as a bloke. I wouldn't expect the ladies to agree.

So your 'ethics' include 'Tony' spamming groups groups with other
agendas, and doing so anonymously with the BUAV attribution well
buried?

Your 'ethics' include deliberate misleading about what constitutes
'animal experiments' and the real numbers and nature thereof?

Your 'ethics' about peaceful representation include no condemnation of
violence or exclusion from your organisation of anybody who practises
violence and intimidation?

Above all, do your 'ethics' extend to watching your child die when
they could be saved easily by a drug or surgical procedure because
those things were developed with the aid of animal experiments and
were trained using animals? By the same token, do your ethics include
letting your 'topcat' suffer and die because all vets necessarily do
animal experiments and use drugs tested on animals - else how the hell
would they know what to do?

You want to argue ethics with me? By all means. Name your time and
place, and be prepared to bring and publish the medical records of
yourself, your family, BUAV members, and the pets thereof. Then we'll
see how mouthings and misrepresentations correspond with reality.

And you might take 'Tony' by the scruff of the neck and sling him out
of BUAV for bringing it into disrepute by repeatedly spamming in its
name and in support of its idiotic petition. Idiotic because it can
have no effect on the process of governance. It was doomed to achieve
nothing, as have almost all such petitions on many different topics.

I have said before and I'll say it again. Politicians in Government
was to stay in Government. It's a far nicer trough into which to stick
snouts than is Opposition. In the UK the rough figures are that if
250,000 people would vote AGAINST the Government in a general election
because of a single issue and regardless of all other promises made by
the politicians, the Government won't even stop to think about the
subject. When it reaches 500,000  potential votes, the Government will
stop to think and may or may not shift. When you have 1,000,000
committed votes AGAINST, Government doesn't have to stop to think. It
changes policy to meet your demand because if it doesn't all those
snouts are coming out of the trough at the next election. Letting off
steam in petitions is a Machiavellian way of reducing actual committed
votes AGAINST. So your problem becomes quite simple. You have to show
that you can drum up 1,000,000 voters who are prepared to lay down and
die, or let their kids lay down and die, rather than have their lives
saved by the use of any drug or surgical procedure developed with the
aid of animal experiments. I'd rather bet on hell freezing over.

Meanwhile, I and my children will continue to look after assorted pets
and wildlife,

Just to be clear the BUAV has not been involved in spamming of any
sort. It doesn't fit with our strategy of engaging in informed and
intelligent debate in credible fora as demonstrated recently with
appearances on Newsnight and Radio 4's PM program. We have no control
over the actions of supporters and sympathisers, and if they wish to
post to newsgroups its up to them. From what I can see the original
post contained links to several organisations for more information
about a campaign to end primate experiments in Europe - not just the
BUAV. I hope this will put an end to entirely innacurate defamation of
the BUAV's name - and stop wasting time on both sides.

Lucky old lady if she could see!

The Faeroe Islanders are a very interesting group  of people because
their genealogy is so well known and because they have a very high
incidence of glaucoma. The naive would use the one to prove that the
other was a genetic disease. And be wrong.

The high incidence (one of the highest in the world, along with Middle
Eastern Jews and with the Jains of India) is not a matter of
commonality of genes but of common diet. In the case of the Islanders,
they feed their animals on Papaver naudicale, which like most Papaver
and Fumaria contains sanguinarine. Some of that gets into the milk and
thence into the people. That is what causes the high incidence of
glaucoma.

The Jains get their sanguinarine through milk too. The Jews get theirs
by using poppy seed on bread and in cooking.

It is possible to avoid the glaucoma - by dying of cancer first. The
cancer is induced by benz(c)acridine which is a metabolic product of
sanguinarine and therefore also in the milk.  So an apparent genetic
liability to some kinds of cancer also turns out to be a matter of
common diet.

The 'proof' lies in looking at Islanders and their descendants who
have migrated to places where their diet is necessarily different. If
the rates of glaucoma and cancer remained the same, they'd be genetic.
If the rates drop to 'normal' levels the high incidence is due to diet
because genes don't change that fast. The second is what is observed.

Then he really is an idiot since there are very few spiders in the UK
which are directly dangerous to humans but they polish off a lot of
insects which do carry diseases deadly to humans. There is one
rationale to 'being afraid of spiders' and it applies particularly to
house spiders (such as Tegenaria gigantica and its bigger cousin T.
domestica). If teggies would kindly run through a bath before running
over me, I wouldn't mind. But they carry a cargo of Dendrophagus,
house mites, which are what people are actually allergic to when the
say 'allergic to house dust'. So an unwashed teggie that runs across
my hand would leave a track of itchy spots which would quite quickly
turn to a swollen hand. The answer is not to react by killing the
spiders. Let them run on doing their job, but just get out of their
way. I've no idea what the genetics of this allergy is, and I don't
know the genetics of the shellfish allergy either, but there is a
genetic component in  both. What I do know is that there is a very
high incidence of both allergies in descendants of BAIN living in

The nature of animals is that they can live only by preying on plants
and other animals. I don't find the fact of being a predator sad. What
I find inexpressibly sad, even wanton and mind-boggling, is preying
beyond necessity. To kill more than is needed for the moment is to
steal from the future; to take the food out of the mouths of one's own
descendants and thereby diminish their chance of survival. It is a
lesson that does not have to be learned from theory. It is embedded in
our own genealogy and readily available by studying what happened to
our ancestors, and even more so by studying those who become no-one's
ancestors. Would I kill one animal for food? In the blink of an eye.
Would I kill an extra one for fun or feast? Never.

Would I as a scientist kill even one lab animal unnecessarily? Not
bloody likely! I know how much time, trouble and money it takes to
produce lab animals in fine fettle. The picture of 'mad scientists'
engaged in 'millions' of 'vivisections' is utterly ridiculous. However
mad we are, we couldn't afford it, either in money terms or in
validity of experimental results. And there wouldn't be enough of us
working 24/7 to do 'millions' of 'vivisections' every year anyway. It
is more than somewhat stretching the meaning if 'vivisection' to
include structuring carefully three meals, taking 8 pills by mouth,
giving 3 injections, and taking and testing 5 drop-sized blood samples
per day. That's not a total of 19 'vivisections' of an animal. That is
a routine day. For me. I will admit to occasionally getting a small
hurt when I hit a vein with an injection instead of going in
sub-cutaneously and painlessly. It pisses me off. Not because of the
negligible pain but because it leaves a small bruise as evidence of
sloppy technique; and I really cannot abide sloppy technique in
experiments.

Animal experiments which get into the region BUAV implies for all
experiments, are done only for compelling reason.  The game has to be
very well worth the candle. See what I wrote about baboons and
aflatoxin.

One upon a time it is true that animals were 'harvested' for
cosmetics. There wasn't much option. The musky (i.e. sexy) smell of
musk deer was the sole source. No longer. Musk deer live in bloody
inaccessible places, there aren't many of them, and any one yields
very little musk - all reasons why the stuff was so expensive. Then
natural product chemists identified the compound responsible for the
odour; and synthetic chemists got on with making a whole series of
'large ring ketones' including muscone. It's a hell of a lot easier,
cheaper and more reliable to mess about with glassware in a lab or
pilot plant than it is to scramble about mountainous terrain to catch
enough deer to yield about a hundredthousandth of what can be made in
one batch in the lab. Similar statements could be made for very many
other odoriferous compounds which were originally found in animals.
'Underneath' the brands you read about in perfumery there is a whole
industry of manufacturing essencers and perfumers making the
components. More and more synthetically, less and less extracting
animal tissues.

It is work that also has an interesting genealogical twist. Much of
the reproductive behaviour of humans is controlled by pheromones, our
equivalents of the scents the animals use. The point of a pheromone is
that the olfaction takes place without any conscious realisation that
it is happening. To put it crudely, a bloke can smell (but usually not
know he is smelling) when a girl is at the point of her cycle when she
is most likely to conceive. He can smell when she is 'on heat'. What
perfumers are trying to do is mimic or mask that smell. So depending
which perfume a girl wears she'll have a horde of boys hanging around
with their tongues out, or a bunch of male friends taking no
particular notice. She'll know why. They won't. When she finds the
bloke she wants to father her kids, she'll reel him in and he won't
even see the invisible line, the perfume trail, on which he is being
reeled. It really doesn't matter much whether it is human, dog, or a
little boll weevil. Traces of the right scent on the wind lead to a
bit of descendant-making.

If he is not a member, then why the hell does he repeatedly spam

'Reasoned argument' is precisely what you and BUAV do not engage in.
You have no substantive response to reasoned arguments, or to the
public challenge to prove on your own bodies the validity of your
arguments. It is quite simple. If you want no animal experiments then
you are logically obliged to decline all benefits accruing from animal
experiments. You don't do that. How do I know? You're alive.

Another one who hasn't a bloody clue about the evolution of drugs for
human and animal use, and purveys emotive nonsense.

For example no-one ever said 'the major ingredient for treatment of a
deadly ovarian cancer ... came from a primate.' That assertion is
utter balls, and therefore anything and everything based on it is
drivel. What happened, and had to happen, was that a purified single
compound, after a lot of testing on cell cultures and other mammals
was tested on non-human primates. After that it was test on human
primates. Only after that was it released for clinical use. Each stage
of testing yielded information required for risk assessment before the
next stage of testing. Even so, the final round of pre-clinical
testing on humans could have yielded information on unforeseen side
effects which would have made the compound too dangerous to use in
clinical practice.

And it doesn't stop there. There is a two pronged continuing process
of testing. One consists of making variations on the compound to try
to find versions with more desirable effects and less side effects,
and they all have to go through the same processes of testing.  The
other consists of collecting reports of any ill effects during
clinical use. This second prong exposes side effects so rare that they
wouldn't be likely to be picked up in the much smaller number of
non-human primates used in testing.

The naive idea that one could go and scrape some bark off a tree and
get a medicine to be used there and then on many humans but without
any further testing on animals is daft beyond belief. Stories about
some natives using some local bark for some purpose are littered with
errors, many of those errors being fatal mistakes in themselves and
due to different views of how medicines act. Sorting out such messes
was the raison d'etre of both research labs I founded.

No I don't believe in female mountain spirits who can squeeze their
pendulous nipples into the hot eyes of ill people and thus cool down
those eyes. I don't need to invent 'piat'ma manadu', as did the
Akawaio of Guyana. I believe that the pendulous white fungi that the
Akawaio gathered had in the fluid held by the hyphae an antibiotic
which killed the bacteria causing the eye inflammation. And if that
belief was wrong, then the Akawaio had used a similar looking fungus
growing in the area from which they migrated and that fungus contained
an antibiotic. And I would investigate that belief scientifically in
the lab. When I had pure compounds I would test them on a range of lab
animals to see if there were any unfortunate side-effects. If not, I'd
gradually up the ante. Testing more varieties of the compound on more
animals.

Then I'd do the bit that is frowned on nowadays but in my training was
regarded as a matter of honour. I'd take the stuff myself before
passing it for trial on any other human. Then it would be out of my
hands. Up to big pharma to make 3000 variations on the theme and test
them all to get the best possible thing to put on pharmacy shelves. It
rarely would be the original compound discovered. My bit was providing
the leads and getting rid of the ineffectual nonsense and the
obviously lethal.

To get from my start to the pharmacy shelf could not be done
responsibly in under 15 years, 20 years was more like it, and 25 years
was not surprising. The whole game start to finish would cost about
£700million per go. You have to be pretty damn big pharma to afford
one go, let alone a continual stream of goes. So every painstaking
step by painstaking step has to be done meticulously carefully and
responsibly. One tiny cock up means you bet the company and lost.

The idea that people rush about scraping bark off trees, sticking it
in furry animals, and then butchering them for fun is so damn stupid
that it is grossly offensive to the tens of thousands of people who
spend their professional lives developing drugs and procedures to
postpone death for billions of people.

Of course what Jimserac and other fanatics class as an 'animal' is
itself illuminating. How about 5m of sea-going crocodile. Is that
'innocent' or is it what it really is, a top predator and very fast
and strong with it. How about a 5mm long Anopheles mosquito? That's an
animal too, and it'll innocently give you malaria. Ever seen apes
tearing apart living colobus monkeys? Both are animals and both are
furry too. Are both 'innocent'?  The whole line of Jimserac's argument
is pathetic. And I say to him what I said to Ms Harding. He doesn't
practice what he preaches. I know because he is still alive. He would
have been carried off long since if he hadn't taken advantage of
medicines or surgical procedures tested on animals.

Maybe we ought to find an island isolated by vast expanse of ocean for
the fanatics to go and live and breed on. Then they can live their way
with smallpox, anthrax, malaria, TB, leprosy, septicaemia, meningitis,
blindness and an assortment of cancers, not to mention manageable
auto-immune diseases by the dozen, all without any form of treatment
at all. Because successful treatment of all those things has depended
on animal testing and they wouldn't want to take advantage of what
they disapprove of. My guess is that it would lead to one of the
shortest and simplest genealogies ever. Those who didn't die before
reproducing would find their kids dying of childhood illnesses for
which they would be refusing treatment. The isolation would mean there
was no external population from which to make up losses. There,
statistically, wouldn't be enough time or genetic diversity in a small
population to build up resistant strains of human.  Still, the
citizens of BUAVland would die happy, and so would we because they
wouldn't be bothering us any more with their nonsense.

&gt;&gt;On the Faeroe Islands the old lady with the keys to a local museum

&gt;&gt;when he faltered
&gt;&gt;she said &quot;Are you no better than a sheep - our shepherds know the
&gt;&gt;ancestry of their sheep for more than 5 generations&quot;

&gt; Lucky old lady if she could see!

&gt; The Faeroe Islanders are a very interesting group  of people because
&gt; their genealogy is so well known and because they have a very high
&gt; incidence of glaucoma. The naive would use the one to prove that the
&gt; other was a genetic disease. And be wrong.

&gt; The high incidence (one of the highest in the world, along with Middle
&gt; Eastern Jews and with the Jains of India) is not a matter of
&gt; commonality of genes but of common diet. In the case of the Islanders,
&gt; they feed their animals on Papaver naudicale, which like most Papaver
&gt; and Fumaria contains sanguinarine. Some of that gets into the milk and
&gt; thence into the people. That is what causes the high incidence of
&gt; glaucoma.

&gt; The Jains get their sanguinarine through milk too. The Jews get theirs
&gt; by using poppy seed on bread and in cooking.

&gt; It is possible to avoid the glaucoma - by dying of cancer first. The
&gt; cancer is induced by benz(c)acridine which is a metabolic product of
&gt; sanguinarine and therefore also in the milk.  So an apparent genetic
&gt; liability to some kinds of cancer also turns out to be a matter of
&gt; common diet.

&gt; The 'proof' lies in looking at Islanders and their descendants who
&gt; have migrated to places where their diet is necessarily different. If
&gt; the rates of glaucoma and cancer remained the same, they'd be genetic.
&gt; If the rates drop to 'normal' levels the high incidence is due to diet
&gt; because genes don't change that fast. The second is what is observed.

So where is the BUAV Press release condemning the recent claim by
animal rights activists to have spiked Savlon cream with something
which - in their own words - would cause harm to human users? Users
who would include 'innocent' (Jimserac's word) babies.

Either the claim is a lie or it is true. If it is a lie this
constitutes 'reasoned argument'? It is 'reasoned' to sow fear and
confusion in mothers now worrying what they might have done to their
babies? Worrying pointlessly because the assertion of contamination
was a lie.

If the claim is true, then these terrorists will be doing - and knew
they would be doing - injury to all humans (who are themselves
animals) who have bought and will use the contaminated cream. No
amount of withdrawal from shops will get back what has already been
taken out of the shop and used by customers. This is how you think an
'important ... ethical debate' is conducted?

If you don't come out with condemnation of what are serious criminal
actions, then you condone those actions. Mealy-mouthed claims about
not be able to control what your supporters do will not wash. It is a
simple binary choice. Condemn or condone, publicly.

You also, Ms Harding, have a citizen's duty if you know the
identities of any of these criminals. You are obliged to lay that
information with the police. You will try to get out of that duty on
the grounds you do not know any identities. A likely story, as the
saying goes.

I note the ongoing thunderous silence about my challenge to you to go
public with the proofs, or otherwise, of the use by you, your family
and your BUAV colleagues of benefitting from animal experiments. Any
time, any place - subject to me not being in medical care at the
chosen time. You are the media person so you arrange the media
coverage. It's put up or shut up time, dearie. And if you choose shut
up, then shut up Tony, Jimserac, and all others of your 'supporters',

IIRC, the 15% was based on blood-types.  Type This mother

if one of the children is a Type Other, then Type That

Divert yourself to medical genetics literature and enjoy.

The prime source of data are kids presenting with what may be a
genetic disease, and the question arising as to whether it would be
wise to ensure no more kids. The child and its alleged parents are all
genetically tested, and a careful geneticist would test siblings if
any and if allowed. Take out all cases of kids where one or both
birthparents are unknown. Consider only the subset where the alleged
mother and alleged father are married and are allegedly faithful. In
that subset it is found that Mum is almost always the mother but Dad
is not the father in about 15% of cases, even though registered as
such.

The figure is believed to apply more generally because it correlates
with another figure. About 1 in 6 marriages is childless because of
serological incompatibility between husband and wife.

Being a mere bloke I have no experience of how intense and how common
the desire is of a woman to fill her womb at least once. But as an
observer from the outside it seems to me to be a significant driving
force in the behaviour of many women, regardless of social class. This
is quite a separate thing from any pleasure or otherwise in sexual
intercourse. I also observe that women are much more conscious than
men of the 'biological clock running out'. If they want a child and
haven't had one after years of marriage they get increasingly
desperate as 40 approaches. It is well within living memory that such
a woman had only three options.

She could resign herself to being childless. She could keep trying,
and praying and whatever else she thought might help with her husband.
Or she could use a stud. Someone she had no intention of having an
affair with, who wasn't going to be asked for maintenance, and who
preferably wasn't going to be around during the child's growing up.

In any society based on farming, any woman however 'uneducated' will
know that like tends to breed like. So the ideal stud would be as much
like her husband as possible. A brother or cousin or uncle would
serve. If she has to look further afield then, say, a blonde blue-eyed
white woman with a fair blue-eyed whit husband isn't going to be so
daft as to pick a black-haired brown-eyed dark-skinned stud.

So she'll pick on superficial likeness. But that isn't genetic
likeness in detail. And it is the hidden effects of genes which lead
to the discovery. And to a lot of angst when the geneticist has to
break the news to a child and a husband that their mother and wife has
been living a lie for years.

It ought to be pretty obvious why such cases are not named and do not
appear in the public domain. In learned papers you'll find the cases
are individually anonymised and the stats are given as collective data
and therefore also anonymous.

So no you won't find records, except in the rare court case; and no
you can't tell just by looking at happy families.

There is a lurking danger in the commercialising of DNA profiling and
the availability to the public without going through a medical
geneticist who has experience of handling angst-ridden situations.
What happens when the profile comes back not proving who your father
is but proving that Dad is not? Or, for that matter, proving you are
not the father of your child, and didn't know that small fact. Will
the commercial lab be liable for the consequences? Not bloody likely.

But enjoy delving into reams of learned journals, if you don't want to
accept the simple summary above.

Case histories are not reported by name for reasons I've explained.

There are always suggestions for different proportions, but they don't
matter. The whole field is fraught with such uncertainty that 15% is
taken as 'near enough is good enough'. Fairly obviously there are
socio-cultural differences and changes over time. There is also a
'suspicion' of changes with age of the woman and duration of the
marriage without children. The older the woman and the longer the
marriage without children the more one suspects that a single late
child is not the child of 'Daddy'.

These sorts of studies go back to the 'pre-DNA' era when blood groups
were the main methods of guessing at parenthood. Not only the ABO
system but numerous minor blood groups, which are genetically
determined. The name to play with from that era is A E Mourant. I've
mentioned him on this group before.

Mourant is the bloke who upset the 'Cornish' who insist they are
different from the people on the other side of the Tamar. He showed
from the distribution of minor blood groups that 'Cornish' and
'Devonians' are genetically one population. He managed to upset
'white' supporters of Norwich up in London for football and a bit of
'paki-bashing'  that the 'whites' were part-Pathan themselves. He also
showed how the relationship between Norfolk ag labs and hill folk of
the North West Frontier had come about. His work is full of such
upsetting snippets.

Since most of the original work pre-dates electronic methods of data
handling you've got only two choices. Go to a medical library and
start heaving books off shelves and trawling through printed indexes.
If you are fit enough to do the heaving about (I'm not any more) and
have the time, then this is the way to go because it leads to
serendipitous discoveries. If you can't do that then you'll just have
to hope the old journals have been scanned and auto-indexed, and that
means in effect that you need access to JSTOR. That access comes
through university libraries and departments or personally via the
membership of various learned societies. In the latter case you will
meet a demand from Blackwell's to drop the security protection on your
computer so they can put their spyware on your machine. Not on my
computer. So I don't use personal access. If you don't mind spyware on
your computer, and have an appropriate membership, good luck in
searching from home. If you do mind and/or don't have an appropriate
membership, you'll have to be off to some library where you have
reading rights and they have JSTOR rights.

The key thing to remember is what I've said so often about DNA
profiling. There can be no proof that a particular male IS the father
of a child. The best that can be achieved is that blood groups, DNA or
whatever are 'consistent with.' That is not a proof unless it is
possible to show that thee is only one male qualifying as 'consistent
with', and that is never possible. So the proofs are always the other
way round. The known laws of genetics can be used to show that a
particular male IS NOT the father of the child.

And thus there is an even bigger uncertainty in the 15% figure. If the
stud is a close relative of 'Daddy' then it is entirely possible that
the negative cannot be proved. So it is entirely possible that 'out
there' are such things as undetected cases where 'Daddy' is not the
father, but 'Uncle' is. Of course, if Daddy and Uncle happen to be
identical twins, it is never going to be possible to sort it by any
method.
