God DAMN it, Andre, I could have done just fine without seeing that.

Did you have to?  I don't like that kind of shit.  And - excuse me for
asking - is there any sort of proof that the, um, receptacle, so to
speak, is indeed Bret Ludwig?  I mean, I *hate* that bent shit, but
I don't want to see any of it laid on anyone who doesn't deserve
it.

I was just trying to inject some levity into a fairly bitter flamewar
by giving &quot;kudos&quot; to Ludwig for offing cats (not that I *really*
hate cats all that much, to the extent that I'd like to see 'em
shot) but I had no idea he was shooting *thousands* of
them.  As far as I know, the only place on the planet that
is overrun with feral cats is down in Oz, where they are
certainly a problem for ranchers.  I read on a hunting
dog NG about a rancher down under who imported
three Redbone coonhounds (the kind I have) for cat
control, and those hounds ate or ran off all the cats
on this fellow's enormous ranch in less than a month.

I must take you to task for linking the word &quot;coon&quot; (in
its racist connotation) with the word &quot;coonhounds,&quot;
as there is simply *no* connection.  Redbone (and
other breeds of) coonhounds are bred to hunt RACOONS,
not black people.  I recently saw some ignoramus on
another NG telling people that &quot;coonhounds&quot; were so
called because they were used in the South to chase
down escaped black prisoners, which is just plain
stupid.  While such dogs may indeed have been
included in hound packs which were used on such
occasions, other dogs from the hound group would
have been present also, especially bloodhounds.
The local sheriff's (or prison warden's) dog pack
would have been used to chase down *any* escaped
prisoner - of whatever color (or sex) - as well as
for recreational purposes (coon hunting, or other
scent-trail animal tracking) on weekends.  In fact,
these dogs (Redbones) are incredibly smart, and
they love people.  I've heard tell that when Redbone
packs are used to track escaped felons, the pack
handler has to put a German Shephard or other
aggressive dog in with them, to bite the bad guy
when the pack runs him down.  Redbones generally
won't bite anyone who doesn't need biting in a pretty
serious way.  (Someone threatening their family,
for instance.)  At any rate, I don't like to see my
favorite hounds getting bad press.  The &quot;coon&quot;
in &quot;coonhounds&quot; has *nothing* to do with black
people.  Period.

It most certainly is not.

Feral cats are an issue in many places in the US. The cats are not
really the moral actor here-people who throw Fluffy in the bushes when
s/he proves inconvenient are-but that is immaterial. I employ active
control methods against what are deadly predators who kill enormous
numbers of birds and wildlife each year.  I have no shame whatever for

Are claiming that you *ate* five or six thousand cats that you shot,
Ludwig? That is what natural killers do, they eat what they kill. If
you do not eat what you kill, you kill &quot;to enjoy a good slay&quot;, pure
bloodlust. That makes you despicable.

As for the other element of &quot;natural&quot;, a gun doesn't fit into it. I
would like to see you kill even one cat the natural way, Ludwig, with
your hands and teeth. I guarantee you will be blinded or dead before
ten cats, and you will never get to a hundred.

The only way an incompetent like you, Bret Ludwig, can &quot;win&quot; against
an animal, even one as small as a cat, is with a firearm in your hand
giving you overwhelming power applied from a safe distance. Face to
face on equal terms you would first be maimed and then eaten, Ludwig.

Bret Ludwig, you are a coward.

If you were not a mountebank of the highest order, you'd know that
cats stalk and kill a great number of small animals purely out of an
instinct to exercise their facilities. Small birds in particular, a
cat will ONLY hunt and kill if he is well fed and rested, because the
caloric value isn't worth the effort expended.  Even pet cats kill a
huge number of songbirds. That is tolerable, though unpleasant, to me.
Ferals doing it after being well fed by misguided &quot;cat lubbers&quot; is not
and such colonies, if they present themselves on real estate open to
me, tend to be decimated by my trusty AR-15, Remington 700BDL and my T-
C Contender and Encore.  Best effort so far on my part is 47 cats with
50 rounds of .223 commercial ball in something less than two minutes.

It's very possible to kill a small cat (Felis domesticus) with
nothing more than a large beach towel with relative safety, though you
stand a chance of an occasional clawing unless leather or heavy cotton
duck covering is worn. It is, however, a brutal act and one I would
find repellent in the extreme.

Very astute of you to fasten on that one point in this distasteful

Bret Ludwig corralled the 47 cats in a cage and shot them through the
fence, like shooting fish in a tank.

This claim also makes a lie of another bit of mealymouthing from this
vicious animal torturer Bret Ludwig. He claims that of the &quot;five or
six thousand&quot; cats he has killed, only &quot; half dozen did not die
instantly and without suffering&quot;. That is clearly a lie when in the
next breath Ludwig claims to have killed  &quot;47 cats... in... less than
two minutes.&quot; That's two and a perhaps a tiny fraction of a second per
cat, to identify a living cat, to aim, to fire, to reload.

It is pretty clear to anyone who has ever handled a firearm that there
were wounded cats screeching in pain dashing here and there, trying to
escape Bret Ludwig's killing cage, reducing the amount of time
available per cat to identify a living cat, to aim, to fire, to
reload, to well under two seconds, a viciious circle. I conclude that
probably more than half those 47 cats were wounded and in pain and
terror for a very long time. I have no problem whatsoever concluding
that Bret Ludwig set it up that way because he enjoys terrifying and
torturing small animals. Imagine the noise of 47 terrified and wounded
cats hurting: music to the ears of a sadist like Bret Ludwig.

Bret Ludwig is a crude butcher and a torturer of defenseless animals.
He tells us so himself if we have but ears to listen. But who listened
to those wounded, terrified cats in their last hour? That's a
conservative estimate of how long it would take to sort out a heap of
47 wounded and dead cats after such a botched butchery, and to kill
those too damaged to move but not yet dead. Ludwig would presumably do
it with the &quot;leather gauntlets and thick towel&quot; he tells us about
elsewhere in these disquieting threads (ask yourself how he knows
these tools so instantly), and you can imagine what slow work that
would be.

Doesn't America have a society for the prevention of cruelty to
animals?

&gt; Bret Ludwig corralled the 47 cats in a cage and shot them through the
&gt; fence, like shooting fish in a tank.

&gt; This claim also makes a lie of another bit of mealymouthing from this
&gt; vicious animal torturer Bret Ludwig. He claims that of the &quot;five or
&gt; six thousand&quot; cats he has killed, only &quot; half dozen did not die
&gt; instantly and without suffering&quot;. That is clearly a lie when in the
&gt; next breath Ludwig claims to have killed  &quot;47 cats... in... less than
&gt; two minutes.&quot; That's two and a perhaps a tiny fraction of a second per
&gt; cat, to identify a living cat, to aim, to fire, to reload.

&gt; It is pretty clear to anyone who has ever handled a firearm that there
&gt; were wounded cats screeching in pain dashing here and there, trying to
&gt; escape Bret Ludwig's killing cage, reducing the amount of time
&gt; available per cat to identify a living cat, to aim, to fire, to
&gt; reload, to well under two seconds, a viciious circle. I conclude that
&gt; probably more than half those 47 cats were wounded and in pain and
&gt; terror for a very long time. I have no problem whatsoever concluding
&gt; that Bret Ludwig set it up that way because he enjoys terrifying and
&gt; torturing small animals. Imagine the noise of 47 terrified and wounded
&gt; cats hurting: music to the ears of a sadist like Bret Ludwig.

&gt; Bret Ludwig is a crude butcher and a torturer of defenseless animals.
&gt; He tells us so himself if we have but ears to listen. But who listened
&gt; to those wounded, terrified cats in their last hour? That's a
&gt; conservative estimate of how long it would take to sort out a heap of
&gt; 47 wounded and dead cats after such a botched butchery, and to kill
&gt; those too damaged to move but not yet dead. Ludwig would presumably do
&gt; it with the &quot;leather gauntlets and thick towel&quot; he tells us about
&gt; elsewhere in these disquieting threads (ask yourself how he knows
&gt; these tools so instantly), and you can imagine what slow work that
&gt; would be.

&gt; Doesn't America have a society for the prevention of cruelty to

As much as I like domesticated cats, and have owned a few in the past,
I detest wild cats which are responsible for the slaughter of a large
tonnage
of national wild fauna. The last cat I had lived 18 years and only got
one bird,
and never another after I showed serious disapproval. She went on to be
quite a good ratter and mouser.

I detest all wild rabbits, horses, camels, donkeys, buffalo, dogs foxes
and pigs etc, etc which were not native to Oz.

Occasionally we see rumours of some very large cats out there in the
bush of Oz, wild pumas
that could easily kill a large kangaroo, or a sheep, maybe cattle and
horses a but nobody has ever got a good video.

The rabbits have been a very serious pest and have been in plague
numbers....
They live miserable lives and die in pain, and maybe its a wedgetailed
eagle that finalizes their life.

Trying to shoot 47 cats in 2 minutes is obviously a silly brag.
More like an hour would be needed to do the deed, unless you had a
machine gun.

When you think how much agony feral cats cause in the lives of other
animals,
if they don't die instantly, its not a major worry.
Still, I see no need to be cruel when disposing of unwanted animals.

Meanwhile, as the drought here continues on for 4+ years now, kangaroo
numbers have
increased and become an environmentally de-grading animal. There is an
ongoing row between
animal liberationists and the army and local gov which want to do some
serious culling.
The animal ppl have won round one so far.

But as I ride around in the springtime on the bicycle, and occasionally
drive the local country roads,
there are smells and dead kangaroos everywhere, maybe 2 a mile, and many
of these these animals died
lingering and painful deaths after being wounded by a car or truck. The
ones which died instantly
were the lucky ones.
The kangaroos are the main reason panel beaters get so much work....
The animal libbers don't wanna know about this. But not all they say is
silly.
They'd like to see all the caged hens allowed to roam in a yard, and big
changes in feed-lots..

There is much gross suffering imposed on animals unecessarily, and all
in the pursuit of profits.

My father, a cousin, and myself once visited a council tip one night
with a 22
and we shot 50 rats in 1/2 an hour, with one of us using a torch.
We have no idea of how many we wounded, leaving them to die in agony.
We ran out of amo, but my father who was an alderman trying to get the
tip converted to landfill
had a story to tell to the press and council in the following week.

That was 1958. Nowdays if you tried it, you'd get arrested and jailed.

There are of course the cat haters who hate ALL cats, and
cannot make the distinction between a feral cat that kills many wild
animals to survive,
and someone's dear old pet that isn't to blame for anything, as the cats
I owned in the past were.

Cat haters often hate women, police, tourists, back-packers, the taxman,
public servants, and have tattoos and a criminal record.

The outback of Oz is full of them.

One can rave on about who kills what, but frankly the worldwide
slaughter of people
in wars and in unjust regimes at present is somewhat more important than
a few cats.
Not to mention human road deaths, and pll shootinmg other ppl.

But there is no excuse for sadism and cruelty.

My father was also vet, and his routine monday workload meant visiting
the local Pound
and putting down many unwanted dogs and cats. I sometimes wonder why he
was so bad tempered,
but it must have had some effect to look at a row blameless critters in
the eye,
and take their life because nobody can give them any love. Like killing
orphans.

Then there were all the cats and dogs mowed down in car accidents.
We'd often sit down for dinner, the phone would ring, and dad would have
to be off to see a badly
injured animal. Often he'd return with a corpse.

Dad wasn't just bad tempered, but was a very practical bastard. Because
he was lumbererd with so many dead animals
from the practice of being a vet, corpse disposal was always a bother,
and cost a lot.
For awhile he tried cremation after building a brick furnace at the rear
of the business.
It was like Aushwitz in full swing at night, and rather hideous, and
with that smell,
but I helped him during school holidays and on some weekends.
One minute he'd be putting an animal down, next he'd be operating on one
to save its life,
or de-sexing it.
We had a huge vegetable garden, and 140 grape vines from which my dad
made 100 gallons of plonk in a good year.
He'd start a trench at one end and dump the bodies in each few days, dig
more trench and bury the days offerings.
Over about 7 years he filled the acre block. No wonder the ground was so
fertile.
And it all helped to pay for my Christian education.

The old method for de-sexing tom cats was to tie the animal in a hessian
bag tightly leaving tail and balls exposed
but limbs restrained from being able to fight back over what happened
next.

Innards of the balls were swiftly removed with a scalpel in about 10
seconds and maybe a stitch inserted,
but I don't remember too many stitches.
The cat made quite a verbal protest of course, but we expected that,
knowing in the fullness of time the
little bit of suffering was only temporary.
To make sure the cat wouldn't piss all over him while the operation took
place,
my dad had a knack for squeezing their bladder first and forcing them to
piss into a pot while growling
a bit before wrapping them up.
No mess.
Of course that kind of method isn't tolerated today either; the animal
must be aneasthetized.
But aneasthetic was expensive....

Girls get circumcized in Africa with appalling brutality. And tribal
customs amoung
Oz natives were rather painful. Be a man, be a woman, take it. Society
of the past
and at present in many parts of the world demands the young sustain pain
to mark their
progress of growing up.

Mum ran over two of our cats, and a dog she owned got killed on the
roads.

Life,pain,death,life,pain,death, and such is life.

Life in the suburbs isn't free of animal pain.
But you wouldn't want to be a farmer if you didn't like seeing pain.

I have amplifiers and speakers brought to me that cannot sing.

They look nervous on the bench. Valves rattle with a shiver, cones quake
with fright....

Out comes my hot soldering iron, side cutters, and long nose pliers.

They fuckin well learn to sing alright..... :-)

Oh, I don't think this is true at all. Mr. Ludwig is pretty
universally reviled and for very good reason.

However, he does know more about tubes, electronics and such-like than
you do, likely has forgotten much more than you ever will know. For
all that, he is still a malicious, hollow little creature. What it
gets down to is that the two of you are so much alike (pretentious,
posturing, nasty, hollow little creature vs. malicious, angry, hollow
little creature) that you *must* play out your vicious little games
for all to see. I clean up better than either of you when I run the
dogs, but you are so blind in your pretentions (the two of you) that,
again, you *must* engage each other.

Both of you really do need a life. Neither of you appear to have found

Under normal circumstances it would be very impossible to shoot ten
cats in two minutes. To be honest I didn't think Andrew was even
cognizant enough to bring that up.  My huge numbers were accomplished
with the aid of an AR-15 style heavy barrel rifle at a known range
from an elevation carefully plotted out, and it was a huge colony that
had proven resistant to other efforts-trapping and hauling to the
pound had been tried, the cats were extraordinarily wary because, one
of the misguided TNR groups had been active there.

Catnip had been planted earlier to make the area somewhat cat
friendly and they were habituated to the area, when in the middle of a
drought of sorts a dead pig was brought out along with a shallow tub
of water. I waited until the entire colony was having a rotten pig
fest and opened up, going through two 30 round magazines loaded with
25 rounds each.

Afterwards the dead pig (as much as could be scraped up) and the cats
were thrown into a pit, covered up and a tree planted, an eastern hard
rock maple. Hopefully it will make some lovely furniture, gunstock and
guitar wood when I am long since dead. The deceased critters will give
nourishment to the tree.

It was a performance I will never repeat, both because the barrel was
never the same again-it got very, very hot-and because a much better
method of large colony control has been found:

http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/2005/1429383.htm

I have not been involved in this type of thing but it makes a lot of
sense. It's humane, effective, and economic.

I would rather shoot prairie dogs and grackles and pigeons than cats,
to be honest. And starlings-the worst thing for North American native
songbirds there is, worse than feral cats even.

They don't get circumcized, they get clitoridectomied.  It's a brutal

horsewhipping the perpetrators in public, but that was racist,
fascist, imperialist, ad nauseum. So the practice resumed.

I think the abbos should be all sterilized (yes, use anesthetic)  and
allowed to live out their lives in comfort. Their IQ is around 55 on
average.  They will simply never fit in a Western society.  That

Oh Dear, I think I have to add what I forgot:-

Cat haters also hate gays, lesbians, muslims, jews, hippies, leftists,
greenies and all other minority
groups. Most cat haters hardly like anyone.

THEREFORE, the zombietime image referred to above as a friend of Bret
isn't a very
good example of a cat hater. Most happy nice mannered harmless
un-tattoed cock sucking gay guys
as shown in the above .jpg image quite like pussy providing it has 4
legs.
The feminine side of their personality allows some mental bond with the
feline mind, or cat mind.

Bret might not be your choice for r.a.t man of the year award, but
methinks its a trifle over the top to allege too much about his friends.

Although completely hetero myself, I have nothing against gays per se,
And if the world had 50% gay folks, the population growth would be
nicely slowed right down
and the greenhouse effect might be less likely to sweep our species away
during the next hundred years.

Well one could say that, and then say nobody is native to anywhere.

Are the Irish natives to Ireland?

There is evidence habitation by Homo Sapiens in Oz began about
3 ice ages ago, or 60,000 years.

Everyone comes from somewhere, and &quot;nativeness&quot; is an expression of the
length
of time one's ancestors have lived nearby.

The Europeans who came to settle in Oz are the invaders, and non native
peoples.

I do not imply anything moral or political by saying that, but
nature is nature, and because of the tendency of mankind to wander about
for
one reason or another, white folks gathered here from crowded Europe and
wanted more space.

As i see it, everyone in the world has equal rights to land, air, sea,
water, forest and every damn thing.

The natives of any land don't have any special rights.

( this is a mightily abused idea used to justify all sorts of wars and
mahem )

So where you have a land nearly the size of the US, and an almost
invisible population,
it was only natural for white folks who had lived in crowded places
elsewhere to arrive and say
&quot;Move over buster! I'm movin in!!&quot;
Locals rarely like moving or changeing, or sharing, so out comes the
gun, poison for the waterholes,
and bang bang! &quot;get the message now?&quot;

The Australian Aboriginies are still mightily upset how &quot;their&quot; land was
robbed from them,
and how their numbers were decimated by white folk's diseases and white
hunting parties.

White folks have a lot to be ashamed about.

There is NO nationally successful program to rid Oz of any of its pests

Diseases were invented for the rabbits, and myxomotosis wiped out
millions of rabbits;
they died horrible slow deaths. Then resistance bred up.

He lied to us while he stole the nation of Iraq. Ppl in the west will
eventually forgive him,
as long as he can't be blamed for starting WW3, or something that might
worry US folks just a little bit,

Millions of muslims won't forgive or forget George, and because of
George's interference with a well functioning
ruthless disgusting dictatorship, thousands of extra Iraqis have died,

I would indeed have a truly miserable life if I went around
trying to change the world. Its a largely very evil place.

I have no idea what all my customers get up to in their daily lives.
One customer recently murdered his father. He'd been a schizophrenic for
25 years
and had been on medications since 1983 when he would have been about 20.
In his attempt to &quot;go sraight&quot; and do it right, normal, without the mind
numbing
drugs, he of course didn't see his own demon, and in a brief rage
stabbed his father
25 times with a kitchen knife. He washed the knife carefully, and put it
back in the drawer.
His old mother, now a widow, was truly traumatized....

Should I have had no dealings with this man? Trade is just trade.
I once worked for a guy building a house who mentioned one day how much
he loved his daughter
of 13, and how he liked to talk to her sitting on her bed....
Months after I'd finished the job that girl's suicide was reported in
the local newspaper.
I thought it likely that he'd been rooting his daughter, and perhaps
that's why she quit life.

I love animals. In their place, the wild, or in human affairs when
managed properly.

Songbirds make the summer more pleasant. In the US, songbird
populations have been decimated by starlings, a pest species imported
by misguided Shakespeare fans 150 years ago, as well as feral cats.
So I help nature by thinning out these alien undesireable species.

I have never harmed anyone's pet cat, except one that crawled into
the fan shroud of my old International Harvester pickup some years
back. I didn't know it was there so when I started the engine it was
shredded. I felt bad about it, but the damage was done.

Ferals I have shot and shot and shot. it hasn't made a lot of
difference so in the future I intend to try this new Australian
method, which is to put a chemical in sausages that does little harm
to most species but which causes felids to fall asleep and die
painlessly. Hopefully this will prove the answer. At least the
songbirds hope so.

And man slept with his daughters in the Bible.

Tell 2pid to quit deriving sexual pleasure from the animals he

The difference between him and you is the &quot;by his own account&quot;. In
differentiating between layers and classes of scum, self-acknowledging
scum is well above pretentious, posturing scum.

Andre, little one, admit it. You and he need each other in the same
way an addict needs his fix. You engage each other with complete
predictability both in timing and results. You are merely different
manifestations of the same disease.
