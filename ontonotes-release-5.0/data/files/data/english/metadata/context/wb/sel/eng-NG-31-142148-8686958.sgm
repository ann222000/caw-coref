Turkey refuses to implement the decision of the ECHR on the Myra
Xenides-Aresti case

Turkish Cypriot daily Volkan newspaper (24.08.07) reports that Turkey
is not paying the compensation of 885 thousand euros to Greek Cypriot
refugee, Myra Xenides-Aresti, who had filed a lawsuit against Ankara at
the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ordered Turkey to pay
compensation to Mrs Aresti and give her back her house in the occupied
city of Varosha.

The paper notes that in spite of the fact that the deadline given to
Turkey for compensating Mrs Aresti ended yesterday, Ankara did not pay
the compensation. Turkey rejected also the return of the house, which
Aresti claims that belongs to her, but documents proved that belongs to
the Abdullah Pasha Foundation, reports VOLKAN noting that Mrs Aresti
will complain about the issue to the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe in October.

Why can't you see both sides of the coin? Turks cannot sell their property
in the South because the Greek Cypriot government has outlawed it.Greeks
cannot sell their property in the North because the Greek Cypriot Government
has outlawed it. They cannot exchange their land because the Greek Cypriot
government has outlawed it. Turks cannot even collect their dividends from
companies operating in South Cyprus because of so called legislation passed
by the Greek Cypriot government. The money is deposited in some fund which
Greek Cypriot banks exploit to make fat profits while Turkish Cypriots whose
money it is cannot use their own money sitting in such funds. Take KEO, the
distillery where a lot of Turks owned shares having bought the shares in
exchange for grapes delivered to KEO. They own the shares but in name only.
No dividends can be paid to Turkish Cypriot owners of those shares.

Why can't  you begin to see the other side of the coin? These are problems
that have got to be addressed if ever there is going to be an agreed
solution to the Cyprus issue. Otherwise the current de facto partition will
become more and more permanent. Can't you see this much?

The way I see it, there will not be an agreed solution of the Cyprus problem
until such time as Turkey is also in the EU and even then it will have to be
a federal solution. You just cannot upset the people all over again and
resettle them. You can count that out. There will have to be some free
exchange of immovable property with may be a small percentage of people
being able to go back to their former homes.

Look, I have no personal stake in the Cyprus issue but common sense  tells
me that there is no other solution satisfactory to both sides. I remember a
Greek Cypriot friend of mine telling me that he had voted against the Annan
plan and my response was that I wished he had voted FOR it.  If ever a
solution is going to be reached to the satisfaction of both parties, then it
will have to be a realistic one in keeping with the realities of the day.
The chances of that happening are minimal, the way I see it before Turkey is
also a member of the EU.  Turkey's membership of the EU will ease the way to
a settlement providing there is less intransigence on both sides. The way I
see it is that at the moment it is the Greek side that is being intransigent
because they can't be realistic about the whole issue.

One day, hopefully, there will be a solution on a federal basis and this
might even gradually lead to more porous boundaries as they inevitably will
once both sides of the border are within the EU.

It doesn't take much brain power to see this but it takes civil courage on
behalf of the leadership of both sides. And mark my words, Cyprus is not
merely a Cypriot problem but a Greco-Turkish issue. And saying Cyprus is
Greek and will forever remain Greek is not going to solve the problem. It
will only entrench the Greco-Turkish division.

I know some of you will not like what I have said but if you really could
sit down and think rationally you will soon realize that what I am saying is
the only way to solve the Cyprus issue.

Because that would be rewarding aggression and facilitating ethnic cleaning.

There is not other side of the coin. This a simple case of illegal

Rubbish. There are still over 200,000 Greek Cypriots living in refugee
camps. 160,000 Turkish Colonists have been brought to occupied Cyprus in
violations of the Geneva Convention and they outnumber the Turkish Cypriot
by 2 to 1. The only solution is for the colonists to be deported and for
everyone to return to their original homes. 90% of the land and property in
occupied Cyprus is owned by Greek Cypriots and there is no basis whatsoever
for a federation, only majority rule with the protection of minority rights.
If you want a federation then give it to the Kurds who occupy 1/3 of Turkey
before you start asking for one in Cyprus for a 10% minority.

WRONG. If all the Greek Cypriot refugees were allowed to return to all the
villages they formed the majority in over 96% of them would be able to
return to their home under Greek Cypriot control. The fact is that only 66%
of Turkish Cypriots lived in villages with a Turkish Cypriots majority.

ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. If Turkey were allowed to join the EU it would never agree
to a solution and would occupy Cyprus forever and never allow a single Greek
Cypriot to return.

What is needed is more EU pressure on Turkey including a naval and air
blockade of the occupied areas so that Turkey and their Turkish Cypriot
collaborators and war criminals are starved into submission to international
law. Within 6 months of an embargo being established all of Turkeys troops
on the island would starve to death.

Are you being serious?  Once Turkey is also in the EU there will be freedom
of movement under EU rules. So how can anyone be stopped from living in an
area of their choice within the EU?  I know there were certain restrictions
on the populations of the recent new EU member states moving say to the UK
etc but those restrictions were imposed only for a limited temporary  period
of time. As far as I know since I am an EU citizen, temporary rules barring,
I can go and settle down and work in any part of the EU. Nobody can stop me.

Which incidentally gives the lie to your claims. Turkish firms are investing
in Greece and Greek firms are investing in Turkey. A Turkish bank recently
changed hands. Or haven't you heard?

Are you living with your head buried in the sand? That's the trouble with
you narrow minded nationalists. Wakey, wake-up!!!

I know that the idea of a European Federation is not so hot at the moment
but it will come as it must. One problem with Europe though is that there
are too many states and languages involved. I for one wouldn't mind if all
Europeans adopted one or just a few languages as the official language/s of
the EU. I am not one of those romantics living in cloud cuckoo land who
think that every single language or dialect must be preserved. Eventually
and hopefully one or just a few handful of languages will win in the end or
at least they will all agree on ONE foreign language so that people will not
have to learn more that two languages to be able to communicate with one
another right across the EU no matter where they live.

Esperanto was once such a hope for the whole world but they killed it.
English probably is the best candidate for a Europe-wide second language all
Europeans can learn. If anyone wants to study Catalan some other minority
language, let them do so but Europe needs ONE common language to cut across
all the red tape.

But the problem with Europe is that people are still not feeling that they
are Europeans first and foremost with their ethnicity coming second to their
Europeanness. Neo-Fascism and neo-Nazism still rear their ugly heads here,
there and everywhere; witness the recent incidents in Germany. It is a shame
but there we are. We have not wiped out Nazism or racism and nor are we
going to if attitudes do not change.

And if you do not like what I am saying, truth is never very popular.
Remember that!

&gt; Let's just take one case here and prove that you are bullshitting, re

&gt; You say...

&gt;&gt;&gt; The chances of that happening are minimal, the way I see it before
&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkey is also a member of the EU.  Turkey's membership of the EU will
&gt;&gt;&gt; ease the way to a settlement providing there is less intransigence on
&gt;&gt;&gt; both sides. The way I see it is that at the moment it is the Greek side
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is being intransigent because they can't be realistic about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole issue.

&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. If Turkey were allowed to join the EU it would never
&gt;&gt; agree to a solution and would occupy Cyprus forever and never allow a
&gt;&gt; single Greek Cypriot to return.

&gt; Are you being serious?  Once Turkey is also in the EU there will be
&gt; freedom of movement under EU rules. So how can anyone be stopped from
&gt; living in an area of their choice within the EU?  I know there were
&gt; certain restrictions
">

Look at the Annan Plan where all Greek Cypriots had their right to settle in
the north completely abrogated along with all of their other basic human
rights, including the right to do business as Turkey demanded. Under the
Annan Plan Greek Cypriots would not have even been able to have children.

&gt; on the populations of the recent new EU member states moving say to the UK
&gt; etc but those restrictions were imposed only for a limited temporary
&gt; period of time. As far as I know since I am an EU citizen, temporary rules
&gt; barring, I can go and settle down and work in any part of the EU. Nobody
&gt; can stop me.

But the Annan Plan would stop me.

&gt; Which incidentally gives the lie to your claims. Turkish firms are

We are talking about Cyprus. Why hasn't the Cypriot owner of the largest
stake in Turkeys main telephone company been paid the dividend he is owned
for his shares?

Turkey cannot be trusted to respect human rights. It has already ethnically
cleansed or murdered over 8 million Greeks who lived in Asia Minor and
confiscated their land and property including the 1 million Greeks who used
to inhabit Constantinople so that less than 2,000 are now left. Why is it
still confiscating land from the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch and refusing
to recognise his title and reopen the Theological School on Halki. Turkey
wants to exterminate every last Greek and every last trace of their religion
and culture and it wants to do exactly the same to the Kurds.

&gt; Are you living with your head buried in the sand? That's the trouble with

&gt; I know that the idea of a European Federation is not so hot at the moment
&gt; but it will come as it must. One problem with Europe though is that there
&gt; are too many states and languages involved. I for one wouldn't mind if all
&gt; Europeans adopted one or just a few languages as the official language/s
&gt; of the EU. I am not one of those romantics living in cloud cuckoo land who
&gt; think that every single language or dialect must be preserved. Eventually
&gt; and hopefully one or just a few handful of languages will win in the end
&gt; or at least they will all agree on ONE foreign language so that people
&gt; will not have to learn more that two languages to be able to communicate
&gt; with one another right across the EU no matter where they live.

&gt; Esperanto was once such a hope for the whole world but they killed it.
&gt; English probably is the best candidate for a Europe-wide second language
&gt; all Europeans can learn. If anyone wants to study Catalan some other
&gt; minority language, let them do so but Europe needs ONE common language to
&gt; cut across all the red tape.

&gt; But the problem with Europe is that people are still not feeling that they
&gt; are Europeans first and foremost with their ethnicity coming second to
&gt; their Europeanness. Neo-Fascism and neo-Nazism still rear their ugly heads
&gt; here, there and everywhere; witness the recent incidents in Germany. It is
&gt; a shame but there we are. We have not wiped out Nazism or racism and nor
&gt; are we going to if attitudes do not change.

&gt; And if you do not like what I am saying, truth is never very popular.
&gt; Remember that!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkey refuses to implement the decision of the ECHR on the Myra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Xenides-Aresti case

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkish Cypriot daily Volkan newspaper (24.08.07) reports that Turkey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is not paying the compensation of 885 thousand euros to Greek Cypriot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; refugee, Myra Xenides-Aresti, who had filed a lawsuit against Ankara
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ordered Turkey to pay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compensation to Mrs Aresti and give her back her house in the occupied
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; city of Varosha.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The paper notes that in spite of the fact that the deadline given to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turkey for compensating Mrs Aresti ended yesterday, Ankara did not pay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the compensation. Turkey rejected also the return of the house, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aresti claims that belongs to her, but documents proved that belongs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Abdullah Pasha Foundation, reports VOLKAN noting that Mrs Aresti
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will complain about the issue to the Committee of Ministers of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Council of Europe in October.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ???? ??.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??????, ?? ???????? ??? ?? ????? ?????, ? ???;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why can't you see both sides of the coin? Turks cannot sell their
&gt;&gt;&gt; property in the South because the Greek Cypriot government has outlawed
&gt;&gt;&gt; it.Greeks

&gt;&gt; So that they don't get ripped off and because they are being used as
&gt;&gt; refugee camps since Turkey and its barbaric occupations force will not
&gt;&gt; allowed the Greek Cypriots to return to their homes in the north and have
&gt;&gt; deliberately murdered Greek Cypriots such as Tasos Isaac and Solomos
&gt;&gt; Solomou who wished to do so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot sell their property in the North because the Greek Cypriot
&gt;&gt;&gt; Government has outlawed it.

&gt;&gt; How can they sell their properties when they are illegally occupied and
&gt;&gt; Greek Cypriots are prevented from taking possession of them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;They cannot exchange their land because the Greek Cypriot

&gt;&gt; Because that would be rewarding aggression and facilitating ethnic
&gt;&gt; cleaning. It's like a Mafia bombing your restaurant, forcing you out of
&gt;&gt; business and threatening your life so as to force you to sell your
&gt;&gt; property to them cheep so they can make a huge profit. This is called
&gt;&gt; extortion and racketeering.

&gt;&gt;&gt; government has outlawed it. Turks cannot even collect their dividends
&gt;&gt;&gt; from companies operating in South Cyprus because of so called
&gt;&gt;&gt; legislation passed by the Greek Cypriot government. The money is
&gt;&gt;&gt; deposited in some fund which Greek Cypriot banks exploit to make fat
&gt;&gt;&gt; profits while Turkish Cypriots whose money it is cannot use their own
&gt;&gt;&gt; money sitting in such funds. Take KEO, the distillery where a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Turks owned shares having bought the shares in exchange for grapes
&gt;&gt;&gt; delivered to KEO. They own the shares but in name only. No dividends can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be paid to Turkish Cypriot owners of those shares.

&gt;&gt; Bullshit. Dividends are paid but because the banks in the occupied areas
&gt;&gt; are operating illegally they cannot be cased. If you come to the free
&gt;&gt; areas then you can easily case you dividend cheque.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why can't  you begin to see the other side of the coin? These are
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems

&gt;&gt; There is not other side of the coin. This a simple case of illegal
&gt;&gt; aggression, ethnic cleansing, occupations and colonisation in violation
&gt;&gt; of the UN Charter, UN Security Council Resolutions, The European
&gt;&gt; Convention of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention and there is only
&gt;&gt; one solutions and that is for Turkey to comply with the above and get out
&gt;&gt; of Cyprus and take all of its illegal troops and colonists with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; that have got to be addressed if ever there is going to be an agreed
&gt;&gt;&gt; solution to the Cyprus issue. Otherwise the current de facto partition
&gt;&gt;&gt; will become more and more permanent. Can't you see this much?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I see it, there will not be an agreed solution of the Cyprus
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem until such time as Turkey is also in the EU and even then it
&gt;&gt;&gt; will have to be a federal solution. You just cannot upset the people all
&gt;&gt;&gt; over again and resettle them. You can count that out. There will have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be some free

&gt;&gt; Rubbish. There are still over 200,000 Greek Cypriots living in refugee
&gt;&gt; camps. 160,000 Turkish Colonists have been brought to occupied Cyprus in
&gt;&gt; violations of the Geneva Convention and they outnumber the Turkish
&gt;&gt; Cypriot by 2 to 1. The only solution is for the colonists to be deported
&gt;&gt; and for everyone to return to their original homes. 90% of the land and
&gt;&gt; property in occupied Cyprus is owned by Greek Cypriots and there is no
&gt;&gt; basis whatsoever for a federation, only majority rule with the protection
&gt;&gt; of minority rights. If you want a federation then give it to the Kurds
&gt;&gt; who occupy 1/3 of Turkey before you start asking for one in Cyprus for a
&gt;&gt; 10% minority.

&gt;&gt;&gt; exchange of immovable property with may be a small percentage of people
&gt;&gt;&gt; being able to go back to their former homes.

&gt;&gt; WRONG. If all the Greek Cypriot refugees were allowed to

Drexl, not sure if you came across that post yesterday that was crossposted
to &quot;talk.politics.european-union&quot;. There's a very good new article online
showing how some people (among them Churchill) see the Turks.

They discovered new material (photos from the German Deutsche Bank)
corroborating the Armenian Genocide. Gives a good overview of the special
Turkish character trait and their special &quot;Turkish way&quot; of massacring
people: http://tinyurl.com/3yjvae

I wish every single person on the planet would read the article and learn
about the Turks' disgusting hypocrisy!

&gt; &gt; That would imply I'm mental. But hating Turks is normal behavior. Just

&gt; &gt; the list goes on................

&gt; &gt; They all hate them Turks, and that would make most people on the
&gt; &gt; planet. You see, you should see a shrink, unless you hate yourself.

&gt; &gt; &quot;For a nation of pigs, it sures is funny you don't eat'em! Jesus
&gt; &gt; Christ forgave the bastards, but I can't! I hate! I hate you! I hate
&gt; &gt; your nation! And I hate your people! And I fuck your sons and
&gt; &gt; daughters because they're pigs! You're a pig! You're all pigs. &quot;

&gt; Drexl, not sure if you came across that post yesterday that was crossposted
&gt; to &quot;talk.politics.european-union&quot;. There's a very good new article online
&gt; showing how some people (among them Churchill) see the Turks.

&gt; They discovered new material (photos from the German Deutsche Bank)
&gt; corroborating the Armenian Genocide. Gives a good overview of the special
&gt; Turkish character trait and their special &quot;Turkish way&quot; of massacring
&gt; people: http://tinyurl.com/3yjvae

Thanks!

It's really amazing that the Turks think they can somehow deny this
genocide when the whole world seems to know damn well what happened.
They really are very stupid indeed!

==============================================================
To the Turks, everything is &quot;shurla burla&quot;, which means &quot;like this,
like that&quot;.
You never know what will happen. All foreigners are &quot;ayip&quot;, they're
considered dirty.
So is homosexuality, it's a big crime here, but most of them do it
every chance they get.
