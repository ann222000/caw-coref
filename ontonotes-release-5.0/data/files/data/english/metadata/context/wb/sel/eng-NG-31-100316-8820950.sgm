Today's &quot;Business Standard&quot;  Daily  has reported quoting a Department of
IT, Govt. of India official saying that a Note for the Union Cabinet's
consideration was under preparation to push for extnding the tax sops for
the sector beyond Apr 2009.

This may or may not fructify. But, if the Indian Rupee continues to
appreciate, then the IT Ministry will have a strong case to push for
extension of tax sops, as otherwise the IT industry will suffer from the
twin impact of Rupee appreciation and increase in tax rates.

*The market appears to have concluded that the discontinuation of tax sops
post FY09 is a done deal - any positive suprise here could cause *
*HUGE RERATING FOR THE SECTOR.

Given that the sector valuations have priced in a lot of negatives (such as
Rupee Appreciation, US recession, Margin pressures, Increase in Tax rates
post FY09 and not a play on India Growth Story), *and given that the street
is very bearish on the sector with most investors underweight/short in the
sector, and in view of attractive valuations, we continue to recommend
buying IT despite sharp spurt in last 2 days.
*

*Any positive surprise (such as slower than expected Rupee appreciation or
lower than expected tax rate post FY10 or any major M&amp;A in the sector or
strong 2QFY08 numbers)  could cause huge rerating of the sector.
*

*The valuation sheet is attached herewith.*

*Top picks: TCS, Infosys, Satyam &amp; HCL Tech
Midcaps: NIIT Tech, Mphasis, First Source
