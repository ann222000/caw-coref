Donald Rumsfeld sent a memo to four of his associates in the
Department of Defense on October 16 that worried about how the US is
doing in the war on terror. He admitted that there was little in the way
of a measurement for progress, but worried that the US had shown
insufficient boldness.. He worried that many al-Qaeda operatives still
eluded the US, and wondered whether the Pentagon can be reconfigured
fast enough to catch them. He also admitted that Iraq and Afghanistan
will be a "long hard slag," and that not as much progress had been made
in apprehending top Taliban officials as had been in capturing the top
55 Baathists in Iraq.

On the other hand, the politics of the memo's release are suspicious.
Did Rumsfeld worry that the Bush/Rice "It's Morning in Iraq" PR campaign
made the administration look pollyannaish and naive? Did he feel a dose
of realism would actually help the administration with the US public? Is
he making the point that Condi's elevation to head of the Iraq
coordination effort is irrelevant, since he is still in charge of Big
Think at the powerful Pentagon?
