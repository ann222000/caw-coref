Asia a casualty of the Iraq war
By Haseenah Koyakutty

When the &quot;surge&quot; is fully debated, the US troops go home, the war is
ended and the losses counted, an unexpected casualty of the Iraq war
could end up being Asia. America's long-standing relations with Asia
are steadily going up in smoke.

The administration of US President George W Bush upset the 10 leaders
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by recently
calling off plans to attend the commemorative US-ASEAN summit planned
for September. The reason: that's a decisive month in the war in Iraq.

No one in the administration foresaw that the September 5 summit in
Singapore was going to conflict with General David Petraeus' report
card on the &quot;surge&quot; of US troops in Iraq. The congressional calendar
is predictable, even if politics is not, and the 10 heads of
government in Southeast Asia are being stood up over what is
apparently a scheduling glitch.

The diplomatic bungling would not have been so disappointing if the
meeting were routine. But this is no mere dress rehearsal. The
inaugural summit was meant to celebrate and cement 30 years of US-
ASEAN ties.

Bush still plans to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meeting in Sydney in September. But the decision to snub ASEAN
fits a larger pattern. Although the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) brings
together an A-list of 26 regional leaders to talk real business, US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice decided not to attend in 2005.
She was the first US secretary of state to send her deputy to a
meeting in which China, Japan, India, Myanmar and even North Korea
participate.

Washington had never treated the ARF this way since its inception in
1994, and the faux pas made for flashy headlines. The Bush
administration scrambled to make amends and argue that it was still a
player in the region. Skeptics, however, doubted the administration's
seriousness of purpose. Their misgivings turned out to be prescient.
Rice has again sent a deputy to the ARF that is taking place in
Manila this week.

Rice's passing over of yet another Asian jamboree may seem minor in
the scheme of foreign-policy issues confronting the United States and
its beleaguered administration. But consider this: ASEAN is a bigger
export market for US products than China. Yet the US chose to be
absent from the 2005 ASEAN economic ministers' meeting held in the
Laotian capital, Vientiane. The US is also not part of the ASEAN + 3
annual gatherings that connect ASEAN with its three Northeast Asian
partners, China, Japan and South Korea.

Finally, the United States has been excluded from several recent
multilateral initiatives. The new continentwide East Asia Summit,
which has welcomed Australia and New Zealand but not the US, may lack
substance for now, but it represents half of the world's population.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is another rising bloc in
Central Asia that briefly got Washington's attention in 2005 when it
issued a timeline for US forces to pull out of Uzbekistan.

Taken together, a discernable pattern is emerging - of no-shows and
US invisibility - no matter what the Bush administration says about
engaging Asia.

Yes, the United States has fought three wars in Asia. It has built a
vast network of multiple alliances over time. But habitual absences
and lower-level representation at critical forums dilute the message,
even if the messenger is Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte,
who is attending the ARF in Rice's place. Culturally, the
substitution will go down as contempt. In short, missteps, missed
opportunities, and miscalculations have slowly come to shape
America's Asia policy.

The implications are far-reaching. The United States has few friends,
and it should keep the ones who wish it well. Rather than a &quot;second
front&quot; in the &quot;war on terror&quot;, Southeast Asia has become a back-
burner issue for the Bush administration. Rice once labeled Myanmar
an &quot;outpost of tyranny&quot;. If difficult diplomacy is yielding progress
in North Korea, the same patience and care can be pursued elsewhere.

In real terms, these high-level meetings in faraway places make a
difference when the US wants Asia to buy its products. Should Harley-
Davidsons or Japanese motorcycles flood the consumption-crazy Asian
market? What about pushing against compulsory licenses in the
pharmaceutical sector? America's voice on weighty global issues will
not likely carry weight. As it is, only the political elite in a
dwindling number of Asian countries cares to listen to what the US
has to say.

Strategically speaking, no one yet knows what kind of political and
security architecture is going to emerge in the Asia-Pacific region.
It will, however, coalesce with or without the US. For all of ASEAN's
bureaucratic shortcomings and penchant for ceremony, Vietnamese
President Nguyen Minh Triet rightly observed during his recent visit
to Washington that ASEAN is today more cohesive, and its
institutional partnerships with China, Japan, the European Union, and
a host of middle powers are growing.

In a major milestone, ASEAN will soon unveil a new rules-based ASEAN
Charter at its annual November summit that it hopes will make it as
grounded in legal certainty as the European Union.

The United States can help strengthen reform-minded institutions and,
together with its allies, tackle problems where interests converge,
such as Myanmar. Or the United States can go it alone. If a power
vacuum arises in Asia, other countries at ASEAN's doorstep are
certainly willing to step in.

The US State Department acknowledges that relations with ASEAN are
&quot;rough right now&quot;, but it is &quot;something we can recover from&quot;.

Maybe. In another era.

Law and gag order
Helen Ang Aug 2, 07 1:13pm .

Once upon a time, the Congress Party under Indira Gandhi ran an
election slogan `India is Indira and Indira is India'. The Congress
leader in addition to being a long-serving Prime Minister was the
daughter and mother of India's PMs, respectively its first Jawaharlal
Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi (following her assassination).

Mao Ze Dong also projected himself as China, and political parties
which have held the reins of power in perpetuity unchallenged tend to
hold to the same formula.

Barisan Nasional brackets itself similarly in the national psyche.
But increasingly large numbers of people are rejecting the `BN is
Malaysia and Malaysia is BN' sloganeering. The distinction is clear
that to be anti-BN is not to be disloyal to king and country.

De facto law minister – Nazri Aziz of Umno (the equation `Umno is BN
and BN is Umno' holds true enough though) – last week warned
Malaysians: `Belittle the king or Islam and you face the music'.

This loud music could be as jarring as life in prison for offences
against the authority of the king or sultans, Nazri's party
mouthpiece the New Straits Times helpfully reminded us.

If desperate times call for desperate measures, Umno must be
desperate indeed to invoke treason and blasphemy, and threatening the
full force of our plentiful laws on vocal citizens it has cast as
enemies of the state.

And as if the present plethora of laws, including the Penal Code's
life sentence is still inadequate, Nazri announced that the
government is further mulling new laws to monitor and act against
bloggers. What does he propose as maximum penalty – death by hanging?

I need not spell out `fig leaf' as indecent cover for naked ambition.
Assuredly if the government desires to act against bloggers, it will.
If it wants to ferret out their identity, it will too.

But the critics might be abroad and no longer Malaysian – cyberspace
is borderless after all – and thus at a further reach from the
government that treats its citizens as enemies.

And looking at continued postings in Malaysia Today following Umno's
police report against it, the news portal's readership is not cowed.

The world is watching

As leverage against BN, public opinion must render too high the
political cost of actions in the mould of Operasi Lallang so that
Umno cannot resort to intimidation at will.

The incipient crackdown on Net writers might have already misfired.
Taking PKR webmaster Nathaniel Tan into police custody generated
negative publicity detrimental to the government.

Moreover, the economic cost of mis-governance keeps foreign investors
away as well as slips Malaysia down many notches in global indices on
various developmental rankings. Their cumulative effect bears on
Malaysia's image as an unreliable place to do business.

Realising this backlash, the powers-that-be quickly made a course
correction, steering to Islamic waters.

It's been found understandably that Tan's alleged OSA offence of
hyperlinking to a corruption expose contained an in-built
obsolescence because the government, after high-level investigations,
decidedly found that high-level corruption is non-existent.

So it switched tack to the country's purely `internal affairs' of
Islam and the king with its target number two, Raja Petra Kamaruddin.

Raja Petra has robustly tackled reports on corruption in Malaysia
Today. One of his past articles on conversion to Islam themed `Hotel
California' is a must-read for any non-Muslim woman here desiring to
marry a Malay man.

But it is Malaysia Today's highly interactive format of publishing
readers' posts that is furnishing the pretext for the government
dragnet.

Some recognisable names in Malaysian blogosphere belong to
politicians, lawyers and ex-journalists. Some of these are pro-
establishment and unaffected by the government's threat to clamp down
on blogs.

These categories are political if you accept the reasoning that there
are more lawyers and law graduates in Parliament compared to any
other profession, while the former journos naturally possess a
familiarity with `Malaysia, Truly Politics' that their long careers
in mainstream entail.

The `non' categories would be Netizens without any background of
political involvement or taint. They may be young people expressing
themselves or just about anyone who participates in cybercafé or
kopitiam talk without having the deep pocket or inclination to
weather a spell in detention at the pleasure of our `Islamic State'
government.

If police were to suddenly cart them away, unsuspecting parents and
families would be shell-shocked. The loved ones of political
activists are at least prepared for the eventuality of arrest.

Since the stakes have been raised higher, perhaps Netizens too are
now reflecting on how far they are political, not in the sense of
actively politicking but how much it means to them to voice political
opinions which is only their legitimate right.

It was in a way fortunate for Tan that he is affiliated with PKR and
had the requisite contacts so that police did not misplace the key
after throwing him into lock-up. It is certainly good that more
Malaysians are becoming politically conscious and a better thing for
the opposition parties to harness this awareness among non-political
bloggers and their readership.

Perhaps the opposition should create a common platform to engage
bloggers, which is not to say endeavour to sign them up with any
particular party. What this non-partisan outreach would afford is the
networking or helpline such that solo guys tapping away at a home
keyboard can call upon in a crunch.

No escape from politics

For the government to pass the anti-bloggers laws that Nazri hinted
at requires a two-thirds majority in parliament. To deny the bills
passage, more than one third of MPs must vote against it – if they
elect to spurn the party line.

They did not when Article 121 of the Federal Constitution was amended.

Malaysians can't pin any better hopes either on appointed
representatives in Dewan Negara; when Nazri told the assembly that it
is time to act against bloggers who flout the law, the Senators
cheered, according to NST's report.

As evidenced by this yet another instance of Umno swinging its big
stick, we really have no choice but to be `political' as a matter of
self-preservation. The general election is only but a small start; it
has to be a sustained project.

With anti-establishment sentiments intensifying, Umno urgently needs
to put a lid on the bubbling cauldron where the mutterings of
discontent are finding place. This is to prevent Thoughtcrime against
BN's manufactured consensus on approved worldview.

Its diversionary tactics is to label alternative media as
irresponsible and reeking of racism, an allegation Deputy Prime
Minister Najib Razak made speaking at Malaysian Media Night 2007.

Raising concerns over the behaviour of Islamic authorities is not
Islamophobia as Umno and its punkahwallahs would have it. It is a
grave worry about the untrammelled encroachment upon shared values of
universal human rights. The oblique charge of racial chauvinism
against those critical of our religious establishment is a
Machiavellian and stale strategy.

As nasty and distasteful as Chinese chauvinism is on the social
front, Chinese supremacists are not the ones calling the shots in the
administration of this country, not by a long shot. It is not even
remotely plausible that they impose or implement any sort of official
policy on the `Chinese religion' – whatever one figures Chinese
worship exactly to be – that infringes on Muslim space.

For the sake of argument, let's admit MCA is a chauvinistic entity
because communalism is inbuilt into the BN template. The cold, hard
fact is Umno Youth easily have Ong Ka Ting and his assorted limp
biscuits for lunch and make a low-calorie snack of them at that.

The Chinese minority, dwindling fast and significantly, are an
imagined threat conjured up by Umno. The real threat is the Malay
ground shifting away from the party.

Malays are outgrowing Umno and it is crucially they who have the
capacity to subvert the BN hegemony. Hence the political distraction
directing to the Malay's chief identity marker – religion.

Islam is an unshakeable world faith that does not need champions the
likes of Malaysia's political elite. Especially not ones armed with
keris and wearing fig leaves.

helen brought up a valid point ie the chinese community is dwindling due to smaller families. this is the same with indian families- more and more families have 1 -3 kids only. this is a worldwide trend whereby education makes families to have smaller families except in catholic philipines and south america where religion prohibits family planning. in this catholics and muslims are united as their religions encourages big families. during one population conference the Vatican and Iran were united despite their difference in religion. the problems of overpopulation leading to inadequate food,shelter and other needs of people are not given prominence by the vatican.

so, coming to malaysia, at  this rate, the proportion of chinese and indians in malaysia will come down. so umno dont have to worry about the chinese and indian malaysians. they know that well but are not telling he truth to the malays. I think umno is doing a disservice to malays by keeping them minds in seige preventing the natural talents of malays to blossom. malays are people like anybody else in the world. it is amtter of allowing their natural ablities and talents to flourish.  (frankly, as as socialist i dont suscribe to racial theories. it is the absence of education and other infrastructures that has left some people behind. but i also agree that there is some truth in genetics. this can solved by preventing marriages among close relatives such as cousins.)

the east asian communities ie chinese, koreans, japanese and vietnamese have achieved  tremendous success on par with the west. whats their secret? surely malaysia can duplicate that success here. i wont be surprised if somebody does a study  and reveal the fact that it is lousy politics that keeps many people around the world backward and not race.

Actually it is the cultural mileau intertwined with adaptation and how much of that has to do with genetics, we honestly do not know yet. The brain and our genes interact in such ways we have yet to understand.

Maybe Gnh can enlightnen us huh ?

As for dwindling Chinese and Indian families, on the other hand, Malay families, apart from the rural pre-dominance, are encouraged to have large families given governmental support for healthcare and education, and employment.

But even then, what about immigration ? They are letting in Indonesians and Filipinos by the thousands in certain areas to gain electoral control.

let in enough Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis and Myanmarese and Cambodians and others and maybe chinese then the population also shift what.

What if the non-Malay men in this country were marry Chinese women from CHina or Vietnamese women and if they were brought in to Malaysia, they have to stay here and their children would be Malaysians no ? And if the Chinese men were to have taken 2nd and 3rd and 4th wives in serial polygamy - would that not work against the Grand  UMNO Demographic Plan !!

Now we know what Gnh is up to ? Seed the country with his genes with international participation !

Condi  Rice is delibrately playing down Asean due to Myanmar and the fact that Asean is negotiating from a position of weakness. USA  has signed separate free trade agreement with singapore and korea. it is working on thailand. this separate free trade reflects the internal differences of asean. Asean is not  like EU or a single big nation like china and india which USA CAN'T afford to ignore. asean  is loud on words but weak on actions. the internal politics of the nations in Asean is also a draw. this is a job for the leaders of asean. blaming USA may win votes in local elections but that is not policy and worse USA may not  take asean seriously. as for trade, americans are cocksure of their technology and its products are welcomed by consumers worldwide.

we cant fool the americans in trade. students of history will know that the docking of 4 USA warships at tokyo bay in 1863 opened up Japan to world trade and the japanese ahve not looked back. to make matters worse for asean and many other nations, USA is attracting the best talents worldover thereby enhancing its leadership in innovation.

For all of ASEAN's bureaucratic shortcomings and penchant for ceremony, Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet rightly observed during his recent visit to Washington that ASEAN is today more cohesive, and its institutional partnerships with China, Japan, the European Union, and a host of middle powers are growing.

In a major milestone, ASEAN will soon unveil a new rules-based ASEAN Charter at its annual November summit that it hopes will make it as grounded in legal certainty as the European Union.

The United States can help strengthen reform-minded institutions and, together with its allies, tackle problems where interests converge, such as Myanmar. Or the United States can go it alone. If a power vacuum arises in Asia, other countries at ASEAN's doorstep are certainly willing to step in.

The US State Department acknowledges that relations with ASEAN are &quot;rough right now&quot;, but it is &quot;something we can recover from&quot;.

Maybe. In another era.

leaving genetics aside, chinese and indian women have become aware of their rights . so  serial polygamy is out. even if u take wives from vietnam and china, they will also want smaller families. i dont think state support will encourage bigger families for chinese and indians. in some countries, eg australia- state support is to replace existing population ratio as many western nations are experiencing negative population growth. it is the desire for a better life that encourages smaller families.

As for dwindling Chinese and Indian families, on the other hand, Malay families, apart from the rural pre-dominance, are encouraged to have large families given governmental support for healthcare and education, and employment.

But even then, what about immigration ? They are letting in Indonesians and Filipinos by the thousands in certain areas to gain electoral control.

let in enough Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis and Myanmarese and Cambodians and others and maybe chinese then the population also shift what.

What if the non-Malay men in this country were marry Chinese women from CHina or Vietnamese women and if they were brought in to Malaysia, they have to stay here and their children would be Malaysians no ? And if the Chinese men were to have taken 2nd and 3rd and 4th wives in serial polygamy - would that not work against the Grand  UMNO Demographic Plan !!

Now we know what Gnh is up to ? Seed the country with his genes with international participation !

helen brought up a valid point ie the chinese community is dwindling due to smaller families. this is the same with indian families- more and more families have 1 -3 kids only. this is a worldwide trend whereby education makes families to have smaller families except in catholic philipines and south america where religion prohibits family planning. in this catholics and muslims are united as their religions encourages big families. during one population conference the Vatican and Iran were united despite their difference in religion. the problems of overpopulation leading to inadequate food,shelter and other needs of people are not given prominence by the vatican.

so, coming to malaysia, at  this rate, the proportion of chinese and indians in malaysia will come down. so umno dont have to worry about the chinese and indian malaysians. they know that well but are not telling he truth to the malays. I think umno is doing a disservice to malays by keeping them minds in seige preventing the natural talents of malays to blossom. malays are people like anybody else in the world. it is amtter of allowing their natural ablities and talents to flourish.  (frankly, as as socialist i dont suscribe to racial theories. it is the absence of education and other infrastructures that has left some people behind. but i also agree that there is some truth in genetics. this can solved by preventing marriages among close relatives such as cousins.)

the east asian communities ie chinese, koreans, japanese and vietnamese have achieved  tremendous success on par with the west. whats their secret? surely malaysia can duplicate that success here. i wont be surprised if somebody does a study  and reveal the fact that it is lousy politics that keeps many people around the world backward and not race.

Eh Uriah drags me in ?

The women who wants small family, they want keep their Female shape sexy, so
they still desirable ..

See the white ladies, don't want children, their whole countries dying off.
They import cheap labour who turn the tables on them,  look at the Europeans

.... think of summer holidays, no time for children.

PURELY SELFISH REASONS lah URIAH

But so many girls, you give them money, they give you baby.  No big deal.

See those Government servants, the kampong girls desire them so much,
because their pay is automatically credited into wif'es account   -- at
least in the NAVY and ARMY, I am told.

As for good time girls, what they up to, you also know.   But most decent
and normal females also want a good family, with children AND proper husband
around to do the donkey's work.  Who doesn't want to be treated like QUEEN
and KING &gt; ?

Even DONKEYS do !   Ask them .

Write here also not many people as brave as Uriah and Helen Ang, putting
their necks on the chopping block, but guillotine not functioning, so spared
for the time being.

Other's balls already shrunken and atrophied and ran far far away ...

Some don't want to have babies because the future is so BLEAK, global
warming, no food, no house, no hope.    If God so provides, you will, and
should have, about 50 children each.   That is, with the help of at least 6
wives.

Fair enough ?

JUST DO IT !

If I am not mistaken, the point that Helen Ang
is trying to make is that there should be more
democratic space.Gone are those days when the ruling parties
can try and turn the clock back so that people
can exercise their vote without being fully informed.
The coming election will be held with cyber space
wide open, unless the National Front Government
clamps down on telecommunications lines at a
very crucial moment.
We know how the Umno election was stolen in 1987
when the power blacked out at just the right time.
Of course, since desperate situations demand
desperate measures, something may well occur.
Let us pray to God that nothing will occur. GV,
can you please lead the prayer.Stephen Tan

I know of a few chinese men who have divorced now that their children are bigger and older and their wives have moved on to greener pastures. These guys have taken second wives and with the help of viagra and tongkat ali fathered children.
If Chinese and Indian men have the means, they WILL engage in SERIAL Polygamy and you do not need to be MUSLIM to do this  !

leaving genetics aside, chinese and indian women have become aware of their rights . so  serial polygamy is out. even if u take wives from vietnam and china, they will also want smaller families. i dont think state support will encourage bigger families for chinese and indians. in some countries, eg australia- state support is to replace existing population ratio as many western nations are experiencing negative population growth. it is the desire for a better life that encourages smaller families.

Actually it is the cultural mileau intertwined with adaptation and how much of that has to do with genetics, we honestly do not know yet. The brain and our genes interact in such ways we have yet to understand.
Maybe Gnh can enlightnen us huh?
As for dwindling Chinese and Indian families, on the other hand, Malay families, apart from the rural pre-dominance, are encouraged to have large families given governmental support for healthcare and education, and employment.
But even then, what about immigration? They are letting in Indonesians and Filipinos by the thousands in certain areas to gain electoral control.

helen brought up a valid point ie the chinese community is dwindling due to smaller families. this is the same with indian families- more and more families have 1 -3 kids only. this is a worldwide trend whereby education makes families to have smaller families except in catholic philipines and south america where religion prohibits family planning. in this catholics and muslims are united as their religions encourages big families. during one population conference the Vatican and Iran were united despite their difference in religion. the problems of overpopulation leading to inadequate food,shelter and other needs of people are not given prominence by the vatican.
so, coming to malaysia, at  this rate, the proportion of chinese and indians in malaysia will come down. so umno dont have to worry about the chinese and indian malaysians. they know that well but are not telling he truth to the malays. I think umno is doing a disservice to malays by keeping them minds in seige preventing the natural talents of malays to blossom. malays are people like anybody else in the world. it is amtter of allowing their natural ablities and talents to flourish.  (frankly, as as socialist i dont suscribe to racial theories. it is the absence of education and other infrastructures that has left some people behind. but i also agree that there is some truth in genetics. this can solved by preventing marriages among close relatives such as cousins.)
the east asian communities ie chinese, koreans, japanese and vietnamese have achieved  tremendous success on par with the west. whats their secret? surely malaysia can duplicate that success here. i wont be surprised if somebody does a study  and reveal the fact that it is lousy politics that keeps many people around the world backward and not race.

Law and gag order
Helen Ang Aug 2, 07 1:13pm.
Once upon a time, the Congress Party under Indira Gandhi ran an election slogan `India is Indira and Indira is India'. The Congress leader in addition to being a long-serving Prime Minister was the daughter and mother of India's PMs, respectively its first Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi (following her assassination).
Mao Ze Dong also projected himself as China, and political parties which have held the reins of power in perpetuity unchallenged tend to hold to the same formula.
Barisan Nasional brackets itself similarly in the national psyche. But increasingly large numbers of people are rejecting the `BN is Malaysia and Malaysia is BN' sloganeering. The distinction is clear that to be anti-BN is not to be disloyal to king and country.
De facto law minister – Nazri Aziz of Umno (the equation `Umno is BN and BN is Umno' holds true enough though) – last week warned

If I am not mistaken, the point that Helen Ang
is trying to make is that there should be more
democratic space.
Gone are those days when the ruling parties
can try and turn the clock back so that people
can exercise their vote without being fully informed.
The coming election will be held with cyber space
wide open, unless the National Front Government
clamps down on telecommunications lines at a
very crucial moment.
We know how the Umno election was stolen in 1987
when the power blacked out at just the right time.
Of course, since desperate situations demand
desperate measures, something may well occur.
Let us pray to God that nothing will occur. GV,
can you please lead the prayer.
