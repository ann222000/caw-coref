SAN FRANCISCO, California, Jan 8 (IPS) -

http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36095

In a case that could have repercussions for free speech and press freedom in the United States, the U.S. military has subpoenaed two peace activists and a journalist in its case against Lt. Ehren Watada, the first commissioned officer to be court-martialed for refusing to serve in Iraq.

"I'm alarmed," said Olympia-based activist Phan Nguyen, who moderated a Jun. 7th press conference that marked Lt. Watada's first public opposition to the Iraq war.

"When I was first contacted by the lead prosecutor I was questioned as to conversations I had had with Lt. Watada and how this press conference had come about," he said.

Nguyen told IPS that military prosecutors asked who organised the press conference as well as who produced the video statement from Lt. Watada that was played at the gathering.

"This starts leading into how activists go about their procedures in opposing the military," Nguyen said. "I don't believe the military should be questioning activists about how they protest military actions when we're just exercising our first amendment rights."

The military maintains Watada's public comments are at issue, and has charged him with both refusing to deploy and "conduct unbecoming of an officer."

The lieutenant does not dispute any of the statements prosecutors seek to use against him. His attorney says Watada continues to stand by his comments at that June press conference, which his supporters have posted, along with all of his other speeches, on the website thankyoult.org.

"It is my duty as a commissioned officer in the United States army to speak out against grave injustices," Watada said on Jun. 7. "My moral and legal obligation is to the constitution. Not to those who issue unlawful orders. I stand before you today because it is my job to serve and protect American soldiers and innocent Iraqis who have no voice. It is my conclusion that the war in Iraq is not only morally wrong, but also a breach of American law."

At a pre-trial hearing last Thursday, the lead prosecutor, Capt. Daniel Kuecker, said Watada's statements are offensive to the military and must be looked at in the context in which they were made and the effects they could have, as well as the danger they present to the military's mission.

"The dividing line and what makes it more disgraceful is the fact that he made it to more than one person," Kuecker said at the court martial, according to the Army Times.

Military prosecutors also point to comments Watada made at the Veterans for Peace annual convention in Seattle last August.

In a "charge sheet" against the lieutenant, the military quotes Watada's comments at the gathering, calling them "disgraceful."

"Today, I speak with you about a radical idea," Watada told the gathering. "That to stop an illegal and unjust war, soldiers can choose to stop fighting it... If soldiers realised this war is contrary to what the constitution extols -- if they stood up and threw their weapons down -- no president could ever initiate a war of choice again. When we say, '...Against all enemies foreign and domestic', what if elected leaders became the enemy? Whose orders do we follow? The answer is the conscience that lies in each soldier, each American, and each human being. Our duty to the constitution is an obligation, not a choice."

The military has also subpoenaed Seattle-area activist and doctor Gerri Haynes, who chaired the Veterans for Peace convention, and a free-lance journalist who interviewed Watada, Sarah Olson. Another journalist, Dahr Jamail, who transcribed the videotape footage of Watada's speech, has been placed on the prosecution witness list.

In an editorial Monday titled "Military Injustice", the Los Angeles Times strongly criticised the Pentagon's "pestering" of reporters in its prosecution -- which the paper argues is justified on the grounds that Watada refused to deploy to Iraq.

"It's egregious enough when U.S. attorneys subpoena journalists, which is happening at an alarmingly increasing rate (illustrating the need for a national shield law). But there is something especially chilling about the U.S. military reaching beyond its traditional authority to compel a non-military U.S. citizen engaged in news-gathering to testify in a military court, simply to bolster a court-martial case. There is no security interest at stake, and no matter of national urgency," the paper said.

Unlike fellow activist Phan Nguyen, Dr. Haynes said she has no problem appearing at the lieutenant's court martial, which is scheduled for Feb. 5.

"I have been very clear about my support for Ehren Watada," she told IPS. "His speech is on tape and all over the internet. I'm not sure that my testimony is of great relevance, but I'll do anything I can to help support Ehren."

Gary Solis, a former military prosecutor who teaches at Georgetown's School of Law, told IPS he's surprised the military has decided to call peace activists to testify against Lt. Watada.

"I really don't know what they may be driving at," he said. "As a prosecutor, I would be very cautious about calling people who I knew would be unfriendly. There's a certain risk that's being run here."

The tactic could blow up in the prosecutors' faces if the activists are able to make an articulate case for Watada and against the war, Solis said, adding the military may find it difficult to compel civilians who resist a subpoena to appear in court.

"The UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) has no application to civilians so the military has no hammer with the UCMJ alone," he said. "They would have to find a civilian court federal hammer, which would involve getting a second subpoena from a district court."

The precise nature of the charges against Watada remains at issue. At the pre-trial hearing last week, military prosecutors sought to block Watada's attorneys from making a legal case against the Iraq war as part of his defence.

During the hearing, the military judge overseeing the case, Lt. Col. John Head, suggested that such arguments would go to Watada's motive for not deploying and therefore would not be admissible. However, he later said the Army had opened the door by charging the soldier for comments made during the June news conference moderated by Phan Nguyen. (END/2007)

Bush will send OTHER PEOPLE to fight anywhere but where America's
enemies are; the recent bombing in Somalia is an example. The
"terrorist" killed went from being a radical sympathizer of extremist
islam to BEING part of al Qaeda. The sectarian civil war in Iraq proves
Islam has more than one face; Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, and
Bush has let them INTO the secular nation of Iraq. Nobody who pays
attention bought the Somalia photo op. If Bush wants to see al Qaeda
financiers and followers, he need look no further than his home in
Kennebunkport or his ranchette in Texas whenever his heroes Bandar &
Abdullah grace him with their presence. AL QAEDA IS ALIVE & THRIVING

Exactly!!  AlQaeda foments conflict among small elements - then finances them
as they grow into larger threats.  Like the terrorists in Nigeria now - blowing up oil infrastructures and kidnapping workers - because the people are poor and the oil profits haven't gone to them - but to the corrupt government and U.S. oil companies.

Well, Slick, you say you're a vet and I'll even grant that you may be one,
but if you are, then apparently you chose to take the same kind of path that
John Fonda Kerry did and turn your back on your brothers.  You delight in calling
me a pretender and I say that's cool, because what YOU believe is irrelevant.
I did NOT turn my backs on my brothers in those days and in today's war I
WILL NOT turn my back on my present day brothers and sisters.  My brothers and
sisters, from th eold days AND from the new are those whose opinion matters to
me, not yours.

When I retire from a career that spanned 40 years of my life ( No, dipshit I
have no problem with math, I had a break in service, chump) with 25 years of
active duty and  and 3 years in the USAR, I'll do so with pride in my service
and thankfullness that I've been allowed to serve with the finest people in the
world, starting in 1967 and ending this August or September. In my retirement
I will again NOT turn my back on my brothers and sisters as I begin a career
as an advocate for them.  Like the swiftees, one of the elements of my
advocacy will be to counteract the loathesome hatred, bitterness, and subversive
actions of "veterans" who, parade their service as if it were a magic charm
protecting them from any criticism at all while they malign and harm our soldiers
and future veterans of the present day through their demoralization campaigns
which benefit only our enemies.

BTW, the quote yesterday was from the Army regulation dealing with "Sabotage
and Espionage Directed Against the Department of the Army", the further
reference was to the punitive United States Code.  The US Code addresses the fact
that those of your friends who were subpoened MIGHT be liable to punishment for
subversion under that US Code.  Many of your writings might also be considered
under that code which far exceeds the bounds of "free speach".  You ought to
consider that when you write or copy things that might be considered under 18
USC, even though it's been quite a while since the US has prosecuted anyone
for subversion. That's not a warning, because I don't make threats, but it is a
suggestion that you consider what you're doing. For myself, I'm sure that once
I retire that you, as an apparent activist and I will debate in real life ,
on opposite sides of the issues concerned with members opf the military.  Until
that time, I'd rather not indulge in blind and meaningless debate on a thread
such as this with one such as you.

Me and Other Vets, you keep trying to describe our lives on your terms
knowing absolutely nothing about us or what we did!

Fear is not a Quality little one, but in can come in handy!!

Well, Slick, you say you're a vet and I'll even grant that you may be one, but if you are, then apparently you chose to take the same kind of path that John Fonda Kerry did and turn your back on your brothers.  You delight in calling me a pretender and I say that's cool, because what YOU believe is irrelevant.  I did NOT turn my backs on my brothers in those days and in today's war I WILL NOT turn my back on my present day brothers and sisters.  My brothers and sisters, from th eold days AND from the new are those whose opinion matters to me, not yours.

When I retire from a career that spanned 40 years of my life ( No, dipshit I have no problem with math, I had a break in service, chump) with 25 years of active duty and  and 3 years in the USAR, I'll do so with pride in my service and thankfullness that I've been allowed to serve with the finest people in the world, starting in 1967 and ending this August or September. In my retirement I will again NOT turn my back on my brothers and sisters as I begin a career as an advocate for them.  Like the swiftees, one of the elements of my advocacy will be to counteract the loathesome hatred, bitterness, and subversive actions of "veterans" who, parade their service as if it were a magic charm protecting them from any criticism at all while they malign and harm our soldiers and future veterans of the present day through their demoralization campaigns which benefit only our enemies.

BTW, the quote yesterday was from the Army regulation dealing with "Sabotage and Espionage Directed Against the Department of the Army", the further reference was to the punitive United States Code.  The US Code addresses the fact that those of your friends who were subpoened MIGHT be liable to punishment for subversion under that US Code.  Many of your writings might also be considered under that code which far exceeds the bounds of "free speach".  You ought to consider that when you write or copy things that might be considered under 18 USC, even though it's been quite a while since the US has prosecuted anyone for subversion. That's not a warning, because I don't make threats, but it is a suggestion that you consider what you're doing. For myself, I'm sure that once I retire that you, as an apparent activist and I will debate in real life , on opposite sides of the issues concerned with members opf the military.  Until that time, I'd rather not indulge in blind and
meaningless debate on a thread such as this with one such as you.

With Bush eager to complete the PNAC of invading Iraq, then Lebanon (accomplished for us by Israel last summer), Syria and Iran - written by Neocons in rightwing stink tanks in the 90s - and issued again 10 days after 911 - and with Bush invading the Iranian consulate in Iraq today - let's hope we get a Democratic president in 2008 to INCREASE our military.
Cause folks are just toooo smart to enlist under a Repub prez.

Lets take this one first Ace, according to one of your posts you're
looking at 'Stop Loss', needn't say more on that, except it doesn't
cover that lenght of service!!

Next time you READ a posting bring something that makes Sense as to the
Posting, that didn't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And Speaking Of Turning Backs On Brothers, and I Might Add Sisters, the
postings you rtwo Shitheads Ignore READ VOLUMES on the Support you're
Giving or are Willing to give!! Even current Military Personal realize
just where you and like minded Stand!! What you think they can't tell
the differance, their much more Intelligent than either of you two and
the 'chimp' you're backing, not to mention the type of government
you're looking for, and it Certainly Isn't Defined As Democratic!!!!
The personal we work with have No Problems with understanding what
we're doing, and by 'Spitting' once again on another Vet, i.e. Kerry,
while Backing an AWOL Slacker, they read that loud and clear!!

But your Fear of us should baffle, it doesn't, it just shows What and

Of course it does, idiot.  It's based on unit and on when you're scheduled to
deploy per ARForgen.  As it presently stands, it's one year prior to
schdeuled deployment.  You truly are a dispshit aren't you?

Your article about Watada or whatever his name is indicated that the two
"activists" couldn't be called to testify under the UCMJ,  First off, that's
incorrect.  Second, it's definitely a possibility that they could be called under
18 USC for their own trials for subversion as defined in the RA I sent.

You and those you now say you work with might well be guilty of subversion as
defined by the AR and therefore subject to the punitive trial and snactions
under Title 18, for your continued publishing of articles fostering and
abetting a diminishment of discipline, a disobedience toone's duty, desertion etc.
That's subversion and if you think that being a subvesrsive makes you someone
who's looking out for the troops, then you're a very sick and simple simon.
Subversive activities are the worst kind of "spitting" in a vets face or an
active soldier's face of which  I can think.

Fear, of you?  Disgust yes, anger at what you do or are tring to do to my
people (My soldiers and for the Counselor who objected once before about them
being "our" soldiers not mine, yes, they are mine, to care about, to take care
of, to defend against those who would try to subvert them, to know them, to keep
them as safe as humanly possible while accomplishing their mission(s),
they're mine it's an unwritten part of my contract, AKA oath of office) fear, fraid
not.

BS and Pred are probably all wrapped up in duct tape and plastic sheeting!   left over from the fearmongering scam that led us into Iraq.  No wonder Repubs refused to allow hearings on Bush's prewar intel.  Lots of folks would really be MAD to
know they bought duct tape and plastic sheeting - for NOTHING!   except to raise the profits of Home Depot and the Republicans' corporateers.

During the 90s - after 1994 - Dems proposed increasing the military - but the Repubs rejected it.  Just read an article on that this week.
btw - in 2004 - while Bush had Bushies thinking "victory" was just around the corner in Iraq, Kerry and Dems were calling for MORE troops.
Bet you don't remember that either.

This is Too Easy 'pretender':
I'll use your initials BS as in BS

BS

BS

And A Royal BS
You, Support the Troops, Where, When and How!!!
You haven't posted a Damn Thing about the Troops except as in Support
of the AWOL Dipstick, and you Pass Right Over Everything About The
Active Military and Veterans except to Verbally Spit on certain
Veterans, myself included, and Any 'GoldStar' Family Member who Scares
Your empty heart and mind, You're a Totally Phony Patriot!!

And as for your service, get your own stroy line Straight, it doesn't
jive this time with what you've posted before, and it probably doesn't
with even before that! I'd suggest you Write It Down, Keep Copy by the
puter, and Regurgitate when needed!!!

And Yes you are Threatened by someone like me, otherwise you wouldn't
keep trying to 'Swiftboat' and Attempt to Describe my life, which you
know Nothing About!!
One more thing, it's been always known that whatever Fonda or even
Kerry, who was just a Spokesperson for the Winter Soldiers on their
admitted Atrosities in 'Nam, No Matter What Was Said Had NO Effect on
the treatment of POWS in North Vietnam nor the War!!
What did, as McCain knows and the other POWS also, were that their
fellow pilots were Bombing the North at the time of their Captivity and
those Bombs were killing Innocent North Vietnamesse on their Own
Countries Soil!!!!

Veterans Do NOT Condone Torture!
The Failed Policies will Haunt Us and the World for Decades!

Ok Asshole, tell me what exactly doesn't "jive"?  The rest of what you wrote
is worthless but I'm curious about what your demented anti American mind
thinks doesn't "jibe".
