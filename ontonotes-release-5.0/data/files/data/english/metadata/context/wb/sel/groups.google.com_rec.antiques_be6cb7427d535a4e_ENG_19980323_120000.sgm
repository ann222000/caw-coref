Besides Replacements, Ltd., is there a place that specializes in
discontinued flatware? We need some knives for home use in the
Pilgrim pattern done by William Fraser (Cromargen Germany).

This is just for everyday use, and I know this is &quot;rec.antiques&quot;, but
I don't know where else to inquire about discontinued flatware. ANy
help would be appreciated.

Regards,

Tom Kustner

Southeren Living magazine usually has a list in the back of their want ad
section of companies advertising for this type of service. Replacemnts
Limited got their start there as well.
