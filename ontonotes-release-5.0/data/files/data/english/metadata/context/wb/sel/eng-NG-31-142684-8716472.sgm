I believe this is originally from &quot;Land and Liberty,&quot; the UK Georgist
publication, and appeared over 50 years ago.  The exact same
inexorable economic logic applies not just in India in 1946, but here
and now, and in every other country where idle landowning is the
principal route to great wealth, privilege and luxury.

HOW AID GOES WRONG -- A Cautionary Tale

A Quaker Enterprise in the Ganges Delta

The much-travelled author Karl Eskelund describes the effort
made by a band of young American and English Quakers in
trying to assist some of the Indian population, millions of
whom live at starvation level.

The young idealists took up their task in 1946 at the
village district of Pifa, which lies in the Ganges Delta.
They were fully aware that their work would test their
patience, for in India you can get no results 'at five
minutes past twelve.' But after having outlined their plans
to the peasants, the fishermen and the landowners - which
met with general approval - they organised a co-operative
enterprise for cultivating the land and marketing the
produce. They set up day schools for the children, evening
schools for adults, clinics, et cetera.

After overcoming the initial difficulties, they saw signs of
progress. Inspiration grew. Health conditions improved.
Everyone took a greater interest in their work and their
earnings increased. New ideas took shape - there was advance
along the whole line - an advance, slow but sure.

Only the Landowners Grew Fatter

Five years after the experiment began, Karl Eskelund visited
Pifa and, with one of the Quakers as his guide, went through
the village to see how it was faring.

The Quaker had lost more than two stone (28 lbs) and was as
thin and spare as the natives. But what was worse, he had lost
heart because the experiment had proved a failure.

The day school still existed, but only one-quarter of the
children attended it. The evening school had closed. The
clinic was hardly used. Agriculture, fishing and trade were
back to the old methods. Eskelund asked for an explanation
of this fiasco.

The young Quaker offered quite a number of reasons, none of
which Eskelund could accept. Finally, he got to the root of
the matter. This is what he says: &quot;In the first year after
beginning the experiment, both peasants and fishermen earned
more than ever before. What was the result? The large
landowners at once raised their rents and the smaller
landowners followed suit. The peasants had to pay more for
permission to cultivate the land. The fishermen had to pay
more for permission to cast their nets on the flooded
fields. In that way, practically the whole of the increased
earnings passed into the landowners' pockets.&quot;

&quot;The people of Pifa were unhappy at this. Nevertheless, next
year they worked hard. Crops were plentiful, there was a
rich catch of fish; good prices were paid for produce. At
once, the landowners raised their rents still higher.&quot;

&quot;The people then began to lose heart. What was the use if,
for all their efforts, they got no benefit? Only the landowners
waxed fatter. The peasants and fishermen did not become
any thinner: they could not, otherwise they would die.&quot;

&quot;Indians are ignorant, but they are not stupid. They can put
two and two together. They had found themselves momentarily
enriched by the new methods but, in the end, all the extra
money went to the landowners. If one of the new ideas would
not work, what faith could they put in any other novelties?
Perhaps, after all, the old methods were the best.&quot;

This is the story as far as it goes. It would be difficult
to find an example that more simply and clearly demonstrates
the truth of what Henry George taught. It is that, as
long as the private right to the rent of land obtains, so
long will every advance, crystallizing in land rent, be
gathered by the owner of land; while he who works, he who
produces, must toil the day long without gaining more for
his labour than is enough to avoid death from hunger.

This story reveals the problem in all its simplicity;
cleared of all that in civilized society makes it more
difficult to see the importance of land.

The Need to Remould the Whole System

The young Quaker would not lay any blame on the landowners.
There could be no objection against the landowners trying to
gain as much as possible, and after all, there was nothing
unlawful in owning land. The young Quaker admitted the
immorality of the circumstances, but argued that it could be
mended only by &quot;remaking the law and remoulding the whole
system.&quot;

Eskelund himself sees clearly the part the land question
plays, and proposed the subdivision of land (by creating
small-holdings). Yet he is not sure that subdivision will
solve the problem. For he writes:

&quot;Meanwhile, there is evidence that you don't get rid of
landownership in that manner. Landownership is like the weed
that always re-sprouts.&quot;

&quot;The Indian peasant has a habit of using every penny he
possesses to spend on festive occasions; when a son is born
or when a daughter is married. If he has no cash he goes to
the moneylender, who is often the landowner, the only person
in the village who has ready money. Of course that is stupid
of the peasant, but he has so little in hand. Already there
have been occasions where a man who had become owner
of his plot got into debt and had to forfeit his land. Thus he
became a day labourer again, to toil for the same landlord
as before.&quot;

September 28, 2007

Bill Moyers talks with John Bogle.

BILL MOYERS: Welcome to the JOURNAL.
Every week we hear of another publicly traded company being bought by
a private equity firm. Some of those investment firms - like
Blackstone, the Carlyle Group, and Cerebrus - have become almost as
well known as the brand-name companies they've been snapping up, from
Chrysler to Dunkin' Donuts to Toys R Us. But private equity firms have
no real interest in toys, cars, or baked goods. What they are after is
big and quick returns on their capital. To get it, they buy a company
and cut the wages, pensions and health benefits of the employees who
work there.

Take a look at this front page story in Sunday's NEW YORK TIMES for a
glimpse of how this kind of capitalism works. Thousands of nursing
homes have been bought up by private equity firms like Warburg Pincus
and Carlyle. Profits were increased by reducing costs, then investors
quickly resold the facilities for a big profit Ð leaving and I quote-
&quot;residents at those nursing homes worse off, on average, than they
were under previous owners.&quot;

Exhibit #1: Habana Health Care Center in Tampa, Florida, purchased by
a group of private equity firms in 2002. &quot;Within months, the number of
clinical registered nurses at the home was half of what it had been a
year earlier...budgets for nursing supplies, resident activities and
other services also fell...&quot; &quot;When regulators visited, they found
malfunctioning fire doors, unhygienic kitchens, and a resident using a
leg brace that was broken...&quot;

Basing its report on state government data, the TIMES says 15 at
Habana died from what their families contend was negligent care. But
when families sue, they often can't find out even who owns the nursing
homes because of the complex corporate structures private equity firms
have created to cover their tracks.

It's this kind of capitalism that drives John Bogle up the wall, as
you're about to learn. John Bogle believes owners should be in charge
- and accountable. He's known and respected world-wide as the father
of index funds and the founder of The Vanguard Group, one of the
largest mutual funds anywhere, with over a trillion dollars in assets.

FORTUNE magazine named him one of the four giants of the 20th century
in the investment industry. TIME magazine called him one of the
world's 100 most powerful and influential people. Among his six books
is this one THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF CAPITALISM and more recently
THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING. In the current issue of
DAEDALUS, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he
has a blockbuster of an essay on democracy in corporate America.
You'll find it on our Web site at pbs.org. I talked with John Bogle
when he was in town earlier this week.

BILL MOYERS: Thanks for joining me.

JOHN BOGLE: My pleasure.

BILL MOYERS: This story in THE NEW YORK TIMES this week. What do you
think when you read a story like that?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, first, it's a national disgrace. Simply put. And
there are some things that must be entrusted to government and some
things that must be entrusted to private enterprise. And what we see
there, at least in my judgment, is that we've taken medical care,
healthcare and going from making it a profession in which the patient
is the object of the game - preserving the patient &quot;first do no harm&quot;
as Hippocrates would say or would have said and turn that into a
business. And so, it's a bottom line. I've often said we're in a
bottom line society. We're measuring the wrong bottom line.

BILL MOYERS: What does it say to you that the real owners of the
nursing home, the private investors have created this maze of smoke
and mirrors that make it virtually impossible to find out who the
owners really are?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, that's so typical of much that's going on in
American finance, the way we structure these financial instruments,
which are stock certificates or debt instruments. But it's the same
thing of the removal of your friendly, local neighborhood bank holding
the mortgage and being able to work with you when you fall on hard
times to some unnamed, often unknown, financial institution who
couldn't care less.

BILL MOYERS: These private equity firms that own these nursing homes
wouldn't even talk to THE NEW YORK TIMES. They won't talk to
reporters. I mean, there's no accountability to the public.

JOHN BOGLE: There's no accountability. And it's wrong. It's
fundamentally a blight on our society.

BILL MOYERS: What does it say that big private money can operate so
secretly, with so little accountability, that the people who are hurt
by it, the residents in the nursing home have no recourse?

JOHN BOGLE: It says something very bad about American society. And you
wonder - the first question anybody would have after reading the
article - how in God's name do they get away with that? Well, we have
all these attorneys that are capable of devising complex instruments,
and money managers who are capable of devising highly complex
financial schemes. And there's kind of no one to answer to the call of
duty at the end of it.

BILL MOYERS: And we're talking about some of the most powerful names
in the business. I mean, these are formidable forces, right?

JOHN BOGLE: They're formidable forces. But, I'm afraid--

BILL MOYERS: Respectable citizens, right?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, I mean, I don't know about that. But, it's certainly
-- it's easy to say that greed is taking - playing a part - greed has
a role in a capitalistic society. But, not the dominant role and--

BILL MOYERS: What should be the dominant? What is the job of
capitalism?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, ultimately, the job of capitalism is to serve the
consumer. Serve the citizenry. You're allowed to make a profit for
that. But, you've got to provide good products and services at fair
prices. And that's the long term, that's what businesses do in the
long term. The businesses that have endured in America have done that
and done that successfully.

But, in the short term, there's all these financial machinations in
which people can get very rich in a very short period of time by
creating highly complex financial instruments, providing services that
can be cut back easily as in the hospital article, not measuring up to
basically their duty.

We all know that in professions, the idea has been service to the
client before service to self. That's what a profession is. That's
what medicine was. That's what accountancy was. That's what attorneys
used to be. That's what trusteeship used to be inside the mutual fund
industry. But, we've moved from that to a big capital accumulation -
self interest - creating wealth for the providers of these services
when the providers of these services are in fact subtracting value
from society. So, it doesn't work.

BILL MOYERS: So, the private equity nursing homes have added to their
wealth. But, they've subtracted from society the care for people who
need it.

JOHN BOGLE: That is exactly correct. Not good.

BILL MOYERS: THE WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial page celebrates what it
called the animal spirits of business. And as if that's the heart of
capitalism. What do you think about that?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, I like the animal spirits of business. I mean Lord
Keynes told us about animal spirits. And it comes out of a part of his
work that says, &quot;You know, all the precise numbers and the
perspectives mean nothing. What determines the future of a business is
its animal spirits.&quot; You know, the desire for progress, the desire to
create something new. That's all good. But, it's gotten misshapen.
Badly--

BILL MOYERS: How so?

JOHN BOGLE: --misshapen.

BILL MOYERS: How so?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, it's gotten misshapen because the financial side of
the economy is dominating the productive side of the economy

BILL MOYERS: What do you mean?

JOHN BOGLE: Well, let me say it very simply. The rewards of the growth
in our economy comes from corporate, largely - from corporations who
are a very important measure, from corporations that are providing
goods and services at a fair price innovating and bringing in new
technology - providing a higher quality of life for our society and
they make money doing it. I mean, and the returns in business in the
long run are 100 percent the dividends a corporation pays and the rate
at which its earnings grow.

That still exists. But, it's been overwhelmed by a financial economy.
The financial economy, which is the way you package all these ways of
financing corporations, more and more complex, more and more
expensive. The financial sector of our economy is the largest profit-
making sector in America. Our financial services companies make more
money than our energy companies - no mean profitable business in this
day and age. Plus, our healthcare companies. They make almost twice as
much as our technology companies, twice as much as our manufacturing
companies. We've become a financial economy which has overwhelmed the
productive economy to the detriment of investors and the detriment
ultimately of our society.

BILL MOYERS: By the financial sector, you mean?

JOHN BOGLE: Banks, money managers, insurance companies, certainly
annuity providers. They're all subtracting value from the economy.
They have to subtract. To be clear on this now - I don't want to
overstate it. To be clear on this, they have to subtract some value.
But, the question is--

BILL MOYERS: What do you mean they subtract some value?

JOHN BOGLE: In other words, - you've go to pay somebody something to
provide a service. It's just gotten totally out of hand. My estimate
is that the financial sector takes $560 billion a year out of society.
Five hundred and sixty billion.

BILL MOYERS: Where does it go?

JOHN BOGLE: It goes into the pockets of hedge fund managers, mutual
fund managers, bankers, insurance

More angry rent-seekers and idle threats (heaven forbid a region's natural
resources are used to enrich and benefit its own citizens):

http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHR2P1I3KKWIA8KjuQ8q4Op...

EnCana says it will cut Alberta investment by $1B if province hikes royalties

8 hours ago

CALGARY - Energy giant EnCana Corp. (TSX:ECA) has served notice that it will cut
its capital investment in Alberta by $1 billion next year if the province
increases oil and gas royalties as much as proposed by a government panel.

&quot;If adopted in full, the royalty changes will negatively impact EnCana's future
investments and operations in Alberta and will have a widespread impact on
economic activity across the province,&quot; the company said Friday in response to
last week's report from the Alberta royalty review panel.

EnCana, North America's largest natural gas producer and a growing oilsands
operator, said it had been planning to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on
Alberta-based drilling and development in 2008.

The Calgary-based company said it will &quot;reallocate capital to investments
outside Alberta&quot; if the government adopts the panel's so-called &quot;fair share&quot;
proposal for a 20 per cent increase in the province's overall resource revenue take.

&quot;Many of Alberta's new and emerging resource plays will simply not be
economically viable,&quot; said EnCana CEO Randy Eresman.

&quot;These new plays would have formed the foundation for the future of Alberta's
natural gas production.&quot;

Warning that this would cause a continuing production decline, Eresman added:
&quot;We are open to changes to Alberta's royalties - changes that reflect the
economic realities of volatile commodity prices, higher costs and the
appropriate risks and rewards of long-term capital investments.&quot;

But the proposed changes &quot;will have immediate and long-term impacts on working
Albertans,&quot; EnCana cautioned, saying the investment cutback would ripple through
the whole provincial economy.

&quot;We would greatly regret seeing these job opportunities evaporate.&quot;

The head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said this is the
time of year that companies have to make spending decisions.

&quot;Every company in town is working through those royalty reviews. They're in the
middle of capital budgets which happen this time of the year and go to the
boards in October,&quot; said CAPP president Pierre Alvarez.

&quot;So you've got to understand what the implications of a decision might be so
EnCana's the first and clearly the most public but I know everyone is looking at
what the implications would be to that company, if the implementation goes
ahead,&quot; he added.

Kyle Preston, an oil and gas analyst with Salman Partners, observed that EnCana
made a significant cut to its drilling program in the past year and he wouldn't
have been surprised if another reduction was coming anyway in 2008, considering
current low natural gas prices.

&quot;Even with that new royalty regime, they would be economic at a certain price,&quot;
Preston said.

&quot;So it's not just the royalties that are causing them to cut their budget - it's
a combination of the royalties and the low gas prices.&quot;

More than 80 per cent of EnCana's output is natural gas, but the company has
also struck a heavy oil deal with U.S. giant ConocoPhillips to expand its
northern Alberta oilsands operations.

In late 2006, EnCana announced it would cut overall spending by six per cent to
US5.9 billion in 2007, reflecting a plan to temper growth in its natural gas and
oil production because of weaker gas prices and inflationary pressures that had
raised operating costs in the industry.

However, EnCana spokesman Alan Boras said low natural gas prices were not a
factor in Friday's statement, as EnCana has hedged half of its production for
the year at about US$8.50 per thousand cubic feet, well above current prices.

And Boras balked at a characterization of Encana's statement as a threat.

&quot;We had an obligation to inform our employees and our contractors and suppliers
that the results of the royalty panel's recommendations could have a dramatic
impact on what our investment levels look like as we go forward,&quot; he said.

&quot;We are not opposed to royalty changes,&quot; Boras added. &quot;We understand they happen
from time to time but we just want to encourage a broad debate and understanding
of what the potential impacts are.&quot;

Earlier this week energy research company Wood Mackenzie said Alberta would
reduce the value of oilsands projects by US$26 billion if it adopted the
recommendations to boost taxes and royalties.

The controversial report by the royalty review panel said Albertans have been
shortchanged by the oilpatch for years.

It said oilsands projects should pay roughly 36 per cent, though with a
continuing royalty holiday for new projects to encourage the multibillion-dollar
commitments involved in the northern Alberta oilsands.

High-production oil and natural gas wells should also pay higher royalties, the
panel said, although a large number of low-production wells would pay less.

In trading Friday on the TSX, EnCana shares rose 31 cents to $61.64.

Here we get to the root of the problem not rising rents but a lack of a

own land? Because there is no way to get credit. Customs prevent people
who have money from engaging in money lending. The banking system is
weak and there is no way to gauge if the lendee will pay back. The
result has often been going to an employer to get funds because the

Roy forgets conveniently the richest country in the world has private
land owners. The difference is we also have a banking system in which
allows people to borrow money to buy land and capital. India does not
have this. There is a whole slew of literature about problems with
banking systems in rural India being the root of poverty. Roy would do
good to read some of Basu's work. He is an Indian who is a development
economist that has done a lot of work on this.

The problem is not land ownership it is lank of a solid banking system.
Banking system are what lets their be a middle class. Without there
would be few land and home owners in the US and we would almost rent. A
good banking system allows me to borrow against the value of the land I
will obtain and future wages. This allows to buy land without having to
save up wages for years. India has no such thing in the rural areas.
That is the difference. In both countries private land ownership exist.
In the US it is the land is allocated to more people because banks
provide the financial capital for people to buy from land owners.

Because in rural India land owners are people who have money and often
of a caste where money lending is not a social stigma, Roy confuses the
problem of a lack of a good banking system with a problem of land ownership.

If India reforms its banking system and these people could obtain loans
like Americans could there would be a lot more people owning land. An
oligopoly on land exist precisely because people can not borrow the
money to buy the property from the oligopolists. The problem is not land
ownership or denying access without rent. It is a poor banking system
that can not allow people to borrow against the land value they wish to
buy.

To sum up your argument:

A private title system with lots of mortgage money to lend at long term
amortization would be a boon to poor farmers because it would allow them to obtain
their own land instead of renting land from landlords.  In this scenario mortgage
lenders are benefactors of mankind.

The landless worker movements in India, Brazil, Bolivia and other places reject the
tender mercies of the bankers and instead prefer a more direct solution to the
landless problem.  They demand the land free and clear without paying a dime for
it.  They assert that land is their birthright.  They don't want to exchange paying
rent to landlord for paying rent to a banker.

Land is in fact being restored without charge to peasants in many places around the
world.

Land value taxation accomplishes the same thing as direct land grants to peasants.
LVT destroys selling price of land.  When government collects all the land rent
via LVT there is none left to be capitalized into selling price.  When the
collected rent is used to benefit the entire community, land is in effect made free
to use.  Only individuals who hold land worth more than average value pay any net
rent.  Conversely, those individuals who hold land worth less than average receive
greater than per capita benefits.

That's pure bullying. Alberta should just tell EnCan to go and fuck itself.
There are plenty of others wishing to step in for a lot less. Just ask Russians.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the moneylender, who is often the landowner, the only person
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the village who has ready money.

&gt;&gt; Here we get to the root of the problem not rising rents but a lack of
&gt;&gt; a banking system in rural India that exist today. Why can the workers
&gt;&gt; not own land? Because there is no way to get credit. Customs prevent
&gt;&gt; people who have money from engaging in money lending. The banking
&gt;&gt; system is weak and there is no way to gauge if the lendee will pay
&gt;&gt; back. The result has often been going to an employer to get funds
&gt;&gt; because the employer can guarantee payment.

&gt;&gt; Roy forgets conveniently the richest country in the world has private
&gt;&gt; land owners. The difference is we also have a banking system in which
&gt;&gt; allows people to borrow money to buy land and capital. India does not
&gt;&gt; have this. There is a whole slew of literature about problems with
&gt;&gt; banking systems in rural India being the root of poverty. Roy would do
&gt;&gt; good to read some of Basu's work. He is an Indian who is a development
&gt;&gt; economist that has done a lot of work on this.

&gt;&gt; The problem is not land ownership it is lank of a solid banking
&gt;&gt; system. Banking system are what lets their be a middle class. Without
&gt;&gt; there would be few land and home owners in the US and we would almost
&gt;&gt; rent. A good banking system allows me to borrow against the value of
&gt;&gt; the land I will obtain and future wages. This allows to buy land
&gt;&gt; without having to save up wages for years. India has no such thing in
&gt;&gt; the rural areas. That is the difference. In both countries private
&gt;&gt; land ownership exist. In the US it is the land is allocated to more
&gt;&gt; people because banks provide the financial capital for people to buy
&gt;&gt; from land owners.

&gt;&gt; Because in rural India land owners are people who have money and often
&gt;&gt; of a caste where money lending is not a social stigma, Roy confuses
&gt;&gt; the problem of a lack of a good banking system with a problem of land
&gt;&gt; ownership.

&gt;&gt; If India reforms its banking system and these people could obtain
&gt;&gt; loans like Americans could there would be a lot more people owning
&gt;&gt; land. An oligopoly on land exist precisely because people can not
&gt;&gt; borrow the money to buy the property from the oligopolists. The
&gt;&gt; problem is not land ownership or denying access without rent. It is a
&gt;&gt; poor banking system that can not allow people to borrow against the
&gt;&gt; land value they wish to buy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Already there
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been occasions where a man who had become owner
&gt;&gt;&gt; of his plot got into debt and had to forfeit his land.

&gt;&gt; Roy does not realize this sentence disproves that land owners are
&gt;&gt; thieving bastards living off of rent. If so the land would not be lost
&gt;&gt; to debt. The abnormal profits would be enough for the person who
&gt;&gt; obtains the land to avoid debt.

&gt;&gt; If Roy had read Basu or other development economist he would
&gt;&gt; understand about permanent indebtedness of the peasant classes and how
&gt;&gt; the lack of a banking system is the underlying problem in rural India.

&gt; To sum up your argument:

&gt; A private title system with lots of mortgage money to lend at long term
&gt; amortization would be a boon to poor farmers because it would allow them
&gt; to obtain their own land instead of renting land from landlords.  In
&gt; this scenario mortgage lenders are benefactors of mankind.

They allow people to borrow against future profits and wages so they
have the ability to obtain land and capital.

It is the only solution available because the banks are not there. They
don't have the laws where banks can easily secure payments they don't

lending. It is not a choice the banks are simply not there.

With a good banking system you need no grants. The quotation Roy posted
shows that owners are willing to sell the land. The missing ingredient
is those who can use it well being able to raise financial capital. With
a good banking system this is easy because the value of the land secures
the loan and credit scoring and laws about being able to sue for
repayment reduce risk. There need be no government redistribution just a
good banking system that can handle risk well enough to put the
financial capital in the hands of those who can best use the land. \

The banking is more likely to come to an efficient outcome. Those who
can use the land best will be most likely to seek loans. Those who do
not use the land well will be allocated land under redistribution. Only
those who can turn a profit on the land and fully extract rent will buy
the land if the banking system allows them too. The banking system
outcome is more likely to be efficient.

In rural India redistribution is likely to see those who do not use the
land well go into debt to the original land owner and lose reverting the
situation. If a loan goes to someone who can not use the land well then
the bank sells as it makes another loan to someone who can use the land.

Sure people with no land would prefer it just be given to them. This is
not the social optimum though.

Then again maybe not. Interesting enough the latest Rasmussen poll said
only 44% of Americans would want free health care. This is quite
interesting in that only 44% said they would take it. 39% said they
would not want it and 17% said they didn't know. Ask who wants free
bread and all would take it. Why is this? Well because 56% of Americans
realize it is not free.

I am not sure all potential landowners would want redistribution as
opposed to a market solution. Potential landowners realize they own the
land and have few resources for improvement because they are still poor.
Without a good lending system the land is likely to be lost to a lender
charging pawn shop rates. With a good banking system they have to give
up a portion of future rent to get the land now but have access to
capital markets. Therefore they might realize if they are good farmers
and know what they are doing the banking system is better because with
profitability they can get more loans and more land. With redistribution
they are such with the plot they are given and have few resources to
expand with.

Very similarly many Americans realize in the UK &quot;free&quot; health care cost
a 17.5% VAT that is a sales tax on every thing bought and up to 40%
income taxes on top of that. That is not very free. Healthcare may be
important but many Americans including me don't won't to pay that much
for it. Many like I would rather see private insurance instead of
government replacements and HSAs with catastrophic insurance in case a
big disease hits.

The situation is similar the astute potential land owner would prefer
good banking with access to capital markets rather than redistribution.
Even if the land were taxed it would not redistribute the current owners
are the only one's with the means to buy the land. It would not sell and
if it did it would not be to the workers of the land just a different
land owner. If the supply of rental land is not perfectly inelastic it
could also result in higher rent payment from the tenants (not economic
rent).

The banking system is the key to redistributed the land in a manner that
will reach an efficient outcome or at least a low deadweight loss
outcome and allow owners access to financial capital that can be used to
obtain physical capital. The banking system is the only way out in these
countries.

This is what it actually gets down to.  It is the age old argument (not a
real argument but more of a self serving religious dogma foisted on the
public by self interested rentiers of all stripes) about the &quot;efficiency&quot;
of &quot;private enterprise&quot; as compared to the supposed &quot;inefficiencies&quot; of
governments; the continual contention of Republicons that government
collects taxes to support the consumption and life styles of those who are
part of the government and otherwise throws the tax collections into the
sea.  The realities of actually observing the &quot;life styles of the rich and
famous&quot; when compared to the rather pedestrian life styles of government
employees would seem to belie this ridiculous charge. The handouts to
industry of the Republican Party dominated governments are starkly
evident.  And that is even worse that &quot;throwing the money into the sea&quot;.
And arguments concerning the efficiencies of government do not seem to
have much to do with reality either. The supposed &quot;charge&quot; is based
instead on a fictitious &quot;belief&quot; system concerning the magical powers of a
free market in solving problems that are demonstrably immune to free
market solutions.  AT the same time, the land monopoly, which is as non
free market as it gets, is defended with vigor by BOTH political parties.

There is little need for theoretical treatment or hypothesis.  The last 60
years provides irrefutable evidence based on hard data. Republicans and
neoclassical economists are liars.  Henry George is not a perfect saint
either and most certainly the classical school (Marx aside) sought to
legitimize and excuse the flow of economic rent into the hands of the
nobility. But the latest bevy of &quot;economists&quot; are the worst in history.
Some of the &quot;leaders&quot; of this latter day crew are less deserving of the
term &quot;liar&quot; than others.  Milton Friedman may have been wrong on occasion
but he wasn't a liar.  I am of the opinion that this also applies to Von
Misses a lot.  But most of the others seem to be bought and paid for
shills of a wannabe aristocracy.

You miss the point. Without the banking system, the potential users do
not have the resources to bid for the land. The problem is the highly
stratified society that is the result of a lack of a banking system and
the caste system. The poor peasant still has no means to make a bid if
the government extracts rent. He still needs a bank loan to buy the
property. So no they could not bid without banks.

healthy strong banking systems. Banks help the profit motive do it is

Bubble making is not caused by banks. It is caused by expectations that
are off the mark. Banks do not intentionally make bad loans to buy
property. A bad loan is a loss. Banks only make money when people pay
the interest. That is why lending is almost nonexistant in rural India
because the legal system is weak in securing payment. Defaulted loans
are very bad for the bank. You don't get the interest and run a risk of
a market downturn meaning you don't even get the principle you loaned back.

To say government interference often does not end up in the best mix of
goods and services or less goods and services does not say taxes are
thrown into the sea. Read up on a chapter on  efficiency in a micro
textbook. You will see a simple formula that states Total Surplus =
Value to the buyer - price paid + price received - willingness to sell +
tax revenue. So if the assumption is tax money is thrown in the sea why
is it part of total surplus?

Again the Trucker fails to understand even basic economic concepts and
equates fewer goods and services or a less preferable mix of goods and
services with throwing tax money into the sea.

There is the Libertarian option of last resort armed rebellion. The
peasants should have taken up blades, guns and whatever they had and
just started killing the landowners. Make the government act to be
fair. Of course they could have refused to pay and made the government
have to step-in. If those cowards don't want to take advantage of
their rights to freedom and if necessary to use force then let them
starve.

&gt; shipping services. No banks will not do that but people who borrow from
&gt; banks will see the profit in it. A road or a bridge is neither non-rival
&gt; nor non-excludable.

&gt;&gt; or shcools or hospitals or any other form of real capital formation.

&gt; No but those with profits motives will. Banks are the backbone of
&gt; capital formation. Look at every poor country in the world and you will
&gt; a lack of banking or a bad banking system. Every rich country has
&gt; healthy strong banking systems. Banks help the profit motive do it is
&gt; job and create a middle class. They allow people who were not born with
&gt; silver spoons in their mouth to access the financial capital to invest.
&gt; Without them you have the rich and the poor and not much in between.

&gt;&gt;  Rather banks will simply try to make money by participating in bubble
&gt;&gt; making through making bad loans to buy property, to take over existing
&gt;&gt; companies, and to trade stock and bonds and derivatives.

&gt; Bubble making is not caused by banks. It is caused by expectations that
&gt; are off the mark. Banks do not intentionally make bad loans to buy
&gt; property. A bad loan is a loss. Banks only make money when people pay
&gt; the interest. That is why lending is almost nonexistant in rural India
&gt; because the legal system is weak in securing payment. Defaulted loans
&gt; are very bad for the bank. You don't get the interest and run a risk of
&gt; a market downturn meaning you don't even get the principle you loaned back.

Nope.  I think we're talking past each other here.  The tax burden over the
decades has steadily been shifted from idle land ownership to productive
endeavours.  This has caused the land to yield more income.  Because of this,
property values have increased and banks have been able to lend more money
against that land.  This has only served to enrich the banks with interest
income and increase the value of current property owners' land.  Under a system
of land taxation those who owned the land paid the tax.  Now we have the
productive paying interest to banks and paying the income taxes that invariable
is spent in ways that increase the value of land for landowners who do nothing.
This doesn't mean I don't see the bank system as being a vital cog in the
economy or having an even more valuable role.  It simply means banks no longer
lend money for real capital formation and real industry.  By real capital
formation I mean stuff like factory machinery, inventions, etc.  Banks have
found they can get rich quick more quickly by making real estate loans, playing
games with derivatives, etc.  That is the inevitable evil of rent seeking
behaviour -- the only way to survive it is to engage in it yourself ... then
watch the entire economy and society decay and erode from your offshore tax shelter.

Wrong land taxes were never common place on the national level. Tariffs
were the source of income for the government. Tariffs were changed into
income taxes in the US and income and sales taxes in other countries.

Land taxes are actually more common place for state and local
governments. These have kept income and sales taxes lower in states with
land taxes.

Land taxes have only been common in the United States more recently. You
do realize originally in the US you had to be a land owner to vote.

&gt; To say government interference often does not end up in the best mix of

&gt; is it part of total surplus?

&gt; Again the Trucker fails to understand even basic economic concepts and

&gt;&gt; The realities of actually observing the &quot;life styles of the rich and

legitimize and excuse the flow of economic rent into the hands of the

Some of the &quot;leaders&quot; of this latter day crew are less deserving of the

You don't understand tax incidence versus statutory burden. Sure if I am
a landowner I pay the tax to the government. I write the check. How much
of it comes out of my pocket? If we have the elasticity of supply for
land and elasticity of supply for rental land as 0 then price drops by
the amount of the tax. I pay all the tax. This is the traditional
assertion that has not be backed up by data.

Now if the traditional assumption does not exist then because I decide
how much land to rent or sell I can withdraw some land from the market
and not sell or rent it. Doing so means price does not fall by the tax.
So lets say I rent for $100 a month before tax and $90 a month after
tax. The tax is $15. Note here that my rents only drop by $10 so I am
receiving only $10 less. That means $5 of the tax is paid by the renter
and I pay $10.

They haven't gone away and the steady fall you speak was due to the high
interest rates to fight inflation from 1980 to 1990 and 1991 to 2001.
High interest rates mean less demand for land which mean prices do not
grow as much which means LVT grow more slowly. In contrast incomes and

Investment is expenditures on capital goods. The equality of savings to
investment is a theoretical result that is important in macro models. It
has nothing to do with how investment is measured. It is measured like
government expenditures or consumption. The data totals sales of new
capital goods, construction, etc. It also includes inventory changes. It
does measure how much people save. Theory gives a result that savings
must equal investment but the GDP calculations do not measure savings as
investment.

&gt;&gt; real estate boom of the 1980's when people no longer bought land to
&gt;&gt; avoid taxes.

&gt; &quot;People no longer bought land to avoid taxes&quot;?  How can a reduction in
&gt; demand cause a real estate boom?
">

It was an increase in supply not a reduction in demand. The reduction in
demand was slight as best. Prior to Reagan people held real estate as a
tax shelter. It helped them to avoid taxes. When the 1986 tax reform
eliminated that deduction they offered the land for sale. This increased
supply brought prices down (part of why LVT revenues are declining) and
caused a boom in the market.

Not when you don't see the whole picture. However, I wouldn't expect
someone who doesn't know what Investment is in the GDP equation to see
the big picture without a little help.

No land does not deprecation for tax purposes only the structures on it.
If you have turbo tax try this. Enter a number for your real estate.
Then make up a number for the value of the land. You will notice if you
change that it does not cause more deprecation.  This is part of what
the Reagan tax code it made it where land was no longer depricable. Only
the improvements on it. So capital is depricable but land is not. Land
is not depricable.

&gt;&gt; that eliminate the tax shelter in land. Something George would have

&gt; Before WW II, most taxation in the USA was

&gt; and 1917, when the USA entered WW I, most tax revenue taised in the

&gt; value) now account for only about 10% of all government revenue at all
&gt; levels:

Why? Because other taxes were instituted. As I said land taxation has
not fallen. It has grown just more slowly than income and sales tax
revenue. Your argument implies that land taxes have been decreased. This
is not true. They collect more than ever it is just since 1914 we have a
national income tax that gains much more revenue and a bigger percentage
of revenue. You are trying to imply land taxes have fallen which is
patently false.

Due to other sources being added in which revenue from such have grown

&gt;&gt; Land taxes have only been common in the United States more recently.

I would like to see a historian make this claim. Any citations to back
this up. I mean real citations not Alex Jones or some other internet
conspiracy theorist. I don't recall their being a constitutional crisis
over land taxes. Slavery yes. Land taxes no. Oh yeah slavery is land
ownership in your vocabulary. So you must equating Dred Scott to a fight

Which has the oil boom going on now? This has nothing to do with LVT.
Again Roy throws two facts together and asserts one caused the other.
Pseudo-science at its worst. He has no theory to show why a higher LVT
makes the economy better. Other than a little less speculation. Roy does
not realize a .4% tax will get rid of speculation just like a 4% tax.

Funny I was actually in support of a LVT before Roy argued it. I didn't
think it was an uber tax but a good tax. Now I am not sure after hearing
these convoluted arguments. Never fear though. A look back at some real
science will remind me this is just a smoke screen caused by tale told
by an idiot full of sound and fury but siginifing nothing. A look back
at the science and a remembrance that people other than blind idiot
zealots who can not look at anything objectively have some support will
clear that up soon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Under a system of land taxation those who owned

&gt;&gt; The statutory burden says that. For that to hold with incidence the
&gt;&gt; assertion that the elasticity of supply of land is 0 must hold. Several
&gt;&gt; studies are showing this might not be true.

&gt; You are lying, of course.  No study has ever shown that.  A few paid
&gt; liars have claimed it is possible on theoretical grounds, by first
&gt; changing the definitions and making the theory false.

Wrong. I posted the citations. One should the elasticity of supply of
urban land was not zero. The other was a little less conclusive showing
that 0 is an outlier, that means some land somewhere was estimated at 0
elasticity of supply. However, elasticity of land supply was not 0 in
most estimates.

This was science Roy refuses to see that because it does not fit his
image of the world. As soon as the perfectly inelastic assumption falls
the whole idea of efficiency and no tax shifting goes with it. That
leaves LVT as a good tax with some benefits of not changing how the land
is used by much but not an efficient tax.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The idea of no tax shifting

&gt; You are lying again, as usual.  It does not rest on assertions but

Roy does not realise the difference between definition and assumption.
Elasticity of supply is a definition. 0 elasticity of supply is an
assumption. One that hasn't been tested much but the test I saw said it
did not hold.

Roy wants to believe now that land taxes do not exist in the US nor have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

All do tax the raw value of the land. So yes there is an LVT and an
improvement tax. Now the value of raw land is not estimated well in most
cases and this is a huge hurdle to implement an accurate tax on the
value of raw land. It would need more detailed appraisal then is
currently done. Most places value raw land as a percentage of total value.

Really then what are the loans going to? The tooth fairy. What about all
those government backed small business loans? Granted a lot of bank
loans are consumer for new cars etc. However, few loans are just for raw
land. A housing loan for new construction is a loan for capital (the
structure) and land. You need some data to back up that banks don't loan
for investment. You won't find it. Banks make a lot of investment loans
and investment does not come all from retained earnings, bonds and
stocks. Many people take out loans to buy equipment and build
structures. When I first started my practice my capital expenditures
were financed by a bank.
