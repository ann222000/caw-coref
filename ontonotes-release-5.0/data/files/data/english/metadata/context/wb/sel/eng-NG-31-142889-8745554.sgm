I have a better idea since you love to use this show me stuff.  How
about you for once showing they did not prophecy in tongues and did
not do it 20 times.  We do have a verse that does say to interpret
tongues, so it seems someone was using tongues and others interpreting

If people like you that do not believe, one could give it to you a

just do not want to hear, like a preacher giving a invitation to
accept Christ every time they preach and for a year no one comes, does
that mean the invitation was useless, and Jesus does not save?   The
person is the mouth piece of God as the Bible says that it is the HOLY
GHOST/SPIRIT speaking thur that person as prophesies has to be of God

Again you do not speak for God, and how many times have you posted
this NOWHERE, ANYWHERE, ONE VERSE dump remark and I may self have give
many verses and pointed out, NO not ONE but many verses.  Now put your

No where in scripture does it say a person needs permission.  You'll
notice that if anything is revealed, the one talking shuts up and lets
the other speak - one at a time - nothing about permission.

The KJV version has &quot;and let the prophets judge,&quot; but this was after
the word was given.  The point of this passage has Paul admonishing to
not let everyone speak at once - not to stifle the Spirit.

It seems you like to do your silly plonked stuff again, knowing it

it does plonk yourself from reading those replies.  That do show all
readers you have no biblical answers and you will twist what ever you
want to say what ever you think, even if the scripture says
otherwise.  I do know the scriptures and that seems to be what is your
big problem.  I am not intimidated or worried by any thing you say, as
the bible is on my side.  You can not discuss anything as your premise
is in the foundations of falsehoods and misinterpretation of
scripture.  Nothing I ever said evokes lies on my side, but it sure
seems it does on yours, as you like to play your game of ignorant with
all that NO NOT ONE VERSE, or NO SCRIPTURE only I do find those verses
and it seems rub your face in them, and that is the only real reason
beside your pride and ego, to stop me, from showing your wrong.

Why bother, good guest ion, then I bother as the bible does again say
to give an answer to all that ask.  Then you can not give a biblical
answer that is in a foundation of the bible.
It is interesting also that he gives me the power to scripture
twisting when what I quote is in context with the location and cut and
paste from my Bible program.  Anyone with some knowledge of the Bible

services doesn't matter as I did give you the verses where one word

problem is you made it &quot;vain&quot; and &quot;worthless&quot; repetition and I prove
by the bible many times a word is used many times and are not VAIN or
WORTHLESS.

Then speaking in tongues what all the Apostles did on the Day of
Pentecost and even Paul 20 years later was doing and showing that the
church was doing when they met, you call VAIN, showing as I have

&gt; &gt;same person prophesying 20 times as he/she is given permission to do
&gt; &gt;so.  You must make it up as you want or add to the word, as there is
&gt; &gt;nothing in those verses limiting one by one the times they may
&gt; &gt;prophecies.

&gt; We are not talking about 20 DIFFERENT people prophesying one by one.
&gt; We are talking about ONE person babbling the SAME THING over and over
&gt; again 20 times.

&gt; Talking to you is lower than talking to a three year old.  At least
&gt; the three year old is less likely to lie and more likely to follow the
&gt; conversation accurately.  Go figure.

Yeah a three year old knows not to accept your foolishness also.  More
likely they will not know you lied.  Yes go figure, if you can, that
would be nice, if you could support your statements by scripture would
be nice also.  Then it seems all you do is say the bible does not say
and use what the bible does not say to support your statements, even a
three year old knows better then to try that.  Then a three year old
does ask why, and when I ask why like those three years old and tell
you to give what the scripture does say to do I do!  You killfile or
some other silly childless name.  I pray you can get saved from
yourself, and find the real love of Jesus and that you're false
teaching will be seen for the falsehoods they are.

Below shows your foolisness and lack of proving your statements by
scripture, only like a child you do what you did below.  Not the ways
of a wise person.

&gt; &gt;You seem so ignorant, a person can prophecy 20 times and never say the
&gt; &gt;same thing over and over with their cap lock on.

&gt; The person wo began this thread said &quot;what about the person who says.
&gt; . .20 times in a row?&quot;
">

NO YOU SAID THAT and then like other false statements, you again like
Steve use to do cut out what was said and replace it with the &quot;......&quot;
dots so one can not see what really was said.
The original was about a person prophesying and to you it would sound
like they said the same thing over and over again.  You then used the
vain repetitions to make your point, only did not prove what was said
was vain or repetitions.  Then you want and limited it to a one WORD,
and mocked anyone that would say the same thing twenty times, of which
I showed by the Bible many verses that show the same Word and Words
were used over and over again in the same message or chapter.  Which
when you found out how foolish your statement looked, you try again to
add to it or change what was said.

&gt; No where in scripture does it say a person needs permission.  You'll
&gt; notice that if anything is revealed, the one talking shuts up and lets
&gt; the other speak - one at a time - nothing about permission.

&gt; The KJV version has &quot;and let the prophets judge,&quot; but this was after
&gt; the word was given.  The point of this passage has Paul admonishing to
&gt; not let everyone speak at once - not to stifle the Spirit.

I disagree with your understanding, I am not saying somone else needs
to be the one giving the permission, we ourselfs seeing that if all
spoke at once it would be hard for others to understand so we give
ourself permission not to speak and to wait on others.   Paul had to
point it out, as it seem people did not let others go frist, just like
this post, I did not have to reply to you, but I am as I gave myself
the permission or the right to do so.   I can not give you permission
to reply or not to reply, that again is up to you and if you will let
yourself post.  We do not need to get the OK from others, but because
we honor others and want all to be done in order, we limit ourself as
the Bible says our spirit is subject to ourselve.  1 Cor 14:32-33
32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 33 For
God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the

Err! women had such any such &quot;permission&quot; removed by the Lord's command when
in the Churches.
Checking in on the next verses we read........... &quot;As in all the churches of
the saints, 34 the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are
not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. 35
If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at
home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 36 What! Did the
word of God originate with you, or are you the only ones it has reached?
37 If any one thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should
acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.&quot; 1 Cor
14:33-37 (RSV)

End of story....It's the Lord's command.

Please acknowledge it those who are really &quot;spiritual&quot; among  you. {;o;}

Jeff...
&quot;11 Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. 12 I permit no
woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent. 13 For
Adam was formed first, then Eve; 14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman
was deceived and became a transgressor. 15 Yet woman will be saved through
bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with
modesty.&quot; 1 Tim 2:11-15 (RSV)

&gt; You said it, I didn't!  Nice to see you know what you wrote.

&gt;&gt; Your man-made garbage doesn't fly raymond.  It just sinks deeper into

&gt; No garbage does not fly unless your tossing it around like you trying

&gt; and know where you are also.  That is a pity.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Show me ONE SCRIPTURE ANYWHERE where ANYONE &quot;prophesied in tongues&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same message 20 times.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have a better idea since you love to use this show me stuff.  How
&gt;&gt; &gt;about you for once showing they did not prophecy in tongues and did
&gt;&gt; &gt;not do it 20 times.  We do have a verse that does say to interpret
&gt;&gt; &gt;tongues, so it seems someone was using tongues and others interpreting
&gt;&gt; &gt;it,

&gt;&gt; I have already shown you that such a verse doesn't exist.  But it may
&gt;&gt; be found in Matthew 29:15-36. . .if you want to look.

&gt; I told you you could not find such, It seems you will even make up
&gt; chapters where there is none, then who said you were honest or a
&gt; person of integrity?  Thank you, I was not sure if you were a fool but
&gt; that takes all the question out of it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you give such a &quot;prophesy&quot; in tongues 20 times, you are not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speaking as the mouthpiece of God, you are doing something else.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; phenomenon you are describing is NOTHING that is described by God as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coming from Him.

&gt;&gt; &gt;If people like you that do not believe, one could give it to you a

Thank you for reply, I have pointed out many times that Checker is
confused about a lot of stuff.  Oh don't get worried he will call you
a liar also, as that seems to be all he can do.  I not sure what you
wrote and posted here, so will leave that alone.  According to what
Checker wrote he has again plonk me or killfile me, as he keeps doing,
till he changes his name again and logs in under another fake name, so
he can not be seen as a liar, as he will not be Checker next time he
writes me, and tries to hide who he is, and start over again.  I sorry
Rico he does not know what or whom he is writing to.  I know, I made a
mistake once here on who wrote, and this Checker person made a month
or so calling me a liar and such, and acted like I never said I made a
mistake, he/she seems not to be able to even say he/she made a
mistake, maybe they think the building will fall on them?

Have a nice day, and I hope you have a better time with him/her then I
have had.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;only says that they were speaking in tongues.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And NO verses in the Bible say they EVER did it 20 times at once.

&gt; &gt; Thank you, you had the BUT to start with and I answered your BUT so
&gt; &gt; why do you think you can BUT anything.   Then I am sure they went to
&gt; &gt; the worship more then 20 times, and they gave their tithes more then
&gt; &gt; 20 times, and the name of Jesus is more then 20 times, shall we go on?

&gt; &gt;&gt; BUT

&gt; &gt;&gt; God is NOT a god of confusion:

&gt; &gt; Then you are not a god, but still seem to think confusion is the way
&gt; &gt; of life for your BUT this and that, and not a single verse, or no
&gt; &gt; where in the Bible this or that, you are all in confusion so we know
&gt; &gt; your not getting such from GOD, thank you for pointing that out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1 Cor 14:30-33
&gt; &gt;&gt; 30 But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first
&gt; &gt;&gt; keep silent. 31 For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may
&gt; &gt;&gt; learn and all may be encouraged. 32 And the spirits of the prophets
&gt; &gt;&gt; are subject to the prophets. 33 For God  is not the author of
&gt; &gt;&gt; confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
&gt; &gt;&gt; NKJV

&gt; &gt; Oh my how many times or how many people can the ALL  CAN PROPHESY, ONE
&gt; &gt; BY ONE? If there is more then 20 folks there we get one by one or the
&gt; &gt; same person prophesying 20 times as he/she is given permission to do
&gt; &gt; so.  You must make it up as you want or add to the word, as there is
&gt; &gt; nothing in those verses limiting one by one the times they may

&gt; &gt; You seem so ignorant, a person can prophecy 20 times and never say the
&gt; &gt; same thing over and over with their cap lock on.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Now. . .DID YOU pay attention to ALL 20 of those things I just wrote?

&gt; &gt; Nope! My mother did not raise a fool, only a fool would waste time
&gt; &gt; playing your game or reading what you wrote, did you count how many
&gt; &gt; times, I didn't.   Then I sure God would love to hear someone tell Him
&gt; &gt; how much they love Him in any tongue at least 20 times.  In fact the
&gt; &gt; bible says to praise the Lord aways, how many times is always????
&gt; &gt; Acts 10:1-2
&gt; &gt; 2 a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, who
&gt; &gt; gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always .
&gt; &gt; NKJV

&gt; &gt; 1 Cor 1:4

&gt; &gt; I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was
&gt; &gt; given to you by Christ Jesus,
&gt; &gt; NKJV

&gt; &gt; 2 Cor 2:14-15

&gt; &gt; 14 Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and
&gt; &gt; through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.
&gt; &gt; NKJV

&gt; &gt; Eph 6:17-20
&gt; &gt; 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
&gt; &gt; which is the word of God; 18 praying always with all prayer and
&gt; &gt; supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all
&gt; &gt; perseverance and supplication for all the saints -  19 and for me,
&gt; &gt; that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to
&gt; &gt; make known the mystery of the gospel,
&gt; &gt; NKJV

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do you expect God or any other man to pay attention to such
&gt; &gt;&gt; clap=trap as ANYTHING repeated 20 times over and over again?

&gt; &gt; You said it, I didn't!  Nice to see you know what you wrote.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Your man-made garbage doesn't fly raymond.  It just sinks deeper into
&gt; &gt;&gt; the dung-heap.

&gt; &gt; No garbage does not fly unless your tossing it around like you trying
&gt; &gt; to do here.   Then you should know, it seems you on the receiving side
&gt; &gt; and know where you are also.  That is a pity.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Show me ONE SCRIPTURE ANYWHERE where ANYONE &quot;prophesied in tongues&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same message 20 times.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have a better idea since you love to use this show me stuff.  How
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about you for once showing they did not prophecy in tongues and did
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;not do it 20 times.  We do have a verse that does say to interpret
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;tongues, so it seems someone was using tongues and others interpreting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have already shown you that such a verse doesn't exist.  But it may
&gt; &gt;&gt; be found in Matthew 29:15-36. . .if you want to look.

&gt; &gt; I told you you could not find such, It seems you will even make up
&gt; &gt; chapters where there is none, then who said you were honest or a
&gt; &gt; person of integrity?  Thank you, I was not sure if you were a fool but
&gt; &gt; that takes all the question out of it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you give such a &quot;prophesy&quot; in tongues 20 times, you are not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speaking as the mouthpiece of God, you are doing something else.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; phenomenon you are describing is NOTHING that is described by God as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coming from Him.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If people like you that do not believe, one could give it to you a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hundred times and still never be accepted.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If people like you who DO believe in fables, one HAS to give it to you

&gt; &gt; Then people like me, do not accept your fables and that just gets to
&gt; &gt; you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; a hundred times to be accepted.  But let's just go for 20.  If people

Thank you, it about time you told the truth, since nothing you said
was truth you stand by nothing, then that is solid and I agree you
could not tell the truth.  It would seem, and what you call truth is
not biblical so it is not bible truth.  Then people can check with
Google all the people that said you are lying and are a liar, over the
years, even if you did change your name a few times.  Some of those
post you pointed to was your own words, under you other names, such as
when you called yourself &quot;Christian&quot; and I showed you than you were
not, and of course you called me a liar.  Then your fruits does stand
solid by themselves you are the liar in these newsgroups.

&gt; So the only BUT here is you.

&gt; &gt;Then you are not a god, but still seem to think confusion is the way

&gt; &gt;Oh my how many times or how many people can the ALL  CAN PROPHESY, ONE

&gt; &gt;so.  You must make it up as you want or add to the word, as there is
&gt; &gt;nothing in those verses limiting one by one the times they may

&gt; We are not talking about 20 DIFFERENT people prophesying one by one.
&gt; We are talking about ONE person babbling the SAME THING over and over

&gt; Talking to you is lower than talking to a three year old.  At least

&gt; &gt;You seem so ignorant, a person can prophecy 20 times and never say the

&gt; The person wo began this thread said &quot;what about the person who says.
&gt; . .20 times in a row?&quot;

&gt; So that is the context of this conversation (which you can't seem to
&gt; follow).

&gt; And so far you have NOT found any BIBLICAL basis for me to believe
&gt; that such a worthlessly repeptitious babbling would be from God.
&gt; NOTHING SIMILAR OCCURS FROM GOD ANYWHERE IN THE BIBLE.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Now. . .DID YOU pay attention to ALL 20 of those things I just wrote?

&gt; &gt;Nope! My mother did not raise a fool, only a fool would waste time
&gt; &gt;playing your game or reading what you wrote, did you count how many
&gt; &gt;times, I didn't.

&gt; You are CERTAINLY wrong about what your mother did or did not raise!
&gt; LOL!

&gt; Yet you seem to think that if a person repeated the same thing twenty
&gt; times in a row JUST LIKE THAT, it must be from God, and certainly
&gt; can't be worthless repetition.

&gt; &gt;Then I sure God would love to hear someone tell Him
&gt; &gt;how much they love Him in any tongue at least 20 times.  In fact the
&gt; &gt;bible says to praise the Lord aways, how many times is always????
&gt; &gt;Acts 10:1-2
&gt; &gt; 2 a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, who
&gt; &gt;gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always .
&gt; &gt;NKJV

&gt; Acts 10:1-2
&gt; 10:1 At Caesare'a there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what
&gt; was known as the Italian Cohort, 2 a devout man who feared God with
&gt; all his household, gave alms liberally to the people, and prayed
&gt; constantly to God.
&gt; RSV

&gt; So you think that Cornelius just walked around doing NOTHING ELSE but
&gt; praying?

&gt; You REALLY like to make passages from the Bible look like they are
&gt; saying stuff they DON'T SAY, don't you, ray?

&gt; &gt;1 Cor 1:4

&gt; &gt;I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was
&gt; &gt;given to you by Christ Jesus,
&gt; &gt;NKJV

&gt; God gives grace.  Of course, now you would PRETEND that Paul did
&gt; nothing but walk around praying, not eating, not talking to others
&gt; about Jesus, etc.

&gt; More INTENTIONAL DISTORTION of the meaning of scripture by ray.
&gt; Go figure!

&gt; &gt;2 Cor 2:14-15

&gt; &gt;14 Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and
&gt; &gt;through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.
&gt; &gt;NKJV

&gt; More INTENTIONAL DISTORTION by ray.  HE thinks that Paul didn't eat,
&gt; sleep, or talk to anyone; HE thinks these passages mean that Paul did
&gt; NOTHING ELSE but pray during his WHOLE LIFE.

&gt; Go figure!  RAY THE LIAR LIES AGAIN!

&gt; &gt;Eph 6:17-20
&gt; &gt;17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
&gt; &gt;which is the word of God; 18 praying always with all prayer and
&gt; &gt;supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all
&gt; &gt;perseverance and supplication for all the saints -  19 and for me,
&gt; &gt;that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to
&gt; &gt;make known the mystery of the gospel,
&gt; &gt;NKJV

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do you expect God or any other man to pay attention to such
&gt; &gt;&gt; clap=trap as ANYTHING repeated 20 times over and over again?

&gt; &gt;You said it, I didn't!  Nice to see you know what you wrote.

&gt; No raymond, I DIDN'T say it.  I answered the person who asked, &quot;If
&gt; someone said. . .in tongues 20 times in a row, would you consider it
&gt; to be from God?&quot;  And my answer is NO.

&gt; You are the one who is trying to claim that the clap-trap of 20 times
&gt; over and over again in a row WOULD BE from God.

&gt; You can't even remember your own argument!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Your man-made garbage doesn't fly raymond.  It just sinks deeper into
&gt; &gt;&gt; the dung-heap.

&gt; &gt;No garbage does not fly unless your tossing it around like you trying
&gt; &gt;to do here.   Then you should know, it seems you on the receiving side
&gt; &gt;and know where you are also.  That is a pity.

&gt; I DO receive a lot of garbage from you rayray, but that doesn't
&gt; matter.  I pray for your poor confused soul regularly anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Show me ONE SCRIPTURE ANYWHERE where ANYONE &quot;prophesied in tongues&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same message 20 times.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have a better idea since you love to use this show me stuff.  How
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about you for once showing they did not prophecy in tongues and did
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;not do it 20 times.  We do have a verse that does say to interpret
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;tongues, so it seems someone was using tongues and others interpreting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have already shown you that such a verse doesn't exist.  But it may
&gt; &gt;&gt; be found in Matthew 29:15-36. . .if you want to look.

&gt; &gt;I told you you could not find such, It seems you will even make up
&gt; &gt;chapters where there is none, then who said you were honest or a
&gt; &gt;person of integrity?  Thank you, I was not sure if you were a fool but
&gt; &gt;that takes all the question out of it.

&gt; Of course I can't find a verse that says you should &quot;prophesy&quot; the
&gt; same prophesy over and over and over again in the Bible.  It isn't
&gt; there.

&gt; But you are intellectually unable to comprehend that if it isn't
&gt; there, you SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT.

&gt; Your intellectual capacity is less than that of a five year old!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you give such a &quot;prophesy&quot; in tongues 20 times, you are not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speaking as the mouthpiece of God, you are doing something else.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; phenomenon you are describing is

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Oh my how many times or how many people can the ALL  CAN PROPHESY, ONE
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;BY ONE? If there is more then 20 folks there we get one by one or the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;same person prophesying 20 times as he/she is given permission to do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;so.  You must make it up as you want or add to the word, as there is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;nothing in those verses limiting one by one the times they may

&gt; &gt; &gt;No where in scripture does it say a person needs permission.  You'll
&gt; &gt; &gt;notice that if anything is revealed, the one talking shuts up and lets
&gt; &gt; &gt;the other speak - one at a time - nothing about permission.

&gt; &gt; &gt;The KJV version has &quot;and let the prophets judge,&quot; but this was after
&gt; &gt; &gt;the word was given.  The point of this passage has Paul admonishing to
&gt; &gt; &gt;not let everyone speak at once - not to stifle the Spirit.

&gt; &gt; I just *plonked* raymond to the killfile again.  He can't think above
&gt; &gt; the level of about a three-year-old as you can plainly see.  Trying to
&gt; &gt; discuss anything with him only evokes lies and scripture-twisting from
&gt; &gt; him.  So why bother.

&gt; It seems you like to do your silly plonked stuff again, knowing it
&gt; means nothing at all, as it does not stop me from replying to you, but
&gt; it does plonk yourself from reading those replies.  That do show all
&gt; readers you have no biblical answers and you will twist what ever you
&gt; want to say what ever you think, even if the scripture says
&gt; otherwise.  I do know the scriptures and that seems to be what is your
&gt; big problem.  I am not intimidated or worried by any thing you say, as
&gt; the bible is on my side.  You can not discuss anything as your premise
&gt; is in the foundations of falsehoods and misinterpretation of
&gt; scripture.  Nothing I ever said evokes lies on my side, but it sure
&gt; seems it does on yours, as you like to play your game of ignorant with
&gt; all that NO NOT ONE VERSE, or NO SCRIPTURE only I do find those verses
&gt; and it seems rub your face in them, and that is the only real reason
&gt; beside your pride and ego, to stop me, from showing your wrong.

&gt; Why bother, good guest ion, then I bother as the bible does again say
&gt; to give an answer to all that ask.  Then you can not give a biblical
&gt; answer that is in a foundation of the bible.
&gt; It is interesting also that he gives me the power to scripture
&gt; twisting when what I quote is in context with the location and cut and
&gt; paste from my Bible program.  Anyone with some knowledge of the Bible
&gt; can see what is written and find that what I post does directly answer
&gt; his statements.   All you foolish plonking will do you no good, but
&gt; will show the readers what the Bible does start.

&gt; &gt; I can't see his posts any more, and that is a GOOD thing.

&gt; The words of a looser and one that can not defend their false
&gt; premises. I suppose we should all pray for him and ask the Good Lord
&gt; to open his heart and not reject what he can not defend and to know
&gt; when the Bible is correct.

&gt; Oh don't worry readers, be assured he will be back as I not sure how
&gt; many times he said he has kill-filed me, he is like a sickness, it
&gt; likes to come back when it thinks no one is watching.  It is wonderful
&gt; to have a wireless notebook computer that does go with me, no matter
&gt; what part of the earth I am in.

&gt; &gt; in the Name of Jesus,
&gt; &gt; Checker

&gt; I wonder what his next name will be now, as he has changed them when
&gt; ever he can not prove his false teachings, and I show up to point out
&gt; what the Bible does say on those teachings.

&gt; God bless and may you feel the presents of the Holy Spirit in all you
&gt; do.

&gt;   There is NOTHING in the Bible-- save one single verse-- that says we
&gt; are to &quot;pray in tongues.&quot;  And there is not one single verse in the
&gt; Bible that indicates any apostle or disciple -- or Jesus-- or any
&gt; prophet EVER EVER &quot;prayed in tongues.&quot;
&gt;   It's pitiful, really, when an entire THEOLOGY is built upon a total
&gt; misunderstanding of one statement Paul uttered.
&gt; 1CO 13:1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels... but have
&gt; not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
&gt;   And they / you focus on that one phrase... If I speak... in the
&gt; tongues... of angels....&quot;  and you IGNORE COMPLETELY  the rest, &quot;but
&gt; have not love... I am a resounding GONG or a clanging cymbal.&quot;

&gt;   Why do you IGNORE the rest of that sentence?

&gt;   Because the rest of it doesn't allow you to PRETEND that you &quot;pray
&gt; in tongues!&quot;

&gt;  Now show me a verse -- ANY verse-- that says you can or that you
&gt; ought to &quot;pray in tongues.&quot;

&gt;   Explain to me, then, the PURPOSE of &quot;praying in tongues.&quot;

&gt;   A common sense, rational person would realize that there is
&gt; absolutely NO purpose to &quot;praying in tongues.&quot;

&gt;   God knows our every need before we even begin to pray. God speaks
&gt; every language spoken.  So what purpose is there to &quot;praying in
&gt; tongues?&quot;  If it is a &quot;language of angels,&quot; please tell me what RIGHT
&gt; we have as mortal men to speak in the language of angels?

&gt;   And if God can read our hearts, if He knows our inmost thoughts, why
&gt; would we need to communicate in a &quot;language the angels use?&quot;

&gt;   We don't!

&gt;   Why would the angels need to communicate with God in a language men
&gt; have never heard?

&gt;   They don't!

&gt;   God can communicate with us without words! Likewise, God can
&gt; communicate with angels without words!

&gt;  Kindly don't play with God by inventing gibberish you choose to call
&gt; &quot;the language of angels.&quot;

&gt;  It's not. It's nonsense!

Uh, listen here, johnnie- YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED to attempt to diagnose
anyone, especially when you are in desperate need of proper diagnosis
yourself.
You should speak to your in-home counselor and ask him or her to
arrange a meeting with a psychiatrist for you.

Quit trying to list all the presumed 'issues' with other people. Look
after your own issues.

Now go take your meds and stop all this foolish arguing.

I feel sorry for you John
being locked in a mental
institution, and all! I hope
that that shot of Thorazine
will quiten you down and
get your poor confused
mind untangled for a while!
So let the nice nurse give
you that shot, and in a few
minutes you'll be off in dream land!
A lobotomy might help your mental

perhaps some Electro shock therapy
might easy your mental anguish! John!

So you say you have logic when they heard them speak in tongues, they
stopped asked what they must do, was told did it and the promise Acts
2:39-40 shows it was for all that the Lord God would call, but to LIAR
CHECKER, you could care less what the Bible did say in context, if it
did not agree with your false teaching the Bible has to be wrong.  You
do not speak for any the rest, as the Pentecostal experience has
reached most all the &quot;WE&quot; in most every church organization world
wide. Millions on millions in most every nation world wide.  You speak
for your small insegnificant few.   The doctrine I used is supported
by man that is for sure, and made by the man-made JESUS and His
Apostles, yours come from a lack of obeying or believing what the
Bible says, and accepting the Bible for what it does say.  You like to
add to it a lot of unbelief and make up statements that they never did
as if you had a verse that says that, while Paul said forbid not to
speak in tongues, you forbid the 3,000 you forbid anyone that has the
truth, as your again prove CHECKER THE LIAR you will do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;and as many as the Lord shall call.  The Lord is the one that did call

&gt; &gt;promise.

&gt; Oh, they DID receive the promise. . .they received the Holy Ghost,
&gt; just as I and all the resto of us Christians who have never spoken in
&gt; tongues HAVE received.  Your man-made pretense that the promise was
&gt; tongues instead of the Holy Ghost is worthless dung.

Oh this is getting to you, the lying tongue of yours is working over
time now &quot;resto&quot; Ha, that is strange.  You never spoke in tongues as
your a unbeliever and if you had any faith in Christ at sometime, may
loose that also. Your playing with the devil now, and even using the
word &quot;DUNG&quot; and the Holy Ghost in the together, can be seen as
unpardonable sin.  Then Liar Checker, you really don't care what lie's
you post and like them that wanted Jesus dead, they denied Him also.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;Since the Bible shows they obeyed what was asked of them,
&gt; &gt;only a unbeliever would ask questions of unbelief as you like to do

&gt; I do not believe your false teaching that every Christian must speak

What else would CHECKER THE LIAR have to say, but to call me a liar
along with his other fake names where he posted I was a liar, and now

Then you mouth may say you believe your words and actions show clearly

that the blessings of the HOLY GHOST will be seen as a Lie to them
that seek Him first.  I am only seen by Liars that hate the truth of

So you ADMIT that the Bible does NOT SAY that they DID use pogo

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; THAT is the kind of argument YOU constantly try to make.  An argument

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;More like that is the only kind of questions you can ask, as  you have

&gt; &gt;&gt; In other words, you are willing to stick to your fallacious arguments.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Go figure.

&gt; &gt;No Checker the LIAR I am asking you to use the Bible to prove your

&gt; And they can look for headers under my moniker as well and then

&gt; You look REALLY bad when they do.

&gt; When you demand we show Bible verses when we have stated that no
&gt; verses are there to support your view, you show that you show that you
&gt; have no concept of logical discourse.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; YOU show me the verses in the Bible that say they did not use pogo
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sticks, and then I will show you the verses that say that the 3,000
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; did not speak in tongues.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You show me first they did not.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You have to show the verses that say they didn't use pogo sticks, THEN
&gt; &gt;&gt; I will.  YOU get to go first.

&gt; &gt;MORE Liars and foolish statements, the Bible also does not use or talk
&gt; &gt;about POGO Sticks, then Checker the Liar that doesn't mean anything to
&gt; &gt;you, you as you do not use what the Bible does say.

&gt; So you ADMIT that the Bible does NOT SAY that they DID use pogo
&gt; sticks.  And based on that understanding, you ADMIT that because the
&gt; Bible does NOT SAY THEY DID, then THEY LIKELY DID NOT.

&gt; Yet you cannot apply your own reasoning to the 3,000 and tongues.  The
&gt; Bible does NOT SAY that they spoke in tongues is a good reason to
&gt; believe THEY DID NOT.

&gt; So you want to use a DOUBLE STANDARD here.  One for pogo sticks.  The
&gt; opposite for the 3,000 and tongues.

&gt; &gt;You just add your
&gt; &gt;two cents in denying what the Bible when it does not fit you false
&gt; &gt;teachings isn't that correct Check the LIAR?  Then you would lie if
&gt; &gt;you did answer that question.

&gt; No lying here raymond (apparently you cannot tell the difference

&gt; &gt;do not do as you do, and put in my own ideas as to what it should
&gt; &gt;say.  I have proven my arguments,

&gt; You have not shown ONE SINGLE SCRIPTURE ANYWHERE that says that EVEN

&gt; You have not shone ONE SINGLE SCRIPTURE ANYWHERE that says every

&gt; &gt;Checker the LIAR, you never once

&gt; &gt;&gt; they did.
&gt; &gt;&gt; We believe the 3000 did NOT speak in tongues because the Bible never
&gt; &gt;&gt; says they did.

&gt; &gt;Your repleting yourself only shows your getting mental and old,
&gt; &gt;forgetting what you wrote and then thinking you are a &quot;WE&quot; when your
&gt; &gt;are only one person, no we, you speak for your own self, no one else
&gt; &gt;Checker the LIAR!

&gt; &quot;Replete,&quot;  &quot;to fill to satisfaction, filled to satisfaction with food
&gt; or drink, (followed by) deeply filled or permeated.&quot;

&gt; No, I did not fill myself with food or drink while posting, raymond.

&gt; BUT I DID SHOW YOUR FEEBLE ATTEMPTS AT &quot;LOGIC&quot; TO BE
&gt; SELF-CONTRADICTORY.

&gt; And after all, People can go to the archives of this newsgroup and
&gt; find LOTS of &quot;Raymond the Liar&quot; headers from LOTS of different people,
&gt; Christians and non-Christians alike.  They can ALL see what your
&gt; reputation is.

&gt; And they can look for headers under my moniker as well and then
&gt; compare.

&gt; So keep up your slander and I will keep reminding folks that they can
&gt; go to the archives, as I have above.  Your reputation as a liar is
&gt; well established, raymond.

&gt; I can cut and paste this FACT all day if you want to keep calling me a
&gt; liar.  You have EARNED your reputation as a liar, raymond.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is logical reasoning.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The story shows
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;they heard they asked and were baptized and the promise was for them,

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not any promise of tongues.  The promise of the HOLY GHOST, which I
&gt; &gt;&gt; and all of the rest of us Christians who have never spoken in tongues
&gt; &gt;&gt; HAVE received, despite your man-made doctrines to the contrary.

&gt; &gt;So you say you have logic when they heard them speak in tongues, they
&gt; &gt;stopped asked what they must do, was told did it

&gt; You left out the sermon by Peter, the REAL REASON they asked what they
&gt; must do.

&gt; &gt;and the promise Acts
&gt; &gt;2:39-40 shows it was for all that the Lord God would call,

&gt; NOT the promise of tongues (NO tongues are involved in Acts 2:39-40 at
&gt; all).

&gt; Acts 2:36-40

&gt; 36 &quot;Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God
&gt; has made Him both Lord and Christ - this Jesus whom you crucified.&quot;

No, you have always said in the context of this discussion that it is 1
wrong to speak in tongues becuase 'it is not a real language' or that it is

I have NEVER said it was wrong to &quot;speak in tongues.&quot;  I have said
that mindless babbling, anything that is NOT real human language IS

I have pointed out that if it IS real tongues (real human languages)
and you don't know what you are saying, then you are violating the
following COMMAND of scripture:

1 Thess 5:19-22
19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all
things; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every form of evil.
NKJV

It is simply TRUE that if you cannot understand that which is coming
out of your mouth and there is nobody there who understands that
language, then YOU CANNOT TEST IT FOR TRUTH and you CAN BE doing
something very evil.

You are so quick to call others liars raymond, when you have a very
BAD reputation as a liar in this newsgroup.  Not very smart of you,

&gt;Oh are you going to say now you have spoke in tongues as the Holy
&gt;Spirit does give that gift, or have you again quenched the Spirit and
&gt;mock them that do obey the Holy Ghost?
">

No, I have not spoken in tongues; the Bible NEVER SAYS that every
Christian speaks in tongues.  The Bible says the opposite:

1 Cor 12:30-31
30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with
tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?
NASU

But the Bible ALSO SAYS:

Rom 8:9
9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the
Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him
NASU

SO
NOT all Christians speak in tongues.
ALL CHRISTIANS HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST DWELLING IN US.

THEREFORE Your claim that I have somehow &quot;quenched&quot; the Holy Ghost
because I have never spoken in tongues IS NOT BIBLICAL.

As I have shown before.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I am holding fast to that what is good, that is again why I do not
&gt;hold to your false doctrines and insults in the Pentecostal newsgroup
&gt;and you are not even pentecostal, your evil is well known.

Yet you have told us that you &quot;speak in tongues&quot; you cannot understand
and you pray that way while there is nobody who DOES understand to
translate for you.

So you CANNOT test what you say (if anything) while praying in your
version of &quot;tongues,&quot; IN VIOLATION OF THE 1 THESS 5:19-22 Scripture,
EXACTLY AS I HAVE SAID.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; IF you cannot TEST what is coming out of your mouth, then you are
&gt;&gt; VIOLATING A COMMAND OF SCRIPTURE.

&gt;If you can not test that the 3,000 did or did not speak in tongues,
&gt;you are violating the command of the scripture by saying they never
&gt;did.  Your words on that are all over you postings in the pentecostal
&gt;newsgroup.
">

I have said that there is NOT ONE SCRIPTURE that says even one of the
3,000 EVER spoke in tongues OR bounced on pogo sticks, and that the
absence of such verses do NOT MAKE IT BECOME that they spoke in
tongues OR bounced on pogo sticks.

YOU PRETEND that the Bible SAYS that every Christian spoke in tongues.
The BIBLE DOES NOT SAY that those 3,000 ever did.

If it did, you would likely have found where it did.  But instead you
choose to call me a liar, opening yourself up for ridicule since you
have such a reputation of your own as &quot;raymond the liar.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Doesn't that bother you even a LITTLE bit, raymond?

&gt;Oh sure it does, that is why I quit playing your game and call you
&gt;what you really are CHECKER THE LIAR even that does bother me, that
&gt;one that says he teaches Sunday school would lie just because his
&gt;students do not read this newsgroup and see what he is doing, YES that
&gt;does bother more then just a little.
">

Since I don't lie and you have never shown me to lie even once, and
since I have seen so MANY posts where you have called so MANY other
Christians liars too, I don't worry about your slander.  It just shows
what you are.

&gt; I have NEVER said it was wrong to &quot;speak in tongues.&quot;  I have said

&gt; NOT BIBLICAL TONGUES.  That is an entirely different thing.

&gt;&gt;I know for a fact tha you said 'speak in tongues', I've always responded

&gt; I have pointed out that if it IS real tongues (real human languages)

&gt; It is simply TRUE that if you cannot understand that which is coming

&gt; language, then YOU CANNOT TEST IT FOR TRUTH and you CAN BE doing
&gt; something very evil.

If I pray in tongues in a church that has over 60 ethnic and linguistic
groups represented and JUST ONE  person either TRANSLATES, RESPONDS WITH
UNDERSTANDING OR EVEN JUST INDICATES THAT THEY ARE LISTENING (theres a
difference between hearing something and listening to something) then I have
the evidence to say that mine is the truth.

I've had Arabic, African, Balkan (Greeks and Macedoneans) and Maltese
speakers in my church all give interpretations when I speak in tongues.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;statement shows he is not honest and will say anything but say he was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;mistaken or was in error.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Which shows your character, raymond.  No, I didn't lie; rico simply
&gt;&gt; &gt;misunderstood what I did say.  That does NOT make either him or me a
&gt;&gt; &gt;liar.  But Rico CAN go to the archives and google &quot;Raymond the Liar&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;and see who and how many people have posted on that thread over the
&gt;&gt; &gt;years.  You have a HORRIBLE reputation, raymond.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  You need to repent.

&gt;&gt; This is typical of the self-righteous finger-pointing that runs rampant on
&gt;&gt; Usenet - they've never heeded the following:

&gt;&gt; Mat 7:5 (NLT)  Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then
&gt;&gt; perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye

&gt;Yes you do need to get rid of that log.   If you read what you wrote,
&gt;you fit that person to a tee.
