Here's Mr. Rrock getting pissed at Shiva for some words he said about
Mark. Yet just the other day Rrock said that Mark was off topic, that
he was stupid, that he should go fuck himeself with an axe and etc.
etc.

O.K. so here's what I think of Rrock. From the day he came here he had
some weird ideas about this group and angels and religion. Well, we
get a lot of people like that. But almost daily after his initial
posts he became more and more trollish. He began flaking out. Using a
robot to screw with my posts (and other people's) taking the name of
my book and claiming he was selling it, while giving a link to a book
from the 1930's. He basically started out here calling people names,
calling me a plagiarist etc. When I told him that titles were not
copyrightable, he got even more vitriolic in his posts, misspelling my
name and cranking his robot up to the max. One day I told him about
the bird that lives here in the Southwest, called a Grackle. Without
even googling the word he accused me of being a liar, making up names
for birds that didn't exist.

You see for all his pandering to Mark, for all his snotty attitude
about how smart or noble or just he thinks he is, he is nothing but a
troll who does not even know anything about law or science or
technology or angels. He simply Googles things WHEN HE WANTS TO to
make himself look smart, yet doesn't know how to Google a word that
made him look like the troll he is! He certainly doesn't know how to
defend himself in a rational argument. Now he is just here screwing
with me and Mark and anyone else who crosses his evil path.

Rrock is the troll. He is the PENULTIMATE troll in my opinion, he has
covered his tracks time and again with lies and falsifications about
why he was here. Look at what he said in the past, compared to now. He
once said he would defend Mark Earnest from me. He is a liar. He does
not like or consider Mark as having a truthful or alternate viewpoint!
He USED Mark Earnest to get into this NG to be a combatative
miscreant. He used cyberspace as his own little play thing with his
post mulching robot. He has made slurs against most of the people here
long before he started buddying up to some of them to become even more
combatative and producing more lies.

It's in the archives folks. So is my stuff. But you won't find me
defending Mark Earnest, or paling around with people I later decided
to hate. Oh yeah, I can be unkind, thoughtless, I can pull pranks and
call myself someone else for awhile...like Titan Uranus. But I do it
to the people who ENJOY fighting WHO BROUGHT THE FIGHT HERE. Rrock
came here under false pretenses to fight with EVERYBODY. He is ruining
the NG slowly but surely filling the archives up with crap. But it's
easy enough to ferret him out of his little hidey hole of lies.

Do you NEVER get tired of belittling people just to try and cause yourself
to appear as an angel?  You have a very sick mind and someday you will pay
the price...

*YOU* wrote the words above, dipshit. Had you supplied an URL to
something that i had written, then anybody could simply click on
it to read the actual material in context and checked the headers
for authentication verification.

Learn to copy and paste with a mouse. I hear its a much simpler
task than learning to read, but ask a group of pre-school children
for their opinion if you have any doubt.
