WATER EMERGENCY

CLARE PEDDIE, MICHAEL OWEN
October 13, 2007 12:00am

EMERGENCY plans have been prepared to supply Adelaide with spring
water for drinking as experts warn the drought is forcing us to
consider extreme measures.

Spring water suppliers yesterday said they had talks with SA Water
about the feasibility of delivering water in either bottles or tankers
to households if Adelaide's water crisis dramatically worsened.

SA Water last night said discussions with suppliers were held as part
of &quot;contingency planning&quot; in case mains water became undrinkable
because of poor quality.

Australian of the Year Tim Flannery, a climate change expert, said
Adelaide was at a &quot;significant risk&quot; of a water crisis within the next
six to 12 months, because of salinity and toxic algal blooms in the
River Murray.
ETC

* Yes this is another typical Antipodean pitiful joke put up by those
gutless australian Rags ( such as the WAR office or (West Australian
Rag )... I would be shamed to be called as such and would not were to
hide after such dishonour !

Oil allowed city planners to think wide and expansive, now
with oil reaching a critical turning point its nowonder those
settlements in the most extreme places are the first to hurt.
I suppose we should thank global warming for bring ing forward
the day Australians need to revisit their whole way of life,
atleast we haven't entered the final days of demand outstripping
supply. But whats the chance Australia resource companies
stifle any real debate about that hey! Australian maybe very
free, but their government is an authoritarian closed shop.
The only Conservation taking place in Australia is all
about keeping their fat hairy behinds on their leather seats
and the aboriginals safely out of minds eye (only to wheel
out when they need to cleanese the body politic, look we're
still trying). I mean what sort of political comment allows the
man that stacked the Republician debate and so stuff any
chance of change, to now suggest he can be trusted to reconciliation
with the aboriginals. I mean look at his record, when
change is offered, debate suggested, nothing changes.
So why would on Howards past record we expect any difference?

And to think Australia's young sons died to protect France during the
