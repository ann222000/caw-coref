Roger,

The bridges and wires are all 21-23 meters and the shallowest part of the
trip is the very end from about Grimross Island to Fredericton and you still
have 3-4 meters up there.

Thanks.

This looks like a great trip,  modest distance but international voyage,
beautiful river, a goal at the end (Harvest Blues and Jazz Festival), a
place not many sailors go, the best parts of the coast of Maine along the
way, the Bay of Fundy (Anyone know the Gordon Bok song?), what more could
you ask?

International voyages have their own special challenges these days as
you probably know.   You will definitely want to study the procedures
and requirements for clearing back into the states so that you can
avoid unnecessary hassels like leaving your boat behind while you rent
a car and report to the nearest immigration point.

Dear Roger ... there is one big huge problem with your cruise ..............
FOG!

It may be a beautiful coastline, but you won't see any of it.  There is a
reason "not many sailors go".

It you are planning on late summer or early fall .. maybe.

That is the perfect time !!!   You should have the best cruise ever!

About all you will deal with is the shorter daylight.

Might be a little cold at night ................   ooops,, I forgot ..
never mind.

When will you push off from the coast of Maine?  Are you planning on a
direct cruise?  Tell us of your itinerary.

This sounds like a great trip!

Got me so interested since I've visited NB so many times, but never by boat.
I found a web page:
http://new-brunswick.net/new-brunswick/rivers/sjriver1.html

Has all kinds of info..

There is very little chance of fog in the bay at that time of year.  I also
find the customs office in Eastport Maine to be very friendly and
accomodating.  One of the biggest challenges for a US boat is the reversing
falls in Saint John NB.  You have to remember that there is a 1hr time
difference between Maine &amp; New Brunswick and you have only 20min on each
tide to make the passage.  There are usually other boats around waiting and
Fundy Traffic on VHF 12 will give you the exact local time.  You should
check with Fundy Traffic when entering the Grand Manan channel on channel 14
and then again on channel 12 when entering Saint John harbour.  Please
notify the Fredericton Yacht Club www.fyc.ca if you plan to make the trip
and we will make sure you are well looked after

No, we are just nice people and like to promote the river.  Bring some
friends and I will take you around to the festival and spring for a a few
"beverage" tickets.

Roger ,, you seem to be hitting all my question marks today..

How does one Yacht Club know whether a visiting yacht is a member of another
yacht club?

Is the Yacht Flag ,, pennant the only identifier?

I was a member of a yacht club years ago that had no yacht clubhouse, no
nothing.  It was a joke.

As of today I am not a member of any club.  I have considered joining the
local club nearby but then they told me of the
club dues and I baulked.  They offer nothing.  No dock, no mooring, no
nothing.  Oh, .. the member who asked me to
join me told me "it is a great bunch of folks".

My answer ... So?

With my new/old/hardly works sewing machine ... I may do a little yacht club
creation.

What should I call my Virtual Yacht Club?

The name must impressive enough to fool the rich blue noses yet modest
enough not to scare off the working class hero's I
am more comfortable with.

Some of the names I've come up with ... ::

"The No Mooring Yacht Club"
"The Bisquits and Gravy Yacht Club".

Roger,

We have done customs in Eastport as well as Bar Harbor. Eastport is easier,
just tie up to the town landing north of the large ship pier and walk up the
street to Main Street. Turn left and the customs house is on your right.
Nice guys.

In Bar Harbor we called on VHF to the customs guys at the Cat terminal and
asked where they could check us. We were headed for Bar Harbor anyway so
they said that we could tie up at one of the local piers and they would come
to us.

Going into Canada we called 1-800-CANPASS and did our check in by phone,
once at Great Manan and once in Yarmouth NS.

Please be advised it is the Saint John River in New Brunswick. There
are other near namesakes (St. John's River, etc.) spread between New
Found Land, and Florida.

Several major features of this river have not been mentioned:  Grand
Lake and Washdemoak Lake being two, each of which is worthy of a week
of exploration and fishing, etc. The reversing falls are so unique
that I am surprised they don't constitute more of an attraction.

The harbour in St. John, outside the falls, with it's public dock and
walking access to the farmer's market are another, while the river
itself is delightfully tranquil and picturesque and has many public
docks between it's mouth and Fredericton. Gagetown is also a popular
arts colony, with all the comforts any sailor might require, including
a delightful pub, the Old Boot, next to the docks.

Many of the Marble Head to Halifax race crowd make an annual side trip
to Grand lake's Douglas Harbour every year, for good reason.

I have sailed hereabouts for over 10 years. My boat has a mooring in
Evandale, in my cottage's front yard. Watch out for cable ferries,
hail on 16, and pass behind.

Ferries that run along an underwater cable. Especially used where the
ferry crosses a river with strong currents.

&gt;&gt; a delightful pub, the Old Boot, next to the docks.

&gt;&gt; Many of the Marble Head to Halifax race crowd make an annual side trip
&gt;&gt; to Grand lake's Douglas Harbour every year, for good reason.

&gt;&gt; I have sailed hereabouts for over 10 years. My boat has a mooring in
&gt;&gt; Evandale, in my cottage's front yard. Watch out for cable ferries,
&gt;&gt; hail on 16, and pass behind.

The trip that Roger wants to do sure has its obstacles.  First, the highest
tides in the world.  Then, a reversing waterfall that has a twenty minute
window which a boat can go under a bridge and get up river.  Then,,,
underwater cables?

I also did a search of the river and it is about 90 miles from St John to
Fredericton.  That is a significant trip up and back.

If it were me?  I'd sail to St John, take a bus/car/etc to Fredericton,
watch the festival, have a couple of days to roam, and then go back and get
my boat in St John.

Then, sail to Nova Scotia, and then back to Maine.  You still get the
international in your itinerary, without the reversing falls, underwater
cables, and 180 mile trip up and down a river.

Just my thoughts.

Hey ,, just my opinion .. you didn't have to get all Roger on me.

I hope you don't end up like "Skip".

I don't want to read "boat caught in reversing falls" in the Portland Press.

I am getting my cruising plans set for the summer just like you.  Off to
Buzzards Bay, Cape Cod.  Why?  Because I am offered a
free mooring down there and if I show up I can participate in a Nantucket
trip inwhich I get a free mooring at Nantucket.

How can ya beat that?

After all this,, back to NH and off to Maine.

So.. take that you "old pirate lover".

I've been through hairer place than that:

http://home.maine.rr.com/bmssez/06C8.htm

and not to mention many passages through the infamous Woods Hole, my old
front yard.  I remember getting into the channel just as a tug and barge
coming down current the other way hit some eddy and the barge swung out to
one side taking up most of the channel.  I eased over into a cove in the
rocks and let the main out so that the speed dropped to just match the
current.  We held position over the ground, still making impressive speed
through the water,  with the rocks close ahead, astern, and along side.  The
tug boat swept by gunning it's engines and blowing clouds of black smoke
attempting to get the barge back in line as I juggled sail trim and rudder.
The beautiful woman who was with me said, "I am very impressed."   A year or
two later though, she married the tugboat captain, evidence perhaps that
size (of boats) does matter.  I've always felt that it isn't what you have
but what you do with it and how that matters but it didn't do the trick this
time.

Free mooring in Nantucket eh?  Clearly you are pleasanter to some people
than many of your posts here would indicate.

Sailors know that the journey is the goal. Spending 2 weeks going up,
festivalling for 4-5 days, then sailing down in the fall colours is
worth the time.  Bring a camera.

I use a cable ferry to get to my mooring.  Steel clothesline lets me
find the mooring every spring, and dragging the float out to the
mooring is a snap.

Terry K ,, at the schedule you just posted;  the trip to Fredericton and
back to St John is a one month journey.

Does it take two weeks to get from St John to Fredericton?  I looked on
google and it is about 90 miles from St John to Fredericton.

I would think;  60*D=S*T
60*90=5*T
should take :  18 hours

60*90=5400
divided by 5kts per hour

equal =  1080 minutes
equal 1080 divide by 60 =  18 hours of cruising at 5 kts per hour

18 divide by 6 hours per day =  3 days

Am I missing something?  I would think Roger would be able to get to
Fredericton in 3 days, spend 3 days at the festival and then 3-4 days return
to St John.

The whole trip would be less than two weeks.

Is that what you are saying?

Kts per hour???  are you talking about acceleration?

And why are you terrified of underwater cables?  Do you imagine that
they are trip wires that the locals pull taut whenever a foreign boat
goes by?  As for the Reversing Falls, that's always been a goal of
mine.  I don't think we'll get there this year, but maybe in a few.

The Journey IS the destination.  Or, hurry.  Take a week, take three
weeks. Fly, why bother with boats?  Sheesh.

Shucks, wait for good sledding and you could sail there on the ice in
about two hours on a real good day. 'Course, by then the leaves are
all gone. When you come to the year round cable ferry crossings, just
sail to the ferry dock and carry the iceboat around the water ditch in
the ice.

Or just stay home and drink.

Woops... the gears just started meshing... I remembered the big church on

You twice mentioned them as reasons not cruise one of the most

Cable ferries were once quite common, but now there are not too many
still operating.  Cables in general, are of course, quite common.

And I may be wrong, but the river up to Fredericton looks more like 65
nm than 90.  In any case, its considered to be gorgeous cruising
grounds, the real reason to go to St. John.

Roger,

Have you seen the reversing falls?

I have not been through it in a boat but have eaten lunch at the
overlook restaurant a couple of times.

It is hard to compare locations from your photo but............from what
I can see, the photo you attached is mild compared to reversing falls.

Your decision one way or the other.  Best of luck.

&gt;&gt; I should have remembered the ferry at Little Narrows...we were there fall
&gt;&gt; of 2005.  Is it still running?

&gt; Woops... the gears just started meshing... I remembered the big church on
&gt; one side.  This was the ferry we took We avoided the Englishtown Ferry by
&gt; driving around the southern end of St. Ann's bay as we headed up to do the
&gt; Cabot Trail counterclockwise.

In Belize we went across a hand powered cable ferry to get from the main
road to Spanish Lookout.  Spanish Lookout is an area where a bunch of
Canadian Mennonites have settled and turned the countryside into highly
productive farmland.

The ferry can take 2 cars at a time, maybe three.  The time I was on it
we had 2 cars and two trucks (pick ups) with about half the Belizian
army on board.  They fit the extra vehicles by parking on the ramps
overhanging the ferry.  One old guy winching away on a big old wheel.
First over,then back. All day long.

I couldn't get a picture because of my wife screaming about death and
retribution the whole way.  Life in the other lane!

You are quite right.  The photo, like most photos of rough water, doesn't
begin to do it justice.  The picture was actually taken looking towards the
difficult part.

Take a look at this chart section:

http://home.maine.rr.com/rlma/HellGate.jpg

You would have a hard time turning a 30 foot boat around at slack water in
the narrow part to the left of the 10.  Note the rocks indicated on the
bottom over which the current runs at 4 - 5 knots.  This is only the Upper
Hell Gate.  The lower one often has a visible drop of a several feet similar
to the reversing falls but only in one direction.

The bridge clearances and water depths for the St. John are suitable for
larger vessels than could ever get through the Hell Gates so I can't imagine
the reversing falls are too tight.

Not many sailboats go through the Hell Gates.  I did extensive planning to
be sure of doing it at high slack water.  I still don't know how I managed
to hit it at maximum flow but I suspect the tide tables on the web site I
looked at use an algorithim that doesn't take the complex local differences
in channel water level into account.  I've since discovered that there are
some dedicated current prediction sites for this spot.

If you are ever in this part of Maine though, it is a passage not to be
missed.
