What the hell? This company renders crayon scribblings of toddlers
into some kind of abstract art? Why would you bother?

My impression was that they just put the scribblings into frames and charge
the yupbreeders a shitload of money for it. But maybe they do alter the
scribblings themselves somewhat. Stupid either way.

How can you possibly even *conceive* that Bratleigh's art is anything less
than the greatest masterpiece in the history of humanity?

Because breeding causes mental illness, that's why.

Off topic, but funny enough enough to make me laugh 'til I hurt (and I

Personal favorite from Maddox's site:

&quot;This was a Christmas gift from Kelly to her parents. Good job Kelly,
now pack up your shit and find a foster home. If my kids tried to pass
this off as a gift, they'd come home from school and find all their
shit outside in a box. What a lousy gift, seriously. You give them
video games and toys, and they give you some half-assed drawing with a
crooked tree. I wonder how much a gift like this would set someone
back. Five, maybe ten minutes to find a napkin and some markers? F&quot;

The &quot;hairy fire truck&quot; was a hoot too.....
