First of all I recently picked up a Girl Scout Hat and Scarf thing. I do not
know how to figure out the year on this. It is in great shape and has the
little medal thing on the hat. The inner lable is also present. How do I
identify the age on this? Also I have picked up several boy scout pins. Like
the one for traveling and so on. Now the car for the one on traveling looks
old, but again I have no knowledge of this sort of thing? How do I determine
the age on these pins? I have several of them as well as Badges too. Along with
this I also have some manuals. Which There is a Boy Scout Explorer Book from
the 50's and a Girl Scout Hand Guide from the 50's and a Girl Scout song book
and so on...what sort of value is held on these? And is there much demand in
value on early 80's guides and video tapes? I know I have a lot of questions,
but would be most appreciative if you could help me. If you can please email
me. Thank you very much.

DDITMTY has a bunch of Girl Scout &amp; Boy Scout items 90% of which do NOT
meet the 50 year r.a rule and wants values AND information.

I could give you what you need,BUT, I don't like you,therefore you'll
get squat from me... IMO
Try rec.collecting

"/> Its really sad losers like you ruin such a wonderful hobby by being rude and
crude. I come to this newsgroup when I am in need of help, but why even come to
a group that is full of rude, crude and ignorant users as yourself. I know you
are just fooling and trying to impress people with your desperate attempt at
humour. I read all of these postings about how not to post FS and WTB and
nothing that isnt at least 50 years old. But none of you know what this hobby
is. If I cant come in here and ask about Boy Scout items(Which is quite the
collectible now days?) then why come in here at all. I give up in believing
that there are some good users that know the hobby and respect the others in
this hobby. This group sucks and is very selfish in their ways only due to the
fact they have no other life than the internets companionship. Without it they
were just an antique dealer, with it they now have friends. A big sorry to
those left in this room who still hold respect for the hobby and its holders.
Thank you

Danny:

You have occasionally come here with good questions or information, but
most of your interests have been obviously off-topic, and you've been
rather obnoxious about it.

Some of us have been discussing creation of a new newsgroup for
discussion of collectible items which are less than 50 years old, since
the existing NGs for those items are either narrow in scope (militaria,
dolls, etc.) or marketplace groups (rec.collecting). If and when that
newsgroup is created, there will be an appropriate place for your
question to be asked and answered. Right now, unless there is an
appropriate scouting NG (Hint: check Deja News), there is no appropriate
discussion group for your question.

I don't think there is any significant support for dropping the 50-year
rule here, but there is support for creation of a new newsgroup for
newer items.

Anyone interested in creation of rec.collecting.misc.discuss (or
something like that) please contact me.

bent when called on it.

"/> Danny Boy- there are rules and there are reasons for them and most even follow
them. You're the exception. Yes, there's something that sucks here but it isn't
the group. Either follow the agreed upon protocol or move on to a group that
will appreciate your outbursts and hold your hand on pricing 1980's videos.
Given your obivious distain or maybe even hate for this group, why would you
ever bother to ask our opinion?

As you know there is a good side and a bad side no matter where you go.
Unfortunately, it is on this rec group also. If you take the time to
read down thru the postings and responses, you will notice some of the
bad responses. These people, we have noticed, usually do not know the
answers to your questions. If you take time to weed out the bad
responses, you will find people willing to help you out with a good
response. Hopefully, the bad ones will eventually be weeded out if
more responses are to the good. Good always wins in the end. As
for your Boy Scout and Girl Scout things, People collect everything, and
there will be someone looking for Scouting items. In my shop, I have a
1967 Boy Scout handbook for $6.00 and a 1950 Girl Scout handbook for
$7.00. If they dont sell for a while, they still look good in the
childrens area. You can even make a small grouping using Scouting
items , especially for Scout week. Hope this has been helpful to
you.....Rhonda

"/> Rhonda,
If you take the side of DDITMTY,sstorms and TSturdevan you will come out
once again on the shitty team..... IMO Good for you and your 1967
Scouting books ,but they don't belong in THIS ng. If you have particular
'bad people' in mind,spit out their names or shut up. If you're talking
about me then just piss off..... IMO
I haven't taken the time to post many answers lately because I've
been busy e-mailing over 160 clueless posters since April 2nd (you
included). Apparently you and Luke can't play well with other
children,SO, go to your rooms and DON'T make me come in there.

Hey Deja-Stupid, it's called quoting (or webtv quoting) and apparently
you are too new and stupid to know what it is OR to be allowed access to
newsgroups. This just has to be Luke &amp; Rhonda...... IMO
This clueless newbie probably doesn't realize that someone on a
computer (but not on a webtv) can compare the header from your post and
match it to our most recent clueless webtv posters (even though you may
create 5 bogus user names,the headers are traceable).

"/> Sorry, Lyke and Rhonda.
Once you've posted something like that, it's visible to the entire
world. Asking for forgiveness at the same time is much like
Charles Manson telling Sharon Tate he's sorry BEFORE he
does the crime.
