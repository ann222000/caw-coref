Three points of the compass my friend and I were considering for rides
today, despite the gale force winds, are now obscured by blinding dust and
smoke. The fourth point, West, is unavailable as I don't think the ST will
do well in the Pacific.

No riding today.  :-(

You're confused. The Pacific ocean is *south* of you, not west. You'd have to
ride up to Gaviota pass where Hwy 101 and the coast turns northward, for the
ocean to be to the west.

In many parts of California there are both logical and actual compasses.

In some locations, such as the central valley, this results from considering
the valley to run north and south when it is actually runs almost 45 degrees
counterclockwise of these directions.  Near the coast, logical west is
whatever direction is that which is to the nearest part of the Pacific ocean.
In the north, this effect is the result of heading almost due north when
travelling east on much of I-80.

The result is sometimes interestingly confused people.

Sorry. When I parked my bike this morning, the Pacific Ocean was to my
East, North, and West.  I could see smoke to the East, but it was
still good riding weather. I spent almost 3 hours in the water getting
a workout, instead of getting a closeup look-see at nasty brush fires.
The TV news just reported the fires are stoked by 7% humidity and
80mph winds. Not a pretty picture. Surf's good, though.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault

A rider I know bought two houses in Lake Hughes, CA and we rode out to look
at them. I asked why the heck he bought those two shacks.

He said that the San Andreas fault ran through there and when &quot;The Big One&quot;
hit, he would own beach front property. Lake Hughes and Lake Elizabeth are
actually water-filled ditches formed by the fault.

http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=181:1:10572580701280496910

Type in &quot;Lake Hughes&quot;, select &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles&quot; county and look
at the Google map. When you hit &quot;satellite view&quot; you can follow the San
Andreas
fault as far as you want.

The fault starts in the Pacific ocean at Point Reyes, north of San Francisco,
and I have crossed and recrossed the fault all the way down to Thousand Palms
Oasis near Palm Springs where scenes of the pharoahs daughter finding the
baby Moses in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; were filmed.

Wow, nice break! (And where are the &quot;Surfaris&quot; when you really need them?)

I once went down to Dana Point (to freedive, not to surf) and found *huge*
sets coming down from the north. They'd closed the pier because the waves
had punched a bunch of it's planks off from underneath!

There were maybe 200 surfers within sight, but only about six or eight of
'em ever went near the water.

And I didn't blame them one bit.

Not all whales are dolphins, but all dolphins are whales. Likewise, the SF

The name simply identifies a given portion of the ocean in particular, so as

Quite apt. But I feel compelled to point out that when it all gangs agley
surfers do *not* have a set of armored leathers and a Snell-approved helmet

Yeah. For me to burn, I figure ~1000 houses would have to burn first.
Not likely, but it sure could happen - which is really spooky.  The
fires have already cut us off from the East, and right now, the only
way in and out of San Diego is I5 on the coast. The Witch fire right
now is less than 5 miles from the beach, (having come more than 30
miles,) and when it crosses the I5, San Diego will be cut off by road
from the rest of the country. That was pretty inconceivable up until a
couple of days ago. More than 250,000 people have been evacuated from
their homes.

We live in strange times.

Ah, but neoprene works wonders protecting you from incidental bumps,
bruises and cuts.
I think it's a toss up, really. I've been in the hospital because of
motorcycles and surfing, with many more minor injuries due to surfing
than biking, but I've never spent the night in a hospital from
surfing, yet I've spent two months in a hospital because of a bike
crash.
As for permanent injuries, I think the list is about equal -
surfing:
spinal stenosis
separated shoulder
broken foot bones

motorcycling:
torn knee ligaments
lacerated eyelid &amp; tear ducts
helmet wear causing hair loss

Save it. Nothing will hold back my verbal avalanche.

Authors write literature. Writers scribble.

So, what was up with all that description of the native plants while he was
trying scramble out of a desert canyon to avoid the fate of Everett Ruess?

Nobody thinks about botany in real time while trying to survive heat stroke.
That was when I realized Abbey was full of shit and was writing the same
thing over and over and over.

Abbey was an environmentally conscious Edgar Rice Burroughs, getting paid
maybe three cents a word (a penny adjusted for inflation) and he was his own
protagonist, too, a Tarzan without any apes to raise him, so he took matters
in his own hand.

Abbey flaunted his narcissism. What other author has ever admitted to
committing &quot;adultery&quot; with his hand, while left alone on a desert island?

Ah, well, getting published and getting paid for it means a scribbler
survives. Having Hollywood make a movie out of a potboiler proves he's a hack.

Of the three burning around my home in Santa Clarita, one was set by a
road construction crew, one was caused by downed power lines, and one is
being investigated as arson. we have had two smaller fires break out
over night that have been put out rather quickly. One started about
10:30 last night and burned a trailer park. It was about 10 acres. The
other started at about 4:30 this morning and burned about 12 acres. Far
too many to not be suspect.

Liberals would claim the fires are set by &quot;pyromaniacs&quot;, but some of
the fires are probably being caused by homeless Mexicans living in the
canyons.

Mexicans have to cook, yannow. They're not going to stop building
fires just because the Santa Ana winds are blowing.

The local Mexican camp is along the banks of a seasonal stream, and
they set it on fire every summer. The Mexican camps are quite close to
Mexican barrios, so you can't tell who is a legitimate resident of the
neighborhood and who's a vagrant.

When Griffith Park burned earlier this year, authorities never
mentioned all the homeless Mexicans camped in the park.

Property owners in San Diego county were trying to get the Mexicans
out of the canyons near their expensive homes last year and the
liberals claimed that it was somehow &quot;racist&quot; to want the vagrants
removed from their neighborhoods.

Besides living in the bushes and trashing the countryside, homeless
Mexican men and women prostitute themselves there.

The term &quot;Filthy Sanchez&quot; originated when American gays tried to &quot;hook
up&quot; with willing Mexican male prostitutes and discovered that a
Mexican vagrant was likely as not to shit all over his employer.

So the gays learned to digitally explore the Mexican's anus before
inserting their penis. If they encountered feces, they would wipe
their finger on the Mexican's upper lip, and that was called a &quot;Filthy
Sanchez&quot;.

I remember that fire well. We had another one just like it about six
years ago, across I-5 from Magic Mountain. What I believe was a hawk
decided he was hungry, picked up a snake and flew up to some high power
transmission lines. He landed in one power line and let the snake dangle
across another one of the lines. Both went up in flames, fell into the
brush under the power lines and started a small fire burning a couple of
acres.

Some are arson but when the humidity drops below 10%,
a lot of fires are caused by very minor events.
A few years back, there was one caused by a spark
from a grinder used by a fence installer.

They tell you that if you accidentally start a fire and you
haven't managed to extinguish it in the first minute,
you're probably not going to be able to and you should
get help immediately.

Power tools, power lines, smoking and cat converters are
a few of the culprits.

One of the things that really does happen though is
deliberate arson by whackos who get their jollies from
fires. Locally, I recall they had a string of five or six separate
fires all started within a few miles of each other along
the same road.

The guys camped out down by the creeks used to
generally be able to avoid setting their camps on
fire and usually picked spots that were sheltered from
the wind.
