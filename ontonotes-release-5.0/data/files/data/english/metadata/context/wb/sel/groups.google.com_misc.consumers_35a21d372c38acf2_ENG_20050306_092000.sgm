The first time I bought a car I ordered it with the options I wanted.
We agreed on the price and when the car arrived at the dealership I had
a cashiers check for the car.

The dealer had a rebate check that was issued from Ford with my name on
it. He asked me to sign the check and took put it in the cash drawer.

Nothing was ever mentioned in pricing the car about any rebate check.
I didn't say anything and I know I should have at least asked if that
money was from Ford to the dealer then why did they send it to him with
my name on it?

Thinking back I think that check should have been mine and I was
foolish enough to sign it over to the dealer.

I am planning to buy another new car soon and I dread the negotiating I
will have to do to buy one.

Any suggestions on how to get the best deal with poor negotiating
skills?

Any suggestions on a better group to ask these questions?

Perhaps more valuable: start going to yard sales and practice haggling
on stuff that you don't really want so that if your ridiculously low
offer price is refused you can walk away with your head held high.

When you can do this without excessive discomfort, try haggling for
something that you want A LITTLE and see how it goes. Remember, you can
always walk away and you'll never see these people again in your entire
life.

The secret of negotiating is to be able to walk away. It seems like
this shouldn't be difficult with a car -- it's not like they're
one-of-a-kind items.

I just got a quote on the car I plan to buy from one dealer that says
it is 300$ above invoice. Does that mean the dealership only makes
300$ on the car? He did say there was also a 250$ administrative fee.
The sales person seemed pretty honest to me. He gave me the figures
and his card and invited me back. I didn't feel pressured at all.

So the total markup is 550$?

"/> If you are a walk-in buyer who is either taking a car off
of the lot, or ordering one from the factory (ie, no car
searching, modifications, or dealer trades), you should be
able to get a deal for $100 over invoice. The $250 is just
a boat payment fee to help the dealer pay for their boat.
You can do better.

The invoice price is kind of a foo-foo number. Dealers
get other kick-backs, incentives, and items of value from
the factory for selling cars.

There are web sites out there that will give you the
invoice price. When I have bought cars from carsdirect.com,
I was able to get prices below invoice.

"/> Often the dealer will subtract the factory to buyer rebate from the
purchase price, and have you sign the form that lets the manufacturer
give the factory to buyer rebate directly to the dealer. Of course this
needs to be made perfectly clear during the negotiations, and in your
case it sounds like it wasn't. When dealers advertise in the newspaper,
they usually will show the final price that includes the factory to
buyer incentives built in.

"/> skills?

Look at prices on carsdirect.com. If no prices show up for your zip
code, try a zip code of a major metropolitan area near you. Last car I
bought (a Toyota), carsdirect.com was _far_ below the prices I was
getting at nearly every dealer. Most of the dealers were trying to add
on the bogus &quot;advertising fee,&quot; which was kind of funny since Toyota
had just gotten in a load of trouble for doing this. Just when I was
about to buy via carsdirect.com, one dealer had an &quot;all at this price&quot;
sale on the exact vehicle I wanted, and they were about $150 below the
carsdirect.com price. No attempt to add the bogus &quot;advertising fee&quot;
either. Carsdirect offered to match the dealer's price, but their
dealer didn't have the vehicle in stock, so I declined. I've heard some
negatives about actually purchasing via carsdirect.com, such as added
fees such as &quot;delivery fee&quot; and &quot;documentation fee.&quot;

Don't Negotiate Down from MSRP, or Up from Invoice
---------------------------------------------------------
Never bargain down from MSRP, or up from invoice (this is what the
dealers want you to do). Remember, &quot;invoice&quot; is _not_ the same as
dealer cost. Try to find the dealer cost, and make that your baseline.
It's often very difficult to find out what factory to dealer incentives
are in place (and they often vary by region); without knowing these,
you will never know the true dealer cost of the vehicle. There is no
single source to find out factory to dealer incentives. If you see an
&quot;all at this price&quot; sale (as opposed to &quot;one at this price,&quot;) and the
price is _way_ below invoice (as opposed to just a few hundred below
invoice), you can safely assume that there are factory to dealer
incentives in place. On unpopular models, the factory to dealer
incentives can be very high, sometimes more than $10,000 on unpopular
luxury cars that are way overpriced to begin with.

You should be able to get any &quot;normal&quot; vehicle for around 5% over
dealer cost (which ends up right around invoice, unless there are other
incentives). &quot;Normal&quot; means a vehicle that is not in very short supply,
i.e. Honda Odyssey, or the fad vehicle of the year (New Beetle, PT
Cruiser, Miata, etc.). If a dealer is advertising &quot;below invoice&quot; then
you know that their are factory to dealer incentives in place.

For example, look at carsdirect.com for a 2005 Camry LE, one of the
most popular U.S. passenger cars. In southern California, it sells for
$1600 under invoice ($1000 of which is a factory to customer rebate).
So there is probably a factory to dealer incentive in place, since even
when you calculate what the distributor pays in holdback, advertising
fee, and WFR, these amount to only another $900, only $300 over dealer
cost, which no dealer would accept (and they have to pay carsdirect.com
something too). Local dealers are even less for this model, some at
just under $16,000, so there must be at least a $500 factory to dealer
incentive in place.

Ad Fees
---------
Do not believe what Edmund's states about ad fees. Ad fees are an
attempt by the dealer to charge the customer for money the dealer pays
into cooperative advertising funds. The manufacturer subsidizes
advertising, with a per vehicle rebate to the dealer. Of course the
dealer is free to charge whatever they can get for a vehicle, and of
course they have to build _all_ of their costs into that price, but
they can't add on bogus fees and try to make them appear as
non-negotiable line items on the contract. The &quot;ad fee&quot; and &quot;doc fee&quot;
should not even be a concern, since whatever they add, you simply
deduct beforehand, and just let them add them back if they want. The
only legitimate &quot;fee&quot; is the destination charge, which is
non-negotiable.

Buying Services
----------------
There are some buying services offered by places like Costco and Sam's
Club, but I have found these prices to always be higher than
carsdirect.com. The only one that actually appears to be any good is
http://checkbook.org/auto/carbarg.cfm  but it isn't free (see the
testimonials at  http://checkbook.org/auto/cb-press.cfm ).

So the bottom line is that you should a) check carsdirect.com, and
perhaps consider the $190 for  http://checkbook.org/auto/carbarg.cfm  .

Lately, I've preferred waiting for &quot;all in stock at this price&quot; sales,
though I had a dealer try to renege on a deal when it was clear that we
weren't financing, buying an extended warranty, fabric guard,
undercoating, window etching, gold package, or any of the crap they try
to sell you in the finance office.

&gt;&gt;HIGHLY recommended.

&gt; Did they ever get their delivery process fixed?

&gt; The one time I tried to use that service, they sent the results to me
&gt; as a gigantic email file attachment, which of course never made it.
&gt; The guy didn't seem to think it was a problem worth fixing, and he
&gt; couldn't be bothered to, say, let customers download their report
&gt; files from his web site or anything like normal e-businesses do, so I
&gt; just got a refund.

&gt; That was a few years ago, however, so hopefully they've gotten a
&gt; little smarter since then. ;)

"/> Well, that sucks. When I bought it, I was having trouble with my ISP--I
couldn't download large attachments (they got sued over that, but that's
another story) so I got the fax instead. It was frigging huge alright, but
still useful. If I had tried to download this thing it would have crashed
my system for sure.

For example, when people used his system to buy a car, they would write back
with a purchase report. They'd say what make and model car they'd bought
where for what price, and how far over factory invoice they'd paid. Knowing
your car's (in my wife's case, a Grand Am) actual going rate and popularity
in your neighborhood and around the country was valuable info. FI and MSRP
comparisons are in monthly car buying magazines, sold on any bookstand.
They show FI in one column and MSRP right next to it.

At the time I used Fighting Chance, they charged something like $17 for the
fax, which I found out about by buying his book for like $15. It's gotta be
more now, but I'd pay double that, or more. Compare that to saving
thousands below whatever deal they offered me.

I spent a total of around $75 and 4.5 month's research on that purchase.
Lots of work, but it paid off in the end. Not just in saving money, but in
the sweet smell of smug that comes from turning the tables on the sales
hawks.

"/> You likely got a better deal than you would otherwise have gotten, but

The sales &quot;hawks&quot; don't care that they let a vehicle be sold for a
minimal profit, they want you out of there so they can spend their time
on the next guy.

The only time you know that you've turned the tables on them is when
they come up with a phoney excuse to renege on the whole deal, after
the contract has been signed, but then you don't end up with the
vehicle, so they still win.

I bought a vehicle in Southern California, at West Covina Toyota. It
was an &quot;All in Stock at this Price&quot; sale, so you'd think it'd be hassle
free, but it wasn't.

We agreed to the deal, which was way below invoice (due to factory to
dealer incentives), and signed the contract. When it became clear that
we were not financing, buying a warranty, or buying any other extras
like paint guard, fabric guard, gold package, digital ash trays, etc.,
the car suddenly became &quot;unavailable.&quot; The cock and bull story was that
they couldn't sell it to us because it had been damaged, then repaired
(hence the lack of visible damage), but it hadn't been &quot;cleared by
Toyota.&quot;

We went back the next day, got there before the dealer opened, and I
was talking to a guy setting up a BBQ lunch at the dealership. He knew
the dealership's owner personally, told me his name, about his family,
his previous dealership etc. When the salespeople arrived, I was
talking to them outside as they could not get into the building until
the dealer arrived. I explained that I was an old friend of the dealer
when he had his dealership across town, etc., all lies of course. So
when the dealer arrives one salesman tells the dealer that an old
customer is here and I say, &quot;g-d it's been a long time, how's the wife
and the family,&quot; and the dealer who doesn't know who the hell I am has
to pretend that he knows me, and my wife has to walk away to keep from
bursting out laughing. Fortunately no one recognized us from the day
before. We ended up getting the car at the advertised price, but we
financed it to make the dealer happy, then paid it off immediately.
Then the dealer starts sending us gifts so we'll fill out the Toyota
survey &quot;properly.&quot;

"/> Actually, you are wrong on that. It depends on the dealer, but most dealers
will NOT sell a vehicle at a &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot; profit. They would rather
have the vehicle sit on the lot an extra day or two until some sucker pays
them thousands of dollars more than what the vehicle is actually worth. I
know this for a fact, as I was told this by a regional (car) sales manager.

Several years ago, I did my research VERY carefully, and knew the exact
model of car I wanted to buy, and how much I should have to pay for it, to
the penny. I didn't need financing, it was going to be a cash sale. I
didn't have a car to trade, as I intended to keep my current car for a
while. It was a simple transaction, Car X for Y number of dollars. I went
to several dealers, all within a 2 hour drive of where I live. I made sure
they had the car I wanted with the options I wanted. I made my offer. Most
flatly refused to even consider it. One salesman wrote up the paperwork as
if the car was going to be sold, spent an hour or so going over details of
the sale, and then claimed that the sales manager rejected the sale. They
made a counter-offer for several hundred more than I was willing to pay. I
walked out, no sale.

I was just about ready to give up when I arrived at the SIXTH car dealer
(having had my offer rejected by five other dealers). I walked in, talked
to a very nice salesman. Told him I'd already been to several dealers and
had been rejected by all of them, but that I really WANTED to buy a car
TODAY. I explained that the car I wanted was on the lot, we walked over to
it so that he could see the one I wanted. I then told him how much I was
willing to pay for it. He said he'd gladly sell it to me, at the price I
wanted to pay. The catch? He was a regional sales manager FROM THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE COUNTRY who just happened to be at the dealership that day. He
couldn't sell me a car from the local lot, but if I paid to have an
identical one shipped from California . . .

Anyway, when I found out who he was, I asked him why I couldn't buy a car
from a local dealer. He informed me that my offer was fair, that HE would
have accepted it at his home dealership in California, but that some dealers
(apparently all in the New England area) would not sell a car for such a
small profit. So he CONFIRMED that car dealers are (on the whole) crooks
who will not sell a car unless they can RIP YOU OFF. A car won't be sold at
a &quot;profit&quot;, it will only be sold if the dealership makes a killing.

Later, I found a similar car (different make) selling for several thousands
under MSRP as it was a year-end leftover. So I ended up spending less than
I had planned to, but I did not get the car I really wanted, and there's no
doubt in my mind that I was still ripped off, even though I paid several
thousands below MSRP. -Dave

The owner of any business is entitled to sell his merchandise for whatever
price he wants to. If his price is higher than his competitors, he'll sell
less merchandise but that doesn't make him a 'ripoff artist'. A person
invests millions of dollars in a business, has a tremendous overhead and
decides for himself what the minimum profit is acceptable to him. You, as
the customer decide who gives you the better deal and value and purchase
from them.

&gt;&gt; You likely got a better deal than you would otherwise have gotten, but
&gt;&gt; if the dealer agreed to the deal, you didn't turn the tables on anyone.
&gt;&gt; The sales &quot;hawks&quot; don't care that they let a vehicle be sold for a
&gt;&gt; minimal profit, they want you out of there so they can spend their time
&gt;&gt; on the next guy.

&gt; Actually, you are wrong on that. It depends on the dealer, but most
&gt; dealers
&gt; will NOT sell a vehicle at a &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot; profit. They would
&gt; rather
&gt; have the vehicle sit on the lot an extra day or two until some sucker pays
&gt; them thousands of dollars more than what the vehicle is actually worth. I
&gt; know this for a fact, as I was told this by a regional (car) sales
&gt; manager.

"/>&lt;snipped for length&gt;

What a mess--6 dealers! They must have a low volume of sales, or are just
plain greedy. You did the right thing walking away.

I thought about how I might have handled it different, and came up with
these questions:

* Did you discuss price before deciding on the car with the hawk?

* Did you say you were buying with cash?

* Did you tell them that you really wanted that particular car?

* When they took an hour to go over the deal, where were you--in the room or
cooling your heels in a waiting room?

If you get the chance, Dave would you post an answer to these questions? I
have an idea or two as to what happened, but want to get more facts first.

Yes, I made it clear early on with all the dealers that I was paying CASH.
(well, personal check, but . . . )

Yes, I told all the dealers exactly which car I wanted. I didn't even
bother to talk to a salesperson before I verified that they had the exact
model/options/etc. on the lot for sale.

The dealer who wasted my time left me waiting for a while at the salesman's
desk. I almost walked out right before my offer was rejected and a
counter-offer made. I DID walk out immediately when I heard the
counter-offer.

I know I did everything right, as a regional sales manager CONFIRMED that I
did everything right. Bottom line, if you do your homework well, it is
practically impossible to buy a new car. Car dealers want NOTHING to do
with informed buyers. They'd rather sell a few cars at a *huge* profit than
even ONE at a small profit. -Dave

&gt; Dave, do people frequently tell you that you're an idiot? Because you

&gt; mean that you know what the dealer's FULL COST is. You don't run their
&gt; finances so you don't know how much they pay their employees, what the

I saw red flags on these points, Dave:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; * Did you say you were buying with cash?
&gt; Yes, I made it clear early on with all the dealers that I was paying CASH.
&gt; (well, personal check, but . . . )

"/> This pisses them off--it means they won't get extra on their commission by
selling you their money to buy your car. The way around this is when they
ask how you'll be paying for the car, put the brakes on that topic and say
you just want to talk about the car right now. Truth is, how you pay for
the car is none of their damn business, and they don't need to know at all
until you've agreed on a price.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> This pisses them off and helps them at the same time--they have to feel like
they have sold you a particular car. If you let them know that you want a
specific car up front, then they relax--all they have to do at that point is
wait you out. The way around this is, even if you see your car over there,
stay over here and mosey over there in your own sweet time, checking out a
few cars before and after. As far as you're concerned to them, a car is a
car--basic transportation. They don't need to know your dream car is
sitting right over there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Oldest trick in the book. They &quot;take the offer to their manager in the
back&quot;, but what they really do is go to the break room and watch the game
for a while. The manager never sees them unless he's watching the game too.

boss, look him dead in the eye and say, &quot;I'll wait 3 minutes for his answer
and then I'm leaving.&quot; Plain and simple. Then hit the timer on your watch
or note the time out loud. If he calls your bluff, then walk out. I'll bet
you tonight's gig money he'll chase you down.

NEVER tell the you are definitely buying a car today. They have to make (or
accept) an offer they can't refuse. If they balk, you can say, &quot;Geez, I
just thought I would buy a car today. Why won't you let me buy a car?&quot; For
some reason, that cools their jets right away.

I'm not wrong for California, I can't speak for other areas.

It depends on the car. When the dealer has an essentially unlimited
supply of a specific model, which is the case except for a very few
models, they don't have to save a car for the next guy, they have
another one to sell him tomorrow.

You're not going to get a good deal on Prius or an Odyssey, but you can
easily get one on a Camry or Accord. I'd be willing to wager that the
Camry and Accord have some of the greatest differences between what
different people pay for the identical vehicle.

But maybe this is only how it works in California, I have not bought a
car outside of California since 1979.

Everyone wants to believe that they got an incredible deal on a car,
and some get better deals than others, but it's the dealer that chooses
whether or not to agree to the price you offer.

The funniest thing to me is when I hear people swear that they must
have gotten a great deal because they paid x amount of dollars over or
under invoice. Anytime they reference &quot;invoice&quot; I know that they most
likely got taken to the cleaners.

Good questions.

I know that a lot of people mistakenly believe that the dealer is
thrilled to have cash buyers, and will lower the price based on this,
when exactly the opposite is true.

NEVER tell the dealer that you will be paying cash. Inquire about
financing. Inquire about the extended warranty, inquire about
undercoating, etc.

This depends on the dealer. I've certainly never come across a dealer
like this. They would of course rather sell every vehicle at a huge
margin, with financing, warranty, etc. But on the other hand, their
kickbacks from the manufacturer, and their allocation of high demand
vehicles, depends on their sales volume. So the Honda dealer is going
to sell a gazillion Civics and Accords, if he can, so he can get more
Odysseys and Pilots.

"/> In some cases, with the real dogs in a model line-up, yeah, the dealer
will sell for very little mark-up over their actual cost, which will be
way below invoice. They're paying the bank to finance their inventory,
so getting the junk off the lot has an upside.

For models that are in plentiful supply, but that still sell well, you'd
expect to pay a little below invoice (i.e. cars like Camry, Accord,
Altima, Corolla, Civic, etc.). There are very few vehicles where you'd
have to pay over invoice, i.e. Prius, Odyssey, Pilot.

how dealers could think that they'd get away with crap like that. I didn't
totally understand the answer, but it has to do with financing. Something
about when you trade a vehicle that's worth less than you owe on it, it's
easier to roll that upside down amount into a loan for a used vehicle, as
the vehicle condition can be fudged a bit. But with a new car loan, the
bank knows to the penny what the new car is worth, so there is less fudge
factor, and harder for some buyers to get financed. Thus, slightly used
cars are selling for more than new ones . . . or at least the asking price
is above MSRP. :) -Dave

itself is a bad idea), then buying used can save you a little money. But
some people don't trade a car every few years, and would rather NOT deal
with problems caused by someone else's negligence. So for some people, the
depreciation over the first year or two is the price that they'd gladly pay

The real answer is that it's morally wrong to allow a sucker to keep his
money.

The real question is what these used vehicles actually sell for most of
the time. Are they mostly being sold for the asking price or not? I've
inquired about a used Toyota, and the seller was absolutely convinced
that he would get more for his used vehicle than what local dealers were
selling them for new.

&gt; The invoice price is kind of a foo-foo number.

"/> I'd wager that most buyers believe that the invoice amount is what the
dealer pays the manufacturer for the vehicle. You'll see or hear endless
claims, on Usenet, at work, at parties, etc. that the buyer got some
incredible deal because they got the car for only a couple of hundred
over invoice, or at invoice. Sometimes there will be some story about
how it was the end-of-the-month, or the dealer was closing for the
night, or the Super Bowl was about to start, etc. Dealers encourage
these beliefs.

In my area, the invoice has become the de-factor retail price from which
to bargain down from, for buyers that do even just a tiny bit of
planning. If you do any research at all, you'll find that what you
really want to do is to find out the dealer cost, and base your offers
on that, rather than bargaining up or down from invoice.

I prepare a spreadsheet with MSRP, Invoice, Dealer Cost, all rebates,
incentives, etc., and based on the dealer cost, come up with a range of
what I'd pay (generally 2%-5% over the true dealer cost, which has
always been below invoice). But you NEVER go into the dealer with any
spreadsheets or printouts from the web, this makes you into an
attractive target for the ad fee, doc fee, or prep fee scams.

&gt; Dealers get other kick-backs, incentives, and items of value from

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the factory for selling cars.

"/> All of which need to be subtracted from the invoice price to get the
dealer cost, before adding on dealer profit to determine your offering
price.

"/> Not necessarily. You could make money by buying a new car at the low end
of the price range, and selling it used to a naive buyer for somewhere
between MSRP and what you paid.

Look at the Camry LE. It has an MSRP of $19,835, an invoice price of
$18,197, and can be purchased for $16,000 (carsdirect is $16,300, but
local dealers regularly sell them for $15,9xx. It is conceivable that
you could resell it at around the invoice price to someone that believes
that getting a car at invoice price is an amazing feat.

The sales tax would make this a tough way to make a living, but you
still be coming out ahead.

some excellent advice offered here of which you could take advantage at no

Some areas around the country have just a few dealers, and unless you want
to drive a hundred miles away you have to deal with them. In those cases
your options are limited. That said, you could still stay out of that 80%

They basically do not make any salaries, just commissions. That doesn't make
them thieves. Many years ago Oldsmobile decided to go with the 'one price
car'. They lowered the window price to a very small margin of profit for the
dealer. They figured many people were tired of haggling and if they knew
they can buy the car for a low price and the price was the same everywhere
they would be happy. Guess what? They still came in and tried to haggle the
price down causing Oldsmobile to abandon that policy. Everyone wants a
bargain but I'll bet you're the one that beats the salesman over the head
for the cheapest deal but when something goes wrong with the car you run
into the showroom and yell at him for not helping you out. You get what you
pay for. Remember, price doesn't make the best deal. Price and service
combined make the best deal and the best value.

"/> Some people take the whole car-buying experience much too personally.

The key to successful negotiations is to keep your cool, and be ready to
walk away.

Of course you don't want to make the common mistakes, such as telling
the dealer you'll be paying cash, telling the dealer that you've decided
on a specific model with specific options, and letting it be known up
front that you won't be purchasing an extended warranty, or any of the
dealer installed non-OEM options (for some makes, especially Honda, most
options are dealer installed, not factory installed).

A large part of the problem is that most dealers won't simply state the
price, they'll state an artificially low price, then try to add on a
bunch of bogus fees like the doc fee, advertising fee, or dealer prep
fee. Or in the case of Saturn, they'll claim a non-negotiable set price,
and still try to add on a bunch of bogus fees.

The &quot;one at this price&quot; ads contribute to the mistrust as well. Even the
&quot;six at this price&quot; ads usually have a catch, i.e. my relative was
buying an Accord SE, and there was a very low price advertised by a
local dealer, way below invoice. And all six of these vehicles were
actually on the lot---and they were all black. In a way, it was fair,
the dealers have trouble selling black cars in this area, so they'll let
them go for less. OTOH, they pay the same to the factory for black as
they do for grey, blue, etc.. Ended up paying $375 more for a silver,
negotiated down from the dealer's request of $750 more. Still well under
invoice, but not as good a deal as advertised in the newspaper. The most
amusing part of this transaction was the attempt by the finance person
to sell the Autonation extended warranty, which was both hundreds of
dollars more expensive, and which covered less, than the Honda extended
warranty (which was not purchased anyway).

&gt;&gt;&gt;lawnmowers are cheaper by a few thousand dollars :)

&gt;&gt;Yes, exactly. The fact you drive it to work makes no difference
&gt;&gt;(except you may need somebody to give you a ride to the car dealer).
&gt;&gt;So the price is higher. My Visa can handle it, can't yours?
&gt;&gt;(And selling the old one becomes the owner's problem, but why not?)

&gt; I wasn't clear--I mean that lawnmowers aren't allowed as transportation on
&gt; public ways.

"/> Not relevant to the process of buying one.

"/> The &quot;actual invoice&quot; is NOT what the dealer pays for the vehicle,

There can be literally thousands of dollars between dealer cost and
invoice (actually there are cases where it's over $10,000. It's all a
game to make people think that when they are able to purchase &quot;at
invoice&quot; (ar a couple of hundred over or under invoice) that they've
gotten some sort of a terrific deal that they can brag to their friends
about.

For example, let's look at the last Camry I purchased.

MSRP: $20728
Factory Invoice: $18531
We Paid: $16988

And this was not a price that was haggled down to, it was &quot;all in stock
at this price,&quot; and there were a LOT in stock (more than twenty). This
was not the end of the model year, and this was not on a model that was
not selling well.

$18,531 was NOT the dealer's cost. The dealer was getting a $1000
factory to dealer incentive, plus there was the holdback, the TDA
(money paid to the dealers by Toyota to pay for advertising), and WFR
(money paid to the dealer by Toyota to cover the financing of the
inventory). The net dealer cost appeared to be around $16,600. So for
$388 between dealer cost and the sales price, the dealer wasn't
covering his overhead, but he counted on selling financing, warranties,
and dealer installed options, where the big money is. This is why they
tried to renege on the deal, after the contract was signed, when we
didn't go for any of that stuff.

Don't think that the factory to dealer incentives are only for the
slowest selling models that nobody wants, or only happen at the end of
the model year. Companies like Toyota and Honda believe in keeping
their factories going at full capacity, and adjusting prices to
stimulate the demand necessary to not end up with unsold inventory.

In California anyway, the invoice price has become the de-facto price
to start negotiating down from, for all but the least knowledgable
buyers, unless the vehicle is one of the very, very few models that are
actually in short supply.

invoice, and after all incentives he netted $3000 for each one in his
pocket. The dealer was so happy with him he gave him a raise - to 50%
of net profit from 40%. The dealer still swore he made money by
selling the car under invoice and paying $3000 to the salesman.

Now he runs a group of dealerships in Indiana. It depends on the car,
but when he sells one at invoice, which is of course rare, he states
the dealer still makes from about $800 to a couple thousand on every
normal vehicle. Examples like above where the dealer gets additional
incentives from the manufacturer mean even more profit.

"/> I think you are referring to the Chevette - and $3,000 probably
represents about 75% of the original MSRP, so I'm inclined to believe
that your car salesman friend was pulling your leg.
