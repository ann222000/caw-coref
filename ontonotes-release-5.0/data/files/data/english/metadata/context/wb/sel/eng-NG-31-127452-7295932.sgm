Thai Govt Not Gullible To Believe Muslim Separatist
On October 11 2006

The new Thai Govt should not be gullible and take Bernama's report with a large
dose of skeptism. Â In my 3 years in Hat Yai, I have seen enough to be convinced
that unless these separatist agrees to cease any act of violence, their promises
or intentions will just remain as words only. ;-{

Separatists ready to drop demand for independence : Bernama

Separatist movements in the three southern provinces in Thailand have agreed to
drop their demand for independence in exchange for amnesty, better economy
development, more fund and usage of Malay language in schools, Malaysia's
state-run news agency said on Wednesday.

The Thai Government, however, wanted ceasefire and militants to hand over
weapons in the restive provinces where more than 1,700 had died since
separatists launched a campaign of bombings and shootings in January, 2004.

Bernama said the agreements were included in a draft of the Joint Peace and
Development Plan for South Thailand which was made following months of talks in
Langkawi and Putrajaya between the separatists and Thai Government
representatives.

Putrajaya-based Perdana Global Peace Organisation (PGPO), which is headed by
former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, brokered the talks
between the two sides following his visit to Bangkok late last year.

PGPO executive director Datuk Mukhriz Mahathir, who was involved in the talks,
said although the content of the draft was agreed by both sides during the
talks, the Thai Government has not responded yet, probably due to the political
situation in the country.

"We have played our part in getting both sides to talk. The draft is ready and
we have sent to them. In fact, the separatists have agreed to the content and is
ready to sign, we are just waiting for the Thai Government to give the
go-ahead," he said when contacted Tuesday.

Mukhriz said among those attended the talks were leaders of Bersatu, a coalition
of Muslim separatist organisations in the restive Southern Thailand consisting
BRN (National Revolutionary Front), PULO (Patani United Liberation
Organisation), BIPP (Patani Islamic Liberation Front) and GIMP (Muslim
Mujahideen Movement of Patani).

Some groups like Pulo emerged in the 1970s during the armed struggle by ethnic
Malays in the southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat seeking
independence from Thailand.

Bernama reported the Thai authority was represented by the then Armed Forces
Security Centre chief Lt-General Vaipot Srinual and General Winai Phattiyakul.

Following the military coup that brought down Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra's Government on Sept 19, Vaipot has been promoted as the new National
Intelligence Agency chief while Winai is now the Defence Ministry Permanent
Secretary.

Mukhriz said under the proposed deal, between four to five separatist leaders
would sign the agreement on behalf of the southern Malay people.

He said the Thai representatives wanted the separatists to hand over weapons
once an agreement was signed to ensure lasting peace.

"The separatist leaders agreed but with condition that all those blacklisted by
the authorities will be given amnesty," he said.
