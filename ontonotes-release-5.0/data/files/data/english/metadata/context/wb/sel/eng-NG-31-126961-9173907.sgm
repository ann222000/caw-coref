I have a vehicle I rarely use.  It's currently titled in my name,
registered in my name (in NM) and insured in my name (liability
only).

A friend would like to use it for a month or two and if she likes it,
she'll buy it.  If not, that's fine with me too.

I talked to my insurance co (Geico) and they said her being the
primary driver for that long is a violation of their terms and they
won't write her in as the primary driver since she's not a blood
relative.  And I wouldn't want the liability of it anyway.  They also
won't write a policy for someone who isn't the registrar of the
vehicle.

I'm trying to figure out my options.

Obviously I don't want to sign over the title.  Are there insurance
companies that will write policies for drivers that don't own the
vehicle?  What about registering the vehicle in her name but keeping
the title in mine, will that make it insurable and is that possible?

Any other options?

Thanks,
G

Entering into any &quot;try it and buy it if you like it&quot; arrangement with a
vehicle is a very slippery slope. I know you probably won't like this
answer... but I see only one option:

If your friend is going to drive your car for a month or two, she needs to
buy, register and insure the car in her name. A true arms-length sale is
your only guarantee that you won't be liable for tens of thousands of
dollars of damages if an unforeseen accident turns your good deed into a
nightmare.

Your friend must already like your car or she wouldn't even consider buying
it. Why not sell it to her and transfer it over to her, but offer to buy it
back if she doesn't want to keep it, (less the expenses incurred by you in
the original and subsequent transfers)? If you make her such an offer,
she'll need to trust that you'll honor it. If she won't show you that degree
of trust, I wouldn't find her worthy of your trust.

Take it from someone who loaned his sweetie enough money to buy a new car...
and then had to wait thirteen YEARS for her to completely pay it back,
despite a  written 36-month-loan agreement. Let your friend pay for the car,
etc. and get the complete transaction in writing. There is far too much at
risk for you to shoulder it all.

Tell her that due to insurance policies, she should first buy the car
outright from you. Then you will buy the car back if she does not want to
keep it. With the stipulation that any damage to the vehicle is her
responsibility before it is returned. She would then insure the car under
her own policy.

A two month trial period? Two days maybe, but not two months.
What she wants is a free ride. Like maybe her license has been suspended?
Or some other reason she wants a totally unknown car for? You do this,
don't be to surprised when the cops come knocking on your door and want to
know a lot of stuff about you and the car. I would not do it.

i agree with the others.  She's using you and it likely
will end badly for you -- anywhere from loss of your car
to lawsuit against you as the owner.

you don't mention how good a friend she is, but I can't
help but wonder if getting laid factors into this.  Don't
let the pussy cloud your judgment.
