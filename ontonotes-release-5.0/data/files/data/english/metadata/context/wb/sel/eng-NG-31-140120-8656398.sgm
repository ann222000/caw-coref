Reading the paper about last night game where Barry was doubled up off
his infield pop up, they describe an infield out situation, but no
infield fly rule was invoked.

WTH?

Description was man on first, Barry popped up and moseyed slowly up
towards first base. The &quot;heady&quot; shortstop let the ball fall, picked it
up, forcing the man at second and then threw Barry out at first.

Why wasn't this an infield fly? Or was the description totally wrong?
It has to be.

The infield fly rule pertains only when there is a force at third base
as well as second. When there's only a runner on first, the batter
should be able to &quot;beat out&quot; an intentionally dropped popup while the
defensive team gets the force play. Of course the batter has to leave
the batter's box in order to do that.

There's a 7-time MVP who was also confused about the application of that

He deserves every critisism for that. Suprised nobody's mentioned it.
That's just plain wrong. You know our pitcher griped if nobody else.

Bonds may be planning on returning next season, but I don't get the

forces the issue with management, this is most likely his last year in

This Sue Burns thing -- did you read that in Bruce Jenkins' column or
does it come from another source? It needs to be said that Jenkins was
also writing last year that the Giants wouldn't resign him for 2007.

I'm ready to say goodbye to Bonds too, by the way. If he wants to play
next year, let him DH just as Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron did. And
without him the Giants might finally figure out how inept the rest of
their offense really is. They might even figure out eventually that they
have no one in the front office who can evaluate hitters adequately.

There is also a rule about not letting a flyball in fair territory purposely
drop. I have seen the call made without rnnners on first and second.   You
can let a ball roll foul, you can purposely not catch a foul ball which
might allow a runner to tag up, but you cannot purposefully miss an infield
play, in order to get an extra out.

I've read it Jenkin's column as well as in a few others.  The 2007 re-
signing was mostly done out of neccessity due to the Giants' inability
to attract any high level talent (Soriano and others).  If the Giants
signed Soriano last year, it's a pretty safe bet that they wouldn't
have signed Barry.  My guess is that the Sabean contract doesn't bode
well for another year with Bonds, either.

There's no guarantees that he won't get signed, but I'd say the odds
are looking slim based on what I've been reading as of late.  His
defense and base running are quickly becoming big liabilities.  His
plate appearances have also taken a drop in the second half, and
figuring out how to manage his late inning replacement or off day
replacement seems to have taken up an extra pitching spot on the
roster.  Unless the Giants could pick up a top tier bat to put behind
Bonds in the offseason, I doubt the Giants brass will extend an offer
to Bonds unless it's in the sub $10 million range.

Their offense and front office are without a doubt inept.  Even part
time baseball enthusiasts can make that assessment.  They will have a
lot of extra cash in the offseason, however.  It'll be interesting to
see how well it's put to use.

Uh-huh. It really is time for him to move on to be a DH in the AL (if

Considering Bonds is a 7-time MVP and a 5-time Gold Glove winner and
probably one of the greatest players to ever play the game, I think he
plays the game just fine.

(Sure, occasionally he has a brain fart and makes a bone-headed mental
error, but so what!  Day in and day out over his career what other
player has performed better?)

It always amazes me how many so-called Giants fans nit-pick at the small
faults that Bonds has.  No one's perfect, but as a ballplayer, Barry
Bonds came closer than most.

Bonds' base running isn't a big liability; it even isn't a small
liability.  I've seen Bonds race around the bases enough this year to
realize he still has plenty of speed on the base paths.

But there's no escaping the fact, because of his lack of range, that
Bonds has become a significant liability on the field, and unless the
Giants obtain a gold-glove quality centerfielder during the off-season
-- a big if -- it would be hard to justify starting Bonds in left field.

Unless Bonds is willing to play first base (which in the past he has
declined to do so) it will be hard to find a position for Bonds to field
without creating a big hole in the Giants defense.

That said, the Giants need more bats, not less, and Bonds will probably
still be a very high quality slugger next year.  So the Giants have a
big problem this off-season.  Unless the Giants can find a real
replacement for the offense Barry provides, it would be hard for the
Giants to justify letting him go.

If the Giants were going to suck again next year, I would rather watch
the Giants suck with Barry Bonds on the team than without him.

Barry's definitely contributed a lot to this team; no one denies that
fact on this board.

Conversely, how can so many so-called Giants fans ignore the huge
faults that Bonds has as well.  Negative press, tossing his teammates
under the bus, playing the prima donna role, etc. Trying to equate
Giants fandom with that of Bonds is silly.  I don't think it's

I think some Giants fans do not truly appreciate how great Bonds has
been for the Giants.

And how many teammates has Bonds tossed under the bus?  Two, three,
four?  The only one I can think of is Mark Sweeney, and Bonds has denied
that he ever made those comments to the investigators about Sweeney
supplying him with the amphetamines.

And negative press -- how's that a major Barry fault?  I could care less
if he is nice to the press or not.

I'm not trying to equate Giants fandom with Bonds fandom, but that even
in his best years, far too many Giants &quot;fans&quot; were bitching about the
little things that Bonds did do wrong (like not running out ground
balls, not signing autographs, etc., etc.).  In a perfect world Bonds
would have run out hard every ground ball and pop up he hit, just like
Pete Rose and countless of others ballplayers did and still do.  And in
a perfect world he would never have pulled up lame when doing so, like
so many other players did.

But we don't live in a perfect baseball world, and Barry Bond's wasn't
(and still isn't) perfect.

But while I expect Giants and Bonds haters to point out every small flaw
of Bonds' game and make a big deal out of it, I expect true Giants fans
to acknowledge that Bonds, like everyone else, had and still has flaws
in his game (in fact a lot more flaws now).  But as Giants fans, I would
hope that they would see Bonds' flaws in their proper perspective, and
not make such a big deal out of the small flaws (like not running hard
to first base).

Right now Bonds has two major flaws -- he can't field his position (Left
Field) adequately, and his health, at age 43, has become quite fragile
to say the least.  The other flaws Bonds still exhibits are minor in
comparison and not worth dwelling own.

I saw the article in the Press-Democrat in which Bonds is quoted as
saying, &quot;I can play any position any time,&quot; by which he may or may not
have been indicating that he's willing to move to first base. However,
there's no indication so far that the Giants are willing to try that

the Giants are out of the race, for them to send him to the JT Snow

Bond has long had the well earned reputation for dogging it. I'd agree

I agree that it would be more in keeping with tradition for Bonds to
develop a style that looks less apparently sluggish, even if it isn't
actually faster. But since I can remember Bonds has declined to bust
down the line on every routine play to take advantage of possible
defensive lapses. There's a reasonable argument in support of that: the
few additional times a year he might reach base just aren't worth the
risk of losing him for 15 games or more because of an injury. Even now
he's too valuable to the offense for that risk to pay off reliably.
Looking back, it might have been better for his team if George Brett,
for example, had played &quot;all out&quot; a little less and was out of action a
lot less.

Regarding Bonds as an example for younger players, I haven't seen
evidence that other Giants think they can emulate Bonds' disdain for
traditional hustle. Frandsen is the only one I can think of who has cost
the Giants a few outs by not running when he should have, but those were
apparently cases of brainlock, not Bondsishness. Bondsism. Bondsheit.
Whatever.

Among the problems the Giants have that are larger than lack of hustle
are 1) outfielders who reach too few flyballs because they take poor
routes to them, 2) baserunners who take too few extra bases because they
have ancient catcher's legs, even though they seldom or never catch, and
3) other than the good young pitchers and Davis when he's getting on
base, being terminally boring regardless of their degree of effort.

But although I don't think Bonds is the chief cause of any of the
Giants' key problems, it's clear that he's not the solution to any of
them either. There is something appealing about letting him go and
declaring the start of a new era, even if the same old sheriff is still
in charge. At least he wouldn't be able to hide behind the lame excuse
anymore that he was compelled to sign only upside-free players while
Bonds was still on the roster.

If Bonds was thought of as a &quot;good guy&quot; with a good personality, people would
probably cut him more slack for his occasional lack of hustle. But since he is
considered a prima donna who thinks only of himself, lack of hustle only further
confirms people's thoughts about him. I'm not saying that's right or wrong -- it
just seems to be what's going on.

As for your other comments about his &quot;flaws&quot; off the field, I watch baseball to
be entertained so I don't care to a *certain* extent whether these players are
good role models or not. But when it comes to respect, I am even more likely to
give respect to an athlete for the type of person he is and what he does off the
field, rather than for what he does on the field. Regardless of any unfair
treatment Bonds may have received from the media, he has done things off the
field that irritate me. Missing team photos and refusing to sign autographs may
not seem like a big deal when other players are beating their wives and running
dog-fighting competitions, but IMO it *does* say something about this guy's
personality. These types of actions have shaped my personal feelings about Bonds
much more than his snubbing of the media, which (like you) I couldn't care less
about.

I don't think that just because he is the most dominant player of our era we
shouldn't be allowed to still analyze his flaws. And, I don't think analyzing
his flaws necessarily takes away from his incredible talent and his contribution
to baseball.

What rule is that? Many umpires will rule a catch if the ball lands in a
fielder's glove but he apparently lets it drop intentionally with the
intention of starting a DP, or even just to exchange runners at first.
But I don't think there's a rule in the book to stop a fielder from

I think this is the key statement. We can discuss the future of Bonds and the
Giants ad nauseum, but however this turns out I don't think it's going to have a
significant effect on the future of the franchise. Bonds is a short-term issue.
Sure, there is something symbolically freeing about letting Bonds move on and
announcing to the world that the Giants are moving forward into a new era. But
what good does that really do us in terms of having a better team in 3 or 4
years? I'm not convinced that Bonds' lack of hustle down the line is negatively
rubbing off on all our young players and creating a bad environment. And until
the team is exciting again, Bonds may be important to the franchise for any
revenue he continues to produce.

So I don't really have strong feelings one way or the other about Bonds' future.
I think the team has much greater issues to worry about right now.

Perhaps. Bochy took Bonds out of the first game in Atlanta in the bottom
of the 5th, not immediately after Bonds pursued McCann's drive to the
outfield with even less than his usual zeal, but after his next plate
appearance following McCann's double. Let's allow Hank to tell the tale:

There have been several recent instances of Bonds not
hustling, rankling some of his teammates. One can speculate
that Bochy yanked Bonds mid-game for not pursing the McCann
double, a la Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson, but Bochy
would not cop to it. Instead, Bochy said he removed Bonds
because of fatigue, and that Bonds told him he backed off
on the ball because he thought Dave Roberts would catch it.

And about the double play against the Brewers:

Bonds' homer, in the fourth, made it 9-6. Otherwise, he
had a rough night. He made a weak throw home and overran
a ball in Milwaukee's three-run first. He also let
shortstop J.J. Hardy humiliate him in the sixth. With
Randy Winn on first, Bonds hit a popup and did not hustle.
Hardy let the ball drop, grabbed it, stepped on second
and threw to first for a double play.

Bochy immediately pulled Bonds but said he planned to do
that anyway with a four-run lead. Bochy called it &quot;a smart
play on their part&quot; and said of Bonds, &quot;He learned. That's
why you go down the line. They caught him.&quot;

Of course Bruce Jenkins is more than happy to write that Bonds was
really benched for laziness, but if Bochy doesn't tell that to Bonds and
doesn't tell it to the media, what's the difference between taking him
out of those games and taking him out of any other? An inning or two
isn't much of a statement.

Well we don't really know what, if anything, he said to Bonds one way
or another. We do know that in the Atlanta game after he was benched
he looked mightily pissed off in the dugout. How many other games has
he been benched mid-game?

I don't read much Jenkins. The Sporting Green being the only thing
worthwhile in that poor shell of a newspaper (Or is he with still with
the Chron even?). I came to the conclusion on my lonesome, bad acting,
then benched equals Manager making statement (that statement stands on
it's own, Bochey doesn't need to go  to the press IMHO). Hey, I could

That was obviously an unusually early exit, but it was an unusual
situation. I heard somewhere that the Giants had suggested that he fly
directly from San Francisco to Atlanta, skipping the Monday doubleheader
in Pittsburgh entirely, but he offered to play in Pittsburgh to avoid
the negative press that would result if he didn't. So, after playing
more often than usual leading up to the home run record, and after the
trying travel schedule that followed, what Bochy actually said to the
media about taking him out early in Atlanta is plausible.

&gt;I agree that it would be more in keeping with
&gt;tradition for Bonds to develop a style that
&gt;looks less apparently sluggish, even if it isn't
&gt;actually faster. But since I can remember
&gt;Bonds has declined to bust down the line on
&gt;every routine play to take advantage of
&gt;possible defensive lapses. There's a
&gt;reasonable argument in support of that: the
&gt;few additional times a year he might reach
&gt;base just aren't worth the risk of losing him for
&gt;15 games or more because of an injury.
">

In the past, I have rarely been critical of Bonds for his lack of
hustle. That applies to both balls that he has hit while at bat and to
his defensive play in the outfield. And that is for just the exact
reason that you have stated here. But what happened last Friday night
was too egregious to let pass. He could almost -- *almost* -- have
walked to first base to prevent that DP. That was not lack of hustle.
That was flat-out dogging it. Not caring enough to do whatever he
personally could to help the team. And being too pissed off about
popping up. Further, this is not the first time I've seen him pull a
&quot;dogging it&quot; stunt such as this one this season. But this one bit him in
the ass, which he fully deserved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

True enough. But when plays such as the one last Friday night occur, I
believe it builds silent resentment within them. I mean, what can some
two-bit Giants nobody on their roster do? Go to Hank Schulman and say,
&quot;Bonds is a cancer on this team. He never hustles and won't do all he
can to try to help us win.&quot; Of course not. The only thing other Giants
players, the young and the old, can do is bite their tongues and say
nothing. Even Bochy, the manager, couches his words to the media about
Bonds &quot;dogging it&quot; very carefully, so as to not upset the applecart. And
he's supposed to be running this team -- on the field, anyway.

Yes, all is peace and love and harmony and good will and brotherhood in
the Giants dugout ..... My Left Foot!

Still, is there anyone in that clubhouse who can say that he's doing

&gt; Well, the way most of them have played this year, no, they can't say

&gt; So I don't really have strong feelings one way or the other about

I agree with all of this.  What they said last winter was correct: the
Giants absolutely should not build around Bonds.  That said, Bonds this
year was still an All Star level player despite his drawbacks in the
field and his limitations in innings played, and smart teams figure out
ways to benefit from their players' strengths...and, I think that Bonds
will still, next year, even without the record going on, bring in fans
that will help pay for his salary above and beyond how many wins he puts
on the board.  So money to pay him needn't come out of paying other
players.

He shouldn't block anyone.  Not a problem within the organization, but I
suppose it could be an issue with FAs or trades.  But if it's a question
of signing Bonds for ~$12M or letting Winn play, they're better off with
Bonds, as long as it doesn't &quot;force&quot; Sabean to do other stupid things.

Sure, that's all true. There do seem to be a handful of athletes who go out of
their way for the fans, and those guys will get positive press here and there,
not just from the media themselves but also from teammates. I imagine Bonds
isn't much different from the average athlete when it comes to dealing with
fans, but my cynical nature believes that most professional athletes are
ego-centric and don't appreciate the fans as much as they should, so I'm not
sure that's saying much. I don't think his behavior makes him a &quot;bad person&quot;,

One of the advantages the Giants have is that Bonds isn't going to
exactly have teams lining up to make offers.  There's no reason for the
Giants to hurry, at least not for on-field reasons.  Since it's also
likely to be a profitable one year deal, there's also no reason to set
aside money.  They can basically act as if they have a couple of solid
NRIs locked up, except once they fail to land anything good for LF, then
go ahead and sign Bonds for the $12M or $15M or whatever is pretty much
guaranteed to break even.

I agree with those who don't see it happening, though.  I think Sabean
has decided to scapegoat Bonds for the last three years, even though it
makes no sense at all, and part of that probably means letting him walk.

I just hope that Sabean isn't going to sign Sammy Sosa as a replacement.

Well, let's see what baseball-reference says. Sosa has played only 16

outfield in any season since 2004. He has appeared in 12 fewer games
than Bonds so far this year, and he has been significantly less

Oh, it's hardly a sure thing.  There's Aubrey Huff, Sexson, plenty of
other options.

The guy who seems very Sabean-friendly is Lowell.  He's having a
terrific year at age 33, after a horrible 2005 and a fairly bad 2006.
And, while it's a legit terrific year, it's going to look even better to
anyone looking at BA and RBI.  I could definitely see Sabean giving him
four years, $60M...he's of course highly unlikely to have another great
season.

&gt; anyone looking at BA and RBI.  I could definitely see Sabean giving him
&gt; four years, $60M...he's of course highly unlikely to have another great
&gt; season.

He didn't do anything against the Giants in the NLDS in 2003 -- he went
just 0 for 3 -- so maybe Sabean hasn't noticed him.

&gt;&gt;But although I don't think Bonds is the chief
&gt;&gt;cause of any of the Giants' key problems, it's
&gt;&gt;clear that he's not the solution to any of them
&gt;&gt;either. There is something appealing about
&gt;&gt;letting him go and declaring the start of a
&gt;&gt;new era, even if the same old sheriff is still in
&gt;&gt;charge. At least he wouldn't be able to hide
&gt;&gt;behind the lame excuse anymore that he
&gt;&gt;was compelled to sign only upside-free
&gt;&gt;players while Bonds was still on the roster.
&gt;Of course, if the only way to get the GM to
&gt;realize that the team isn't very good is to have
&gt;him get rid of the best player on the team,
&gt;then there's a very good chance that it's the
&gt;GM that's the problem.

Which, in turn, would mean that the team's *real* problem would be the
managing general partner, since he is the person who has just given a
two-year extension to this dubious GM.

&gt;I just hope that Sabean isn't going to sign

I'm going out on a limb here (and, hopefully, not sawing it off): even
Sabean isn't *that* dumb! Upon further review, it just occurred to me
that that was a sarcastic pronouncement not to be taken seriously.

&gt;&gt;Welcome to San Francisco, Sammy Sosa.
&gt;Oh, it's hardly a sure thing. There's Aubrey
&gt;Huff, Sexson, plenty of other options.
&gt;The guy who seems very Sabean-friendly is
&gt;Lowell. He's having a terrific year at age 33,
&gt;after a horrible 2005 and a fairly bad 2006.

Further, a Lowell signing would prove only that *nothing* has been
learned via the last 3-4 years of increasing Giants ineptitude and, from
my point of view, would doom the team to many more such years of
mediocrity (or less than mediocrity).
