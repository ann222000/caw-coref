Who would have thought UNC would go into the tank for
the last 15 minutes. How does a team go from playing
so well to being completely dominated. Georgetown
was just about on the brink (again), and suddenly
they turn it on and bring it home. I must confess
its nice to see it happen to an ACC team for a change.
Kind of ironic to see Kansas and UNC both go ice cold.
I was on pace to smash the record high score until
UNC lost. Some great final four matchups, can't wait.

Here are the top results for the fourth round:

84 points: Bob Buchner (3/4)
82 points: Greg Flint (3/4)
77 points: Andrew Murawa (4/4)
