A couple of nights ago, I caught a episode of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in which
Pat Robertson was going on about how a rocket fired from Gaza had
wounded 50 Israeli soldiers and Israel had done nothing in response,
which completely baffled him.
&quot;Is Israel just going to turn the other cheek?&quot; the &quot;Christian&quot;
evangelist wondered aloud.
Occasionally, you suspect that God Himself takes control of someone's
tongue, so everyone will know just who and what they are dealing with.
In this case, a pissed-off Israeli Rabbi.
One suspects that Pat (who didn't sound any too healthy in that report)
may soon be able to give us a on-the-spot report from the hot
place...unless he accepts the Prince Of Peace as his personal savior, of
course.
We must all pray for that, because there have been no Jews allowed in
heaven since 0 AD!
READ YOUR HOLY BIBLE-BOOK! IT'S ALL IN THERE! :-D

...Nothing. Ratsch is one of those pseudo &quot;Bibble thumpers&quot; who hides
his psychoses behind a combination Russian Phrase Book and Holy Bible,
and tries to pass them off as being from the Word of
God/Yahweh/Roddenberry himself. Truth be told, Benny Hinn's flatulence
has a googolplex more credibility.

The world would be a much better place if psychos like Ratsch were
rounded up and put out of our misery by any means necessary.
Preferably painful ones.

&quot;So, not to put too fine of a point on it, Venus is hot as hell.&quot;

Which would neatly explain the state of the world, as the substandard
ones would keep getting recycled while the good ones leave. In short,
the longer you go on the higher the proportion of screw-ups in the mix
gets. I think that actually figured into the Hindu concept of
reincarnation, and would eventually lead to everything getting whacked
by Shiva The Destroyer, and starting all over again.

&quot;The Naked Archaeologist&quot; had a very fun show about that in relation to
the Qumran (Dead Sea Scroll Community) remains...on the Sabbath, you
weren't allowed to travel more than a certain distance from the
community; and unfortunately, the distance required to reach the
latrines at their minimal prescribed distance was greater than that. So
that you  you fasted in preparation for the Sabbath, as you were not
going to be able to crap while it was going on.
And eating bats was right out.

Actually God doesn't say anything in the Bible; God talks to people and
you get their version of what God told them to say.
&quot;The Book Of God&quot; would have been most helpful, sort of like having the
Cliffs Notes on creation.
And I still think the poor Hoopoe is getting bad-mouthed in Leviticus:
http://www.birding.in/birds/Upupiformes/Upupidae/eurasian_hoopoe.htm
The bird spends its life destroying pests, and in exchange for its
efforts gets declared unclean.
I suspect that the writer of Leviticus was crapped on by a Hoopoe once
and decided to get even.
Either that,or he really liked Hoopoes, and decided to call them unclean
so that people wouldn't hunt them.
It's stuff like this &quot;The Book Of God&quot; could clear up. ;-)

...But Ratchet-head's blatherings are, in fact absolute proof that
reincarnation exists. It's obvious that his previous life was that of
a retarded baboon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

...And one of the more interesting theories is that the &quot;God&quot; of the
Old Testament and the &quot;God&quot; of the New Testament may, in fact, be two
different &quot;Gods&quot;, based on their almost opposite personalities. The
GOOT is a jealous, vengeful, arrogant, agressive deity much in the
same mold as the figureheads of the various polytheistic mythologies,
while the GONT is far more loving, forgiving, caring than the GOOT
could have ever been conceived as being capable of.

...Now, there's been a couple of interesting points made about this
theory that attempt to reconcile the two &quot;personalities&quot;. One point
states that the &quot;two&quot; Gods are the same, only that after Noah the GOOT
basically had an epiphany of his own and realized that His Mighty
Wrath could get carried away and vowed to just sit back and let
Mankind proceed without all the thunderbolts and fires on the
mountains. The problem was that didn't work out quite as well as he'd
hoped - read: Romans, Egyptians, Gauls - so he sends down a Messiah
who happens to be his son by some means still being debated today.
This Messiah is to spread the Word of God through a more subtle,
mortal method of delivery in hopes that Mankind will embrace the
messages through logical acceptance than out of fear. Good idea, but
as the Ghandi Counterthesis points out appealing to morality and
conscience only works when those you're trying to convert possess
both. Which is where the second point of order comes in: Jesus is
crucified, but the GONT doesn't blow Earth - or, at least the Roman
Empire - straight to Hell for having killed his son. Which, is
claimed, proof that God is truly merciful, having allowed the
creations that destroyed his offspring to live.

Now, be honest - if someone killed *your* kid, for whatever reason,
and you had ultimate power, what the fuck would *you* do?

(Note to self: lay off the vicodin before posting. Otherwise you'll
turn into Ratsch)

&gt; ...And one of the more interesting theories is that the &quot;God&quot; of the

&gt; could have ever been conceived as being capable of.

&gt; ...Now, there's been a couple of interesting points made about this
&gt; theory that attempt to reconcile the two &quot;personalities&quot;. One point
&gt; states that the &quot;two&quot; Gods are the same, only that after Noah the GOOT
&gt; basically had an epiphany of his own and realized that His Mighty
&gt; Wrath could get carried away and vowed to just sit back and let
&gt; Mankind proceed without all the thunderbolts and fires on the
&gt; mountains. The problem was that didn't work out quite as well as he'd
&gt; hoped - read: Romans, Egyptians, Gauls - so he sends down a Messiah
&gt; who happens to be his son by some means still being debated today.
&gt; This Messiah is to spread the Word of God through a more subtle,
&gt; mortal method of delivery in hopes that Mankind will embrace the
&gt; messages through logical acceptance than out of fear. Good idea, but
&gt; as the Ghandi Counterthesis points out appealing to morality and
&gt; conscience only works when those you're trying to convert possess
&gt; both. Which is where the second point of order comes in: Jesus is
&gt; crucified, but the GONT doesn't blow Earth - or, at least the Roman
&gt; Empire - straight to Hell for having killed his son. Which, is
&gt; claimed, proof that God is truly merciful, having allowed the
&gt; creations that destroyed his offspring to live.

&gt; Now, be honest - if someone killed *your* kid, for whatever reason,
&gt; and you had ultimate power, what the fuck would *you* do?

Actually in two different cultures; the Yahweh god of storms and
volcanoes* ran into the Allah god of the deserts as the nation of Israel
was being formed from different peoples, and that leads to the peculiar
behavior of God in the Old Testament; Sometimes He's mystical and
downright friendly...that's the Allah part; then He goes and starts
smiting things left and right, and that's the Yahweh part.
Since stories from both mythologies got fused into one storyline in the
Torah, He seems to have a wildly unpredictable nature, which adds a
nice, and indeed very human touch of depth to His character.

* This is fun; remember how in the Old Testament Moses leads the
Children of Israel out of Egypt, across the Reed Sea, and they start
following a pillar of cloud by day?:

and a pillar of fire by night?:
http://www.zen24203.zen.co.uk/surtsey/images/lightning_large.jpg
(That second photo may explain why Yahweh is both a storm and volcano god)
Then they eventually show up at Mt. Sinai which shakes like a furnace
and makes loud noises?

Remember how the snake gets cursed to crawl on its belly, leaving open
the question of how it got around before that?
Satan was supposed to be a Seraphim; divine creatures that serve as the
bearers of God's chariot...sometimes they are portrayed as winged bulls,
and inheritance from Assyrian mythology... but other times they are
portrayed as winged serpents, which may be a inheritance from Greek
mythology in which serpents are associated with Hermes and are
considered messengers of the gods:
http://www.answers.com/topic/caduceus?cat=health
In the Gnostic Heresy, the snake is the good guy in the Garden Of Eden
story, sent by God to tell Adam and Eve that they were created as
playthings of a cruel inferior god and his evil helpers, the Archons-
but that the true God wishes them to have knowledge and souls so they
can escape their Earthly mortal existence.
In Herodotus' &quot;History&quot;, winged serpents are described as flying into
Egypt every year from Arabia but being destroyed in vast numbers by Ibises:

&quot;There are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to
men, which are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of
the head: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to
this god they say that they are sacred.

(These are desert horned vipers; you think they are harmless, you are
making a big mistake - Pat)

&quot;There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against
the city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged
serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in
quantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number,
and there were heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large
and others smaller still than these, and these heaps were many in number.
&quot;This region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of
the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain,
which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the
beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt, and
the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance to this country and do
not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them.&quot;

No one knows what exactly to make of this story... Ibis do eat snakes
and snake eggs though.
Here we got the whole mess going on; a ibis, a winged serpent, a very
scared person, and a baby basilisk hatching.

didn't stick around...hey, if you'd just been crucified for bringing
messages of peace, love and understanding in place of a robber, thief
and revolutionary with several unpaid bar tabs, would *you* want to
stick around and give them a second try? The way I see it, he picked

lived the rest of his life as a carpenter.

of converts, but it's always easier to get more flies with sugar than

Hmm. Wonder what Ratsch does to celebrate Chrisnukkah?

Like say eating the body of your God every Sunday.
The nuns told us not to eat anything for an hour before we ate Jesus, as
he didn't want to be down there with a Hershey bar or something.
Also, chewing on the Eucharist was considered a no-no.
You used your tongue to stick it to the roof of your mouth and let it
dissolve.
There had better not be chewing gum up there either.
&quot;What's that in your mouth?&quot;
&quot;The Body of Christ.&quot;
&quot;The Body of Christ, eh? Well, I hope you brought enough for everybody!&quot;

...I recall the first time I got hit with that last question. I
responded quite clearly that:

a) I only had enough for myself.

b) I could not *afford* to buy &quot;enough for everybody&quot;.

c) I was not a charity organization.

and

d) Besides, I'd be damned if I was going to give anything to a group
if it meant giving to those within the group who I totally despised.

...Needless to say, the old luddite bitch I had for that second-grade

2) &quot;enough for everybody&quot; does *NOT* apply to cough drops.

You should have told her:
1.) The reason I have the cough drops is that I have a cold virus.
2.) Luckily, I did bring enough of the virus for everybody.
For added effect, change &quot;cold&quot; to &quot;ebola&quot;. :-)

[Cut to: Moses returning to Ramses regarding the final plague]

Moses: Ramses! Will you now let my people g...what is this?

[Uncle Tom is lying dead at Ramses' feet]

Ramses: It was your plague that killed him, Moses! For he was a first
born!

Moses: Impossible! His cabin was marked with the lamb's blood!

Ramses: Perhaps you used a goat by mistake. Either way, the slave who
helped raised both of us, who told us stories, showed us how to pick
cotton, to fry chicken, how to properly eat watermelon without choking
on the foul seeds, and above all else showed us how to make moonshine
whiskey, now lies dead because of you and your God!

Moses: No! It is you who have done this deed, Ramses! By failing to
heed the Word of God, you have caused not only the death of your own
son, but of a man who was like a second father to both of us!

Ramses: If your God is so powerful, have him resurrect Uncle Tom. If
he can do that, I will kneel before him and even forsake my own son!
But he cannot do that, can he? Just as I will not let the Hebrews go!

Moses: I have had all I can stand! I cannot stands no more!

[Moses' staff becomes a Darth Maul lightsaber as he does a Jedi leap
towards Ramses. Ramses, to Moses' surprise, blocks the blow with his
twin Scepters, which are both lightsabers with red blades!]

Ramses: You forget, Moses! I had the same teachers in the Force as you
did!

[The battle ensues for a good 30 minutes of screentime, stretching
from the royal palace to the Red Sea, with no quarter given nor any
ground gained by either. As the two duelers leave a wake of
destruction behind them - think Egypt looking like the refinery at the
end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; - they reach the Red Sea, which
mysteriously parts before them as they continue to battle from one
bank to the other]

Joshua: Now's our chance! Let's follow their wake and flee to safety!

Dathan: Right! And besides, I've got sheckels riding on Ramses, and I
want to see how this ends!

[The battle continues on down to Sinai, where the two battle their way
up the mountain, There is an active volcano at the top, natch.]

Ramses: We've been at this for days now, Moses! Surely you realize you
cannot beat me! In fact, now *I* have the high ground!

Moses: We were brothers once, Ramses! Don't force me to destroy you!

Ramses: Have at thee!

Gollum: HSSSSSS! Be sleepings here, my pretty-pretty and I be's! Quiet
down, you will!!

[Ramses does a Jedi double-flip as Moses swings with the intention of
cutting both of Ramses' legs off. However, he misjudges his arc and
hits the side of the mountain instead. The rockside explodes, sending
debris everywhere and knocking both unconcious. Ramses revives first,
and sees Moses lying next to the edge of the volcano about to fall
over.]

Ramses: I will leave you to your God, Moses. I will even leave your
Hebrews here, because I tire of them. I will strike their existence
from our records, so no Egyptian will ever know of this &quot;exodus&quot; of
yours. It'll be your word against ours, and who will believe the word
of a slave over that of a Pharoah? I would kick you over the side, but
you are not worthy of the effort. You couldn't even kill me when I
made a really stupid move!

[Ramses leaves Moses, who does in fact fall over into the volcano's
pit. However, instead of landing on lava, he lands on three large
stone tablets! Using his now broken lightstaff, he manages to paddle
to the edge of the pit and escape the lava]

Uncle Tom's Voice: Rememmer de Force, li'l Moze! Dem tablets, dey be's
important fo' yo' peoples! Better save all three of dem, because God
Allmighty done scribbled some writin's on'em y'all's needs t'be
readin!

[Moses saves two of the tablets, but the third sinks.]

Moses: Damn!

Uncle Tom's Voice: Oh well, two outta three ain't all dat bad!

Moses: Tom...I'm sorry I couldn't save you from Ramses...

Tom: Oh, don't worry yoself about dat, li'l Moze! It weren't Ramses
dat dids me in!

Moses: It wasn't?

Tom: Nope. Rememmer how yo mama, Bithia, kept on tellin' me that
moonshine I makes was gonna be de ends of me?

Moses: I told you that you weren't letting it age long enough, Tom.

Tom: Mebbe so, mebbe so. But never you mind, 'cause I'm in a better
place right now. But yo's best be getting back to yo peoples, because
Dathan's been selling what's left of my shine, and yo peoples is
getting really rowdy now!

[Meanwhile, back in the Hebrew camp]

Dathan: Ramses may have won, but you and I both know that somehow,
Moses will return soon. After all, Ramses never produced a body! But
when he does return, we'll have a surprise for him!

[Dathan opens a tent flap to reveal the Ark of the Covenant...which
looks just like the Death Star held between two angels' wings. Sorta
like the old Ka-Bala toy!]

Dathan: Yes, the ultimate weapon! We'll use it to destroy Egypt and
found a new Empire, with me as the Emperor! And if Moses stands in my
way, we'll use it to destroy him as well!

Tarkin: All it needs, my brother, is a power supply!

[Moses appears above the camp on a ledge]

Moses: My people! Here are the Words of God! His Laws, written by His
Finger, backed by His Power!

Dathan: Did he say &quot;power&quot;?

Tarkin: I believe he did.

In football there is a new rule where the defense can get a penalty

for the offense.

I understand your concern, Mr. Ratsch.  The prospect that billions of
people are going to first die (almost certainly in horrible suffering
from stroke, cancer, TB, famine, or some other &quot;Act of God&quot;), and then
be tortured eternally, is doubtlessly alarming.

That said, I'm glad you agree with me that this is not the proper
place to witness to anything (except perhaps the fallibility of NASA
and its Stick-shaped idols).  I believe there are several alt.religion
forums that would be glad to hear from you (or at least
interested...).  Perhaps you could try ministering to one or two of
those?

The same chapter of Leviticus, Lev. 11, also states that locusts,
crickets and grasshoppers have four feet.  According to the Book of
Exodus that immediately precedes Leviticus, God (or Moses on behalf of
God) had just sent the world's largest plague of locusts on Egypt,
where the Hebrews happened to reside at the time.

Surely God (or at least Moses on behalf of God) was familiar enough
with locusts to know they have six feet?
