From the September issue of CFO magazine (it might be on www.cfo.com , I
did not check).

A LTE from Carl Olson, Chair of Fund for Stockowner's Rights (woodlands,
california), on page 12 says in 2005 there were 1599 restatements of
financial statements, and in 2006, there were 1,876 restatements.

Things are getting worse.

A fairly large article, &quot;topline-Accounting, Mend the Gap&quot; starting on
page 16 reported on the first meeting of The Advisory Committee on
Improvements to Financial Reporting (big list of big names in sidebar)
said, among other things--

- &quot;10 percent of public corporations restated their financials in 2006&quot;

Another sidebar, on page 17 said these things:

&quot;Busted: Among the 1236 people convicted by the task force were: 214 CEOs
and presidents, 53 CFOs, 23 corporate attorneys, and 129 VPs.&quot; &quot;The
charges brought have included securities fraud, insider trading, market
manipulation, false statements, stock-option backdating, conspiracy, money
laundering, and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In
addition to the convictions, the task force noted, more than $1 billion in
forfeitures have been distributed to victims of corporate fraud.&quot;

It says if you want a complete list, go to www.cfo.com/convicted

And the point is?

I don't think being a CEO makes you a crook per se. There's a good bunch
of dishonest people at employee and mid-management level too. Of course,
the seriousness of the crimes an employee can commit is low in comparison
with guys who manage millions of dollars and make all the important
decisions.

Like politicians, CEOs and other high level executives are easy
targets for criticism.

A lot of people like to indulge in schadenfreude when politicians and/

&quot;cookie jar&quot;.  It's another form of entertainment, just to see high
level people fall back down to earth.

There are dishonest people everywhere. Now lets look at the ratio of
&quot;crooks&quot; (those who exploit, steal, etc) to non-crooks (i.e. honest
people who deal fairly) and ask if there are correlations between that
ratio and the sub-population under consideration.

I have made reference to a number of criminology textbooks which cite the
rich/powerful (or, shall we say, the &quot;pillars of the community&quot;) as being
a source for nearly as much crime as in all other sectors/populations put
together.

Then, we have my CEO-as-crook FAQ, reposted below, FYI, FWIW:
-----

FAQ #1: Are all CEOs (and their hangers-on) just a bunch of crooks?

The following represent a reference list of various &quot;quotes and sources&quot;
of information about executive and management mindsets and how the
priority is placed on benefits to the executives &amp; managers rather than
the company customers and any socially redeeming relationship to the local
community (however that may be defined).

FAQ #2: Isn't that question (above) a bit bigoted?
Yeah, and I have a similar bigoted attitude towards criminals--they should
all be in jail.

title:&quot;How Backdating Helped Executives Cut Their Taxes&quot;
subtitle: Evidence Suggests Recipients Of Some Stock-Option Grants
Manipulated Exercise Dates
by: Mark Maremont and Charles Forelle

quote from first two paragraphs:

&quot;New evidence suggests that corporate executives may have found another way
to manipulate their stock options, this time to cheat on their income
taxes.&quot;

&quot;In a paper that began circulating in recent days, a Securities and Exchange
Commission economist concludes there is strong statistical evidence that
executives manipulated the exercise dates of their options as part of a tax
dodge. And a review of corporate filings turns up some companies with
startling options-exercise patterns.&quot;

The article goes into substantial detail and is complicated.

WSJ, Nov 17, 2006, page A2:
&quot;Backdated Options Pad CEO Pay By Average of 10%&quot;
by John Hechinger

Quotes:

About 850 U.S. chief executives received backdated or otherwise manipulated
stock option grants that boosted their annual pay, on average, by at least
10%, according to a new study.

The study, released yesterday by professors at Harvard and Cornell
universities and the French business school Insead, bolsters the view of
federal prosecutors who have viewed stock-option backdating as means to
steal money from shareholders. Defenders of the companies who engaged in the
practice have said that backdating often involved minor sums and was merely
an alternative way of providing market-based pay.

The researchers also found that executives who reaped riches from backdating
options started out with reported compensation that was richer than their
peers at similar companies. On top of that above-average pay, executives
received an average of an extra $1.3 million to $1.7 million through each
manipulated grant, the academics found.

More than 130 companies are under federal investigation in the stock option
timing scandal, which has claimed the jobs of more than 50 executives and
directors. Five former executives face criminal charges.

Researchers examined the timing of stock option grants from 1996 through
2006, sifting through 19,036 grants made by about 6,000 companies led by a
total of 8,800 chief executives.

The professors found that 2,329, or 12%, were granted at monthly low
prices....

In all, 12% of all U.S. public firms, or 720, awarded one of more
manipulated grants....

The study also found that companies with long-serving CEOs and lacking a
majority of independent directors were more likely to make lucky grants.

title: &quot;How Backdating Is Like a 1980s 'Rockumentary'
By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.

While the main thrust of the article is to diminish the significance of
the expansion of the present options backdating scandal (mainly involving
CEOs and other executives in cushy, opulent, overpaid, overprotected,
and overpampered positions), the following quote gives additional evidence
that executives consider themselves a priviledged group deserving of
self-distributed benefits in any manner they can think of.

&quot;Some 100 companies are under investigation, and Iowa economist Erik Lie
says his data show that 2,200 firms 'engaged in backdating or similar
manipulation of grants to top executives at some point between 1996 and
2005'&quot;

title: &quot;Executive Pay: the 9/11 Factor&quot;
sidebar: &quot;In the wake of 9/11, about 90 big companies that didn't usually
grant stock options in September did so as their falling stocks made
options potentially more valuable for executives.&quot;
by Charles Forelle, James Bandler and Mark Maremont

Quote:

&quot;On Sept 21, 2001, rescuers dug through the smoldering remains of the
World Trade Center. Across the town, families buried tow firefighters
found a week earlier. At Fort Drum, on the edge of New York's Adirondacks,
soldiers readied for deployment halfway around the world.&quot;

&quot;Boards of directors of scores of American companies were also busy that
day. They handed out millions of bargain-priced stock options to their top
executives.&quot;

WSJ research on S&amp;P data on 1800 leading companies showed that 511 top
executives at 186 of these companies got stock option grants between Sept
17 and the end of the month of 2001.

Another quote:

&quot;Did companies take unseemly advantage of a national tragedy?&quot;

A full two thirds of page A4 is devoted to data, questions, and comments

announced it was ending pensions for 42,000 workers.&quot;

&quot;But there's a twist to the automaker's pension situation: The pension
plans for its rank and file US workers are overstuffed with cash,
containing about $9 billion more than is needed to meet their obligations
for years to come.&quot;

&quot;Another of GM's pension programs, however, saddles the company with a
liability of $1.4 billion. These pensions are for its executives.&quot;

&quot;This is the pension squeeze companies aren't talking about: Even as many
reduce, freeze or eliminate pensions for workers--complaining of the
costs--their executives are building up ever-bigger pensions, causing the
companies' financial obligations for them to balloon.&quot;

&quot;These liabilities are largely hiden, because corporations don't
distinguish them from overall pension obligations in their federal
financial filings.&quot;

The article goes on in great detail about the ultra-cushy deals executives
get at some of our largest corporations.

dodge. And a review of corporate filings turns up some companies with
startling options-exercise patterns.&quot;

&quot;Backdated Options Pad CEO Pay By Average of 10%&quot;
by John Hechinger

Quotes:

About 850 U.S. chief executives received backdated or otherwise manipulated
stock option grants that boosted their annual pay, on average, by at least
10%, according to a new study.

The study, released yesterday by professors at Harvard and Cornell
universities and the French business school Insead, bolsters the view of
federal prosecutors who have viewed stock-option backdating as means to
steal money from shareholders. Defenders of the companies who engaged in the
practice have said that backdating often involved minor sums and was merely
an alternative way of providing market-based pay.

The researchers also found that executives who reaped riches from backdating
options started out with reported compensation that was richer than their
peers at similar companies. On top of that above-average pay, executives
received an average of an extra $1.3 million to $1.7 million through each
manipulated grant, the academics found.

More than 130 companies are under federal investigation in the stock option
timing scandal, which has claimed the jobs of more than 50 executives and
directors. Five former executives face criminal charges.

Researchers examined the timing of stock option grants from 1996 through
2006, sifting through 19,036 grants made by about 6,000 companies led by a
total of 8,800 chief executives.

The professors found that 2,329, or 12%, were granted at monthly low
prices....

In all, 12% of all U.S. public firms, or 720, awarded one of more
manipulated grants....

The study also found that companies with long-serving CEOs and lacking a
majority of independent directors were more likely to make lucky grants.

title: &quot;How Backdating Is Like a 1980s 'Rockumentary'
By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.

While the main thrust of the article is to diminish the significance of
the expansion of the present options backdating scandal (mainly involving
CEOs and other executives in cushy, opulent, overpaid, overprotected,
and overpampered positions), the following quote gives additional evidence
that executives consider themselves a priviledged group deserving of
self-distributed benefits in any manner they can think of.

&quot;Some 100 companies are under investigation, and Iowa economist Erik Lie
says his data show that 2,200 firms 'engaged in backdating or similar
manipulation of grants to top executives at some point between 1996 and
2005'&quot;

title: &quot;Executive Pay: the 9/11 Factor&quot;
sidebar: &quot;In the wake of 9/11, about 90 big companies that didn't usually
grant stock options in September did so as their falling stocks made
options potentially more valuable for executives.&quot;
by Charles Forelle, James Bandler and Mark Maremont

Quote:

&quot;On Sept 21, 2001, rescuers dug through the smoldering remains of the
World Trade Center. Across the town, families buried tow firefighters
found a week earlier. At Fort Drum, on the edge of New York's Adirondacks,
soldiers readied for deployment halfway around the world.&quot;

&quot;Boards of directors of scores of American companies were also busy that
day. They handed out millions of bargain-priced stock options to their top
executives.&quot;

WSJ research on S&amp;P data on 1800 leading companies showed that 511 top
executives at 186 of these companies got stock option grants between Sept
17 and the end of the month of 2001.

Another quote:

&quot;Did companies take unseemly advantage of a national tragedy?&quot;

A full two thirds of page A4 is devoted to data, questions, and comments
from a number of companies that responded to questions, and companies that
did not respond to attempts to get comments.

title:&quot;As Workers Pensions Wither, Those for Executives Flourish&quot;
by Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis

quotes: &quot;To help explain its deep slump, [GM] often cites 'legacy costs.'
including pensions for its giant U.S. work force. In its latest annual

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
report, GM wrote: 'Our extensive pension and [post-employment] obligations
">

to retirees are a competitive disadvantage for us.' Early this year, GM
announced it was ending pensions for 42,000 workers.&quot;

&quot;But there's a twist to the automaker's pension situation: The pension
plans for its rank and file US workers are overstuffed with cash,
containing about $9 billion more than is needed to meet their obligations
for years to come.&quot;

&quot;Another of GM's pension programs, however, saddles the company with a
liability of $1.4 billion. These pensions are for its executives.&quot;

&quot;This is the pension squeeze companies aren't talking about: Even as many
reduce, freeze or eliminate pensions for workers--complaining of the
costs--their executives are building up ever-bigger pensions, causing the
companies' financial obligations for them to balloon.&quot;

&quot;These liabilities are largely hiden, because corporations don't
distinguish them from overall pension obligations in their federal
financial filings.&quot;

The article goes on in great detail about the ultra-cushy deals executives
get at some of our largest corporations.

title: &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Jobs?&quot;  (about Steve Jobs)
by Rich Karlgaard

some quotes:

&quot;But there is, always has been, a dark side to his genius. Once again we
see it. Angered out of scale by an unauthorized biography called 'iCon
Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business,' Mr. Jobs
went nuclear last week. He banished iCon from Apple stores. You might say,
fine, that is his prerogative. But is it wise? Apple's shareholders, not
its CEO, own the stores [my note: no they don't]. The harmless potboiler
would've driven buyers to Apple stores. Mr. Jobs, alas, didn't stop with
iCon. He also yanked from 'his' stores all books from iCon's publisher,
John Wiley &amp; Sons. These include dozens of popular nerd books, such as
'Macs for Dummies,' written to help Apple's customers. The dummy here is
Mr. Jobs.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Job's war on iCon follows another stupid public relations move born
of, well, totalitarian impulse. In January, Apple sued three bloggers for
publishing leaked information on Apple products. One is a young college
student who began writing Mac devotionals at age 13.&quot;

&quot;For all this, America loves Steve Jobs. Me, too, though I shouldn't.
Years ago, he phoned me on a Saturday morning and tried to squash a story
my then magazine, Upside, was about to print on NeXT, Inc. NeXT was his
second startup after apple. But it was failing and our story said so. One
the phone Mr. Jobs cooed and threatened, including warnings to 'watch my
backside' and, strangely, 'don't ride a bicycle alone on dark roads.' We
ran the story. Michael Moritz, before he was a venture capitalist funding
Yahoo adn Google, once covered Apple as a Time magazine reporter. Mr. Jobs
repeatedly tried to get him fired.&quot;

A lot do, a lot don't (according to at least one WSJ article), and I know
the record industry is very very very upset about this. And, they have
taken a good number (hundreds at least by now) to court.

But, the real damage is over in China (and India) where the piracy of any
media that exists is even more over-the-top.

I'll answer by saying that the guys who were all making a lot of money
made even more. The guys paying for it...maybe...got a little &quot;glow&quot; in

Im on the road these days, here is my two bits worth.    Society's
live and die on a natural and entirely predictable cycle as Ive been
posting... this one is on the last legs of its birth and boom cycle...
it is currently in the decay / rot and corruption phase and will die
out shortly... to be replaced by mulch, which will spawn a rebirth in
100 years or so... after this culture comes close to leveling living
standards with the third world.      there have been no exceptions yet
in world history.   Only those cultures younger that the cycles period
(520 years approx peak to peak) appear to be exceptions, and those
peaking again after a hundred years of so of starvation (such as
china).

The individual however can swim against that tide in any culture.. a
few strong and intelligent enough make it.. these spawn the advance of
mankind, which is fast in technical areas and glacially slow in others
related to the human condition (thats because of the egocentric
tendencies produced by a need to keep oneself fed and sheltered etc
with no other values)

any dilligence shown in opposing this tide personally is limitlessly
rewarding, but at very high short term and often material costs...but
then that matters only to a person intent on taking years to die
attached to a ventilator...those hoping to go out in a gun fight dont
have the problem.

there are two opposing perspectives at the root of these
confusions...what makes sense materially, that is the 'job', garnering
wealth etc..are all that are seen by a majority of people... for them
this is the gage of success and a goal... in the final stages of life
many of these can be seen fearing death, some terrified, and they dont
know why.

a best selling book on that range of issues by Dr M Scott Peck (MD)
addresses the larger issues in blood curdling fashion.   People of the
Lie.
