Hi all,

I picked up five Motorola Astro Spectra VHF mobile radios at a
Motorola employee auction here in Ft. Worth, Texas.  I guess they were
stuffed in the corner some where in the factory, because they're all
still in their boxes.  All have cables, speakers, microphones,
manuals, and of course the radio itself, model D04KKH9PW7AN (see
http://www.batlabs.com/astromob.html for what this means).  All but
one includes the trunnion mounting bracket.  They include options
G806AA (Astro Digital ?), G51AA (Enhanced Smartnet), W797AP
(Encryption DVP-?), W544AK (3 db Gain Antenna), G133AB, and G239AC
(internal options).

I've powered them all up and done some basic tests (buttons all work,
PTT seems to work, speaker works, etc...).  I don't have RSS or a RIB,
so I can't program them, but there's no reason why they shouldn't
work.

All are in new or like new condition: no scratches, plastic still
covering the display, most accessories still in bubble wrap or plastic
bags, etc....  The boxes are the original boxes, with serial and model
numbers matching the radios.

Is there any interest in these before I plop them on E-bay?  Previous
E-bay sales have these going for $400-$500 each, but usually in an
obviously used condition.

Email or call me at 817-231-7384.

Thanks,
Michael White
