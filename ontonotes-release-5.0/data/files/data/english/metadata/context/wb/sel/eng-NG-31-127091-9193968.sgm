A vent - to all of you who can appreciate where this CF punk rocker is
coming from - I'm thinking I need to find me more interesting
friends!

Within the past 6 months, within my little social circle:

- one new marriage with plans to breed
- one new marriage where one partner who already has grown kids wants
new baby
- one single friend who is moving in with old flame who has school
aged kids
- one divorced spouse with grown kid to move in with younger model
with school aged kids
- one couple planning marriage and kid within year
- one married couple who miscarried within first trimester planning
for another

Baby Dramas all around!  Wheeee!  Club me with a Boring Stick.

...and these are my so-called 'bohemian' and 'artistic' friends!  My
'conservative, 'square,' suburban friends are actually more fun to be
around these days.

It's crazy, crazy, crazy upside-down bizarro world.  Anyone else out
there currently experiencing these weird alternate universes?

T. - rest assured, I still hate hippies

Have I told you lately that I love you, Brother Pete?
My Pirates could go Hippie Hunting daily on your side of the country,
that's for sure!
Of course, it would be mighty hard to beat living around the corner
from the World Famous Fatt Matt's Rib Shack, but I'm guessing that the
seafood is TONS better over your way.

You're in ATL. There isn't that much water for things to be in, so it's
just that more potent.

I know, I just had to throw that in.

My condolences on exposure to bebbee dramas.

In my non-bohemian world, I've long since shunned (or been shunned) out
of various bebbee drama-prone social circles.

This past weekend, I blundered into the weird alternative universe of
po1son ivy. I'm coated with anti-itch stuff, gauze, disposable gloves,
and have had a week to catch up on my stack of amazon.com purchases.

Boring, but relaxing (other than the @#$%&amp; itching!).

...and for smartassed comment, my friend, the Pirate Queen bows
deeply.

For the record, I live intown in a tiny apartment, no lawn, and have
never washed my truck in the 10 years I've owned it.  My water bill's
always been low which is a good thing considering the various downtown
infrastructure weaknesses and water main breakages which regularly
give us rusty water.

Oh yeah, and I've never had insane laundry piles or dirty diapers to
contend with either.

I have to say that it's usually me that bows out when the drama gets
going. When I find out about a friend's pregnancy, it's usually:
&quot;Well, I'm happy for you if that's what you really want...see you in
10 years or so.&quot;  I'm pretty lucky.  None of my friends have ever
tried to convince me to join the Pod People even if they do, and I
don't get invited to Baby Showers - except at work by people I hardly
know (go figure).  You get respect when you expect it, I guess.  I
wish them well and then it's bye-bye.  Sometimes we may get together
for lunch or something, but I am up front about wanting to see THEM
and always ask if they've got a baby sitter lined up.

Still, when I see the upcoming dramas, it just sucks.  I just can't be
that supportive on the Baby Drama front. It's just not in me to care.
To be honest, I don't care about their Doggie Dramas or Money Dramas,
either.

Have your doc write you for some low-dose Prednisone. It's a miracle for
poison ivy. The only over-counter stuff I ever found helpful was Sarna
or anything with oatmeal in it, and that was only for light cases. I
used to get it like a truck tire ran over me. Now, if I get a light case
from my dogs' fur, I take 5mg of my dog's Prednisone, and that gets me
through the bad first few days.

I like hippies because the overpopulation movement reached it's peak
in the early 70's, the height of the hippie era.  I like punk rockers
too and in most cases punk rockers and hippies like each other as
fellow nonconformists.  Don't confuse a freindly rivalry with enmity.
The most substatial criticism I have heard from punkers of hippies is
that they conformed and tuned into yuppies, usually in cases where
they bred.

Okay.

I'm not talking about music - hell's bells, I LOVE Pink Floyd.
I'm talking about facism.

There is NOTHING worse than being told that we MUST get along, dig,
man?
Right on.

&quot;But even more contemptible than your tired old ass
are people who weren't even there who imitate your past.
I'm so fucking sick of hearing about your sixties.
You didn't change a goddamned thing, you stupid fucking hippies.&quot;

&gt; You might also like the site http://www.poison-ivy.org/ ;)

&gt; For example:

&gt; http://www.poison-ivy.org/html/berries2.htm

&gt;            &quot;Does poison ivy have berries?

&gt;            &quot;Yes, those round green things are the berries.

&gt;            &quot;Birds eat the berries without harm. NO, YOU CAN NOT EAT THE
&gt;            BERRIES!!! Geez, how dumb can you get? Somebody asked if people can
&gt;            eat them. Technically, there is not supposed to be any irritant in the
&gt;            berries, but why would you eat them?&quot;
">

And who would be eating berries in the wild unless they can identify
them? Cripes! I'll pick &amp; eat blueberries because I can identify
everything about the plant but that is it.

That is a wonderful website btw ( www.poison-ivy.org ). I bought a set of
those plant identifier cards from them, but it does no good unless I
staple them to me when I go out to do yard work. I cleared out a new
path in my woods a couple of weeks ago, and if I had tossed out my work
gloves after that task and bought a new pair, I'd be fine now.

Tecnu might help:

Basically, it chemically unlocks the urushiol molecules that have locked
onto/into your skin. It's best-used early on, but even later it can help
mitigate the rash somewhat.

Overrated. I mean, the food's OK, I guess, but the place is dominated by
college pukes....wait forever for a table, then attempt to converse over the
blasting music. And their hours are a little limited.

It's the same Jake &amp; Earl who ran the one in Inman Square, correct? I was in
the Waltham restaurant once...it was okay. But if you've *got* to eat at a
famblee-friendly BBQ restaurant, Firefly's in Marlboro has better food. I

Last time I was there was 2001, I think. The food was good, but not worth the

Hippies....and their children.

Seriously - there are plenty of urban hippies who like to be green and
wear tie-dye and never bathe and listen to the Dead and get back to
nature, etc., etc.  They think that they have outdoor survival skills
just because they camped out at a musical festival.

They were in force at this weekend's Echo Festival in Atlanta.

Honestly - I just love barbeque, but I'm not picky.  It's just a
waycool joint that hosts some awesome blues during the weekend and
they've got tasty BBQ at good prices.  They're neat folks over there.
There's also a Chicken Shack right next door where you can get chicken
or catfish.

Sure beats cooking it yourself!
