3) The person is then transmogrified into a "demon", without "free

Andrew Chung:

Is a frequent and proven liar (evidence archived forever on Google)

Has lost numerous NNTP accounts with supernews and others, has had many
Google accounts nuked, and his vanity domain heartmdphd.com is now
banned from setting up accounts. He is instead using multiple Google
sock accounts and email addresses in the format l ... @thetruth.com (#
being a number)

Is unemployed after being sacked with cause from his one and only job
after just over 80 days

Fled the state of Florida, and now claims to practice in Georgia despite
having no admission priveliges in the State's hospitals

Runs a phony foundation with a total declared income of circa $200, the
ownership and contact details of which are obfuscated on its website

Makes failed prophecies concerning earthquakes with areas and dates,
which don't happen (remember the bible quotes about false prophets)

Performed a public attempt at 'exorcising' a Malaysian sock on usenet,
then denied doing it. He has recently reversed position again and admits
to practicing exorcism by usenet, proving himself a liar in the process.

Promotes a dangerous diet, with a million dollar guarantee that he
demands thirty dollars to access details of. This despite being
unemployed. His soliciting and spamming for donations looks to be
similar to the Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud, where victims pay money
upfront in the hope of coming into money but find they have merely
bought into a lie. Part of his advice is to pour nail polish remover onto food.

Declares he has a cardiology practice despite posting night and day from
the same IP address (his home presumably) or a coffee shop internet cafe

Makes further false prophecies that we should now be all dying in a bird
flu pandemic. When these fail to happen, he does them all over again and
changes the dates. Nuclear war is another Chung spciality, which
naturally doesn't happen when he says it is going to.

Worships evil hatemonger Fred Phelps and will not denounce the acts of
Westboro's congregation. He even accuses someone with the name Phelps of
being Fred's son and refuses to accept he is completely wrong.

Uses the same patter as Pat Robertson, indicating his religious activity
is confined to watching cable TV. No evidence Chung has ever attended a
church.

Has a tendency to cyberstalk, particularly women. His wife fled some
time ago to another state, an act which Chung tries to pass of as "being
on vacation".

Frequently passes himself off as being qualified in areas such as
endocrinology, despite making incredibly funddamental blunders in his
'advice'. It is no wonder the Florida heart facility terminated him, and
has publicly denounced his version of events. Again archived on Google.

Don't forget the fake fast, where he didn't lose any weight, as well as
the infamous 666 stamping fiasco.

Give us a chance to evaluate your veracity.  Tell us your real name and
location, what you do for a living, if you have ever been arrested or charged
with any crimes, what areas of medicine you have competence in, are you married,
have you ever been divorced, have you ever been fired from a job, etc, etc.

You seem to want to pick at every detail of D. Chung's personal life.  You
should be willing to expose your own so we will be able to see your superior
moral standing.  Hiding behind a silly moniker is not a good starting point for
trust.

Sorry, but you do not get off that easily.  Your comments about Dr.  Chung
contaiin several things I know to be lies on their face.  So no, your chicken
shit hiding behind phony nicks, and sniping from under a rock does not suffice
at all.  You are lucky Andrew is a good Christian since you have clearly stepped
over the line and your published comments are actionable, but the worst he will
do is call you a demon.  You deserve much worse.

Andrew Chung:

Is a frequent and proven liar (evidence archived forever on Google)

Has lost numerous NNTP accounts with supernews and others, has had many
Google accounts nuked, and his vanity domain heartmdphd.com is now
banned from setting up accounts. He is instead using multiple Google
sock accounts and email addresses in the format l ... @thetruth.com (#
being a number)

Is unemployed after being sacked with cause from his one and only job
after just over 80 days

Fled the state of Florida, and now claims to practice in Georgia despite
having no admission priveliges in the State's hospitals

Runs a phony foundation with a total declared income of circa $200, the
ownership and contact details of which are obfuscated on its website

Makes failed prophecies concerning earthquakes with areas and dates,
which don't happen (remember the bible quotes about false prophets)

Performed a public attempt at 'exorcising' a Malaysian sock on usenet,
then denied doing it. He has recently reversed position again and admits
to practicing exorcism by usenet, proving himself a liar in the process.

Promotes a dangerous diet, with a million dollar guarantee that he
demands thirty dollars to access details of. This despite being
unemployed. His soliciting and spamming for donations looks to be
similar to the Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud, where victims pay money
upfront in the hope of coming into money but find they have merely
bought into a lie. Part of his advice is to pour nail polish remover
onto food.

Declares he has a cardiology practice despite posting night and day from
the same IP address (his home presumably) or a coffee shop internet cafe

Makes further false prophecies that we should now be all dying in a bird
flu pandemic. When these fail to happen, he does them all over again and
changes the dates. Nuclear war is another Chung spciality, which
naturally doesn't happen when he says it is going to.

Worships evil hatemonger Fred Phelps and will not denounce the acts of
Westboro's congregation. He even accuses someone with the name Phelps of
being Fred's son and refuses to accept he is completely wrong.

Uses the same patter as Pat Robertson, indicating his religious activity
is confined to watching cable TV. No evidence Chung has ever attended a
church.

Has a tendency to cyberstalk, particularly women. His wife fled some
time ago to another state, an act which Chung tries to pass of as "being
on vacation".

Frequently passes himself off as being qualified in areas such as
endocrinology, despite making incredibly funddamental blunders in his
'advice'. It is no wonder the Florida heart facility terminated him, and
has publicly denounced his version of events. Again archived on Google.

Don't forget the fake fast, where he didn't lose any weight, as well as
the infamous 666 stamping fiasco.

I've got evidence. Indeed, many if not most of Chung's postings here in
Usenet are evidence of the things I say in and of themselves.

His calling me a demon is certainly evidence of a considerably
disturbed mental state and his sermonising off-topic in support groups
where he has been told he is not welcome is the height of disrespect to
the point of contempt. It is absolutely clear that he has no concept of
other peoples' boundaries, space and personal rights.

Dear Syd,

It is the rebellion by satan and his demon minions that is the source
of all sickness here in this accursed world.  They thrive on hatred and
seek to drain all the love that you have in your heart thereby
destroying it and slaying your soul so that you will also become like
them, a demon.

Medically we call this the "broken heart syndrome."

What you see in me that "borders on saintly" is Christ's love in my
heart.  HIS love is ever regenerating and does not ever run out no
matter the efforts of demons to drain it.

Pardon the offtopicicity, but I am often amazed at the human
gullibility when say in Pakistan, an earthquake wipes out 100,000
villagers, and the able-bodoed survivors scrabble around for days
extracting bodies and occasional survivors, and when they come across
a still breathing victim, thay all dance around chanting that god is
great, which is praising the omnipotent, omniscient being who created
the bloody earthquake in the beginning, thus causing all their mayhem.
Now what sort of twisted logic is that?
Oh, don't tell me, I don't understand god's logic. Well, I would hope
not. You would need to be brainwashed and delusional for that.

&gt;&gt;spouts.

&gt;&gt;If I start spouting all sorts of nonsense about elephants in my front

&gt;&gt;credence to any medical advice I gave?     jack
&gt;You may not choose to believe in G-d.  You might well argue that believing in
&gt;G-d is completely irrational. But that dies not mean that Andrew's belief system
&gt;exhibits cognitive dissonance.  If you are going to use big words, you need to
&gt;use them correctly.
">

Well of course it does, but why display it here where he apparently
hopes rational people will take him seriously.

An apt quote from Wikipedia:

"The theory of cognitive dissonance was first proposed by the
psychologist Leon Festinger in 1956 after observing the
counterintuitive belief persistence of members of a UFO doomsday cult
and their increased proselytization after the leader's prophecy
failed. The failed message of earth's destruction, sent by aliens to a
woman in 1956, became a disconfirmed expectancy that increased
dissonance between cognitions, thereby causing most members of the
impromptu cult to lessen the dissonance by accepting a new prophecy;
that the aliens had instead spared the planet for their sake."

The point being that how can we be sure that Andrew has not changed
his advice from standard medical doctrine to that of his imagined
Lord?        jack

Pardon the offtopicicity, but I am often amazed at the human

villagers, and the able-bodoed survivors scrabble around for days
extracting bodies and occasional survivors, and when they come across
a still breathing victim, thay all dance around chanting that god is
great, which is praising the omnipotent, omniscient being who created
the bloody earthquake in the beginning, thus causing all their mayhem.
Now what sort of twisted logic is that?
Oh, don't tell me, I don't understand god's logic. Well, I would hope
not. You would need to be brainwashed and delusional for that.

is the Messiah, to do battle against a demon, which is a sock puppet of
satan, who is the source of all lies.

If you haven't personally seen him do these things then how do you know that
they are right?

Do you believe everything you read on a newsgroup?!?

There's nothing wrong with his diet.  I've lost 90 lbs. on a very simiilar
diet.

&gt; Why don't YOU make him stop?  You're the one bitching the loudest at the

It is a demon, a sock-puppet of satan, who has had all power and
authority stripped from him since our LORD Jesus Christ chose to suffer
terribly and die horribly on the cross in order to save us from our
deadly sins.  Many thanks, much praise, and all the glory to GOD for
HIS rising up on that fantastic third day.

Laus Deo ! !   Marana tha ! ! ! ! ! ! !

May GOD continue to heal our hearts with HIS living water curing our
diabetes, depression, anxiety, or panic so that we can love our
neighbors a little more and LORD Jesus Christ a whole lot more, dear
neighbor whom I love unconditionally.
