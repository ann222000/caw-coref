Mine safety agency under fire

By JENNIFER TALHELM

........................................................................... .........................

Mine Safety and Health Administration director Richard Stickler had
already come under fire for being slow to take public control of the
scene.

Even though Stickler's agency is supposed to be in charge, the mine's
colorful co-owner, Bob Murray, has dominated news conferences,
narrated video of rescue efforts for TV news and — despite safety
concerns — personally led reporters and family members on a tour of
his mine.

The fact that MSHA let anyone, including rescuers, into the
still-dangerous mine is raising new questions.

Others also predict greater scrutiny of the agency's decision to allow
mining at Crandall Canyon at all, given what it knew about conditions
that made the mine particularly unstable.

&quot;Despite misleading and self-serving comments to the contrary ...
these miners' lives were jeopardized because of the acts of men,&quot;
United Mine Workers of America International President Cecil Roberts
said Friday.

He expressed doubts about whether MSHA and the mine's owners
&quot;fulfilled their responsibilities&quot; to keep the miners and their
rescuers safe.

Three high-profile accidents, including Sago, where 12 of 13 miners
were killed, helped make 2006 the deadliest for coal mining in 11
years.

The 47 deaths that year triggered sweeping changes to the nation's
coal mining laws.

Observers of the Crandall Canyon accident have criticized MSHA for not
heeding a key provision of the new, post-Sago law, which requires the
government to be the primary communicator with the mine operator, the
media and the public when an accident occurs.

The goal was to prevent a repeat of the confusing and conflicting
information that was given at Sago.

After anxious hours of waiting for a rescue there, family members were
told their loved ones were found alive — only to be told three hours
later that all but one were dead.

Observers say they have heard echoes of Sago in the way Murray has
upstaged Stickler at news conferences since the first day.

Lawmakers have noted that it took MSHA at least two days to take
public control of the scene.

Others were irate that Murray was allowed to publicly predict success
— and contradict MSHA itself — while agency officials quietly looked
on.

For example, Murray has insisted that an earthquake caused the initial
collapse, while government seismologists say the ground shaking was
caused by the cave-in itself.

&quot;It makes MSHA look bad,&quot; said Tony Oppegard, a former top federal and
state of Kentucky mine safety official who now represents miners as a
private attorney in Lexington, Ky.

Others have questioned the decision to allow anyone in the mine but
those who were absolutely necessary for the rescue efforts.

The mine is still experiencing &quot;bumps&quot; — often-violent explosions from
the roof, wall or ground that can send rocks and coal shooting into
tunnels.

Joe Main, an international mine safety consultant and retired top
safety expert for the mine workers union, said Friday that MSHA and
the mine operators could have focused more of their efforts on
drilling exploratory holes from the top to test for signs of life.

Some critics were incredulous last week when Murray led tours of the
mine for family members and a troop of news reporters.

Smith, an 18-year industry observer, said that when she saw news
coverage of the tour, she paced around her living room in a fury and
eventually wrote a heated editorial.

&quot;What were they thinking?&quot; she said in an interview.

&quot;It wasn't safe. The ground's still moving.&quot;

Her fears were realized Thursday.

A bump is believed to have caused the collapse that killed the three
rescue workers.

EVER EVER EVER HEARD OF A MORE BLATANT CASE OF HIRING A FOX TO WATCH
THE CHICKEN COOP

Mine Safety Czar Richard Stickler: Another Bush Fox Guarding the
Henhouse
Huffington Post   |  Max Follmer   |   August 15, 2007 02:28 PM

Santorum

The man who will oversee the federal government's investigation into
the disaster that has trapped six workers in a Utah coal mine for over
a week was twice rejected for his current job by senators concerned
about his own safety record when he managed mines in the private
sector.

President George W. Bush resorted to a recess appointment in October
2006 to anoint Richard Stickler as the nation's mine safety czar after
it became clear he could not receive enough support even in a GOP-
controlled Senate.

In the wake of the January 2006 Sago mine disaster in West Virginia,
senators from both sides of the aisle expressed concern that Stickler
was not the right person to combat climbing death rates in the
nation's mines.

Democrats, led by West Virginia Sens. Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller,
and Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, questioned the safety record of
the mines Stickler ran when he was a coal company executive.

Over the course of his career in the private sector, Stickler managed
various mining operations for Bethlehem Steel subsidiary BethEnergy
Mines, Inc.

The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette reported in January 2006 that three
workers died at BethEnergy mines managed by Stickler during the 1980s
and 1990s.

Gazette reporter Ken Ward, Jr. wrote that in the worst of the
incidents, one mechanic was killed, and eight other workers were
injured when the portal bus that was carrying them to the mine-shaft
bottom derailed. A report later said the portal bus had not been
properly maintained.

Stickler began his career as a general laborer at BethEnergy,
eventually rising to manage the company's operations in Pennsylvania
and Boone County, West Virginia.

He worked briefly for Massey Energy subsidiary Performance Coal in
1996 and 1997 before becoming head of the Pennsylvania mine safety
office. Stickler retired from the post in 2003.

In addition to concerns about the safety record at his mines, Stickler
also faced opposition from senators, union leaders and relatives of
those killed in mine accidents who felt an industry insider should not
oversee safety inspectors.

United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts said that
miners &quot;could not tolerate&quot; another industry executive overseeing
their health and safety.

&quot;Too often these mining executives place priority on productivity, but
fail to focus on miners' health and safety,&quot; Roberts told Mike Hall at
the AFL-CIO's blog in June 2006.

The wife and daughter of a miner killed at Sago wrote a letter to
lawmakers that same month urging them to reject Stickler's nomination.

&quot;Mr. Stickler is a longtime coal executive and because of his
connections with the coal industry, we are concerned that his primary
objectives may be solely on compliance and production, not on miners'
health and safety,'' Debbie Hamner and Sara Bailey wrote in a letter
quoted by the Gazette.

Bush first nominated Stickler to head the Mine Safety and Health
Administration in September 2005. He received renewed attention from
lawmakers following the Sago disaster. By May 2006 it was clear that
Byrd and other Senate opponents would not allow Stickler's nomination
to pass, and Republicans withdrew a scheduled vote on his job.

In July 2006, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao hired Stickler as a
consultant and adviser, but insisted through a spokeswoman that she
was not attempting to circumvent the nomination process.

In August and September of the same year, the Senate twice voted to
send the Stickler nomination back to the White House.

In October 2006, Bush used a recess appointment to install Stickler --
a decision that was quickly denounced by senators from both sides of
the aisle.

Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican, told the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette that he &quot;didn't think Mr. Stickler was the right man for
the job.&quot; Another Pennsylvania Republican, Rick Santorum, also told
the paper he was &quot;disappointed&quot; the White House had not let senators
debate and vote on the nomination.

In a written statement Wednesday, Byrd told The Huffington Post that
MSHA's response to the Crandall Canyon incident will be a test of
Stickler's &quot;worthiness to be properly confirmed by the United States
Senate.&quot;

Byrd also expressed concern about the slow pace of the implementation
of new mining safety laws established in the wake of the Sago
disaster.

&quot;I told Mr. Stickler about my concerns earlier this summer,&quot; he said.
&quot;Until I see better progress from MSHA, I will retain my hold on Mr.
Stickler's nomination

Mine Cave Ins, the Credit Crash and the Poor Helpless Corporate
Victims of Fate
by John Kelley / August 18th, 2007

It's absolutely amazing how people who think they are financial and
business wizards can suddenly become victims of fate according to
them. &quot;It ain't our fault, we're the heroes.&quot; From Bob Murray of
Murray Energy Corporation who was running around trying to impress the
public with how concerned he was about the trapped miners in Utah,
talking about natural disasters, in other words an unforeseeable act
of God to the Wall Street mavens who were calling on the fed to lower
rates and inject cash into the system this week was a new high in
hypocrisy. At best coal mining like financial speculation is a dirty,
someone gets rich, and someone literally gets the shaft business.

Yet here were both looking for sympathy and help from their self-
induced calamity. Murray was telling everyone who would listen how he
was taking care of the miner's families, doing all he could to
extricate them and oh by the way it was an earthquake that caused the
disaster. In fact he had submitted a plan last year for retreat mining
at the site. Retreat mining is used when coal companies greedily want
to get every last piece of coal out of a mine by removing the coal
pillars holding up the roof and allowing it to collapse. The last
pillar is called the &quot;suicide pillar.&quot; While many mine collapses have
caused seismic events in Utah, none have ever been caused by a seismic
event (earthquake). Yet Murray insists he will prove it was an
earthquake. Chalk up another avoidance of responsibility to corporate
America.

When Jim Cramer on MSNBC went into a rant last week talking about
&quot;Armageddon&quot; and how we were all supposed to be upset that people
employed in fleecing poor people into subprime mortgages with
adjustable rates were losing their jobs it was more of the same. Why
is it that these folks who all cry for less regulation, free markets
and minding our own business are the first ones to plead innocence and
ask for a government bailout when their actions cause catastrophe?

All over the airwaves in and in the newspapers, business pundits are
telling investors don't panic, leave your money in the market, in the
meantime the financial pillars have been removed from a ceiling of
debt held up by cheap money loaned for speculation with real little
hope of repayment in the event of the inevitable economic downturn.
The other message I love is the one that says, it's just the mortgage
market, everything else is ok. That message ignores the billions,
maybe trillions of dollars in junk bonds used to finance questionable
speculation in buyouts floating around the financial markets; it
ignores the increasing weakness of the dollar caused by budget
deficits, trade deficits and increasing consumer debt.

When Wal-Mart has to cut prices, the great American consumer spending
machine is tapped out and no matter what anyone says the party is
over. The speculators at Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley
and 9,000 hedge funds are all leveraged to the max and the only way
out is deflation or more free money, hence, the cry for more cash
infusion by the feds and lowering of interest rates. The reality is
they don't have the funds to cover their declining positions and need
the cash to stem the bloodletting.

The real deal is the pundits don't want to be the last ones out and
take the loss. &quot;Please oh please, pump up the market so we can sell
before everyone else catches on.&quot; If these folks were really worried
about the consumer they would be pleading for congress to pass
legislation to allow people who are in danger of foreclosure to rent
their own homes at the market rate until things stabilize and they can
negotiate a reasonable repayment plan. The reason the whole subprime
market was so attractive was because of the unregulated ability to
suck people into thinking they could afford something they couldn't
and by the time they realized it, it would be someone else's problem.

The increase in money in the system is unlikely to increase liquidity
enough to stem the tide. Most banks are hoarding cash because they are
unsure of how exposed to the subprime market they are. Corporations
who are cash heavy have no incentive to buy when an economic downturn
and falling profits are on the immediate horizon. Little of the
increase if any will flow into the system. At the same time consumers
trapped between loss of real income, inflation in energy, food and
medical costs are drowning in debt. Think it will get better, not
likely, $2.7 trillion dollars of adjustable rate mortgages will reset
to higher interest rates between now and 2009. What the big boys are
hoping is that they can get the feds to stall the crash for them to
get out. The problem with that plan, is there will be too many of them
sneaking towards the exits to go unnoticed.

Like an alcoholic who says, &quot;I'll quit tomorrow,&quot; the financial
industry is crying for the government to give them just one more
drink, just one more fix, just a few dollars more. Like all addicts,
this behavior will inevitably come to a catastrophic end. The problem
is that the average consumer won't be able to escape the consequences
(they failed to hire a lobbyist thinking their representative was
protecting their interests)
