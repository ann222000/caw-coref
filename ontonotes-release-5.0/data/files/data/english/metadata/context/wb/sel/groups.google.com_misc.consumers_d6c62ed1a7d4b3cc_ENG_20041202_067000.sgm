CAR ACCIDENT – WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS HERE?

About two weeks ago, my car hit the rear bumper of another Honda car
in front in another city when he stops suddenly, because of another
car in front of him stopped suddenly.

My car's front bumper hit his rear bumper. On his rear bumper, there
were two similar scratches/slight dents – one on left, and one on
right, of the rear PLASTIC bumper. He said the right scratch/dent was
his in a previous car accident. He said the left scratch/dent was
caused by my car hit. My front bumper had no scratch/dent after the
accident.

After we exchanged insurance info, he told me that he would repair
LEFT scratch/dent, and the repair would cost about $50. (In my view,
those two scratches/dents can be fixed in about $20 if done
personally). However, a week later, he faxed me ONE and only estimate
from a Honda dealership estimating the repair cost to be $400. The
$400 repair cost is to replace the WHOLE bumper.

While I am willing to pay for half of $400 (for the left side of the
scratch/dent), he is threatening to go to his insurance company if I
do not pay the $400 to replace his whole bumper. He said that his
action to approach his insurance company would increase my car
insurance premium in the future.

QUESTIONS:

1) Am I the only one at fault and need to pay his damage, getting to
close, although he stopped suddenly?

2) Can he just show one repair estimate (which may be the highest in
all estimates), instead of say three repair estimates (for the lowest)
which he agreed first at first and then decided not to get more
estimates?

3) He wants me to write him a cheque of $400 payable to him
personally. Do I have to pay him personally, instead of paying to the
Honda dealer repair shop? I suspect that, based on the slight
scratches/dents, he might just pocket the money himself without
getting the bumper repaired.

4) Can he insist on me paying for $400 for the whole bumper repaired?
If he goes to his insurance company, is my insurance company required
to pay $400?

5) If my insurance company is involved, do I (customer) generally have
an option paying for the damage, and thus (I hope) would not increase
my insurance premium in the future?

Any advice and comments would be greatly and urgently appreciated!

&gt;QUESTIONS:

&gt;1) Am I the only one at fault and need to pay his damage, getting to

"/> Yup, I think you are screwed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2) Can he just show one repair estimate (which may be the highest in
&gt;all estimates), instead of say three repair estimates (for the lowest)
&gt;which he agreed first at first and then decided not to get more

"/> At least in my state he could. A vehicle owner has the right to
choose who he wants to fix his car.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;getting the bumper repaired.

"/> It is perfectly fine for him to pocket the money. You caused his
vehicle to decrease in value due to the dent/sctarch. Whether he
fixes it and brings the value of his car back up, or puts the money in
his pocket is up to him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;4) Can he insist on me paying for $400 for the whole bumper repaired?
&gt;If he goes to his insurance company, is my insurance company required
&gt;to pay $400?

"/> He can if the only way to repair the damage you caused is to replace
the bumper.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;5) If my insurance company is involved, do I (customer) generally have

"/> Once the insurance company knows about the accident, your premium will
go whether they pay or not.

"/> Yes. If you hadn't been following too closely, you would have been
able to stop without hitting him. You're lucky an officer didn't give
you a ticket for &quot;Assured Clear Distance&quot;.

The fact that the other car stopped quickly is irrelevant. Cars do
stop in traffic; a driver has a legal obligation to leave enough room
ahead that he can stop without hitting the vehicle ahead.

You should have reported this to your insurance company. (Hopefully
it is not too late to do that.) Insurance companies don't just pay
whatever estimate the other driver gives; they try to keep payouts
low. It's even possible that the payout might be too little to
trigger a premium increase, though I wouldn't hold out much hope.

legal on the net, always verify it on your own, in light of your
particular circumstances. You may also need to consult a lawyer.

"/> Yes. The assumption in most states is the rearender is at fault and it
is up to you to prove that you could not avoid hitting the other car
despite taking reasonable precautions. This usually requires something
extraordinary like you hit black ice, skidded out of your lane and
rearended the car in the next lane.

&gt;all estimates), instead of say three repair estimates (for the lowest)
&gt;which he agreed first at first and then decided not to get more

"/> Yes. It is probably his way of getting the maximum money from you and
in theory you can fight it by requiring multiple bids. However as a
practical matter he has you over the barrel. See 4) and 5).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;getting the bumper repaired.

"/> Yes. I have had insurance companies ask me if I wanted to repair the
car or do I want them to just make out the check to me. This is when
the other guy was at fault and it was his company paying for the
repairs. Basically he can chose to just pocket the money if he want to
just as I was allowed to pocket the money if I wanted to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;4) Can he insist on me paying for $400 for the whole bumper repaired?
&gt;If he goes to his insurance company, is my insurance company required
&gt;to pay $400?

"/> If this goes to your insurance company, your company pays for
everything. However your company is in a better position than you to
force him to be reasonable. They can require multiple bids and pay
only the smallest amount. They can say they will only pay the amount
that their adjustor says is valid. Etc. So there is a certain
incentive for the guy to avoid going to your insurance company but you
have more to lose if he does that. See 5).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;5) If my insurance company is involved, do I (customer) generally have
&gt;an option paying for the damage, and thus (I hope) would not increase
&gt;my insurance premium in the future?

"/> Generally speaking no. Just reporting it creates a black mark on your
record that will last about 5 years. It will probably cause an
increase in your rates for those 5 years. That extra money may be more
than $400 over the 5 years or it could be less. Too many black marks
can be cause for cancellation. You have to decide whether it is worth
it or not to pay the $400 yourself and keep the incident off the
books.

will drop his bogus claim. this is just a simple attempt at
extortion.

&quot;New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey announced that a
Mercer County woman charged with masterminding a sophisticated

area has pled guilty to charges of planning and/or participating
in dozens of fake automobile accidents which netted more than
$500,000 in bogus insurance claims.&quot;

"/> I believe it IS true that if you damage someone's bumper badly
enough that it has to be replaced, prior minor damage does not
matter. The victim (or his insurance company) will eventually get
either a settlement or a court order. You do not have to settle,
but court costs may be a lot more than $400.

to be moaning about his back or his neck before the original poster
even got out of his car. According to his original post, that
didn't happen. While the original poster STILL might get a whopping
hospital bill, I think a staged accident would have way more apparent
damage and complaints about injuries on the record.

"/> It is possible that this is a bit of &quot;opportunistic extortion&quot;:
since a REAL accident happened, why not inflate it a little? Then
again, maybe the owner didn't realize that the only way to repair
a plastic bumper is to replace it until he got to the shop, if that
is indeed the case. I don't know whether the bumper needs replacing,
but $400 to replace one seems low. Labor only or parts only, maybe.

There are fake accident rings. I doubt they run their scams for
$400 per accident. It's probably more like $40,000 in injuries
that can't be verified with X-rays or other medical tests (like
back and neck pain). They probably throw in REAL damage to the
car which they can use to justify the phony medical claim.

Pay the $400, just be sure you get some sort of a statement that this
ends the matter--he can't come back later and claim more hidden damage.

IMVAIO, the other driver is being a fool. He should report it to his
insurance. He's taking a risk for no reason. He's being nice to you by
letting you pay without involving the insurance companies. Take
advantage of it.
