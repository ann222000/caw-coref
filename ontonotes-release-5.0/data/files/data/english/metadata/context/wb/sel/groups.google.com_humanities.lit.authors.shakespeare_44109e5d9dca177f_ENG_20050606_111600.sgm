The Apocrypha in the King James Bible
by T.L. Hubeart Jr. © 1999, 2003, 2004 by T.L. Hubeart Jr.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Some have unwisely used the inclusion of the (Old Testament) Apocrypha
in the first printings of the King James Version of the Bible as a basis
for criticism of the KJV. The implication is that the KJV translators
regarded books like &quot;Tobit,&quot;&quot;Judith,&quot; and &quot;1 Maccabees&quot; as being on an
equal level with the canon (as does the Roman Catholic Church in the
cases of eleven out of the fourteen apocryphal books).1 I thought it
would be useful to summarize the most striking evidence against this
idea for the benefit of the reader.

Many indications in the 1611 first edition of the KJV make it obvious
that the translators did not treat the books of the Apocrypha with the
same respect that they did the canonical books. In Catholic Bibles, the
eleven books of the Apocrypha considered by the Roman Church to be
scripture are interspersed with the Hebrew canon; for example, the
Douay-Rheims follows Nehemiah with Tobit and Judith,2 places Wisdom and
Ecclesiasticus after the Song of Solomon, and concludes the Old
Testament with the Books of Maccabees. The KJV, however, segregates
these books between the Testaments. And it is not the first to do this;
this separation had been done as early as Wycliffe, and at the
Reformation others such as Luther and Coverdale had placed
the Apocrypha separately in their complete Bibles.3

The Great Bible of 1539-40 and the Geneva Bible of 1560 even preface
the section with a special advisory. The Great Bible's disclaimer takes
up an entire page, referring to the section as &quot;Hagiographa,&quot;4 citing
Jerome's comments on the book of Judith to the effect that &quot;the
auctorytie therof is not esteamed worthy and sufficient to confyrme &amp;
stablysh&quot; doubtful matters in that book. Therefore, the reader is warned
that &quot;whê[n] thou wilt maynteyne any thynge for certen, rendryng a
reason of thy fayth[,]. . . leaue the thynges that are vncerten to
folowe the certen. . . . For our Christen fayth consysteth not in
doutefull thynges. . . .&quot; 5

The Geneva Bible's prefatory notice deserves to be cited at length:

These bokes that follow in order after the Prophetes vnto the Newe
testament, are called Apocrypha, that is bokes, which were not receiued
by a cõmune consent to be red and expounded publikely in the Church,
nether yet serued to proue any point of Christian religion, saue in
asmuche as they had the consent of the other Scriptures called Canonical
to confirme the same, or rather whereon they were grounded: but as bokes
proceding from godlie men, were receiued to be red for the aduancement
and furtherance of the knowledge of the historie, &amp; for the instruction
of godlie maners: which bokes declare that at all times God had an
especial care of his Church and left them not vtterly destitute of
teachers and meanes to confirme them in the hope of the promised
Messiáh, and also witnesse that those calamities that God sent to his
Church, were according to his prouidence, who had bothe so threatened
by his Prophetes, and so broght it to passe for the destruction
of their enemies, and for the tryal of his children.6

In other words, the Geneva translators were putting a disclaimer on
these books, in the Reformation tradition of considering them (as Luther
said) &quot;useful and good for reading,&quot;7 but not equal to Scripture.

Certain details of the KJV's presentation of these books agree with
those of Great and Geneva. The KJV lacks a similar advisory to the ones
just quoted, but it seems clear that by 1611 the average Bible reader
could be expected to have a fuller awareness of why these books were not
true scripture than was the case when the Great Bible and Geneva first
appeared. Not only had these translations established a precedent of
separating these books from the canon, but in 1562 the Church of England
had adopted its &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion&quot; that specifically
inventories the Apocrypha?s books under Article VI and heads the listing
with these words:

And the other books (as Hierome [Jerome] saith) the Church doth read for
example of life and instruction of manners; but yet it doth not apply
them to establish any doctrine. Such are these following . . . .8

With a background like this on hand by 1611, the KJV men probably felt
that a specific disclaimer heading these books would be superfluous. But
in addition to retaining the separation of the books from the canon, the
running heads that in the canonical books summarize the contents of the
page below9 are replaced in the KJV (as they had been in the Geneva
Bible) with the generic &quot;Apocrypha&quot; throughout these doubtful books.

Another indicator of the lesser status of the Apocrypha in the first
edition of the KJV--where, again, we find a similar practice as in the
first edition Geneva--is in the matter of marginal notes that criticize
the text.10 These are not many in number, but the fact that the text is
criticized at all is a startling departure from the practice of these
translations in the Testaments. In 2 Macc. 12:44, where the apocryphal
writer commends Judas Maccabeus for his decision to pray for the dead,
Geneva's margin contains an extended note contending that &quot;the Greke
text is corrupt&quot; and that &quot;this place was not written by the holie
G[h]ost&quot; because it disagrees with canonical scripture.11 Likewise, in
the book of 1 Esdras, the KJV's margin points out numerous discrepancies
in names and details from the true records of the same transactions
found in the canon. In chapter 5 of 1 Esdras, we find a couple of
extended comments:

[At 5:5:] Ioachim and Zorobabel. This place is corrupt: For Ioachim was
the sonne of Iosedech. Neh. 12.10. and not Zorobabel who was of the
tribe of Iuda.

[At 5:9:] Parosh, Ezra 2.3. Nehem. 7.9 where for breuity looke for the
true numbers of the particulars following: for here they vary much, &amp;
the names much more.

[At 5:40:] Nehemias, who also is Atharias, two of one. Nehe. 8.9 and
10.2. chap. 2.63. [i.e., the translators are saying that the apocryphal
writer has blundered by making one person in his Hebrew source,
the Book of Nehemiah, into two people.] 12

One finds other notations in certain book titles indicating the KJV
translators' view of the Apocrypha. Thus the additional chapters to
Esther found in the LXX, which Jerome's Vulgate had detached from the
Hebrew text, appear with the heading &quot;The rest of the Chapters of the
Booke of Esther, which are found neither in the Hebrew, nor in the
Calde.&quot;13 The additions to Daniel are also marked as &quot;not in the
Hebrew,&quot; the &quot;Song of the Three Holy Children&quot; with a note that is
interesting in another way that we will mention shortly. (It is worth
noting that the Geneva's titles to these books are less insistent in
this respect than the KJV's; perhaps they felt the matter had been
settled by their prefatory note to the section?)14

One more notable feature of the KJV's Apocrypha is the somewhat careless
hand with which it appears to have been completed.15 The evaluation of
stylistic features is naturally subjective, but I find a notable
falling-off from the level of majesty with which the translators
rendered the Old and New Testaments. Some of the fault for this must
naturally be laid at the door of what they were translating in the
Apocrypha--non-scriptural prose which often descends to the prosaic or
the ridiculous16--, but it also appears that the uninspired material
left the king's men less than inspired:

Oftentimes also fair speech of those, that are put in trust to manage
their friends' affairs, hath caused many that are in authority to be
partakers of innocent blood, and hath enwrapped them in remediless
calamities. (Additions to Esther 16:5)

For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we
had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little
spark in the moving of our heart: Which being extinguished, our body
shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air.
(Wisdom of Solomon 2:2-3)

For like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth when it is
broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in the
temple, their eyes be full of dust through the feet of them that come
in. (&quot;Epistle of Jeremy&quot; [Baruch] 6:17).17

Such clunky prose cannot be entirely attributed to the king's men,
since they were chiefly revising previous English translations;18
nevertheless, they allowed it to stand, which indicates that they were
not as concerned about refining the Apocrypha's English rendering as
they were the canon's. More concrete evidence of this appears in the
manner in which supplied words are denoted. Throughout the first edition
KJV, supplied words in the canon are denoted in roman type, to contrast
with the black-letter type in which the rest of the text is printed
(modern KJV printings render these supplied words in italics). However,
in the Apocrypha (and there only, to the best of my knowledge)19, the
first edition's roman type is joined by two other marking methods,
brackets and parentheses, which also denote added words; in a couple of
instances different methods of marking appear in close proximity to each
other (e.g., 1 Macc. 1:7 [parentheses], 9-10 [brackets]; 6:31
[brackets], 43 [parentheses]). Some of the brackets even now appear in
modern printings of the KJV Apocrypha, although most have been
&quot;standardized&quot; to italics. The marking of supplied words in three
different ways throughout the Apocrypha, in marked contrast to the
practice throughout the canon, is very good evidence that this portion
of the 1611 edition was less than carefully prepared.

Another indicator of lack of care is a rather glaring blunder in the
title of &quot;The Song of the Three Holy Children&quot; mentioned above. This
title, meant to indicate at what point in the canonical book of Daniel
the apocryphal &quot;book&quot; was meant to be read, actually references the
wrong verse (the first verse of the apocryphal passage itself rather
than Daniel 3:23, after which is the true insertion point).20 Now it is
true that a certain amount of the gaffes in the first edition's
Apocrypha may stem from the printing house of Robert Barker, the
&quot;Printer to the King's most Excellent Majesty,&quot; who produced the volume;
the canonical books are certainly not free from errors of the press in
this edition. But features such as book titles can only have been
prepared by the translators, or by someone working
under their immediate supervision.

The inconsistencies noted above are frequent enough and substantive
enough to be indicative of the relative unconcern the translators had
for the Apocrypha, and along with the bare-bones presentation and the
occasional marginal comment, show beyond any reasonable doubt that these
books were not held as sacred by the king's men. Obviously, then, anyone
who pretends that the presence of the Apocrypha in the KJV is a
substantive issue affecting the reliability of the rest of the
translation is either blowing smoke or wallowing in ignorance. To borrow
a phrase from these uninspired books, the whole objection is nothing
more than &quot;a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers&quot; that &quot;keepeth nothing&quot;!21

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1The Roman Church does not recognize 1 or 2 Esdras or the Prayer of
Manasseh (&quot;Manasses&quot; in KJV) as being part of scripture, but these
do appear in an appendix to the Latin Vulgate.

2 For purposes of convenience, I am calling both canonical and
apocryphal books by their KJV names, though it should be noted that many
of the Douay-Rheims names differ (e.g., &quot;2 Esdras alias Nehemias&quot; for
Nehemiah, &quot;Tobias&quot; for Tobit), as do some of those given by the Great
and Bishops' Bibles (e.g., 1 and 2 Esdras are numbered as 3 and 4
Esdras). Also, adding to the confusion, modern translations that include
the Apocrypha (such as the New American Bible, the current pulpit Bible
of the Roman Catholic Church in America) refer to Ecclesiasticus as
&quot;Sirach.&quot; (The New American Bible also differs in order from the
Douay-Rheims [whose order reflects the Clementine Vulgate's sequence],
but continues the practice of placing the Apocrypha with the Hebrew canon.)

3 Thomas Witton Davies, &quot;Apocrypha,&quot; in International Standard Bible
Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, as given on Master Christian Library CD (Version
6) by AGES Software, Albany, OR. It is well to note here that Geneva's
separation of the Apocrypha is not complete, since it places the &quot;Prayer
of Manasseh&quot; between 2 Chronicles and Ezra (with the marginal comment
&quot;This prayer is not in the Ebrewe, but is translated out of the Greke&quot;).
Strangely, neither Geneva, the Bishops' Bible, nor KJV bothers to divide
this book into verses; I would be tempted to classify this as another
example of the KJV's disregard for the Apocrypha were it not for the
example of its predecessors here. Still, it does seem odd that this is
the only &quot;biblical book&quot; (to use the term very loosely) that does not
have verse divisions in the original KJV.

4 Technically, the Great Bible's term is inaccurate; according to the
Oxford English Dictionary (ed. 2), &quot;Hagiographa&quot; actually refers to &quot;The
Greek name (lit. 'sacred writings') of the last of the three great
divisions of the Hebrew Scriptures. . .&quot;--in other words, the books not
considered part of either &quot;the Law&quot; or &quot;the Prophets.&quot; But the first
English usage in this sense that is recorded by O.E.D. does not occur
until 1583, and the Great Bible's use is not registered. It is odd that
the Great Bible here did not follow the example of Matthew's Bible,
which properly entitles these books as Apocrypha: &quot;The volume of/the
bokes called Apocripha:/Contayned in the comen Transl./in Lateyne, which
are not/founde in the Hebrue/nor in the/Chalde&quot; (qtd. from the
illustration given in David Daniell, William Tyndale: A Biography, New
Haven and London: Yale UP, 1994/2000 [corrected paperback ed.],
illustration 11 following p. 214). This Apocrypha title page even looks
similar in design to the later one in the Great Bible.

and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture (NY: Anchor
Books, 2001), pp. 223 and 225 (quote on latter page; bracketed addition
mine).

9 For example, on the first three pages of Genesis, Geneva gives &quot;The
creation of the worlde.&quot;; &quot;The creation of man. The creation of woman.&quot;;
&quot;The woman seduced.&quot; Similar running heads appear at the tops of pages
(on the side nearest the spine of the book) in most editions of the
Bible today.

10 I am grateful to Dr. Thomas Holland for investigating this matter
with me and helping to uncover and evaluate this marginal note evidence.
Since my original writing of this essay in 1999, he has also made
reference to these KJV marginal comments in his book Crowned With Glory:
The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version (San Jose: Writer's
Club Press, 2000), pp. 94-95.

11 Fol. Bbbbb.ii. recto. Compare also the Bishops' Bible's note at III
Esdras (=1 Esdras) 1:38; the facsimile I have (PDF file on CD, 1595
&quot;Deputies of Christopher Barker&quot; ed.) is unfortunately not wholly
legible in the margin here, but the words &quot;This place is corrupt&quot; can
be clearly seen. Such notes probably carry on the tradition of the
Great Bible's admonition &quot;To the Reader&quot; prefacing this section,
which had warned that the apocryphal books
&quot;haue been corrupted and falsifyed in many places. . . .&quot;

12 These quotations and subsequent ones are taken from the Thomas Nelson
reprint (1982) of the first edition KJV. (The 2003 Hendrickson
Publishers ?1611 Edition, King James Version? provides an identical
text, both originating in an 1833 Oxford University Press reprint in
modern type.)

13 This title essentially agrees with those of the Great and Bishops'
Bibles in this place. The result of such a separation in Esther is, of
course, that the additional chapters are utterly incomprehensible unless
one knows at what points the additions are to be inserted into the
(canonical) text of Esther. To avoid such confusion, the NRSV's
Apocrypha translates the whole of the Greek version of Esther so that
the interpolated chapters may be read in context.

14 In fact, in a few instances the KJV's titles are more insistent than
those of any of its predecessors as to the unauthoritative character of
these books. For example, where the Great Bible refers to &quot;The story of
Susanna, whych is the xiij. Chapter of Danyel after the Latyn&quot;
(substantially retained by the Bishops' Bible), and Geneva adds that
&quot;some ioyne [it] to the end of Daniel,&quot; the KJV's title says that
Susanna has been &quot;set apart from the beginning of Daniel,
because it is not in the Hebrew. . . .&quot;

15I would like to point out that a special division of the KJV
translation team, working from Cambridge, was entrusted with &quot;the Prayer
of Manasses and the rest of the Apocrypha&quot; (see David Daniell, The Bible
in English, New Haven and London: Yale, 2003, p. 436; the translators,
including those for the Apocrypha, are listed in Alister McGrath's In
the Beginning, pp. 179-182; Thomas Holland's Crowned With Glory, pp.
225-8; and other works dealing with the history of the KJV). Were these
men of lesser ability than the remainder of the translators working on
inspired scripture? That cannot be wholly true, if true at all, since
one of their number was Dr. John Bois, who was later to serve as a
member of the final revision team for the entire KJV. Were they simply
uninterested in perfecting this less-than-sacred stretch of text, and so
let many things pass into their revision that would not have been
allowed to stand in the inspired books? Whatever the case, it is
difficult for me not to see this as another demonstration that God was
at work in the 1611 version, since the variance between the work done on
the canon and that done in these uninspired books--all of them the
responsibility of one body of men, and with the final editing done by
select members of them--is so striking. One would have reasonably
expected a more consistent level between the two sections, and perhaps
that the whole of the final result could have easily been as mediocre as
the &quot;Apocrypha&quot;--but obviously God intended otherwise.

(I should also mention that Alister McGrath in his In the Beginning
makes the statement that &quot;The task of translating the apocryphal books
was entrusted to the Second Cambridge Company, who are generally thought
to have discharged their duties well&quot; [p. 226; emphasis mine]--an
appraisal for which I'd be interested in knowing McGrath's basis, but
unfortunately this is not stated, and since the volume lacks footnotes
throughout and has only a general &quot;List of Works Consulted&quot; at the end,
I am unable to trace the source for it. Also unsourced but more
believable is Adam Nicolson?s passing remark in God?s Secretaries: The
Making of the King James Bible [NY: Perennial/HarperCollins, 2003]
that the Apocrypha is ?generally acknowledged to be
the least satisfactory part? of the KJV [p. 199].)

16For an example of the latter, see the preposterous &quot;vision&quot; of 2
Esdras 11:1ff. (an eagle with multiple heads and feathers that reign and
vanish, after which the eagle apparently bursts into flames [12:3] !).

17 These quotes follow a modern reprint of the KJV Apocrypha (Oxford,
n.d.). It should be mentioned that, like most Apocrypha-only reprints I
have seen (and the Apocrypha sources online), this gives the text only;
to see the marginal notes, one must consult either the Thomas Nelson or
Hendrickson Publishers KJV 1611 reprint mentioned above or one of the
large pulpit KJV Bibles with Apocrypha.

18 Comparison of the three passages cited in the main text between the
KJV and its predecessors is instructive. The following table gives all
four cited versions in original spelling to allow for complete equality
in the presentation. (Note that there are some slight variances in verse
numbering between Geneva, Bishops', and the KJV;
the Great Bible has no verse numbering.)&gt;&gt;
