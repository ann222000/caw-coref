I bought my dog a stroller to enable us to go to malls and places that
are not pet friendly.  It arrived this afternoon and my dog is afraid
of it, all she does is bark and growl at it, any suggestions?

We've brought the dog shopping in her carrier bag but she gets really
heavy after a while.  If the pets are contained and not on a leash
they will allow them.
They are not pet friendly toward leashed dogs.  (Better choice of
words?)

I wouldn't mind one of these for my x breed dog , he only weighs 5lb but he
feels heavy after a while. What breed is your dog ?
Leave the stroller out and leave treats around it and inside until he
comes round in his own time. Once he's comfortable with it, start of
pushing it around inside your home for a minute or two and build up from
there.

Janet,
After 20 minutes of carrying 10 pounds on my right shoulder, I start
walking like Quasimodo.  After one hour, I start looking like him.  I
lose my urge to shop and that's not good for my well being.  I like to

I think you misunderstood.  I don't care how you tote your dog (although
I admit that I don't think I PERSONALLY couldn't feel really odd with a
doggie stroller! ;-D).  The whole point of little dogs is that you can
take them places.  If your mode is by stroller, I have no problem with
that.  Of course - don't be surprised if you get some snickers!   I
think I've be more of a shopping cart/little red wagon user myself!

I don't think people should be sneaking pets into stores.  If they have
permission, that's another story, but breaking rules/laws gives good pet
owners a bad rap, and can give ammunition to proponents of legislation

What is your definition of a good pet owner?
Good pet owners don't want to leave their pets for that many hours or
days.  My pup is welcomed everywhere in her carrier.  A stroller would
make life easier for me.  If people want to snicker, I can handle that
too.  I'd probably get a good chuckle out of it myself.
Thank you, Alison!  You gave me the advice I needed.
Everyone else:  Don't take life so seriously.  You're missing all the
fun.  Like they say:  Life isn't a dress rehersal.  The second act
will start faster than you think and then it's final curtain!  Loosen
up!  Don't be afraid of the snickering women at Walmart.

This morning I went for a ski on an old pair of touring skis
(the bindings have *purple* bumpers!) I've had forever.  The
snow that fell yesterday and last night is really nice but
because of the recent thaw there's water all over the place
and because of the amount of water not much has refrozen, so
in pretty short order I ended up with ice all over the skis.
It was pretty easy to get the ice off the bottoms but the
bindings were such a mess that after I took one ski off to
get the ice out I couldn't get it back on.  So, I ended up
hiking home.  As I mentioned I'm trying to make better use
of the gear I've got, and while the skis themselves were a
lot better to ski on than I remembered those bindings were
pretty unpleasant.  I'd be sorry to lose those purple
accents on the bindings, though.

ObDog: came home to bloody diarrhea all over the kitchen.
Fortunately the culprit has an appointment for her annual
checkup first thing Monday morning, anyway.  Unfortunately I
haven't gotten into town yet to buy that stuff Janet
recommended.

You'd like my old K2 5500 orginal issue alpine skis.  Red, white and blue
with the Olympic rings, very obnoxious.  The Marker Rotomat bindings are
also red, white and blue.  The rig was nearly free since I worked in a
ski shop, but they were purchased the last year I worked there and so I
never traded up.  I took them to Colorado last time I skiied there
because, well, WTH, they are perfectly wonderful skiis and I enjoyed the
sniggers.

Oof.

I've used that stuff Janet recommends and I'm not as impressed.
Personally I find a handheld spot cleaner (think mini carpet steam
cleaner) works better than anything else, and on any surface.  It'll suck
up the nasties AND you can clean.  Just add some hot tap water and
whatever cleaner you have on hand.  Emptying it is no picnic, but it's
not THAT bad.  As long as you keep the battery charged, you never have to
run to the store to resupply.

Of course I have WTW carpet in most of my house, so it's been a godsend,
but I use it on the concrete downstairs (one of the cats loves puking
down there), on the hardwood and on the tile.
