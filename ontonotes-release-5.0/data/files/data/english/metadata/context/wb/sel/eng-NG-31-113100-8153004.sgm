Thank you for the quick reply.

What does this phrase literally mean?

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;literally.&quot;  If you try to analyze it
word-by-word, it makes very little sense.  It's a classic example of
an English idiom.

What the idiom means in actual usage is that the act following &quot;then&quot;
occurs almost immediately after the one following &quot;no sooner.&quot;  So
someone reading the sentence I posted would interpret it as saying
that my response came almost immediately after your inquiry.  (Which
explains my earlier parenthetical comment.)

Perhaps the most common sentence using the form is &quot;No sooner said
than done,&quot; which is a compression of &quot;No sooner did you say you
wanted something done than I did it&quot; -- &quot;You asked, and I did it
almost immediately afterward.&quot;  This means essentially the same as my
example but without the specifics of what was said and done.

I'm not sure what &quot;proper&quot; use is, but this is the common use:

No sooner than I had thrown out all of my old dress shirts, my wife
decided the living room needed painting and I had to buy a work shirt
to paint in.

It's used to indicate that something has happened or was needed
shortly after an action was taken that turned out to be premature.

That, to me, isn't a good example.  There is usually an element of
(American) irony involved when the phrase is used.  For example,

No sooner than I had posted the question, I came across an article

As in &quot;No sooner said than done&quot;?   And by the way, it's a complete
sentence, not a phrase.  But I don't dispute that sometimes it's used

YMMV.

Semantics aside, my understanding of the idiom, and the way I use it,
requires &quot;than&quot; where you have a comma.  To my ear, omission of &quot;than&quot;
makes it unidiomatic.

He asked about a phrase.  The phrase is in the subject line, and it's
not a sentence.  He refers to it as a phrase.

Two different sayings.  &quot;No sooner than...&quot; is the beginning of a
sentence that will have an unspecified ending so it's a phrase.  &quot;No
sooner said than done&quot; is a complete sentence and refers to a specific
action and it is not used ironically.   &quot;Said&quot; and &quot;done&quot; are not in
the first one.  Neither &quot;said&quot; nor &quot;done&quot; is required when using the
phrase.

His complete post was:

&quot;I have forgotten the proper use of this phrase.  Can someone show me
an example?&quot;

My sentence would probably be more idiomatic with the second &quot;than&quot; or
a &quot;when&quot;.  I will give you that.

I also disagree with the use of &quot;nuance&quot;.  In a sentence that starts
with the phrase &quot;No sooner than...&quot;, there would not normally be a
subtle distinction involved.  The rest of the sentence will spell out
what happened shortly after the action that was taken or not taken.

Another example:  No sooner than I missed an insurance payment, I had
an accident.  (No second &quot;than&quot; required)  No nuance.

No sooner had I made the last payment on the house than the garage
collaped, the septic tank exploded, and an electric fire started in
the basement.  I agree that there is usually a small time delay, but I
think Bob's example relies both on the time delay and on exaggeration,
since posting must be sooner than replying.

In theory all those bad things that happened to the house could have
happened at the same moment as when the house payment was made.

There's a tv commercial running now, where they couple is driving, and
she makes the last payment on the car with her cell phone, and the
rear view mirror falls off the window maybe 4 seconds after she hangs
up.  As if paying off the car caused it to break.

In Tony's last example, his actions were premature**, but there are
other cases where that's not it at all.

No sooner had she arrived in Los Angeles than she got an audition and
was hired for a part.

No sooner had I hung the laundry on the line than did it start to
rain.

No sooner had he gotten off the landing craft at Normandy than he was
killed by German artillery.  Staying in the landing craft until they
stopped shooting was not an option.

Your &quot;was needed&quot; is also superfluous.  Needing something is no more
common a use of this phrase than dozens or hundreds of other
situation.

**Who would throw out all his old shirts?   You need them for work and

I'm trying to figure out the difference.  You've deleted &quot;has&quot; and
changed &quot;...something has happened...&quot; to &quot;something happened&quot;.

I don't know why you feel that change is beneficial, but I don't see a
problem with your version.  You've changed &quot;was taken&quot; to &quot;had been
taken&quot;.  Again, I don't see a need for the change but I don't see a
problem with the change.

Seems like we're both saying the same thing with very minor
differences.  I'd go with either one.

Agreed.  My example was where I think the phrase is most often used:
the ironic combination of events.  It *can* be used with other
examples, but we tend to trot it out for the ironic combination.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No sooner had I hung the laundry on the line than did it start to

That's the ironic combination, though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;killed by German artillery.
">

Ironic in a sense, but context would determine how ironic.  If the
rest of story was about hardships endured but survived before the
landing, then the ironic aspect comes in.  If his ship (not the
landing craft) was strafed and damaged by mines, it would be ironic
that he died immediately after landing on the beach.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Your &quot;was needed&quot; is also superfluous.  Needing something is no more

I think it is more common.  While we don't need to reserve the phrase
for the ironic combination, we generally do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;**Who would throw out all his old shirts?   You need them for work and

Actually, that was based on real life.  My old dress shirts were
thrown out not because they were old, but because they started showing
gaps where they buttoned.  Shortly after I got around to that, I had
to go out and buy some cheap painting and yard work shirts.

IMO...
(1)the present perfect tense *has* should be replaced by a past tense.
(2)the word 'action' at the end should have been qualified by either
the word 'which' or in this case *that*.
(3)'action was taken' should have been 'action that had been taken' or
a past perfect tense, because this action had taken place before the
action&quot;turned out to be premature&quot;.

&gt; &gt;Tony, please allow me the pleasure of venturing into re-phrasing your
&gt; &gt;sentence above from the point of view of a non-native English speaker.

&gt; &gt;I would put it as follows:

&gt; &gt;&quot;It's used to indicate that something happened or was needed
&gt; &gt;shortly after an action that had been taken turned out to be
&gt; &gt;premature.&quot;

&gt; &gt;What do you think?

&gt; I'm trying to figure out the difference.  You've deleted &quot;has&quot; and
&gt; changed &quot;...something has happened...&quot; to &quot;something happened&quot;.

&gt; I don't know why you feel that change is beneficial, but I don't see a
&gt; problem with your version.  You've changed &quot;was taken&quot; to &quot;had been
&gt; taken&quot;.  Again, I don't see a need for the change but I don't see a
&gt; problem with the change.

&gt; Seems like we're both saying the same thing with very minor
&gt; differences.  I'd go with either one.

Actually I think there is a couple of grammatical errors in your
sentence.  In particular, the word action needs to be qualified by
&quot;had been taken&quot;.

....action (that had been taken) turned out to be premature.

Please notice the word *that* in your original sentence.

Now the sentence is complete.

Well, my examples used the past perfect.  I guess you include that.

But I'm reading tony's post now, and I also don't see why you changed
has happened to happened.  They're pretty much the same and both seem
to describe your phrase just fine, and it seems more important to use
the phrase correctly that to quibble about Tony's or anyone's

My gosh you're quibbling.

Native speaker or not, I think one would break his brain trying first
to define the proper wording of the phrase, and then to apply that
definition to its use.  Both of those steps are going to be difficult
or impossible.  Just watch how it used and use it the same way.

I see you are a non-native speaker.  Your English seems pretty good,
but whether Tony and I say it or not, whether we realize it or not,
we're probably considering a lifetime's worth of examples and trying
to allow for all of them.

I'm lost here.  I guess &quot;Tong&quot; is &quot;Tony&quot;, but I have not described an
event that happened &quot;some time back&quot;, and I certainly described an
event that has relevance to whatever is up at the present moment in
the telling.

The discussion was about the use of &quot;No sooner than...&quot; and I
described an event (throwing out old shirts) that was linked to
another event (needing old shirts to paint in).  The timing of the
occurrence of the linked events is irrelevant since I'm relating an
anecdote, but there's nothing to say that they happened last year or
yesterday.

Americans tend to use &quot;ironic&quot; to describe any combination of
events/actions that are even slightly different from the expected.
&quot;It's ironic that you should call since I just added you to my list of
people to call today&quot; might be heard and not met with objection, but
the combination of events really isn't ironic.

We do describe combinations that involve luck - good or bad - as
ironic.  We're thinking of the definition of irony that reads:
&quot;incongruity between the actual result of a sequence of events and the
normal or expected result (2): an event or result marked by such
incongruity&quot;, but we're really stretching &quot;incongruity&quot; here.

The amusing thing is that we can say &quot;&quot;It's ironic that you should
call since I just added you to my list of people to call today&quot; or we
can say &quot;It's serendipitous that you should call since I just added
you to my list of people to call today&quot; to describe the same thing.

The first might indicate that there's a little disappointment that the
caller got the jump on the person intending to call, and the second
might mean the called person is pleased to receive the call.  We're
describing reaction and not incongruity.

Let's not get on the &quot;since&quot; and &quot;because&quot; thing.  I'm relating what
is often actually said and not what should be said.
