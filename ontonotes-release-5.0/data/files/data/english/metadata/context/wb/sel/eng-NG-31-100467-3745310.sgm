Do you see a synchronicity between today's arrest of a person for the
suspected killing of Jon Benet Ramsey and today's release of
considering Ceres,2003 UB313,and Charon as planets?

I do. I could see nurturing issues brought up. Like Jon Benet's mother
would be vindicated. What about the possible of Jon Benet's spirit
wandering and being in limbo, but now the possible discovery of her
killer could give her peace so she can go into the light and start a
new life.You can see that I have watched GHOST WHISPER on television.
heheheehe

Ceres having to do with nurturing.

Charon ferried souls across the Styx and if they couldn't pay them,
they were wandering on the banks of the Styx. I would say that would
seem like the soul was in limbo.

2003 UB313 could relate to finding the light and rebirth.

These are just opinions of mine.

Hmm... haven't been paying any attention to that Jon-Benet Ramsey case,
so, I guess I don't.  But, I can follow your reasoning.

Whatever the case may be, I hope little Jon-Benet is doing well,
wherever she is.

Yes, and mothering in general, I think.  My guess is the only reason
Ceres has never stood out to me much in astrology is because being a
mother is not something I'm particularly interested in doing.

But perhaps it is prominent in the charts of people who _are_ very
interested in such things.  I wouldn't know, I haven't looked.

Yes.  Or maybe, in transition between one state of being and another.
I wonder if limbo exists... and what it consists of exactly.

As for using Charon as an astrological planet - I think one problem
with using Charon as a planet is, it's so close to Pluto, there's
hardly any difference astrologically since they both occupy
practically exactly the same spot in the zodiac.

Hmm... I haven't really seen too many delineations of 2003 UB313.
Haven't looked either, though.

I rather like the idea of considering 2003 UB313 a planet, though, for
rather selfish reasons... :-)

The street number of the house I grew up in was 313.  It might give me
a slight sense of cosmic importance to think that there's an entire
planet whose name involves my very own house number. ;)

I guess I might like the idea of considering UB313 to be associated
with rebirth, too.  I am very interested in reincarnation.

And, many of my dreams which relate to my possible former life involve
my old house at 313, which just happened to be built exactly the same
year that my possible former self was born - 1890. :)

However, I think my personal preferred definition for a planet would
be, something at least Pluto-sized, which orbits the sun, and has
an atmosphere.

I don't know how many gigantic space rocks out there match that
description, but, in any case, it appeals to me.  If I'm not mistaken,
even Mercury and Pluto both have atmospheres, so that means we
wouldn't lose them.

But in the end I don't think it really matters whether any given
hunk of rock out there is subjectively considered a planet or not.
I don't see why that should stop anything from "working"
astrologically.  (Assuming any of this stuff really works in the
first place).

Same here. :)
