If objects are known by their properties, then presumably an object
per se has no properties. Yet we say it 'exists'. How could science
ever prove, or demonstrate such an object apart from its properties?

On the other hand, of course, we might want to say that if an object
is known by its properties, then this same object ALSO has these
properties as its internal properties, or is itself these properties.
So, for example, if an object deflects a weighing scale then the
object shows the properties of matter, and IS ITSELF matter. That is,
its internal properties are the same as its external properties. But
how could we ever find out? If we wanted to be empirical/scientific
about it, then we could never declare that an object is in itself its
own properties, and say, for example, that an object that has material
properties is itself matter, for we have no scientific access to
'inner' 'properties'.

So to be practical or scientific about it, we cannot speak of objects
as they are in themselves, as having 'inner' properties. We simply
don't have access to objects beyond their 'properties'. All we can do
when talking about objects is to speak about properties. As for the
'object itself', as it is in itself in its intrinsicness, this simply
drops out of consideration.

But then it is not right to speak of 'properties' without an object.
We stretch customary language a little too far. So rather than try and
retain the idea of an object which we can never find out about, that
is, an object that is considered apart from its properties, we should,
rather, rename 'properties' as 'appearances'. This is not to make them
into imaginary things. It simply means that 'appearances' are to be
considered as utterly empty of any ontological (substance, self-
identity) substrate.

You're not very good at this are you?

You cant deny existence without first accepting there is something
existing to deny, i.e. without contradiction. Existence is axiomatic.

Your mission, should you ever choose to awaken from your Kantian
slumber, is to identify that which you claim to exist and to do so
without contradiction in your identification. why? Because there are
no contradictions in reality and that can not be denied without
accepting it as the standard to do so.

Science identifies and if they claim something exists, then the burden
of proof is upon them.

Sounds like political correctness. Observation is theory laden right?
Properties themselves are based upon observations but do you prefer
talk of &quot;sense-datum&quot; or &quot;adverbial theories&quot; which are descriptions
of processes? How about phenomenalism where those properties are only
abstracted out of the world when humans and animals are around but
disappear afterwords?

The Sense-Datum Theory: ...the most widely held view historically
concerning the strictly sensory aspect of immediate or given
experience is that what is given in such experience is not public
physical objects, but rather sense-data (or sometimes sensa): private,
non-physical entities that actually possess the various sensory
qualities that a person experiences. (For a variant usage of this
term, see Moore [1953], who there uses the term &quot;sense-datum&quot; to stand
for whatever it is that is immediately experienced or given, possibly
even a public physical object, and then argues somewhat tentatively
that the entities that actually have this status are sense-data in the
more usual sense, rather than physical objects.)

The Adverbial Theory: ...The sense-datum theory is often characterized
as an act-object theory of the nature of immediate experience: it
accounts for such experience by postulating both an act of awareness
(or apprehension) and an object (the sense-datum) which that act
apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the
adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such
objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether
they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is
suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with
its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of
immediate experience. ...a certain distinctive sort of experiential
state....

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/

Phenomenalism:  ...is the view that physical objects do not exist as
things in themselves but only as perceptual phenomena or sensory
stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated
in time and in space. In particular, phenomenalism reduces talk about
physical objects in the external world to talk about bundles of sense-
data.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenalism

-Observation is theory-laden

...Empiricists assume that we can learn from experience that
particular observation-statements are correct. For example, we
experience the table and thereby come to know that the statement
'There is a table here' is true. But this overlooks the gap which
exists between the experiences we have when looking at the table and
the statement we formulate on the basis of those experiences.

We must formulate observation-
statements, for according to
empiricism they are the ultimate
premises from which other
statements are to be proved:

experiences themselves are just
happenings and cannot be the
premises of any argument.

But when we do formulate observation-statements, they transcend the
experiences which prompt them. And what leads statements to transcend
experience is the language in which the statements are formulated.

For example, when we look in the direction of the table and declare '
There is a table here' we interpret certain sensory inputs as
indicating the presence of a table.

But if we did not previously know
the meaning of the word 'table',
or possess the concept of a
table, then we could not formulate
the observation-statement.

A creature which did not possess the concept of a table could still
see the table; but such a creature could not learn from this
experience that there is a table here and could not formulate the
observation report 'Here is a table'.

Philosophers have drawn a distinction between seeing and seeing-that
(or more generally, between perceiving and per-ceiving-that).

It is similar to the distinction between knowing and knowing-that.

A cat may see the table, but if the cat does not possess the concept
of a table then he cannot see that there is a table here.

A person who does not possess the concept of a galvanometer (does not
know what the word 'galvanometer' means) may see a galvanometer in a
physics laboratory, but cannot see that there is a galvanometer
there.

Seeing-that is propositional and
requires that the observer possesses
the words or concepts needed to
formulate the proposition in question.

Seeing is not propositional and does
not require the possession
of any concept.

What makes seeing-that possible is the prior understanding of language
or concepts. It is language which enables us to see that (or more
generally, perceive that) things are the case, and hence to formulate
observation-statements.

Now, the gap between experiences
and observation reports, a gap filled
by language or concepts, is an
important source of the
fallibility of observation
reports.

We all see the table and do not hesitate to accept the observation
statement 'There is a table'. But what if someone were to fiddle
around at the back of the 'table' and all of a sudden Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony were to fill the room? Would we then be inclined to say
that we were wrong, that the object was not a table after all but a
rather swish and streamlined stereo? If we would say this, then in
reporting 'There is a table' we were tacitly committed to the
prediction that it would not emit Beethoven's Fifth. And because this
prediction turned out to be mistaken, we were prepared to give up the
observation report which committed us to it.

The point can be generalised.

In attending to sensory stimuli
and interpreting them in a certain
way so as to formulate observation
reports, we always employ words or
concepts which commit us to certain
predictions regarding our
future experiences.

Since any of these predictions might
turn out to be mistaken, future
experiences might always lead us
to reject a past observation
report.

This is what we mean by saying that any observation report transcends
the experience which prompts it and is therefore fallible.

How precisely does this transcendence come about? How can 'Here is a
table' commit us to any prediction? In our particular example, the
prediction actually arises not simply from the observation report but
from a general principle also, as follows:

Observation report:
Here is a table.

General principle:
Tables, unlike stereos, do not play music.

Prediction:
This object will not play music.

More generally, the structure of the predictive arguments is like
this:

Observation report:
A is an X.

General principle:
X's do/do not do Y.

Prediction:
A will/will not do Y.

Now the argument we have proposed says that since the predictions
might always be mistaken, we might always be led to reject our
observation report...

In logic, begging the question is the term for a type of fallacy
occurring in deductive reasoning in which the proposition to be proved
is assumed implicitly or explicitly in one of the premises. For an
example of this, consider the following argument: &quot;Only an
untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians
are untrustworthy is proof of this.&quot; Such an argument is fallacious,
because it relies upon its own proposition-in this case, &quot;politicians
are untrustworthy&quot;-in order to support its central premise.
Essentially, the argument assumes that its central point is already
proven, and uses this in support of itself.

You skipped the part about the justification for believing that I have
ears. Besides, there is a very small possibility, which no one so far
has been able to eliminate, in which I could be a brain in a vat with
wires running into me. I might have no senses at all but am fed the
data and I interact with the data and a mad scientists changes the
appearance of the world to accomadate my perceptial reality. If true
then I never would have had ears to begin with but only perceived that
I did.

Dr. Know &amp; the Braino Helmet

Imagime that a superscientist invents machine--we shall call it a
&quot;braino,&quot; - that enables him to produce hallucianations in certain
subjects . The machine operates by influencing the brain of a subject
who wears a special cap, called a &quot;braino cap.&quot; when the braino cap is
placed on a subject's head, the operator of the braino can affect his
brain so as to produce any hallucination in the subject that the
operator wishes. The braino is a hallucination-producing machine. The
hallucinations produced by it may be as incomplete, systematic, and
coherent as the operator of the branio desires to make them.

The present argument starts from the premise that the braino is a
logical possibility, and consequently that there should be
hallucinations that are coherent, complete, and systematic in every
way. From the premise of logical possibility, we conclude that we in
fact have no way of telling whether or not we are hallucinating.

If the braino is a logical possibility, then how can we tell that
hallucinations are not in fact so hard to detect? On the contrary, we
may suffer hallucinations that we cannot detect. If it is logically
possible that hallucinations should be coherent, complete, and
systematic in every way, then there is no way of detecting at any
moment that we are not suffering from a hallucionation.

How we can tell that we are not hallucinating. The braino argument is
intended to establish that we can never tell this, even if we can
sometimes tell that we are hallucinating. Consider some perceptual
belief that you would maintain does not from hallucinations. what
experiences guarantee this? Indeed, what experiences provide you with
any evidence of it?

Notice that whatever experience you indicate, the braino argument will
be quite sufficient to prove that such an experience is no guarantee
against hallucianation. All we need do is imagine that you have,
unknown to yourself, the braino cap on your head. the operator of the
braino is producing the very experiences you claim guarantee that you
are not hallucinating.

Imagine that all people are controlled by the braino and that the
machine is run by some evil being, Dr. Know, who plots to keep us
completely in error through hallucinations. Dr. Know does not wish to
be detected, so he supplies hallucinations that are coherent,
complete, and systematic. Indeed, the hallucinations he produced in us
are a PERFECT COUNTERFEIT OF REALITY.

Our experiences fulfill our expectations and contain no more surprises
than we would expect from reality. But is it not reality we
experience; our perceptual beliefs about the world are quite mistaken,
for the source of our experiences is a mere machine, the braino, which
creates hallutionations. In such a predicament we might have just the
sort of perceptual beliefs we now have, based on experiences exactly
similar to those we now have. But our perceptual beliefs would be
altogether false.

The imagined situation is exactly similar to ours with respect to the
reasons or evidence we would have for our perceptual beliefs.
Experience is virtually the same in both cases. Consequently, if we
lack knowledge in one situation, we must surely lack it in the other.
Obviously, we lack knowledge when we are controlled by the braino, for
then our perceptual beliefs are false. Hence, we also lack knowledge
in our present situation. More precisely, our perceptual beliefs fail
to constitute knowledge in either case.

We believe that we are not controlled by such a machine, and if we are
fortunate in this belief, then no doubt many of our perceptual beliefs
are true. It is, however, good fortune and not good evidence that we
should thank for correctness of these beliefs.

We are just lucky if there is no Dr. Know controlling us with a
braino; and from that good fortune may result the further good fortune
that most of our perceptual beliefs are true. it is just a matter of
luck, however, and nothing epistemologically more glorious than that.

If a belief is true as a result of luck, then it is a lucky guess--not
knowledge.

&gt;  premises of any argument.

&gt; But when we do formulate observation-statements, they transcend the
&gt; experiences which prompt them. And what leads statements to transcend
&gt; experience is the language in which the statements are formulated.

&gt; For example, when we look in the direction of the table and declare '
&gt; There is a table here' we interpret certain sensory inputs as
&gt; indicating the presence of a table.

&gt;  But if we did not previously know
&gt;  the meaning of the word 'table',
&gt;  or possess the concept of a
&gt;  table, then we could not formulate
&gt;  the observation-statement.

&gt; A creature which did not possess the concept of a table could still
&gt; see the table; but such a creature could not learn from this
&gt; experience that there is a table here and could not formulate the
&gt; observation report 'Here is a table'.

&gt; Philosophers have drawn a distinction between seeing and seeing-that
&gt; (or more generally, between perceiving and per-ceiving-that).

&gt; It is similar to the distinction between knowing and knowing-that.

&gt; A cat may see the table, but if the cat does not possess the concept
&gt; of a table then he cannot see that there is a table here.

&gt; A person who does not possess the concept of a galvanometer (does not
&gt; know what the word 'galvanometer' means) may see a galvanometer in a
&gt; physics laboratory, but cannot see that there is a galvanometer
&gt; there.

&gt;  Seeing-that is propositional and
&gt;  requires that the observer possesses
&gt;  the words or concepts needed to
&gt;  formulate the proposition in question.

&gt;  Seeing is not propositional and does
&gt;  not require the possession
&gt;  of any concept.

&gt; What makes seeing-that possible is the prior understanding of language
&gt; or concepts. It is language which enables us to see that (or more
&gt; generally, perceive that) things are the case, and hence to formulate
&gt; observation-statements.

&gt;  Now, the gap between experiences
&gt;  and observation reports, a gap filled
&gt;  by language or concepts, is an
&gt;  important source of the
&gt;  fallibility of observation
&gt;  reports.

&gt; We all see the table and do not hesitate to accept the observation
&gt; statement 'There is a table'. But what if someone were to fiddle
&gt; around at the back of the 'table' and all of a sudden Beethoven's
&gt; Fifth Symphony were to fill the room? Would we then be inclined to say
&gt; that we were wrong, that the object was not a table after all but a
&gt; rather swish and streamlined stereo? If we would say this, then in
&gt; reporting 'There is a table' we were tacitly committed to the
&gt; prediction that it would not emit Beethoven's Fifth. And because this
&gt; prediction turned out to be mistaken, we were prepared to give up the
&gt; observation report which committed us to it.

&gt; The point can be generalised.

&gt;  In attending to sensory stimuli
&gt;  and interpreting them in a certain
&gt;  way so as to formulate observation
&gt;  reports, we always employ words or
&gt;  concepts which commit us to certain
&gt;  predictions regarding our
&gt;  future experiences.

&gt;  Since any of these predictions might
&gt;  turn out to be mistaken, future
&gt;  experiences might always lead us
&gt;  to reject a past observation
&gt;  report.

&gt; This is what we mean by saying that any observation report transcends
&gt; the experience which prompts it and is therefore fallible.

&gt; How precisely does this transcendence come about? How can 'Here is a
&gt; table' commit us to any prediction? In our particular example, the
&gt; prediction actually arises not simply from the observation report but
&gt; from a general principle also, as follows:

&gt; Observation report:
&gt; Here is a table.

&gt; General principle:
&gt; Tables, unlike stereos, do not play music.

&gt; Prediction:
&gt; This object will not play music.

&gt; More generally, the structure of the predictive arguments is like
&gt; this:

&gt; Observation report:
&gt; A is an X.

&gt; General principle:
&gt; X's do/do not do Y.

&gt; Prediction:
&gt; A will/will not do Y.

&gt; Now the argument we have proposed says that since the predictions
&gt; might always be mistaken, we might always be led to reject our
&gt; observation report...

Kant claimed he just wanted to find out what we can know analytically

back to your thesis.

IDEALISM  [Bxxxv] Although Kant is himself a transcendental idealist
(and empirical realist), one of his main concern is to destroy
idealism--namely, dogmatic and problematic idealism, both of which
rest on (in Kant's view) bogus notion of transcendental realism--by
means of the critique of reason. Thus in the Preface to B he writes
&quot;criticism alone can sever the root of materialism, fatalism, atheism,
free-thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which can be injurious
universally; as well as of idealism and skepticism, which are
dangerous chiefly to the schools&quot; (in fact, he argues that the very
same transcendental illusions which help motivate idealism also
motivate materialism, fatalism, atheism, and moral free-thinking).
[A377] &quot;The dogmatic idealist would be one who denies the existence of
matter, the skeptical idealist one who doubts its existence, because
thinking it to be incapable of proof&quot;, while the transcendental
idealist adopts empirical realism and judges appearances as
empirically real objects according to the criteria &quot;whatever is
connected with a perception according to empirical laws, is actual&quot;.

The traditional &quot;refutation&quot; of idealism, (attributed to a &quot;Dr.
Johnson&quot; as a refutation of Bishop George Berkeley's version of
idealism) suggests that, to &quot;disprove&quot; idealism, all one has to do is
kick something (or someone). As if to say, &quot;oh, so you don't believe
in matter; then this shouldn't hurt a bit! But, herein lies the
problem. The only evidence sited for matter is &quot;experience.&quot;

Remember when Hume referred to both &quot;inward and outward sentiment?&quot; He
meant we have the experience of stuff going on inside of us and the
experience of stuff going of outside of us. Both are experiences!
Recall Kant's synthetic a priori knowledge--the 12 categories
including space and time, which filter the Noumena into Phenomena. It
is very similar here. In both cases there is &quot;something&quot; outside that
is then put into the minds structure and turned into an experience. In
both cases you can say that &quot;you are not reading this text&quot; and be
perfectly accurate! After Kant wrote his main book explaining how the
mind constructs our experience of the phenomenal realm, philosophers
began wondering what justification is there for the noumena? The
Idealists answer is, there can be no justification from experience.

http://commhum.mccneb.edu/dweber/101%20INTRO/Workbook/Chpt-3/3-2%20Id...

Refutation of Idealism - Kant argues that temporal judgments about
one's own states require reference to objects which endure in a way
that mental representations themselves do not, and therefore that
consciousness of oneself also implies consciousness of objects
external to oneself [B 275-6] also [B xxxix-xli].

http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/DB047SECT7

When the Critique of Pure Reason was first published Kant was
horrified when some critics took him to be proposing a form of
idealism not unlike, for example, Berkeley's notorious immaterialism.
On the face of it, it wouldn't be utterly silly, given the arguments
of the Aesthetic and Analytic, to suppose that Kant was claiming that
we construct the 'real world' in a way determined by the nature of our
sensory and intellectual apparatus, and that therefore there was
simply no such thing as the 'real world'. However Kant insists that
this is not what he is arguing, and in the second edition he adds a
short section, 'The Refutation of Idealism', where he argues against
what he calls material idealism and distinguishes it from
transcendental idealism. We're going to concentrate on how effective
this refutation of material idealism is.

No, you evade or avoid the point and resort to name calling and other

If I did what Heidegger suggested, and move away from ontology - which
is what I wanted to do - to a set of minimal metaphysical requirements
that offer a humanly recognizable metaphysics, then there is not going
to be any substantial differences as far as I can see. For a humanly
centred metaphysics still speaks of objects as independent of a human
centre. But more than than that - the claimed boundary between
ontology and human-centred metaphysics is really only contingent upon
local historical developments?

We have touched on some of his ideas about ontology already and I think,
by reading some of your recent posts, that you understand that
metaphysics, of the substance or thematic objectification kind, had been
faulty. Heidegger conceded that point in the 1920s. Yet he thought that
it was the job of science to do that. There are objective 'beings'
[things] studied in science. There are some related origins of these
things and science can study that. He called them the 'ontic' sciences.

Therefore, metaphysics ended but not ontology. 'Appearance' remained in
the world left unsaid, unspoken about in a scientific way. Phenomenology
was the science that would study 'appearance'. And the &quot;self-'I'&quot; was
the ROOT 'appearance' in the world. He applied the science of
phenomenology to ontology. He credited Husserl, Plato and Aristotle for
the idea. In Plato's &quot;Sophist&quot; the question about existence is asked:
story-tellers talk about 'being' as though it has objective origin born
out of other beings. But its too perplexing. So what is Being?

The difference between ontical
science which studies beings, and ontological science which studies
being is that ontology must define being.

For Heidegger, being is the self-constitution OR self-dissolution of the
&quot;self-I&quot; in the world. Virtualists, Buddhists, Cartesians, etc.
exemplify this. But none speak to the ontological science of it.

The constitution or dissolution of this root 'appearance' in the world
is called 'Dasein'. Heidegger thought it was also 'ontic' and therefore,
an 'entity'- because it was in the world. But its origins were too
perplex for property based ontic science alone. But Heidegger's idea of
what 'phenomenology' should be has evolved. Someone like Daniel Dennet
became more radical than Heidegger on the demarcation between the
ontical and ontological sciences. So today we see that 'phenomenology'
itself evolved to other forms like 'hetero-phenomenology&quot;.

This word 'phenomenology' is about the science of 'appearance' and
correlation in the world. The 'science' and the 'appearance' and the
'correlation' themselves appear, and can accommodate a radical view to
how it is that they become a matter of openness and disclosure. So
itself, as a science can shift.

OK. I understand all that. It ties in with some thoughts I put out

It ties in with Kant, my topic. The 'thing in itself'. How much

Dassein is tied up with it.

I do, I keep it linked with the best theory of reality I can concieve.
Simply because something is not determinable doesn't negate the value
that some things have in the past happened more or less than other
things in the past. From these kinds of memories we move forward with
confidence, belief or whatever you ant to call conviction.

The idea argument doesn't only serve ideas but also is an attempt to
explain what happens in the world and also these language instincts
probably have access to the parts of our brains whos activities are
emotion and subjectivity. These words are not to be only classified as
some game, they are connected to life.

David Hume qualified his own Scepticism by pointing out that to live
at all we have perpetually to make choices, decisions, and this forces
us to form judgements about the way things are, whether we like it or
not. Since certainty is not available to us we have to make the best
assessments we can of the realities we face - and this is incompatible
with regarding all alternatives with equal scepticism. Our Scepticism
therefore needs to be, as he put it, mitigated. It is indeed doubtful
whether anyone could live on the basis of complete Scepticism - or, if
they could, whether such a life would be worth living. But this
refutation of Scepticism, if refutation it is, is not a logical
argument.

In practical life we must steer a middle course between demanding a
degree of certainty that we can never have and treating all
possibilities as if they were of equal weight when they are not.

So there's a sub-discussion about (20th century) continental
philosophy going on here? This group isn't devoted to only the
historical pathways that led to (Anglo-American) analytical
philosophy? While this is happening, anyone want to comment or
elaborate on Ernst Tugendhat's statement below?

Ulrike Herrmann: &quot;You're always quoted as saying that the problem in
Heidegger is the absence of a concept of untruth.&quot;

Ernst Tugendhat: &quot;He developed a concept of truth, the concept of
'unconcealment', to which the contrast of falsehood no longer
essentially belonged. Things are relatively complicated in his
philosophy. He always had ways of talking his way out. But in
principle the critical dimension was lost.&quot;

Yes, indeed. Your term 'framework' seems a good word choice. It is
structural and constitutional. When I read your posts about framework I
thought about Heidegger's use of 'limit' and 'delimit' in an
ontical/ontological way. Those terms tie in with time. But then I
thought about your use of 'framework' as energy. Will you expand on this
topic? It might make interesting reading on AP.

">

For Heidegger, the 'thing in itself' was ontologically inappropriate
Being. In a radical effort to show this Heidegger merely exposed Kant's
thesis about what 'Being' was when employing the 'thing in itself''
method.

First: he applied the 'TiI' method to the primordial idea of
consciousness as: 'consciousness in itself'. That was the Kantian
ontological proposition. It led to an inappropriate conclusion:
'consciousness' was limited and structure-less. There was a regressive
manifestation of Being in Kantian thought. The structure of
'consciousness in' led to another structure of 'consciousness in', then
another, and so on. Wholism was absent in such a strictly subjective
method. The 'intentional' stance held in phenomenology was that
'consciousness' cannot be conscious of itself. That was the wholism
Heidegger posited.

Consciousness, if it is, is 'consciousness of something'. Therefore, the
primordial 'consciousness in itself' would have been inappropriate
ontology, inappropriate presupposition. Heidegger stated the
presuppostional case for primordial 'self-I'. Refer to his work for
that.

Second: If the question of Being was to be asked ontically, it became
more appropriate to use Husserl's ontological conclusion: &quot;THINGS
THEMSELVES&quot;.

Here the phenomenological method held: 'consciousness' themselves' [and
'they-self'] delimited the Kantian conclusion of subjectivity. Any
possible structure of 'in itself-ness' as a presupposition is
inappropriate. 'Delimitations' toward a world was structured in Dasein.
Heidegger took this to its ontological conclusion and made the case for
Dasein as wholism Being in the world.

Furthermore, Kant's 'thing in itself' was unrelated to the world in its
cognitive proposition- the 'I think'. Its subjectivism was somehow
clinging to representations.
Heidegger again showed the inappropriate and absent Kantian proposition:
'I think' was cut off. More appropriately, stated the proposition
Heidegger stated was: &quot;I think something&quot;. That 'something' was tied to
entities in the world by 'being at hand' and in Dasein's 'care'.

For the actual source of this and the full integration of the
Heidegger's ontic/ontological thesis, see &quot;Being and Time&quot; CIII,

">

Heidegger's principle methodology toward 'unconcealment' was a radical
approach: an appeal to the 'hermeneutical shift'. That style of
'aletheia' was a 're-circuiting of thinking', and not fallacious
'circular reasoning'. Heidegger anticipated his critics confusing the
two. Tugendhat is correct because Heidegger admitted it indirectly- a
re-circuit of thinking did not have a clear start. It had a 'clearing'.
Clear the 'ground' and jump in. So falsehoods were not sought after at
the outset.

Heidegger was pulling out Aristotle's book &quot;On Interpretations&quot; over the
ancient philosopher's law of excluded middles. But he insisted on all
true propositions in science. So that it, along with wholism, was the
approach. Heidegger thought Being to perplexed to define straight out-
ontology necessitated wholism. And wholism, in general, had a common
sense incompatibility with LEM.

Common sense thinking, the path to drive-by truth and falsehood, and
complex excluded middles, was hard to incorporate for wholism:
Wittgenstein debated Turing on that very topic. There is a published
text of the debate. W stated 'yes' and 'no' statements were compatable.
T argued against it.

I recall, hopefully correctly, that Wittgenstein also defended thay
position in his &quot;T L-Investigations&quot; when he wrote about 'above' and
'below' as something the LEM could not work out. And one other point
about alethic interpretation excluding LEM, is in a trial by jury
involving cross, re-cross, and re-direct examination of a material
witness who made more seemingly contradictory statements as a more
inclusive testimony develops to perplex the jurors.

That is not to say that Heidegger is off the hook. Today, American
continental thought has made categorial thinking necessary in the
application of the Phenomenological Method.

As for Heidegger's critical principles, he practiced it rather than
preached it. He used 'research' and 'deconstruction'. There Plato gets
credit. R&amp;D is right out of &quot;Republic&quot;. [allegory of the cave]. My last
response to JJ showed that Kant was taken up and examined critically.
Heidegger gave most issues a 'research' and a 'deconstruction'. Still,
that was something quite different from a critical 'dialectical
discourse'.

Since the best theory shows evidence that makes it probable that all
human languages are translatable to other human languages, ths based
upon the genes which direct the assembly of the language portions of
the brain. There is no clear metaphor that you can provide which would
make a convincing case for the argument that something communicable in
one language is not communicable in another language, this except for
differing degrees of detail in particular subjects.

...from a Martian's-eye-view, all humans speak a single language is
based on the discovery that the same symbol- manipulating machinery,
underlies the world's languages. Universal Grammar is like an
archetypal body plan found across vast numbers of animals in a phylum
(238-9), a common plan of syntactic, morphological, and phonological
rules and principles, with a small set of varying parameters. Once
set, a parameter can produce far-reaching changes in the superficial
appearance of the language. One of the most intriguing discoveries is
that there appears to be a common anatomy in all phrases in all the
world's languages. Phrase structure is the kind of stuff language is
made of; traces, cases, X-bars, and the other paraphernalia of syntax
are colourless, odourless, and tasteless, but they, or something like
them, must be a part of our unconscious mental life (124). The
universal plan underlying languages, with auxiliaries and inversion
rules, nouns and verbs, subjects and objects, phrases and clauses,
cases and agreement, and so on, seem to suggest a commonality in the
brains of speakers, because many other plans would have been just as
useful (43).

3.2 Chomsky and the acquisition of language by children

Children must innately be equipped with a plan common to the grammars
of all language, a Universal Grammar, that tells them how to distil
the syntactic patterns out of the speech of their parents. The
unordered super-rules (principles) are universal and innate; when
children learn a particular language, they do not have to learn a long
list of rules, because they are born knowing the super-rules (112).
All they have to learn is whether their particular language has the
parameter head-first, as in English, or head-last, as in Japanese. If
the verb comes before the object, the child concludes that the
language is head-first as if the child were merely flipping a switch
to one of two possible positions. The way language works is that each
person's brain contains a lexicon of words and the concepts they stand
for (a mental dictionary) and a set of rules that combine the words to
convey relationships among concepts (a mental grammar) (85).

Pinker suggests that language should be considered as an evolutionary
adaptation like the eye, its major parts designed to carry out
important functions. Chomsky speaks about the 'language organ' and
language is assumed to be a distinct brain module. The evolution of
the eye was a central debating point between proponents and opponents
of Darwinian natural selection; Darwin himself offered a gradualistic
account which has been taken up and refined many times, most notably
recently by Richard Dawkins (1986). A plausible account has been given
of how even a rudimentary eye could be selected and increase the
fitness of the individual in whom the advance took place; each small
improvement in the functioning of the eye would promote survival of
the individual and the individual's offspring carrying the gene for
the improved eye. Maynard Smith and Szathmary in their recent The
Major Transitions in Evolution (1995) also pick up the analogy between
development of the eye and the development of language. This is
perhaps not surprising since admittedly they relied heavily on two
sources, Bickerton's (1990) book and Pinker and Bloom's 1990 article
which foreshadowed The Language Instinct.

3.4.2 The analogy with the evolution of instincts

Language is a distinct piece of the biological makeup of the brain
(18). The universality of complex language is the first reason to
suspect that language is the product of a special human instinct. If
language is an instinct, it should have an identifiable seat in the
brain, and perhaps even a special set of genes that help wire it into
place (45-46). If language is like other instincts, presumably it
evolved by natural selection, the only successful scientific
explanation of complex biological traits (354), the only alternative
(Pinker's emphasis) that can explain the evolution of a complex organ
like the eye or like language. Each step in the evolution of a
language instinct, up to and including the most recent ones, must
enhance fitness (366- 367), the gradual accumulation over generations
of random genetic mutations that increase reproductive success (333).
The language instinct is composed of many parts: syntax, with its
discrete combinatorial system building phrase structures; morphology,
a second combinatorial system building words, a capacious lexicon; a
revamped vocal tract; phonological rules and structures; speech
perception; parsing algorithms, learning algorithms (362).

Probability shall be sustained until your position negates the
possibility that we are trapped with inductive theories. We must make
a choice an desist from wimpering about the loss of presumed certainty
because of older philosophies and science.

David Hume qualified his own Scepticism by pointing out that to live
at all we have perpetually to make choices, decisions, and this forces
us to form judgements about the way things are, whether we like it or
not. Since certainty is not available to us we have to make the best
assessments we can of the realities we face - and this is incompatible
with regarding all alternatives with equal scepticism. Our Scepticism
therefore needs to be, as he put it, mitigated. It is indeed doubtful
whether anyone could live on the basis of complete Scepticism - or, if
they could, whether such a life would be worth living. But this
refutation of Scepticism, if refutation it is, is not a logical
argument.

In practical life we must steer a middle course between demanding a
degree of certainty that we can never have and treating all
possibilities as if they were of equal weight when they are not.
