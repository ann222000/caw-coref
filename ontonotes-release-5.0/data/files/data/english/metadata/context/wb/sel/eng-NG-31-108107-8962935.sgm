Once again alison, try to figger it out. Puttin the kat down

A scat mat directly in front of the door, can be stepped
OVER by the humans, but teach the cat to avoid the door area.

I think it's a great solution.

BTW they can run on a 9V battery, so no wires are needed.

They are fixtures on my leather furniture to stop kitties
from peeing there!

Just another opinion that Scat Mats are pretty useful tools.

Rather than have my youngest cat continue to ruin my
leather furniture, we have Scat Mats on the sofa and
chair.

When they are off, and we're sitting on that furniture,
Skip is allowed on and in our laps, etc.  When the mats
are on, I can be happy with the fact that he's not
urinating on the leather!

The static charge isn't much at all - it's a deterrent,

Subject: diagnosis frustration

Even when the answers are bad, I like ANSWERS.  Where my little
Carey-kitty is involved, we never seem to have any.  She's been
&quot;sick&quot; for the last 3 years and we've never been able to figure
out just what's going on with her.  I'm trying to not add up the
costs, as they just keep mounting.

Carey is an almost 12 year old tortie with numerous problems over
the 3 years, related to behavior, urinary issues, weight loss, and
early on, paralysis as well.  We've had tests out the wazoo, have
seen standard general practice vets as well as a neurologist, tried
various medications, and we still have no real answers.

I'm hoping those come soon, but the preliminary aren't great choices.

After raising her Elavil level to combat inappropriate urination, she
tore her ACL.  That appears to be healing slowly.  She's been at the
vet numerous times in the last few weeks and we started seeing a
different vet, closer to home this week.

That was after she projectile vomited 2 meals, and was passing bloody
urine, on Monday.  After a few small puddles of that, her urine was
not bloody and she was back to eating without problem.  All day
Tuesday was fine.  Saw vet on Wednesday, and x-rayed her bladder, and
embarked on more tests (last full bloodwork was last August).  She has
a HUGE palpable thyroid gland, yet her thyroid tests (free T-4 still
waiting) have all been normal.  She weighs 7# and is skin and bones,
and has been for quite a long time.  She eats well (1 full can of
Trader Joe's cat food and 1/2 can Fancy Feast daily) and plays with
the other cat, loves on the dogs, etc.

5 minutes after coming home from the vet on Wednesday, she squatted
on the floor and let loose a large puddle of bloody urine.  No blood
in urine since.  Her urinalysis shows no issues.

Her kidneys look fine on x-rays, but her test results show renal
insufficiency, but not failure.

We're still waiting for more test results, but so far,
we have no answers.  Does anyone have any thoughts?

Thanks.  Unfortunately, that's what my vet has said as well.
Having dealt with it with a few pets now, it didn't hit me
quite like the ton of bricks as the first time I heard that
diagnosis, but it still is hard to hear that it's a potential.

The last 2 days, she's been galloping and eating and acting
like &quot;hey - I'm ok - no problem - don't worry about me!&quot;.

She's a tough little cat, but obviously not a well one.

She's adored by all beings in this household, so we'll do
whatever we need to for her as we find out (or not) more.
Right now she's curled up with her kitty-&quot;brother&quot; and
seems happy as she can be.

Even when the answers are bad, I like ANSWERS.  Where my little
Carey-kitty is involved, we never seem to have any.  She's been &quot;sick&quot;
for the last 3 years and we've never been able to figure out just
what's going on with her.  I'm trying to not add up the costs, as they
just keep mounting.

Carey is an almost 12 year old tortie with numerous problems over the
3 years, related to behavior, urinary issues, weight loss, and early
on, paralysis as well.  We've had tests out the wazoo, have seen
standard general practice vets as well as a neurologist, tried various
medications, and we still have no real answers.

I'm hoping those come soon, but the preliminary aren't great choices.

After raising her Elavil level to combat inappropriate urination, she
tore her ACL.  That appears to be healing slowly.  She's been at the
vet numerous times in the last few weeks and we started seeing a
different vet, closer to home this week.

That was after she projectile vomited 2 meals, and was passing bloody
urine, on Monday.  After a few small puddles of that, her urine was
not bloody and she was back to eating without problem.  All day
Tuesday was fine.  Saw vet on Wednesday, and x-rayed her bladder, and
embarked on more tests (last full bloodwork was last August).  She has
a HUGE palpable thyroid gland, yet her thyroid tests (free T-4 still
waiting) have all been normal.  She weighs 7# and is skin and bones,
and has been for quite a long time.  She eats well (1 full can of
Trader Joe's cat food and 1/2 can Fancy Feast daily) and plays with
the other cat, loves on the dogs, etc.

5 minutes after coming home from the vet on Wednesday, she squatted on
the floor and let loose a large puddle of bloody urine.  No blood in
urine since.  Her urinalysis shows no issues.

Her kidneys look fine on x-rays, but her test results show renal
insufficiency, but not failure.

We're still waiting for more test results, but so far, we have no
answers.  Does anyone have any thoughts?

Thanks.  Unfortunately, that's what my vet has said as well.
Having dealt with it with a few pets now, it didn't hit me
quite like the ton of bricks as the first time I heard that
diagnosis, but it still is hard to hear that it's a potential.

The last 2 days, she's been galloping and eating and acting
like &quot;hey - I'm ok - no problem - don't worry about me!&quot;.

She's a tough little cat, but obviously not a well one.

She's adored by all beings in this household, so we'll do
whatever we need to for her as we find out (or not) more.
Right now she's curled up with her kitty-&quot;brother&quot; and
seems happy as she can be.

A scat mat directly in front of the door, can be stepped

I fully understand that (and the analogy of other groups
who feel strongly about issue &quot;x&quot;).  I think there is a
very, very large group of people who choose or think about
declawing, do so not because they want to take a chance
that the animal they love may be tortured, but because
of a variety of experiences/advice that says it's an ok
thing to do (not torture in general - declawing!).

Take the neighbor's attitude (&quot;just&quot; a cat?  NO cat is
&quot;just&quot; anything! ;-D). One shared by many, to some degree.
Lot's of priorities.  Interesting thread on RPDB recently
about people willing to die/put themselves in the line of
fire for their dogs.

It was interesting to read the range of thoughts on such
a thing.  Obviously, people give different weight to
different beings and things.

While I am their caregiver and friend, I don't put
pets in the same category as humans.

I declawed my first cat, because my experiences said that
is what you did with an indoor cat (had lived with many
cats owned by others).  She used her claws inappropriately
as a kitten, and my meager attempts at clawing devices
didn't work, so I thought nothing of it.

Since she exhibited no obvious ill effects, my experience
(and hers as far as anyone could tell) was a positive one.

Knowing more of what it entailed, I chose not to declaw my
next cat (owned in tandem with cat #1 and then cat #3).
He was an adult acquisition and I knew such a thing would
be more difficult for him, but also, he was very trainable
and I didn't even consider it.

Cat #3 was a claw maniac, and due to my experiences with
Cat #1, I went ahead with a declaw.  Once again, I have
never seen any backlashes due to the operation, and I
