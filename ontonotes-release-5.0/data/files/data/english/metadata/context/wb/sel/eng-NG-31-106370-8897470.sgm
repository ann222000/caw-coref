It looks like there is a company that specializes in expungement; they
claim to be able to remove charges from your criminal record:
http://www.clearmyrecord.com

Says they can remove charges from your record for a flat rate; offers
free consultation.  Couldn't hurt to ask, I guess, so I was wondering--
has anyone had any experience with expungement?  Does this company
offer what they claim (totally removing old charges from a criminal
record so that future employers etc can't find them by doing a
background check)?  Any help or input at all would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

Mitchell.

What the web site actually suggests is not that a company which
&quot;specializes in expungement&quot; and, instead, specializes in charging
fees to help an applicant learn a summary of (so-called) &quot;expungement&quot;
or criminal record &quot;sealing&quot; or related relief laws at the U.S. state
and federal level and, for a fee( (initially, &quot;only [sic] $400&quot;),
purporting to assist in requesting whatever (if any) such or like
relief seems not clearly out of reach while at the same time
disclaiming that expungement (or anything close) will be granted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; they claim to be able to remove charges from

What they actually claim is that they offer a &quot;consultation&quot; with a
view towards trying to determine whether the would be applicant
possibly is eligible for what is referred to as &quot;expungement&quot; or some
other lesser relief then, for a fee, putatively assisting in applying
for some version of that or lesser relief, although, even then, on
condition that the applicant confirm that s/he understands and agrees
that there are no &quot;guarantees&quot; since that operation does not promise
any particular result because it basically is &quot;a forms processing
company only&quot; which does not have any authority relating to the grant
or denial of any customer's application for relief.

Again, this is not what it claims.  Read more carefully.  Not
incidentally, real &quot;expungement&quot; has been essentially no longer
available (at least not to ordinary mortals) anywhere in the U.S.
since the institution and implementation of the federal/state
cooperatively run NCIC system, although some states provide
(limited/qualified) related relief, such as sealing of records or the
like, for eligible persons (unfortunately, sometimes referred to
misleadingly as &quot;expungement&quot;).
