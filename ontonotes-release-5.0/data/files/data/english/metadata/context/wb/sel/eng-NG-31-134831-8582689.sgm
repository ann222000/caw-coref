Sony has applied for a patent to hitch its DualShock or SIXAXIS controllers
to the PSP as a sort of dock, allowing for wired or even wireless control of
the PSP. Of course, dual analog control won't be much help on most PSP
games, but gamers will be able to enjoy that downloadable PSX content as it
was originally intended. That is, of course, if this harebrained scheme ever
makes it to market.

Do you know when this was filed? It looks as though they used the PSP-1000
in the patent and, I believe, a PS2 controller. The PS3 controllers have a
circular menu (Home/PS) button just below the Start and Select buttons.
Although it is hard to to be sure from this diagram if this is the SIXAXIS
controller or not.

And yes, the circular menu button is identical to and
clearly...ahem...inspired by the 360's circular menu button.

That being said, I would like to put up one of the new PSP-2000s (PSP Lite?)
when they drop. This would be pretty cool, especially since the new PSPs
have the video/audio out cables.

if the psp is becoming less N less portable each day.

they want some kind of Wii-like controller to go with their ps3. the sixaxis
concept is cool right now. but to now use the psp to play ps1 or psp games
on your home television AND by using the sixaxis controller would be a good
look
