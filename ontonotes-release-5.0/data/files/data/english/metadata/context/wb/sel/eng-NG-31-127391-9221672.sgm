I'm trying to understand lamp efficiency, such as in a discharge lamp;
So, if I have an arc lamp, say an HTI lamp, then am I correct that:
PowerIn-PowerOut = 0, and the PowerIn is a 100% EMF and
the PowerOut is Thermal energy + the kinetic energy of all the photons
produced.

If one could create a lamp that could withstand the heat, that was
insulated, and had a dichroic port that reflected all unwanted wavelengths
back into the lamp, could it be possible to convert 100% of the inputted
energy to outputted light?  If the heat that normally is produced is kept
inside that lamp, will that thermal energy eventually get converted to
photon?  Is it a matter of the heat is getting out before it gets converted?
Is there some theoretical limit to how much electrical energy gets converted
to photons?  Why not create a lamp that is 100% internally reflective except
for its output port (kind of a thermal laser?)

It just seems to me that arc lamps pushout so much energy as heat...and what
if it could get harvested and put back into the lamp?
thanks

Not sure what you mean by EMF in this context, and I'm not
sure I would classify photon energy as kinetic, but the
answer is basically yes.

YES.  And the lamp doesn't even have to be designed for
higher temperature - just reduce the power input to
compensate for the trapped energy.  This is the way that
IR-reflector incandescent lamps work.  Their IR reflectors
are less than 5% efficient, but this is enough to almost
double the efficacy of the lamp.

If you have an ideal reflector that does not absorb ANY
energy itself and allows ONLY visible light to escape then
conservation of energy requires that your assumption is
correct.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not exactly.   No conversion process is 100% efficient. Some
energy is also lost in the process in the real world.

Because we don't have materials that are 100% efficient.
each step in the process has some losses and they all add up
to a significant amount.

There are a number of patents on this idea, but a gas
discharge does not absorb reflected energy as easily as a
tungsten filament.  At  many IR wavelengths the gas is
optically thin, so the IR must be reflected many times from
the reflector before it gets absorbed by the gas, and at
each reflection there is some loss in the reflector. Nature
does not make life easy.
