Folks, my doctor has told me my blood pressure is too high, this is no
surprise since
I've been gaining weight, and since I've been feeling shitty since
June, partly
due to total work overload and partly not being able to sleep without
waking up 3-4
times each night due to aches and pains I got at work, etc.
I have decided to do something about it and to be NICE to MYSELF.

What does this have to do with HLAS?

HLAS is like a stage or one of Shakespeare's forests or castles and in
it are
wise men and women and strange fabled creatures. We have Mr.
Neuendorffer the walking
encyclopedia for example. One of the latest arrivals is lackpurity who
is much into meditation and reincarnation etc. And me of course
posting off-topic ALL the time.

But all these people make HLAS a really colourful place, I think. I've
been posting
here for SIX years...which is a long time, and it's always interesting
to come back
to HLAS.

So, whoever you are out there, don't take criticism to heart. Think of
your blood
pressure. We like to do a bit of jousting on HLAS, but we don't want
the wounds
we inflict to go too deep.

On another group I wrote that I think Turkey must stay out of the EU,
and a guy told
me I was a stupid English bastard. I replied that I at least know who
my
biological father is. It was a to a Turk. He'll be furious. I was
laughing when
I read his post, laughing even harder when I wrote my reply.

You see, that's what HLAS is also good for. You learn to dish it out,
BUT
you also learn to take it with humour.

Why did I write this post? Guys, HLAS is a fun place to be AND
intellectually
quite stimulating. Don't get upset. Have fun.
Think of your blood pressure.

Would Elizabethans use blood letting for treatment of high blood
pressure?  I don't know, but here's some stuff quoted from an Internet
source on Elizabethan humours.

Looking at this makes me think that the Eastern idea of acupuncture
might be the way to go.  Or just change jobs and get something that
keeps you physically active.  Unfortunately, working on the PC doesn't
do that.  bookburn

The Basics
The four humours were literally bodily fluids, but were associated
with personality traits, which is why we still talk about someone
being “good-humoured.”  Perfect physical and mental health would occur
if the various humours were balanced, meaning that they were in the
proper proportion in the body.  However, no one was ever thought to be
perfectly balanced.  Minor imbalances were associated with personality
traits, whereas severe imbalances led to bodily illnesses and
personality disorders.  An excess of a humour could be treated by
decreasing the amount of that humour in the system, for example by
bleeding, diuretics, laxatives, or enemas.

Connections
This table shows some of the associations given to the humours

Humour: Blood Phlegm or Pituita Yellow Bile Black Bile
Character Type:  Sanguine Phlegmatic Choleric Melancholic
Element: Air Water Fire Earth
Planet: (or luminary) Jupiter Moon Mars Saturn
Astrological Signs: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces
Aries, Leo, Sagittarius Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
Wind/Direction: South East West North
Temperature/Moisture:  Hot and Moist Cold and Moist Hot and Dry Cold
and Dry
Season: Spring Winter Summer Autumn

Phase of Life: Adolescence Childhood (also senility) Adulthood Old Age
Appearance: Large-framed, with a pink or red complexion Fleshy and
fair Slim, wiry, red-haired Slim, fair, not muscular
Appearance, if out of balance: Fat, with a florid complexion; Fat and
pale; Thin, color rises when angry; Thin, pale
Character Traits: Optimistic, cheerful, fun-loving, generous, amorous
Emotional: mild, passive, sensitive, intuitive Ambitious, energetic,
direct Thoughtful, introspective, reflective
Character Traits: if out of balance: Irresponsible, gluttonous,
inebriate, lusty Lazy, vulnerable, cowardly, excessively emotional
Violent, hot-tempered, unscrupulous, vengeful; Depressive,
narcissistic, self-loathing

Yellow bile: includes gall and urine; think of how we associate an
easily annoyed or angered character as being “pissed-off” or “pissy.”
Black bile: includes feces, but also clotted blood.
Note that combination characters also exist.  For example, someone can
be choleric-melancholic, or sanguine-choleric, etc.  In each case,
that person would combine the qualities of both humours.

Shakespeare’s Characters
Many of Shakespeare’s characters recognizably represent a specific
humour.  Falstaff is the most famous sanguine character in literature.
Hamlet, of course, is the melancholy Dane.  Laertes is obviously
choleric, while he associates his sister Ophelia with “too much of
water” — suggesting she is phlegmatic.  After the play within the
play, Guildenstern tells Hamlet the King “Is in his retirement
marvelous distempered.”  Hamlet asks, “With drink?” (clearly playing
dumb in order to make a pointed insult about Claudius), and
Guildenstern replies, “No, my lord, with choler.” Hamlet then suggests
Guildenstern should be giving this information to the king’s doctor,
“for for me to put him to his purgation would no doubt plunge him into
more choler”  (III.ii.327-34).

You know, I was talking to my husband about paintings and artists of
all kinds who suffered and endured all kinds of hardships just to
produce their art because it was a vocation and not just or not at all
a way to earn a living, and indeed, when I'm feeling bad, healthwise,
I pull myself up out of the depths of gloom by telling myself I have
to
finish this story, or write that book, or make that film, or get such
and
such a part, and it works, because that's me, what I live for.

BUT - fun is enjoyment, pleasure, laughter. So it (art) must be also
fun
and not all grim effort.

I don't think FUN is superficial, actually. But then I'm probably
misinterpreting the word. When one has ones nose to the mill-stone
every day trying to earn ones living doing rather dull work because
the fascinating work doesn't pay (yet) or one isn't in the right
location etc. to get such work, then FUN is a rare emotion.

MM:
Understood.  Call it fun.  Call it love.  Call it bhakti.  It's the
same, IMO.  It's really a mixture of both, as you pointed out.  My
Master used to say that sometimes meditation is dry, but we wouldn't
want to give it up, either.  So, we are experiencing both.  Whether it
is meditating, writing a play, or doing the things that you mentioned,
I think it's about the same.

MM:
I think I agree with this, as it may have deep subconscious roots.
For example, the famous statements of Marlowe and Shakespeare, &quot;Now I
know your saw of might, whoever loved that loved not at first sight.&quot;
That type of love at first sight, obviously, has subconscious roots.
It's not just superficial enjoyment or fun.  It's deep.  It might even
be rooted in past associations centuries ago.
