Sometimes I download documents (pdf's) and notice there is often a
huge difference in the clarity.  Magazine text off torrent sites seems
to be hazy in comparison with most pdf's which are razor sharp.  Is it
because someone is manually scanning the magazines?

Also, with my PPC Mini at 1.25 ghz and 1 gb 333mhz ram, does anyone
think that that is too slow to be able to quickly flip through pdf
pages?  There seems to be a bit of a lag in getting to the next page.
Or should I use a different document reader besides Adobe Reader?

Try Preview, to compare performance to Reader. As for RAM, is yours C3?
I'd go with C2 (2-2-2) instead of C3, and max out the amount of RAM for
your machine.

Good luck!

Yes, some PDFs are just converted (poor quality) image scans rather than
a PDF of a real text/image document.

It depends.

You can scan for crisp type, and any pics on the page will look like
crap.

You can scan for picture quality, and accept fuzzy type.

Depends to a certain extent on the original, too. I have some
archival material from old county records that were scanned into .pdfs.
These suck pretty much no matter what happens since they are the 40s and
50s to begin with.

It's not the equipment so much as the resolution at which the image is scanned.

A lot depends on wha tthe person who converted it did. The best is to
make the quark or other document into a PDF directly, so the text
remains as text (font information) good at any size, and the images get
compressed (or not, as appropriate to the purpose of the pdf).

With the pro version of Acrobat it is possible to scan and convert the
text parts to font info too, but this is an arduous task and quite often
people will just leave it as a huge compressed image. This would explain
why some documents take ages to open and 'turn' pages. One way to see if
this is the case, is to click on the 'select text' tool and see if you
can select text. If not it is an image.

Yes, if the PDF is created from a high resolution scan. Of course it
could be left as an image format file without converting to PDF. To try
it I just saved a 300dpi image as a PDF in Graphicconverter and it held
its resolution.

Yep ... good old GraphicConverter ... it's so good I didn't begrudge

I like to scan at the highest resolution possible,
because usually the scanner manufacturer's software
is not the best tool for reducing to the resolution
and size I want to publish.

Especially if I have to use enhancement techniques

Thats not the only issue.

If you are in control of the compression algorithms, you can scan at
high res and keep[ juts what *you* need. Not what te scanner decsiude to
give you.

In absolute terms thats always going to be 'better' from a strict
position of having a cleaner image to start from. The downside is all in
the cost and power of the engine you need to do the processing, even if
you don't store it - it has to be stored SOMEWHERE, even on a temporary
basis.

It's *not* always of value. In some cases it can actually cause you
more work correcting a photo or give you a poorer image, for instance,
then if you had simply scanned it at a lower resolution.

And for text, you're not seriously suggesting that scanning at 4800
gives you a better result than scanning at 2400, are you? That's
ludicrous. I can think of only a few very special circumstances where
scanning text higher than 1200 makes any sense at all.

No.

It depends on what you want to do with the scanned image.

Before we continue this joyful back and forth, can you tell me how long
you've been in the business of producing and reproducing scanned
images, including photos, line art and text (both for direct
reproduction and for OCR)? I've been doing it since about 1988...

You?

No, 100 DPI is nowhere *near* enough for traditional offset printing,
considering how much you typically enlarge negative scans for final
print, and that you usually want to do professional color correction /
image enhancement on it before-hand. Think more in the 1200 to 3000 DPI
range.  ; )

I think this must be a typo! I'm not doing professional stuff but I
would have said 1200dpi as a strating point unless it's some enormous
format negative such as I've never seen before! I find 300 to 600dpi to

Well, the quality of your scan depends on a whole lot more than the dpi
you scan at! That's why there is such a range of price of scanners ...
not just because the higher price scanners can do higher resolution. It
also depends on the printer too ...

Oh yeah? Not in terms of detail resolution it doesn't.

One of the standard tests of a camera/lens/film is to photograph an
incresingly finer grid, until the individual lines can no longer be
distinguished, getting lost either in lens blur of negative grain size.

Now My lenses are, tho old, exceptionally good: I alays got lost in
grain. If the scanner can't see the grain, then its not as good as the
picture was, and that is pure DPI.

I know that a 35mm picture scanned at 2Mpx is a lot worse than the films
I use. 4Mpx is not bad, but still worse. 8Mpx is as good as the fast
films, but 16Mpx is needed to approach the correct quality for lower
speed films..

This equates to about 2000-4000 dpi at the *negative* size.

Blown up to an 8x6 or so, about a  6:1 blow up in linear terms, the
scanners can come down to around 350-700 sort of size.
My old scanner is a true 300/interpolated 600dpi thing. It's simply not
able to render the detail on even an 8x6 as well as the print shows up.

And completely useless on slides or negatives.

I keep thinking about getting a digital back for my lenses..but $1500
buys a lot of film and processing..

That's why there is such a range of price of scanners ...

Of course it does. dMax and dMin come into play, certainly. How is the

&quot;One of the standard tests&quot; ... indeed, one of. I am simply stating that
2 scanners scanning at the same dpi can produce hugely different
qualities of scan. It is an undeniable fact. Shadows, detail, colour
accuracy, tinted greys, all can vary.

&gt; &quot;One of the standard tests&quot; ... indeed, one of. I am simply stating that
&gt; 2 scanners scanning at the same dpi can produce hugely different
&gt; qualities of scan. It is an undeniable fact. Shadows, detail, colour
&gt; accuracy, tinted greys, all can vary.

As can focus across the scanning bed...

But it's quite evident that TNP is pretending to know more about
scanning and scanners than s/he actually knows.

Well, when you said that the scanned photo wasn't as good as the
original prints I naturally presumed that you were comparing print to
print. If you are comparing original print to screen view then you are
not comparing like with like. In that instance I would also comment that
the viewed result would also depend on the monitor.

Oh get a life. You can enrage the screen image to the point where the
screen is a few pixels of the scanned image.

The monitor/grapics card is no bar to examining the image *resolution*.

Ideally you want a pixel at or below the photo grain size.

for a naked negative scan this is around 16 Mpx for a 35mm scan. Which
is why top end digital cameras work around that sort of resolution.

We have already proved that only you are guilty of that.

I know what I know, which isn't everything, but is a lot more than you
seem to.

The original questoin was 'whether all other things being equal, higher
es. scanning is always better'.

I pointed out that in my experience, yes it is, but all other things are
not equal: higher resolution scanning comes at a price - a real money
price, and a time penalty.

Now this eejit comes along and says things like it all depends on my
printer,which I never mentioned, my monitor and graphics set up, which
as I have shown is not relevant either *to the point I was making*.

Which was that to get ALL the detail of a photo, taken at or around
35mm, you need a 16Mpx or better frame size, which equates with a
negative or slide scan to an alarmingly high DPI ratio, around 4000dpi
plus, and even when blown up to 8x6, better than 600dpi.

Of course issues like the scanners color rendition and so on are
relevant to the job of doing a decent job, but that wasn't the issue.
That was a 'look at how clever I am' sidetrack by him.

The situation is more extreme when you want to scan microfilm, which is
put on extremely fine grained material  of a very small size.

And example I put up to the guy who said that 'to scan text there is a
point beyond which you simply don't need to go' and I replied 'it
depends on the size of the text'

In every case you have someone with narrow experience claiming things in
the general case. This seems to be a feature of Macophiles.

&quot;It works for me: If it doesn't work for you it's because what you are
doing is wrong, useless, doesn't need to be done or you shouldn't be
here in the first case.&quot;

Or the other habit: when faced with a clearly specified issue, evade it
and talk about something else.

Or in your case run out of ideas altogether and launch personal attacks,
which I am quit happy to match you on post for post.

As it happens I have done quiet a fair bit of scanning, and I did do a
considerable amount of research as I have an archive of WWII black and
white photo negatives taken by my late father, and want to get them into
decent format as they are of minor historical interest.

I have also attempted to read microfilm data sheets with the naked eye,
and believe me its hard going.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes I download documents (pdf's) and notice there is often a

&gt;&gt;&gt; because someone is manually scanning the magazines?

&gt;&gt; Yes, some PDFs are just converted (poor quality) image scans rather than
&gt;&gt; a PDF of a real text/image document.

&gt; Thanks Adrian.  But just to clarify, does that mean that its still

It depends on what you're doing with the pic. If you're printing to
newsprint, you can scan at 150 dpi and no-one will notice. (Newsprint really
sucks. You can see the pixels with the naked eye...) If you're printing to
glossy paper and scan at less than 300, everyone will notice. Scan at less
than 600, and a lot of people will notice. Scanning at higher dpi will give,
in general, better output on glossy paper. Overdoing it will generate a
Really Big File(tm) which takes forever to print and which will result in
output that a very few people will notice as superiour.... and most won't
notice anything special about it at all.

If you're going to OCR a file, 200 dpi is the flat minimum; less than that,
and you're introducing scanning errors into the bit stream being OCRed, which
will make for more OCR errors, and OCR apps make enough errors as it is,
thanks. 600 dpi is overkill; at that level, you're picking up creases and
wrinkles and dots on the page, which introduce scanning errors into the bit
stream...

For screen output (such as, at last, a .PDF) it'd help to know if the users
ever plan on printing it, and if so, if they're using a home/office printer
or a press. If they never intend printing it, knowing what size monitor
they'll be using to view it is nice. A small image scanned at high res can be
blown up; a large image scanned at low res can be shrunk, all without
sacrificing viewability. A small image scanned at low res is hopeless. You
can't scale it up, you'll see the pixels and the image will be useless. You
can't print it, your printer will print lots and lots of jaggies unless you
Photshop the hell out of that image, and even then there's a limit to what
you can do. A large image scanned at high res is simply a waste of time; you
have a humungus file, which took a long time to generate, and takes a while
to open even on high-end machines, so that you have to down-sample it
(wasting more time) to get any use out of it.

What I used to do was to scan in images at a fairly high res (1000 to 1500
dpi, depending on the scanner and the item being scanned) and save it in a
non-lossy or low-lossy format, such as TIFF, PSD, or PNG. I'd then make
copies in different formats depending on what the target was. (Newsprint got
200 dpi JPGs or TIFFs. OCR got 200 or 300 dpi JPGs. Glossy got 600 to 1200
dpi PDFs or PNGs or PSDs or TIFFs. Screen usually got what glossy got, only
usually PDF instead of the others, as it's like real difficult to get
multi-page PNGs, PSDs, and TIFFs. If size mattered more than output quality,
I usually generated a 150 dpi JPG or PDF.)
