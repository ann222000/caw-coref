They won't let ROTC on campus because they feel the militarys don't
ask don't tell policy is discriminatory. Yet they let the coward bitch
of Iran talk while his regime simply jails and kills gays. But watch
the so called tolerant liberals defend this guy and Colombia to the
world. Remember this is the same school that allowed LaRaza to speak
for 1 1/2 hours then ran the Minute men off the stage with no voice,
no tolerance,

The president of the university just spent 20 minutes cutting the
president of iran a new rectal opening. He used a chainsaw. I doubt the
little dictator ever heard anything like it before.

As for the ROTC denial, all the military has to do is get over its
idiotic sexual preference discrimination.

The so-called &quot;Minutemen&quot; movement has been exposed for what it is, a
pack of mostly white, racist, vigilantes.

So, if Columbia allows the Iranian pres to visit, why not allow the
head of the Minutemen?  This seems a little  (ok, a lot)
hypocritical.  Columbia does not seem to value free speech so as it
values allowing anti-USA voices.  I have no objection to listening to
this nutjob but INVITING him when they would not allow the Minutmen
head to speak and have not invited him back is totally at odds with
any notion of free speech.  Why not invite David Duke?  This is
nothing but liberal hypocrisy ( a virtue among them) at its most
obvious.  They do not allow ROTC but they INVITE someone who executes
gays and stones women to death, only a liberal would think that is
reasonable.

Columbia did allow the Minutemen to come to the Campus.  A few stupid
kids rushed the stage to disrupt the speech.  These kids were  chastised
(I think they were given some sort of punishment for their behavior) by
the college administration.  The administration used the Minutemen
fiasco as an opportunity to emphasize the importance of free speech, and
that includes allowing those you disagree.

Harry cannot find any way to defend the hypocrisy.  In fact, following
the logic of Columbia, if the US military started executing gays (as
does Iran) ROTC would be invited to Columbia.
Columbia HAS NOT invited the Minutemen back, so much for freedom of
speech there.

&gt;&gt; Gilchrist lost control of his pack of racist vigilantes. Is he back in

&gt; Harry cannot find any way to defend the hypocrisy.  In fact, following

&gt; Columbia HAS NOT invited the Minutemen back, so much for freedom of

I thought the twenty minute lecture (sermon) given to the students was
quite funny. It was very interesting to learn that there are absolutely
*no* homosexuals in Iran. Mr. A picked up some heavy 'boos' with that
statement. Obviously there's no sexual preference discrimination in Iran!

Humans are the worst animals on the planet:
http://youtube.com/watch?v=ybZ1YLYfYVI

Religion is the worst form of child abuse.  Those kids in the video have
been brainwashed by their religion from birth to throw those stones.
Professor Richard Dawkins is dead-on right in this respect.  America is
no different.  There are brainwashing schools across the country doing
the same thing to keep the religious bureaucracy's money rolling
in....perpetually.

Over 5000 humans are murdered every day by one religion or another &quot;in
the name of God&quot;.  Humans are the only self-destructive creatures on the
planet and are doing a very good job at it.

What pisses me off is the warning not to let young people watch these
atrocities.  Why?  They watch atrocities all across cable TV and are
taught religious atrocities at their schools.  What's the difference?
They play video games that are 90% committing atrocities....murders,
maiming, etc.

They don't want the young to watch because they have not completed their
religious indoctrination, yet, and they might turn away while they can
still think for themselves and stop it.

I want to show this video, in its entirety, across every cable and
broadcast TV channel in the country...Tonight at 8PM, without warning,
especially at Columbia U....

Bosnia-Serbs, Al Arish 1000 Egyptian POWs dug their own graves then were
machine gunned into them by Zionists in '67, Abu Grahb Americans, it's
all the same.....genocide....the Killing Fields.

http://www.liveleak.com/?ogr=1
Here, take a little time at LiveLeak and watch with your kids something
besides the Zionist Illuminati propaganda on the cable.......
Don't watch during dinner....gruesome.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; head to speak and have not invited him back is totally at odds with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any notion of free speech.  Why not invite David Duke?  This is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing but liberal hypocrisy ( a virtue among them) at its most
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious.  They do not allow ROTC but they INVITE someone who executes
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gays and stones women to death, only a liberal would think that is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure if the military ends its official discrimination on the basis
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of sexuality, it will be welcome where it isn't welcome now.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, The Iranian nutjob who kills gays is welcome but ROTC isnt?  This
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liberal logic I s'pose, not obvious to us rednecks.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'll take that as an admission of their hypocrisy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Huh?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Gilchrist lost control of his pack of racist vigilantes. Is he back in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; charge there? Is David Duke still a spokesman for his branch of the GOP?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Harry cannot find any way to defend the hypocrisy.  In fact, following
&gt; &gt; &gt; the logic of Columbia, if the US military started executing gays (as
&gt; &gt; &gt; does Iran) ROTC would be invited to Columbia.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Columbia HAS NOT invited the Minutemen back, so much for freedom of
&gt; &gt; &gt; speech there.

&gt; &gt; I'm sorry, but I cannot find even an atom of logic in what you are
&gt; &gt; posting here regarding that group that insulted the name of a fine
&gt; &gt; organization of revolutionary war Bostonians. Have a nice day.

&gt; C'mon Harry, at least try to defend yourself.  Columbia invites a guy
&gt; who executes gays but somehow you think Columbia will like ROTC if
&gt; they allow gays.  This makes no sense.- Hide quoted text -

Wrong newsgroup. I'd offer the same comment to  left wing posters who
put something equivalent here, (and have, lately), so you guys on the
right are entitled to equal treatment. If I might be allowed to
suggest- we should try to avoid getting back to the bad old days when
this group was 60% politics, 20% personal feud, and 20% boats. The way
to do that is to exercise some self control- put your political
opinions in the proper forums and talk about boats here.

The President of Iran is not a nice guy, and it's likely that a
majority of folks from all portions of the spectrun would agree. But
the rant should go where it's appropriate unless it has something to
do with boating. IMO.

Historically, most of the personal insults in rec.boats have cropped
up in the course of what passes for &quot;political debate&quot; on this forum.
After 2-3 exchanges, one side or the other runs of out Rush Limbaugh
or moveon.org talking points to repeat and in the ensuing frustration
the insults begin.

Then there are those who get their kicks out of insulting everybody in
sight regardless of the issue. There's no real hope for people in that
position, but by sticking closer to topic those folks normally able to
control themselves in a public setting won't be as inclined to call
names and hurl insults in pursuit of a personal political agenda.
Again, just my opinion.

Scotty has posted here for years, and his political sentiments are
well known. He and I would disagree on nearly every possible issue,
but the place to do that isn't here in rec.boats. I don't think he's a
bad guy for holding opinions that I believe are wrong, and I hope he
doesn't think I'm a bad guy for holding opinions that I'm sure he
believes are equally wrong. Twenty years after we're both dead history
will reveal that he was right about some things and I was right about
others. In the meantime, the reason we both gravitate to a boating
newsgroup is to discuss a *common* interest- and that's a good thing.

You're correct, Vic. I wouldn't know if you are left or right of
center nor do I care. Nor should anybody care about a person's
politics when discussing boating. When I talk to somebody at a yacht
club meeting or just across the dock at a marina or state park, we
would never think of beginning the conversation with, &quot;Before I answer
your question about where I got those spiffy leather fender hangers I
need to know how you feel about George Bush, the war in Iraq, illegal
immigrants, global warming, Hillary Clinton, etc..........&quot;  So why
here?  Point; there's no need or reason at all.

Most decent spinning reels have handles that can be reversed. I haven't
seen too many traditional casting reels on which you can switch the
crank handle.

I'm left handed for handwriting and holding a fork. I throw a baseball

right hand and reel with my left.

&gt;&gt; Maybe.  I'm left-handed, and get no flack about it.  Sure, some people
&gt;&gt; are jealous, but it's not their fault they were born wrong-handed.

&gt;Explain to me why most left-handed people hold a fishing rod with the reel
&gt;up rather than down like it's supposed to be.

&gt;Most reels have crank handles that may be swapped to the other side.
">

I don't change the handle on spinning reels, because I've adjusted to
changing hands after casting.  Probably was by the time I was 5 years
old.  Besides, I usually fish with righty family member and we swap
rods a lot.  I don't want to inconvenience them, since it's no problem
for me.  No problem cranking with my left hand, but since my right arm
is weaker it might affect hauling in a really big fish.  That's only
happened to me once.  Sob.
I've never seen anybody holding a rod with spinning reel on top, and
that is probably a figment of your imagination.  Perhaps some type of
compensation deal that a right-hander uses to cope.
I do put the crank on the right side of my casting reels, and NOBODY
uses my pets but me.
Did you know that scissors don't work well for left-handers?
That's no accident of design.  We don't like being a seamstress.

I never bother changing the spinners.  I should note that my casters
are baitcasters, lightweight and made to sit on top.  I've had 2 Abu
Garcias, a 5000C and 6000C and changed the handles, but I think there
are Penn models that have the option.
I never owned a big sea caster, just used them on charters.
But if I buy one I would want a right side crank.  Didn't know
convertibles were rare.

You're weird.
I do everything left, except mousing.  Most of this could be changed
if necessary.  It's in large part practice and habit.
I think plenty of leftys have been changed to rightys by nuns slapping
a ruler on their hand.

I suspect it was a novice fisherperson.
It's just impractical and clumsy, whether you're left of right handed.

Yeah, but we all started with right handed reels, which were much more
popular 40+ years ago when we all started fishing.

It is great. The Hudson River is one of the most scenic cruises in the

about every mile has something interesting to offer.
