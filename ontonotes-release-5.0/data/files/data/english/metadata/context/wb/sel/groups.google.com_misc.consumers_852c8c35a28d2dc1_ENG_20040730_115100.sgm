With all the campaign talk about health care, this would be an
interesting topic to discuss.

Probably one of the biggest reasons for people not having health
insurance is that they are self-employed or do not work for a company
that offers group insurance. In effect, there is a two-tier system,
employess in groups that are considered &quot;desireable&quot;, and those that
are not part of a group and considered &quot;undesireable&quot;.

Is this a good way to go about things, or would it be better to keep
health insurance out of the office?

One of the biggest reasons that people stay in less desireable jobs or
not start their own businesses is over the insurance issue.

lot more than group coverage, so if everybody stopped getting health
insurance from employers and instead purchased individual policies costs
would go way up.

"/> Actually, I doubt it makes a bit of difference to the underwriter
whether they insure groups or individuals. The Law of Large Numbers
works the same, whether you insure 100 groups of 5000 people or
500,000 individuals. In either case the insurer can expect to pay out
$somuch per person per year, based on past experience, so they need to
charge $somuch + something for their overhead and profit.

The one area where insuring a group is &quot;better&quot; is in the cost of
_selling_ the insurance. If you insure 500,000 individuals, you have
to sell the idea of health insurance _and_ that they should choose
_your_ insurance instead of one of your competitors, 500,000 times.
If you insure 100 groups, you only have to sell it 500 times.

The one thing that _does_ matter in a group is that everybody in the
group is covered (and pays premiums or has premiums paid on their
behalf). Otherwise you get the effect called &quot;adverse selection&quot;.
What that means is that people will wait, buying no health insurance
or only minimal insurance, until they get sick. Then they will buy
insurance at the group rate, and you end up insuring just those people
who are going to cost you the most. If insurance is mandatory for the
group (as with people working for a large employer)(*), then the
insurer can charge a &quot;reasonable&quot; premium for the whole group, which
includes both the young (mostly healthy) and the older workers (who
are more likely to have chronic problems that raise the cost of
insuring them.

(*) Most employers will let you opt out if somebody else in your
family has employer-paid health insurance that covers you, but not if
you are buying individual insurance. Again, it's because otherwise
the youngest &amp; healthiest would buy individual insurance and take
advantage of the lower premiums.

Note that this problem doesn't occur with individual health insurance.
When you apply for insurance, they require a medical exam and
permission to go through your medical records. So they know if you're
healthy, and if not, what problems you have that are likely to cost
more than the population average. Then they adjust your premium
accordingly.

&gt;What's the proposed alternative? Have everybody buy individual
&gt;policies? Have group policies based on some grouping other than
&gt;employer (and, if so, what?) Single-payer like Canada?

"/> One reason why &quot;employer-paid&quot; health insurance is so popular is
because it's tax deductible. My employer gets to count what they pay
as a business expense -- which lowers their taxes. But the (indirect)
payment to me of them covering my health insurance isn't taxable
income for me -- or for anybody (except the insurance company, to the
extent it makes a profit it can't hide from the taxman). What a great
deal.

Note that this type of insurance is mostly provided to people like me
who make above-average salaries. If you work at a minimum-wage job,
you don't get health insurance. Makes sense, the tax benefit isn't as
big at $15,000/year as it is when you make over $80K.

Which means of course that all the people working for Wal-Mart and
McDs and such like jobs are in effect _subsidizing me_ and people like
me -- I get a benefit that they don't, and I don't pay taxes on it.
But if they want to buy health insurance, they pay for it with dollars
that they have already paid taxes on!

This doesn't strike me as equitable somehow...

One &quot;solution&quot; is to make health insurance a taxable benefit, just as
life insurance (over $50K) is. Then there would be less demand for
this &quot;benefit&quot; from those of us in the upper-income scale. And with
fewer people going to doctors and not much caring how much it costs
because somebody else is paying the bill, there would be more
incentive for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies to keep costs and
prices down. Right now, the two most important things about a doctor
(or hospital) to me are

1) Do they have a track record (with me or other people I know)
that convinces me they will probably take good care of me --
cure whatever ails me, or alleviate it as much as possible if
it can't be cured.
2) How much _time_ do they cost me. A doctor close to work is
favored over one further away, and one who is usually on time
is &quot;better&quot; than one who is habitually late. Why? Because if
I spend more than 40 hours away during the workday in a year, I
will lose vacation days or possibly even wages.

Meanwhile, those who make less money don't go to the doctor until they
get sick enough they can't function, because they can't afford the
co-payments (if they have insurance) or the fees (if they don't).

Again this doesn't seem right.

"/> The problem has nothing to do with group insurance per se. The problem
is that employers do not buy insurance with a &quot;guaranteed for life
renewable/convertible&quot; even though that just saves them 5% on premiums.
The &quot;guaranteed renewable/convertible&quot; feature means you can continue to
buy insurance at the original groups rates even if you are no longer
employed and your health fails and you become otherwise uninsurable. All
individual policies have this feature since it does not make sense for
the insured not to demand this feature for just 5% extra, but the
employer doesn't care what happens to the insured after he/she is no
longer employed, so choses to save 5% by excluding &quot;guaranteed
renewability/convertibility&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;What's the proposed alternative? Have everybody buy individual
&gt;policies? Have group policies based on some grouping other than
&gt;employer (and, if so, what?) Single-payer like Canada?

"/> There is a simple solution : US Congress should pass a law requiring all
employers to offer &quot;guaranteed renewable/convertible&quot; health insurance.
It would be OK if employers were allowed to pass on the extra 5% cost to
the employee and make it optional (only an idiot employee would chose
not to pay the extra 5%).

Some Congressmen have tried to do this in the past by extending the
right to continue coverage after employment ends from 1.5 years to life
(as now the employee would pay the premium after employment ends, but it
could be no more than 102% of what it costs fior existing employees)
This would effectively force employers to buy &quot;guaranteed
renewable/convertible&quot; health insurance (or take on the risk of
ex-employees with poor health themselves). Instead a watered down
version fo the bill was passed : At the request of insurance industry
it now merely entitles formerly covered employees after their COBRA
coverage of 1.5 years expires, to buy any individual health policy
without having to pay a &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; premium surcharge,
provided the new policy is bought within 60 days of the old policy
lapsing. The new insurance company can recover the cost of pre-existing
conditions from the previous employer's insurance company, I believe.

Note for those savvy enough to buy their own individual policy after
losing covered employment for more than 1.5 years you effectively have
&quot;guaranteed renewable/convertible&quot; health insurance. The limitation of
the current law is primarilty that it forces former employees after 1.5
years to buy individual policies that are more expensive and more
lucrative for the insurance industry.

"/> That's an interesting question. You'll get a wide range of responses.
For me, I am relatively happy with both my job and my health insurance
benefits that I get from my employer. As such, I see no reason to fix
something that's not broken.

On the other hand, high medical insurance costs are probably a potent
factor that motivates American companies to off-shore their work force.
If companies didn't have to shoulder the cost of their employees' medical
care, it would make the American work force much more cost-competitive
with workers in many foreign companies. For example, I am not sure, but
I doubt all those workers in India who are doing jobs Americans used to
do get employer funded health care; they probably have government funded
health care.

None of this really matters; the big deal is that most types of
insurance (life, auto, home) protect against a single catastrophic event
like a death, crash, or fire. Health insurance is intended to protect
against the development of a chronic health condition (say, cancer) which
will be an issue the rest of your life.

Also, most people are willing to live with the fact that some people
have to live without a car. Most people are not willing to live with
the fact that some people get sick and die in the gutter; there are a
few in this newsgroup who would be OK with that, but as a society we are
not (although those folks can have their pick of third-world countries
if they really want that.)

"/> Medical costs are often fairly predictable based on past medical history.
That kind of defeats the purpose of insurance (imagine if someone were to
buy minimal or no medical insurance, then got a diagnosis of some expensive
medical problem, then bought higher coverage medical insurance before getting
the expensive treatment).

Employer groups are used because most people choose employment on the
basis of things other than medical insurance (at least when considering
employers that offer medical insurance to employees), so the risk
spreading function of insurance works somewhat better than with
individually bought medical insurance.

Obviously, there are plenty of problems with employer group medical
insurance (versus other schemes of buying medical insurance):

1. Changing jobs means changing medical insurance.

2. Users and buyers may have different priorities when choosing the level
or type of insurance versus the premiums it costs.

3. Self employed, retired, student, unemployed, etc. people do not fit
into the employer group scheme. Also, small businesses may find it
more difficult or expensive to buy medical insurance for their employees
than large businesses.

4. Medical insurance adds an overhead to the cost of employing someone,
although the employee may not gain the full value of the cost of the
insurance (because s/he would have preferred different medical insurance).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With all the campaign talk about health care, this would be an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;interesting topic to discuss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably one of the biggest reasons for people not having health
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;insurance is that they are self-employed or do not work for a company
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that offers group insurance. In effect, there is a two-tier system,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;employess in groups that are considered &quot;desireable&quot;, and those that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are not part of a group and considered &quot;undesireable&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A different way to put it is that underwriters prefer to insure
groups,
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than individuals, because it's less risky for them. For the
&gt;&gt;&gt; group to be meaningful for the purpose of underwriting, it needs to be
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; group that's nontrivial to join or leave, and preferably a group which
&gt;&gt;&gt; most people don't belong to more than one instance of. Employment
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly fits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is this a good way to go about things, or would it be better to keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;health insurance out of the office?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the proposed alternative? Have everybody buy individual
&gt;&gt;&gt; policies?

&gt;&gt; What's wrong with that in principle? I don't buy my car insurance from
my
&gt;&gt; employer - what's so different about health insurance?

&gt; Auto insurance is not essential to life,
&gt; health insurance is.

So how come nobody is screaming about the poor people who don't

they run out of toilet paper, they actually have to pay for it with
money. Is this fair? Aren't we risking thousands of people pooping

"/>  In a recent prior thread I have argued against an opponent whose figures
were USA 6.6% Canada 6.7 % of GDP spent by government on healthcare, with
my opponent so glad to say the USA 6.6% figure did not include employer
contributions to health insurance premiums of most public sector employees
in order to score a point against me by pointing out how I was wrong about
something.

According to this opponent's figures and web cites, Canada has 6.7% of
GDP spent by gov't on healthcare and about 9% of GDP spent on healthcare.
I say this belies claims of bans of private spending on healthcare!

I surely say that Hillary Clinton cannot achieve a ban on private
healthcare expenditures in the USA more than Canada has! Surely the USA
is the nation of freedom-loving outlaws!

(Total % of USA GDP spent on healthcare as acknowledged by the one I
recently argued with is 14% - he argues how bad is this in a country with
as he claims a higher standard of living. He also argues that many of the
14% of the USA's uncovered are voluntarily so or deservedly so by being
illegal aliens or by not getting their paperwork right. I claim that this
does not change the fact that according to his figures the USA has
government spending 6.6% of GDP vs. Canada's 6.7% while 14% of the USA
population is uncovered and 190 million out of 290 million in the USA
population are covered out of their and/or their employers' pockets and
not benefiting from the 6.6% of GDP spent by USA gov't on healthcare while
Canada gives universal basic coverage with 6.7% of their GDP!)

&gt; What's the proposed alternative? Have everybody buy individual
&gt; policies? Have group policies based on some grouping other than
&gt; employer (and, if so, what?) Single-payer like Canada?

"/> New Zealand has a &quot;socialised&quot; (heavily-tax-funded)
medical system.

General practitioners for relatively minor stuff (e.g.
and ear infection), dentists, and optometrists have to
be paid by the patient. (Sorry to interfere with
anyone's &quot;free&quot; fantasies.)

Prescriptions are heavily subsidised, with a standard
co-payment.

Problems/conditions requiring a specialist, and/or
hospital treatment are covered by general taxe$.
(Whoops, sorry to interfere with those &quot;free&quot; fantasies
again.)

Problems/conditions related to accidents/injuries (both
on- and off-job) are covered by separate fund (Accident
Comensation Corp.) That fund requires a payment for
premiums over-and-above normal taxe$. &quot;Requires&quot; means
that you can NOT opt-out. If you are in business, you
pay the premiums for the accident insurance.

The amount of the ACC premium is based upon the
business category (e.g. white-collar workers are less
safer and thus cheaper), and also as a percentage of
total (before tax) income.

If you are self-employed, you get a yearly bill from
ACC.

Despite the hopes of some Americans, there is really no
such thing as a &quot;free&quot; medical care system, anywhere in
the world. The current NZ government has even
suggested adding a &quot;fat tax&quot; onto certain foods, to
compensate for the expenses of obesity-related health
care (so that, even if you are generally healthy, your
occasional fast food meal will require you to help pay
for those people who shovel down loads of junk every
day.)

And don't get me started on the fact that the mentality
which encourages &quot;socialised&quot; medical systems also
encourages welfare systems, in which appalling
numbers able-bodied/minded people get ALL of their
basic necessities out of the taxpayors pockets.

Gee, that way, I can pay for their cigarettes, booze,
junk food, and drugs, in addition to paying for the
medical care they will need because of those things...
I better make sure that I take good care of MY health,
so I can keep working and being so generous :-)

"/> No; food and shelter expenses are generally predictable and therefore
insurance programs are not appropriate there. It is the case that
there exist poor people who have difficulty affording food and shelter,
and that there exist government programs which attempt to address this
issue, with varying levels of success. You probably knew this already.

The main difference is that, in the case of food, most people are able
to get adequate access to food through either their own resources,
existing government programs, private charity, etc. Likewise, mostly,
with shelter. Health care is an area where there's a more substantial
gap of people who are gainfully employed and have too much money to
qualify for government programs like Medicaid but not enough money to
reasonably pay for their own health care needs.

(and yes, some of them are in this situation partially due to their
own poor money management choices or the like.)

"/> Believe it or not, the extra 2.7% (or perhaps more) is people crossing
the border into the US to buy healthcare in our (partly private)
market.

But the last figure I saw for the US was closer to 14% of GDP spent on
healthcare. But you have to be careful when you compare spending.
Frinstance, I suspect that the 9% GDP for Canada counts direct
spending (hospital and medical bills) but not indirect spending
(travel costs and cost of lodgings in the US while being treated).

Also to be considered is the quality of what you are getting. This
varies _extremely_ widely in the US. If you are able to get (and
afford) an &quot;indemnity&quot; plan(*), you can get very good care *if* you
are careful about choosing your physician. If you choose an
overworked or careless or otherwise not-very-good doctor, you can get
mediocre care (or worse) while paying premium prices. But with an
&quot;indemnity&quot; or PPO plan, you can almost always be treated within a day
or two for most conditions. Or at least get the process started with
appropriate tests, etc. This applies to people on traditional
Medicare, with or without a supplemental plan (A through H depending
on what you want covered).

(*) One where you choose your doctor and the insurance pays the bills,
up to some maximum that they determine by a survey of charges for a
given condition/procedure in your area.

If you have to rely on an HMO (including Medicare patients who have
chosen a medicare HMO plan to save money), you can wait almost as long
here as you would in Canada. In fact, with an HMO you may be denied
treatment for a life threatening condition, because the &quot;gatekeeper&quot;
doesn't want to spend the money for the test to see what's wrong with
you. If you have an employer-paid HMO plan, you won't even be able to
sue for the loss of your life or limb or whatever -- just for what
they would have paid if they had covered the treatment. Needless to
say, this doesn't give HMOs much incentive to treat people right when
they get an expensive illness. (HMOs _do_ have an incentive to treat
people with common illlenesses well, because the word gets around and
their customers can &quot;vote with their feet&quot;. Most employers offer a
choice of plans and people can switch pretty freely once a year.)

But as somebody else noted, employer-paid plans are health-care plans,
not health &quot;insurance&quot;. They pay for routine care including annual
physicals. And if you have something catastrophic go wrong, you may
have trouble getting approval for treatment, esp. in an HMO. WHich is
the exact opposite of true insurance. Insurance is supposed to
protect you from _catastrophic_ events -- like that brain tumor that
requires $50K of surgery and may need another $100K of followup, or a
multi-$100K heart transplant.

But with true insurance you would pay your &quot;normal&quot; expenses out of
your own pocket. That includes not only routine stuff like physical
exams, but also the average $1000 or $2000 that almost everybody
spends on medical treatment every year. And in fact it should have
a deductible somewhat bigger than your typical year's expenses. If
your average expenses are $1000, then you should probably carry a
deductible of $2000 or so. You should just have enough liquid assets
to cover an _occasional_ event that approximately doubles _one_
element of your normal yearly expenses. If you can't, you are
living beyond your means. In fact, anybody who has been working more
than about 5-7 years should have an extra full year of living expenses
in the bank or some other place where you can easily get at it.

Always remember: TANSTAAFL. There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch. And there ain't no such thing as free medical care. If we
choose to pay for medical care for everybody, we're going to have to
give up something else that we like. Maybe spend less on the
military, or on support for the aged (Social Security), or maybe pay
higher taxes.

Oh, and btw in case you haven't been paying attention to election
results, higher taxes aren't real popular with the people who vote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;employess in groups that are considered &quot;desireable&quot;, and those that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are not part of a group and considered &quot;undesireable&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A different way to put it is that underwriters prefer to insure
&gt; groups,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than individuals, because it's less risky for them. For the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group to be meaningful for the purpose of underwriting, it needs to be
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group that's nontrivial to join or leave, and preferably a group which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most people don't belong to more than one instance of. Employment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly fits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is this a good way to go about things, or would it be better to keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;health insurance out of the office?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the proposed alternative? Have everybody buy individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; policies?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's wrong with that in principle? I don't buy my car insurance from
&gt; my

&gt;&gt; Auto insurance is not essential to life,
&gt;&gt; health insurance is.

We could go on like this forever but there's not much point. The fact
remains that just because something is essential to life doesn't mean that
the entity we obtain it from has to be the same entity that we choose to
make a living selling our labor to. They are (or should be) completely
unrelated decisions.

And as others have pointed out, health insurance is not essential to life.
It may be essential to maintaining a bankruptcy-free credit history but
that's not the same thing. You still got the life-saving medical care. It's
the care-provider that gets shafted because you didn't have the money to pay
for it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, it is possible to pay for health care services
&gt;&gt; without health insurance. Man has been doing so for thousands of
&gt;&gt; years, up to the last century or two. In spite of Hillary Clinton's
&gt;&gt; best efforts, it is not (yet) illegal to actually pay a doctor cash
&gt;&gt; that isn't part of a &quot;copay&quot; for services.

&gt;&gt; Health care services are arguably essential to life. Insurance,
&gt;&gt; of any type, is not.

&gt;Really? So what does a person of modest means without good health
&gt;insurance do when the bill for his heart bypass surgery arrives in
&gt;the mail and he's stuck with a payment that's larger than his mortgage?

"/> Last I heard, bankruptcy is not fatal. Neither is homelessness.
(Remember, you said he GOT his heart bypass surgery. He didn't die
in the street.) And I think you're assuming that insurance is the
only possible way to pay such a bill. Some people actually save
money. And the big health care bills tend to come later in life
after one has had a chance to accumulate some savings. And if the
employer's contribution to the cost of medical insurance were instead
paid into an account for medical expenses, the savings would grow
a lot faster.

Remember, insurance is a for-profit industry. It pays out less
than it takes in in premiums. And it takes a lot of bureaucracy
and paperwork to deny so many claims, and the cost of doing that
also comes out of the premiums it receives.

Insurance may not pay the bill, either. Either the copay alone
bankrupts this person, or it simply hits the limits of coverage and
refuses to pay.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So how come nobody is screaming about the poor people who don't
&gt;&gt; have toilet paper insurance? Almost nobody has that coverage. If
&gt;&gt; they run out of toilet paper, they actually have to pay for it with
&gt;&gt; money. Is this fair? Aren't we risking thousands of people pooping
&gt;&gt; in the streets?

&gt;Most people can afford toilet paper, even those who are at the
&gt;low end of poverty. Are you really serious, or are you a troll?

"/> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT CAN'T??? THEY'LL BE POOPING IN THE
STREETS!! (or, at least this is the kind of problem politicians
try to use to get elected.)

I'm quite serious that it is not necessary to have insurance for
each and every possible expense that a person can have. Even if
it's &quot;unexpected&quot;. (For example, it should NOT be &quot;unexpected&quot;
that your car or house needs repairs or maintenance occasionally,
although you may not know just when it will happen, it will. The
same applies to medical costs.) Some politicians are genuinely
horrified at copays or just use it as an excuse to make government
bigger.

*Catastrophic* medical insurance (which kicks in, say, after a
deductible of $10,000 a year, and has a huge limit, perhaps much
bigger than most employer-paid insurance does now) would cover most
of that heart bypass, but it also wouldn't have such an inflated
cost because it doesn't try to cover 80% of Junior's visit to the
doctor with the flu or Mommy's birth control pills or Daddy's annual
physical. Of course, it's not as politically popular because most
people wouldn't get any benefits out of it in any given decade.
And some people choose not to have such coverage because they prefer
to spend it on a fancier car or a vacation.

The &quot;medical savings account&quot; does have its uses, even if you can't
accumulate it. Mostly: tax savings. If you're afraid of forfeiting
some, guess low. However, allowing accumulation would make it much
more useful.

premium for the catastrophic insurance coverage + yearly out of
pocket maximum for the catastrophic insurance coverage is less
than the premium alone for an insurance plan that covers more of
the smaller expenses with $10 copayments or whatever.

Probably has to do with less bureaucracy involved, but it seems
that such insurance arrangements are not very popular.

&gt; On the other hand, high medical insurance costs are probably a potent
&gt; factor that motivates American companies to off-shore their work force.
&gt; If companies didn't have to shoulder the cost of their employees' medical
&gt; care, it would make the American work force much more cost-competitive
&gt; with workers in many foreign companies. For example, I am not sure, but

"/> Employer paid healthcare originated as a means of increasing employee
paychecks when there were government mandated wage freezes in place during
World War 2. As you've noted, there are all sorts of nasty side effects to
this. The major one is that benefits are not portable and the consumer has
no say in the cost/benefit equation. This leads to overuse and rising
healthcare costs.

Those that argue against changing this, are usually in two camps: Ones that
want &quot;government paid&quot; health care for everyone and ones that are afraid
that individual insurance buyers will lead to self selection, where the
healthier groups will get preferred rates.

"/> Because with a single pool, you lose the benefits of competition and innovation.
You also get stuck with lowest common demoninator care.

Once pools get above a certain size, there is no great benefit to getting
larger. That size can be determined statistically, but certainly a few hundred
thousand would more than cover things.

&gt; All other things being equal, a bigger pool is better, but in this case
&gt; not all other things are equal. Mind you, the most expensive folks
&gt; (elderly, disabled, people with expensive chronic conditions) tend to
&gt; end up being covered by the govt anyway through Medicare and Medicaid
&gt; and the like.

&gt;&gt;You're missing a BIG difference in a VOLUNTARY large pool such as a
&gt;&gt;corporation buying insurance from where they choose, and everybody

&gt;&quot;Voluntary pool&quot; is an oxymoron. The reason a pool gets cheaper rates
&gt; is because people can't self-select into it, and hence it's a better
&gt; random sample of the population and so easier to make actuarial
&gt; assumptions about.

"/> Sure it's voluntary. You don't have to buy into your company's health
care plan. And if you're married, you might have two company options
which to choose from. It's certainly more voluntary than being
forced by the end of a gun to pay.

"/> My wife's company provides no insurance, however mine offers at least
three plans (some years more) and several options (eye, dental, long-term
disability, etc.) from different groups at different rates. Each employee
can choose the plan that's best for heir situation. Even with one employer
offering medical insurance, we certainly can choose which pool (or none)
we wish to belong to.

"/> It's not really that voluntary in many cases. You don't get a full
rebate of the premiums that the company pays for your insurance plan
if you opt out, and many companies only let you opt out if you show
that you have some other coverage through your spouse or whatever.

And your market power when covered by medical insurance through
employment is restricted in most cases, since your choices are
limited to the few that your employer offers. Generally, only
employees of the national or large state governments in the US get
a large number of choices of insurance plans to pick from.
