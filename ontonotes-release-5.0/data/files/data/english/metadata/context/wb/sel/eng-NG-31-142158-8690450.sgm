Bangladesh Takes It Out On 20 Year Old Cartoonist To Save Allah's
Honor!!   .....   .....

Limits of satire
By Mahmud Rahman
September 19, 2007

On Tuesday, September 18, Arifur Rahman, a 20-year old, was picked up
from his Uttara residence, interrogated by police intelligence, and
then sent to jail. His offense? He was the author of a cartoon that
appeared in Alpin, the weekly satire supplement to Prothom Alo, the
largest circulation Bangla newspaper in Bangladesh. The sub-editor
responsible for Alpin was fired from his job.

The government banned the edition of Alpin and the Law Advisor
told a gathering that included members of the Islamic Oikyo Jote, an
Islamist political party, that there was a conspiracy to destabilize
the government.

The implication was clear: Arifur Rahman was part of such a
conspiracy.

The actions against Alpin and Arifur Rahman have been justified on
the grounds that the cartoon offended the religious sentiments of
Muslims.

Why are we a people so prone to exaggerate? So ready to create
storms in a teacup? Anyone who lives here knows how small our teacups
are.

When Prothom Alo, in its Tuesday morning edition, asked forgiveness
for the cartoon, condemning it as unacceptable, I wondered what
cartoon they were referring to. On Monday morning I'd read Alpin and
tossed it into my pile of old newspapers. No cartoon in that issue had
struck me as outrageous.

So I went back to pick up my issue of Alpin. Perhaps I violated
the ban order against the magazine by doing so. Perhaps my duty, under
the law, was to hoist the magazine with rubber gloves, put it in a
polythene bag, and deliver it to the nearest police station.

When I re-read the cartoon, I remembered laughing at it. But I
don't remember thinking it so humorous that I forwarded it to friends,
what you usually do with jokes that you really really find funny.

I can't reproduce the cartoon -- after all, it is banned. But
here's the exchange it depicts. A tall man in a cap asks a young boy
holding a cat, &quot;What is your name?&quot; The kid says, &quot;Babu.&quot; The man
says, &quot;You're supposed to say Mohammed before a name.&quot; And he asks the
boy again, &quot;What is your father's name?&quot; The boy says, &quot;Mohammed
Abbu.&quot; Then pointing at the cat, the man asks, &quot;What's that in your
hands?&quot; You can guess the rest.

The same day Prothom Alo retracted its cartoon, it carried a
column by Syed Abul Maksud. In one section, he remembers the time in
the 1980s when camels first appeared in Dhaka. They were kept in a
field in Kalabagan. It seems hundreds of believers showed up there to
collect the urine of the camels and take it home with them. They
apparently believed that the camels came from Arabia and since Arabia
was the land of Mohammed, the camel urine must carry Allah's
blessings. Then the news came out that the camels came not from Arabia
but from Pakistan. That didn't deter the faithful. After all, Pakistan
is to the west too, not far from Arabia. Finally it was revealed the
camels really came from Rajasthan in India. Evidently Shamsur Rahman
and others wrote in the press that time that we have retreated into
the Middle Ages.

As this cartoon controversy shows, we are still there.

The newspapers print the names of leaders of Islamic political
parties claiming the cartoon insults religious sensibility. They
apparently find it blasphemous.

But even if you're a believer, examine the cartoon. It's not about
Islam or Mohammed. Instead the cartoon depicts a certain sort of
believer and shows a child's bemusement at that sort of believer.
Muslims around the world have many, many names, yet there is a certain
kind of believer here that a true Muslim name must have Mohammed
before it. The cartoonist didn't invent this kind of believer - they
exist in our society.

It's a strange business, this charge that the cartoon insults the
religious sensibilities of Muslims. Two things occur to me.

One. Is the belief of the faithful so weak that this cartoon
poking fun at a kind of murkho believer can shake it? If so, the
faithful should be advised to not read satirical magazines. Or
newspapers. They are bound to find many things there that might
disturb their faith.

And if Prothom Alo really believes what it admitted, then it
should realize that it regularly prints many things that offend the
sensibilities of some believer or other. The columnist who mentioned
the camel story - he should go. Perhaps he already has. Many
columnists that used to write regular columns no longer seem to have a
place in the newspaper. And what about all those photos of women
showing skin? Maria Sharapova should go. I'd never seen the lady until
I came to Dhaka. I'm sure for every person who buys the newspaper for
those photos, there's someone else who's offended. Perhaps even the
same person.

Two. Many heinous acts are committed by people using the name of
religion. We became independent in a war that Pakistan conducted in
the name of defending Islam. And how many politicians are sitting in
jail today accused of looting and corruption who repeatedly went to
perform Hajj and Umrao at Mecca? In fact the very leaders of the
Islamic Oikyo Jote who met with the Law Advisor to demand harsh
punishment for the cartoon were part of the same government that set
world records in corruption. That government mouthed religious words
more than any other government in our history.

One would think that the deeds of such people who commit crimes
while mouthing religious words does more harm to religious
sensibilities. But we don't see the Islamists ever claiming that.

This isn't the only example here of an odd sort of faith. Take the
greeting Allah Hafez that seems to have become so beloved by some
people here. I remember hearing it first on a Bangladesh Biman flight
in 1995. I wondered then where it came from.

It turns out it is not even a result of Bangladeshi Muslim
creativity. It was imported from Pakistan.

Many Muslims have for long been saying goodbye with &quot;Khoda Hafez.&quot;
The greeting is Persian in origin and has a long history in the
subcontinent. Some geniuses in Pakistan one day realized that Khoda is
Persian. Believing that Arabic is God's closest language -- ignoring
what this means about a universal being reigning over a planet rich
with hundreds of languages -- they changed Khoda to Allah. But they
kept Hafiz, the other half of the greeting, in Persian. Now we have a
half Arabic, half Persian greeting. These geniuses in Pakistan also
did not seem to realize that Allah is not a word unique to Muslims. I
understand that Allah is simply Arabic for God. Arabs who believe in
some sort of God call that deity Allah, whether they are Christian or
Muslim or something else.

And what of our 'moderate Muslim' liberals? Faced with the first blast
from the self-appointed guardians of faith,  they caved in. Shame on
Prothom Alo. Either they are too worried about drops in their
circulation or they really believe in their actions. In either case,
they have stepped away from the fight against ignorance or the need to
defend freedom of the press. They have put their feet on a slippery
slope. Now watch what new demands come their way.

The honorable thing for the newspaper to do, if they really wanted
to recognize the opinion of the critics, would have been to publish
their statement explaining why they found the cartoon offensive. The
critics should have had to explain, not simply assert. And they needed
to give it as their opinion and not something in the name of
multitudes or an entire religion.

The honorable thing for the government would have been to ignore
the affair as unworthy of official attention, urge the hotheads to
calm down, and leave the matter, if it deserved, as something that can
be debated in the press, without resort to bans and arrests.

The last word: Arifur Rahman deserves to be freed.

Prothom Alo cartoonist arrested  -  Govt orders confiscation of Alpin
issue

The interim government on Tuesday arrested a cartoonist and
confiscated the issue of the Alpin, a weekly magazine of the Prothom
Alo, for publishing a cartoon that has 'hurt the people's religious
sentiment.'

'The government has confiscated the issue as the cartoon hurts the
religious sentiment of the people,' said a PID handout.

Authorities of the Prothom Alo, however, apologised and announced
withdrawal of the cartoon titled Naam (name), mentioned the handout.

A delegation led by the Baitul Mukarram mosque's khatib, Obaidul
Haque, called on the law and information adviser, Mainul Hosein, and
demanded cancellation of the declaration of the Prothom Alo and arrest
of its editor, along with others concerned, before this Friday 'for
showing disrespect to Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (pbuh)'.

The cartoon ridiculed the prophet by adding his name (Mohammad)
before an animal, they said.

'It is a conspiracy to destabilise the country. We are very
concerned over the issue,' Mainul told reporters after the meeting.

The conspirators wanted to throw the country into a chaotic
situation, he claimed.

The adviser asked everyone to remain
