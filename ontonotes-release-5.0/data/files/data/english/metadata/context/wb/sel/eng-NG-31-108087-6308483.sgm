Don't be surprised if this individual is "rehabilitated" and released, and
eventually decides he'd like to try having sex with a dead human. He'd
probably start with children or the elderly, since they'd be easier victims
in most cases. Or maybe just a fresh corpse, if he were able to gain access
to one.

Kurt, this is a case where I think shooting is appropriate. Or hanging. Or
stoning. We like to think that everything's fixable, but some people are
just messed up and can't be fixed.

This is the guys SECOND conviction for it.  Gee, does that
indicate a trend ?

Then again, there's that guy who was being taken to court from
jail in handcuffs in Georgia for ( I forget ), he grabbed a deputy's
gun, killed the Judge, 2 cops, and the court reporter, and so far the
Public Defender's office has spent 1.4 MILLION dollars defending him ,
and the trial is on hold because they say they need more money for it.

I'd volunteer to pay for, and personally deliver, 25 cents
worth of lead .... and that's just for the PD who wants more money.

Whats the bit that deserves the death penalty?......the killing of the
animal (aren't deer pests that need to be destroyed for the sake of
keeping them off the road to save motorcyclists lives)?........or the

I was speculating. That's the use of the conditional future tense there,

Yep. His "fetish" is way more twisted than most. Don't forget the killing

Is a deer different than a horse? He switched species once, he could do it
again. This is where psych evaluation is key to find out (if possible)
whether his thing is specifically limited to furry quadrupeds that are dead,
and whether the killing is significant to him.

Benignly different is the guy who obsesses about Star Trek and wears vulcan

&gt;&gt; specialize in murderous, sexual animal fetishes.

&gt; Give him a job out in the backwoods, culling deer of course. He wants to
&gt; kill animals, give him the chance until he's sick of it. Why try to
&gt; 'control' an urge when it can be put to good use?
">

So cast him out from society where he can't hurt anyone? Not a bad idea. Can
we put a big cage around him? Or maybe chain him up? Or how about a shock
collar with an electric fence?

I don't like the idea of reward his sick behavior, though. If a different
guy got busted strangling kittens, would you give him a job at an animal
shelter and put him charge of euthanizing animals? That sounds like
grotesquely twisted "justice".

There are better ways to cull deer, besides. This guy would be horrible at
it, since he'd have to get it on with the corpses. That's maybe 1 deer a
day, 2 max.

Speculating just adds fuel to the fire....As if it's not bad enough

&gt; Yep. His &quot;fetish&quot; is way more twisted than most. Don't forget the killing

&gt; Well, maybe not in your way of thinking, but I think it SHOULD matter. Some

How about forced labor? Chain gang type of thing. Doing menial, difficult

&gt;We aren't allowed to carry firearms here, but if youv'e got a hunting

&gt;your shoulder on a bike). The hunting permits are free and last for 3

Dunno, I'll have to look up the official season on

She said "should I ever be in harm's way".

Presumably if she were to see the guy, or another like him, having sex with
an animal corpse alongside the road, she could just ride on (fast) and get
to the nearest town to report it.

If she were changing a flat and the scene from Deliverance started playing
out, then a gun would be a great thing to have.

Is that a real concern for Americans? I thought Deliverance was a movie,
not a documentary?

I had 2 guys break into my house when I was in high school, and was forced
to even the odds with a deer rifle. Does that count?

To this day, I will insist that nothing sobers up a couple of idiots faster
than the noise of a slide action weapon chambering a round while being
pointed at them. That "clack-clack" is pretty distinctive, only nowadays the
deterrent of choice is a short barreled 12 gauge with 3" mags and 00
buckshot.

Literally!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Fair enough. But look at other horror's that go in 'polite society' to

&gt; That's a bad way to think. If you follow that logic, then ANYTHING can be
&gt; deemed acceptable, when clearly not everything is. Some things are simply
&gt; wrong, and everyone who's not crazy knows it.

No, I'm not saying it's acceptable, just that there are worse things
happening. It is wrong, but not death penalty wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'd say it was a means to an end. It's not something you would ponder on
&gt;&gt; every day, but think of a horse or deer, now think how you would have
&gt;&gt; sex with them if they were alive......difficult, to say the least.

&gt; Granted. But you're making an assumption on his motivation. Since we're
&gt; pondering, why don't you try to put yourself inside the head of a guy for
&gt; whom the killing is a necessary part of the sexual act. That's a bit more
&gt; frightening than what you've been thinking, isn't it?

Thats what the psych report should show.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is a deer different than a horse?

&gt;&gt; Closer to each other than to a human.......

&gt; So next maybe he'll choose a goat, then a dog, then... ? The point is, if
&gt; he's killing and screwing animals, how can we even begin to guess where his
&gt; limits are? He's already so far outside of normal behavior that we really
&gt; have no idea what he will or won't do.

You can't put someone to death because you don't know what they are
going to do in the future.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I enjoy killing animals, but I'm no murderer of humans.

&gt;&gt; there should definately be some psych evaluation. It would be a bizzare
&gt;&gt; meeting to be a fly on the wall.

&gt;&gt; They guy is only 20....he got busted at 18.....I wonder if he's ever had
&gt;&gt; a woman?

&gt; I'd say not. Probably a lonely bastard who doesn't get along well with
&gt; others. He's sexually frustrated and socially inept.
">

And for that he should die?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Is it only people who kill forest creatures and have sex with them that
&gt;&gt; commit murders? No.

&gt;&gt; But the whole population 'could' become murderers. We all have that
&gt;&gt; potential, just different reasoning to justify it.

&gt; Are you saying that people who kill forest and farm creatures and have sex
&gt; with the fresh corpses are JUST AS LIKELY as normal people to commit murder
&gt; or rape? Sure anyone COULD commit murder, but this guy sounds like he's
&gt; working up to it.

Why not? People snap all the time......does 'going postal' ring any bells?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The killing is a means to an end.
&gt;&gt; I'm not implying he's just like everyone else, just that he doesn't
&gt;&gt; deserve your death sentence for his actions.

&gt; You assume the killing is a means to an end because thinking that it's part
&gt; of the thrill is so disturbing it couldn't possibly be true. You're putting
&gt; yourself in his situation and asking &quot;how would I have sex with a deer?&quot;,
&gt; when you should be wondering why HE killed and had sex with a dead deer and
&gt; horse. Remember that he isn't making decisions using your value system.
">

True.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Not at all. Why would I have to worry about an animal necrophiliac?
&gt;&gt; I'm not a horse or a deer.......

&gt; Again, you're making the assumption that his kill-then-fuck-the-corpse habit
&gt; only applies to animals. That's not an assumption I'd stake my family's
&gt; safety on.
">

Innocent until proven guilty? does that still apply over there or did
the Patriot Act do a number on that as well?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You see what you want to see. You figure that because he's already done
&gt;&gt; something that repulses you, that he will do other things that repulse you.

&gt;&gt; I see a deviant with a particular bend.

&gt; You're exactly right, we do see what we want. And yes, I figure that because
&gt; he's demonstrated a pattern of killing animals and having sex with them that
&gt; he will continue to do so. And because he's varied the animal already, he'll
&gt; likely continue to do that as well. Frankly I think my assumptions are more
&gt; logical than yours.

It would be interesting if we were both on his jury..........

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I still don't see your 'dangerous' part. It's only in yoour 'what if'
&gt;&gt; scenario. What if you were to kill someone....does my 'what if'
&gt;&gt; automatically make you dangerous?

&gt; Depends on why I did it. Did I kill someone in self defense? Then I guess
&gt; I'm dangerous to attack. Did I kill someone because they pissed me off? Then
&gt; I could be dangerous to make upset. Did I kill someone for some sort of
&gt; twisted sexual thrill? Then I'm dangerous as long as I want to have that
&gt; thrill again.
">

See, you are just as dangerous as the dead deer fucker. You just have a
different excuse for your actions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't respect a society where it is acceptable to torture inmates,
&gt;&gt; yet it happens. Are those guards who torment and torture prisoners
&gt;&gt; 'dangerous', or just ordinary guys doing a job?

&gt;&gt; I don't think what he's done is a good thing, but again, it doesn't
&gt;&gt; deserve the death penalty.

&gt; How about forced labor? Chain gang type of thing. Doing menial, difficult
&gt; work that's hard to get done otherwise. That could be a good middle ground
&gt; between slap on the wrist and death penalty.
">

I'd agree with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for guards who abuse inmates, they are people who see cruelty and
&gt; violence every day of their working lives. It's bound to have an effect. Not
&gt; excusable, but explainable. I don't like the idea of jails full of
&gt; criminals. If we killed the really bad ones, the ones who are dedicated
&gt; violent victimizers, put the mid level ones to work for some years, our
&gt; jails wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Iv'e only seen jail movies,,,,if they are even close to real life, I
wouldn't want to go there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't expect you to trust him, just don't put him to death.

&gt; Should I wait until he rapes and murders a child?
">

Yes, that is a death sentence crime. And if he doesn't rape and murder a
child, he shouldn't be treated like a child rapist murderer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Andd the guy who thought he was having consentual sex, only to have the
&gt;&gt; woman cry rape the next day....he should die too?

&gt; Depends. Would any reasonable person think the same way he thought? Or was
&gt; he crazy in thinking it was consensual, like an obsessed stalker? There are
&gt; bound to be fringe cases that require careful looking into, but the REAL
&gt; rapists should be killed. Any woman who is found to be crying wolf maybe
&gt; should be sent to prison herself. We can always use another cheap laborer.
&gt; Plenty of work to go around.
">

I'd like to see that. A woman laying a false charge doing the time the
guy would have if he had gone away.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Of course they would. Those people are doing it for the money, not for
&gt;&gt; fun. it would just make the violence more extreme, as if you are goingt
&gt;&gt; o be put to death, you might as well murder your victims and get rid of
&gt;&gt; the #1 eye-witness.

&gt; Or maybe... just maybe... the violent criminal would think that mugging
&gt; little old ladies on the street for $40 isn't worth risking getting caught
&gt; when the penalty could be death.
">

The more draconian the punishment, the harder the crimes will become. it
wouldn't be a mugging for $40, it would be a murder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; He's a threat to horses and deer all right....but 'society'?

&gt; There you go with your assumptions again. Let me ask you this... after he
&gt; killed and fucked the horse corpse, did anything think he was a threat to
&gt; deer? Not using your logic. But look what happened.
">

It's still him vs. an animal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; So cast him out from society where he can't hurt anyone?
&gt;&gt; Not that he's hurt anyone to start with.......

&gt; Not yet.
">

And neither have you. Should you be treated like a child rapist murderer
because mabye,sometime in the future, you might possibly do the crime?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a bad idea. Can
&gt;&gt;&gt; we put a big cage around him? Or maybe chain him up? Or how about a shock
&gt;&gt;&gt; collar with an electric fence?

&gt;&gt; Why would he need any of those.....he's killing deer, not people.

&gt; Hurting animals is a common behavior for most serial killers before they
&gt; claim their first human victim. But maybe this guy's different. Maybe he
&gt; &quot;loves&quot; those animals.

Maybe he does.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy your job? Different strokes for different folks. Remember,
&gt;&gt; someones got to do your dirty work when it comes to the death penalty.
&gt;&gt; Why not use a murderer to kill people, eh?

&gt; Nope. I don't like that one bit. Sure I enjoy my job. Enjoy it enough not to
&gt; leave it, anyway. People who commit crimes should NOT be rewarded for it.

carry out the death sentence is more of a function, than a reward. What
better person for the job than a convicted murderer?

&gt;&gt; maybe after the first couple of hundred he would be sick of the

A cry for help? nah, he just gets his rocks off humping dead animals.
