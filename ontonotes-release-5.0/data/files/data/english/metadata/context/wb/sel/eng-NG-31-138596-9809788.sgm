PSYCHOPATHS AMONG US

Dr. Robert Hare claims there are 300,000 psychopaths in Canada, but
that only a tiny fraction are violent offenders like Paul Bernardo and
Clifford Olsen. Who are the rest? Take a look around

By Robert Hercz

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

&quot;Psychopath! psychopath!&quot;

I'm alone in my living room and I'm yelling at my TV. &quot;Forget
rehabilitation -- that guy is a psychopath.&quot;

Ever since I visited Dr. Robert Hare in Vancouver, I can see them, the
psychopaths. It's pretty easy, once you know how to look. I'm watching
a documentary about an American prison trying to rehabilitate teen
murderers. They're using an emotionally intense kind of group therapy,
and I can see, as plain as day, that one of the inmates is a
psychopath. He tries, but he can't muster a convincing breakdown,
can't fake any feeling for his dead victims. He's learned the words,
as Bob Hare would put it, but not the music.

The incredible thing, the reason I'm yelling, is that no one in this
documentary -- the therapists, the warden, the omniscient narrator --
seems to know the word &quot;psychopath.&quot; It is never uttered, yet it
changes everything. A psychopath can never be made to feel the horror
of murder. Weeks of intense therapy, which are producing real
breakthroughs in the other youths, will probably make a psychopath
more likely to reoffend. Psychopaths are not like the rest of us, and
everyone who studies them agrees they should not be treated as if they
were.

I think of Bob Hare, who's in New Orleans receiving yet another award,
and wonder if he's watching the same show in his hotel room and
feeling the same frustration. A lifetime spent looking into the heads
of psychopaths has made the slight, slightly anxious emeritus
professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia the
world's best-known expert on the species. Hare hasn't merely changed
our understanding of psychopaths. It would be more accurate to say he
has created it.

The condition itself has been recognized for centuries, wearing
evocative labels such as &quot;madness without delirium&quot; and &quot;moral
insanity&quot; until the late 1800s, when &quot;psychopath&quot; was coined by a
German clinician. But the term (and its 1930s synonym, sociopath) had
always been a sort of catch-all, widely and loosely applied to
criminals who seemed violent and unstable. Even into the mid-1970s,
almost 80 percent of convicted felons in the United States were being
diagnosed as sociopaths. In 1980, Hare created a diagnostic tool
called the Psychopathy Checklist, which, revised five years later,
became known as the PCL-R. Popularly called &quot;the Hare,&quot; the PCL-R
measures psychopathy on a forty-point scale. Once it emerged, it was
the first time in history that everyone who said &quot;psychopath&quot; was
saying the same thing. For research in the field, it was like a
starting gun.

But for Hare, it has turned out to be a Pandora's box. Recently
retired from teaching, his very last Ph.D. student about to leave the
nest, Hare, sixty-eight, should be basking in professional accolades
and enjoying his well-earned rest. But he isn't.

The PCL-R has slipped the confines of academe, and is being used and
misused in ways that Hare never intended. In some of the places where
it could do some good -- such as the prison in the TV documentary I
was yelling at -- the idea of psychopathy goes unacknowledged, usually
because it's politically incorrect to declare someone to be beyond
rehabilitation. At the opposite extreme, there are cases in which
Hare's work has been overloaded with political baggage of another
sort, such as in the United States, where a high PCL-R score is used
to support death-penalty arguments, and in England, where a debate is
underway about whether some individuals with personality disorders
(such as psychopaths) should be detained even if they haven't
committed a crime.

So, after decades of labour in peaceful obscurity, Bob Hare has become
a man with a suitcase, a passport, and a PowerPoint presentation, a
reluctant celebrity at gatherings of judges, attorneys, prison
administrators, psychologists, and police. His post-retirement mission
is to be a good shepherd to his Psychopathy Checklist.

&quot;I'm protecting it from erosion, from distortion. It could easily be
compromised,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm a scientist; I should just be doing basic
research, but I'm being called on all the time to intervene and
mediate.&quot;

And it's really just beginning. Psychopathy may prove to be as
important a construct in this century as IQ was in the last (and just
as susceptible to abuse), because, thanks to Hare, we now understand
that the great majority of psychopaths are not violent criminals and
never will be. Hundreds of thousands of psychopaths live and work and
prey among us. Your boss, your boyfriend, your mother could be what
Hare calls a &quot;subclinical&quot; psychopath, someone who leaves a path of
destruction and pain without a single pang of conscience. Even more
worrisome is the fact that, at this stage, no one -- not even Bob Hare
-- is quite sure what to do about it.

Bob hare has to meet me in the lobby of the UBC psychology building,
since he's not listed in the directory. He's had threats, by e-mail
and in person. An ex-con showed up one day, angry that a friend of his
had been declared a dangerous offender thanks to Hare's checklist.
Other characters have appeared in his lab doorway, looking in and
saying nothing.

We immediately find ourselves discussing the criminal du jour, the jet-
setting French con man Christophe Rocancourt, notorious for passing
himself off as a member of the Rockefeller family, who has just been
arrested in Victoria.

&quot;I'd sure as hell like to have a close look at him,&quot; Hare muses.

Like every scientist, Hare likes a good puzzle, and that was reason
enough to make a career out of psychopaths. &quot;These were particularly
interesting human beings,&quot; he says. &quot;Everything about them seemed to
be paradoxical. They could do things that a lot of other people could
not do&quot; -- lie, steal, rape, murder -- &quot;but they looked perfectly
normal, and when you talked to them they seemed okay. It was a puzzle.
I thought I'd try and unravel it.&quot;

Hare arrived at UBC in 1963, intending to follow up his doctoral
research on punishment. Certain prisoners, it was rumoured, didn't
respond to punishment, and Hare went to the federal penitentiary in
New Westminster, British Columbia, to find these extreme cases. (He
found plenty. In his chilling 1993 book on psychopathy, Without
Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us, he
quotes one specimen's memories: &quot;[M]y mother, the most beautiful
person in the world. She was strong, she worked hard to take care of
four kids. A beautiful person. I started stealing her jewellery when I
was in the fifth grade. You know, I never really knew the bitch -- we
went our separate ways.&quot;)

For his first paper, now a classic, Hare had his subjects watch a
countdown timer. When it reached zero, they got a &quot;harmless but
painful&quot; electric shock while an electrode taped to their fingers
measured perspiration. Normal people would start sweating as the
countdown proceeded, nervously anticipating the shock. Psychopaths
didn't sweat. They didn't fear punishment -- which, presumably, also
holds true outside the laboratory. In Without Conscience, he quotes a
psychopathic rapist explaining why he finds it hard to empathize with
his victims: &quot;They are frightened, right? But, you see, I don't really
understand it. I've been frightened myself, and it wasn't
unpleasant.&quot;

In another Hare study, groups of letters were flashed to volunteers.
Some of them were nonsense, some formed real words. The subject's job
was to press a button whenever he recognized a real word, while Hare
recorded response time and brain activity. Non-psychopaths respond
faster and display more brain activity when processing emotionally
loaded words such as &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;cancer&quot; than when they see neutral
words such as &quot;tree.&quot; With psychopaths, Hare found no difference. To
them, &quot;rape&quot; and &quot;tree&quot; have the same emotional impact -- none.

Hare made another intriguing discovery by observing the hand gestures
(called beats) people make while speaking. Research has shown that
such gestures do more than add visual emphasis to our words (many
people gesture while they're on the telephone, for example); it seems
they actually help our brains find words. That's why the frequency of
beats increases when someone is having trouble finding words, or is
speaking a second language instead of his or her mother tongue. In a
1991 paper, Hare and his colleagues reported that psychopaths,
especially when talking about things they should find emotional, such
as their families, produce a higher frequency of beats than normal
people. It's as if emotional language is a second language -- a
foreign language, in effect -- to the psychopath.

Three decades of these studies, by Hare and others, has confirmed that
psychopaths' brains work differently from ours, especially when
processing emotion and language. Hare once illustrated this for Nicole
Kidman, who had invited him to Hollywood to help her prepare for a
role as a psychopath in Malice. How, she wondered, could she show the
audience there was something fundamentally wrong with her character?

&quot;I said, 'Here's a scene that you can use,' &quot; Hare says. &quot; 'You're
walking down a street and there's an accident. A car has hit a child
in the crosswalk. A crowd of people gather round. You walk up, the
child's lying on the ground and there's blood running all over the
place. You get a little blood on your shoes and you look down and say,
&quot;Oh shit.&quot; You look over at the child, kind of interested, but you're
not repelled or horrified. You're just interested. Then you look at
the mother, and you're really fascinated by the mother, who's emoting,
crying out, doing all these different things. After a few minutes you
turn away and go back to your house. You go into the bathroom and
practice mimicking the facial expressions of the mother.' &quot; He then
pauses and says, &quot;That's the psychopath: somebody who doesn't
understand what's going on emotionally, but understands that something
important has happened.&quot;

Hare's research upset a lot of people. Until the psychopath came into
focus, it was possible to believe that bad people were just good
people with bad parents or childhood trauma and that, with care, you
could talk them back into being good. Hare's research suggested that
some people behaved badly even when there had been no early trauma.
Moreover, since psychopaths' brains were in fundamental ways different
from ours, talking them into being like us might not be easy. Indeed,
to this day, no one has found a way to do so.

&quot;Some of the things he was saying about these individuals, it was
unheard of,&quot; says Dr. Steven Stein, a psychologist and ceo of Multi-
Health Systems in Toronto, the publisher of the Psychopathy Checklist.
&quot;Nobody believed him thirty years ago, but Bob hasn't wavered, and now
everyone's where he is. Everyone's come full circle, except a small
group who believe it's bad upbringing, family poverty, those kinds of
factors, even though scientific evidence has shown that's not the
case. There are wealthy psychopaths who've done horrendous things, and
they were brought up in wonderful families.&quot;

&quot;There's still a lot of opposition -- some criminologists,
sociologists, and psychologists don't like psychopathy at all,&quot; Hare
says. &quot;I can spend the entire day going through the literature -- it's
overwhelming, and unless you're semi-brain-dead you're stunned by it
-- but a lot of people come out of there and say, 'So what?
Psychopathy is a mythological construct.' They have political and
social agendas: 'People are inherently good,' they say. 'Just give
them a hug, a puppy dog, and a musical instrument and they're all
going to be okay.' &quot;

If Hare sounds a little bitter, it's because a decade ago,
Correctional Service of Canada asked him to design a treatment program
for psychopaths, but just after he submitted the plan in 1992, there
were personnel changes at the top of CSC. The new team had a different
agenda, which Hare summarizes as, &quot;We don't believe in the badness of
people.&quot; His plan sank without a trace.

By the late 1970s, after fifteen years in the business, Bob Hare knew
what he was looking for when it came to psychopaths. They exhibit a
cluster of distinctive personality traits, the most significant of
which is an utter lack of conscience. They also have huge egos, short
tempers, and an appetite for excitement -- a dangerous mix. In a
typical prison population, about 20 percent of the inmates satisfy the
Hare definition of a psychopath, but they are responsible for over
half of all violent crime.

The research community, Hare realized, lacked a standard definition.
&quot;I found that we were all talking a different language, we were on
different diagnostic pages, and I decided that we had to have some
common instrument,&quot; he says. &quot;The PCL-R was really designed to make it
easier to publish articles and to let journal editors and reviewers
know what I meant by psychopathy.&quot;

The Psychopathy Checklist consists of a set of forms and a manual that
describes in detail how to score a subject in twenty categories that
define psychopathy. Is he (or, more rarely, she) glib and
superficially charming, callous and without empathy? Does he have a
grandiose sense of self worth, shallow emotions, a lack of remorse or
guilt? Is he impulsive, irresponsible, promiscuous? Did he have
behavioural problems early in life? The information for each category
must be carefully drawn from documents such as court transcripts,
police reports, psychologists' reports, and victim-impact statements,
and not solely from an interview, since psychopaths are superb liars
(&quot;pathological lying&quot; and &quot;conning/manipulative&quot; are PCL-R
categories). A prisoner may claim to love his family, for example,
while his records show no visits or phone calls.

For each item, assessors -- psychologists or psychiatrists -- assign a
score of zero (the item doesn't apply), one (the item applies in some
respects), or two (the item applies in most respects). The maximum
possible score is forty, and the boundary for clinical psychopathy
hovers around thirty. Last year, the average score for all
incarcerated male offenders in North America was 23.3. Hare guesses
his own score would be about four or five.

In 1980, Hare's initial checklist began circulating in the research
community, and it quickly became the standard. At last count nearly
500 papers and 150 doctoral dissertations had been based on it.

It's also found practical applications in police-squad rooms. Soon
after he delivered a keynote speech at a conference for homicide
detectives and prosecuting attorneys in Seattle three years ago, Hare
got a letter thanking him for helping solve a series of homicides. The
police had a suspect nailed for a couple of murders, but believed he
was responsible for others. They were using the usual strategy to get
a confession, telling him, 'Think how much better you'll feel, think
of the families left behind,' and so on. After they'd heard Hare speak
they realized they were dealing with a psychopath, someone who could
feel neither guilt nor sorrow. They changed their interrogation tactic
to, &quot;So you murdered a couple of prostitutes. That's minor-league
compared to Bundy or Gacy.&quot; The appeal to the psychopath's grandiosity
worked. He didn't just confess to his other crimes, he bragged about
them.

The most startling finding to emerge from Hare's work is that the
popular image of the psychopath as a remorseless, smiling killer --
Paul Bernardo, Clifford Olson, John Wayne Gacy -- while not wrong, is
incomplete. Yes, almost all serial killers, and most of Canada's
dangerous offenders, are psychopaths, but violent criminals are just a
tiny fraction of the psychopaths around us. Hare estimates that 1
percent of the population -- 300,000 people in Canada -- are
psychopaths.

He calls them &quot;subclinical&quot; psychopaths. They're the charming
predators who, unable to form real emotional bonds, find and use
vulnerable women for sex and money (and inevitably abandon them).
They're the con men like Christophe Rocancourt, and they're the
stockbrokers and promoters who caused Forbes magazine to call the
Vancouver Stock Exchange (now part of the Canadian Venture Exchange)
the scam capital of the world. (Hare has said that if he couldn't
study psychopaths in prisons, the Vancouver Stock Exchange would have
been his second choice.) A significant proportion of persistent wife
beaters, and people who have unprotected sex despite carrying the AIDS
virus, are psychopaths. Psychopaths can be found in legislatures,
hospitals, and used-car lots. They're your neighbour, your boss, and
your blind date. Because they have no conscience, they're natural
predators. If you didn't have a conscience, you'd be one too.

Psychopaths love chaos and hate rules, so they're comfortable in the
fast-moving modern corporation. Dr. Paul Babiak, an industrial-
organizational psychologist based near New York City, is in the
process of writing a book with Bob Hare called When Psychopaths Go to
Work: Cons, Bullies and the Puppetmaster. The subtitle refers to the
three broad classes of psychopaths Babiak has encountered in the
workplace.

&quot;The con man works one-on-one,&quot; says Babiak. &quot;They'll go after a
woman, marry her, take her money, then move on and marry someone else.
The puppet master would manipulate somebody to get at someone else.
This type is more powerful because they're hidden.&quot; Babiak says
psychopaths have three motivations: thrill-seeking, the pathological
desire to win, and the inclination to hurt people. &quot;They'll jump on
any opportunity that allows them to do those things,&quot; he says. &quot;If
something better comes along, they'll drop you and move on.&quot;

How can you tell if your boss is a psychopath? It's not easy, says
Babiak. &quot;They have traits similar to ideal leaders. You would expect
an ideal leader to be narcissistic, self-centred, dominant, very
assertive, maybe to the point of being aggressive. Those things can
easily be mistaken for the aggression and bullying that a psychopath
would demonstrate. The ability to get people to follow you is a
leadership trait, but being charismatic to the point of manipulating
people is a psychopathic trait. They can sometimes be confused.&quot;

Once inside a company, psychopaths can be hard to excise. Babiak tells
of a salesperson and psychopath -- call him John -- who was performing
badly but not suffering for it. John was managing his boss --
flattering him, taking him out for drinks, flying to his side when he
was in trouble. In return, his boss covered for him by hiding John's
poor performance. The arrangement lasted until John's boss was moved.
When his replacement called John to task for his abysmal sales
numbers, John was a step ahead.

He'd already gone to the company president with a set of facts he used
to argue that his new boss, and not he, should be fired. But he made a
crucial mistake. &quot;It was actually stolen data,&quot; Babiak says. &quot;The only
way [John] could have obtained it would be for him to have gone into a
file into which no one was supposed to go. That seemed to be enough,
and he was fired rather than the boss. Even so, in the end, he walked
out with a company car, a bag of money, and a good reference.&quot;

&quot;A lot of white-collar criminals are psychopaths,&quot; says Bob Hare. &quot;But
they flourish because the characteristics that define the disorder are
actually valued. When they get caught, what happens? A slap on the
wrist, a six-month ban from trading, and don't give us the $100
million back. I've always looked at white-collar crime as being as bad
or worse than some of the physically violent crimes that are
committed.&quot;

The best way to protect the workplace is not to hire psychopaths in
the first place. That means training interviewers so they're less
likely to be manipulated and conned. It means checking resumés for
lies and distortions, and it means following up references.

Paul Babiak says he's &quot;not comfortable&quot; with one researcher's estimate
that one in ten executives is a psychopath, but he has noticed that
they are attracted to positions of power. When he describes employees
such as John to other executives, they know exactly whom he's talking
about. &quot;I was talking to a group of human-resources executives
yesterday,&quot; says Babiak, &quot;and every one of them said, you know, I
think I've got somebody like that.&quot;

By now, you're probably thinking the same thing. The number of
psychopaths in society is about the same as the number of
schizophrenics, but unlike schizophrenics, psychopaths aren't loners.
That means most of us have met or will meet one. Hare gets dozens of
letters and e-mail messages every month from people who say they
recognize someone they know while reading Without Conscience. They go
on to describe a brother, a sister, a husband. &quot; 'Please help my
seventeen-year-old son. . . .' &quot; Hare reads aloud from one such
missive. &quot;It's a heart-rending letter, but what can I do? I'm not a
clinician. I have hundreds of these things, and some of them are
thirty or forty pages long.&quot;

Hare's book opened my eyes, too. Reading it, I realized that I might
have known a psychopath, Jonathan, at the computer company where I
worked in London, England, over twenty years ago. He was charming and
confident, and from the moment he arrived he was on excellent terms
with the executive inner circle. Jonathan had big plans and promised
me that I was a big part of them. One night when I was alone in the
office, Jonathan appeared, accompanied by what anyone should have
recognized as two prostitutes. &quot;These are two high-ranking staff from
the Ministry of Defence,&quot; he said without missing a beat. &quot;We're going
over the details of a contract, which I'm afraid is classified top
secret. You'll have to leave the building.&quot; His voice and eyes were
absolutely persuasive and I complied. A few weeks later Jonathan was
arrested. He had embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from the small
firm, used the company as a mailing address for a marijuana importing
business he was running on the side, and robbed the apartment of the
company's owner, who was letting him stay there temporarily.

Like everyone who has been suckered by a psychopath -- and Bob Hare
includes himself and many of his graduate students (who have been
trained to spot them) in that list -- I'm ashamed that I fell for
Jonathan. But he was brilliant, charismatic, and audacious. He
radiated money and power (though in fact he had neither), while his
real self -- manipulative, lying, parasitic, and irresponsible -- was
just far enough under his surface to be invisible. Or was it? Maybe I
didn't know how to look, or maybe I didn't really want to.

I saw his name in the news again recently. &quot;A con man tricked top
sports car makers Lotus into lending him a £70,000 model . . . then
stole it and drove 6,000 miles across Europe, a court heard,&quot; the
story began.

Knowing Jonathan is probably a psychopath makes me feel better. It's
an explanation.

But away from the workplace, back in the world of the criminally
violent psychopath, Hare's checklist has become broadly known, so
broadly known, in fact, that it is now a constant source of concern
for him. &quot;People are misusing it, and they're misusing it in really
strange ways,&quot; Hare says. &quot;There are lots of clinicians who don't even
have a manual. All they've seen is an article with the twenty items --
promiscuity, impulsiveness, and so forth -- listed.&quot;

In court, assessments of the same person done by defence and
prosecution &quot;experts&quot; have varied by as much as twenty points. Such
drastic differences are almost certainly the result of bias or
incompetence, since research on the PCL-R itself has shown it has high
&quot;inter-rater reliability&quot; (consistent results when a subject is
assessed by more than one qualified assessor). In one court case, it
was used to label a thirteen-year-old a psychopath, even though the
PCL-R test is only meant to be used to rate adults with criminal
histories. The test should be administered only by mental-health
professionals (like all such psychological instruments, it is only for
sale to those with credentials), but a social worker once used the PCL-
R in testimony in a death-penalty case -- not because she was
qualified but because she thought it was &quot;interesting.&quot;

It shouldn't be used in death-penalty cases at all, Hare says, but
U.S. Federal District Courts have ruled it admissible because it meets
scientific standards.

&quot;Bob and others like myself are saying it doesn't meet the ethical
standards,&quot; says Dr. Henry Richards, a psychopathy researcher at the
University of Washington. &quot;A psychological instrument and diagnosis
should not be a determinant of whether someone gets the death
sentence. That's more of an ethical and political decision.&quot;

And into the ethical and political realm -- the realm of
extrapolation, of speculation, of opinion -- Hare will not step. He's
been asked to be a guest on Oprah (twice), 60 Minutes, and Larry King
Live. Oprah wanted him alongside a psychopath and his victim. &quot;I said,
'This is a circus,' &quot; Hare says. &quot;I couldn't do that.&quot; 60 Minutes also
wanted to &quot;make it sexy&quot; by throwing real live psychopaths into the
mix. Larry King Live phoned him at home while O. J. Simpson was
rolling down the freeway in his white Bronco. Hare says no every time
(while his publisher gently weeps).

Even in his particular area, Hare is unfailingly circumspect. Asked if
he thinks there will ever be a cure for psychopathy -- a drug, an
operation -- Hare steps back and examines the question. &quot;The
psychopath will say 'A cure for what?' I don't feel comfortable
calling it a disease. Much of their behaviour, even the
neurobiological patterns we observe, could be because they're using
different strategies to get around the world. These strategies don't
have to involve faulty wiring, just different wiring.&quot;

Are these people qualitatively different from us? &quot;I would think yes,&quot;
says Hare. &quot;Do they form a discrete taxon or category? I would say
probably -- the evidence is suggesting that. But does this mean that's
because they have a broken motor? I don't know. It could be a natural
variation.&quot; True saints, completely selfless individuals, are rare and
unnatural too, he points out, but we don't talk about their being
diseased.

Psychopathy research is raising more questions than it can answer, and
many of them are leading to moral and ethical quagmires. For example:
the PCL-R has turned out to be the best single predictor of recidivism
that has ever existed; an offender with a high PCL-R score is three or
four times more likely to reoffend than someone with a low score.
Should a high PCL-R score, then, be sufficient grounds for denying
parole? Or perhaps a psychopathy test could be used to prevent crime
by screening individuals or groups at high risk -- for example, when
police get a frantic &quot;My boyfriend says he'll kill me&quot; call, or when a
teacher reports a student threatening to commit violence. Should
society institutionalize psychopaths, even if they haven't broken the
law?

The United Kingdom, partly in response to the 1993 abduction and
murder of two-year-old James Bulger by two ten-year-olds, and partly
in response to PCL-R data, is in the process of creating a new legal
classification called Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder
(DSPD). As it stands, the government proposes to allow authorities to
detain people declared DSPD, even if they have not committed a crime.
(Sample text from one of the Web sites that have sprung up in
response: &quot;I was diagnosed with an untreatable personality disorder by
a doctor who saw me for ten minutes, he later claimed I was a
psychopath. . . . Please don't let them do this to me; don't let them
do it to anybody. I'm not a danger to the public, nor are most
mentally ill people.&quot;)

Hare is a consultant on the DSPD project, and finds the potential for
abuse of power horrifying. So do scientists such as Dr. Richard Tees,
head of psychology at UBC, a colleague of Hare's since 1965. &quot;I am
concerned about our political masters deciding that the PCL-R is the
silver bullet that's going to fix everything,&quot; he says. &quot;We'll let
people out [of prison] on the basis of scores on this, and we'll put
them in. And we'll take children who do badly on some version of this
and segregate them or something. It wasn't designed to do any of these
things. The problems that politicians are trying to solve are
fundamentally more complicated than the one that Bob has solved.&quot;

So many of these awkward questions would vanish if only there were a
functioning treatment program for psychopathy. But there isn't. In
fact, several studies have shown that existing treatment makes
criminal psychopaths worse. In one, psychopaths who underwent social-
skills and anger-management training before release had an 82 percent
reconviction rate. Psychopaths who didn't take the program had a 59
percent reconviction rate. Conventional psychotherapy starts with the
assumption that a patient wants to change, but psychopaths are usually
perfectly happy as they are. They enrol in such programs to improve
their chances of parole. &quot;These guys learn the words but not the
music,&quot; Hare says. &quot;They can repeat all the psychiatric jargon -- 'I
feel remorse,' they talk about the offence cycle -- but these are
words, hollow words.&quot;

Hare has co-developed a new treatment program specifically for violent
psychopaths, using what he knows about the psychopathic personality.
The idea is to encourage them to be better by appealing not to their
(non-existent) altruism but to their (abundant) self-interest.

&quot;It's not designed to change personality, but to modify behaviour by,
among other things, convincing them that there are ways they can get
what they want without harming others,&quot; Hare explains. The program
will try to make them understand that violence is bad, not for
society, but for the psychopath himself. (Look where it got you:
jail.) A similar program will soon be put in place for psychopathic
offenders in the UK.

&quot;The irony is that Canada could have had this all set up and they
could have been leaders in the world. But they dropped the ball
completely,&quot; Hare says, referring to his decade-old treatment
proposal, sitting on a shelf somewhere within Corrections Canada.

Even if Hare's treatment program works, it will only address the
violent minority of psychopaths. What about the majority, the
subclinical psychopaths milling all around us? At the moment, the only
thing Hare and his colleagues can offer is self-protection through
self-education. Know your own weaknesses, they advise, because the
psychopath will find and use them. Learn to recognize the psychopath,
they tell us, before adding that even experts are regularly taken in.

After thirty-five years of work, Bob Hare has brought us to the stage
where we know what psychopathy is, how much damage psychopaths do, and
even how to identify them. But we don't know how to treat them or
protect the population from them. The real work is just beginning.
Solving the puzzle of the psychopath is an invigorating prospect -- if
you're a scientist. Perhaps the rest of us can be forgiven for our
impatience to see the whole thing come to an end.
