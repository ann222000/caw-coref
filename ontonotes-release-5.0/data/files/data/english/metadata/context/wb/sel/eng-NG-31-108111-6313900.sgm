I've had my border collie 3 months, since she was 8 wks old.  Before I
learned about the praise methods I used my old system and she already
responds pretty well to the old loud NO command that mostly stops her in
her tracks when she's running full speed at the inadvertently open gate
toward the deep growl of a HD motorcycle or a Cummins diesel lumbering
by.  I'm pretty sure shaking a rattle at her just then would not do the
trick, and might cost her her life. Similarly, when she is attacking a
subterranean critter, tossing the can right near her just causes a
slight flinch as she continues gleefully drilling down into the sod,
grass and dirt flying.

Re the other issue, I've been hanging around the sci.med.vision
newsgroup for over 15 years, and have never been insulted by receiving
direct inquiries from people who would rather keep their problems
private, nor have I ever been told I had insulted anyone when I had
discreetly e-mailed them some advice directly.

BTW I've never used a killfile.  I just skip over spam, trash and troll
bait. I wouldn't want to miss a diamond in the rough.

Anyway, I will make one small observation.  There are some up tight
people on this group.   Relax.  Life's too short.  I just got back from
a funeral (Sue McNew, the 2nd grade teacher who was killed by the
teenaged racers in Folsom, CA was a friend of mine).  Enjoy and love
your dogs, your spouses, and your kids while you have them. You won't
always have them.

It's not necessarily an issue of being insulted, though that may
certainly be the case.  I know that I do not particularly care to
get private newsgroup-related e-mail from people I don't "know."
The bigger issue, though, is that this is a public discussion
forum.  Encouraging on-topic discussions to be taken to e-mail does
the group a disservice.  Really.  If you are looking for someone to
exchange e-mail with, there are a metric arseload of mail lists out
there.  Or, if you want to discuss the resident loon's "methods"
with him, why don't you contact *him* directly?  Because, like I
said, I doubt anyone else here is interested in that particular
topic.

HOWEDY People,

Here's a DISS-CUSSION abHOWET HOWE
to ANAL-WIZE and DISCREDIT the DHOWEBLE
TALK of traditional behaviorISTS:

Nevyn says: can u help me with a animal behaviors paper?
"Describe how Genetics, previous experience and present
environment can influence an individuals behaviour"

Jerry says:
that's a tough question

Jerry says:
the only effective way to address a tough question
is to ANAL-WIZE it and DISCREDIT THE QUESTION
and RESTATE IT CORRECTLY AS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.

Jerry says:
1) genetics ONLY PREDISPOSES an individual
to gentic propensities

2) pryor EXXXPERIENCE is EZily rehabilitated using
effective behavior modification techniques on accHOWENT
of "ALL BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY MISHANDLING.

A  DOG IS A DOG.

"The Methods, Principles, And Philosophy Of Behavior

3) Dogs kats and kids ONLY respond in PREDICTABLE
NORMAL INNATE NATURAL INSTINCTIVE REFLEXIVE WAYS
to situations and circumstances of their environments
which WE create for them.

ANY behavior that's CONSISTENT, PREDICTABLE and
REPEATABLE is EZ to EXXXTINGUISH NEARLY INSTANTLY,
if you know HOWE.

Jerry says:
EZ, hunh?

The Amazing Puppy Wizard sees that most dogs HERE,
suffering a myriad of diverse symptoms from seemingly
urinary tract infections and bladder stones, kidney,
endocrine, nervous system DIS-EASES and DIS-ORDERS,
psychogenic seizures, even periodontal DIS-EASE and
cataracts ARE CAUSED BY "traditional training" methods,
crate anxiHOWESNESS, ordinary corrections like JUST
TELLIN THE DOG "NO!" a couple times a day, and SCHEDULING,
are the CAUSE of ALL temperament and beahvior problems
and MOST DIS-EASE.

Death Producing Ulcers:
"Emotional Influences On Health &amp; Behavior"
Dr. George Von Hilsheimer

Illness is directly related to depression and lack of
adjustment, particularly to a new environment (Parens,
McConville &amp; Kaplan, 1966).

A WIDE RANGE of PSYCHOSOMATIC or
CORTICOVISCERAL DIS-EASES was surveyed
by Wittkower (1965) to demonstrate the enormous
importance of emotional factors in general health.

Interview findings of emotional material (recently
experienced hopelessness) pryor to biological
examinations correctly identified 11 out of 19 with
cervical cancer, and 25 of 32 who were cancer free
even though psychological tests failed to discriminate
these groups (Schmale &amp; Iker, 1966)

150 lung cancer patients showed significantly
constricted expression of emotions. The had fewer
childhood behavior problems, and lower neuroticism
score than their cancer free controls. Heavy cigarette
smokers who DO NOT INHALE are more apt to have LUNG
CANCER. They, too, show LOWER neuroticism scores.
Among heavy cigarette smokers poor emotional
expression is as highly related to cancer as urban
residence and is more important than a chronic cough
or an air polluted environment (Kissen, 1966).

A ten year observation of all the women who developed
cancer in an isolated pupulation of 2,550 showed that
they tended to be unstable or sub stable personalities
characterized by melancholy and extraversion,
especially marked with those of an undecided body
build (Hagll, 1966). Personality dynamics effect both
the development of cancer and it's SITE. Cancer
may result from what appears to be a failure to grow--
somatically, behaviorally and psychologically
(Grinker, 1966).

In 109 cases leukemia and lymphoma were associated
with a number of losses or separations and with
feelings of sadness, anxiety, anger or hopelessness.
The PRIMARY FACTOR seems to be the shame and
hopelessness of running out of psychological resources
(Green, 1966). Cervical cancer patients are less
emotionally responsive, more isolative, and less
frequently diagnosed as having clinical neuroses than
cancer free patients. There is NO CLEAR DIFFERENCE in
their FEELINGS and ATTITUDES toward coitus (Rotkin,
Qunk, &amp; Couchman, 1965).

Schmidt (1966) surveyed nearly 100 studies of
behaviorally induced DIS-EASE in animals CONFIRMING
and EXTENDING the DATA on PEOPLE. Behaviorally
induced DIS-EASES tend to fall into two groups;

(1) Hysteriform problems, which INCLUDE HYSTERICAL
SEIZURES and FORMS of AGGRESSION as well as
collective panic and epilepsies;

(2) organic modifications, including functional
difficulties
and lesions affecting gastro intestinal,

Discussion is only true if both sides of the discussion are willing to,
well, discuss. When one sides "discussion" abilities are limited to calling
you a dog-abusing thug, the discussion gets kinda old.

Note that I have added the tag [eggplant] to the header. FYI, that is a tag
added by the regs of the ng to allow others to filter out discussions of
Jerry's manual and his techinques. There are a large number of people who
want nothing to do with him or anything to do with him. Should you wish to
discuss him, or with him, I recommend placing [Jerry] or [eggplant] in your
subject line, so that people can filter on that, and not be forced to
filter you.

Hi, Jerry.

I'm not sure that I'm a 100% convert, or that I agree
with (or even understand) 100% of what you say in this
manual ... BUT ... we had "come" down pat in a few
reps and you could have knocked me down when I tried
the exercise with "drop" and, after a few reps in
different spots Darwin practically *threw* the rubber
ball at my feet on command. He's still not perfect
(just a pup, after all, and he's stubborn enough to
want to push and test me a little bit more).

For what it's worth, I can see (as no doubt you have)
how your usenet manner is likely to rankle a few
folks, but that woman who advocates ear pulling and
beating with sticks deserves everything she gets. Even
if that was the only method that would work, I'd live
with my dog not fetching rather than do any of that.

tho').

Hi Buzzsaw

Not a Thing to lose ...But a Lot To Gain!!

I can only speak from my experience.. I have a 8 month
old miniature poodle, and although I had done some basic
training with him we had a few barking issues  ..ugh

I am happy to tell you, I contacted Jerry at the email
addy I posted and he was so great! I wasn't following
the technique precisely but he helped me get back on track.

Beau is doing sooooo well it is really a thrill working
with him, and seeing the remarkable changes.

Now I can ask for "recall" (come) both on and off lead
and it is immediate!

the first time I ask.

Best of Luck to you,

Remember if you need help or explanation contact Jerry ..
he will be more than happy to help anyway he can.

Cheers

on going discussions with trainers from Triple Crown
and Dr Meister with out any help-and I found the ad
to Doggy Do Right and messaged Jerry to ask if this
might help my dog.

He said solving the aggression problem was EZ
but I could not believe him even when I downloaded
the manual.

The name of the method was right I was at my Wits End.
I had been working for 18 months!

Using the can sound three time he came, and still comes
from anywhere with the command-"comegoodboy"  Next
I tried the can when walking him--when he saw a dog three
blocks away he went off-lunging and snapping-I used the
can sound and he looked at me like uhn?

I used it three more times and we got to the other dog-
-the looked at me wagging his tail--the other person
looked at me like why are shaking that can but just
walked on by.

Re: Am I expecting to much

Hi Jerry,

When I talked to you on the phone to order to machine
for daughter's new pup, I told you that I had an older
Chessie.  I rescued him at 9 years old and have had
him for 3 years.

It's funny, but I thought I'd try some of your book
training with him. Where I used to say "come" and
then say "good boy" when he obeyed, I have reversed
it with a "good boy" first.

It really does work.

He was very confused at first, wondering what he
had done to get the praise.

But it really gets the attention and distracts him from
whatever he may have going through his brain when
he hears it.

Dogs are funny, but people are too.  Can't wait to get
the Doggy do Right, etc.

Thanks,

N

Fortunately, I happen to believe he is too.
I took a rescued three year old beagle that
had been kept outside all of its life that didn't
even recognize or respond to its name to
Jerry's home (That ugly cinder block shack???
get real) and in just over one hour of working
with the dog, he was coming on command
(not a quickly as he does now, but still...) and
walking with us on a loose lead.

His "hot/cold" exercise and "come when called"
command and pack exercise WORK!

Well, he's been near mine, and done wonders for him.

You don't have to like him.  You don't have

am concerned, I've never seen any other
training approach that was as fast and easy.

Some of his "methods" are common.  If I were wanting to have an
actual discussion about them, I'd divorce them from Howe.

Others of his "methods" are batshit crazy, and surely not anything
he cribbed from another source.  His advice, when he does bother to
give any, is often dangerous-to-lethal.

The thing is, Jerry is not a dog trainer.  If he were what he
claims to be, there would be some sort of independent evidence.
There is not.  No one--not even those in his local dog community--
has heard of him.

He originally started outright spamming the dog newsgroups with a
website, manual, and magic black box he purchased from a "get rich
quick on the web" company.  When his spamming was not met with a
favorable response, he started in with the crazy talk and the
around the clock cross-posting.  He's a scammer-spammer who lost
his mind somewhere along the way.  Perhaps it wasn't attached too

Howe goes beyond "a bit quirky" or "abrasive."  He's clearly got

toy with the disabled.  If you want to do so, knock yourself out.
But--like I said--just don't be surprised if no one wants to join

I think some of that is actually due to the resident loon.
Accountability can be a good thing.  If a discussion stays public,
then there's (usually) a record of it.

That doesn't mean there aren't behind-the-scenes e-mail discussions
happening, though.  There are.  Folks *do* seem to be pretty good at
asking permission first, though, which I think is nice.

And, just from a personal stand-point, I don't mind personal e-mail
from regulars, or even from lurkers or newcomers, if it's not rude
and obnoxious.  Sometimes it's about something off-topic or personal,
or about an old post someone found Googling.  That's absolutely fine
with me.

What I don't like is folks e-mailing me responses to current on-topic
discussions--which is what the OP was suggesting people do.  Whatever
on earth is the point of doing that?  If folks aren't interested in a
subject, why would they want to discuss it privately?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It used to be the case, and still is in other newsgroups I'm
familiar with, that when someone is just asking for the
answer to a question it's best to send it to them via email
rather than cluttering up the newsgroup.  Frequently asked
questions, and all that (for example, this dork's questions
have been asked over and over and over again, and it's
probably best to send him an answer via email rather than
open up yet another discussion about Jerry's foibles).  Back
in the day scarcity ruled, and it's more resource-friendly
not to send stuff that's not of general interest to every
NNTP server on the planet.

There are two things, I think, that have changed that: 1) a
non-techie user base that doesn't think about resource
consumption, and 2) people no longer including their email
addresses in the headers, which renders the entire question
moot.

Anyway, when I were a sprout it was considered rude to post
stuff that could be emailed rather than vice versa, and I
think in most newsgroups, at least in the technical
newsgroups, email is a non-issue.

I can understand that.  I belong to groups where private contact is
pretty much SOP.  And it *still* weirds me out a little.  But
that's just me.  I have caller ID, but no answering machine.  I
want to know if someone called, but I don't necessarily want to be
responsible for calling them back.  Personal e-mail requires a
higher commitment than public, group discussion.

One thing that has occurred to me--and this really has nothing to

taking discussion elsewhere leaches from the group.  One of my
former favorite newsgroups is now pretty much dead.  It was way
busier than rpd* has ever been, even at its peak.  But then LJ and

Its not about being "a bit abrasive". Would it be a "bit abrasive" if I
spent hundreds of hours following you around screaming at everyone
around you that you killed your last dog by abusing it? That's way more
than "a bit abrasive". He has spent countless hours trying to outright
ruin people who's only crime is that they called him on his abuse and
wouldn't jump on his bandwagon. He used to compliment my trasining
advice (he'll tell you it was because I'm friends in real life with one
of his acolytes, but this was before any of us were aware of that
connection). He stopped comp[limenting me, and started calling me a thug
ONLY when I posted that I knew, firsthand, that his magic black box
didn't actually work (and this was verified by that same acolyte. It
was, at that point gathering dust in his closet). Once I posted that,
the same advice I had been getting compliments for for years was
suddenly abusive. Weird, hunh?

If you choose to be an apologist for the sort of criminal behavior that
involves stalking (and not just on the internet), slander and libel,
then by all means....no one here is going to stop you. But I'm not going
to sit back while you paint a very misguided picture of why he says what
he says. You're being manipulated. So, whatever. As long as your dog
gets humanely trained, then I really don't care.

But for you to make insinuations solely based on what you're being told
(and most likely lied to) by one nutjob who lost credibility almost a
decade ago.....well, that's going a bit far, don't you think?

People here tried to give you advice that works. You chose another path.
That's fine.....and no one here really cares about that. But for you to
imply that no one will discuss distraction methods....well, that's just
crap. Its discussed all the time. As are many other methods. We just
won't discuss the [eggplant] because after almost a decade we've learned
that its not only pointless, but abusive to people here.

Good luck with that

I'm sure the OP doesn't realize the toll the troll has taken on this
group. I know he has run me off a few times. I *like* a lot of the
regulars here, but the whole group does sometimes get pretty
disfunctional due to his influence, even if most people killfile him.
IMO the more amazing thing is that he *hasn't* killed off rpdb, as he
has r.p.d.activities and r.p.d.misc. With all the other options (I bled
off to subscription email groups mostly) it's a credit to the
compatibility of the regulars that they persevere. But when a newbie
happens in without understanding the decade of history and stirs it all
up again, well, we do tend to get pretty snappish.

BTW, to the OP, my dogs *love* for me to throw things at them, so much
that it does distract them from mischeif. But without the rattling can
hoopla and conditioned reflex mumbo-jumbo, I can just cut to the chase
and toss a toy or ball near them to interrupt some undesirable act.
Like right now, I filled low spots in my yard with sand and until I sod
it, the cats  in the neighborhood think I installed them a giant litter
box. My dogs think it's a giant smorgusboard &lt;blech!&gt; ;-P So when we go
out there, I'm ready to distract with a retrieve. But not of a bent-up
can with pennies in it, although my OCD retrievers would just go after
anything I threw!

Subject: Re: Q: shock collars for barking?
Date: 1995/05/25

I've had an experience with this type of collar.  My boxer/pit
bull is a nuisance barker and will bark at anything and
everything, especially when my husband's not home, which is
particularly nerve racking when he is out of town.

A friend of mine has one of these collars and offered to loan
it to me for awhile.  Well, I put the collar on Dinsdale and
the first time she barked she received a shock, went into a
corner of the kitchen crouched down to what I would equate to
a fetal position and shivered terribly.

This is a very bold dog and to see her like this was horrible.

I took the collar off and tried it myself.  Holding it in one
hand, I tapped the sensors  and through that d*mn thing across
the room the shock was so  powerful.  Needless to say I did not
put the collar back on my  dog, she recovered from this awful
mistake mama made and barks on to this day.

I am not shooting this concept down.  This is only one
experience on one dog.  Even though you say you live far from
a city, consider renting a collar if possible.  That way if
you have a similar experience you won't be out a couple
hundred bucks.

Good luck,

I'm interested to hear what others have to say on this subject.

Well, time to add my 2 cents (Canadian, so
about half a cent american) worth. When I
first started looking into getting a dog,
I wandered out on the net and found info on
a prong collar, and when I looked at it, it
looked like this HORRID thing designed to hurt dogs.

Then, I saw on some show (don't remember which)
info on choke-collars vs. prong collars. The host
actually put one of each on HIMSELF and tried it.

HE found that the choke collar did what it was designed
to do, choke the living daylights out of whoever has it on.

The prong collar on the other hand provided even
pressure all the way around the neck, and he could
take a lot harder of a pull before it got really uncomfortable.

Well I appreciate all the responses, and think I have a pretty good
handle on what's going on.  It seems that Jerry wants to be the alpha
male of this group, but he doesn't practice the gentle methods he uses
with animals on the denizens of newsgroups.  In fact he kind of imitates
the methods of those he decries. In the words of a famous abusee and
abuser, too bad "we all just can't get along?". Deep down Jerry knows
that the abusive tirades will not work, and maybe he will eventually
apply his ideas to the group in a kinder more gentle way.

Anyway, it's been fun and I'll probably drop back in once more for a
report on how the technique has worked out for Emma and me.  One thing
for sure, it is not an easy thing for me to learn/master, and I can see
why people give up on it.

Right now, I gotta go work and play with her...

I'm a geek, too, but great at social stuff.  I just prefer to be anti-
social when I can get away with it.  Oddly, a lot of climbers are similarly
anti-social, but climbing is not a solo endeavor (unless you have a death

At 8 months he still gets me up at 5am.

But if she's getting less frequent, puppy vaginitis,
especially in little girly puppies is so common, it's
pretty much expected in some breeds might be suspected..

It's excruciatingly painful and can lead to renal
disease or many other issues if untreated.

I'd make an appointment with your vet for a re-visit

The fact that you are concerned is sufficient reason
to raise red flags that something needs evaluated with

I plan on crating Tuck whenever NOT supervised (which isn't often..
he usually is with me) Until the day that he quits tearing apart
everything in sight when I leave the room.

A dog proof room doesn't work.

He's figured out door knobs. He's figured  out cupboards,
and he loves to tug open dresser drawers.  He's not
interested  in anything  left out in the open.

He's into treasure hunting, figuring  anything worth
secreting away is worth his effort discovering. He's
discovered the sock stash is in drawers.

Trash cans? --not interested.
Counter tops? --not interested
Counter tops -with food? --not interested
Dog food sitting on the floorin open bags? --not interested

razor blades from bathroom drawers?  ...  Very cool stuff!

Mom really gets bent too!

nope.. His crate is going to be occupied for some time to come.

As for the beagle.. She's never been trustworthy.

She's getting senile and never will be trustworthy, so a
crate is in her future until she crosses the bridge.

Reka, no crate at no time,  She lost her crate when she was
5 months old.  Both Tuck, and reka hangout in  crates by choice.

Reka dens in the bathtub usually. (kind of a crate) But she
likes the beagles vantage point, because the beagles crate
is on top of Tuck's. Right next to the window so she can see
out.  Tuck prefers the compartment with a view as well.

I always have to vacate him (even though the crate on top is
too small for both elkhounds, it's their preferred lookout)
when I wantto stick in the beagle.

Reka sleeps under the bed at night or in the bathtub at night
if it's really hot. She sleeps in the  bathtub by day when not
watching from the penthouse suite.

Tuck is not crated at night, and has chosen to sleep in
the closet. The beagle holds down the couch, night and day.

5 days AFTER his distemper shot. (I had it done at
humane society vaccine clinic) My vet recommends the
distemper shot being given separately. yes,it takes
another trip to the vet.

The distemper shot is well known forcausing vaccine
reactions and even auto-immune response. (well thats
what vaccines DO..is kickin the auto-immune system)

But over loading an immune system  can cause unwanted
reactions. In Tuck,it took the form of HOD/PANO.

There has to be some genetic predisposition to auto-immune
response as well. Tuck's Daddy had bad food allergies.  (an
auto-immune response) and that should have alerted me toa
predisposition.

But I didn't realize the distemper shot would set off a
change of reactions that will last for  one to two years.

My vet says, NEXT year, to be sure to re-vaccinate him with
the same distemper  company that manufactured the distemper
shot that he recieved that caused the problem. Make sure he
recieves the distemper shot SEPARATELY  from the rest.

Part of his treatment protocal is toFeed him large breed
puppy  food (even though he is not a large breed dog) to
slow his growth.

So yes. in answer to your question, I have experienced a

"Aye" am in favor of that.

Actually, depending on the newsreader perhaps, only the headers are
downloaded, and I think even with a killfile the entire header is still
downloaded, but then moved to the bit-bucket. I usually just mark Jerry's
posts as "read", so the entire 10K to 200K of old crap never bloats my hard
drive. Once in a while I read some of Jerry's posts. I've only been here
for about 7 months, and some of the history he digs up is interesting. He
even dug up a ng post I made over 10 years ago, elsewhere, for some crazy
reason.

&gt; Hey Suja, I took a look at the page briefly, and here
&gt; are my comments as I read it: http://www.vetcures.com/
&gt; The guy who developped this product is a human physician. Humans are not
&gt; dogs. Drugs that work for humans may not work for dogs and vice-versa.
&gt; The intro also uses a lot of loaded words to try to make people feel
&gt; guilty about choosing pharmaceuticals over natural products.
&gt; Arthritis cannot be reversed nor can it be cured (from www.arthritis.ca ).
&gt; There are natural fluctuations in the course of the disease that may
&gt; result in the artritis appear to be cured. (In humans)
&gt; The clinical study - Well, first of all the fact that over 6 months,
&gt; those that didn't take it showed no fluctuations in their symtoms I find
&gt; hard to believe. Also, how do you tell, on a scale from 1-10, what level
&gt; your dog is at? How were the dogs chosen? Were the levels of activity the
&gt; same? There are a lot of questions about the trial that make me put it
&gt; down to wishful thinking.
&gt; &quot;It allows nutrients to intereact with one another, breaking them down
&gt; into the simplest ionic forms. This ultimately has a positive effect on
&gt; regenerating joint and tissue repair.&quot;
&gt; I call bullshit. So far, *no* biochemist, biologist or scientist has been
&gt; able to come up with anything that can come close the the effectiveness
&gt; of enzymes. And natural products don't work as well either. For him to
&gt; claim otherwise is a lie.
&gt; He also makes some interesting claims that are contradictory. First that
&gt; it is small and low molecular weight, and then that it detoxifies by
&gt; chelating. To chelate something, it needs to be (relatively) large, and
&gt; thus not a low molecular weight and not small. (Note, this all depends on
&gt; what molecular weight range he is talking about.)
&gt; &quot;The properties in ArthrotolT bind with the pollutants,
&gt; which catalyzes the breakdown of these toxic pollutants.&quot;
&gt; This sentance just makes no sense at all.

From an unrelated site http://tinyurl.com/rbl8j :

Fulvic- the Super Antioxidant

For an antioxidant to bind to a free-radical, the antioxidant
molecule must have unpaired electrons of equal and opposite
charge to that of the unpaired electrons of the free radical.

The beauty of Fulvic is that it is a bi-directional super
antioxidant that carries both a negative and a positive charge.

It can act as an acceptor or a donor in the creation of
electrochemical balance.  If it encounters free-radicals
with unpaired positive electrons, it supplies an equal
and opposite negative charge to neutralize the bad effects
of the free radicals.  Likewise, if the free-radicals carry
a negative charge, the Fulvic molecule can supply positive
unpaired electrons to nullify that charge.  Fulvic is such
a powerful, natural electrolyte that it can eradicate any
form of free radical."

EXXXCEPT WHEN THEY AIN'T, marcel the imbecile:

The Nobel Prize in Physics 1948

Presentation Speech by Professor G. Ising,
member of the Nobel Committee for Physics

"Anderson had at the time succeeded in obtaining a few photographs,
showing the temporary existence of free positive electrons. These
electrons, on account of their strong tendency to fuse with negative
ones, seemed to exist free in a space filled with matter, only as
long as they move at a great speed."

You can SKIP the BORING DETAILS:

The Nobel Prize in Physics 1948

Presentation Speech by Professor G. Ising,
member of the Nobel Committee for Physics
Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen.

According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, the Nobel Prize for
Physics may be awarded for "discovery or invention in the field of
physics".

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in awarding this years' prize
to Professor P.M.S. Blackett of Manchester, for his development of the
Wilson method and his discoveries, made by this method, in nuclear
physics and on cosmic radiation, indicates by the very wording of the
award, that its decision is motivated on both the grounds mentioned in
the statutes.

Particular weight may perhaps, in this case, be laid on the discoveries
made, but these only became possible by Blackett's development of
the method and the apparatus.

Experimental research on the different kinds of rays appearing in
nuclear physics has always been based to a great extent on the
power of an electrically charged atomic particle, when moving at
high speed, to ionize the gas through which it passes, i.e. to split
a number of gas molecules along its path into positive and negative
ions. Thus, one is able to count the number of particles by means
of the Geiger-counter tube; such a counter being a special, very
sensitive kind of ionization chamber, in which even a few ions
produced by the ray are sufficient to release a short-lived discharge
by an avalanche-like process.

But the whole course of the particle appears infinitely more clearly by
the method invented by C.T.R. Wilson in 1911 and named after him.
The radiation is allowed to enter an expansion-chamber, containing a
gas saturated with water vapour. A sudden expansion of the chamber
cools the gas, and cloud-drops are then formed instantly around the
ions produced along the tracks of the particles.

By suitable illumination these tracks can be made to stand out
clearly as if they had been described by luminous projectiles. The
"Altmeister" of modern nuclear physics, Lord Rutherford, once called
the Wilson chamber "the most original and wonderful instrument in
scientific history".

But still, the immense value of the Wilson method for research purposes
did not become really apparent until the early twenties, and the credit
for
this changed attitude was largely due to the work of Blackett, who has
ever
since been the leading man in the development of the method. Before
1932
his work dealt chiefly with the heavy particles, appearing in
radioactive
radiations.

In 1925, he obtained the first photographs ever taken of a nuclear
disruption, namely the disruption of a nitrogen nucleus by an alpha
particle of high velocity; the

It has been a couple of months since we have initiated Jerry Howe's
recommendations for resolving the separation anxiety in our 8 y.o.
chocolate lab.

We have seen remarkable results.

She can now be left on our houseboat and we can return with
all of the wood trim and/or blinds intact. Before we spoke with
Jerry and started the training, we could not leave her without
her barking in a high pitch incessantly.

I had resorted to "building her a pen" with pieces of chair railing,
putting chairs in front of windows, and moving the bed so that she
could not get to the blind (again!). It would take about 10-15 minutes
of planning and moving things before we could leave.

Even with that, she would find something to destroy. We NOW
use the surrogate toy method and can go out, shop, go to dinner
or whatever, without any problems.

She is glad to see us when we return, but no longer frantic.

I am so happy that this seems to be the norm now.

Another problem that we had with her was although she would
not destroy the house, she would leave us runny poop in several
places.(kind of the same as destroy I guess). I tried to blame this
on her diet, but realized that her anxiety level was so high that
she just had no control. Now, the only time that she has done
that is when she devoured a diaper from the trash!!!

Jerry's methods work. I found him by typing in separation
anxiety+orlando florida into Google, otherwise I don't want
to  speculate what could have happened with Amelia.

We were at our Wit's End!!!!!! Thanks so much Jerry.
We have given your URL to everyone we know with a dog.

Your methods work. The others that we tried did not.

It is that simple!

Thank you, Thank you Thank you!

Not great!  I had been just closing off the upstairs bedroom
(a baby gate with the door fixed ajar about six inches keeps
the dogs out better than you'd expect), but the cats like to
hide in the wall of the linen closet (gotta love these old
houses!) when they're nervous and Crow and Eclipse tore
apart the linen closet to try to get to them.  That's when I
closed off the upstairs entirely.  They're also a bad
influence on Cinder, who started out thinking of the cats as
dinner but who had learned to live with them in peace until
her sisters arrived.  I think it's possible but, frankly,
improbable that they're eventually going to be safe with the
cats.

LeeCharlesKelley Wrote:

From what I've read of Jerry's method it incorporates
a completely new model of learning, which is based (in
simplest terms) on the idea that all behavior is the result
of finding a way to relieve emotional tension.
This is true not just for dogs but all animals.

You don't believe in the validity of this
particular model of learning?  You don't
think it makes sense?

Fine, I guess.

But it makes total sense to me.

And it made sense to Pavlov, too,
though not many people know this.

"Postitive emotions arising in connection
with the perfection of a skill, irrespective
of its pragmatic significance at a given
moment, serve as the reinforcement."
IOW, emotions, not outside rewards, are
what reinforces any behavior.

Finn once saw a small mouse come out of a hole
atthe base of a tree. Needless to say his prey
instinct kicked in BIG TIME and he chased it
back into the hole.  This was 7 years before
he died. Up until the very last time he walked
through that section of the park (an hour before
he went) he checked the base of that tree.

He saw that mouse exactly *once*....he never
saw it again. Don't we all have stories like
that?

Especially those of us with dogs whose
prey drives are pretty intense?

And there are lots of examples that may not
even require the prey drive to be active,
just a strong desire to do something: a dog
who wants to escape from the back yard will
learn how to do it once and never forget it,
a dog who wants to jump on the couch or the
bed doesn't need any repetitions to "reinforce"
or re-learn the behavior.

If something is important to a dog, he'll
learn how to do it.  Once he learns it, he
learns it.  The trick to getting him to
"unlearn" it, is to give him a more
emotionally satisfying replacement behavior.

With Oscar and the cat, the more satisfying
behavior was relating to me instead of the cat.
(He's a Lab, with a strong need for social
connections, so that was pretty easy.)

I've been experimenting recently with Jerry
Howe's method of using a sound distraction,
then praising the dog, without any physical
contact, for 15 seconds.

My initial reaction to his technique was that
it was silly to keep praising the dog that long.

I mean, Jerry's a nut, right?

But in every case except one, when I've followed
the exercise exactly, I've seen a definite
physiological change take place in the dog -
-yawning or stretching have been the usual
indicators -- and after only a few repetitions,

No, Nancy. You are just dead wrong on this one. Yes, there are
"hunting BREED purebreds" in shelters, mostly because stupid
people who have no intention of training them to be good citicens,
much less to hunt, buy poorly bred dogs from other ignoramuses and
then expect them to automatically behave, and when they don't, they
DO some of the abusive things you talk about, and when they still
don't, they abandon them.

IF those people had the benifit of some true knowledge about
how to PROPERLY train these poor dogs, they would not abandon
them so easily.

But to insinuste that a decent person would spend the mass
quantities of time and money it takes to train a hunting
companion, and then spend the years bonding in the blind,
and then dump him....

you really don't have a clue. I feel sorry for you on this count.

I grew up with a trained pointer that belonged to my older
brothers. When they both left for college, it was one of my
CHORES to take Robin out to point quail. I could kick them
up and then leave with her, or I could shoot at them, my
choice. But NO WAY was she going to atrophy in the back yard
just because her hunting buddies left home.
