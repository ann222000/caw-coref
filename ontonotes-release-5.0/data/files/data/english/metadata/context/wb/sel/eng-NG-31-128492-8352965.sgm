Out of the blue here in Florida I have a collection agency, AFNI in
Bloomington, IL, trying to collect almost $300 they claim I owe
Verizon from June 2001 for a phone number I had back then.  I have
been in the same house at the same address as on the old account since
1983 and cannot recall ever having service interrupted.  After a
divorce around that same time I changed my number.  Also, over the
last six year I never received a single bill or notice from Verizon
about this so called debt they are claiming.

The collection agency wrote to a PO Box I use and that past account
and my current account both are to my street address so I have no clue
as to how that happened.  When I disputed their claim they sent me
what looks like a copy of a bill from Jun 10, 2001, with a payment
shown and then they show the disputed amount at the bottom stating :

ADDITIONAL UNCOLLECTIBLE (WRITEOFF ACTIVITY)

I do not have my phone bill or payment records from back then but have
no bills or notices from Verizon regarding this bill.  When I
contacted Verizon to inquire about it all they told me was the account
for that number had been turned over to AFNI and to contact them.  I
asked why I had never been contacted and they just kept repeating to
contact AFNI.

In searching this out I found that Florida has a 4-year catch-all
limitations period, (F.S. 95.11(3)(p)) on general debts.  Since this
debt is six years old and there has never been any attempt made to
collect on it, do I need to put much into investigating the validity
of this?  I am a loyal and current Verizon customer for internet,
phone and wireless, and it's a little disheartening to get this
collection notice without any forewarning.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated,
Scott

You have two good options.  Plan A:
Write to the collection agency: &quot;Your firm has been contacting or attempting
to
contact me concerning an alleged debt.  Do not contact me about this matter
in any way.&quot;

Don't add any arguments, explanations, details or anything else.  Use
Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.  Put the Certified Mail Item
Number on the letter. (In order to do that you will have to get the form
from the Post Office in advance).  Keep a copy of the letter, the Return
Receipt and the mailing receipt in a safe place.

If the agency contacts you again in any way other than by filing suit
and serving the summons and complaint, take the letter to an attorney
experienced in handling cases under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
Make sure to select an attorney who will take the case on a contingency fee
basis.  Such an attorney won't be hard to find if you have some sort of
evidence that the recipient of the letter contacted you after they received
the certified letter.

Plan B:
Ignore the problem until the agency goes away.
