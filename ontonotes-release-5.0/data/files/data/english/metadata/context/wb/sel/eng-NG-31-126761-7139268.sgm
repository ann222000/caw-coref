Welcome to Talkback Topic - I'm Phillip Pye.

Death in custody is nothing new to the Aboriginal community. In
proportion to people of other races the rate is rather high. Some
sections of the community suspect that these deaths have being
caused,
either directly or indirectly, by the police and prison authorities,
though subsequent statistics have suggested that there is no
widespread culture of police brutality towards Aboriginal people.
Cameron Doomadgee, who died in the police watch-house on Palm Island,
70km north of Townsville on November 19, 2004, is the most recent
case
which has of late received somewhat controversial response.

This case is though by no means the first to implicate Police
involvement.
Eddie Murray was 21 when he was last arrested. On June 21 1981 he was
drinking under a tree with his cousin and some friends. He was
arrested at 1.45 am, taken to Wee Waa Police Station, and held under
the Intoxicated Persons Act. Within the hour he was dead, strangled
with a blanket in his cell. At the inquest the police claimed he had
killed himself by hanging, even though they agreed under cross
examination that he was "so drunk he couldn't scratch himself". Yet
according to the Police, Eddie had managed to tear a strip off a
thick
prison blanket, deftly fold it, thread it through the bars of the
window, tie two knots, fashion a noose, and hang himself without his
feet leaving the ground. Later the police were found to have lied
under oath. The coroner ruled that Eddie had died "at the hands of
person or persons unknown" and strongly criticised the police. No-one
was charged with Eddie's murder.

The Cameron Doomadgee case though has seen the Police Officer
involved
first relieved from prosecution by the Director of Public
Prosecutions
Leanne Clare but former New South Wales chief justice Sir Laurence
Street disagreed and Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley is now charged with
Manslaughter, a move that has angered the Queensland Police Union who
have resorted to threats of strike action. The fact is that Cameron
Doomandgee was a well loved and respected local who simply made an
error of judgement, he got drunk. What followed after his arrest
however resulted in a ruptured Liver, a ruptured spleen, and four
broken ribs, and finally, his death.

What is not well known is that The Palm Island Council has received
reports that this is not the first time the Police Sergeant involved
has had to be removed from a community because of a similar series of
incidents and the Council would like to know why he was re-assigned
to
another Aboriginal community without consideration. It is obvious
that
there are cases where some Policemen have taken the law into their
own
hands, an act they defy but hopefully this case will open up the
truth
and pave the way for it to not occur again and, with a little luck,
have cases such as that of the late Eddie Murray re-opened.
