Introductory notes.

This and the next sonnet are based on a poem in the Greek
Anthology attributed to Marcianus Scholasticus (5th cent.
AD). Shakespeare possibly saw an English translation
circulated by one of his friends. (KDJ suggests Ben Jonson).
The epigram describes how the sleeping Cupid is robbed of
his love-brand by the Nymphs, who seek to quench it by
plunging it in a fountain. The fountain heats up and the
brand is not quenched, so that the Nymphs thereafter bathe
in hot water. Shakespeare amplifies the poem by bringing in
the idea that the fountain becomes a medicinal cure, but he
finds that it cannot cure him from the pangs of love. The
only cure for that is to bathe in his mistress' eyes, the
very place where Cupid fired his brand initially.

Were it not for the other 152 sonnets, we would consider
these two final sonnets as fairly standard and belonging to
the derivative tradition of sonnet writing which had been
established and developed since the days of Petrarch
(1304-1374). It was quite common to take a snippet from
Greek mythology and work it into a poem. Compare for example
the following sonnet from Richard Linche's sonnets to Diella
(c.1596):

CUPID had done some heinous act or other,
that caused IDALEA whip him very sore.
The stubborn boy away runs from his mother,
protesting stoutly to return no more.
By chance, I met him; who desired relief,
and craved that I some lodging would him give.
Pitying his looks, which seemed drowned in grief,
I took him home; there thinking he should live.
But see the Boy! Envying at my life
(which never sorrow, never love had tasted),
He raised within my heart such uncouth strife,
that, with the same, my body now is wasted.
By thankless LOVE, thus vilely am I used!
By using kindness, I am thus abused. Diella 18.

Idalea = Venus.

Scores of similar sonnets were doubtless written in the
period. A courtier who felt himself obliged to woo a
recalcitrant dame of the court in the traditional manner,
yet doubted his own poetic talents, could easily find a
professional sonnet writer to compose one for him. There is
nothing particulary bad or inadequate about these two
closing sonnets. It is only because we have been accustomed
to seeing the poet's heart laid bare throughout the sequence
(or so we imagine it to be) that we are somewhat puzzled by
two far more traditional offerings. Possibly they were
written at a fairly early date, or, as has been suggested by
Hutton ** who researched the background of these sonnets
thoroughly, 154 was written first, and 153 was a second
version, adapted more to fit the themes of the closing
sonnets of the sequence to the dark lady. Whatever the
explanation, there is no reason for doubting that they are
genuinely Shakespearian, and their position here at the end
of the series is entirely fitting and appropriate to the
traditions of the period.

Line Notes.

1. 'Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:' [laid by =
put aside. With a suggestion also of 'laid down beside'.
his brand = his torch. Cupid sometimes was depicted carrying
a torch, with which he set lovers' hearts on fire. His more
usual attributes were a bow and a quiver full of arrows, but
in this case the poet is using the original idea in the poem
from the Greek Anthology.]

2. 'A maid of Dian's this advantage found,' [A maid of
Dian's - Diana was the goddess of the hunt, a virgin goddess
who was traditionally accompanied by many maidens. These
were also expected to be chaste. Being vowed to chastity
they would be keen on emasculating Cupid of his powers. They
hoped to do so by dipping his brand in the fountain.

this advantage found = stumbled upon this opportunity.]

3. 'And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep' [his
love-kindling fire = his brand, which set hearts aflame with
love (see line 1). Throughout the poem, and 154, there is a
hint that brand = penis, the ardour of which supposedly can
be cooled by immersion in a well or fountain (of pleasure or
coolness), the female vagina. (See the note to line 4). The
imagery then shifts slightly to include the possibility that
the hot fire is that of syphilis with which the lover
becomes infected, and possibly re-infects his beloved. The
hot fountain then suggests the sweating tubs or vats into
which the sufferer was immersed as a cure for the disease.
(Suffumigation with cinnabar in a meat pickling vat is a
remedy quoted by A.H.B. Doran in a chapter on medicine in
Shakespeare's England, Vol 1., Oxford 1916, p.493).

steep = plunge into, soak in.

4. 'In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;' [a cold
valley-fountain - see the note above.

For the sexual imagery compare the extract from Venus and
Adonis below, where Venus fondles Adonis in her arms:

'Fondling','she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
Within this limit is relief enough,
Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain. VA.229-238.

of this ground = in the vicinity, in that area.]

5. 'Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,' [which =
the fountain.
borrowed = acquired, assumed, derived the quality of. this
holy fire of Love = the brand of line 1, but also,
figuratively, the passion of love. Possibly a Spoonerish pun
on 'fiery hole' of love. The 'fountain' became hot with
love's power when the brand was plunged in it.]

6. 'A dateless lively heat, still to endure,' [dateless =
timeless, without end. lively = full of life, spirited,
vigorous. still to endure = which would last for ever.]

7. 'And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove' [grew =
became, transformed itself into. a seething bath = a
bubbling bath. The description suggests one of the medicinal
hot springs. which yet men prove = which even to this day
men find by experience is etc.]

8. 'Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.' [Against =
for, to combat.
strange maladies = exotic and inexplicable diseases, foreign
diseases.

Syphilis was known as the French malady, in the belief that
it came from France. Some authorities thought that it
originated from Italy.

sovereign = all powerful, supremely potent. OED.II.3. gives
examples of the word used in connection with remedies and
medicines, including 'Telling me, the Soueraign'st thing on
earth/ Was Parmacity, for an inward bruise. 1.H4.I.3.57.']

9. 'But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,' [my
mistress' eye - see the note to 148 line 9. Cupid often took
up residence in the beloved's eyes, face, breast, heart.
Here the conceit is that the brand is recharged at her eyes.
This and the remaining 5 lines link the sonnet to the dark
lady sequence, in that the poet talks of his mistress and
the experience of loving her, rather than expanding the
general conceit of the properties of Love's brand with which
the poem started.]

10. 'The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;' [The
boy = Cupid. for trial = to test it (the brand). needs
would = insists that he must. touch my breast - i.e. with
the brand.]

11. 'I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,' [sick
withal = ill as a result of this. the help of bath desired
= desired the help of the seething bath. The absence of a
definite article suggests that it is the bath mentioned in
line 7, as if he were saying 'I required the aid of the said
bath'. Some have suggested that the spa at Bath is intended,
which was known for its healing properties in Elizabethan
times.]

12. 'And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,' [thither =
to that place. hied = hastened, sped. sad = gloomy,
depressed. distempered = out of sorts, out of temper,
diseased. The word is usually applied to mental state, but
occasionally has a more bodily application. Compare:

Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
How foul it is; what rank diseases grow
And with what danger, near the heart of it.
WARWICK It is but as a body yet distempered;
Which to his former strength may be restored
With good advice and little medicine: 2H4.III.1.38-43.]

13. 'But found no cure, the bath for my help lies' [the
bath for my help = the only bath which would help me. lies
= is to be found, is situated.]

14. 'Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.' [Where
Cupid got new fire - The idea that Cupid recharged himself,
or discovered himself, in the body of the beloved, is common
among the sonnet writers. Sidney describes how Cupid hoped
to obtain fire from Stella:

At length he perched himself in Stella's joyful face,
Whose fair skin, beamy eyes, like morning sun on snow,
Deceived the quaking boy, who thought from so pure light
Effects of lively heat must needs in nature grow.
But she most fair, most cold, made him thence take his
flight
To my close heart, where while some firebrands he did lay,
He burnt un'wares his wings, and cannot fly away. A&amp;S.8

Samuel Daniel uses a similar idea to that used in this
sonnet in 'The Complaint of Rosamond'.
..................................O myracle of loue,
That kindles fire in water, heate in teares, Ros.394-5]

Edmund Spenser The Man on the Stair

Spenser's poem &quot;The Ruins of Time&quot; is concerned with a long lament
over the old city of Verulam, the site of St. Albans, where Francis
Bacon spent much of his time as a child. Around 1590 Bacon
wrote a letter to Fulke Greville. The letter was as follows:

&quot;Sir, I understand of your paines to have visited me; for which I
thank you. My matter is an endless Question. I assure you I had said:
Reqiesce anima mea: But now I am otherwise put to my psalter; Nolite
confideri. I dare go no farther. Her Majesty had by set speech, more
than once, assured me of her intention, to call me to her service; which
I could not understand, but of the place, I had been named to. And now,
whether Invidus Homo hoc fecit; or whether my Matter must be an Appendix
to my Lo: of Essex sute; or whether Her Majesty, pretending to prove my
Ability, meaneth but to take advantage of some Errours, which, like
enough, at one time or other I may commit; or what it is; but Her
Majesty is not ready to dispatch it. And what though the Mr. Of the
Rowles, and my Lo: of Essex, and yourself and others, think my case
without doubt; yet in the meantime I have a hard condition to stand so,
that whatsoever service I do to Her Majesty, it shall be thought to be
but servitium viscatum, time-twiggs, and Fetches, to place my self, and
I shall have Envy, not thanks. This is a course to QUENCH all good
spirits, and to corrupt EVERy Man's Nature: which will I fear, much
hurt, her Majesties Service in the end. I have been like a piece of
stuff bespoken in the Shopp: And if Her Majesty will not take me, it may
be the selling by parcels will be more gainful. For to be, as I told
you, like a Child following a Bird, which when he is nearest flyeth
away, and lighteth a little before, and then the Child after it again,
and so in Infinitum. I am weary of it:
As also of wearing my good friends: Of whom Nevertheless,
I hope in one course or other gratefully to deserve.&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The identity of the 8 poets who carried Spenser's coffin to
his burial in Westminster Abbey, is revealed by the historian,
who was an eye-witness of the ceremony. Camden, moreover,
declares that they are the most distinguished authors of his time,
and those whom future Sages will be compelled to admire:

&quot;Samuel Daniel, Hugh Holland, Ben Jonson, Tho. Campion, Mich
Drayton, George Chapman, John MArStON &amp; William Shakespeare.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;SAMuel DANIEL, John MArStON, &amp; James Shirley all fail
to mention books or MSS in their wills.&gt;&gt; - Park Honan

MA(r)S(t)ON died June 25, 1634
almost exactly 30 years after Oxford's 'death'.

BOTTLED BEERS, THE PREHISTORY

&lt;&lt;In Ben Jonson's play Bartholomew Fair (1631),

Ursula calls for &quot;A Bottle of Ale to QUENCH me, rascal&quot;.

Earlier, when the GLOBE Theatre burnt down there was a story
that the only casualty was a man whose breeches caught fire,
and that he was saved when a bottle of ale was
thrown over them extinguishing the flames.
