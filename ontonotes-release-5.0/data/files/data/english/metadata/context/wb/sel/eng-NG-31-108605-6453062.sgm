I'm trying to figure out how the General Dynamics yard at Quincy, Mass
converted the World War II era T-2 type oil tanker Mission San Fernando into
the missile tracking ship USNS Vanguard.

GD workers removed the bow and the stern, discarded the midships section,
and replaced it with a longer and wider midships section.  This happened in
1965.  I have good photos of the bow and stern disconnected, also of the
floatout of the completed ship, which was apparently preceded by the
floatout of the discarded midships section.

But I'm trying to figure out the sequence.

It does not seem to me that once the bow and stern were detached that they
could be moved (floated) at all, because they would be highly unstable.  But
I do have photos of at least the stern in a partially flooded drydock.  I
don't have any photos that show enough to determine how the pieces were
actually moved around, however.

Anybody have any ideas?  Remember, this was 1965.

And presumably the same applies to REDSTONE and MERCURY, also
converted in the same yard at the same time.

You may have these - but some VANGUARD photos are here:

Do the photos show the bow and stern disconnected from *each other*,
or disconnected from a *third* midships piece?  In other words, are
you certain the ship was cut in *two* places (three pieces), and the
middle thrown away? This is not the normal method of "jumboizing" a
ship, especially a tanker with a nice parallel midbody, a ship
perfectly suited to just cutting _once_ and sticking in a new section.
(dozens and dozens of tankers were done this way)

Most references simply say the ships had 75 or 80 feet added midships,
and there's no reason to throw away a couple hundred feet of good ship
just to do this.  All you've got to do is cut off the forward
superstructure (which just sits atop the oil tanks) and you've got a
nice clean deck.

I've also seen plenty of references that talk about the "bow" and
"stern" of a ship cut in two for jumboization, with what we would
normally think of as the "midships" section being included in the
"stern" part.

If your photos show *two* cuts, then it's settled....but still a bit
odd.

The photos on the cited website show the bow detatched, moved away
from the ship, with a launch-type cradle built up underneath it (much
more blocking than would be needed for a normal drydocking).  It
appears it's being skidded away on greased "ways" (like a conventional
sliding launch), presumably dragged by a big ole' winch.

The normal sequence would be like this...

1) Cut off bow
2) Cut off stern (if doing three pieces)
3) Move bow out of the way to a corner of the drydock (by dragging on
ways or rails or rollers)
4) Make bow non-bouyant by opening it to the sea (if non-floatable)
5) Flood dock
6) Remove midships section (if doing three pieces)
7) Float in new midships section
8) Drain dock
9) Move bow back into place

Notes:
A) The stern _probably_ would be heavy enough to remain on the blocks
while the dock was flooded so the lightweight, empty midships section
was floated in. Remember it's full of the only heavy stuff in the
entire ship, the machinery. If the ship was docked in the right
position to begin with, you wouldn't need to move the stern at all.

B) You could also scrap the midships section in place rather than
floating it away to be scrapped.

C) You could also assemble the midships section in place (although
this was not the case here)

Yeah, but I figure if I know how they did it for the first one, I know how
they did it for the other two.

I have those, plus a number of better pics.  I'd post them to navsource, but
the contact person for the missile range tracking ships section of navsource
is a dead link.

Yes.  I have a picture of the bow by its own in a dock, a picture of the
stern alone in a dock, and two pictures showing the midships removed.  In
one of the pics, the midships is being moved by tug across the bay (pond,
whatever).  In another picture the completed Vanguard hull is being pushed
by tugs and the old midships section is seen moored off in the distance.  It
is possible that the midships section being moved is actually from one of
the later ships.  Or it is possible that it was removed from the dock and
moored at one place, but then moved again shortly before the completed hull
was towed out of the dock.  Unfortunately, they printed the same exact
captions on all of the photos.

What I don't have are pics of the bow and stern actually being separated
from the midships section.

Polmar in Ships of the US Navy says that the ships were "increased in
length" by 76 feet.  But it is pretty clear that the midships section was
actually removed and discarded based both on the photos and on other info I
have.  I suspect several reasons for this.  For starters, instead of big
tanks in the middle, NASA wanted berthing and electronics spaces, and it
would seem to be difficult to install these in a preexisting hull.  Second,
they mounted large satellite dishes on the top deck and these required
substantial bracing running through the ship to the keel.  Probably easier
to build that from scratch than run it down through a big empty tanker
midsection.  (On the USNS Arnold and USNS Vandenberg, converted troopships,
they had to put in massive beams running all the way down to the keel.)

It's clear from the two photos--a short little stern piece and a short
little bow piece.

These were substantial conversions too.  If you look at the before and after
profiles, the bridge was amidships on the T-2 tankers, but it is at the
stern on the Vanguard.

The big problem is that the photos are confusing.  It is clear that the
midships was moved away in one big piece (bow and stern removed) and that
this happened shortly before the completed Vanguard hull was floated out.

If the dock was really wide I could see how this would be easy:

1-build the new midships on one side of the dock
2-float the tanker into the center section of the dock
3-cut off the bow and stern
4-reflood the dock, pull the old midships to one side and out of the dock
5-pull the new midships into the center of the dock, between the bow and
stern
6-connect the bow and stern to the new midships

But the photos are not consistent with this.  And I doubt that the dock was
three ships wide.

My suspicion is that what they did was this:

1-build the new midships in the dock
2-float it out of the dock and moor it
3-pull the T-2 tanker into the dock and cut off the bow and stern
4-pull the old midships out of the dock
5-push the new midships back into the dock
6-reconnect the bow and stern

My only question is how they moved the bow out of the way.  Did they
actually have to float it out of the dock too?  That seems unlikely.
