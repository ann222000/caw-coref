Last week, after a busy week at work, I finally got around
putting out two hummingbird feeders. The following morning, as I was
checking out my hummingbird garden to see if additional plants will be
needed this year, I heard that distinctive chattering behind me. When I
turned around, I saw two male rubythroats darting around in the limbs of
my Chinese Elm. Later, they continued their displays near my feeders and
the real fighting began. I'm guessing the quick response to my feeder
placement indicates that I waited a little long to put one out. Maybe
I'll be a little quicker on the ball next year.

As the birds were chattering about the Elm tree, I noticed a lot of
side-to-side movement, about a foot or so, followed by a short rest, and
then a similar display by the other bird. The hummers never really got
close to each other until one approached the feeder. The Elm is about 30
feet from the nearest feeder.

These were not the first birds that I saw. The day before, I was walking
around downtown Alexandria when a person with whom I was walking
shouted, "Don't step on the hummingbird!" I almost had. We stopped and
saw a male on the sidewalk just sitting there. I assumed that it was
stunned and tried to coax it onto my finger so I could put it on a
nearby limb and out of the way of other pedestrians. When my finger
touched its breast, it immediately flew up to the nearest tree and found
a perch.

I'll try to get some photos of the hummers at my feeder this weekend. I
expect the Cross Vine to be in bloom by Sunday so maybe I can get some
shots of hummers feeding at those blooms. For now, I have moved last
year's better hummer photos to:

Eric -- thanks for this post. I am really looking forward to this year's
addition of your hummer prints -- did you get a new camera?  I love all
of your pics but #4051 really stands out for me this time.  What I can't
understand is that you didn't include the one you took of the hummer in
a dive #4052 -- that one is fantastic and one I hope to add to my
collection once I see some of your new prints.

Happy Spring,
Pat

Thanks Pat,

#4052 must simply have been in another directory when I switched to the new
gallery script. My personal favorites change over time and when I shuffle
through the pictures to change my gallery, sometimes I omit and add without
rhyme or reason.

That image can still be seen at:

http://www.dyesscreek.com/hummingbirds/my_best/index.htm

Even that gallery needs to be updated though. I also included #4052 in the
slideshow at:

http://www.dyesscreek.com/hphoto

That page is a work in progress to replace the front page of my hummingbird
photography section.

When I can find the time to do some photography, I usually run out of time
to do appropriate web updates. One unfinished project was to experiment on
the best angles to illuminate and photograph the gorget of a rubythroat. I
have all the images, I just haven't had time to make the page.

Eric, your hummingbird photos are simply phenomenal.  I certainly agree with
Pat's choice of a favourite but I think mine has to be #0637.  To me, that
is just the perfect hummingbird photo.  You've really outdone yourself with
that one.

AHA -- I framed this one and have it hanging on my office wall.  Very
well liked among my office visitors.

The "high res" version makes a pretty good desktop background at 1024 x 768.
I'm thinking about making an appropriate crop to give away for that purpose.
Anyone is welcome to use it for that purpose.

What I really liked about this shot was the variation in the color of the
gorget feathers. This is the first bird that I have photographed with that
amount of variation. I was watching a feeder closely two days ago and
noticed a male that had some color variation in his gorget feathers (I was
about three feet away). I wonder whether this is a feature of only the older
males or whether this is common even in younger ones. Maybe Lanny knows, if
he is listening . . .
