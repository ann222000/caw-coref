Just arranged a car rental, cost $223 plus these incidental charges
for a total of $302 -

30.00  customer facility charge
24.71  concession recovery fee
15.77  gvt service fee
14.00  tax recoupment
9.53  license recovery surcharge
4.76  county car rental fee

Seems like things are getting outta hand.  Is this like the phony fees
on telephone company invoices?

You didn't say where you rented that car and if the drop off is that
same as the pick up place. You might call the rental agency to discuss
those fees, particularly the first two. It is not unusual for local
governments to pile taxes onto rental car agencies to help pay for large
capital projects such as building a stadium, airport, etc, but that
doesn't explain those first two charges.

Nope. It's politicians and citizens who think taxing non-residents is a painless
way of raising revenue. Started with sports arenas about a decade ago and has
grown to the point of absurdity.

The problem is, there doesn't appear to be any way to stop it. Local pols calim
that the taxes only affect visitors. Of course, almost every location is doing
it, so everybody gets clipped.

What pisses me off about car rental places is that they always ask you if
you want "STANDARD" insurance coverage or something else (forget what they
call it, and it varies by company anyway).  The catch is, YOU NEED
NEITHER!!!  They don't offer you the option to decline it, you have to know
to STATE that you are declining ALL insurance coverage, or you will get
ripped off.

It's annoying to have to fight NOT to get ripped off each and every time you
pick up a G-D rental car.

For the few consumers who still are not aware of this, just about all major
credit cards (a major *credit*, not debit card is REQUIRED to rent a car,
btw) have insurance (comes standard with the credit card account) that FULLY
covers rental cars.  Many employers ALSO have insurance poicies that FULLY
cover rental cars.  Many PRIVATE auto insurance policies ALSO FULLY cover
rental cars.

In other words, most consumers are double or TRIPLE-covered, as far as
insurance coverage for the rental car goes, before they even make the car
rental reservation!  So if you buy any insurance coverage at all from a
rental car company, it is 100% pure profit for the rental car company.  On
the off chance that you "total" the rental car, it is likely that the rental
car company's insurance will claim that you are covered under another policy
anyway (and they are RIGHT on that!), so it will never pay a penny, even IF
you file a claim against it.    -Dave

If pressed, the company can show you that those fees
do cover actual expenses incurred by the company for
such things as using space at the airport and local taxes.
Better to squeeze hapless travellers than local citizenry.
Rental companies like to quote you al fee of $10.00,
use that to add up the fees, and then bill you $100.00.

Well, you know whenever a city wants more money
they'll levy a new tax, increase an old tax, or float a
bond program. And, of course, the residents are
always told the car rental outfits and hotel visitors
will be paying the tab.

I guess this is an example.

But, I think I'd write to the rental agency, requesting
a detailed explanation. and, of course, reimbursement
for all charges not fully authorized.

Not quite.  It would be like:

Fuel surcharge $0.39

That model won't work for them because, when you ask for the price of
renting the car, it would have to be the TOTAL instead of just one
portion of the cost.  Rent a 39.99/per day car for a day, and it might
cost 199.99 by the time they are done.
And the insurance is usually a ripoff.

At first glance, maybe "30.00  customer facility charge" relates
to a rental agency delivering the car to some location that
wasn't their own headquarters(?)  Like if they drop off the
rental car at a body shop, where you have just handed over your
own car.  Some insurance policies apparently have combined
claims, where they provide a rental while your own car is being
repaired after an accident.

And, "24.71  concession recovery fee" sounds like maybe the car
was returned to some location (the body shop?  or another branch
of the rental chain?) and then "recovered" (driven back) to the
original rental location(?)

No, I would automatically expect that the offered option would
place another line-item on the bill.

"Would you like curly fries?"  would sound similar to, "Would you
like fries?" - PLUS - in the sense that it adds to the offering -
and expense.  And, when grabbing fast food, I wouldn't be in a
mood to quibble over 25 cents.  I would usually want to get in,
and get out, soon, and that would be the priority.

Please don't tell me that you intellectually contemplate the
quality of (gack!) McDonald's coffee (gulp, gack...)  The brand
of coffee that they serve in HELL, to the poor condemned souls,
finding the only drive-through, or breakfast place open... Can we
please pay a thousand years of labour to get a huge white-bread
muffin with a tiny crumb of bacon, and a little sliver of
reconstituted fried egg?

On the other hand... I usually get my monthly junk food from one
place.  And their only questions are, which variety of salt I
want on my chips, and if I am going to eat in or take-away (they
know I usually eat there.)

And it isn't McDonald's - but, rather a Greek fish-n-chips, with
a selection of gourmet burgers - I love them all.

If I want a little tub of tomato sauce, or tartre sauce, I just
pull one from the basket, and tell them.  Drinks are pre-packaged
bottles from a fridge, and you can just get one and present it.

At kebab joints in the city, there is a basic price for each
type.  "I'll take the vegetarian combo, please."  And there, the
options are just whether you want onions, and what kind of sauce.
Which don't effect the price.  They don't ask if I want any side
stuff.  I would have to ask.

McDonald's?  Burger King?  Eeeeewwwww... I'd only do that if some
lunch-mate wanted to go.  KiwiBurgers at McD are actually semi-OK
- beetroot over the patty is cool - I dunno if they exist in
other countries.  Otherwise, nooooo...

IMHO, you're building complexity where none exists.
"Customer  facility charge" is likely intended to defray their
cost of maintaining their rental facility, such as rent+utlities.
The "concession recovery fee" recoups the fee they pay to
the port authority for operating on-site at the airport, their
counter-space in the baggage area, and/or shuttle-buses.
All this insures that no matter how low the car rent, they
won't lose money.  =R=

Alice,

Unfortunately, many municipalities have decided to add all sorts of tariffs to
auto rental (at least in the US) to pay for all sorts of "improvements," like
sports stadia for professional sports teams, that threaten to leave the
cities, unless they ante up billions of $. The feeling is that the tourists
will always come, and they might as well bilk them of the $.

I do not know where you rented, but one will find all sorts of similar charges
for hotel rooms, auto rental, on-site dining at resorts and even some "retail"
outlets at resorts. Airline tickets from certain locations can also hold this
sort of "extra" charges.

Some day, the tourist trade might well dry up in some of these areas and then
the cities, counties, etc. will be left with no recourse, but to increase
taxes.

No, the facility charge and concession fee are usually related to a rental
agency that is located on airport property.  They have to rent the space in
the airport AND pay a fee to run a concession in the airport, so the costs
are passed along to people who rent cars at the airport.  I don't agree with
it.  -Dave

That's the same for everything in all the other shops as well.
I might pay more if I buy something at the airport instead of any
other shopping mall without a runway outside the back door,
but the price is neatly written on the shelf, and I don't get a

Usually, sales tax is tacked on (unlike the "VAT included" price)
The more reputable rental agencies will quote a "taxes included"
or detail them in a reservation offer, instead of low-balling you
with fine print. Caveat emptor anytime you see an absurdly low
rate compared to others.  "If its too goo to be true, it usually is."

Of course I do ;-) But only when I book a car abroad. My local
rental agency has no extra charges whatsoever, have my data in their
computer, and I only swipe my 'CarExpress' card through the reader
at the self-service terminal to get the car key and documents. Life
can be so easy...

Last year I rented a car from FOX in LA.  We contracted for a "compact
car". When we got there they asked if we wanted to upgrade to a full
size car and said it would be much better for our trip.  I declined and
they then handed us the keys.  When we got to the car in the parking lot
it WAS a full sized as they had run out of compacts.  So they would have
charged us the extra if we had said, "yes".  Nice, eh?

Similar thing happened to me in central SF. I waited over an hour in the
line for my compact vehicle, which I'd booked months ahead, to be told
all they had was a minivan. They were inundated with customers walking
off the street and were transporting vehicles from SFO to cope with
demand. If I still wanted my original booking I'd have to wait at least
another hour.

I took the van - for the original cost of the compact. It was more like

&gt; What pisses me off about car rental places is that they always ask you if

&gt; know to STATE that you are declining ALL insurance coverage, or you will
&gt; get ripped off.

&gt; It's annoying to have to fight NOT to get ripped off each and every time
&gt; you pick up a G-D rental car.

&gt; For the few consumers who still are not aware of this, just about all
&gt; major credit cards (a major *credit*, not debit card is REQUIRED to rent a
&gt; car, btw) have insurance (comes standard with the credit card account)
&gt; that FULLY covers rental cars.  Many employers ALSO have insurance poicies

This of course does NOT apply to foreign visitors to the USA who are NOT
covered by their private insurance and who damm well better take out
insurance.

&gt;&gt; I took the van - for the original cost of the compact. It was more like

&gt;Did you ever calculate how much more you spent on fuel than you would
&gt;have had you driven the compact instead?

No, but since gas in the US then was much cheaper than I'm used to
paying in the UK, that wasn't too important. I think I may have had to
fill the tank once during the week.

I also didn't like the idea of waiting a further hour - which was just
an estimate. We'd already checked out of our lodging and needed to get
on the road.

What most worried me was getting the thing out of the car park - the
hand brake was on the dash or somewhere. It took me 20 minutes going
through the manual before I got it in motion. Then I managed to navigate
back to the lodging through some of SF's steepest streets. Luckily for
me they were quiet at the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's always fun to find out you just doubled your rental rate because

&gt;&gt;Yup, I've seen that.  You were on a weekly rate, but now you are suddenly
&gt;&gt;switched to a daily rate, and the total cost is twice as much as the
&gt;&gt;weekly
&gt;&gt;rate would have been . . .

&gt; And somehow they can't understand why a customer might be upset at
&gt; this.

A weekly rate (that's less than 7*daily rate) is a form of a volume
discount. Nothing unusual about that. You get a lower per-day rate in
exchange for guaranteeing that for the next week, the car will have no
non-revenue-generating days.

If rental companies let you off with a prorated weekly charge for returning
the car early, they'd soon have no daily renters. Everyone would just claim
they want to rent the car for weeks, then "oops! - our plans changed and we
have to return it after one day."

AFAIK, these renters are not ooking for a pro-rated weekly rate,
but to pay as if they'd kept the car for a week.  Example: I rented
a car for a week in Nashville for ~$200, concluded my business
early and returned it in five days, resulting in a charge of $250.
A triffle, perhaps, but if I'd known someone in Nashville to return
the car for me two days later, then they and not the rental agency
would have had free use of the car for two days, and I'd have
saved $50.  [Excluding the extra driver fee.]  Its silly.  =R=

Exactly.  It's happened to me a few times.  Dispatched to middle-of-nowhere,
given 7 days to finish work, finish in 5, return rental car and get hit with
a $150 penalty (over and above what WOULD have been the weekly rate) for
returning the car early.  Once, the rental car lot I was returning the car
to had RUN OUT OF CARS and was desperate for more cars to rent.  In other
words, they wanted to charge my company an extra ~150 bucks, just to turn
around and rent the car to someone else that same day, WHILE I WAS STILL
PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED TO BE RENTING THAT SAME CAR!!!  -Dave
