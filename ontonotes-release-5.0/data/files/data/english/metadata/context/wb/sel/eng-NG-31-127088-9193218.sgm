I realize that this may be a topic for another group being that this
is about a common law relationship but I thought here would be a good
place to start.

I'm 41 and have been with my fiance for almost 5 years. He and I were
highschool sweethearts and we both went on to marry others only to
have both marriages tank at roughly the same time.

I was adamant that I would not consider dating until after his wife
had agreed to separate and eventually divorce, and move out of the
&quot;marital&quot; home. She did in late 2001, and in early 2002 we started
dating again. In December 2002 I moved in with him.

We discussed marriage, and we agreed that it was a bit of a sore topic
for both of us, especially him. I did not bring it up again until he
proposed in March of 2004. We bought my engagement ring and wedding
ring in July of the same year, and had hoped to marry in April of
2005. We even bought gifts for the best man and maid of honour.

As he is self employed, and cash flow being erratic, it did not
happen. Nor did it happen later. The marriage license application, the
final page of both our divorce decrees (originals as the application
must be accompanied with the document showing the court seal), and a
copy of my birth certificate have all disappeared.

For the most part our relationship has been steady sailing, with few
arguments. However, he blew up on Sunday because of a number of things
he had chosen not to discuss with me prior. The trigger was that he
wanted to go out, but neglected to tell me he wanted to ride our
motorcycles. This being especially important because of his 8 1/2 year
old son, whose riding gear was not in our home, but at his mother's. I
offered to let the boy use my helmet, and being the typical mom (I
have a 15 year old son of my own who was at a friend's), I volunteered
to stay home so the child could go out with his dad.

I have now come to the irrfutable conclusion that, after nearly 5
years together, numerous postponements of a wedding, no further
discussion of setting a date to even go to city hall, and no other
legal assurances (ie a will) in my favour that he has never had any
intention of marrying. With no will and no legal marriage, should
anything happen to him I am in legal limbo. Our rented house is owned
by his sister, and all I have is the clothes on my back and no
furniture.

I am despondent. I want to scream at him that despite that he says he
wants me enough to live with him, to sleep with him and care for him,
his son and his home, he does not want me enough to marry me. He has
always found a way to pay the bills and to get the nifty accessories
for his motorcycle (fairing, trunk, CB radio). It tears me apart to
realize that he just doesn't care enough to make things happen for a
wedding. Even a small one in our home, with an officiant attending at
the house than a big affair in our church. If he cared half as much
for me, and wanted me half as much as his toys, he'd have made it
legal long ago.

I can't even stand to look at him any more.

It's odd to me that in the next to last paragraph, you say you want to marry
him, then you say you can't stand to look at him.  I think you're very upset
and are connecting too much of your upset to the marriage issue.

If I were he, I'd have no idea it was so important to you - the marriage
part.  The legal part is something that middle aged people start thinking
about
(death and property, etc.) but he may not be thinking about it as much as
you
are.  You are close to sounding morbid about your reasons for wanting to get
married.

Maybe back up a little?  You started out sounding like the two of you
really care about each other.  If you're paying more than your share of the
bills (he doesn't pay for his own motorcycle goodies?) that's a separate
issue,
and wouldn't be resolved by getting married or not, I don't think.

If you just started disliking him this weekend, I'd wait till my mood had
settled
down and start planning a simple wedding.  Any reason he wouldn't go along
with it?

Out of curiosity,  why did his cash flow and employment status

Perhaps.  Or perhaps it simply isn't important to him.  Have you made

Do you have a job?  It sounds like niether of you have a lot of

Don't scream at him.  Tell him, if this is the way you feel, that
_not_ being married is a dealbreaker for you.  In other words, unless
he wants to get married, you want to move on to find someone who is
interested in making a permanent committment.

But only tell him this if it really _is_ how you feel!

I wonder if you are understanding the situation correctly.  How do you
know that _he_ knows he needs to marry you in order to have you?
After all, you've had a good (mutually good, you say) 5 years without
marriage.  How does he know that it is important to change this
situation.

&gt; One of the few things that I've really learned is that you can't look
&gt; at someone else's behavior and judge it the same way that you would
&gt; your own... that is, if it were up to *you*, you would make this
&gt; happen before buying the motorcycle stuff, because that would be a
&gt; sign to you that the relationship is important, etc.  He might have
&gt; totally different reasons... and in fact, one of them might be, it
&gt; just doesn't occur to him that this is important.  Or how important it
&gt; is to you.  That doesn't mean necessarily that he doesn't love you or
&gt; value the relationship, but that he doesn't see this one thing as the
&gt; big thing.

&gt; But in a healthy relationship, partners have to understand what the
&gt; other person needs.  And you need for this wedding to happen, for a
&gt; collection of reasons, both practical and because it is important to
&gt; you.  And it seems that the possibilities are, he knows that but
&gt; doesn't really care, or that he doesn't know that... or doesn't
&gt; *understand* it.

&gt; What would happen if you said, I want to get married now, even if it
&gt; is just going down to city hall, and this is more important to me than
&gt; anything else?
">

He *knows* how important this is to me. From an emotional and legal
standpoint. We *still* say we should have gotten married when we were
21 instead of letting our parents run our lives.

I've told him I want to be married. But he wants to have a party,
friends over etc. because my first wedding *was* at city hall. I don't
want to do it up like he did for his first. It put them $12K in debt
in 1992. I feel now like it was, and still is, an empty promise.

Besides, we can't do *anything* about it until my BC and those divorce
decrees are found. And I'm *not* paying $200 to get copies because he
lost them either. He can find the money if he wants to get duplicates
from the court. But, alas, he hasn't even tried to find the originals
yet, so that is a nonissue.

I *thought* we really cared about each other. After he blew up about

said we just simply wouldn't have sex. BUT he doesn't want me moving
into the spare room. EH?!! He wants me in the same room, same bed, but
no sex because he doesn't want a baby? What kind of logic is that? The
logic of a man who doesn't know what he wants. He wants to keep

Yeah. No money to do it his way. I've suggested we grab his nephew
(who's 25 and was to be his best man) and my sister (who's 29), our 2
kids and just go to Niagara Falls in the spring and do it there. Nope.
Not good enough.

I give up. I'm not going to plan it and just tell him when and where
to be. It seemed to matter more in 2004 than now.

&gt; gifts. I feel like it was an empty promise and a waste of money. And I
&gt; feel like I've been lied to.

&gt;&gt; If I were he, I'd have no idea it was so important to you - the marriage
&gt;&gt; part.  The legal part is something that middle aged people start thinking
&gt;&gt; about (death and property, etc.) but he may not be thinking about it as
&gt;&gt; much as
&gt;&gt; you are.  You are close to sounding morbid about your reasons for wanting
&gt;&gt; to get
&gt;&gt; married.

&gt; I *am* middle aged. I'm 41. We even talked about having a baby
&gt; together. Now I'm too freaking old. That boat sailed almost 4 years
&gt; ago.
">

That was my point.  You weren't as worried about it years ago as you are
now -
and you're likely to get more, rather than less, anxious about it as you get
older.
I'm far older than you, btw.

But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater!

&gt; I *thought* we really cared about each other. After he blew up about

&gt; didn't say &quot;ever&quot;. But I did tell him I would make sure it wouldn't

&gt; no sex because he doesn't want a baby? What kind of logic is that? The

You guys had a major fight.  It was all over the place (weddings, babies,
motorcycles, paperwork, tubes, etc., etc).  You said in your first post that
you hardly ever fight.  Could it be the case that both of you, in your first
marriages, were the kind who held things in?  Kind of saved it all up and
then went kablooey?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If you just started disliking him this weekend, I'd wait till my mood had

&gt;&gt; A.

&gt; Yeah. No money to do it his way. I've suggested we grab his nephew
&gt; (who's 25 and was to be his best man) and my sister (who's 29), our 2
&gt; kids and just go to Niagara Falls in the spring and do it there. Nope.
&gt; Not good enough.

Focus on this one issue - and yes, you do have a problem.  If he really
thinks it's more important to do it his way than to be married, focus on
that problem.

Sounds good to me - and solves *your* side of the dilemma.  Let him
get his act together for the party.

Sounds like he shouldn't have been the one trusted to obtain and hold
on to the paperwork (in my relationship, I'm the one who cannot be trusted
to do that - he has to do that, fortunately, I can ask him to hold on to
things
whether he sees the need or not, and he will - maybe you're evolving into
the more responsible person, in that department).

Let me ask you, though, if you have time.  if you're the one who is more
responsible in general?  If that's bugging you, it's okay to be bugged by
it -
but it doesn't necessarily make him a bad person (just less responsible than
you - one of you is likely to be more or less in many ways than the other).

Hang in there.

No money means no license, no officiant. There were times when we had

&gt; &gt; For the most part our relationship has been steady sailing, with few
&gt; &gt; arguments. However, he blew up on Sunday because of a number of things
&gt; &gt; he had chosen not to discuss with me prior. The trigger was that he
&gt; &gt; wanted to go out, but neglected to tell me he wanted to ride our
&gt; &gt; motorcycles. This being especially important because of his 8 1/2 year
&gt; &gt; old son, whose riding gear was not in our home, but at his mother's. I
&gt; &gt; offered to let the boy use my helmet, and being the typical mom (I
&gt; &gt; have a 15 year old son of my own who was at a friend's), I volunteered
&gt; &gt; to stay home so the child could go out with his dad.

&gt; Another question I guess - why is this tantrum of his on Sunday an
&gt; important part of the story.
">

This was when he told me he didn't want a baby together and proceeded
to tell me that he thinks that I haven't a clue. He said he wanted to
spend time with me. Fine. When he suggested we go out, in 11 celcius
weather, he did not tell me it was on 2 wheels. He didn't think to
make sure his son had his bike gear. He didn't like it when I
suggested 1) I go to his ex's (about 1 mile away) and get the gear, or
2) borrow his pal's XS helmet and the pal wear another helmet, or 3)
that I take the minivan.

I started thinking about babies and marriage and everything. I finally
put the stalling together. If he's willing to drop $2500 on his bike
for a fairing, and spend over 30 hours wiring it, why can't he spend
$200 bucks and 2 hours to get married? After regretting marrying
someone else for 11 years, then finally having the ability to get
married, to keep stalling? I think he never meant it in the end.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I have now come to the irrfutable conclusion that, after nearly 5
&gt; &gt; years together, numerous postponements of a wedding, no further
&gt; &gt; discussion of setting a date to even go to city hall, and no other
&gt; &gt; legal assurances (ie a will) in my favour that he has never had any
&gt; &gt; intention of marrying.

&gt; Perhaps.  Or perhaps it simply isn't important to him.  Have you made
&gt; it clear to him how important it is to you?
">

We have talked about it. When we did, I made sure I told him it was
important to me. I thought it meant the same to him. I've tried to
plan one, but we've had to postpone because the big job that was
supposed to net us $4000 never happened. Now, some schmuck owes us $10
grand that was supposed to pay for a wedding and a new roof. We won't
see that money and we can't afford to sue because they are owned by an
out-of-province megacorporation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; With no will and no legal marriage, should
&gt; &gt; anything happen to him I am in legal limbo. Our rented house is owned
&gt; &gt; by his sister, and all I have is the clothes on my back and no
&gt; &gt; furniture.

&gt; Do you have a job?  It sounds like niether of you have a lot of
&gt; property, right?  So it isn't clear that marrying him will add a lot
&gt; to your financial security.
">

We are both self employed. We run a partnership business together.
Money is sporadic. I'm not looking for financial security. Just
emotional security. And he just ripped the carpet out from under me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I am despondent. I want to scream at him that despite that he says he
&gt; &gt; wants me enough to live with him, to sleep with him and care for him,
&gt; &gt; his son and his home, he does not want me enough to marry me.

&gt; Don't scream at him.  Tell him, if this is the way you feel, that
&gt; _not_ being married is a dealbreaker for you.  In other words, unless
&gt; he wants to get married, you want to move on to find someone who is
&gt; interested in making a permanent committment.

&gt; But only tell him this if it really _is_ how you feel!
">

It is. Problem is there is no savings for me to leave. And I sold most
of my furniture in 2002 to move into his already furnished home with
him. And while there is moving out, there is no moving on. I can't
start over again from this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wonder if you are understanding the situation correctly.  How do you
&gt; know that _he_ knows he needs to marry you in order to have you?
&gt; After all, you've had a good (mutually good, you say) 5 years without
&gt; marriage.  How does he know that it is important to change this
&gt; situation.
">

The lack of marriage was a nonissue while we were both smarting from
horribly failed marriages. Both our exes had affairs and denied them.
We agreed not to say the M word until he was ready. Then he proposed.
He has *always* known what it means to me.

I'd like to talk with him, but I haven't calmed down yet.

I won't wait for him to get his act together. I've told him that I
won't wait around for him till I need a walker to go down the aisle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sounds like he shouldn't have been the one trusted to obtain and hold

&gt; things whether he sees the need or not, and he will - maybe you're evolving into
&gt; the more responsible person, in that department).

I was holding on to them. I had them on my dresser waiting to go. All
was signed. All I needed was an hour and his ID or presence. Then the
papers walked. When I asked if he saw them he said he did and he was
going to get the license and surprise me. SURPRISE! The papers are now
lost.

&gt; I only realized the whole married thing last night. I couldn't sleep,
&gt; and didn't sleep well. I dreamed about finally saving money to get
&gt; married and he went and spent it on a new paint job for the bike
&gt; without telling me, after knowing it was for a wedding....

&gt; I'd like to talk with him, but I haven't calmed down yet.

Then there's your reason for posting here.  It does help.

Guys just don't think about weddings as much as they think about bikes.
(I'll probably be scolded by someone somewhere for gender stereotyping,
I'm just saying it's the same way over here, where I live - opposite coast,
I'm sure there are some wedding-happy guys somewhere).

There's also human nature.  I was really excited about getting married
15 years ago, then it passed and it passed for him, too.  We ended up with
the most simple civil ceremony imaginable, no guests, nothing.  I know lots
of people who have married that way (including my parents) so it was no
big deal - don't regret it now, at all.

But, occasionally (and at your age) I might have felt quite wounded by
neglect of wedding and the fact that the bike is prospering.

Try not to make him feel bad about the bike - it's water under the bridge.
Perhaps you should figure out better ways of managing money, more
generally?  If the money is in an account that doesn't have an ATM or
checking
account attached to it, that helps.

You might want to think real hard about that, then.  I spent a lot of years
in a marriage where he spent all the income on things he wanted, to the
point where I wasn't able to get the things that I wanted or needed.  There
was a very unfair power imbalance in our money  management, because he spent
it on his own hobbies and interests before I had a chance to even think
about budgeting for household things, etc.  This is not a great way to live,
and you might want to give some thought as to whether you would be signing
on for something like that - and if so, why you'd want to.

&gt;I realize that this may be a topic for another group being that this
&gt; is about a common law relationship but I thought here would be a
&gt; good
&gt; place to start.

&gt; I'm 41 and have been with my fiance for almost 5 years. He and I
&gt; were
&gt; highschool sweethearts and we both went on to marry others only to
&gt; have both marriages tank at roughly the same time.

&gt; I was adamant that I would not consider dating until after his wife
&gt; had agreed to separate and eventually divorce, and move out of the
&gt; &quot;marital&quot; home. She did in late 2001, and in early 2002 we started

&gt; We discussed marriage, and we agreed that it was a bit of a sore
&gt; topic
&gt; for both of us, especially him. I did not bring it up again until he
&gt; proposed in March of 2004. We bought my engagement ring and wedding
&gt; ring in July of the same year, and had hoped to marry in April of
&gt; 2005. We even bought gifts for the best man and maid of honour.

&gt; As he is self employed, and cash flow being erratic, it did not

&gt; the
&gt; final page of both our divorce decrees (originals as the application
&gt; must be accompanied with the document showing the court seal), and a
&gt; copy of my birth certificate have all disappeared.

&gt; For the most part our relationship has been steady sailing, with few
&gt; arguments. However, he blew up on Sunday because of a number of
&gt; things
&gt; he had chosen not to discuss with me prior. The trigger was that he
&gt; wanted to go out, but neglected to tell me he wanted to ride our
&gt; motorcycles. This being especially important because of his 8 1/2
&gt; year
&gt; old son, whose riding gear was not in our home, but at his mother's.
&gt; I
&gt; offered to let the boy use my helmet, and being the typical mom (I
&gt; have a 15 year old son of my own who was at a friend's), I
&gt; volunteered
&gt; to stay home so the child could go out with his dad.

&gt; I have now come to the irrfutable conclusion that, after nearly 5
&gt; years together, numerous postponements of a wedding, no further
&gt; discussion of setting a date to even go to city hall, and no other
&gt; legal assurances (ie a will) in my favour that he has never had any
&gt; intention of marrying. With no will and no legal marriage, should
&gt; anything happen to him I am in legal limbo. Our rented house is
&gt; owned
&gt; by his sister, and all I have is the clothes on my back and no
&gt; furniture.

&gt; I am despondent. I want to scream at him that despite that he says
&gt; he
&gt; wants me enough to live with him, to sleep with him and care for
&gt; him,
&gt; his son and his home, he does not want me enough to marry me. He has
&gt; always found a way to pay the bills and to get the nifty accessories
&gt; for his motorcycle (fairing, trunk, CB radio). It tears me apart to
&gt; realize that he just doesn't care enough to make things happen for a
&gt; wedding. Even a small one in our home, with an officiant attending
&gt; at
&gt; the house than a big affair in our church. If he cared half as much
&gt; for me, and wanted me half as much as his toys, he'd have made it
&gt; legal long ago.

&gt; I can't even stand to look at him any more.
">

Lot's of issues here.  First of all, you've got to bring order to this
situation.  It's foreign for some people to think that a financial
negotiation actually has to take place in situations like this, but
they do.  And it goes well beyond a will, although that's a piece of
the picture.

What you've got to do for the financial aspects of this is to approach
it like a business partnership in many ways.  Sit down by yourself or
with someone who's financial acumen you trust, and lay out a proposed
partnership arrangement that you think would work.  Whether it's
through combining your finances, or separating them, or an agreement
as to who owns what, and who gets what in the case of infirmity or
death, or any other issues that come up, you've got to spell it all
out.

You've also got to figure out why you're in a situation where, if he
goes, all you've got are the clothes on your back?  Is he in any
better situation?  If so, is it because he earns more than you, or
because of some other factors?  IOW, if you had never hooked up with
this guy, would you be any better off on your own and single?  If not,
then I'm not sure blaming him for the fact that this is the way it
would be if he left is fair to him unless there's an agreement between
you that you should stay home, or work part time, or otherwise inhibit
your revenue generating capabilities for the relationship, and if
that's the case, then don't do that anymore.

However, if you'd be capable of fully supporting yourself on your own,
then why are you bothered?

Anyway, once you've got the finances straightened out, then you've got
to bring order to the rest of the relationship, but again, you've got
to realize that you cannot hold him responsible for your decisions.
If you choose to stay with *him*, then realize that person he is, and
don't hold him responsible for not being who you want him to be.  Take
him for who *he* is, warts and all, or don't take him at all.

There are two other people living in the house - her 15 year old son,
and his 8 year old son. The two moved in together awfully quickly. It
wouldn't be such a wild supposition that one or the other of the kids
hid the documents - because they don't want their parent to remarry.

&gt; (I'll probably be scolded by someone somewhere for gender
&gt; stereotyping,
&gt; I'm just saying it's the same way over here, where I live - opposite
&gt; coast,
&gt; I'm sure there are some wedding-happy guys somewhere).

&gt; There's also human nature.  I was really excited about getting
&gt; married
&gt; 15 years ago, then it passed and it passed for him, too.  We ended
&gt; up with
&gt; the most simple civil ceremony imaginable, no guests, nothing.  I
&gt; know lots
&gt; of people who have married that way (including my parents) so it was
&gt; no
&gt; big deal - don't regret it now, at all.

&gt; But, occasionally (and at your age) I might have felt quite wounded
&gt; by
&gt; neglect of wedding and the fact that the bike is prospering.

&gt; Try not to make him feel bad about the bike - it's water under the
&gt; bridge.
&gt; Perhaps you should figure out better ways of managing money, more
&gt; generally?  If the money is in an account that doesn't have an ATM
&gt; or checking
&gt; account attached to it, that helps.

I don't understand the &quot;it's water under the bridge&quot; comment.  What's
the &quot;it&quot;?  You do know that this was all a dream, right?

&gt; Lot's of issues here.  First of all, you've got to bring order to this
&gt; situation.  It's foreign for some people to think that a financial
&gt; negotiation actually has to take place in situations like this, but
&gt; they do.  And it goes well beyond a will, although that's a piece of
&gt; the picture.

&gt; What you've got to do for the financial aspects of this is to approach
&gt; it like a business partnership in many ways.  Sit down by yourself or
&gt; with someone who's financial acumen you trust, and lay out a proposed
&gt; partnership arrangement that you think would work.  Whether it's
&gt; through combining your finances, or separating them, or an agreement
&gt; as to who owns what, and who gets what in the case of infirmity or
&gt; death, or any other issues that come up, you've got to spell it all
&gt; out.

&gt; You've also got to figure out why you're in a situation where, if he
&gt; goes, all you've got are the clothes on your back?  Is he in any
&gt; better situation?  If so, is it because he earns more than you, or
&gt; because of some other factors?  IOW, if you had never hooked up with
&gt; this guy, would you be any better off on your own and single?  If not,
&gt; then I'm not sure blaming him for the fact that this is the way it
&gt; would be if he left is fair to him unless there's an agreement between
&gt; you that you should stay home, or work part time, or otherwise inhibit
&gt; your revenue generating capabilities for the relationship, and if
&gt; that's the case, then don't do that anymore.

&gt; However, if you'd be capable of fully supporting yourself on your own,
&gt; then why are you bothered?

&gt; Anyway, once you've got the finances straightened out, then you've got
&gt; to bring order to the rest of the relationship, but again, you've got
&gt; to realize that you cannot hold him responsible for your decisions.
&gt; If you choose to stay with *him*, then realize that person he is, and
&gt; don't hold him responsible for not being who you want him to be.  Take
&gt; him for who *he* is, warts and all, or don't take him at all.

&gt; &gt;&gt; One of the few things that I've really learned is that you can't look
&gt; &gt;&gt; at someone else's behavior and judge it the same way that you would
&gt; &gt;&gt; your own... that is, if it were up to *you*, you would make this
&gt; &gt;&gt; happen before buying the motorcycle stuff, because that would be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; sign to you that the relationship is important, etc.  He might have
&gt; &gt;&gt; totally different reasons... and in fact, one of them might be, it
&gt; &gt;&gt; just doesn't occur to him that this is important.  Or how important it
&gt; &gt;&gt; is to you.  That doesn't mean necessarily that he doesn't love you or
&gt; &gt;&gt; value the relationship, but that he doesn't see this one thing as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; big thing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But in a healthy relationship, partners have to understand what the
&gt; &gt;&gt; other person needs.  And you need for this wedding to happen, for a
&gt; &gt;&gt; collection of reasons, both practical and because it is important to
&gt; &gt;&gt; you.  And it seems that the possibilities are, he knows that but
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't really care, or that he doesn't know that... or doesn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; *understand* it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What would happen if you said, I want to get married now, even if it
&gt; &gt;&gt; is just going down to city hall, and this is more important to me than
&gt; &gt;&gt; anything else?

&gt; &gt;He *knows* how important this is to me. From an emotional and legal
&gt; &gt;standpoint. We *still* say we should have gotten married when we were
&gt; &gt;21 instead of letting our parents run our lives.

&gt; &gt;I've told him I want to be married. But he wants to have a party,
&gt; &gt;friends over etc. because my first wedding *was* at city hall. I don't
&gt; &gt;want to do it up like he did for his first. It put them $12K in debt
&gt; &gt;in 1992. I feel now like it was, and still is, an empty promise.

&gt; &gt;Besides, we can't do *anything* about it until my BC and those divorce
&gt; &gt;decrees are found. And I'm *not* paying $200 to get copies because he
&gt; &gt;lost them either. He can find the money if he wants to get duplicates
&gt; &gt;from the court. But, alas, he hasn't even tried to find the originals
&gt; &gt;yet, so that is a nonissue.

&gt; I'm just saying, you can assume that he really knows all
&gt; this/understands all this, and then you have to conclude the only
&gt; logical thing... he doesn't really care particularly about any of it,
&gt; and he's just stringing you along....  and then, why are you
&gt; bothering?

&gt; Or you can assume that maybe he doesn't understand what's important to
&gt; you and what you want... including this thing about having a megabucks
&gt; wedding when you'd be just as happy with a trip to city hall.  In
&gt; which case, it might be better to start by sitting down and really
&gt; talking about this, going back to square 1.  &quot;I want to get married
&gt; now because it is important to me.&quot;  &quot;I do NOT want a big party.&quot;  &quot;I
&gt; want you to either come up with the papers or arrange to get new ones
&gt; NOW, because I feel both hurt and angry that you haven't done this.&quot;
&gt; And see where it takes you.- Hide quoted text -
">

The only thing I might change is &quot;I do NOT want a big party&quot; to &quot;I do
NOT need a big party&quot;. He wants it, I don't. Frankly, I think he wants
it because if we don't have one his older sisters will be put out.
&quot;You got MARRIED and didn't invite US?!!!&quot;

No. But I wouldn't put it past him. The paint job he's thinking about

The kids would not have moved the papers. They didn't know what or

Maybe your fiance is like my DH. He really wanted a big wedding. He
has a big family, and it's expected that when you get married, you
throw a big party for the whole family. He also dreamed of wearing his
kilt, and having his three brothers in the wedding party wearing their
kilts too.

Meanwhile, I saw little sense in spending that kind of dough,
considering it's a second marriage for both of us, and we have kids
who are teens and will need financial support for college. IMO, it's
one thing to blow that kind of cash when you are just starting out and
don't have kids. Quite another when you already have kids. Just didn't
make any sense to me. I just wanted a small, non-nonsense ceremony
with just the two of us and the kids, with a JP. He thought I was
being unromantic, I thought I was being practical.

He could've easily said to me, &quot;Gee, aren't *I* worth having a big to-

It's not the monetary &quot;I'm worth it&quot;. It's the legal committment to me
and our relationship &quot;I'm worth it&quot;. It's &quot;I'm worth it&quot; to take the
time, get a licence (a mere $100, and good for 3 months in Ontario),
pick a weekend, and just do it.

If it really were monetary then it would be &quot;I'm worth dropping 4
grand for a party we really don't need to have for a second wedding&quot;
or the same 12 grand he spent on his first wedding and honeymoon in
England.

I just feel like the proposal was a fishing expedition and he landed
the stupid one. I bought it. I also feel like buying the rings and the
attendant gifts was a waste of money. His wedding band is engraved,
can't do anything with that. The attendants gifts are engraved too. My
wedding ring has never been worn but to try on.

I just feel like I'm in a holding pattern, awaiting his whim again to
acually do the deed. I'd have been happier had he never proposed. Then
I wouldn't feel gypped. I was happy just being with him with no
expectations of a wedding, or a baby. Then he ruined the whole thing
by popping the question.

I totally agree - that was my attitude exactly!

My point is, maybe he wants something different? And he has a right to
want something different. Some men are sentimental creatures. My DH is
one of them. Yours might be, too.

And maybe he has a complex about not being able to provide for you the
way he wants to?

No. He's not having an affair. He can't keep his hands off me and he
gets it REGULARLY.

He just doesn't seem to want to write off the baby thing, which in
itself is confusing. Why not let me get an IUD? He didn't want me to
discuss that with the doctor either...

I'm sensing something with you, and I can just barely put my finger on
it, but what I'm sensing is that you might have colder feet than you
are admitting to yourself.

Initially, you were the one that didn't want to get married. And then
he gave you an engagement ring, which you accepted. I dunno. It's like
maybe you're now pushing him hard enough that you'll know it'll
backfire in your face, that he'll run away, that he'll call the whole
thing off...  because you secretly WANT him to run away?

I dunno... I can't explain this. It's just a sense I'm having.  It's
like you are picking fights with him deliberately.

He may also be doing some of that, too.

You're being way too passive about this.

It is true that you can't make your whatever-he-is do anything.  But
it is time to start thinking about what you want.

I may be wrong, but I'm getting the feeling from you that being
married to someone is more important than _who_ you are with, which I
think is a strategic mistake.

You said you are 41 I think, and you also said you are &quot;too old&quot; to
&quot;start over.&quot;  I'm not sure what you mean by that.  That is, I'm not
sure what you are &quot;too old&quot; for and I'm also not sure what you mean by
&quot;start over.&quot;

If you mean &quot;move out and live on your own&quot;  I don't think you are too
old for that.  If you mean &quot;start a new relationship with a person you
like,&quot;  I don't feel like you are too old for that either.

You've framed the marriage discussion as &quot;he doesn't think you are
worth it&quot; and I agree with AllYou, that this is a bad way to think
about it.

Much better, IMO, to be crystal clear with him about what _you_ want,
and (since _you_ are the one who wants it) presenting a reasonable
plan that involves _you_ taking the steps necessary to make that
happen.

Obviously if what you really want is to get married, you can't do that
without his cooperation, but you don't need _much_ cooperation from
him - you can set everything up, he will need to go with you to
whatever government office you have to go to in Ontario, and will have
to be willing to sign various bits of paperwork.

He provides just fine (when some schmuck doesn't owe us $10 G). He
pays the bills, fixes the vehicles, gets groceries and stuff for the
kids. Upgrades our computers and network (for our business), gets us
laptops (also for business and my college), and gets me jewellery and
clothes. He provides JUST FINE.

I know he was very concerned about getting married and not including
his sisters. Outside of his son, they mean a lot to him. Since both of
his parents are now deceased, his sisters are all he has left. I also
know his sisters well enough that even if we were to run off to
Niagara, they would be put out because it *is* only a 1 1/2 hour drive
from home... Frankly, they can get stuffed. If he wants to have the
party for their benefit (ie. their inclusion) then they can pay for
it. Especially since the eldest is married to a multi-millionaire.

I did want to get married. But I wasn't ready to discuss it while we
were both freshly separated/divorced. We both felt betrayed by our
exes, their affairs and their lies. So, we agreed not to discuss it
till we were both ready to. And I mean to discuss planning OUR wedding
to each other.

At the beginning, I was happy just to be together with the
understanding it was permanent. And for 1 1/2 years that's all it was.
There was no talk of marriage, no talk of babies. Just that we loved
each other and were happy to be together.

Then it all went to heck when out of the blue he asked me, and not
very romantically I might add, if I wanted to be permanently stuck
with him. I said &quot;what, get married?&quot; and he said yeah. Next thing I
knew we spent the next 4 months looking for an engagement ring. We
ended up buying the first one we looked at back in March.

I haven't talked about getting married since June when we went on
holidays. He must have remembered a comment I made the year before,
after coming home from the same trip, that would could have been
married in New York by the Mayor of Lake George. He even brought my
wedding ring with him, withouth my knowing. Silly man, he didn't
realized we'd have to bring proof of our divorces to get the
license... That's when I realized the papers were missing.

I don't want to push him into getting married if he doesn't feel
ready, for whatever reason. We both got married to the wrong people 15
years ago, and for the wrong reasons. I don't want to give him a cause
to regret me. So, I don't push. HE brought up babies, and I put two
and two together about the married thing.

Well, I did all the setting up three times before, and all he had to
do was give me the cash I needed to secure the church and the
officiant and the catering. And he didn't. So, I'm not doing it again.
I've had to call our pastor three times to cancel and I've had enough
of that humiliation.

When I've calmed down, can stop crying when I think of the waste of
the last 5 years, and can pull myself together enough to talk to him
about this, I will tell HIM &quot;you name the time and place and I'll be
there&quot;. If he says anything other than &quot;I've got it covered&quot;, then I
move my stuff to the spare bedroom and start socking money away to
move out and dissolve our business.

It sounds to me like the two of you are playing a little game here,
called &quot;hold the baby for ransom.&quot; You didn't even want to get married
to him in the first place, but after you accepted his engagement ring,
suddenly your tune changed, you suddenly realized you might want to
have another baby.

Did you think that maybe this would frighten him into revoking his
proposal?

And now when you fight, the baby is held up again between you, as a
threat. He retaliates by threatening not to have a baby with you.

Do you think this is his way of making you mad enough to break off the
engagement?

Or perhaps it is a test. Perhaps you are testing each other? Perhaps
you are testing just how committed to this whole marriage idea he is.
Is he committed enough to be open to the idea of having a baby?

Are you committed enough to marrying him that if he would NOT have a
baby, that would be okay (because you want to be married to him - not
just to have a baby before it's too late)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  He
&gt; didn't say &quot;ever&quot;.

Which was probably a clue that he was testing you, to see if it was
him you wanted, or a baby you wanted.

Maybe he sees right through your whole baby threat, and knows you only
started clamoring for a baby because you thought it would frighten him
off?

Poor guy. If he was testing you, you failed. But he actually loves you
enough not to see you get a tubal and close down that baby dream.

Cheap shot. Do you REALLY believe he's that way? If you do, then get
out now.

If you don't, then take a deep breathe, calm down, and grow up. Get
the two of you into some counseling pronto, to learn better ways to

individual counseling for yourself, to explore what's going on, what
you really want.

I would also encourage both of you to spend time making sure you've

time to move on from divorce. You both moved in together very quickly,

Frankly, if this is the way you fight, you both have a long way to go
until you're going to be ready for a marriage, but it's not
impossible. And I think, deep down, BOTH of you know you're not ready.
BOTH of you have your doubts. This isn't about just him having doubts.
You have a fair share of your own.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just feel like the proposal was a fishing expedition and he landed

&gt; &gt; &gt; attendant gifts was a waste of money. His wedding band is engraved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't do anything with that. The attendants gifts are engraved too. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; wedding ring has never been worn but to try on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just feel like I'm in a holding pattern, awaiting his whim again to

&gt; &gt; &gt; expectations of a wedding, or a baby. Then he ruined the whole thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; by popping the question.

&gt; &gt; I'm sensing something with you, and I can just barely put my finger on
&gt; &gt; it, but what I'm sensing is that you might have colder feet than you
&gt; &gt; are admitting to yourself.

&gt; &gt; Initially, you were the one that didn't want to get married. And then
&gt; &gt; he gave you an engagement ring, which you accepted. I dunno. It's like
&gt; &gt; maybe you're now pushing him hard enough that you'll know it'll
&gt; &gt; backfire in your face, that he'll run away, that he'll call the whole
&gt; &gt; thing off...  because you secretly WANT him to run away?

&gt; &gt; I dunno... I can't explain this. It's just a sense I'm having.  It's
&gt; &gt; like you are picking fights with him deliberately.

&gt; &gt; He may also be doing some of that, too.

&gt; &gt; jen- Hide quoted text -

&gt; I did want to get married. But I wasn't ready to discuss it while we
&gt; were both freshly separated/divorced. We both felt betrayed by our
&gt; exes, their affairs and their lies. So, we agreed not to discuss it
&gt; till we were both ready to. And I mean to discuss planning OUR wedding
&gt; to each other.

&gt; At the beginning, I was happy just to be together with the
&gt; understanding it was permanent. And for 1 1/2 years that's all it was.
&gt; There was no talk of marriage, no talk of babies. Just that we loved
&gt; each other and were happy to be together.

&gt; Then it all went to heck when out of the blue he asked me, and not
&gt; very romantically I might add, if I wanted to be permanently stuck
&gt; with him. I said &quot;what, get married?&quot; and he said yeah. Next thing I
&gt; knew we spent the next 4 months looking for an engagement ring. We
&gt; ended up buying the first one we looked at back in March.

&gt; I haven't talked about getting married since June when we went on
&gt; holidays. He must have remembered a comment I made the year before,
&gt; after coming home from the same trip, that would could have been
&gt; married in New York by the Mayor of Lake George. He even brought my
&gt; wedding ring with him, withouth my knowing. Silly man, he didn't
&gt; realized we'd have to bring proof of our divorces to get the
&gt; license... That's when I realized the papers were missing.

&gt; I don't want to push him into getting married if he doesn't feel
&gt; ready, for whatever reason. We both got married to the wrong people 15
&gt; years ago, and for the wrong reasons. I don't want to give him a cause
&gt; to regret me. So, I don't push. HE brought up babies, and I put two
&gt; and two together about the married thing.
">

I really think you've got to reach better clarity.

It is sensible not to push marriage.

But then he probably _doesn't_ understand how important it is to you,
so you shouldn't be getting furious at him for not making it a
priority.

Given how important it is to you (and I'd think very carefully about
whether _you_ really think he is a good person for you to marry), not
telling him that is sabotaging your relationship.

If you don't want to push him, then don't tell him he _should_ marry
you, or that he has an obligation to marry you, or any of those
things.  Tell him it is what _you_ want, but only if he feels certain
about making a permanent committment (and only if _you_ feel certain
about that - do you really?).

&gt; Do you think this is his way of making you mad enough to break off the

&gt; Or perhaps it is a test. Perhaps you are testing each other? Perhaps
&gt; you are testing just how committed to this whole marriage idea he is.
&gt; Is he committed enough to be open to the idea of having a baby?

&gt; Are you committed enough to marrying him that if he would NOT have a
&gt; baby, that would be okay (because you want to be married to him - not
&gt; just to have a baby before it's too late)?

&gt; &gt;  He
&gt; &gt; didn't say &quot;ever&quot;.

&gt; Which was probably a clue that he was testing you, to see if it was
&gt; him you wanted, or a baby you wanted.

&gt; Maybe he sees right through your whole baby threat, and knows you only

&gt; off?

&gt; &gt; But I did tell him I would make sure it wouldn't
&gt; &gt; happen.  He then said not to run out and get a tubal... WTF?!!

&gt; Poor guy. If he was testing you, you failed. But he actually loves you
&gt; enough not to see you get a tubal and close down that baby dream.

&gt; &gt; Then he
&gt; &gt; said we just simply wouldn't have sex.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is that to just go do the deed and get it done is a lousy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $200 bucks and a couple hours of his time. I think I'm worth it. We
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can always have a catered party at the house later... Unless I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *not*
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worth it or he just proposed to keep me in a holding pattern.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing good can ever come of putting a monetary value on things like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this.  The whole &quot;am I worth it&quot; is a huge mistake.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not the monetary &quot;I'm worth it&quot;. It's the legal committment to me

&gt; &gt; &gt; by popping the question.

&gt; &gt; You're being way too passive about this.

&gt; &gt; It is true that you can't make your whatever-he-is do anything.  But
&gt; &gt; it is time to start thinking about what you want.

&gt; &gt; I may be wrong, but I'm getting the feeling from you that being
&gt; &gt; married to someone is more important than _who_ you are with, which I
&gt; &gt; think is a strategic mistake.

&gt; &gt; You said you are 41 I think, and you also said you are &quot;too old&quot; to
&gt; &gt; &quot;start over.&quot;  I'm not sure what you mean by that.  That is, I'm not
&gt; &gt; sure what you are &quot;too old&quot; for and I'm also not sure what you mean by
&gt; &gt; &quot;start over.&quot;

&gt; &gt; If you mean &quot;move out and live on your own&quot;  I don't think you are too
&gt; &gt; old for that.  If you mean &quot;start a new relationship with a person you
&gt; &gt; like,&quot;  I don't feel like you are too old for that either.

&gt; &gt; You've framed the marriage discussion as &quot;he doesn't think you are
&gt; &gt; worth it&quot; and I agree with AllYou, that this is a bad way to think
&gt; &gt; about it.

&gt; &gt; Much better, IMO, to be crystal clear with him about what _you_ want,
&gt; &gt; and (since _you_ are the one who wants it) presenting a reasonable
&gt; &gt; plan that involves _you_ taking the steps necessary to make that
&gt; &gt; happen.

&gt; &gt; Obviously if what you really want is to get married, you can't do that
&gt; &gt; without his cooperation, but you don't need _much_ cooperation from
&gt; &gt; him - you can set everything up, he will need to go with you to
&gt; &gt; whatever government office you have to go to in Ontario, and will have
&gt; &gt; to be willing to sign various bits of paperwork.

&gt; Well, I did all the setting up three times before, and all he had to
&gt; do was give me the cash I needed to secure the church and the
&gt; officiant and the catering.
">

No, that doesn't count.  Making a plan that requires having a lot of
money without having a plan that involves _getting_ that money doesn't
count as setting things up.

The cash you need is only $200 or $300, right?  All the rest (church,
catering, whatever) is not necessary.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And he didn't. So, I'm not doing it again.
&gt; I've had to call our pastor three times to cancel and I've had enough
&gt; of that humiliation.

&gt; When I've calmed down, can stop crying when I think of the waste of
&gt; the last 5 years, and can pull myself together enough to talk to him
&gt; about this, I will tell HIM &quot;you name the time and place and I'll be
&gt; there&quot;. If he says anything other than &quot;I've got it covered&quot;, then I
&gt; move my stuff to the spare bedroom and start socking money away to
&gt; move out and dissolve our business.
">

Wait - you _know_ he doesn't have it covered.  You know there are
money concerns for a wedding and a wedding party.  So you might be better
off skipping that step.

I don't think you two _should_ get married.  The more of your posts I
read, the more convincing it is that there are a _lot_ of unresolved
issues for both of you, and that you are really unlikely to _stay_
married.

But, if you wanted to try something that might get what you say you
want (to be married) how about saying &quot;I really want us to be married,
for the legal security, and for the representation of a permanent
committment.  We can't afford a big party, and we've tried before and
had to cancel.  So let's just do the legal stuff, without the
party.  We can invite your sisters to come be witnesses.  It will cost
$300 (or whatever it costs).  No church.  No reception.  No gown,
bridesmaid's dresses, whatever.&quot;

This is how my wife and I got married (though without your boyfriend's
sisters), and it worked for us.  We're in year 26 now, so the size and
expense of the wedding is not a good predictor of the length of the
marriage.

conclude that you will not marry him, and that you'll keep the
relationships at that level until *you* decide that *you* need more,
and then, when that happens, *you'll* do what *you* have to do.  Tell
him that the next time he brings it up, he'd better only do so if he's
ready, willing, and able to commit to a date.

In the last couple of years of my marriage, I went through a relative
degree of emotional pain always thinking that a particular night was
*the* night that we'd make love.  Finally, I decided that I'd no
longer think that, and that under no circumstances would I ever lull
myself into believing it would happen.

IOW, I reclaimed full control over my circumstances and my life, and I
can't begin to tell you what a relief it was.  There were even a
couple of times where she offered sex, and I absolutely refused it in
no uncertain circumstances.  I did so because I knew that if I went
back once, then I'd always be hoping for the next offer, and back to
wondering if that night was *the* night.

She had always exercised some degree of control over me in that way,
but once I reclaimed control, I basically reclaimed my life.  Although
a life without sex sucked (NPI), it was wonderful compared to the
alternative, and it added to the freedom I felt to make decisions for
myself and my own life.

I had another experience in my life where my daughter's birth father
kept threatening to withhold support payments for any number of
reasons, most of which were only tangentially connected to my
daughter.  My X and I were young and needed the money, and so we ceded
all sorts of control to him over our lives that made no sense.  The
mere threat of not keeping him in a cooperative mood allowed him much
too much control over us.  Finally, I came to my senses, and decided
that no amount of money was worth it, and told him to send the money
because it was his responsibility, and that we would no longer comply
with any of his dictates or requests except to the extent that we
decided they had merit, and that we'd notify the authorities if he
didn't meet his obligations.

He didn't, and we did, and we lived the rest of the time that my
daughter lived at home with great peace of mind, at least on that
front.  (We also eventually got the money from him, but through the
state)

The moral to both of those stories is that you've got to reclaim your
life.  You can never allow anyone to dangle a carrot in front of you
and use it as a means of control, even if they have no such intent.
Reclaim control of your life by resolving that the marriage will not
happen until he sets a date, and make sure that he knows not to
mention it again until then.  Do this, and free yourself.

That is one thing I'm not quite getting. On the one hand, Stevie, you
are saying if he really wanted to be married to you, he would do X
(settle for a smaller wedding, or save for a bigger wedding instead of
spending it on motorcycle parts, or get the paperwork taken care of).

On the other hand, there are quite a few things *you* don't seem to be
willing to compromise on, and one could just as easily say, if you
really wanted to be married you'd do Y (take care of the paperwork even
though it wasn't your doing, be willing to spend at least a little on a
small ceremony and reception so there's something to invite his sisters to).
