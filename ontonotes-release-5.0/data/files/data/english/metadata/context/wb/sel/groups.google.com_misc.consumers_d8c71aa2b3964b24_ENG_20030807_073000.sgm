Why is it that you never see fat chicks in those Victoria's Secret
commercials or fashion shows? No fat chicks on their website either.

Enlighten me.

"/> i would think two main reasons

1) it would turn off guys. guys who visit the store to buy stuff for their
gf's, read the catalog etc.
2) it would turn off some of the prospective hawt women because v.secret
would lose some cachet/appeal to them, if it was a company that also
serviced the adipose enhanced. iow, victorias secret features hawt chix,
and women who buy from v.secret crave that image, and want to see themself
in that group.

there is definitely a market for lingerie for fat women, but v.secret
probably considered alienating its core clientele by expanding (no pun
intended) into that area.

i would imagine there are plenty of other companies to fill that niche, and
if there aren't - there's money to be made.

but image is extremely important, especially to a company like v.secret.

as soon as they dilute that image, they lose.

Fat chicks are usually more fun in the sack. They're willing and wild.
Compensating for not looking like a Vicky's Secret model.

Your model types are usually snobbish about their looks. They think that
looking good and being there is enough.

It's a rare day you find the proper combination of good looks and good
attitude, perhaps with a dash of intelligence thrown in.

LMAO! Congratulations - you have a well-developed sense of humor!

Morbidly obese - hell no. Linked pic - no way.

This all hinges on one's definition of &quot;fat&quot;. If you mean anyone larger than
a VS model, there's some way-fine fat chicks. 10, 15, even 20 pounds over
&quot;ideal&quot; - sure. More than that, depends on how they carry it. Big tits, but
slightly thicker? Yeah, and that's what I was referring to. Complete bowl of
jiggling blubber? Dust her in flour, slap a thigh and ride the wave in? No
way. You're average, girl-next-door type, sure. If your cutoff is 50 pounds
more than yourself, fuggheddaboutit.

Let's talk quasi-celebs, roughly 40-ish. Gives us a good cross-section to
make comparisons. Take these for example:

Patricia Richardson, Tim Allen's wife on Home Improvement. VS Model? Nope.
She's not skinny or scrawny. She's got some meat on her bones. I'm sure
she's above her &quot;ideal&quot; weight. I'm sure she has a BMI above what's
&quot;recommended&quot;. That said, I'd take her to Alaska and screw her all night.
Same with Demi Moore, or Cybill Shepherd.

OTOH, take Roseanne Barr. Mimi on the Drew Carey Show. Or even Sandra
Bernhardt, who is &quot;thin&quot;. Not a chance in hell. 'Nuff said.

I've run the gamut - hot &amp; great, hot &amp; lousy, not hot but great, not hot
and lousy. By percentage, &quot;not hot but great&quot; wins out. Gimme a chick who
*thinks* she has something to compensate for!

Parting shot - Mary-Ann, or Ginger? I'm all about Mary-Ann.

A: They have to.

Besides, with those lip, tongue and jaw muscles so toned and tireless
from years of masticating every bit of food that enters their
gravitational orbit, fat chicks tend to give pretty good head.
Plus, all it costs is an all-you-can-eat dinner at a buffet restaurant.
Or so I've been told.

&gt; Compensating for not looking like a Vicky's Secret model.

"/> There is nothing a fat chick can do to compensate for not looking
like a Victoria's Secret model.

A Victoria's Secret model can get a man excited without even trying.
How can a fat chick compensate for that? The more you can see the
fat chick trying to compensate, the more of a turnoff that is.

If fat chicks really want to compensate for not looking like a
Victoria's Secret model, they would stop swilling doughnuts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They think that looking good and being there is enough.

"/> They &quot;think&quot; this because they have observed it repeatedly. Women
who look good enough to appear in Victoria's Secret catalogs generally
don't have to make any particular effort to attract men and get them
sexually excited. A beautiful woman only needs to show up and let
a man get a good unobstructed look at her.

But this is not to say a beautiful woman is never willing to do
anything more than that. Beautiful women can fall in love like
any other woman.

A beautiful woman will be snobbish toward most men who find her
attractive simply because the number of men who want beautiful
women is vastly greater than the number of beautiful women. But the
beautiful woman isn't going to be snobbish toward EVERY man. She
is a lot pickier than a fat chick, but the odds are she spends more
of her time with men she has picked.

"/>&quot;Good attitude&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;enthusiastic receptivity toward
you and only you.&quot;

Few men are desirable enough to women to elicit enthusiastic receptivity
from a detectable fraction of women with good looks.

That is why men will have to use their own dash of intelligence to
invent artificial companions who look and behave as we want.

Dude, if all she does is show up and you're ready, that's pathetic. That
kind of crap you can expect from a 17yo desperate guy.

If she's got a shitty attitude, ain't no amount of good looks gonna make up
for that. She might get a dirty sanchez for her bitchiness, though.

Does it help for a woman to be attractive? Hell yes. Is that all that
matters? Hell no.

And good attitude is defined differently in my book. If she's a dead-fuck,
or an attention hound, or a gold-digger, or psycho, or countless other
attitude problems, she'll get a fake name, and I'll fuck her at her place.
&quot;It's all about me!&quot; is bullshit.

If she's into it, and reciprocates, and has fun, that's part of having a
good attitude. A smile, a flirtiness, a sparkle in her eye - that'll get me
going a lot faster than a pair of fake tits stuffed into a &quot;Princess&quot; shirt.

&gt;&gt; Why is it that you never see fat chicks in those Victoria's Secret
&gt;&gt; commercials or fashion shows? No fat chicks on their website either.

&gt;&gt; Enlighten me.

&gt; i would think two main reasons

&gt; 1) it would turn off guys. guys who visit the store to buy stuff for
their
&gt; gf's, read the catalog etc.
&gt; 2) it would turn off some of the prospective hawt women because v.secret
&gt; would lose some cachet/appeal to them, if it was a company that also
&gt; serviced the adipose enhanced. iow, victorias secret features hawt chix,
&gt; and women who buy from v.secret crave that image, and want to see themself
&gt; in that group.

&gt; there is definitely a market for lingerie for fat women, but v.secret
&gt; probably considered alienating its core clientele by expanding (no pun
&gt; intended) into that area.

&gt; i would imagine there are plenty of other companies to fill that niche,

&gt; if there aren't - there's money to be made.

&gt; but image is extremely important, especially to a company like v.secret.

&gt; as soon as they dilute that image, they lose.

Thought of this today, reminded me of this thread.

&quot;Baby Got Back&quot; - Sir Mix-A-Lot, no copyright infringement intended...

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancin'
The hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(LA face with Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

[Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Watchin' these bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}
If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!}
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3&quot;.

[Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups,
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that &quot;hard&quot; role
And tell you that the butt ain't go
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

(Little in the middle but she got much back) [4x]

chicks and society views thin chicks as more sexually desirable than fat
chicks. If you want to do business with a company that takes the
opposite view, try shopping at Lane Bryant.

&gt; Saving up for a &quot;Real Doll&quot; then?

"/> A RealDoll does not behave as I want. They also don't look quite right
from what I have seen. But they do look better than most women.

It will take quite a while for the computer industry to develop
a human-level speech interface. Until you are routinely conversing
with your computer and you still have to do household chores yourself,
the enabling technologies for satisfying artificial companions are not
there yet.

But even today it would probably be possible to build a RealDoll
around a Honda ASIMO-type robot frame (scaled appropriately) and
program it to be a pretty good, if mute, club dancer. Honda
recently demonstrated ASIMO performing traditional Indonesian
dances. To avoid scaring* people, Honda's engineers deliberately
designed ASIMO to look obviously mechanical, but they could just
as easily make it look like any actress on Baywatch, etc.

No doubt someone soon will.

[*The fear factor would result from the inconsistent sensory cues
a human observer would get from something that looks human in some
ways but obviously non-human in others. Until roboticists can
deliver the &quot;total package&quot; it will be much better for public
relations if they make sure the robot's shell could never be
mistaken for a human. A RealDoll tends to freak most people out for
a similar reason---it looks human in some ways but is obviously
not human in other ways. Perhaps the fear derives from the same
mechanism Carl Sagan hypothesized to explain why most people feel
horrified by the sight of dead human bodies---the presence of a
dead human body suggests the continuing presence of whatever hazard
might have killed that person. A person who becomes afraid and
leaves the area is more likely to survive and pass on his or her
genes than a brave person who feels no fear, remains near the
dead body, and becomes the next victim. In the ancestral environment,
hardly anybody lived long enough to die of old age, so it was
probably a good survival heuristic for hominids to develop their
fear of dead human bodies. A dead body was probably a fairly
accurate predictor of continuing danger.]

&gt; I just wait a minute or two, crack open the door and invite him in --
&gt; long as it is a single room. Mixed company might not go for that sort of
&gt; thing.
&gt; Only thing I ever got was a few funny looks on the way out.

&gt; Easy enough to deal with. Look em dead in the eyes and smile.

&gt; VS has some really nice clothes. They feel good against the skin. I used
&gt; to like some of Fredricks stuff but never stockings, nor most lingerie.
&gt; They were not soft and more often than not felt scratchy.

"/> I don't get much of a chance to &quot;dress up&quot; very often. But I like nice
underthings that fit well. It's my little luxury. And VS just seems to
fit the best.

I spend alot of time in men's work clothes. Once at work I spilled
some solvent on my work shirt so I whipped it off to get it away from
my skin and you should have seen the jaws drop. The guys I work with
just stood there like a bunch of goons with their mouths open. It was
pretty funny.

of my jobs are pretty demanding physically. But I bicycle alot. And I
swim and hike when I get the chance. I have not found the need for a
special sports bra. In fact, when I get home, I take my bra off. I go
braless whenever I can.

&gt;Probably because Victoria's Secret's products are geared toward thin
&gt;chicks and society views thin chicks as more sexually desirable than fat
&gt;chicks.

"/> By a wide margin. Even NAAFA (National Association to Advance Fat
Acceptance) agrees with this. From
http://www.naafa.org/documents/policies/fat_admirers.html  :

&quot;Based on anecdotal evidence, five to ten percent of the population has a
sexual preference for a fat partner.&quot;

Couple that with the fact that 65% of the US population is either
overweight or obese, it is plain to see that most men who are with fat
women are settling for what they can get and not what they desire. Many
fat acceptors have whined that women outnumber men at BBW(sic) dances by a
margin of 4 to 1 or more. Photographic evidence on fat acceptance web
sites confirms the lopsided ratio of women to men.

the right type of women? For instance, one of my girlfriends had wide
hips. VS stuff never really fit her hips and accentuated -- deleteriously -
- her hips. On the other hand, she found a one-piece swimsuit (not from
VS) that had a small &quot;skirt&quot; on the bottom. This covered her hips and was

You wonder why? How about because of the men who have the same kind of
mentality you have. Women who are overweight don't need idiots like
you inquiring for them. The term &quot;fat chicks&quot; is not a very nice one.
I'm sure you didn't really want to know. If you did, you'd email
Victoria Secret. It seems you just wanted to find a way to make fun of
someone. I wonder if your insecure and have a need to put others down

she's 100lbs overweight and the weight is all fat - but most women ain't
that big.

You of course do know what a lot of Asian women prefer, right? Besides,
after fucking a cute asian chick, experience tells me it isn't all that
except that she looks good on your arm. In bed it ain't much at all. If the
lights go out, any guy whose hormones are more fixed on performance than
looks, is going to go to sleep right there and then.

Clarice and Allisson were well beyond a BMI of 25 in their pictures where
they were called cows.
