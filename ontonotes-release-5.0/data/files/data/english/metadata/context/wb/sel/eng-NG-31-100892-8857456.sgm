Here is an explanation of why I think that ideas are not expressed
through or by language. My original post was exploratory, but
certainly not idly made. I will reply to other posts, but I have given
a new post because there seems a lot of replies that I had not
expected:

We do not express ideas through language...I will give an analogy: I
do not see colours through sight, I simply see colours, and sight is
defined through that. Yet we would not say that sight is colours. And
we could not say that sight is seeing colours, or even that it is the
organ of sight.

In other words, I do not display my ideas through language, I simply
display my ideas. I cannot say I display ideas through language
because this would mean that language is an object I use to express
myself. But language is not the means of making it, and neither is it
the expression of any one idea or the accumulation of all
'expressable' ideas. Language is a FRAMEWORK, and not an object in a
framework. A framework is not surveyable -- so I cannot say 'I express
my ideas through language', because this simultaneously treats
language as an unsurveyable framework, and an object in its own
framework.

What I wanted to draw attention to was the peculiar status of
frameworks. I wanted to explore that status through criticisms, like
Gordge's---

Me: &gt; The truth of language is that no ideas can be expressed through
it, or

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; by it.
">

Gordge: So that idea can be ignored as the truth about the truth of
language.

These criticisms seem common in self-reference (or elsewhere?), yet I
think they ignore distinctions of object and framework. There are some
similarities with Kantian doctrine too, where framework and object
distinctions also arise.

Still, I think most people would not be taken aback by the expression &quot;I
express myself through language&quot;, any more than they would be by &quot;I express
myself through painting&quot;, or  &quot;...art&quot;, or  &quot;...music&quot;.   Few would argue
that any of these objects, if you want to define them as such, are the ideas
that are being expressed.  I suppose using the term &quot;framework&quot; to classify
the mode of communication is one way of pointing this out.

But I am not sure of why the point is so urgent.  Does equating language
with the idea expressed somehow make a person less authentic?  Or are there
significant social or psychological aspects here?  Or are you just working
up a paper?

Interesting observation though.

And yet, if language is not an object, what is it that linguists
study?

Furthermore, as I look at your post I discover that is made of
language, I do not grasp your ideas until I process the language.  You
say &quot; I do not display my ideas through language&quot; but to me it looks
precisely as if you do.  Perhaps this would all be clearer if you
would display some ideas here without using language, so we could see
the contrast.

If I look in a field and see flowers that is one thing but if someone
says flower bush I have to look again and add something to my
observation which is different than just &quot;seeing that&quot; it is what
epistemologists call &quot;seeing as&quot;

With language the distinction become &quot;knowing that&quot; vs &quot;knowing as&quot;
the later sometimes called knowing how.

Distinguishing knowing that from knowing how

...in epistemology in general, the kind of knowledge usually discussed
is propositional knowledge, also known as &quot;knowledge-that&quot; as opposed
to &quot;know-how&quot;.

To exemplify the distinction: in mathematics, there is knowing that 2
+ 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to count to 4. Or, one knows
how to ride a bicycle and one knows that a bicycle has two wheels.

The distinction is between theoretical reason and practical reason,
with epistemology being interested in knowledge of the theoretical
kind, not the practical kind.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

The distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge has
sometimes been expressed in terms of knowing-how and knowing-that,
respectively, or in terms of a corresponding distinction between
embodied knowledge and theoretical knowledge.

...[K]nowing-how or embodied knowledge is characteristic of the
expert, who acts, makes judgments, and so forth without explicitly
reflecting on the principles or rules involved. The expert works
without having a theory of his or her work; he or she just performs
skillfully without deliberation or focused attention.

...Knowing-that, by contrast, involves consciously accessible
knowledge that can be articulated and is characteristic of the person
learning a skill through explicit instruction, recitation of rules,
attention to his or her movements, etc. While such declarative
knowledge may be needed for the acquisition of skills, the argument
goes, it no longer becomes necessary for the practice of those skills
once the novice becomes an expert in exercising them, and indeed it
does seem to be the case that, as Polanyi argued, when we acquire a
skill, we acquire a corresponding understanding that defies
articulation...

http://artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/tacitknowledge.html

One of the basic distinctions in epistemology ...is the distinction
between knowing that and knowing how. These are very different kinds
of knowing...

Knowing that is a relationship
between a person and a proposition;

this is the kind of knowing that has to do with content. So, for
example, we can know that a string is a null-terminated array of
characters in most C programs, but is an object in Java; we know that
Bush is president (not all knowledge makes one happy) or that Pedro
Martinez pitches for the Boston Red Sox. There is a lot of education
that is centered around expanding the set of things that we know that;
it is certainly the kind of thing that we are used to testing.

Knowing how is a different sort
of thing; it is the kind of
knowing that has to do with doing.

We know (most of us) how to walk; this doesn't require that we learn
the truth of a set of propositions. There are people who know the
physics of the way a baseball spinning interacts with the air to
change the nature of it's flight; this is a knowing that but is very
different than knowing how to throw a curve ball. In at least this
last case, society tends to reward those who know how more richly than
those who know that. But such is not always the case. We all know how
to do many things (healing a cut, recognize visual patterns) for which
there is hardly any knowing that.

The two kinds of knowing are entwined in interesting ways, especially
when it comes to education. When learning a new language, we begin by
accumulating vocabulary, grammar rules, and idioms (all instances of
knowing that) until, at some magic point, we know how to speak the
language. I have been told by a number of lawyers that the point of
law school is to get people to learn to think like lawyers; this is a
knowing how (and, perhaps, some violation of natural law).

Another way of viewing this distinction is by contrasting the content
of a field with the technique needed to be a practitioner in the
field. Some fields (history, physics) have lots and lots of content
that needs to be learned; others (law, mathematics, art, analytic
philosophy) are almost all technique. Just as there are different ways
of knowing, there are different ways of learning. To become an expert,
you need to learn the content of your field (the learning that) but
you also need to learn the techniques of your field (the learning
how).

http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=10522

In normal conversation we use knowledge to mean:

Knowing that (facts and information)

Knowing how (the ability to do something)

Sometimes, we use the word knowledge to mean that we have some
information, we know that Mary drinks lemonade, for example. When we
have this type of knowledge then we are able to express it. I cannot
say that I know when the Battle of Hastings took place, if I cannot,
under any circumstances, say the date! This is not true of knowing
how.

If I know how to swim, then when placed in the water I make certain
movements and do not sink! However, I may be unable to say how,
exactly, I am able to swim. Knowing how does not mean I know that ...
If I cannot say the date of the Battle of Hastings, I cannot be said
to know it. But if, while swimming, I cannot tell you exactly how I do
it, you cannot say I don't know how to swim!

Failing to understand the above can lead us into certain fallacies. If
we get instruction from the best public speaker  in the world, it does
not mean that because he or she can speak excellently, that they know
how to instruct others. They might be able to say what they do. For
example they might say how they practice. But this might work for them
and not for others! A much less able public speaker, or even one who
might never have spoken in public might be a much better teacher. The
point is that knowing that and knowing how are two different kinds of
knowledge!

In philosophy, knowing that something is the case implies that what is
known is true. Can we sensibly say that someone knows something, but
it isn't true? We cannot know that something is the case unless we are
able to show that it is also true.

I understand knowing that much better than I understand knowing how.
I know how to digest my lunch, I know how to heal a cut and cover it
with a scar.  At least, I can do these things.  Does being able to do
something automatically mean that you know how?  If so it seems to
extend knowing from the mind/brain where we frequently tend to place
it to the whole body.  We don't normally talk of this as &quot;knowledge.&quot;

I thought maybe I could make a distinction between &quot;knowing how&quot; that
I could teach, like throwing a curve ball from knowing how to heal a
cut.  But, on further thought, that line is very blurred.  Can Lance
Armstrong teach me how to ride a bike like he does?  So well I can win
the Tour de France?  His know how isn't just in his head, it's in his
muscles and whole body.  Is some of that knowledge and some other part
not knowledge?

Regarding language, people who like expressing themselves through
language probably get fulfillment from talking or writing. But I would
not take the enjoyment of expression through language to also be an
assertion of a relationship between expression and language.

Regarding your second point about finding a 'non-polemical' reason for
this idea of language. Strawson thought that Kant's idealism and the
'unknowable thing in itself' served no purpose and had nothing to
offer except a negative view of the world. Allison argued against
that, saying that Kant's 'unknowable thing in itself' was neither an
object nor a pointless idea, but served the positive purpose of
prioritising the framework of Kantian 'intuition' that is, of limiting
the excesses of reason and transcendent metaphysics and their creation
of objects that stood outside our intellect and 'intuition'.

Likewise, the excesses of standard claims made about language can be
limited by recasting it not so much in a Kantian model of intellect
and intuition (although, I argue that like Kantian 'intuition',
language is a framework and not an object) but in a model of framework
and object.

To be a little technical, and for my own notes, I say that language
traditionally has been interpreted as an object, and that apparant
circularities arise when its status as framework is invoked but not
recognised. For, the 'behaviours' of framework and object are not the
same. I might also say that language has been traditionally cast in
the philosophies of transcendental realism (empirical idealism), a
framework adopted by most western philosophies, and that time is ripe
for it to be considered in a transcendentally ideal mode or framework.

Linguists study the tools to facilitate, but not construct, the
emergence of language. Language emerges as a gestalt, independent of
the means used to create it. For example, we may, with great
deliberation, read or rather follow, a whole page that is lucidly and
simply constructed and in our own language, yet subsequently not be
able to report what the text is about. I am sure you have noticed this
phenomenon yourself. In other words, language is not constructed as a
result of deliberating over the sentence form or individual words, or
syntax what have you.

I don't display my ideas through language any more than I see colours
because of my sight. Just as there is no need to create a transcendent
metaphysical 'object' like sight, so there is no need to create a
metaphysical object called 'language'. Again, I say that language is a
framework and not an object. To ask to display an idea without using
language is like asking to show a colour without sight. I can show the
colour, and the colour can be seen, while 'sight' is neither denied
nor asserted, but merely dropped.

&gt; &gt; distinctions also arise.

&gt; If I look in a field and see flowers that is one thing but if someone
&gt; says flower bush I have to look again and add something to my
&gt; observation which is different than just &quot;seeing that&quot; it is what
&gt; epistemologists call &quot;seeing as&quot;

&gt; With language the distinction become &quot;knowing that&quot; vs &quot;knowing as&quot;
&gt; the later sometimes called knowing how.

&gt; Distinguishing knowing that from knowing how

&gt; ...in epistemology in general, the kind of knowledge usually discussed
&gt; is propositional knowledge, also known as &quot;knowledge-that&quot; as opposed
&gt; to &quot;know-how&quot;.

&gt; To exemplify the distinction: in mathematics, there is knowing that 2
&gt; + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to count to 4. Or, one knows
&gt; how to ride a bicycle and one knows that a bicycle has two wheels.

&gt; The distinction is between theoretical reason and practical reason,
&gt; with epistemology being interested in knowledge of the theoretical
&gt; kind, not the practical kind.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

&gt; The distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge has
&gt; sometimes been expressed in terms of knowing-how and knowing-that,
&gt; respectively, or in terms of a corresponding distinction between
&gt; embodied knowledge and theoretical knowledge.

&gt; ...[K]nowing-how or embodied knowledge is characteristic of the
&gt; expert, who acts, makes judgments, and so forth without explicitly
&gt; reflecting on the principles or rules involved. The expert works
&gt; without having a theory of his or her work; he or she just performs
&gt; skillfully without deliberation or focused attention.

&gt; ...Knowing-that, by contrast, involves consciously accessible
&gt; knowledge that can be articulated and is characteristic of the person
&gt; learning a skill through explicit instruction, recitation of rules,
&gt; attention to his or her movements, etc. While such declarative
&gt; knowledge may be needed for the acquisition of skills, the argument
&gt; goes, it no longer becomes necessary for the practice of those skills
&gt; once the novice becomes an expert in exercising them, and indeed it
&gt; does seem to be the case that, as Polanyi argued, when we acquire a
&gt; skill, we acquire a corresponding understanding that defies
&gt; articulation...

&gt; http://artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/MindDict/tacitknowledge.html

&gt; One of the basic distinctions in epistemology ...is the distinction
&gt; between knowing that and knowing how. These are very different kinds
&gt; of knowing...

&gt;  Knowing that is a relationship
&gt;  between a person and a proposition;

&gt; this is the kind of knowing that has to do with content. So, for
&gt; example, we can know that a string is a null-terminated array of
&gt; characters in most C programs, but is an object in Java; we know that
&gt; Bush is president (not all knowledge makes one happy) or that Pedro
&gt; Martinez pitches for the Boston Red Sox. There is a lot of education
&gt; that is centered around expanding the set of things that we know that;
&gt; it is certainly the kind of thing that we are used to testing.

&gt;  Knowing how is a different sort
&gt;  of thing; it is the kind of
&gt;  knowing that has to do with doing.

&gt; We know (most of us) how to walk; this doesn't require that we learn
&gt; the truth of a set of propositions. There are people who know the
&gt; physics of the way a baseball spinning interacts with the air to
&gt; change the nature of it's flight; this is a knowing that but is very
&gt; different than knowing how to throw a curve ball. In at least this
&gt; last case, society tends to reward those who know how more richly than
&gt; those who know that. But such is not always the case. We all know how
&gt; to do many things (healing a cut, recognize visual patterns) for which
&gt; there is hardly any knowing that.

&gt; The two kinds of knowing are entwined in interesting ways, especially
&gt; when it comes to education. When learning a new language, we begin by
&gt; accumulating vocabulary, grammar rules, and idioms (all instances of
&gt; knowing that) until, at some magic point, we know how to speak the
&gt; language. I have been told by a number of lawyers that the point of
&gt; law school is to get people to learn to think like lawyers; this is a
&gt; knowing how (and, perhaps, some violation of natural law).

&gt; Another way of viewing this distinction is by contrasting the content
&gt; of a field with the technique needed to be a practitioner in the
&gt; field. Some fields (history, physics) have lots and lots of content
&gt; that needs to be learned; others (law, mathematics, art, analytic
&gt; philosophy) are almost all technique. Just as there are different ways
&gt; of knowing, there are different ways of learning. To become an expert,
&gt; you need to learn the content of your field (the learning that) but
&gt; you also need to learn the techniques of your field (the learning
&gt; how).

&gt; http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=10522

&gt; In normal conversation we use knowledge to mean:

&gt; Knowing that (facts and information)

&gt; Knowing how (the ability to do something)

&gt; Sometimes, we use the word knowledge to mean that we have some
&gt; information, we know that Mary drinks lemonade, for example. When we
&gt; have this type of knowledge then we are able to express it. I cannot
&gt; say that I know when the Battle of Hastings took place, if I cannot,
&gt; under any circumstances, say the date! This is not true of knowing
&gt; how.

&gt; If I know how to swim, then when placed in the water I make certain
&gt; movements and do not sink! However, I may be unable to say how,
&gt; exactly, I am able to swim. Knowing how does not mean I know that ...
&gt; If I cannot say the date of the Battle of Hastings, I cannot be said
&gt; to know it. But if, while swimming, I cannot tell you exactly how I do
&gt; it, you cannot say I don't know how to swim!

&gt; Failing to understand the above can lead us into certain fallacies. If
&gt; we get instruction from the best public speaker  in the world, it does
&gt; not mean that because he or she can speak excellently, that they know
&gt; how to instruct others. They might be able to say what they do. For
&gt; example they might say how they practice. But this might work for them
&gt; and not for others! A much less able public speaker, or even one who
&gt; might never have spoken in public might be a much better teacher. The
&gt; point is that knowing that and knowing how are two different kinds of
&gt; knowledge!

&gt; In philosophy, knowing that something is the case implies that what is
&gt; known is true. Can we sensibly say that someone knows something, but
&gt; it isn't true? We cannot know that something is the case unless we are
&gt; able to show that it is also true.

'Knowing that', and 'knowing as' - in the former case we see what we
see, in the latter case we name what we see. So the distinction is
between no knowledge and knowledge, for what is named is knowledge in
the public domain, and what is not named is not knowledge at all. In
other words, there is no 'knowing that'.

Yes, you can't see colour without sight. But then, and this is the

Translated:

John has an idea (he's been thinking -- NOT) that he has no idea on
how to express his ideas through language because he reckons he
doesn't and cant do that, but notice how he keeps trying to express
some of his ideas (his thinking -- NOT), through language.

As for the bizarre analogy re sight colors and seeing, what arbitrary

Since when is &quot;sight&quot; defined by seing colour? If you could only see

You are just playing with words here
You are also just plain wrong.
The means by which I present my ideas is language is more correct than
saying the presentation of ideas is language. The presentation of
ideas can be in an entirely non-linguistic format such as graphs,
mathematics, non-verbal music or art, so they are not equivalent.

To summarise -
The means by which I present my ideas is language can be true SOME of
the time (if the means is NOT music, art etc).
The presentation of ideas is language is true NONE of the time. It is
always wrong.

The means by which I construct a building is by using a crane, does
NOT mean that construction of a building is using a crane.

">

That happens every time, when you try to use one sense to two or more
senses of a word. Equivicator, since your using the same word at
various points in your argument and at different times use different
meanings for the same word. These distinctions between how and as are
stipulated and entitled, your equivication is judge out of line here.

Fallacy of four terms

The fallacy of four terms (Latin: quaternio terminorum) is the logical
fallacy that occurs when a categorical syllogism has four terms.

Valid categorical syllogisms always have three terms:

Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All goldfish have fins.

Here, the three terms are: &quot;goldfish,&quot; &quot;fish,&quot; and &quot;fins.&quot;

Using four terms invalidates the syllogism:

Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All humans have fins.

The premises don't connect &quot;humans&quot; with &quot;fins&quot;, so the reasoning is
invalid. Notice that there are four terms: &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;fins&quot;, &quot;goldfish&quot;
and &quot;humans&quot;. Two premises aren't enough to connect four different
terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term
common to both premises.

In everyday reasoning, the fallacy of four terms occurs most
frequently by equivocation: using the same word or phrase but with a
different meaning each time, creating a fourth term even though only
three distinct words are used:

Major premise: Nothing is better
than complete happiness.
Minor premise: A ham sandwich is
better than nothing.
Conclusion: A ham sandwich is better
than complete happiness.

The fallacy of four terms is a syllogistic fallacy. Types of syllogism
to which it applies include statistical syllogism, hypothetical
syllogism and categorical syllogism, all of which must have exactly
three terms.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms
http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/four_fall.html

Equivocation is a logical fallacy. It is committed when someone uses
the same word in different meanings in an argument, implying that the
word means the same each time around.

For example:

1. A feather is light.
2. What is light cannot be dark.

Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

The above argument commits this fallacy: The word &quot;light&quot; is used in
the sense of &quot;having little weight&quot; the first time, but of &quot;bright&quot;
the second time. This fallacy becomes obvious as soon as one tries to
translate this argument into another language. Since the middle term
in this syllogism is actually two different terms, equivocation is
actually a kind of the fallacy of four terms.

The fallacy of equivocation is often used with words that have a
strong emotional content and many meanings. These meanings often
coincide within proper context, but the fallacious arguer does a
semantic shift, slowly changing the context as they go in such a way
to achieve equivocation by equating distinct meanings of the word.

In English language, one equivocation is with the word &quot;man&quot;, which
can mean both &quot;member of species Homo sapiens&quot; and &quot;male member of
species Homo sapiens&quot;. A well-known equivocation is

&quot;Do women need to worry about man-eating sharks?&quot;
where &quot;man-eating&quot; is taken as &quot;devouring only male human beings&quot;.

A separate case of equivocation is metaphor:

1. A Jackass is a male member
of the species Equus asinus
2. All Jackasses have long ears
3. Karl is a jackass

Therefore, Karl has long ears

Here the equivocation is the metaphorical use of &quot;jackass&quot; to imply a
stupid or obnoxious person instead of a male ass.

Equivocation is closely linked with the fallacy of amphiboly.

In contemporary epistemology, there are divisions of knowing, knowing
by sensation and knowing as abstraction. This is the concensus
currently and you don't provide a good enough justification to deviate

A theory about a theory about a theory about a theory about no thing

Nope, senses are the faculty kicked into gear by sensing existence
outside of the brain.

Man (mystics and Kantians excluded of course) look out of his head -
and not into his head - for the origin of his knowledge.

Existence (what the eyes see, the nose smells, the ears hear, the
hands touch, the skin feels) is to the brain what food is to the body,
the brain feeding on itself is the retard chewing its hands off.

They (eyes ears nose hands skin) send messages to the brain however,
what you're saying is, you are blind because you have eyes, deaf

You are saying your brain tells your eyes and ears they haven't seen
and haven't heard what they are seeing and hearing until the brain

Abstractions happen in the brain, but they can not happen UNTIL the
senses have sensed, until the retina has been disturbed, until the ear
drums have vibrated.

Nope, sorry about that, your wrong or your theory is very weak
compared to the contemporary science you should know about before
stepping deep into the realm of current philisophizing.

The brain sends more signals to the eye than it recieves and these
neurons exclusively turn off particular light sensors in the eye so
that the impulses from other sensors can make it back to the brain. In
the processing cycle the state of the eye is already altered to
recieve tainted information, what we are focused on. You really should
read up on whats going on in neuroscience if you want to talk about
the subjects you do.

Lateral inhibition is a mechanism by which neurons are able to
determine more precisely the origin of a stimulus.

When, for instance, the skin is touched by an object, several sensory
neurons in the skin next to one another are stimulated. To determine
more exactly the origin of the stimulus, neurons that are stimulated
suppress the stimulation of neighbouring neurons. The amount of
inhibition is greater when its own stimulation is more powerful. By
doing so only the neurons that are stimulated the most will fire.

These neurons are more in the center of the stimulus, while the
suppressed neurons lie sidewards. hence, lateral inhibition.

Lateral inhibition can be compared with increasing the contrast in
images.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_inhibition

An interneuron (also called relay neuron,association neuron or bipolar
neuron) is a neuron that communicates only to other neurons.

One example of interneurons are inhibitory interneurons in the
neocortex which selectively inhibit sections of the thalamus based on
synaptic input both from other parts of the neocortex and from the
thalamus itself. This is theorized to help focus higher attention on
relevant sensory input and help block out irrelevant or boring input,
such as the sensation of the backs of your thighs on a chair. A human
brain contains about 100 billion interneurons.

Contrast to sensory neurons or motor neurons, which respectively
provide input from and output to the rest of the body.

Interneurons are the neurons that provide connections between sensory
and motor neurons, as well as between themselves. The neurons of the
central nervous system, including the brain, are all interneurons.

Most neurons are collected into &quot;packages&quot; of one sort or another,
often visible to the naked eye. A clump of neuron cell bodies, for
example, is called a ganglion (plural: ganglia) or a nucleus (plural:
nuclei). A fiber made up of many axons is called a nerve. In the brain
and spinal cord, areas that are mostly axons are called white matter,
and it is possible to differentiate pathways or tracts of these axons.
Areas that include large number of cell bodies are called gray
matter.

The term interneurons is also used for the general group of small,
locally projecting neurons of the central nervous system. These
neurons are typically inhibitory, and use the neurotransmitter GABA.

In some feedback systems the static explaination is updated by
accumulated results of prior trials and errors. It changes constantly
but must converge upon this notion of stability never observed by
humans before. Stable enough to -appear- unchanging. The rules don't
have to be fixed but coherently approximated in a constant fasion.

I am trying to find out what to call it when one front leg bumps into
the stair and all legs stop, front leg lifts, other legs push
forwards. The hidden part is the lack of iterations for observation
and if you could add them math wise you could overscale but find the
&quot;colateral inhibition&quot; which is somehow similar to &quot;contravarience&quot;
you mention occasionally. I guess I am still stuck with JZ Youngs 1978
saying, &quot;collateral inhibition&quot; from the book Programs of the Brain.
In that book many collateralisms are displayed but seemingly now
forgotten.

When we are hungry and set down at the table to eat, researchers can
show how one side of a dialectical nerve complex is active. As you get
part way through the meal the other side of the complex begins to
become active. The more active one side the more that side turns off
the other side.

And like musical compositions in particular scales and keys and tempo,
we could add the iterations because the entire object set is a bunch
of vibrations in various length and frequencies. This way the pattern
is the object and the object is a tune called walking.

Actually this colateral inhibition is likely to change everything once
the researchers get back on the right track. It's like the brain is a
multifacited hierarchy of Hegalien dialectics; litterally in physical
structure. These can tecelate into larger physical dialectics. This is
the key in Neurophisiology of the signifigance of Aristotle's Golden
Mean. These spectrums are scatteres everywhere in the brain like
interactive thermostats or more like regularities and give and take
between statistical feilds of activity.

Try and imagine flexing all your mucles at once, it would be hard to
move, walk, talk, or do about anything. So at least some muscles are
relaxed when we perform a complex movement pattern. There is evidence
that the brain actually turns off the ability for differing muscles to
flex during different portions of movement sequences or the movement
smoothness would be interfered with. Most are off at any one time
during complex sequences like dance and some drawn out sequences can
slow the brain cycles allowing enhanced concentration. Some say that
tai chi is a form of meditation that alters brain activities and
results from extreme concentration on movement sequences.

It is like the regions on the brain that send final signal to muscles
are like a piano keyboard with complex movement sequence being played
in chord like progressions. This keyboard would be a little different
though, there would be three positions for each key instead of two. A
pianist pushes a key down but the other keys are not depressed by
default so dont make sounds. On the somatic cortex (keyboard that
plays the muscles) each key has to be not only depressed to flex the
muscle but descending fibers must send signals that stop the other
keys for unflexed muscles from sending signals to their appropriate
muscles.

There is evidence that our eyes even work like this. There are fibers
that send signals back to all the parts that send signals to the
brain. Back and forth trafic of fibers and signal here. The theory is
that these descending fibers turn off noise so valubal information
patterns can make it to the brain. They help tune in and can lead to
seeing patterns more readily from partial data by &quot;bringing forth&quot;
patterns along with sensory data to test theories cooking higher up.

So likewise when they say we only use ten percent of our brain maybe
thats the way it must work, most of it turned off so the needed parts
can spin their patterns or move their mirrors more precisely. back in
the 70's i learned about this colateral excitation and inhibition,
when one group of nerve cells is stimulated they turn down the
activity of those around them and at other places in the brain. I
personally believe that the collateral inhibition and excitation will
emerge as a dominant explanitory theory of brain activity.

Programs of the brain.

Oh so you're confessing the brain does recieve signals from the eyes,
good for Mortal.

But tell us Mortal, those &quot;signals&quot; which you claim the brain sends to
the eyes, where did they originate from, the ears? the nose perhaps?

Why would the brain sends signals to the eyes originating from the
ears, what sort of signals are they? How do you know this?

Can you post a link to a scietific web page on the net which explains
HOW the eyes get these signals from the brain, which YOU speak of,
BEFORE the eyes have sent the signal to the brain to trigger the brain
to do ANYTHING regarding sight?

What triggers' these signals, which YOU claim the brain sends to the
eyes Mortal?

I am saying, the eyes of the person born blind does not send ANY
signals from the disturbed retina in the back of the eye e.g. to
light, to the brain and therefore I am saying the brain has no
information on which it can build ANY signals regarding sight to send
anywhere, let alone back to the eyes.

Whereas it seems you are implying that a brain is capable of sending
signals, originating presumably from vibrating ear drums, to eyes that
have never seen and never can.

This is an incredible discovery or accusation you have made Mortal,
have you run this idea, or dream or nightmare past any recognized
scientific or medical body of human beings?

The fact is, the brain FIRST must get a signal from the disturbed
light sensitive retina and that is all I have ever said.

Actually thats not quite true since most of the brain is always
active, including the places where perception turns into sense data.
Plus these areas of the brain have much stimulation before birth. The
brain has to get itself going well before it can become influenced by
the environment. During pregnency there is much environmental
stimulation but the stimulation I am speaking of comes from the brain
making the nerve cells grow to their location and being tuned to
function properly. Plus in some areas the normal function takes place
even if there is nothing encountered from the environment, these are
called default wirings.

I consider myself an agnostic not a theist. But in fact there are more
nerve cells going to the eye than from the eye and much is turned off
so that attention can more easily be focused upon what comes through.

As for your &quot;theories about theories about theories&quot; this is really
about the regress of justification.

The Regress Argument (also known as The Problem of Criterion and the
diallelus) is a problem in epistemology and, in general, a problem in
any situation where a statement has to be justified. According to this
argument, any proposition requires a justification. However, any
justification itself requires support, since nothing is true &quot;just
because&quot;. This means that any proposition whatsoever can be endlessly
questioned, like a child who asks &quot;why?&quot; over and over again.

Mortal's silly and uncertain accusation (ask him how certain he is) is

sends signals to the eyes, which is based upon the dopey Kantian

I am asking what purpose does his eyes have? And you'll note, he

I am making the simple and absolutely uncomplictaed point of factual
reality, that no matter how complicated you believe the mind works, it
doesn't, it cant even begin to work until it has been &quot;fed&quot; by data
from the senses.

If you want your mind to be the begining of your knowledge of the
