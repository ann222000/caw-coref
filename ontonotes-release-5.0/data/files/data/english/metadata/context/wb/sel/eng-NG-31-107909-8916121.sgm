Ive busted similar chops, I just offer to race them for pink slips but I
get to pick the road--or lack thereof.

Never actually done the lot block... well ok, only a couple times, but
it sure is tempting to take a few short cuts from a few of those darn
parking lots with only one outlet but with a freeway on ramp just across
the grass and up the hill a bit.

Is that supposed to be humourous, or simply another stupid racist remark?

I remember you tried to tell a joke about a year and a half ago, and it
fell as flat as you usually do after alcochemosexual binging.

Trvth is, Goatman, most Japanese cars could eat your entire garage full of
junkers and beaters, and then blow them across 3 states, and you /know/ it.

A 1.9 litre Honda Civic vs. your Turkeybird any day, and any Mazda on the
planet vs. your pathetic little rubberband dragster any evening. They'd
laugh you right off the show &quot;Pinks.&quot; But they'd probably give you a
&quot;Pynx&quot; T-Shit.

No, that was not a typo.

Do they have a 1.8 over there?  The largest I'm aware of is 1.7, but
that could be because what is a Civic over there is something else over
here.

Not that anyone will read this thread much longer now that beavis and
butthead have chimed in.

Hi Lon,

Yes, the Type S has a 1.8
However, they do a faster Type R with a 2 litre 201PS. Does 0-62 in 6.6
seconds.

cross posts to other perverts to no one's surprise. With extreme jealous
ranting over my documents, possessions, successes, manliness and fine,
Southern California surfing body, beard, and loving Christian family.
Committing forgery over many of my posts, proving I'm a responsible American
man. You remind me of a little rat dog, like a Mexican Chiwawa with its
senseless barking, me too, me too. You're even more senile than I first
thought. And the poor thing, you're too girlie to take responsibility for
yourself again, by signing your statement like a man.
That really thinks the group's members are so stupid not to know it's

Exceptionally clever response, Bill. Well done.

And I glad to see that for once you let those trvths glide by without
comment. If anything says that you in fact agree with my statements, that
is it.

Did you have maybe more successes with Soap-Box?

I thought this traitor's attacks were just over personal disagreements,
but in reality these attacks stemming from my love of God and America on
Independents Week, I realized you are actually attacking my country, and
that's what you've been doing all along is declaring your hatred for the
United States of America, with each declaration of my signature, but just
too cowardly and stupid to be a terrorist. It's America, love it, or leave
it, so keep the f*ck out!
Or let me know when you cross my American border, so I may arrest you!
YOU ARE A TRAITOR and lost all rights to my American border, and
someday I'll have you in jail where you belong! Any time, I'll fly and meant
with other patriots guarding our borders against vermin like you.

you, aka SW really is!!!!!
Why don't you call the San Diego Sheriffs Department at 858-974-2020
YOU NEED HELP!
The moral majority say you are not only faggots, but cowards
You wouldn't know about business as you have never succeeded and
anything.
Tell me when you are about to cross my American border and I'll fly up
and arrange at meeting with the U.S. Border patrol and Minutemen for your
arrest, after you give me your name, address, date, and meeting place.
I would appreciate the name and address of these trolls, Square Wheel:

&gt; Exceptionally clever response, Bill. Well done.

&gt; And I glad to see that for once you let those trvths glide by without
&gt; comment. If anything says that you in fact agree with my statements, that

&gt; Did you have maybe more successes with Soap-Box?

Thanks much for the non-reply, Bill, though your Pastry really does answer
more than you may think.

In this case, you have not only admitted that you own a pile of POS
pseudocars, but evidently couldn't even cut it in Soap-Box Derbies, even
with Daddy-Bear's help by building the whole bloody thing FOR you.

SO:

Drag Racer:     Failed
Road Racer:     Failed
Street Racer:   Failed
Hi-Po Mechanic: Failed
Jeeper:         &lt;insufficient data&gt;
Gas Pumper:     &lt;insufficient data&gt;
Window Washer:  Fair
Spud Peeler:    Fair
Human Being:    Failed

It's no wonder we are all so jealous of you, Bill.

So much we have to lower ourselves to.
