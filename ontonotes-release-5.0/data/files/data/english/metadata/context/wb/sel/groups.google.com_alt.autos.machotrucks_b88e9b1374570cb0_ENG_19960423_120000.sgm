I am looking for the communication protocol (hardware &amp; software) for a
PC to talk (and listen) to a GM Engine Computer. Does anyone have that?

I do NOT want to modify the Engine's program.

If not, any idea would be welcome! I am desperate! I'll take anything!

"/> Most newer GMs are 8192 baud 8/N/1. Output is a UART. If you want to
hook up a PC serial port you need to convert to RS232. you can use
one pin on the parallell port also but you need special SW to do it.

Also, if you want to use the serial port you also need bus arbitration.
Rx and Tx is on a single wire from the PCM.

Have fun.

The last time I visited Sears (&amp; Roebuck), they were selling a hand-held
display that plugs into the diagnostic port and displays the service

I can tell you a little bit. I have a '93 Z28 and it will start talking
back if you send 5 numbers then wait. They are 244, 87, 1, 0, 180.
Everything is the opposite of a serial port. A 1 is 5 volts and 0 is 0
volts. When it is not doing anything it stays at 5 volts. Baud rate is
8192. A PC can be programmed to 8228 which is close enough as long as you
invert the signals.

The best thing to use is a Basic Stamp II, a $49 mini computer sold by
Parallax. It can be programmed to any baud rate as well as inverted or
non-inverted polarity. I used one to figure out what the Diacom was
sending to the car. The signal is 50 bits long and takes 6 milliseconds.
If nothing answers it does it four times per second.

Here is the actual pulse train (it starts off at 5 volts)
00010111110111010101010000000100000000010001011011

Good luck. You will definitely need it.

SnapOn sells a product called a ScanGraphics. It comes with a little hardware box that plugs
into your car's ecm on one end, and it has an rs232 port on the other end. It comes with
software for a pc, and I bet you build your own tsr that intercepts all communication between the
serial port and the application.

running lights is as simple as pulling a wire on the emergency brake
switch. Even pushing the emergency brake down one click will turn them
off.

Where are the door mount belt? Waiting for DRL to join, hopefully.

By the way, I need some police searching lights to put arround my
car when I drive to Canada. Government there believe people need
to have DRL to avoid accident. I'll follow their rule there; however,
with those GM DRL setup on their high beam, I need the cop search
lights in order not to be out powered. I also need that in every direction
some car might be hitting me - that is front, side and rear. I can do
away with under and above. I WILL put emphasis in the back - I fear
for the rear-end impact the most. Those who thinks DRL is the greatest
thing and stand strong saying it is must, don't complaint when following
me. According to your theory, I am afraid that you can't see me under
the bright day light.

I don't think light is a problem; however, I see way too many examples
people don't see.

When the 55mph were golden rules, I took every chance doing 55mph in
front of cop without aggrovating them. Just wait, if DRL go in effect
as yet another silly law. I'm gona install those lights behind my rear.

Comes in really handy to take car of those tailgater in the night.

Unfortunately, daytime running lights will probably be federally mandated equipment
for all new cars in the next few years. (I'm pretty sure that the law in on the
books for compliance within the next few years). The automakers just don't decide
that they are going to arbitrarily add safety equipment to cars-why would they want
to drive the cost up. Canada already has a mandatory daytime running lights law.

I can't say that that car car with its lights on during the day is a pretty site.
But as a previous motorcycle rider, I always had my headlight on (of course it has
manadatory equipment for M/C for many years). The point is that you are more
visible to other people when you have headlights on during the day. Just thick
about that when someone pulls out in front of you in your new car.

Besides, what's the problem when you are in your car driving? You don't see the
lights. Are you really that self conscious about your image in your car?

Bottom line is don't get mad at GM, they are just trying to prepare for what will
become law in a year or two. Its that or they don't get to make cars for the US.

I work for a large transportation company, that had problems with DRL's.
All new equipment had them. It is a courtesy to flash your lights when
another truck passes you. We had many trucks almost run off the road, so
the company, with approval of it's drivers disconnected all the day time
running lights.

The glow plugs take a lot of power before you hit the starter. I don't

I recently had my alternator go out in the middle of the mountains of
Virginia on a Sunday. It was raining and at the time I had my lights
and wipers on. To extend the life of the battery until I could get to
civalization, I turned off my headlights. You may argue that this was a
dangerous thing to do, but I believe is was safer than walking along an
interstate highway in the rain. With all due respect to GM, I prefer
to make my own decisions about when it's appropriate to turn on my
headlights.

Hey Y'all,

If you don't like your DRL's so much, you can yank a fuse and forget
about it. Nevertheless, I like the DRL's on my 96 Beretta. They really
help when driving during overcast conditions, rain, twilight, and
heavily wooded areas when oncoming cars are camouflaged with their
surroundings. Cars with DRL's are much more visible in those conditions.
My Beretta also has a sensor in the dashboard which automatically turns
on all the lights (main headlights, tail lights, dashboard lights) when
it senses darkness.

You're right, of course. But I don't set the &quot;parking brake&quot; on my PU
under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances. I was raised in a part of the country
where setting the parking brake during the winter was an invatation to
&quot;frozen up&quot;, so didn't get in the habit. I'm too old now to learn new
tricks. :-)

The other comment about the DRL's being reduced wattage is one of the
things that didn't compute right on my truck. According to the
literature, they are supposed to be 40% of dim (or some such thing). As
near as I can tell, they are simply the &quot;low-beam&quot; headlights. Didn't
use a light meter, just my eyeballs. I can sure tell the difference in
low vs high, and these seemed about the same as low-beam.

Regarding there helping when its drizzly: the front end is not what I
worry about hitting, it's the back end of these idiots that are just
about stopped in the fog/drizzle with nothing on. Many of the new cars
have such small wattage tail lights that they can't be seen, whethere
they're on or not. There should be a mandated range of wattages for tail
lights. (The real bright ones are a bother, also. Can't tell the
difference between tail lights and brake lights.)

While I'm ranting about the back end: Have you noticed how many of the
center brake lights are burned out? Nobody seems to replace them. Saw
one of the &quot;string of lights in the spoiler&quot; the other night that had ONE
light working.

&gt;It is more appropriate to compare DRL to the mouse belt, not the

&gt;Where are the door mount belt? Waiting for DRL to join, hopefully.

&gt;By the way, I need some police searching lights to put arround my

&gt;to have DRL to avoid accident. I'll follow their rule there; however,
&gt;with those GM DRL setup on their high beam, I need the cop search

direction
&gt;some car might be hitting me - that is front, side and rear. I can do

&gt;I don't think light is a problem; however, I see way too many examples

&gt;When the 55mph were golden rules, I took every chance doing 55mph in

If you can't see other cars in broad daylight without them having to turn their

Many cars use what seem to be high intensity running lights rather than
the headlights, so that cars with flip-up lights retain their good looks
during the day. Others use either the low or high beams at reduced power
and intensity. Yes, they do help visibility and improve safety, they
completely eliminate the problem of half-witted people who forget to turn
on their lights when it gets dark or is raining, and no they don't make
the lights burn out faster (at least enough to cause me to notice, and
I've been running DRL's for years)and no they don't cause oncoming
drivers to be dazzled in any way.

There are NO drawbacks to DRL's and only positive results. I fail to
understand the &quot;arguments&quot; of anyone who thinks they are a bad idea.

Hear, hear! A perfect summary of my feelings on the matter.

It seems to me that all of the posts objecting to the DRL's are about
CHOICE, not the fact that they are available. A simple switch on the
dashboard would keep everybody happy. Those that believe in DRL's could
leave the switch on all the time, those (like me) that want to have
control over when they are on could use the switch accordingly, and those
who hate them could just never turn the switch on.

However, the above is probably too simple a solution.....

I do blame GM, because they are not &quot;preparing&quot; for any coming law, as
there is none coming. GM is only making DRL standard to save a few
pennies on manufacturing variability (same models between U.S. and

Pretty much all of these federally mandated &quot;safety&quot; features are a means
of backwards legislation. Lawmakers are looking to prevent injuries in an
accident, but not preventing the accident to start with. Why not invest
the money in better driver education? Why not invest the money in better
public transportation and make driving licenses the privilege it should
be, not the right it has become? Hell, if all these environmentalists were
smart, we wouldn't even have to worry about freaking emissions testing if
we could lower the number of cars on the roads. Easiest way to do that is
to get rid of the absolute idiots that are out there now -- people who
can't remember to turn on their headlights when other motorists may not be
able to see them as well (dusk, heavy rain/snow, fog); people who stop at
the end of a merge lane; people who talk on the phone, put on makeup, read
the newspaper, etc; people who just plain don't have the SKILLS necessary
to drive on the ROAD. How can they call a test of PARKING skills a DRIVING

&gt;I agree...airbags might have helped. But DRLs? I know I wasn't there,
&gt;but if that stupid 18yr old girl veered into the other lane, somehow I
&gt;don't think running lights would have helped. The driver in the other
&gt;lane, just before impact, would have thought, &quot;Oh ~@&amp;%! An oncoming car!
&gt; but I see it better because it has it's lights on!&quot;&lt;crash&gt;. I mean no
&gt;disrespect, I have had relatives &amp; myself in major accidents, so I know
&gt;its no laughing matter, but do you get my point?

"/>  I just read a little bit through this and thought I would give my two cents
worth. Again, it is unfortunate that people have died in car crashes where
airbags, passive restraint systems, and DRLs *MIGHT* have helped.

About the DRL's... DRLs discribed in the example above, &quot;but I see it better
because it has it's lights on! *CRASH* &quot; doesn't really show you the true impact
that DRL can have on avoiding an accident. Here in So. Cal. there are areas that
require you have your lights on evening during daylight (this was well before DRL
existed). DRLs work best during the rain (when 50% of the people DON'T turn on
their head lights), in foggy/smoggy/dusty conditions, and when driving with the
sun setting or rising behind you. The whole idea is not so you can see
better, but so that other's can see you. *See and be Seen* During the
fog/rain...what do you see first? The car or the headlights??? When
facing the sun (sunset or sunrise) what do you see first, dark objects
or bright objects???

Anyway, I drive 40-50000 miles each year and have encountered
enough people not driving with their headlights on when they should,
people without seat belts, etc. etc... Though each of these safety
devices cannot guarrantee that you can survive a crash, in most cases
its all you have, so use them.

What REALLY gets me steamed are parents that don't put their kids
in CAR SEATS, or CARRY their kids on their laps, while they are
strapped in.

As I came in late on this ... I guess it is about some driving lites that
will be on when you turn the key on.. or so.. Now a street rod builder
that I knew in the early 70's put that into his wiring for his 32.. So
when it started the head lights came on. For a while .. six years or
so.. I thought that was dumb... OH.. his name is Ron Benson. some where
in Ca. I guess, now,.. But as I drove more and more in the Seattle
area, I started keeping my lights on.. both for the '29 street rod...
(1929 Dodge milk truck w/360... in Street Rodder mag. under $2,000
challenge...and as 100,000 miles of trucking.) And on the '35 Buick
(stock) Right now I'm trying to build a BIG lite bar , that will sit
under the doors on the rear of the '29 and use say five to seven haligon
backup lites for a &quot;blinking&quot; breaklight .... over the normal two that I
have. So I have no problem with a law that would make lites stay on
durring daytime.. They really do help.

If you ever question ask a BIKER...

No joke time

I have a 56 Studebaker Golden Hawk, and about three weeks ago I accidentaly
hit the headlight toggle switch with my knee. We were driving around a bit
and at a light I pulled up a long side soem guy and he thought it was neat
that our &quot;new car&quot; came with DRL's. He had no idea it was a 38 year old car
and actually wanted to know if it was German or Swedish. When we said it
was a Studebaker he looked puzzled and asked if that was a German Car
company.

May daughter finally said yes it was a German car company andthey use dto
make covered wagons.

So ......if people don't even know how to tell a 30 year old car from a new
one, how you gonna get them to turn off the DRL's at night?

so many cars move out of my way as when I'm driving her car rather then my
pickup. I did see a 96 Blazer and it looked stupid with the lights turned
on Underneath the Head light covers!!!!!

I think maybe the cops ought to start forcing ppl to turn there lights on
during bad road conditions. Here in Michigan if there is less then 500'
of visibilty we have to have our ligts on. Though this law is never

No, we'd rather have the lights on in broad daylight like a bunch of idiots,
it screams &quot;we're all too stupid to do it ourselves, so the government (or
GM) is doing it for us&quot;. Pretty soon all cars will be covered with
bright yellow bumpers, flashing beacons, impact warning radar, will
steer themselves away from perceived danger, have anti-tailgating speed
correction devices, speed limiters at speeds determined by signals sent
by the gov't on state highways, and the like. Plus, those Saturn DRLs
are damn bright, very annoying. Next, we'll have NRLs for people that
drive at Night with just their DRLs because they're too stupid to
realize thier &quot;real&quot; headlights aren't on. And what about FRLs, for
the Fog - RRLs for the Rain. It really pisses me off, too, that my car
locks it's doors when I put it in gear. If I want to be car-jacked,
I'll be car-jacked dammit - if I want my kid to open the door and
tumble out on the highway, that's my decision to make. And, since it's
a 5-speed, it's not smart enough to UNLOCK them when I park. I'm always
fighting the thing to get out and when I pick people up. And don't get
me started on passive restraints - if I want to hurl my body at 60 MPH
through some blue-tinted, tempered glass, then dammit I want to have

Whew. I needed that.

i understand your point about all the possible and already present
safety features that GM uses or has but take it easy. I admit, DRLs
are kind of stupid, but so what....Do you really think that GM will
have all those silly gadgets on there cars someday? You have to
admit, GM and Ford, as well as Chrysler have all contributed to lives
being saved. Was it 1966 the first year that padded dashes were in
every car? How about seat belts? or even air bags for that
matter..... Let's face it, we are driving around in tin cans that
need all the safety features they can get. Unibody construction means
the end to that safe (feels like a '50 Merc) feeling that we used to
get with cars.

Been following this thread with some interest- just a few thoughts-

1) DRLs do make a vehicle statistically safer to be in.

2) The Saturn's are way too bright and very annoying.

3) Let's work within the confines but be more creative stylistically,
maybe DRLs that are like bright neon trim around the bumper or
two pinpoints behind a blackout grill?

4) The clincher for me is the scenario I find myself in all to frequently:

I work on a busy 4-lane with a common left hand turn lane for both
oncomming and forward traffic. I'll signal for a left turn to my
office complex and get in the turn lane (not too early) when some
bozo from the oncomming lane almost runs right into me by getting
in the turn lane earlier than they should. At that time I wish I
had DRLs like spot lights!

Bottom line, we may not be bozos but why wouldn't we want to guard
against them a little better?

|&gt;
|&gt;&gt; I recently had my alternator go out in the middle of the mountains of
|&gt;&gt; Virginia on a Sunday. It was raining and at the time I had my lights
|&gt;&gt; and wipers on. To extend the life of the battery until I could get to
|&gt;&gt; civalization, I turned off my headlights. You may argue that this was a
|&gt;&gt; dangerous thing to do, but I believe is was safer than walking along an
|&gt;&gt; interstate highway in the rain. With all due respect to GM, I prefer
|&gt;&gt; to make my own decisions about when it's appropriate to turn on my
|&gt;&gt; headlights.
|&gt;
|&gt;
|&gt; there is a difference between your survival in this adverse situation
|&gt; and normal everyday driving conditions. maybe if there were 10 other
|&gt; cars around you, you may have at least turned on your marker lights so
|&gt; that they knew you were there. i am assuming that there were not a lot
|&gt; of cars when you had to turn out your headlights.
|&gt; -rs

Well, I was on an Interstate so oncoming traffic was not really a threat.
If DRLs do any good, I think that it would be in a situation on a two
lane road where someone is trying to pass in the opposite direction. Traffic
was not heavy and I stayed in the right lane behind a semi most of the way.
I figured that if they couldn't see the truck's lights (which are up high),
well, I'm toast anyway.

One thing the military has done is research on camouflage for tanks for when they have to
drive along a hilltop (for example).

It seems that when the tank is silhouetted against the sky (especially when cloudy, but
even when sunny) they were able to make it VERY stealthy by putting lights on it that face
outward from the sides.

It reduced the contrast between the tank and the sky.

&gt;&gt;Fine. In fact, here in Illinois, it is law to put your headlights on in
&gt; the rain.
&gt;&gt;If we all think that is a good idea, than let's start enforcing the law.

&gt;&gt;In our society, we would rather make new laws than enforce the old ones.

&gt; And we pass laws because of 50% of the population that is too stupid to turn
&gt; their headlights on in the fog or rain or at night. I don't need the
&gt; government or GM to protect me from myself. We all have to tool around with
&gt; annoying DRLs because a handful of idiots can't remember to turn their
&gt; lights on in inclement weather. I have no rational reason for it, but I
&gt; find DRLs extremely annoying and am glad that companies are now making kits
&gt; for GM cars to disable them. What's wrong with a relay that turns the
&gt; lights on with the wipers? What about sensors that turn them on at night?
&gt; No, we'd rather have the lights on in broad daylight like a bunch of idiots,
&gt; it screams &quot;we're all too stupid to do it ourselves, so the government (or
&gt; GM) is doing it for us&quot;. Pretty soon all cars will be covered with
&gt; bright yellow bumpers, flashing beacons, impact warning radar, will
&gt; steer themselves away from perceived danger, have anti-tailgating speed
&gt; correction devices, speed limiters at speeds determined by signals sent
&gt; by the gov't on state highways, and the like. Plus, those Saturn DRLs
&gt; are damn bright, very annoying. Next, we'll have NRLs for people that
&gt; drive at Night with just their DRLs because they're too stupid to
&gt; realize thier &quot;real&quot; headlights aren't on. And what about FRLs, for
&gt; the Fog - RRLs for the Rain. It really pisses me off, too, that my car
&gt; locks it's doors when I put it in gear. If I want to be car-jacked,
&gt; I'll be car-jacked dammit - if I want my kid to open the door and
&gt; tumble out on the highway, that's my decision to make. And, since it's
&gt; a 5-speed, it's not smart enough to UNLOCK them when I park. I'm always

don't even begin, by any stretch of the imagination, to serve the
purpose that a brake light does. It is not always apparent that a
vehicle is slowing down or stopped, hence the bright red lights. DRLs
do not indicate a change in speed or ANY other condition that other
drivers need to be aware of, other than the fact that another vehicle
is approaching, which even the stupidest of drivers can easily
determine by simply opening his eyes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I have no rational reason for it, but I find DRLs extremely
annoying...
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;So I've noticed.

"/> Your point?
I'm expressing an opinion. If you're going to press me into applying
rationale to my opinion, then it is thus:

DRLs are a bad idea because they a) serve no purpose b) are a way for
GM to sell more alternators c) are a way for GM to replace even more
parts in the event of a frontal collision d) eliminate the advantage
motorcycles and emergency vehicles currently enjoy (thank you mrvette)
and e) are a marketing ploy by GM to get a bigger share of the
conservative, safety conscious aging baby boomer market who will by
anything if it is even remotely related to safety - whether it's merits
are proven or not.

With regard to points b and c. The auto manufacturers make more money
selling aftermarket replacement parts than they do selling cars in the
first place. Lets see now, lights on all the time - we can sell TONS
more batteries, alternators, and have our technicians gouge the
consumer even more with their labor rates. Have you wondered why your
left-hand inner fender under your hood is clogged with expensive
electronics, cruise control, battery, etc.? It's because a vast
majority of front end collisions are LH hits. We can sell lots of
replacement parts that way, too.

There is no conclusive evidence that DRLs make your car any safer in
the long run. Eventually, they all blend together until the gov't or
some marketing department decides that something has to be done so that
cars will stand out from each other better. Then, they will eliminate
DRLs, and cars without lights will be in the minority and therefore be
easier to spot.

Thanks for your input,
Jim

Good point, as a driver in Canada where DRL's are the law on all cars 1990 and

don't know what the answer is but, I do know my running lights on my Explorer

without. Unlike seatbelts, air bags, and padded dashboards, the DRLs
are strictly for people too stupid to turn their lights on when their
supposed to, it's just plain annoying. Accidents happen, and
seatbelts, air bags, and padded dashes all help the occupants survive
in the event of a collision. DRLs just shatter on impact. It's been
argued that DRLs prevent collisions, but there are facts that say they
don't - you can get firm documentation to support either side. So who
knows. I just find them annoying. I was being sarcastic with the
passive restraints and automatic door locks. I've always been a gadget
freak, I like toys, but there's a point where I find them instrusive.
I can reach down to my left, really, and grasp the belt and pull it
across my body and buckle it in place. I'm sorry that some people
would rather be impaled on their steering columns, don't punish me for
it. I can lock my own doors if I feel my child is going to open it
while the car is moving, otherwise, I prefer the &quot;luxury&quot; of exiting my
vehicle at will without finding the &quot;unlock&quot; button. I was seriously
considering the purchase/lease of a GM car, but because of those DRLs,
GM isn't going to get another dime from me. I think GM is shooting
themselves in the foot with them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That's a stretch, my friend. And turn signals because people forget to
&gt;make hand signals, too. Har deeeeeeee har har. I don't mind having
&gt;bright red lights on the back of my car if it means I don't have to
&gt;stick my hand out the window everytime I'm going to slow down. DRLs
&gt;don't even begin, by any stretch of the imagination, to serve the
&gt;purpose that a brake light does. It is not always apparent that a
&gt;vehicle is slowing down or stopped, hence the bright red lights. DRLs
&gt;do not indicate a change in speed or ANY other condition that other
&gt;drivers need to be aware of, other than the fact that another vehicle
&gt;is approaching, which even the stupidest of drivers can easily
&gt;determine by simply opening his eyes.
&gt;I'm expressing an opinion. If you're going to press me into applying
&gt;rationale to my opinion, then it is thus:
&gt;DRLs are a bad idea because they a) serve no purpose b) are a way for
&gt;GM to sell more alternators c) are a way for GM to replace even more
&gt;parts in the event of a frontal collision d) eliminate the advantage
&gt;motorcycles and emergency vehicles currently enjoy (thank you mrvette)
&gt;and e) are a marketing ploy by GM to get a bigger share of the
&gt;conservative, safety conscious aging baby boomer market who will by
&gt;anything if it is even remotely related to safety - whether it's merits
&gt;are proven or not.
&gt;With regard to points b and c. The auto manufacturers make more money
&gt;selling aftermarket replacement parts than they do selling cars in the
&gt;first place. Lets see now, lights on all the time - we can sell TONS
&gt;more batteries, alternators, and have our technicians gouge the
&gt;consumer even more with their labor rates. Have you wondered why your
&gt;left-hand inner fender under your hood is clogged with expensive
&gt;electronics, cruise control, battery, etc.? It's because a vast
&gt;majority of front end collisions are LH hits. We can sell lots of
&gt;replacement parts that way, too.
&gt;There is no conclusive evidence that DRLs make your car any safer in
&gt;the long run. Eventually, they all blend together until the gov't or
&gt;some marketing department decides that something has to be done so that
&gt;cars will stand out from each other better. Then, they will eliminate
&gt;DRLs, and cars without lights will be in the minority and therefore be
&gt;easier to spot.
&gt;Thanks for your input,
&gt;Jim

"/> Just my 2 cents...

I am a truckdriver. That means that I make my living by driving around
100,000 miles a year. Need'les to say I have seen a few things in my
days and I thought I'd go ahead and reply reguarding the DRL
situation.

DRL's are helpful. Many times due to glare, weather conditions or even
stupid drivers either forgetting or refusing to turn on headlights,
cars can be extremly hard to see. So there is a good reason for DRL's
and I think it is a good one. As has been mentioned before it is
already standard equiptment in canada and will be federaly mandated
here in the states soon. Car companies are just getting it over with
before they are forced to.

And lets not over look the REAL reason most people that don't like
DRL's, &quot;It's not COOL&quot;. You can't see your lights while driving so the
only reason for you to be upset is because your worried someone will
look at you and not think your cool.

Be safe, use the DRL's and live longer.

Yes, but here are some points I would like you to consider:

o Seat belts are &quot;optional.&quot; By that I mean that you do have to
put it on; it does not simply gets around you without your consent.
Laws apart, only you have the final authority on whether to use it
or not. DLR, on the other hand, is operational whether you like it
or not

o Air bags are fairly nice since they do not bother you with their
existence until they are called into action. In other words, they
are very non-intrusive, which is not the case with DRL

o DRL is aimed at the lowest driver possible. Since he can't be
trained to pay attention at the traffic, we try to make the traffic
a more visible

o You think DRL will make driving safer. I think not. As the average
imbecil putters around, he will become a more dangerous driver since
he will think he can rely on DRL to see an incoming car. So, he
will pass cars in a 2-lane road even when the incoming traffic is too
close. Sometimes the other driver will have time to slow down...

&gt;There are NO drawbacks to DRL's and only positive results. I fail to
&gt;understand the &quot;arguments&quot; of anyone who thinks they are a bad idea.

"/> I agree with Brian on this. I drive an '88 Chev 3/4-ton that is'nt
equipped with DRLs. The first thing I do after starting the engine is
turn on the low beams and I leave 'em on 'til the engine is switched
off (except when I flash a passing transport to let him know that he
can pull in front of me). I've been doing this ever since I got my
license (in '79) and don't see why anyone would NOT want to be more
visible on the road.

Among the whole pile of reasons why it makes sense to be seen is the
fact DRLs make it easier for other drivers to see you and to judge
your distance. This is applicable regardless of the ambient lighting
conditions: in bright sunshine, the DRLs provide a reference point
that cuts through the glare and makes you visible to oncoming traffic
much sooner; needless to say, under overcast or variable conditions,
the DRLs provide a constant source of light that again makes you more
visible.

Obviously, those who oppose the use of DRLs are not familiar with the
need to be able to quickly and accurately judge the distance of
oncoming traffic (or even to see such traffic) when attempting to pass
on a two-lane highway, or when turning onto a rural highway from a
full stop. An even better reason is to see the idiot who's passing
someone else while you're the oncoming traffic. And of course we've
got the road-coloured car (gray, silver, black, white in the winter)
on a shady country road under an overcast sky that is entirely
invisible unless it has DRLs.

defeats the &quot;purpose&quot; (if there is one other than to sell more cars) of
DRLs. Saturns OTOH, are annoyingly bright. Leave it to the US
manufacturers to take a stupid idea and make it worse by creating a
hodge podge of different styles and options. &lt;sigh&gt; I hope they're
selling more cars, because they're really dividing the potential buyers
into DRL and no-DRL camps.

your door

"/> Maybe, but I won't have them. If the gov't does impose such a

disable them. How are they going to enforce it? I'm sure I'll get
pulled over because my DRLs aren't on. I haven't had a front license
plate for 2 years now and the cops aren't observant enough to realize
it's missing. (except for one very observant officer in a local small
town, I must admit - he let me go, though) They certainly aren't going
to notice that my car is a 19XX and has no DRLs. I bet I could pull
that 3rd brakelight off and go through inspection and they wouldn't
even notice. If it's there and not working, that's one thing. But
outta sight, outta mind.

And, the post you responed to, above, isn't mine - though my name is up
there. You did bring up points in my post. When did I say I didn't
like anti-theft ignition? Just curious, maybe I did but I didn't mean
it. Plus &quot;anti-theft&quot; is a loose term, when a thief can pop it in less
than 10 seconds, I hardly call that anti-theft. I simply don't like
being told what to do, or having features forced upon me to &quot;protect&quot;
me from myself or others. If I was afraid of other people on the road,
I wouldn't set foot in a car. Have you ever driven in NJ? What a
mess, I'm sure DRLs will clean it up though. Everyone will suddenly be
conformists and accidents will decrease a zillion percent. I'm not
against seat belts, I just don't like my car to put it on for me. I
can do it myself, thank you - I don't need GM to tell me to buckle up -
I've figured that one out all by myself. My Ford has manual
restraints, no airbags, no DRLs and it doesn't lock and unlock the
doors at random. I think I might keep it longer than I had planned....

&gt; Among the whole pile of reasons why it makes sense to be seen is the

&gt; your distance. This is applicable regardless of the ambient lighting
&gt; conditions: in bright sunshine, the DRLs provide a reference point
&gt; that cuts through the glare and makes you visible to oncoming traffic
&gt; much sooner; needless to say, under overcast or variable conditions,
&gt; the DRLs provide a constant source of light that again makes you more
&gt; visible.

&gt; Obviously, those who oppose the use of DRLs are not familiar with the
&gt; need to be able to quickly and accurately judge the distance of
&gt; oncoming traffic (or even to see such traffic) when attempting to pass
&gt; on a two-lane highway, or when turning onto a rural highway from a
&gt; full stop. An even better reason is to see the idiot who's passing

cases of low visibility, where headlights certainly make sense, like
rain, fog, snow, etc.) then I can't see the car with headlights and I am
blind. Of course, someone can bring up a whole bunch of ambiguous
what-ifs, but the point is,

_headlights are not necessary in the daytime, except __except__ under
conditions of low visiblity._ That's why we have a sun in the sky!

The only problem with that now, is that there are occasional people who
don't even know what constitutes low visibility and never turn their

Another good thing about DRL's - if you're in a funeral procession, you
don't have to turn on your lights. In Sweden, where many aspects of
automobive safety were pioneered, DRL's are mandatory in the form of
headlights or parking lights lit at low intensity.

At least with a helmet, the odds are that any accident that would have

other internal injuries first.... In the long run, the helmet law saves

Aw www...poor  babies. Isn't this cute, everyone whining about
DRL's...whats next? Lest get rid of seat belts and airbags too. Naa,
we don't need ABS...hell, lets just get rid of the brakes. Any REAL
driver should be able to just steer clear of an accident, right?
Being so, lets remove all bumpers and safety cages from all the cars.
Lets get rid of all vehicle lighting too. I can see in the dark
because i'm a REAL driver. Seeing as how we don't have brakes
anymore, we wouldn't need brakelights. Oh yeah and how could I
forget, remove all of the inertia switches for fuel cutoff. Since we
are all super drivers we'd never get in an accident so our electric
fuel pumps would never spray raw feul onto a fire and burn us to a
crisp. And who needs instrumentation? Us REAL car guys don't need a
steenkin' gauge to see how fast we're going, we just know. We can
also tell when we're low on gas, if the oil pressure's gone, engine's
overheating, etc.

Geez think about it....after we remove the braking system, vehicle
lighting, bumpers, airbags, seatbelts, instruments, inertia switches,
safety frames, etc...etc...etc..., we'd have a much cheaper car! Not
to mention faster because of all the weight savings!

&gt; Boy, is this ever true. I actually don't mind the DRL's that much, since I think its great for
&gt;a car to be more visible. But the Saturn DRL's are, for some reason, far more distracting than
&gt;other models. They seem more piercing and bright than the norm, and they never fail to
&gt;bother me on highways. A Saturn SL1 and a new Taurus with DRL's were behind me at a
&gt;stoplight, and the Saturn's lights were MUCH brighter. Anyone else find this to be true?

"/> I agree. I also find the Grand Am's to be bright also. This really seems to
a GM thing of using high beams. It's as if they said &quot;if we use low beams the
bulbs will burn out faster and we will get complaints. Since most people rarely
use the high beams we will use them instead. Who cares if it bothers other drivers
on the highway.&quot; At least we won't get complaints about our bulbs burning out
fast.&quot;

BTW, I alway use my headlights in bad conditions, even though it's pretty
hard to miss my car-fire engine red. I am perfectly capable of turning my
lights on myself. Perhaps if the police would stop trying to raise revenue
with tagging people for going 5 mph over the limit and tag people for
not turning their lights on when they should (i.e. rain, dusk) and fine them
$100 they would get the message.

I'm getting off my soapbox now.

&gt;Have you seen GM's experimental truck in Motor Trend? It employs many
&gt;of these silly gadgets, they're testing them for implemenation. You
&gt;should see this thing. It doesn't have the padding all around it
&gt;though, but it does have a radar collision avoidance system, strobes,

&gt;of time before radar speed enforcement becomes a thing of the past, and
&gt;highways will simply have transmitters that the cars receive to limit
&gt;speeds to the posted limit.

&gt;&gt;admit, GM and Ford, as well as Chrysler have all contributed to lives
&gt;&gt;being saved. Was it 1966 the first year that padded dashes were in
&gt;&gt;every car? How about seat belts? or even air bags for that

&gt;Seatbelts were '66, too.

Here's a thought on DRL's...

I own a &quot;large&quot; car that is a all white, easy to see 92' Corvette, but
because it sits so low to the ground I keep my running lights (fog lamps)
on during the day.
I have found when I pass people, especially older drivers they notice me
alot quicker.

Many vette owners fight the DRL view because they think we will need to
have our unsighlty headlights on all the time but I shure feel safer with
some lights on.

&gt;&gt; While I'm no big fan of GM either, I must point out that this tactic
will
&gt;&gt; only work for a couple more years until DRLs become mandatory
equipment,
&gt;&gt; just like the high-mounted brake light, airbags, etc.

&gt;It is more appropriate to compare DRL to the mouse belt, not the
&gt;air bag. Aigbag was the goal, those cheap manufactures came up with
&gt;mouse belt. The real goal for GM is to build real safe car and here
&gt;DRL let them play the same game they did with the door mount belt.
&gt;Where are the door mount belt? Waiting for DRL to join, hopefully.

&gt;By the way, I need some police searching lights to put arround my
&gt;car when I drive to Canada. Government there believe people need
&gt;to have DRL to avoid accident. I'll follow their rule there; however,
&gt;with those GM DRL setup on their high beam, I need the cop search
&gt;lights in order not to be out powered. I also need that in every
direction
&gt;some car might be hitting me - that is front, side and rear. I can do
&gt;away with under and above. I WILL put emphasis in the back - I fear
&gt;for the rear-end impact the most. Those who thinks DRL is the greatest
&gt;thing and stand strong saying it is must, don't complaint when
following
&gt;me. According to your theory, I am afraid that you can't see me under
&gt;the bright day light.

&gt;I don't think light is a problem; however, I see way too many examples

&gt;When the 55mph were golden rules, I took every chance doing 55mph in

I know it's a rather insignificant point, but the 1/4 mile tracks I've
been to don't allow the drivers to keep their headlights on during the run and
on the return road because it blinds the other drivers. Guess we'll just have

motorized seatbelts, door-mounted belts designed to be left buckled
(nobody does-but it gets GM out of putting airbags in). These are
all done because people don't buckle their belts. None of these work
unless you secure your lapbelt (for motorized belts) or fasten your
seatbelt ( for airbags ) or the worst offender is the door mounted
belts which do squat it the door flies open in an accident. That is
why GM has put automatic power door locks even on the lowly Cavalier

You take a couple of my statements, and then assume I'd rather have a

I think the engineering of some passive restraints and automatic door
locks needs re-thinked, but I don't think they are terrible ideas. I
like power locks, just let me do the locking and unlocking. Let me
fasten my own seatbelt. There are features that are built into cars
that are good ideas, and some that are bad. Some that MAKE cars safer,
some that make its occupants FEEL safer. Why is it that I don't get a
discount on my insurance for my ABS anymore? Because people are
beginning to question its merits. Some things look like a good idea at
one point in time, i.e. DRLs, and later on become a questionable means
of &quot;improving&quot; safety. ABS has proven to give drivers a false sense of
security, and actually making them worse drivers. People are braking
later and driving faster as a result - especially in inclement weather.
Much like the 4-wheel drive syndrome, where 4X4 drivers are involved
in/responsible for most of the traffic accidents in the snow. What's
going to happen when we all have the &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;security&quot; of DRLs?

Please explain this statement-- it makes no sense to me. It is damn near
impossible to judge the distance of a car with lights on, since the lights
are all you see. The image of the headlights is so far behind the car that
any estimate of distance is a guess. In addition, it is extremely difficult
to judge the speed of a vehicle with its lights on, for the same reason.
This makes it more difficult to decide whether to turn left in front of

Remember this when you rear-end some asshole who refuses to turn on his
headlights in foggy conditions, since DRL's don't turn on the tail lights.
Better yet, it will be YOUR fault, since it is always easier to blame someone
else.

Also, don't forget that lights cause glare. And cars will be
indistinguishable from one another in a sea of lights (think of how invisible
motorcycles will become!). And don't forget how you and I won't be able to
judge distances or speeds accurately since headlights make these tasks
difficult.

|&gt; And lets not over look the REAL reason most people that don't like
|&gt; DRL's, &quot;It's not COOL&quot;. You can't see your lights while driving so the
|&gt; only reason for you to be upset is because your worried someone will
|&gt; look at you and not think your cool.

Yeah, like I used to tool around in a yellow 1972 AMC Hornet because all
that mattered to me was being &quot;COOL.&quot;

|&gt; Be safe, use the DRL's and live longer.

Be safe, don't have big brother force band-aid solutions on the fact that
a good 30% of Americans shouldn't have a drivers license.

No, please re-read what I wrote above. How does being mistaken
for a car (the original complaint about car DRLs) make a biker
more vulnerable? The danger to a biker is primarily being mistaken
for *empty space* (&quot;I-didn't-see-him-officer&quot;), not another vehicle.

Nope, I don't. But I don't want to limit that advantage to bikers.
You seem to be falling into the common trap of treating vehicle
visibility as a zero-sum game, where one vehicle can increase its
visibility only at the expense of another vehicle. But that's not
how it works, because most of a driver's field of vision is filled
with *other* (non-vehicle) sights -- the background items I mentioned
above. The fact that motorcycles are successfully operated at night,
when everyone has their lights on and no one has an &quot;advantage&quot; is
another example of this concept.

Any Canadian or Swedish bikers care to comment on how their life
has changed since DRLs were mandated in their countries?

Not necessarily. They would only have to increase. As it is, the
effectiveness of DRL is extremely difficult to prove either way. There are
just too many other factors out there which contribute to accidents.

|&gt; by the way, if it's so tough for you to deal with

No, because most people dim their highbeams (which are aimed into
the eyes of oncoming traffic) at night. GM decided to use highbeams as DRL;
it is annoying as hell.

We have air bags because.... (this applies to severe front end accidents which I believe to be a
majority of bad accidents)

The original type 'manual' seatbelts were &quot;too much trouble&quot; for the average US driver
to use, so the many variations of automatic seatbelts were intorduced.

&quot;They are uncomfortable&quot;
&quot;They wrinkle my clothes&quot;
&quot;I don't want to be trapped after an accident&quot; etc...
There is no replacement for a decent IQ, but I digress...

Another consequence of the fleet fuel mileage requirements was that automobile frames were eliminated.
Now the structural integrity of the vehicle depended on a stamped sheet metal pan instead of a welded
beam structure. Now in frontal collisions these pans break, bend and fail allowing the front section
of the car's body (generally, from the front door posts forward) to move backward into the passenger
compartment. The survivable space that use to exist in real cars no longer existed, so to keep the
passengers from being hit in the face with the front third of the car, air bage were installed.

In modern cars, a seat belt system merely holds the passengers in place as the front of the vehicle
is shoved through their chest. Although air bags help in some of the more moderate to severe accidents,
the most severe accidents leave so little room inside that an air bag is of little consequence.

I worked as a firefighter for 5.5 years and saw many examples of this, and not all were in compact or
sub-comapct cars as you might think. E me if you want me to post some further details on this subject....

DRLs? At whose expense? Motorcyclists. Because American drivers are generally so involved with putting
on their make-up, reading the paper, drinking coffee, changing the CD, or smacking the kids in the back
seat to watch where they are going, autos are now comming equipped with DRLs.

The daytime headlight was one of the few things that motorcyclists had in their favor while trying to avoid
becoming a hood ornament on the next car that happened by. According the the Hurt study:

In the multiple vehicle accidents, the driver of the other vehicle violated the motorcycle right-of-way and
caused the accident in two-thirds of [the accidents studied].

So who wins, who loses? Enough raving for now... Flame away!

Thank you Bert.
Helmets restrict vision and hearing, cause higher risk taking (see &quot;courage
for your head&quot; bell helmet ad) and fatigue. With all of this, you would think
that accident rates would SLIGHTLY rise? hehhe.Statistics say that accident
rates (in cali) have FALLEN!
According to the anti-helmet choice people, they would like you to believe
that helmets REDUCE accidents! Yah, right. All it says to me is that less
people in cali are riding (proven- Look at cycle registration records)
I hope all of you people in california who voted for helmets choke on the
extra smog the cars (that replaced the cycles) produce.

Sure a airbag is better than nothing, in a small lowspeed accident, no

Very, Very true.. You just hit something with me that made me stop and
think (Geez, gotta stop doing that). Been riding a HD for 6 years now, and
we do not have many advantages at all. People will look right at you and
not see you. With this DRL going where is it, how much worse will it be
out there?

The only rule that I rememeber religiously, is something that a friend of
mine told me right before I got my bike. &quot;Just pretend that your
invisable, and that no one sees you&quot;. Best advise I ever got.

Just because a country mandated them and people like them and think they have
value and want to get used to them doesn't make it a good idea.

The bottom line: One should not have a problem seeing a car in broad
daylight (if someone does, they shouldn't hold a license). Therefore, DRL
are at best useless. If they are such a good idea, why don't we take it one
step further, and require all cars to be slime lime or dayglo orange, with
strobe lights on all sides, and sound the horn every two seconds?

DRL's are OK: I recently avoided an accident when a DRL'ed truck suddenly

Sure.

Let's have the federal DOT apply as strict rules for licensing
drivers and maintaining motor vehicles as the FAA does for pilots and
aircraft. Mandate GPS and digitial communication to traffic ground
stations, and file &quot;official drive plans&quot; for all trips over 30 miles.

Add German and Japanese style 'car inspections' as thorough as the
inspection of aircraft turbines. Enforce &quot;pre-drive&quot; official checklist
procedures. Randomized drug testing of drivers. Mandatory retirement from
driving at 65.

Now what would the good people of The Republic of Texas say to that?

People get all hot and bothered when their state tries to have minimal
smog checks every two years.

Anyway, what is the obsession that people have with *Federal* government?
It's a random meme that's been stirred up once again.

In my experience and observation its local and state government which is
more intrusive, less intelligent and far more corrupt than the feds.

If it's just the quantity of taxes, bash the geezers,
they're the ones taking your money.

&gt;Please explain this statement-- it makes no sense to me. It is damn near
&gt;impossible to judge the distance of a car with lights on, since the lights
&gt;are all you see. The image of the headlights is so far behind the car that
&gt;any estimate of distance is a guess. In addition, it is extremely difficult
&gt;to judge the speed of a vehicle with its lights on, for the same reason.
&gt;This makes it more difficult to decide whether to turn left in front of
&gt;someone.

"/> Au contraire. The fact that the headlights are on provides a
consistent reference to the location of the vehicle, especially in
situations in which the ambient lighting may be changing (e.g., when
the approaching vehicle is moving between sunlit and shady areas). If
all you see is the lights, then the car is a good distance away from
you (we're talking daylight driving here, not night) and you've
probably seen him long before you would have otherwise. I'd be
interested in your results from a real-world experiment: go out for a
drive on a high-speed, two lane road during the day; try to guess the
distance and speed of oncoming traffic and see how good your estimate
is for cars with and without headlights on. I guess we're all
different in the way we perceive things because I don't find that the
image of the headlights is behind the vehicle; I find it to be the
best reference point there is. And road safety research bears me out
on this; drivers consistently are better able to judge the whether a
passing manoeuver or entry to a highway is safe based on the distance
of an oncoming vehicle if the oncoming vehicle's headlights are on.
Unfortunately, I don't have a reference to substantiate this since I
threw it out many moons ago, but it's one of the bases upon which the
Canadian and many other countries' DRL laws are based. Anybody out
there work in highway or automotive safety? (BTW, why do you think
trains are required to operate with REALLY bright lights on at all
times?).

&gt;&gt;rather, it decreases it.

&gt;So what? Once again, that error of judgement could happen whether I've

"/> So what? So that shows that DRL are not a panacea for bad judgement.
That was my whole point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;|&gt; This old, tired 'they shouldn't be driving anyway' statement sounds
&gt;&gt;|&gt; good, but the reality is they are out there driving, and we can't
&gt;&gt;|&gt; change that.

&gt;&gt;Sure we could. It is done in other countries.

&gt;We don't live in these other countries. I'd be interested in hearing
&gt;how you, today, could get some of these substandard drivers off the
&gt;road. That's the context for action we're talking about here.

"/> How about this (bear with me, this could be a while). How about
utilizing the state police (or highway patrol, or whatever they are
called in your area) to patrol the highways. I don't mean the
bullshit radar enforcement, where they sit on their asses and wait for
someone to drive by exceeding the underposted, revenue-enhancement
based speed limit. I mean getting out there, ticketing people who
can't keep the car in their lane, those who don't use directional
signals, those who refuse to keep right except to pass. Hell, we pay
enough for these services, yet since it is far easier to sit and wait
for those big, bad speeders to come by and hit them with microwaves
and/or IR, so that is what is done.

Secondly, we could make the driving test a lot more realistic. My
road test (some 15 years ago) took less than 10 minutes-- it consisted
of a left turn, right turn, right turn, 3-point turn, left turn, left
turn, and a right turn (no parallel parking, no traffic lights, no
highway driving). As if that's a real good indicator of my driving
skill. In conjunction with this, we could implement a bit more driver
education, not the standard &quot;speed kills&quot; bullshit and the gory
accident scene films they like to show to scare people. Heck, even
the learner's permit tests are a joke-- my fiancee recently took the
test, and there were at least 3 (out of 20, I think) questions about
drugs and alcohol, despite the fact that there are literally hundreds
of other subjects which are more appropriate for such a test.

Thirdly, we could require interval testing of driving skills. I got
my license at age 17, and haven't had to prove that I still know how
to drive. Literally all I've had to do to prove my fitness to drive
is read the third line of the eye chart when renewing my license.
This is especially significant for senior citizens, who, thanks to the
lobbying power of the AARP, fight against any attempts to regulate
their driving through testing, while statistically, they are the
secondmost likely group to die in auto accidents; worst, if you take
into account miles driven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I don't overestimate their skills at all; in fact, quite the opposite.
&gt;&gt;That makes me a safer driver. Directing lights into my eyes does nothing
&gt;&gt;positive in that respect.
&gt;If you say safety devices are unnecessary because drivers should be
&gt;good enough to not need them, that's overestimation.

"/> I never said that, so please don't put words in my mouth (I can do
that myself just fine, thank you). I have nothing against safety
devices. Air bags, seat belts, side-impact protection: these all
serve a purpose in case of an accident. Most accidents are caused by
driver error; it is unclear that DRL will cause drivers to make less
errors in judgement. I still don't understand why it is so desirable
to see a car that is 4000 feet ahead, as opposed to sighting it at
&quot;only&quot; 3000 feet.

On the other hand, why should we accept that mediocre drivers can and
do cause accidents which cause bodily harm to innocent, safe drivers?
As is typical, the rights of the good drivers are limited by the lack
of skill of the poor drivers. If someone kills another while driving
drunk, it will be a minimum of vehicular manslaughter. If someone
kills another because he or she crossed the double yellow line, the
most you'll see is a ticket for &quot;failure to keep right.&quot;

&gt;agree with your point. Unfortunately reduced-intensity high beams are
&gt;the norm amongst manufacturers rather than the exception.

"/> What is unfortunate is that most cars here in the states with DRL are
GM products. For some reason, they insist on using the highbeams for
DRL on most models. These form the majority of cars with DRL that I

You should clarify the &quot;they&quot; here. The manufacturer has no choice. Our
&quot;betters&quot; in Washington made the decision FOR both the maker of the
vehicles and the folks who buy and drive them. If a switch was offered
for the driver's side you can be sure every ambulance chaser in the world
would be waiting to file the first lawsuit. Hell, these sharks managed to
take Ford to court for not having something they were not required to have
on the car in the first place, on a car the plaintif bought voluntarily.
This was the lack of an airbag in an older model of Escort. Well, my
dad's '47 Hudson didn't either when he got hit head on and got bruised
ribs and a cut face. Wonder if his estate should sue whoever ultimately
got the Hudson assets?

Wait until some of these airbag cars get to be 20 or so years old. What
about the components at this point? Lexus and others can bleat about
their gold-plated contacts and all that crap all they want. What about
the chemicals? Will they still work? Will they be stable? How many of
these things are going to self-deploy? The ATA boys must be drooling at
the prospects.

"/> My 1990 Volvo 240 has a sticker on the driver's side B pillar stating
that the SRS (airbag) must be serviced or replaced by 2000. So, it
appears to me that these things have a 10 year lifespan (at least
Volvo thinks so).

I haven't priced a new airbag, but I am sure that they are not cheap.
I'll bet that many people will not have their aribags replaced at 10
year intervals because the cost may well exceed the value of the
car.

"/> OK, I have the following to say about air bags and other devices.
Please note I have not looked up any statistics.

First off, does anyone notice that automatic seat belts are disappearing
from new cars - meaning car makers are not putting them in? Well the
reason why is that if an individual does not wear the lap belt and only
the shoulder belt is in place there is a rather large chance that the
individual will lose his/her head in an accident. Don't believe me,
just ask any police officer or firefighter.

Next, do or have air bags killed people that might not have died??
Definitely - however, look at how many people lived because of them.
According to a news report I read approx 10,000 people were saved while
~20 were killed by them - Let's figure the math.

Then the question remains - can they be improved?? Of course they can
but lets remember that air bags have only been in wide deployment for a
couple of years - each year they make improvements.

Also, for those with trucks and passenger air bags - be carefull with
child seats - air bags and child seats do not go well together.

belt is not buckled, the air-bag will not deploy. This makes a lot of
sense, and if true, the family of the boy that was killed in NYC may
have a good case against Ford for not employing the same technology.
(it was the passenger side air bag in a Contour that killed the kid)
While I think it's idiotic not to have insisted the kid wear a belt,
and ridiculous to sue Ford for the aforementioned negligence, I'm
afraid that's what society has come down to. Somehow, I'm sure she's
going to blame Ford for the mishap. Ford issued a LONG statement about
their airbags and how they only work with seatbelts. It's also the law
in NYC to wear a belt, but again, I'm sure Ford will be blamed somehow.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned a serious hazard inherent with airbags
that is *not* potential -- it *does* happen, and *very* often (as I'm sure
any firemen/EMTs can attest to ).

Air bags cause BURNS. No, don't laugh, don't automatically hit &quot;R&quot;espond
and tell me I'm full of crap. Read your owner's manual on how the airbag
deploys. It is a *highly* exothermic reaction of sodium azide that causes
the bag to inflate so rapidly. It is *so* hot, in fact, that it can cause
serious burns to the face and hands of the person &quot;protected&quot; by the air
bag.

It also causes concern to the victim of the crash that there is a fire,
especially if they can't get out of the car right away. Imagine -- extreme
heat coming from the dash area (actually just the air bag, but who's going
to think of that right after an accident?) and also the &quot;smoke&quot; in the air
(which is actually a powder that keeps the airbag from sticking together
while it is folded up, so that it inflates properly). In this suit-happy
society, this amounts to &quot;emotionally damaged&quot; people who were traumatized
by thinking they were trapped in a car that was about to burn to a cinder.

Sure, most people would rather be salving their burns, thinking &quot;Man, I'm
glad I'm still alive.&quot; But there are those who are thinking, &quot;If I do get
burned, man, GM (or Ford, or whoever) is going to pay!&quot;

&gt;For all those that think a car manufacturer wouldn't put a potentially

&gt;just basically decapitated by the passenger side air-bag (obviously he
&gt;was killed) in a minor traffic accident. He wasn't &quot;properly
&gt;restrained&quot; - no belt. Just food for thought.

"/> You haven't been following the debate. This is a known consequence
of the crash testing requirement that the passenger dummy must not
be belted in. To meet the damage requirements, the passenger side
air bag has to inflate faster - if the dummy was correctly belted, they
could use much slower inflation rates. The number of children killed
by fast inflating airbags is reported to be around 27 so far ( almost all
unrestrained ), the number saved?.

The whole issue has been under intense debate between the car
manufacturers ( who cite the current 67% use of seatbeats, compared
to the &lt;20% at the time the requirement was mandated ) and the
safety authorites. The current consequence is to be a multi-million
dollar campaign to teach the public how to strap paasengers and
children in, and to encourage greater use of restraints for children,
while the information on crash testing alternatives is assessed..

You might be interested that here in New Zealand, if a parent is
seen with a child under a certain age in a car, and the child is not
properly restrained ( belted in or approved baby seat ), then the

Folks,

This is the truth. Airbags can cause severe burns. I was involved in an
accident seven months ago. My broken bones have since healed. However, I
still have burn scars all up and down my left arm. These burns aren't simply
*friction* burns. They are caused by chemicals usaed to deploy the bag during
impact. In my case, the airbag kept me from suffering a more serious injury.
But they can and do cause burns.

You're overlooking some basic chemistry.

1. The heat generated is absorbed primarily into the nitrogen gas produced.

2. The gas expands. Expansion of a gas cools it.

I've experienced an air bag going on. It was NOT hot. It was bad
smelling however. Took quite a while to get the odor out of the car.

"/> I wish I was, but I wouldn't have posted that if I hadn't seen the proof
of it myself. If the gas was allowed to expand infinitely, yes, it would
cool to the point of no longer being dangerous. But it is contained in the
airbag (at least initially). And reread what I posted. &quot;The reaction of
sodium azide to inflate the airbag is an exothermic reaction.&quot; Exothermic
means &quot;it gives off heat.&quot; Yes, some heat is used as energy in forming the
nitrogen gas molecules which inflate the bag, but most of the heat
generated remains heat. In that respect, the air bag also inflates so
quickly because of the heat -- sort of like a rapidly filling hot air
balloon. It wouldn't inflate as quickly with cool nitrogen gas, because
the gas would not have any incentive (read &quot;momentum of molecules&quot;) to
inflate the bag.

You were fortunate that you were not burned, but many people have been. It
is a danger worth knowing about.

I've been very surprised by the people in this thread claiming that
airbags have killed children and adults in &quot;5mph crashes&quot;. That is simply
false. Airbags are designed to inflate in crashes of 18mph or faster into
a rigid barrier. That kind of a crash could also be caused by two cars,
each 9mph, hitting directly head on. (Oops, not that thread again)
In that fast a crash, an unbelted person without an airbag will make a
large spiderweb in the windshield with their head. These are not parking
lot fender benders or minor accidents. I feel sorry for the 7-yr old who
died... perhaps he would have lived without an airbag, however his case is
an exception to the rule.
Airbags save lives.
Airbags are most effective when used with a properly belted seatbelt.
If you choose not to use either, you're making a mistake.

Sigh, yes, that thread again, complete with the usual error.

Once again, a car hitting a rigid barrier and decelerating from X mph
to 0 mph experiences *exactly* the same deceleration as do two identical
cars each approaching a common stationary point at X mph (where they
will collide and come to rest).

The &quot;two cars colliding head-on at X mph&quot; scenario is, however,
comparable to one car traveling at 2*X mph colliding head-on with
an identical but stationary car -- both cars will leave the collision
traveling at X mph (one going forward, one going backward), each having
accelerated (or decelerated) by X mph in the instant of collision.

"/> Bob,
either this is wrong or I am reading it wrong...please further explain what
you meant if I have it wrong.

I understand that if 2 (solid, non crumpling) objects were in an
environment with no outside forces (ie. gravity or friction) were to
collide at say 10 MPH they would BOTH reverse directions and both would
still be going 10 MPH.

but the way I read what you wrote is that if they collided....one would
reverse speed to 10 MPH and the other would continue going forward at 10
MPH... for example this is a possible scenario:

X mph = 10 mph

2 identical cars
both going say 10 MPH
they crash head on with an impact of 20 MPH
now here is where it gets messed up....by you explanation one car would
reverse direction and start going 10 MPH backwards and the other car would
continue to go 10 MPH forward
now this just doesnt sound right to me.

it seems like the two cars would both stop on impact or maybe both would
reverse directions slightly and the force of the cars would be dispersed by
gravity, the crumpling of the cars, and heat generated by friction.

I thought you were pro-(helmet)choice..... If I can extend your concern about
protecting people from themselves...Why not make people in cars wear helmets?
We all know motorcycles are more dangerous.. But (serious) Head injuries in
cars FAR OUTNUMBER (serious) head injuries of cyclists Just because or the
sheer number of cars out there. So, again, why not wear a helmet in a car?

GM introduced airbags on several models in the early `70s, and it was
a marketing flop so they withdrew the product within a few years.

Keep in mind the article I was responding to claimed that consumer
demand made airbags a success before they were required by law. Your
reference to the failed introduction of airbags added more validity to
my statement. Otherwise airbags would have become standard equipment
by 1977, when they technology was readily available...but unwanted.

I own a 95 escort GT and was in a rear end collision about 1 month ago.
I know for a fact that I wasnt going more than about 25 km per hour when
I impacted the car infront of me. All it did was break the grill and
buckle the hood slightly...not hard enough to even break a headlight.

Anyways...the airbags went off (to my surprise!!). I had my left hand at
about the 11:00 position on the steering wheel...so when the air bad went
off, my hand got thrust into the windshield, thus CRACKING the windshield
with my fingers. The passenger side airbag totally smashed that side of
the windshield to the point of barely seeing through it.

Afterwards, I almost choked on the smoke residue left from the airbag
deployment...I got out of the car hacking and coughing.

This was totally an incident that airbags were NOT needed and yet they
deployed.

Well over half of the damage incurred in the accident was from the
airbags going off. $1000 for the passenger airbag, $800 for the drivers
side, $500 for the windshield. As well when the drivers side airbag
deploys, it causes the steering column to collaps...I'm not sure on how
much a new steering column was (but i know it had to be replaced).

"/> --
The main consideration in firing the airbags is whether the collision is
very &quot;frontal&quot; or not. They try to make them so they won't go off below
approximately 17 MPH. However this decision has to be made in a
microsecond. Is this a low speed collision or just the beginning of a 60
MPH head on? Better safe than sorry. If the system waits too long you may
be against the airbag when it fires, not a good thing. I hear a lot of
bitching on here about airbags, if anybody doesn't want theirs I will
gladly trade them cars. I feel they are definately a valuable safety
feature (when used correctly), but of course like everything not perfect.
I frequently have to work around and remove these things and often my head
is very near one when I am working on wiring under the dash, this worries
me but I am still glad they are there. There have been some very
unfortunate cases where air bags have caused more damage than they have
saved, many due to lack of information or incorrect use. The dynamics of
any crash are impossible to predict but I would rather have the bag than
just a hard dash. To all out there with air bags in your car, please read
your owners manual completely on their use. Please NEVER have a young
child or baby seat in the front of an air bag equipped car unless you know
this is approved on your particular vehicle. ALWAYS use your seat belts
along with the airbag. Be carefull about having items in the front seat
that may cause harm should an airbag deploy. There is new information
about airbags and children available, if someone can post this it would be
appreciated. I believe the NTSB has a web site that may contain this info.
I do have one beef with the car companies, in commercials they show
airbags as a &quot;billowy&quot; pillow that slowly inflates and you softly bounce
on. In reality an airbag deploy is like a shotgun blast, very fast, very
powerful, very unpleasent, but much better than nothing in MOST cases. Way
too many people die in car accidents. A lot of this I blame on the cars
structure. I think the car companies have severe pressure on them to build
light fuel efficient cars and this is the opposite of safe cars. I think
the manufacturers should be given &quot;safety&quot; points that would apply against
CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards. I believe that many
deaths could be avoided if the cars structure protected the occupants
better from &quot;intrusuion&quot; into the passenger compartment. I used to tow
cars for the state and local police and it sickened me to see the
passenger compartment of some cars after an accident. The people didn't
stand a chance, there simply was no room left in the front seat area,
doors had flown open and car bodies ripped wide open. Many people had
died in cars that were easily repairable (very low speed collisions). This
is a disgrace. As an example I read a few years back that a major foreign
car company had purchased the rights to a new invention. This invention
was to pack box type frame members with a special ceramic bead, this made
the frame much stiffer and stronger than it would have been. What was done
with this? The frames were made smaller and lighter (but no stronger) so
the fuel mileage would be better. I really don't care about a few miles to
the gallon, I do care about people though. Everyone can bitch about
safety features, go to a few accident scenes and realize that the
people being hauled away in body bags are other peoples sons, daughters,
wives, husbands etc. and you just may change your mind. Well I've gone on
too long about this, it just gets me emotionally involved. Cars (structure
wise) are built like shit and something ought to be done about it.

"/> Jason, you'll never get the safety crazies to admit anything bad about airbags.
They'll tell you the airbags worked properly, and that you would have suffered
severe injuries had they not deployed. These nuts all live in ivory towers paid
for by government grants, are scared to death of any car that goes over forty
five miles an hour, take public transportation because they're afraid to take
responsibility for their own lives and thus willingly put their lives blindly
into the hands of others, and can not comprehend that regulatory excesses suck
money from the economy that could be put to far better use than for unnecessary,
unused and often dangerous airbags for automobiles.

Typical of their twisted rationalization process is their shifting blame on
vehicle users for dead and broken children sitting in government mandated car
safety seats having necks snapped, tiny limbs fractured, and skin burned and
scarred.

One of their big lies: airbags will lower your insurance.

(What really happens is that they raise everyone else's insurance the first
year, and then your's the next)

&gt; Thank you too Mr Whittle for your very initiated posting. It must feel
&gt; very good to have all the answers.

&gt; KIn response to the airbag questions, I might offer some &quot;inside&quot;

"/> information. I designed airbag sensors for the auto industry for the
last 7 years. As a GENERAL rule airbags will deploy during an event that
is approximately 12-14mph or greater. There are many reasons for this
number but suffice it to say that in GENERAL this is a reasonable number.
Remeber, the plus/minus three/four sigma event needs to be considered.

And commenting to the above skeptic, airbags help one heck of alot. I
have been envolved with a substantial number of crash testing and have
witnessed first hand what can happen. They are after all designed as
secondary restraints to the seat belts. They are loud, smelly, expensive
and in a VERY VERY rare occasion may not work exactly as planned but I
would never have a car without one.

"/> Wait until there's the requirement to have SIDE airbags, and you and your
passenger get concussions from knocking heads together on an accident like
this one.

Maybe a Civil Litigation suit for the damages caused on an accident where
the airbags caused more injury than the accident itself. There have already
been small children killed because of airbags, and a delayed &quot;oh by the way
don't put rear facing car seats in the front seat&quot; after all these years of
telling us that rear facing car seats can't be put in the back seat. So I
guess those people with small enough children needing rear facing car seats
need now put their children in the TRUNK!

Agreed, I have 2 children that were always put in rear facing car seats in
the back seat (according to instructions) when they were babies. No, I
didn't have airbags in the vehicles but wish I did, my wife was almost
killed in a serious accident at the time.

I bought my Catalina. Bright yellow and an extra three feet between me
and the front of the car. For some reason, people have stopped pulling
out in front of me...

Being someone who frequents junkyards, notice how many little cars are
in the junkyard with no front ends. Very rarely do you see that type of
damage in a big old car. Has anyone ever seen the early 70's Ford crash
test that have a blue Maverick go head on into a LTD (It might have been
a Galaxy)? The Maverick disintgrated and the LTD got a small crinkle in
the hood.

If I can help it, I'll always try to get myself, my family, and my friends into

I think we're at a point in the airbag discussion where we need to
sort out information from misinformation. Let's take a few points.

1. Airbags reduce injury in a crash.
I would say that in the the case of frontal impacts, undeniably. I'm
most familiar with GM airbags (I used to sell Buicks at a dealership), which
are designed to deploy in a frontal crash within 30 degrees of the straight
ahead position at an impact of 14 mph or greater with an immovable object
(like a wall). Note then, that you will have to hit a parked car at a higher
speed to get the airbag to go off.
Statistically an airbag isn't likely to save your life because a) any
given vehicle is (statistically speaking) likely to have it's airbag go off
in a crash about once every 175 years, and b) most crashes, including frontal
ones are not fatal. The real value of an airbag, IMHO, is that in frontal
crashes (about 30% of total accidents), your injuries are reduced. It's
perhaps the difference between breaking a collar bone and your nose, and
just having a couple bruises.

2. Airbags lower your insurance.
Most of the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. Because airbag
equipped vehicles cost more to fix, insurance companies take this into con-
sideration along with the presumed reduction in medical expense due to reduced
injury. There were a couple insurance companies which actually raised their
rates slightly if the customer ordered the optional passenger side air bag
(optional passenger side air bags are very uncommon, and 1996 models generally
make them either standard or unavailable).

3. Air bags go off unnecessarily.
Possible, but not likely. It is true, however, that an airbag going
off does not mean that if it hadn't, you would have been seriously injured.
The air bag is a supplemental restraint system providing an additional line
of protection against injury. (Where one without a seat belt, incidentally,
and you'll feel like Mike Tyson hit you in the face). The airbag goes off
at a 14 mph impact with a stationary object, a speed chosen because it is
about the point where some people begin to have serious injuries even in
belts. It should be noted that the vast majority of people at this speed
don't suffer serious injury at 14 mph WITHOUT seat belts, but nonetheless,
there are well documented cases of serious injuries and even deaths at
speeds as low as 12 mph (without belt). The point being, 14 mph is a conser-
vative safety cushion designed with the idea that it is better to reduce in-
jury than to reduce damage to the car.

I don't drive a car with an airbag, and it's not one of my priorities
to do so. But I do think that they work in the most likely situations (redu-
cing injury, not saving lives). As a side note, air bags have become standard
in most new cars, while anti-lock brakes are optional on most except for GM
cars. I think this is backward, since most drivers will never use their
airbag, but every winter, I get into situations where anti-lock brakes are
useful. Just a thought.

As long as we're debating the relative merits of various safety
technologies, how about let's open the floor and toss-around some ideas
for safe, effective, non-cruddy-looking methods of retrofitting shoulder
belts into older cars that are only equipped with lap belts? Sure, we've
all seen the slap-dash jobs where someone drills a hole in the B-pillar
and puts a through-bolt in, holding some kind of a universal shoulder
belt. I call this kind of job &quot;Slap-dash&quot; because that's what your head
will do when you're in a front-ender and the through-bolt pulls through.
It's necessary to have some kind of reinforcement, but what kind? How can
we do this and not wind up with sloppy- or kludgy-looking welds or
external plates? And how can we do it with existing '70s-'80s stuff so we
don't have to put modern black-and-fluorescent-orange seat belts in
'50s-'60s cars? If it matters, I want to do this on a '62 Dodge Lancer
and a '65 Chrysler Valiant Custom 200. (Canadian model). Both are
4-doors. The Valiant has a wide B-pillar, the Lancer has a narrow one.
One idea that has occurred to me is to pull the headliner and weld-in
reinforcements to the roof for the roof-mounted reels used on mid-late
'70s Oldsmobiles. But the problem is that these require a guide on the
ends of the front seatback, and I'm not sure how I'd add this.
So, the floor is open: anyone?

Daniel,

I haven't done this either, but I have thought about it, and what I
thought was that the best thing to do might be to install race harnesses
rather than shoulder belts. I am not sure I am using the term harness
correctly but what I am talking about are what I think you would
usually see in a race car, where you have a buckle which sits right on top
of your belt buckle, and is attached to 1/2 of a lap belt, and has three
holes, one for the other half of the lap belt, and two for two shoulder
straps, which of course go straight up and over each shoulder and down
behind the back of the seat, I supppose. Anyway this might allow for
a cleaner installation, if you bolt the ends to the floor behind the driver's
seat. At least you could beef up the holes as much as you like and
cover the metalwork back up with the carpet.

Of course two shoulder straps would be much much better that one, I
I would think.

just my .02

Some of the older cars have attachment points for shoulder belts already
in the B-Pillars. I found them in my '68 C-20 truck, and installed the
belts from a '91 (and seat, too). So, maybe, there were laws in some
places that required that feature, but not in others? So installation
provsions MIGHT be there.

One idea would be use belts like those in '68 to '73 fords.
It was a two piece system where a standard lap belt was used with
a reel at the floor and an attaching shoulder belt.
the shoulder belt is simply an adjustable length belt attached to the
the b pillar and the other end clips to the lap belt's buckle before
inserting it into the reciever. For some cars this two-piece
arragement may be much easier to install since it does not require
the shoulder part to be routed to the reel.
I have seen this type of belt in mavericks and mustangs, in fact that
is the type in my '73 maverick, I thought it would be a pain at first
but as it turns out once you are used to them its about the same and
the shoulder and lap parts can remain connected for easier use.

"/> I recently did just this with my '68 Charger; the factory shoulder belt
(which was added at the last minute in '68) had been removed because it
was poorly located and difficult to use.

So after my face met the steering wheel during a hit and run last year, I
thought it might be time to install shoulder harnesses.

Instead of bolting them to the floor (which puts stress on the seat and
may result in the seat buckling during an impact), and not wanting to
irreversibly alter the interior with a roll bar, I thought I'd try something
a little different.

So I welded up a bar of 1&quot; square steel pipe that bolts to the former
shoulder belt anchor points. Now I have my 5-point harnesses mounted as
if they were on a full rollcage, but it's easily returnable to &quot;stock&quot; form.
It works quite well (especially coupled with my new bucket seats), though
I find I need to leave the shoulder harnesses off when driving in reverse
or manuevering in tight places. But they go on before I leave the parking lot.

The 3&quot; webbing (and the copious amounts of it) takes a little getting used to,
but I certainly feel safer. And I have no doubt that it _is_ safer.

Looks pretty cool, too ;-)

Then why has VW and others developed the smaller &quot;face&quot; air bags for
Europe if they were not mandated? It would have been cheaper just to
offer the US airbags there.

No, air bags are not mandatory across Europe (my car has none), but tend to
come fitted to all new cars.

This is going to lead to some problems in years to come - it is not common
knowledge over here, but air bags are _VERY_ dangerous when carrying small
children in baby-seats. A warning is printed about this on all the boxes of
these seats, but in tiny lettering so that most people miss it.

&gt;when you would rather it not fire. I'd like to have a little more
&gt;control, rather than have the car manufactures think they know what's
&gt;best for me.

"/> What are you people doing putting a baby seat on the front seat? The bolthole
is on the rear parcel shelf (sedan), or on the rear roof or near the tailgat
(wagon and hatch), and as such the rear seat is the only place a baby seat
should be used. If anyone is dumb enough to put the baby seat in front, they
would probably be too stupid to read and understand the warning, however large
the lettering.

It's my understanding that they work by measuring speed and deceleration,
and that 2-3 separate sensors have to agree to trigger it. One is

"/> I agree on that for Jeep Cherokee, but maybe not for some other cars.
sports utility vehicles generally have high suspention travel and
dampers are generally softer. I'm not sure if the airbag sensors
setup is different between trucks and sports cars, but if a driver
decides to install after-market stiffer springs and shocks, would it
screw up the airbag sensor setup? Obviously, the chassis would take
a lot more beating if he/she hits a big bump. I do know for a fact
that Ferrari had problem fitting airbags, initially in '90 or '91,
due to tight suspention system. Also Formula One cars cancelled the
airbag rule due to the same problem.

"/> In that vein, the newest insurance fraud by unscrupulous shops is to
keep a deployed air bag handy. When a car comes in with the air bag
UNDEPLOYED, they slap in the deployed one and charge the insurance
company for a new bag. Once the adjuster is gone, they put the old bag
- the one in tact - back in. Instant $500-$3,000 for the body man. You

"/> There's a matter that isn't being addressed here yet. In a nutshell,
the sensors are a type of P/I transducer. However they are activated, the
physical (pressure) change of a crash is converted
to an electrical signal. It takes approximately 15 milliseconds for
this signal to reach the activating mechanism. My point is, that
ultimately the airbag is activated by an electrical signal. If
someone doesn't know what they're doing and are 'messing
around' with your fuse panels/junction boxes under the dash or
the hood, they can accidentally short circuit/activate the
mechanism. Thus, with all the distributor-less vehicles, computer
controls and modules, etc., everywhere, there is a much greater
chance of accidental deployment. TJ

"/> The type of &quot;accelerometer&quot; typically used is the &quot;Breed&quot; type. It's
essentially a steel ball and magnet in a tube, with a small space around
the ball to add damping and two electrical contacts at the end opposite
the magnet. This device is only sensitive in one direction (nominally),
so transverse impacts won't trigger it.

If a piezoelectric accelerometer is used, it will still have very little
transverse sensitivity. Rear impacts can be sensed by looking at the
difference in charge; it will be positive one way, negative the other.

Remember, though, that if you are hit on an angle (that is, not straight
on or straight from the side) that's the same as some combination of
straight on and from the side. If the straight-on component is large
enough, the bag will deploy.

Gentlemen,
My new K1500 has at least two airbag sensors (that I have found so far).
Both are mounted to the chasis, not the bumper. I do not know exactly
how much deceleration is required to fire the bag, but side impacts will
not do it, nor will rear impacts.

"/> Actually, the technology is over 20 years old. There were companies
offering air bags as an accessory for a steering wheel in 1973.
Allstate Insurance had a fleet of fifty 1976 Mercuries (the big one)
equipped with them. General Motors offered air bags as an expensive
($900 up) option on some of the high-end Olds, Buick, etc., models in
the early 80s, but few were actually sold. Lee Iacocca was one of the
leaders of the forces keeping the US government from requiring passive
restraints.

However, around 1989, when Iacocca was trying to pull Chrysler
Corporation out of the depths, the company seized on air bags as a way
of differentiating Chrysler products from the others, so Chrysler
became one of the first manufacturers to offer them on a variety of
cars.

Oh BTW: It take 2 activators to cause the air bag to deploy. (meaning
that if only 1 activates, no bag. any combination of 2 activated at
once, and the bag will deploy...

Airbags were much better in the 1970's when they inflated from a
bottle of pre-compressed gas instead of explosives they use today. It
gave a much &quot;softer&quot; yet still virtually instantaneous inflation, no
minor bumps and bruises, no stinking smoke in the car. Triggering
mechanisms however are much better today, although not bad then.

Few were ever sold. My '74 Toronado has them. GM's system comprised
dual airbags, protection for all three front passengers.
I don't know that Mercury ever offered them, perhaps they were
custom-fitted. At any rate the compressed gas models then had, in my
view anyhow, preferable deployment characteristics compared to today's
explosively deployed models.
