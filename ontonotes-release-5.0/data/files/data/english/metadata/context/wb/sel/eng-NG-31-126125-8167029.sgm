Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

Would he do it?  He's probably pissed-off with the way he was parodied
cruelly in the character of Mr Saxon, a politician who's popular
because people think he's nice guy even though no-one (not even his
own party) knows what his policies are.

Yes, but not all at the same time.  When the episode was written,
Blair was a very unpopular PM because everyone knew only too well what
his policies were, while Cameron was very popular and had no policies

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, but not all at the same time.  When the episode was written,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Blair was a very unpopular PM because everyone knew only too well what
&gt;&gt;&gt;his policies were, while Cameron was very popular and had no policies
&gt;&gt;&gt;at all.

&gt;&gt;But even if Cameron actually had any policies, do you think most of the
&gt;&gt;British public would know or care? Seems to me that most people vote for 1
&gt;&gt;of 2 reasons:
&gt;&gt;1. It's the way they've always voted.
&gt;&gt;2. They vote for whichever party leader looks best on the TV.

&gt;3. They hear the drums.

Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

You still don't understand

Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yes, but not all at the same time.  When the episode was written,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Blair was a very unpopular PM because everyone knew only too well what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his policies were, while Cameron was very popular and had no policies
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;at all.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And in May 1997 the whole of the Labor election manifesto boiled down
&gt; &gt;&gt; to: &quot;Things can only get better&quot;. (They were wrong even about that.)

&gt; &gt;True.  And if this episode had been written in 1997, it would have
&gt; &gt;been parodying Blair.  But more recently, Cameron's taken over that
&gt; &gt;role.

&gt; How about Both Brown and Cameron at the same table.
