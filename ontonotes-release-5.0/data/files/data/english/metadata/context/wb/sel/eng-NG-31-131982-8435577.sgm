Entering a whirlwind of different colors that looked as if an artist's
palette had spilled over the ground, Charity fell, swirling in the
brilliancy. She opened her eyes to see a red headed witch in a pirates
costume peering curiously down at her.

&quot;Oh!&quot; the witch gave a little start. &quot;You're alive! Tell me, WHAT are
you? And where do you fall from?&quot; she asked.

&quot;What- what do you mean what am I?&quot; She said slowly standing up. &quot;And
I'm from Harmony...&quot; She looked around &quot;But something tells me I'm not
in Harmony anymore.&quot;

Hecuba looked around, alarmingly, like she was hearing bells.
&quot;Harmony? Harmony, she says? Hark! What is that sound in the air? Do I
detect a song to begin?&quot; she smiled warmly at the blonde girl with
gold ringlets before her. &quot;Please, dear. Sing it with lots of harmony.&quot;

Charity looked at Hecuba as is she were crazy. &quot;I'm sorry. I don't
sing-&quot; She still looked around wondering how hard she must have
fallen.

&quot;Don't sing! Don't sing!&quot; she looked as though she were about to fall
down herself. &quot;Why, anyone who crosses the path of the Great Hecuba
MUST sing.... at least...&quot; she paused. &quot;if you want to get on my GOOD
side...&quot; she waved her wand in the air which had simply magically
appeared in her hand at that moment. &quot;Unless... unless you are a bad
witch.&quot; a shadow twisted darkly across her face.

&quot;A bad what?&quot; Charity really wasn't buying all this.

&quot;A BAD WITCH DEAR!&quot; Hecuba corrected her.

&quot;I'm not a bad witch.. I just don't sing.&quot;

&quot;If you are a good witch then you shall have no problem singing..&quot;

&quot;But I'm not a witch at all!&quot; She exclaimed. She tried to calm herself
down but she just wanted to go home. &quot;All I remember... is closing my
eyes.....&quot; She began to sing. &quot;I remember seeing his face.... So sweet
and nice.... then the darkness arrived....&quot;

&quot;Ohhh, how lovely,&quot; Hecuba clasped her hands at her heart. &quot;I love a
good romance! Wait.&quot; her smile instantly vanished. &quot;Did you say the
DARKNESS arrived??&quot; her eyes darted back and forth as though the
darkness was ready to jump out of the bushes.

Charity nodded. &quot;Yes... it felt so cold... and so full of anger......
and then I woke up here....&quot;

&quot;Well, I can definitely agree with you there,&quot; Hecuba laughed,
touching Charity's shoulder understandingly, at least from her
perspective. &quot;I have had MORE then my share of wake up calls in this
land of wonder. But, my dear, you make it sound like a dream.... all
this anger and coldness can't be good for your.... soul. are you sure
this so called romance is the right one for you?&quot;

&quot;It wasn't me... it was something or someone else....&quot; Charity said
suddenly getting a chill.  She looked around feeling as though she
were being watched.

Hecuba shivered violently and pulled her shawl up around her
shoulders. &quot;Is it just me or do I detect an icy cold breeze sent down
from that frigid old witch of the north?&quot; she shook her fist in the
direction of what one would only hope to be north. &quot;Hey! You, up
there! Hold your ice pellets and let's play with fire!&quot;

Charity took this clever opportunity to her advantage and snuck away
from the weird witchy woman.

Meanwhile, Hank was wondering down a path headed somewhere. &quot;This is
the shittiest dream I've ever had. And why do I feel so light on my
feet? Like my body is weightless?&quot; he did a kind of half-ski, half
jump in the air.

Charity headed off. Where in the world was she? &quot;I just want to go
home-&quot; She mumbled as she accidentally ran into someone. She looked up
and smiled. &quot;Hank! Finally someone normal&quot;

&quot;Charity!&quot; he ran to her, nearly falling over his feet. &quot;Thank the
unnamed God I found you.&quot; he was so happy to see her he felt like
kissing her. Wait, why didn't he? after all, this was a dream. His
dream. he could do anything he felt like. And so, he leaned in to kiss
her.

&quot;Hank&quot; She pulled away. &quot;We need to get outta here... Theres something
not right....&quot; She still felt the coldness around her.

Hank wrapped his arms around her shoulders, trying to keep her warm,
seeing her shivering like that. &quot;It's gonna be alright, Char. I can
feel it, too. Something is definitely off..... I'm just glad you're in
this dream with me.&quot;

Meanwhile, the witch cackled to herself, delightedly as she watched
them through her enchanted mirror up in her castle. Normally, that
time of day she'd have the mirror tuned to her own reflection, and
commending herself for her sensational work as wicked witch but that
day was special seeing as the land had visitors from afar. A raven,
which remained loyally perched on her right shoulder, her only
confidante in the world, cawed with pleasure seeing the young girl and
the funny man she was standing with. &quot;Ah yes.... that's right, find a
way out of here and you'll find a way right to the palm of my
hands..... hahahahaha! and then your hair.... errr... POWER shall be
mine!!!&quot; she made a fist, clenching the air.

&quot;I don't think we're dreaming...&quot; Charity whispered.

&quot;Course it is. It has to be&quot; Hank stated.

&quot;I don't know... but this feels much more than a dream...&quot; Charity
shivered.

&quot;Much more than a dream...&quot; repeated the witch, waving two clawlike
hands over her glass. &quot;And so much more than meets the eye...&quot; she
cackled, mischievously.

&quot;CAW,&quot; went the raven before it spoke, &quot;Would you like us to go down
and reek some havoc upon our wanderers, my lady?&quot; it asked anxiously.

&quot;Hmm.... perhaps that would show them we mean business and are NOT to
be taken lightly, under any measures... YES, Lucifus.... gather  your
minions and go out and have some fun. But NO pecking eyeballs out yet,
my pet.&quot; she crooned, stroking its soft feathers. &quot;No... that would be
drastic...&quot;

The raven flew off, trying not to seem disappointed.

**

&quot;Well, it looks like a storm is setting in, look at that cloud.&quot; Hank
pointed up to a rapidly approaching black cloud in the sky. &quot;We better
find some shelter.&quot;

&quot;But..... where?&quot; Charity whirled around.

&quot;Damn, this is all we need......&quot; Hank sighed, desperately looking all
around.

Charity gripped Hank's arm, frightened, her eyes staring at the cloud.
&quot;Hank, I don't think that's a storm cloud...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? Of course it is... what else.... could... it...
be....?&quot; he trailed off, his eyes widening in horror. &quot;Are those
wings?&quot;

&quot;Yes! Oh my God! Hank! They're birds and they're heading straight for
us! RUN!!!&quot; she grabbed his arm, turning to go somewhere, anywhere.

Meanwhile, they were not alone, as someone with a greater power was
looking down on them, smiling. &quot;I don't believe in torture. No one
deserves the fate that's headed for them right now. No matter how
nauseatingly pure they are.&quot; said Hecuba as she watched a safe
distance away from inside her pink bubble. She waved her wand and made
a house with a white picket fence appear in Hank and Charity's path.
&quot;There. Go inside and rest. You're gonna need it for the journey that
seems to have only JUST begun.&quot; Hecuba spoke, a satisfied tone to her
voice as she smirked at the incoming ravens. &quot;Stupid birds.&quot;

&quot;Where in the world did this come from?&quot; Charity said as they
stopped.

&quot;I don't know. I've quit questioning this place. Now lets go!&quot; He said
as he pulled her along into the house, locking the door behind.

They sat down on the couch trying to catch their breath.

Charity felt her eyes fluttering. &quot;I'm so... tired...&quot; She yawned and
put her head against his shoulder and fell fast asleep.
