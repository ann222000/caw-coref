Wow, this is *obviously* evidence that meat is evil and omnivores are the
scourge of the earth. There would be no problem with PCBs and mercury in
aquatic life if the hazards of these chemicals had been identified sooner,
before industry and manufacturing had discharged significant quantities
into the watersheds. Surprise, these chemicals can be found in others
places--like your drinking water. Maybe instead of nagging at folks who
have normal diets, you should use this in alt.whiners.industry-is-evil.

'&quot;Levels of 14 different chemical contaminates pesticides are higher

O. Carpenter, a professor of environmental health and toxicology
and director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the
State University of New York at Albany.

In the current study, the largest to date, Carpenter's team tested more
than 2 metric tons of farmed and wild salmon from around the world.

They found farm-raised salmon had significantly higher PCB levels
and many chlorinated pesticides than wild Pacific salmon. The
researchers report the finding in the Jan. 9 issue of Science . High
PCB levels in farmed salmon result from the fish meal and fish oil
they are fed. '

If you have suddenly lost your appetite for salmon, don't get too fond of the other
options. Trouble is brewing for all farmed seafood, reports Stephen Khan
Stephen Khan
Sunday January 11, 2004
The Observer
http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/Story/0,2763,1120569,00.html

Stacks of salmon steaks and fillets remained on ice at Chapel Street Market in Islington
on Friday. Only weeks ago ago they were disappearing at a record rate, destined for
millions of festive dinner tables. Now shoppers flashed a concerned glance and passed by.
Farmed fish was having its mad cow moment.

Just as BSE research prompted an EU ban and shoppers' boycott of beef almost eight years
ago, now public confidence was being rocked in the very foodstuff nutritionists have been
telling us we must eat more of.

Salmo salar, the Atlantic salmon, is no stranger to health scares. Rarely has a month
passed in recent years without a television programme or a feature in a magazine raising
concerns about aquaculture, the fastest-growing sector of the global food economy. But
Friday was something different.

This was not some fringe pressure group or band of tree-hugging environmentalists out to
rattle cages. It was some of the world's leading experts on industrial pollution. And what
they had to say was devastating: farmed salmon was poisonous. What's more, the most
dangerous fish of all were salmon raised in Scotland.

Researchers based at the University of Albany in New York revealed in the journal Science
how they found high levels of contaminants such as PCBs, dioxins and pesticides in
Scottish fish, which is marketed around the world as a premium product. Eating more than
three portions a year, they warned, risked increasing the consumer's chances of developing
cancer.

In Britain, 99 per cent of salmon sold in fishmongers and supermarkets comes from Scottish
farms. They moved swiftly to assuage customer fears but the impact of the findings already
appears to have been powerful. Across the UK this weekend sides of smoked pink fish 'fresh
from the crystal clear waters of Scotland' sat untouched on shelves alongside curiosities
such as salmon nuggets and tikka bites. Staff in one branch of Tesco near Glasgow
estimated that the store was shifting less than half its usual stock of farmed fish.

Back at the Islington market in London, Jamie Curtis revealed that sales had nosedived.
'I've had people coming up to me all day,' he said. 'A lot of customers have been saying
that since hearing the news about the risks associated with eating salmon they're going to
give it up for good.'

On hearing details of the American research, one shopper considered ditching her purchase.
Nicola Burn, a 30-year-old teacher, said: 'If I had known about it I'm not so sure I would
have put this packet of salmon in my basket. I'll definitely be reading the labels on fish
more carefully from now on.'

Reactions like this will distress Scottish fish farmers as they begin the mammoth task
this week of attempting to rebuild public trust. For them - and for Britain's baffled
consumers - further confusion and uncertainty lie ahead.

The intensity of their reaction to the revelations is a clear indication of just how
worried fish farmers are. In Scotland alone the business is worth £700 million and
supports more than 6,500 jobs - mainly in remote areas with a history of high
unemployment.

The country's 300 salmon farms produce 160,000 tonnes of fish a year. Industry
representatives insisted farmed salmon was safe and claimed the American team's report
was misleading. They called on support from the Food Standards Agency and politicians,
who are well aware that aquaculture accounts for half of the value of all Scottish food
exports.

Much of the blame for the high contamination readings has been heaped on the feed used
to raise the fish. Environmentalists have long criticised this aspect of the industry as it
relies on wild fish being caught and ground into pellets to feed their captive cousins.
They have pointed out that it takes three tons of wild fish to produce one ton of the
farmed variety. It is, therefore, fundamentally an unsustainable industry.

Now the research published in Science suggests that this feed, harvested from the polluted
waters of the North Sea, results in the fish farmed in the area being more contaminated
than those elsewhere.

Aquaculture critics had already pointed out that the polluted waters of the northern
hemisphere produce farmed fish with contamination levels eight times greater than those in
the southern hemisphere farms of Chile, Australia and Africa.

The world's largest producer of salmon feed is EWOS, based in Bathgate, West Lothian.
Managing director Neil Spreckley yesterday defended the business and said it was
constantly seeking to improve methods. 'Industrial pollution is not as bad as it was 20 or
30 years ago. The raw materials going into fish feed have improved. We are trying to
formulate more ingredients which are lower in PCBs and dioxins such as soya and linseed
vegetable oils. The problem is that salmon's natural diet is to eat fish.'

And that, say anti-aquaculture campaigners, is the problem with the entire industry. What
we are witnessing with salmon now will be replicated across the dozens of other
carnivorous species being reared in captivity around the world.

Projections indicate that by 2020 more farmed fish will be eaten than those caught in the
wild. Already aquaculture is worth more than £30 billion a year globally and the number of
species that ate being developed is rapidly increasing.

Like salmon and trout, the vast majority of sea bass and bream consumed in Britain comes
from farms. Mediterranean countries such as Greece have raced ahead in the production of
such species that require warmer waters. Tuna is also being developed, and the Japanese
have even floated the idea of a huge minke whale farm.

Here and in Norway, though, all eyes are on halibut and cod - the great hope of
aquaculture. Proponents say that both offer the prospect of cleaner, more sustainable
farming than salmon.

One person who won't be serving any of them, however, is Jackie MacKenzie who worked
at a fish farm in the north-west of Scotland for three years in the 1990s before quitting over
concerns that the chemicals he was using were having a detrimental effect upon his health.

'There used to be fresh salmon on the table when I was a boy,' he told The Observer. 'But
that was a different fish to what we get now. I wouldn't feed my children the stuff that
comes out of these farms.'

He claimed that the aquaculture industry had taken a quality product and turned it into
'gunk'. Wild salmon, he said, was a firm, muscular, healthy fish. What now masqueraded
as the king of fish was a flabby, dyed-pink beast that bore little resemblance to its wild
relative.

He warned that it was inevitable that other species would develop problems in captivity.
'All fish have their diseases, and when you cram lots of them into a confined space it is
inevitable the disease will spread. Then chemicals are introduced in an attempt to control
things.'

Along with feed and chemicals, MacKenzie lists escaping fish as one of the main,
unavoidable problems of sea-cage fish farming. Wherever there are fish in captivity, there
are jailbreaks. Inevitably, wild populations are affected. A Pacific salmon from farms in
contaminated waters off the north-west coast of Russia was recently found in Scotland.

Diseases are passed on, and cross-breeding has resulted in deformities and genetic
mutations that have seen a stark drop in wild salmon stocks since farms arrived in
Scotland in the late 1970s.

MacKenzie and other anti-aquaculture campaigners welcome the Albany report, claiming
that for years they were seen as crackpots standing in the way of progress. 'Finally the
concerns we have are being recognised by others,' said the ex-fish farmer.

The revelations in the journal Science come as it is revealed that 27 imports of smoked
salmon were last year condemned by the powerful US government watchdog, the Food
and Drug Administration, as unfit for human consumption following random checks.

These included 15 shipments of smoked salmon which were turned away because they were
contaminated with listeria and a further nine salmon shipments from Scotland which were
classified as 'insanitary'.

In Britain, a million Scottish-farmed salmon a week were sold during the Christmas period.
Thousands more trout, sea bass, sea bream and cod that lived and died in captivity were
also eaten. None, however, passed the MacKenzie family's lips. It appears that many more
families up and down the country are now following their lead.

· How fish are farmed

Atlantic salmon
Main producers are Norway, Chile and Scotland. Worldwide production exceeds
one million tonnes a year. Between 5,000 and 50,000 fish are held in sea cages. The
colourings astaxanthin and canthaxanthin are used to dye flesh pink. Fish are treated
with antibiotics, injected with vaccines and fed on fishmeal and oil extracted from 'trash
fish' living in polluted waters. As a result, farmed salmon contain carcinogenic PCBs,
dioxins and mercury as well as pesticides.

Rainbow trout
Raised in France, Italy, Denmark and the UK. Britain produces 35 million fish a year.
As with salmon, antibiotics, vaccines and colourings are heavily used.

Cod
Norway hopes to farm 10,000 tonnes this year. Like salmon, the fishmeal fed to cod
contains PCBs, dioxins and other pollutants. Stocking densities in cages are similar to
salmon, with higher mortality rates.

Halibut
Production in its infancy, led by Norway followed by Iceland and ...

'Iowa farmers turn to fruit, vegetable crops

An increasing number of Iowa farmers are growing fruits
and vegetables, according to results of the latest survey
of commercial producers from the Iowa Department of
Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS).

Nearly 500 growers reported selling vegetables during the
2000 crop year, accounting for more than 8,400 acres of
vegetable production that resulted in $15.9 million in sales.
Nearly 300 growers reported selling fruits, berries and nuts
during the 2000 crop year, accounting for more than 1,600
acres of fruit production that resulted in $3.8 million in sales.

"/> Generally speaking, very little of the land in Texas is commercially
viable for apple or orange production; it is much more suitable for
cattle production, which is why we raise more cattle than we plant apple
trees. In fairness to the Irish skag, Texas has citrus production in the
Rio Grande valley. Our largest citrus crop is red grapefruit, but we
also have an orange crop. In addition to the following link, do your own
search on &quot;Texas citrus.&quot;

We have some commercial apple production as well. As the following link
notes, apple production in Texas is hindered by several factors
including pests and climate. There are some successful Texas apple
growers, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Peaches,
though, do very well here.

toxins. Remeber, most of the stuff found in salmon has been widely
used as insecticides for many years. And some insecticides, like TEPP,
and Bladan's most toxic products are far, far more toxic than any of
those mentioned. But they are still sold to the third world, like
countries in Asia. That also apply to low-toxic compounds like DDT
(compared to TEPP)

Those ages are near enough to be used to calculate meat gain %.

protein + water = meat
(1) 65.8% of 450lbs carcass, (4) 54.3% of 750lbs carcass.
= 296.1 = 407.25
- a gain of 111.15lbs of meat for + 300lbs of carcass weight-
or 37.0% of feedlot carcass gain.

Total increase; carcass + wastage -- 1258-900 = 358lbs.

Meat gain- % of liveweight gain; 111.15/358 * 100 = 31% .

2.5 lbs liveweight gain x 31% = 0.77 pounds meat.
--------------------------------------------------------------
32.5 pounds intake / 0.77 = 42.2, or 42 :1, feed : meat gain,
on a medium-high grain ration + silage &amp; hay. (not DM)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Here we'll add 10% fat..,
Add 10% of 0.77lbs meat for fat content = 0.85 pounds beef.
32.5 pounds intake / 0.85 = 38.23, or 38 :1, feed : beef gain.

That'll do. (leaving out DM calculations).

Galloping Gout Blamed On Fad Diets
The Guardian - UK
1-18-4
...
About 0.5 per cent of the UK population in the Fifties suffered
from gout. The latest figures suggest that figure is now around
1 per cent - 500,000 people.

Dr Snaith added that the Atkins diet could precipitate gout,
because, as a high-protein diet, it burns off fat and produces
lactic acid. It then joins a queue of acids waiting to be expelled
by the kidneys and uric acid levels remain high. Crystallisation
follows.That is what happened to 40-year-old Richard Jaques.

'I'm an ex-rugby player and carry a bit of weight,' he said.
'I went on the Atkins last year.' The side-effects of the diet
triggered an attack. Jaques is hit by three or four bouts of
gout a year, but the Atkins-led episode was different.
'Normally it comes on quickly, but when I was following
the Atkins it built up slowly over three weeks. By the end
I was in a lot of pain.'

Problem is, people can just go and try it. If they then don't die, then
their friends will try it. Rubbishing the Atkins diet is actually a waste of

Back On Meat, Cheese, Butter
1-18-4

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Promoters of the popular low-carbohydrate,
high-fat Adkins diet are saying that people should limit their intake of
saturated fat by cutting back on Atkins staples such as meat, cheese
and butter, The New York Times reported on Sunday.

Responding to criticism from scientists that Atkins could lead to heart
disease and other health problems, the director of research and
education for Atkins Nutritionals, Colette Heimowitz, is telling health
professionals that only 20 percent of a dieter's calories should come
from saturated fat, the paper said.

'Plasma lipids and diet groups

The first article published about this study compared concentrations
of total cholesterol and various lipoprotein fractions in 4 diet groups:
vegans, who never ate animal products; vegetarians, who never ate
meat or fish but did eat dairy products, eggs, or both; fish eaters, who
ate fish but no meat; and meat eaters (4). Both total- and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations were significantly lower in vegans than in meat eaters,
whereas vegetarians and fish eaters had similar, intermediate values.
HDL-cholesterol concentrations were highest in fish eaters but did not
differ among the other diet groups. Mean cholesterol concentrations for
vegans, vegetarians, fish eaters, and meat eaters, adjusted for age and
sex, are shown in Table 1. On the basis of these results, it was predicted
that the incidence of ischemic heart disease might be 24% lower in
lifelong vegetarians and 57% lower in lifelong vegans than in meat
eaters.
....
The most striking results from the analysis were the strong positive
associations between increasing consumption of animal fats and ischemic
heart disease mortality [death rate ratios (and 95% CIs) for the highest
third of intake compared with the lowest third in subjects with no prior
disease were 3.29 (1.50, 7.21) for total animal fat, 2.77 (1.25, 6.13)
for saturated animal fat, and 3.53 (1.57, 7.96) for dietary cholesterol;
P for trend: &lt;0.01, &lt;0.01, and &lt;0.001, respectively]. In contrast, no
protective effects were noted for dietary fiber, fish, or alcohol consumption.
Consumption of eggs and cheese were both positively associated with
ischemic heart disease mortality in these subjects (P for trend, &lt; 0.01 for
both foods).

Effect of a diet high in vegetables, fruit, and nuts on serum lipids.

Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Center, Division
of Endocrinology, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

We assessed the effect of a diet high in leafy and green vegetables,
fruit, and nuts on serum lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Ten healthy volunteers (seven men and three women aged 33 +/- 4
years [mean +/- SEM]; body mass index, 23 +/- 1 kg/m2) consumed
their habitual diet (control diet, 29% +/- 2% fat calories) and a diet
consisting largely of leafy and other low-calorie vegetables, fruit, and
nuts (vegetable diet, 25% +/- 3% fat calories) for two 2-week periods
in a randomized crossover design. After 2 weeks on the vegetable diet,
lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease were significantly reduced
by comparison with the control diet (low-density lipoprotein [LDL]
cholesterol, 33% +/- 4%, P &lt; .001; ratio of total to high-density
lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, 21% +/- 4%, P X .001; apolipoprotein
[apo] B:A-I, 23% +/- 2%, P &lt; .001; and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)],
24% +/- 9%, P = .031). The reduction in apo B was related to
increased intakes of soluble fiber (r = .84, P = .003) and vegetable
protein (r = -.65, P = .041). On the vegetable compared with the
control diet, the reduction in total serum cholesterol was 34% to
49% greater than would be predicted by differences in dietary fat and
cholesterol. A diet consisting largely of low-calorie vegetables and
fruit and nuts markedly reduced lipid risk factors for cardiovascular
disease. Several aspects of such diets, which may have been consumed
early in human evolution, have implications for cardiovascular disease
prevention.

Animal product consumption and mortality because of all

Snowdon DA.
Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis.
This report reviews, contrasts, and illustrates previously published
findings from a cohort of 27,529 California Seventh-day Adventist
adults who completed questionnaires in 1960 and were followed
for mortality between 1960 and 1980. Within this population, meat
consumption was positively associated with mortality because of all
causes of death combined (in males), coronary heart disease (in
males and females), and diabetes (in males). Egg consumption was
positively associated with mortality because of all causes combined
(in females), coronary heart disease (in females), and cancers of the
colon (in males and females combined) and ovary. Milk consumption
was positively associated with only prostate cancer mortality, and
cheese consumption did not have a clear relationship with any cause
of death. The consumption of meat, eggs, milk, and cheese did not
have negative associations with any of the causes of death investigated.

"/> Well, vegetarians are vegetarians because they think it is unethical
to kill animals because they are living individs. But so are
vegetables, bacteria and everything else edible before we kill them
for food. So they should decide to eat only inorganic things, or
accept that eating animals is no worse than eating a cauliflower
(except that wild animals are able to flee if you use old fashioned
weapons, while cauliflowers has to face death anyway.

more important than letting depressions overtake my mind grumbling

Here you go;
---------------------------------------------------------------

Calculations feed : beef.

Table 5. Corn grain, medium quality hay and corn silage.

Daily Corn Protein Lime-
Weight Gain Intake Grain Hay Silage Supplement stone

800 2.5 30.3 7.5 5.3 14.2 3.1 0.19

http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extpubs/ansci/beef/as1163-1.htm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --
Average daily gain 2.5 pounds (liveweight).
Medium-high concentrate ration grain + corn silage + hay - average 32.5 lbs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

Live-weight 900 1040 1146 1258 1403 lb
'harvest' 1 ..... 2 .... 3 .... 4 ...... 5
Fat % 17.7 ........22.6 ..... 28.1 .......30.3 ..........34.0
Protein % 14.5 ........13.9 .......12.6 ......12.0 ..........11.6
Water % 51.3 ...... 48.0....... 43.9 ...... 42.3.......... 40.1
Bone % 16.4 ....... 15.4 ...... 15.4 ...... 15.3 .........14.3
carcass weight 450 550 650 750 850 lbs.
http://ars.sdstate.edu/BeefExt/BeefReports/2000/influence_of_body_wei...

Those ages are near enough to be used to calculate meat gain %.

protein + water = meat
(1) 65.8% of 450lbs carcass, (4) 54.3% of 750lbs carcass.
= 296.1 = 407.25
- a gain of 111.15lbs of meat for + 300lbs of carcass weight-
or 37.0% of feedlot carcass gain.

Total increase; carcass + wastage -- 1258-900 = 358lbs.

Meat gain- % of liveweight gain; 111.15/358 * 100 = 31% .

2.5 lbs liveweight gain x 31% = 0.77 pounds meat.
--------------------------------------------------------------
32.5 pounds intake / 0.77 = 42.2, or 42 :1, feed : meat gain,
on a medium-high grain ration + silage &amp; hay. (not DM)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Here we'll add 10% fat..,
---------------------------------------------------------------
dd 10% to 0.77lbs meat for fat content = 0.85 pounds beef.
32.5 pounds intake / 0.85 = 38.23, or 38 :1, feed : beef gain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I see how &quot;&quot;pearl&quot; arrives at her &quot;mathematical&quot; conclusions...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You've yet to show any error in my mathematical conclusions, swamp.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Swamp is one of many who have shown numerous errors in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; calculations you received from Dreck &lt;snip idiotic smears&gt;

&gt;&gt; Interesting: tap one of the heads and another one pops up screaming.

&gt;&gt; No 'anti' has shown any errors in my calculations. Nor did I receive any
&gt;&gt; of the calculations from Derek. Why don't -you- point out an error, kdb?

&gt; To further explain my ITRUE) calculations in my previous post,
&gt; here's a link showing the number of pounds of various crops:

&gt; http://agguide.agronomy.psu.edu/weights.htm

&gt; Note the second item on the list. A bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds.
&gt; At $2.60 to $2.85 per bushel, that's approximately 5 cents per pound.

&gt; Kevin

"/>  Damn google, my original post didn't go through. I'll try again.
Here are current prices for grain and beef cattle (I chose the markets
closest to me but any markets will result in similar results):

http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/NV_LS147.txt

http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/LR_GR110.txt

By these two documents we see that corn is selling for around $2.60
to $2.85 per bushel or about 5 cents per pound. Also, the live weight
market price for beef cattle is under $1 per pound and decreases as
weight increases. Therefore, using figures you have, uh, calculated(?)
of a ratio of 80 to 1 or higher, it takes more than $4 worth of grain
to produce $1 worth of beef. For this to be true, one of the following
would have to be the case:

1) The cattlemen are buying grain to feed to cattle and losing over
75% of their investment in the process, or

2) A farmer is producing both the grain and the cattle and, instead
of taking the $4 and staying out of the cattle business, he is
intentionally redusing his own potential income by more than 75%.

Either case is, of course, ludicrous and part of the lie you and
Dreck have dreamed up because neither of you possesses the
mathematical competence to realize how patently ridiculous your claims
are. In fact, once all other costs are considered, anything greater
than about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio would be a losing proposition.

So, show us more of your wonderful grasp on mathematics and tell how
a feedlot could manage the following:

1) Purchase an 800 pound steer for $700 minimum,

2) Feed that steer to a finished weight of about 1200 pounds,
assuming a low (by your standards) ratio of 20 to 1 for a feed cost of
$400,

3) Market the finished 1200 pound steer for $1,000 to $1,050,

4) Pay all other costs of doing business, and

5) MANAGE TO STAY IN BUSINESS!

Even if the feedlot had no expenses other than the cattle and the
feed, each finished animal would result in a NET LOSS of at least $50!
At the fuckheaded 80 to 1 ratio the two of you have previously
claimed, each animal would cost the feedlot $1,250(!) to produce the
final 400 pounds.
Your claims are the mythological nonsense of a mentally-deficient
believer in fairy-tales. Hell, I've shown it's mathematically
impossible for your figures to be correct even if the first 800 pounds
of the animal's weight cost absolutely ZERO! Not even Sue Bigot's clan
receives the amount of agricultural subsidies it would require to
remain in business if your fraudelent claims were true.
You've lost, now have the decency and good sense to admit it and
retract your pathetically stupid claims and STOP fucking with
mathematics. You're not qualified to make even the simplest
calculations.

Kevin

(1) 65.8% of 450lbs carcass, (4) 54.3% of 750lbs carcass.

Meat gain- % of liveweight gain; 111.15/358 * 100 = 31% .

(Add 10% fat content = beef 34.44% of liveweight gain.)

2.5 lbs liveweight gain x 31% = 0.77 pounds meat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As you can see, the average price per pound is well under $1.00 and

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, here's the prices for grain for the same week:

&gt;&gt;&gt; And:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.agric.gov.ab.ca/economic/stats/wkgrain.html

&gt;&gt;&gt; The price per bushel for corn is well above $2.60 which means
&gt;&gt;&gt;better than .05 per pound.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Using one of your claims of approximately an 80 to 1 ratio,

What's the cost of a ton of corn silage? $20?
(1 ton = 2,000 lbs.) 1 pound corn silage = 1 cent.
15.45 pounds silage per day = 15.45 cents, or $0.15.
The cost of medium quality hay per ton is what? $40-$50?
(1 ton = 2,000 lbs.) Hay = 2.25cents/lb = 7.4 cents/day, or $0.07.
Grain- average 10.65 lbs per day at 0.05 = $0.53 per day.
Protein supplement- ~$320 per ton. 16 cents per pound. $0.5 per day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;take more than $4.00 worth of grain to produce less than $1.00 in

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extpubs/ansci/beef/as1163-1.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.5 lbs liveweight gain x 34.44% = 0.86 pounds beef. (see above)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Average 10.65 lbs grain [excluding corn silage (the whole plant inclusive
&gt;&gt;&gt; of grain), hay, protein supplement and limestone] results in 0.86lbs beef .

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.65 / 0.86 = 12.38 : 1 - grain (excl.) : beef gain.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 12.38 * 0.05 = $0.62 grain per lb of beef gain.

&gt;&gt; OK, now add in the other costs and, if you ever learn to

&gt; http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extpubs/ansci/beef/as1163-1.htm

&gt; What's the cost of a ton of corn silage? $20?
&gt; (1 ton = 2,000 lbs.) 1 pound corn silage = 1 cent.
&gt; 15.45 pounds silage per day = 15.45 cents, or $0.15.
&gt; The cost of medium quality hay per ton is what? $40-$50?
&gt; (1 ton = 2,000 lbs.) Hay = 2.25cents/lb = 7.4 cents/day, or $0.07.
&gt; Grain- average 10.65 lbs per day at 0.05 = $0.53 per day.
&gt; Protein supplement- ~$320 per ton. 16 cents per pound. $0.5 per day.
&gt; Total - $1.25 per day. $0.50 per pound gain. (-liveweight- gain, kdb).

&gt; Are you doubting industry data? What's wrong with you, kevin?

&lt;snip the whole damn thing&gt;

I've grown tired of your bullshit equivocation between 'beef',
'liveweight', and 'dry matter'. So, let's concentrate on one crucial
issue. Support your contention that the inedible parts of beef cattle
(on a feedlot) continue to grow in direct proportion to the edible
parts. That must be your contention in order for your numbers to
remotely make sense. You have stated that a finished carcass is
approximately 35% edible beef. You have then used this figure in
determining your &quot;ratios&quot;. For this method to be correct, the edible
portion of the animal when it enters the feedlot must be approximately
35% and this figure must remain the same throughout the time spent on
a feedlot. So, support your claim by showing the following are true:

1) An 800 pound steer entering a feedlot has 35% edible beef
(about 280 pounds), and

2) a 1200 pound steer finished on a feedlot and ready for market
has 35% edible beef (about 420 pounds).

To support your claims, you need to show that both these
statements are true. Get busy.

human edible, that translates to 270 pounds (60% of 450) on a 900
pound animal or 30% AND 510 pounds (60% of 850) on a 1400 pound animal
or almost 36.5%. That's nowhere near as close at it seems because we
are interested in FEEDLOT GAIN. Out of the final 500 pounds of this
animal's weight, 240 pounds (510 - 270) or 48% (did you get that?) is
human-edible. You've failed to support your claim. In fact, you've
completely dismantled it. Note, according to information YOU provided,
almost 50% of the weight gained on the feedlot is human-edible retail
cuts. Why have you been saying otherwise?

&gt;&gt; To support your claims, you need to show that both these
&gt;&gt; statements are true. Get busy.

&gt; Neither statements are true, because you are working from a
&gt; faulty premise.

"/>  The faulty premise was yours, 46% of the weight gained on a feedlot
is processed into retail cuts. Only 30% of the weight gained prior to
entering the feedlot ultimately becomes retail cuts and the overall
percentage of retail cuts is fairly close to the numbers you have
provided. You simply did not understand those numbers and made
wild-ass assumptions rather than seek assistance from someone who is
qualified.

See table above for percentages of components.

I did and I correctly calculated the percenatge of feedlot weight
that is retail cuts. It was incredibly simple, why couldn't you do it?
But, this does bring up a related issue. Why are you assuming that
only retail cuts are consumed by humans, and why are you using only
the reatail cuts in &quot;calculating&quot; your disproven ratios? Allow me to
help you out: take a look at a diagram from one of those websites you
didn't understand. Better yet, try this one:

http://www.wsr3.com/beef.htm

You'll notice very quickly (at least you should) that several parts
of the animal are not included as parts of the retail cuts. The
reason: retail cuts are processed by a butcher from the major (or
wholesale) cuts and these major cuts come from the carcass itself.
However, the internal organs ARE NOT included among these cuts as they
are not considered part of the actual carcass. The cuts are almost
exclusively steaks, roasts, and the parts used for ground beef. You're
overlooking a lot of meat.
Let's start with the liver. Beef liver is marketed for human
consumption (although I readily admit to preferring chicken liver
myself) and is even considered a delicacy in some locales. The same
for beef tongue and a few other parts. In addition, practically all of
the remaining internal organs; heart, stomach, kidneys, pancreas,
intestines, brain, lungs...; are the main ingredients in such cheap
foods as hot dogs, potted meat, vienna sausages and many sandwich
meats. Do you see any of the internal organs listed on the webpage I
linked above? Why are they not included in your, er, calculations? Do
you think it's accurate or even honest to completely dismiss 100
pounds or more of &quot;Beef&quot; when calculating a feed to BEEF ratio?
So, now we have you overlooking all the internal organs as well as
the fact that, by information you provided, almost one-half of the
liveweight feedlot gain is processed into retail cuts. What was that
you were saying about nobody finding any errors in your calculations?
Are you now going to begin trashing the agricultural department of
South Dakota State University the way you did Tom Billings when you
realized his website didn't say what you thought it said?
Or, will you surprise us all and admit the obvious: that you are
completely ignorant of this topic and based your &quot;calculations&quot; on
false assumptions? Show enough integrity to admit to your errors and
I'll even forego any further insults (at least until the next time you
screw-up).

"/> 100°C saunas? I think you've got your units confused. 100°F saunas (38°C)
would be reasonable. 100°C would literally cook you.

"/> Maybe you should invite the whole bunch for a real sauna treat :-)

I remember once I did go to school I one day found out my gym teacher
gave me the responsibility of keeping up the fire in the sauna of
&quot;Tvedestrand kommunale bad&quot; (I doubt it exists anymore) and when the
elder people of Tvedestrand came in the afternoon to the sauna, it was
real hot. about 115 deg C (dry air). They asked my teacher to let me
do the firing the rest of the time which my teacher denied (I was very
glad he did since I had to go into the sauna to put in the logs and it
was really hot, yes. I have taken sauna some few times, but it is not
a tradition in Norway so it is difficult to find some sauna unless you
build one for yourself.

Why can't we get SPECIFIC information:

What kind of salmon are we talking about: fresh water, salt water?
Where or WHAT COMPANIES, WHAT SALMON FARMS, WHAT BRANDS ARE
CONTAMINATED - CONTAMINATED WITH WHAT AND HOW MUCH!

Can someone post this info on this site and email me?
