I know this issue is old hat, but I'm really missing the .lit format
for FBReader. Looking through the source, I see that each format is
added as a plugin. Would a plugin for .lit be possible that could be
distributed separately from FBReader, but if present could work with
it? And regarding the contributions issue, I'd gladly pay for a
commercial FBReader (or FBReader plugin) that could read .lit files on
my N8X0 &amp; 770 tablets. The only reason I ask is that I find that
convertlit doesn't really work 100% I find that in many cases zipping
up a .oebzip results in an ebook that displays the cover only or other
problems.

I'm right with you, brother.
Since the convert lit program is available,
and is apparently pretty simple, a plugin MUST be possible...

Maybe the FBReader programmers/community reject it on philosophical
grounds?

And so the format Babylon continues... :-(

Sure it's possible.  Too bad it wouldn't be legal.

I'm sure you can understand that the FBReader team is not really eager
to begin regular meetings with Microsoft's lawyers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Some, perhaps.  But for most, I'd guess it's because of the loads of
$$$ needed for a proper .lit licence, which FBReaderr lacks.

But then, you're welcome to donate those $$$, as FBReader will soon be
dual-licensed for that very reason.  Well, that and other closed
formats.

I just blame Microsoft.  It's childish, but I've done it for twenty
years and they haven't given me any reason to stop yet.

I've got the impression it's more of a pragmatic grounds.  Microsoft
have lawyers, guns and money, and don't want us to support this format.

Okay, maybe not guns.

Wow,
Okay, I didn't know the license bit.

So the &quot;convert lit&quot; program is really a hack, and coupling it with
any broadly distributed program would result in MS legal mayhem? Mega-
bummer.

I definitely don't blame ONE company for the format Babylon, but is
good to know that Microsoft, my favorite boogeyman, can share some of
the blame, anyway. Along with Sony, Adobe, and Amazon, of course. ;-)

If FBReader supports plugins, I hope the hackers will produce lit and
lrf reading plugins.

I paid for these books. I want to read them on my XO/Macintosh Air/
Kindle/iPhone!

BTW...
What do FBReader experts recommend we convert our LIT files into, for
best/easiest/most-compatible reading on the FBReader?

Convert Lit creates a folder containing an HTML file. Should I just
stop there, or would it be really advantageous to convert further? I'd
love to preserve paragraphs...

Yup.  Unfortunately, it comes with the proprietary bit.  Well, the
'closed source' bit, really.  Some proprietary formats _are_ free of
charge (like pdf).

Basically, yes, that's about it.

Heh.  People often forget to blame Corel (maybe because they're mostly
dead), but for a lot of people, it's their 'binary format war' between
Word and WordPerfect that started it all.

I'm rather annoyed with the Amazon situation.  On one hand, they really
deserve some kicks where the Sun (our Great Enemy, curse Its painful
photons) doesn't shine.  On the other hand, thanks to them, I don't have
to go all the way to Paris for a decent choice of Sci-Fi.  And they
ship free of charge.

I understand completely, and this is exactly why I will _never_ buy
anything with DRM or in a closed format: the _whole point_ of this is
to make you pay a first time for your PC, a second time for your Mac,
etc.

And of course, when the format changes and/or the DRM servers die/are
updated, if you want to still be able to read your books, you have
to pay again n times.

This may sound like a rant... okay, it _is_ a rant, this whole mail
is, but it's also the cruel, awful, very not-nice reality.

As long as the game is played like this, it'll be cheaper to just buy
the dead tree format.

I am _ever_ so thankful for Baen and their ebook policy.  I hope other
publishers will follow them.

Amen to that.  And isn't it odd that .lit is probably the most benign
closed format due to it's weak drm. As far as FBReader goes, I'd
gladly pay for a version that could read .lit as long as it runs on my
device &amp; OS of choice and is reasonably priced.

Stop there.  Nothing is going to threaten your paragraphs.

I favor an .RTF conversion myself. Retains basic text formatting but
doesn't require multiple files like html sometimes does.
As for a good converter, I find that ABC Amber LIT Converter (
http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html ) seems to work nice.
It's freeware, supports batch conversion, and output is your choice
of .pdf, .chm, .hlp, .txt .html, .rtf, .doc.
