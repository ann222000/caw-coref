Left I on the News has touched on the bogus nature of claims of "300,000 Iraqis in mass graves" many times, most extensively here . And more than a year ago , we noted: "Time after time, as in Kosovo, claims of genocide or hundreds of thousands killed have turned out to be wildly exxagerated."

And today, a little more of the truth about the mass graves of Kosovo has emerged (full story only available to subscribers): "The war crimes tribunal in The Hague is 'beginning to panic' over its case against former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic according to a Vancouver detective sent to unearth mass graves in Kosovo and a Canadian filmmaker who documented the exhumations.

"'I would think they'll have a tough time with the charge of genocide with only 5,000 bodies,' said retired Vancouver detective sergeant Brian Honeybourn. 'It seems as though The Hague is beginning to panic.'

"Mr. Milosevic's trial is to resume next week with the former Serbian dictator defending himself against charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. Former Canadian Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour made history when she laid the charges -- the first against a head of state -- as the tribunal's special prosecutor.

"Calgary filmmaker Garth Pritchard and Sgt. Honeybourn are critical of Ms. Arbour, now UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and her claims that the Serbs, directed by Mr. Milosevic, murdered as many as 200,000 civilians during its ethnic cleansing of Kosovo.

"The alleged massacres were used by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Western leaders as justification for their bombing campaign and intervention in Kosovo, and were regularly and routinely reported as fact on television networks such as the CBC and CNN, as the West backed the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) against the Serbs.

"'This was a massacre that never happened,' Mr. Pritchard maintains.

"Sgt. Honeybourn and forensic team leader Brian Strongman echoed Mr. Pritchard's doubts that the genocidal massacre by the Serbs ever took place.

"'I can't say that there weren't 200,000 bodies because I wasn't covering the entire country,' said Sgt. Honeybourn.

"'But I never saw any sign of anything like 200,000. If there were that many, then why did they have us exhuming single graves? The biggest mass grave we examined contained about 20 and there was another one of 11. But mostly our nine-member team worked on single graves.'

"In the six weeks Sgt. Honeybourn spent digging up fetid graves in Kosovo during the sweltering summer of 1999, the Canadian team exhumed 86 bodies." Just one more object lesson in not believing anything that you hear from the U.S. government or the corporate media. Their modus operandi is to demonize people and countries (Castro/Cuba, Kim/North Korea, Hussein/Iraq, Milosevic/Serbia, etc.) and then count on the American public to believe whatever swill they are fed about the demonized. Will people (like, just for a recent example, the Washington Post film reviewer mentioned in the post just below this one ) who realize they were lied to and manipulated about Iraq ever learn this lesson, and stop believing everything else they are fed? I hope so, although my confidence is low, because people who fundamentally buy into "the system" ("democracy", capitalism, imperialism) have a hard time seeing through even obvious lies because they have so much of an investment (psychological if not financial) in that system.

Three things:

First, your main point is well-taken. One must be very cautious about believing reports about atrocities carried out by all-too-convenient villains. Darfur comes to mind.

Second, a Google search for `Kosovo Mass Graves` turned up this article: Albanian bodies arrive in Merdare , which talks about 836 bodies, and this one: Serbia returns bodies of 22 ethnic-Albanian civilians to Kosovo , which mentions 3400 missing. While these numbers are a far cry from 200,000, they seem high enough to justify prosecuting Milosevic, so no reason for panic in the Hague.

Third, even an absence of mass graves could hardly be considered proof that no killings have taken place - bodies can be disposed of without the use of mass graves. Who knows how the bodies of the thousands killed in Iraq these days are being disposed of?

You're missing a few things. First, Milosevic wasn't just charged with war crimes, he was charged with genocide. Changing someone with genocide for killing a few hundred or even a few thousand people with genocide would mean that what just happened in Najaf, or earlier in Fallujah, was genocide. It wasn't (although it WAS a war crime).

Second, there was a war of seccession going on, on the part of the KLA. Most, if not all, of the bodies that are being found were either KLA fighters or active supporters. Were war crimes committed in killing civilians who supported the KLA, either intentionally or acidentally? Quite likely. Was Milosevic directly responsible, i.e., was it a policy of the government, or did it happen at much lower levels? Harder to say.

Was there a policy of "genocide" in practice? All the evidence suggests there was not.

True - that's what the court is there to do.

As I see it, the Hague court and other international institutions serve a useful function. Criticism of their flaws is, of course, legitimate, but it has to be directed at their flaws rather than at dismissing them altogether.

Legally, that's incorrect. Under international law, killing people because of their ethnicity, especially if it's inteneded to have an impact on the group as a whole, is genocide, regardless of the numbers involved.

Some are uncomfortable with that and believe that the charge of genocide should be reserved only for those cases where the death toll is such as to threaten the existence of the group (which is how we generally think of it).

Others reply that limiting it to such an extreme case effectively ends the possibility of prosecution: Even Hitler could have gotten off the hook of a charge of genocide against Jews by pointing to their presence in other countries beyond his reach and saying that therefore he was not actually a threat to their existence as a people.

Whichever side of that argument you are on, the state of law is such that the charge of genocide is legitimate. (Whether he's guilty or not is a different question; I'm referring only to the issue of the charge itself.)

On the other hand, the people killed in Najaf were almost exclusive Shiites but it was not because they were Shiites that they were killed. So what happened in Najaf, whatever else it was, was not genocide under international law.

It is rather well known since months after the war that Milosevic's latest Kosovo campaign had lesss than 5000 victims (at least in the European press, especially the German one as the Schr√∂der government back then still supported US propaganda with its own). But while I denounce the US support for the murderous KLA (which did its own reverse ethnic cleansing after the war), the bombing campaign and the following lopsided (UN civilian control, but US military control) 'international administration' were a sham, I don't think Milosevic should be out of the loop. He used the KLA as excuse for further ethnic cleansing. You don't have to kill many people to make the rest flee.

Comparing various recent claims of numbers of victims, I think there are important differences, but these point to graver errors than lying about numbers.

Look at Bosnia: exhumations and *discoveries* of mass graves continue to this day - 18,000 found, 25,000 people still missing. Last I heard, in Srebrenica alone, numbers of corpses found climbed above 6,000, nearing original claims of 7,000. And among the 100+ discovered recently in a cave near Foca, were ones to put the lie to persistent denials that camps where Bosnian Serbs held people were cruel concentration camps.

So, if there are lots of killed and there *is* a concerted effort to dig up graves, the work still takes years to decades. In Iraq, where not all evidence for genocide comes from the US govt &amp; friends, there was no such effort - the real outrage in the 5,000 number is not that victims' numbers were bloated, but that the occupying power didn't spend a cent on finding &amp; exhuming mass graves in an orderly way.

I don't know how many people Milosevic or Saddam killed, but I suspect that no one else does either. It's common for death toll statistics to be all over the map( sometimes differing by factors of ten or even a hundred)--the problem is the news media usually doesn't bother to explain whether there is good evidence for the numbers they report, and what that evidence is.
