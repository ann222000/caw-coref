Roy Torcaso, 96; Defeated Md. in 1961 Religious Freedom Case

Roy R. Torcaso, 96, whose application to be a Maryland notary public led to
a U.S. Supreme Court case that affirmed his refusal to take a state oath
requiring him to declare a belief in God, died June 9 at the Himalayan
Elderly Care assisted living home in Silver Spring. He had complications of
prostate cancer.

Mr. Torcaso, who said he was an atheist, was a bookkeeper by profession. He
worked for a Bethesda construction company when his legal challenge started
in 1959. He had been urged by his boss to become a notary public.

At the Montgomery County Circuit Court, he refused to swear to a state oath
given to notaries public that made them profess the existence of God.

&quot;The point at issue,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is not whether I believe in a
Supreme Being, but whether the state has a right to inquire into my
beliefs.&quot;

The state disqualified him and barred his commission. The Maryland courts
upheld the state constitution on the basis that Mr. Torcaso had not been
compelled to pursue the notary public designation. The American Civil
Liberties Union and the American Jewish Congress became involved on Mr.
Torcaso's side.

In a case that became known as Torcaso v. Watkins-- Clayton Watkins was the
Montgomery County Circuit Court clerk who administered the oath -- the U.S.
Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Mr. Torcaso's favor in June 1961.

The high court declared that the Maryland test for public office
&quot;unconstitutionally invades [Mr. Torcaso's] freedom of belief and religion
guaranteed by the First Amendment and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment
from infringement by the States.&quot;

Writing for the court, Associate Justice Hugo Black said neither the state
nor the federal government &quot;can constitutionally force a person 'to profess
a belief or disbelief in any religion.'

&quot;Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid
all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions
based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions
founded on different beliefs,&quot; Black wrote.

That August, Mr. Torcaso won his commission as a notary public after
swearing to uphold the laws of the state and the federal Constitution.
There was no mention of religious belief.

His first official act was to witness the application of his daughter Linda
to take an exam for a ham operator's license.

Roy Reed Torcaso was born Nov. 13, 1910, in Enumclaw, Wash., where his
parents were farmers. The son of a Catholic father and Protestant mother,
he had been a nonbeliever his entire adult life.

He served in the Army in England during World War II. Reactivated during
the Korean conflict, he learned Korean at the Army's language school and
worked as an interpreter during prison interrogations.

After his U.S. Supreme Court victory, Mr. Torcaso held a series of
bookkeeping jobs over the decades, none lasting very long. His daughter
Linda Bernstein attributed this to her father's strong personality. She
said her father was &quot;opinionated&quot; and &quot;sort of difficult, very firm in his
beliefs, or nonbeliefs.&quot;

He was an early voice in favor of racially integrating his Wheaton
neighborhood. He later organized pickets against the Rev. Jerry Falwell's
Moral Majority political organization and attended marches in favor of
abortion rights.

He was a former board member of the American Humanist Association, an
educational and philosophical group, and a former president of its
Washington chapter.

He became a humanist counselor, with the authority to officiate at weddings
in some states. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his
challenge to Virginia laws that favored ordained ministers and prevented
him from officiating at weddings there.

He also was a former Washington area president of the Hemlock Society, a
right-to-die organization, and often brought the terminally ill some of his
award-winning dahlias.

While he remained an atheist, he was a member of Unitarian Universalist
Church of Rockville. He joined about 1960 because of the Rockville church's
outspoken support for his lawsuit against Maryland's constitution when he
said others were calling him a &quot;dirty Communist&quot; and &quot;atheistic bum.&quot;

His wife of 60 years, Eileen Lusher Torcaso, died in 2006. A daughter,
Susan Mims, died in 2002.

Besides his daughter, of Philadelphia, survivors include a son, Bill
Torcaso of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother; three grandsons; and two
great-grandsons.

It has also played a significant role in helping me to expose the
plethora of radical Christian propaganda and lies that we find at
almost every media turn.
