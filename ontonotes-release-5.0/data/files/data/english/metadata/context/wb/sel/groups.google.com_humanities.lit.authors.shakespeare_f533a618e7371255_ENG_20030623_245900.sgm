Hi all,

I hate to admit it at 38 years of age, but I'm just now getting into
Shakespeare. (My education, which takes me through graduate school,
has been almost entirely science and technology.) So, I'm turning to
this group to help me get started. I know that the most basic answer
to the question &quot;How do I begin with Shakespeare?&quot; is to just pick up
a play and read. But I'd really like to get a little more information,
like answers to the following questions:

1. What plays are the best for a newbit to cut his teeth on?

2. My Dad is interested in starting, too, and we would be reading
together (perhaps even aloud). In that case, would your initial
reading recommendations be different?

3. Are there any indispensable reference books that I should own?

4. Are there are any really good Shakespeare Web sites worth
bookmarking?

5. I'm thinking about using the Folgers series because it has the
original text on one side and hard-to-understand words with their
definitions on the other side. Looks like a winning combination. Do
you agree?

6. Do you have any other tips for getting started, pitfalls to avoid,
etc?

Thank you for your help!

Patrick Barnes

I would say the early comedies and history plays. You might want to read
them in order of composition to get an idea of his progress as a playwright.

The Riverside Shakespeare is good to start out with. You can get a copy of
the second edition pretty cheaply.

Yes, a lot.   is indispensable.

There are several series of individual plays edited for general readers,
none of them bad, as far as I can tell. As long as the print is big enough
to read, it should be suitable for your purposes.

Search for Shakespeare plays in your area and go see them, even if they're
high school productions. Also rent videos and watch them in conjunction with
your reading.

Patrick, I know a number of scientists and engineers who have never
broadened their horizons beyond those topics, so I applaud you for
wanting to learn more about literature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;1. What plays are the best for a newbit to cut his teeth on?

"/>

Whichever ones interest you the most! (And your dad, since he'll be
reading the same plays.) The last thing you want to do at this point
is to lose your enthusiasm because you started with plays you &quot;should&quot;
read rather than the ones that intrigued you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. Are there any indispensable reference books that I should own?

"/>

Isaac Asimov's book is interesting, but I think you should only read
reference books if you really want more background information, not
because you think you need to read them before the plays themselves.
Again, don't scare yourself off!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

I don't have that series myself, but any good series will have the
difficult words explained somewhere nearby. It will also have some
sort of introduction to the play, which will be particularly helpful
in setting the context of the historical plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;6. Do you have any other tips for getting started, pitfalls to avoid,
&gt;etc?

"/>

As Tom suggested, you might want to watch some movies (or films of
staged plays) in conjunction with your reading. You could watch the
movie first to get the drift of the action, then read, or do it in
reverse, or intersperse them, or whatever. (Personally, I think the
films make an easier entry because the inflections and body language
help you follow what's going on even if you don't understand every word.)

Above all: have fun!

The plays being produced right now by your local professional theater,
which you should go see. (Unless you live in New Jersey, of course.)
Shakespeare wrote plays, not novels.

Seriously, it depends on your tastes. For some people, &quot;King Lear&quot;
opens the door; for others, it's &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Unless you're seriously
interested in English history, the History plays are probably not the
ones to start with -- but perhaps you are just the sort. If you like
the Three Stooges or Abbot and Costello, try &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; or
&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. If you're more into Cole Porter (or NoÃ«l
Coward -- or &quot;Frasier&quot;), you might like &quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot; -- try the
Branaugh movie. Jane Austen? &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; might be just
the thing for you. If you like fantasy, there's &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;A
Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; -- but serious fantasy fans don't always
altogether like &quot;Dream&quot;; Elizabeth's age was the beginning of the &quot;cute
and tiny&quot; image of fairies that reached its nauseating nadir in
Victoria's day; just accept it and go on with the play.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. Are there any indispensable reference books that I should own?

"/>

Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare. For the most part, it does an excellent
job of explaining all the things that Shakespeare expected his audiences
to already know, but that modern education tends to leave out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. Are there are any really good Shakespeare Web sites worth
&gt; bookmarking?

"/>

Good at what?

If you're going to be hanging around here, you'll run into the filberts
who don't believe Shakespeare wrote his own plays (though they can't
come up with a believable alternative, and fight like a bag full of
weasels amongst themselves).   is
something of a central clearinghouse for sanity here.

"/>

Twenty-five years ago, I think most people would have given them a
definite &quot;yes&quot;. They were also, in my experience, the normal starting
point for producers. I'm not sure that's so true now, but they're still
respectable, and the opposite-page notes _are_ good for beginners.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6. Do you have any other tips for getting started, pitfalls to avoid,
&gt; etc?

"/>

See the plays. On television if you must, but see them.

Learn the basics of the language. &quot;-eth&quot;, &quot;-'th&quot;, and modern &quot;-s&quot;
(example: &quot;goeth&quot;, &quot;go'th&quot;, &quot;goes&quot;) all mean exactly the same thing;
English was shifting to &quot;-s&quot; in Shakespeare's day. &quot;Thou&quot; always means
one person only; more than one is always &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Thou&quot; is also normally
the intimate form, like French &quot;tu&quot; or German &quot;du&quot;; you address it to
someone you can kiss, or someone you can kick. But that distinction was
beginning to be a bit wobbly in Shakespeare's day; don't regard it as
ironclad.

Be aware of metrical traps. The &quot;e&quot; in &quot;-ed&quot; on a verb was frequently
pronounced where we pronounce a mere &quot;-'d&quot;. (In the 18th century,
writers were careful to spell it &quot;ed&quot; if it was pronounced and &quot;'d&quot; if
it wasn't, but the habit hadn't set in yet in Shakespeare's time, and
was lost in the 19th century.) And some words were simply pronounced
differently, such as &quot;re-VEN-ue&quot; or &quot;MI-lan&quot;. Professional actors and
scholars can usually read a line of Shakespeare and get it right the
first time, but it takes years for it to become automatic.

Don't get confused by modern politics. Shakespeare believes in loyalty
to the King. That doesn't mean he's against democracy -- democracy
simply wasn't a serious option in his days, no more, say, than is
monarchy a serious option in the modern United States; what it does mean
is that he's against treason and civil war. He presents a pretty foul
picture of a Jew in Shylock; he is to be blamed for this, but that
doesn't change the fact that Shylock is, after all, nothing but a
mustache-twirling villain in a play that is, in and of itself, a
romantic comedy; the play isn't about him. &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;
isn't exactly good feminist material; but remember that Kate isn't
Everywoman; she's a spoiled child who needs some attitude adjustment.

Richard the Third is easy, short, and fun.
You have to forgive the murderous egomaniac,
but he gets his in the end. It mimics history
somewhat, by exaggerating and embellishing.
It helps you see what Shakespeare puts into a character

No, my real recommendation is to keep it up
after you've started. Read along with the video
or audio versions, and you can pause to learn,
discuss, look up words, or follow synopses.

It is not an uphill climb. Read an Act after dinner tonight. It will take
only about 1/2 an hour or so, and that's with the concordance and
the glossary. You want to get addicted, so let it rip. It is not a chore,
it is a joy. Keep notes for yourself, you'll have lots of reactions and
questions.

Hey Patrick,

Reading Shakespeare is one of the major experiences one can have as a
reader; as poet and thinker he's endlessly open to contemplation and is well
aware of what he trying to do with each play. Language is always the first
barrier to an appreciation of Shakespeare, though I think the Foldgers series
is an excellent choice, and its opening section on Shakespeare's language is
very helpful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;1. What plays are the best for a newbit to cut his teeth on?&gt;

"/>

I do not hesitate to suggest &quot;Macbeth.&quot; Ultimately it is his five major
tragedies that matter most - &quot;Hamlet,&quot;&quot;Othello,&quot;&quot;King Lear,&quot;&quot;Macbeth,&quot;&amp;
&quot;Antony and Cleopatra.&quot;&quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; are the two polar opposites of
his career - &quot;Hamlet&quot; is his longest, most intellectually difficult of his
plays while &quot;Macbeth&quot; is his shortest and most compact masterpiece. &quot;Othello&quot;
is often considered the most painful of his tragedies will &quot;King Lear&quot; is
widely recognized as Shakespeare's profoundest utterance.
Shakespeare, you will discover, is an extraordinarily *giving* writer - he
fills his great plays with gifts to the core - and cannot possible be
understood in their totality in a single reading, yet they are appreciable even
at the most superficial level of understanding.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. My Dad is interested in starting, too, and we would be reading
&gt;together (perhaps even aloud). In that case, would your initial
&gt;reading recommendations be different?&gt;

"/>

The idea sounds great! I would certainly recommend &quot;Macbeth&quot; as the piece
to begin with. Shakespeare's comedies and histories are worthy of great
respect, but ultimately, I think, they have their proper place far removed from
&quot;Othello,&quot;&quot;King Lear,&quot;&quot;Macbeth,&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. Are there any indispensable reference books that I should own?&gt;

"/>

Secondary works are just that, secondary. Ultimately it's only you and the
text. If you do wish some early help with Shakespeare, Shakespearean studies
don't get much better than Harold Bloom's &quot;Shakespeare: Invention of the
Human,&quot; but secondary texts should not limit you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;5. I'm thinking about using the Folgers series because it has the
&gt;original text on one side and hard-to-understand words with their
&gt;definitions on the other side. Looks like a winning combination. Do
&gt;you agree?&gt;

"/>

It is the one I would recommend.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;6. Do you have any other tips for getting started, pitfalls to avoid, &gt;etc?&gt;&gt;

"/>

I respectfully disagree with my fellow readers who recommend staged
performances. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the cynics who think it is
more and more difficult to find a decent representation of Shakespeare on stage
or film which does not leave me with the desire that I was someplace else.
Polanski's &quot;Macbeth&quot; has an excellent cast in its two leads and great visuals
while it also has its share of flaws. I'd certainly recommend it if you're
interested in a film version of Shakespeare.
I also disagree that one needs to see Shakespeare as a royalist or that he
does not continual transcend his time period as as thinker, usually leaving it
far behind. As I read Shakespeare, he is little interested in editorializing or
in morality; he is principally a master psychologist and poet and may be best
thought of as a precursor of Freud who presents us with the human condition in
such a manner as to allow us to see things which we would have been unable to
see without him.
If this sounds intimidating it should not. Shakespeare is fun and full of
drama easy to relate to. The only real rocky area for the beginner is the
language - &quot;Macbeth&quot; as English language poetry may very well be unsurpassable
- and that one can get used to rather quickly. Enjoy, and please let us know
what you think of your first reading.

Way wrong by my experience.
What we are seeing, hearing, and feeling is our own fellow
citizens time traveling to not only Elizabethan/Jacobean times,
but further back through Shakespeare's words to bring that
reality forward. Believe me, tens of thousands of people have
played the parts written into the Shakespeare plays, and they
are our human guides--they dared to impersonate the very
characters Shakespeare created, and they are our direct links
to the words. Yes, your barber or your banker or your neighbor
may be living a double life: as Lear or Coriolanus or Imogen!
Go to the plays and let modern everyday human beings build
your appreciation. There are no perfect presentations--take what
you can get. I see lots of free Shakespeare! Once the town of
Stratford paid the King's Men for NOT playing! Get to the
plays and think for yourself. I'll be seeing my fifth or sixth rendition
of As You Like It this summer. It's like going back to my time share
resort--I belong there. I hope to see a dozen more!

I see the usual suspects have rounded up on your proposition
so I will swing freely with my own guarded reactions. I
have reservations about some scientific types taking to
Shakespeare based on my experiences in class with some who
signed up for Shakespeare as an elective, but became
frustrated with the language and subject. This is not to
say that some with strong science backgrounds are not also
Shakespeare mavens, like an Isaac Asamov, just that their
skills, aptitudes, and analytic abilities may test out
different tollerances than the norm?

You will have problems with the modern spelling versions, be
slowed down by unfamiliar terms, metaphors, alusions, etc..
Therefore, I suggest an agenda where you and your father
read the plays alone, as &quot;closet dramas&quot; first, then discuss
the scenes and read aloud the parts you have an interest in.
Follow up might be viewing the play on video to focus on the
acting interpretations and effect on audience.

Many like the idea of getting with a group to share their

Some are real theater goers who travel to see plays and
visit new places, etc.. If you are into it, you can
probably get with an amatuer play group of some kind to
participate.

You've already gotten some excellent advice, but I can't resist the
temptation to chime in.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1. What plays are the best for a newbit to cut his teeth on?

"/>

Here's what I'd recommend: Henry IV, part 1; Twelfth Night; Hamlet -- in
roughly that order. Henry IV part 1 often gets overlooked, but I think
it's a perfect play to start out with. It's got everything: history,
comedy (Falstaff!), and a little bit of tragedy too. And no, you don't
have to read part 2 to enjoy part 1.

I would also recommend any live performances you can get to. And here's
my list of favorite Shakespeare movies of recent memory: Kenneth
Branagh's &quot;Henry V&quot; (watch this one if you never watch another);
Branagh's &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;; Zeffirelli's &quot;Hamlet,&quot; with Mel
Gibson (I know not everyone will agree with me on this one, but I think
it's an excellent way to get into the play for the first time); and the
version of &quot;Richard III&quot; that has Ian McKellen (I'm blanking on the
director's name: Locrine?). I'm also very fond of the Zeffirelli &quot;Romeo
and Juliet&quot; -- much more so than the recent Bas Luhrman effort, though
my main problem with that is nit-picky: he should've left in the swords.

Movies to avoid: anything by (or with) Laurence Olivier; and just about
anything made before 1970. Most of the BBC Shakespeare -- I mean the
regular series, not their one-at-a-time productions: the &quot;King Lear&quot;
with Ian Holm is terrific, if a little off-putting visually. Anything by
(or with) Orson Welles. Now, before I get creamed, let me explain:
Welles is brilliant. Welles' films are brilliant. I love Orson Welles.
But most of his films, even the restored version of Othello, suffer from
horrendous sound quality, and that's what you do NOT want.

Again, the goal here is INTRODUCING Shakespeare. If you were already an
avid fan / addict, the recommendations would be entirely different.

Absolutely. Look especially for the &quot;New&quot; Folger series, with copyright
dates in the 1990s or later. It's specifically designed for first-time
readers, but the editing and scholarship is outstanding. I have almost a
full set and have often used them for handy reading on the subway. (I
have most of the one-volume editions too ... each has its virtues, but I
think you're starting in exactly the right place. Try before you buy, so

Leave the Sonnets for later. Skip ... let's see, do I want to stick my

Tempest. Skip Pericles. Skip Measure for Measure and All's Well that
Ends Well. Skip like the plague Troilus and Cressida. And I have to
admit that, although many people sing its praises, I've always found
Richard II dull as dirt. Midsummer Night's Dream is an acquired taste --
oh, and also SKIP the film version of this with Kevin Kline and Calista
Flockhart and company.

All of these plays, and all of these films, have good points, but in my
opinion are best left for second or third rounds.

Wow! What a terrific series of responses from so many folks. I
*really* appreciate so many people weighing in with their answers to
my questions. (Gotta love the Internet and a friendly newsgroup.)

I am fortunate to live near a pretty thriving arts community in Iowa
City, Iowa. I recently saw Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth at
their Shakespeare Festival. Both plays were, to my thinking, superbly
done. I'll also be going to Twelfth Night on July 25. And I have seen
numerous movies. My favorites are Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing
(Branagh versions). I would LOVE to attend the Oregon Shakespeare
Festival some year.

So I've seen numerous plays/movies, but just have never read
Shakespeare for myself. Your comments and guidance for my getting
started in this is a big help, and I thank you all.

Patrick

***Start with a play that you have no preconceived notions about--something
that you won't just be skimming along remembering vague references from
elsewhere, but that will involve you in the pleasure of assessing and
understanding all on your own--something like *Troilus &amp; Cressida* or
whatever title you see in the table of contents which registers little
recognition or none with you. Your &quot;home grown&quot; reactions to this will help

Theater Review - Richard the Rare
SELDOM-STAGED POWER PLAY SENDS A TIMELY MESSAGE
By Karen D'Souza
Mercury News

ASHLAND, Ore. - In its own day, ``Richard II'' was the soul
of controversy. Indeed, the fourth act, in which the king
loses his throne, could not be performed in its entirety or
even published while Queen Elizabeth I was alive.

The play takes place in 1399, but in 1595, nearly two
hundred years later, its pointed examination of the divine
right of kings seemed incendiary. There were forces seeking
to overthrow the monarchy, and they wanted to see the play
on the boards. The queen banned it.

In any case, it has come to be regarded by many as a lesser
history play and rarely has been staged in recent years. But
this makes the Oregon Shakespeare Festival's current
production all the more intriguing.

If this show has its static patches, the tragedy still cuts
through layers of history to speak to the essence of
politics: how rulers are made and unmade. Director Libby
Appel has cast the timeliness of its central theme -- the
corruptive nature of power -- into high relief, and a core
of veteran Oregon Shakespeare Festival actors pumping blood,
life and fire launched the festival's opening weekend on an
arresting note.

Richard II (David Kelly) emerges as a mass of
contradictions. He enters as a peacock arrayed in rich
robes, a king cloaking his frailties in the rituals of the
court. Appel outdoes herself in the opening moments with a
display of pageantry basking in the grand scale of the open
air Elizabethan Stage. It's the 14th century equivalent of a
photo-op, a chance for the king to cement his status with
pomp and circumstance (which the cast carried off despite a
few technical difficulties.)

But as he indulges his taste for preening, Richard sows the
seeds of his own destruction. When he taxes the commoners
within an inch of their lives, he opens the door to
insurrection.

All his sufferings are born of his own failures. Yet
Shakespeare, never content to traffic in stereotype, takes
pains to etch the man's noble aspects as well. Richard
remains the most sensitive figure in the play, the only man
who would rather wield words than swords.

Kelly succeeds where a less nimble actor might fail in fully
motivating the king's complicated psychology, from his
callow lapses in judgment to wise reflections on the meaning
of life. The actor's subtlety is matched by Kenneth Albers'
joyfully broad turn as the Duke of York, who prizes the
sanctity of the crown above all those who might wear it.

York finds himself torn between his loyalty to his monarch
Richard and his conviction that Henry Bolingbroke (James
Newcomb), the usurper, may stand in the right on the issues.
Newcomb imbues Bolingbroke with a courageous sense of
conviction that highlights the moral ambiguities of
leadership, a motif the playwright mines famously in the
related works of ``Henry IV'' and ``Henry V.''

Ironically, the most emotionally accessible aspects of the
text are the ones that receive short shrift here. The bond
between Richard and his queen, Isabella (Linda K. Morris),
never comes across enough to lend their farewell its due
poignancy. Likewise, York's exchanges with his wife, the
Duchess (Karen Grassle), feel a bit forced. Neither Morris
nor Grassle fleshes out these women to the point that their
actions seem grounded.

Even so, there is much to admire in this ``Richard II.'' If
it's not the Bard's most seamlessly crafted play, it
contains some of the finest poetry in the canon. Ray Porter
lends considerable weight to a small role as the gardener
bemoaning the decline of the nation and Barry Kraft revels
in the beauty of Gaunt's immortal ``this scept'red isle''
speech.

Patriotism vs. propaganda in Shakespeare (as in life)
remains largely a matter of perspective. Despite Richard's
abuses, his fall from grace retains a tragic air. In one of
the production's most memorable scenes, Kelly sits in rags,
his hair shorn, his face cloaked in shadow. A lone candle
flickers on the fallen king as he stares down the jaws of
fate, a man consumed by history.

The upshot: The Oregon Shakespeare Festival launches its
summer season with a rarely staged history play, shot
through with penetrating performances and provocative themes
that speak to the present day in no uncertain terms.

&gt;this group to help me get started. I know that the most basic answer

&gt;a play and read. But I'd really like to get a little more information,

Yes. I find it almost impossible to read Shakespeare from a complete
edition. The cramped printing and broken lines completely put me off.
I tend to use the Arden - good-sized print, notes at the foot of the
page. It sounds as if the Folger shares the advantages.

See the plays acted, as much as you can. Ones you have read, ones you
have not read yet, they all produce their effect. And the effect of
acting was what they were written for. Film is only a substitute - no
cast-audience interaction.

Coming in late, I have not tried to be comprehensive, only to add the
odd bit.

Sits in Yorick's skull cave &amp; plays with his jewels?
-------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Minor Treasure Room has nothing but tons of priceless jewels made
of gold, ruby, diamonds, etc. Things to which the Phantom does not
attribute much worth. Beyond this room lies the Major Treasure Room. The
Major Treasure Room is a historian's dream come TRUE for this place
contains articles which are thought to be lost forEVER. This room holds
things from centuries past that have been either gifted to or found by
the various Phantoms over the ages:

The sword of King Arthur -- Excalibur
The sword of Roland -- Durandal
The ivory horn of Roland
The asp that bit Cleopatra
Cleopatra's wedding ring from Mark Antony
A tiny ark made from the wood of Noah's ark
A golden flower
Caesar's laurel crown
The Diamond Cup of Alexander the Great (Legend says when Alexander
wept because there were no more worlds to conquer, his tears fell into
this cup)
The great ring of Nebuchadnezzar
The necklace of Nefertiti

The original script of Hamlet in Shakespeare's own handwriting!!!!!

The lyre of the blind poet Homer
(Possibly the same one that John W. Kennedy keeps refering to!)

The Chronicles Room contains a large number of voluminous books. In
these books are captured all the adventures of the Phantoms, written in
their own hand. Thus, 400 years of events are recorded in the books of
the Chronicles Room. Here also lies answers to many unsolved mysteries.
For example, the secret of how the Goon Squad was formed. This room is
most precious to our 21st Phantom. He spends a lot of his time here
reading about his ancestors. Many a time, he has sought help from the
Phantom Chronicles in his own adventures.

The Internet Room, as the name suggests, contains a huge high-tech
computer. The Phantom uses this computer to contact the Goon Squad
urgently. There is a special band or frequency that he uses for this
which is called the G-Band at Goon Squad. The Phantom also uses the
computer to receive news broadcasts from far and wide to keep in touch
with the latest happenings. Oxfordians call his computer the 'Devil
box', from which come 'voices from air'.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The Phantom's adventures have intertwined with history. One Phantom as
a youth acted in Shakespear's troupe, another met Baconian Mark Twain.
Often, Falk uses the medium to introduce readers to classic literature.
One story, &quot;The Jungle Games,&quot; retold the Greek classic, &quot;Lysistrata,&quot;
another, &quot;Queen Samaris,&quot; paid homage to H. Rider Haggard's &quot;She,&quot;&quot;The
Rattle&quot; reflected Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels.&quot; Falk, a novelist, and
world traveler, draws upon a wealth of knowledge and experience to weave
the tales, which unfold like scenes in a play.&gt;&gt;

&gt;a play and read. But I'd really like to get a little more information,
&gt;like answers to the following questions:

&gt;1. What plays are the best for a newbit to cut his teeth on?

"/>

My advice over the past couple of years has leaned toward &quot;Richard III.&quot; It's
got a plot that's pretty easy to follow, and after exposing several newbies to
stage or screen versions, they say it's much easier to understand than they'd
thought it would be. The language isn't as ornate as some you'll encounter in
the courtly comedies or the later plays. Plus, you'll likely have a few video
versions to choose from at the local video store and/or library. [Save the BBC
Shakespeare one until you're an addict and want to go back and see the entire
tetralogy of Henry VI parts 1, 2, 3 and Richard III in sequence. They are
directed by Jane Howell and feature the same ensemble cast throughout.]

But, you've got to gravitate to what grabs you. If it's Lear, or Hamlet, or
Much Ado, that works too. I think I read Twelfth Night and Much Ado first, then
got to Hamlet.

I'd probably go with R3, Much Ado, and Macbeth in roughly that order if I were
going in fresh. Then maybe something like The Tempest and I'd have a good
dabbling in timeline and genres.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. My Dad is interested in starting, too, and we would be reading
&gt;together (perhaps even aloud). In that case, would your initial
&gt;reading recommendations be different?

"/>

Not really, though keep in mind you may have some expressions to learn. It's
hard to read aloud, enjoyably to the listener, while constantly having to
refer to footnotes to figure out what the allusion is. You might enjoy reading
along with an audio version at first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. Are there any indispensable reference books that I should own?

"/>

Get a good footnoted version that makes you comfortable. I'm partial to the
Riverside, though it's a big book to lug around. You might want to check out
individual Ardens or other paperbacks from the library for tucking into
pockets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;4. Are there are any really good Shakespeare Web sites worth
&gt;bookmarking?

I'm pretty sure someone referred you to the newsgroup FAQ. Depends on what you
want to look for. There are electronic texts online, in lots of locations.
Britannica has a pretty  .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;5. I'm thinking about using the Folgers series because it has the
&gt;original text on one side and hard-to-understand words with their
&gt;definitions on the other side. Looks like a winning combination. Do
&gt;you agree?

"/>

I haven't used them. I only know their coffee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;6. Do you have any other tips for getting started, pitfalls to avoid,
&gt;etc?

"/>

The pitfall to avoid is giving up. If it gets dull, you're treating it as
homework; change your approach. Other than that, forgetting that they are
plays, and you should make every effort to see and/or hear them. I would avoid
*starting* with Rudy's jaded notion that most film and stage versions are no
good. (Although, I agree, I have seen some dreadful duds.) Over time I think I
have learned from the bad productions as well as the good, developed my own
tastes, taken on the interpretations of others.

Accept that no &quot;Hamlet&quot; you will ever see will ever be *quite* as good as the
one you direct in your head. Unless you are very, very lucky, I guess.

By the way, you might want to check out Bob Smith's memoir &quot;Hamlet's Dresser&quot;
for inspiration. He writes of finding Shakespeare as a young person, and also
of his experiences teaching the works to classes of senior citizens.

Hope you enjoy your adventure, something of a

&quot;wild dedication of yourselves

Just one more note on beginning Shakespeare: I am an old woman who
decided to learn about Shakespeare. I found a really great way to do
it is to enroll in a junior college class where you get to really
study and discuss certain plays, and of course, Shakespeare himself,
whomever he really turns out to be. Another fun way is to enroll in a
Barnes and Noble online class. Also, Barron's Shakespeare Made Easy
(they are the yellow ones) series is really great, Shakespeare on one
side, English on the other. Also, the library is a great resource,
read a play and then the Cliff Notes. So many fun ways to access
Shakespeare. As a beginner, I thought Richard III is a hard way to
start, I didn't know enough history, you almost need to read the Henry
plays first. But Midsummer Night's Dream is fun and Much Ado about
Nothing is really fun also!

&gt; I am fortunate to live near a pretty thriving arts community in Iowa
&gt; City, Iowa. I recently saw Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth at
&gt; their Shakespeare Festival. Both plays were, to my thinking, superbly
&gt; done. I'll also be going to Twelfth Night on July 25. And I have seen
&gt; numerous movies. My favorites are Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing
&gt; (Branagh versions). I would LOVE to attend the Oregon Shakespeare
&gt; Festival some year.

&gt; So I've seen numerous plays/movies, but just have never read
&gt; Shakespeare for myself. Your comments and guidance for my getting
&gt; started in this is a big help, and I thank you all.

Richard III is Shakespeare's first achievement that announced here was a
poet of considerable power. But a beginner should be warned the names and
family relationships can be rather tricky to keep all in one's head especially
since the characters are not nearly as individuated as they are in his later
plays. The play continues to be very popular thanks to the super-Marlovian
Richard but I find it to be a very minor play indeed.

There are always at least thirteen or fifteen characters to learn

What is that supposed to mean?
They never met. Richard preceded him.

That alone turned me away from any possibility Marlowe wrote Shakespeare.

It is a cheap shot for you to relate that here as some known reality. It ain't.
Richard III is a textbook Shakespeare play. I'm not surprised that I'm not

How would you know? You suggest people avoid plays.
Please name better soliloquies! Please name a more dramatic

If two contemporaries are BOTH inspired by

Spell chekkers be damned, but we're asking for a play to
*begin* with, not a masterpiece, though I personally think
Othello and Macbeth are overrated by tradition and neither
expresses as complete and audacious and futile a character
as does Richard III, which is more important in Elizabethan
times in that it is a history--and a direct means of learning
England's vital royal lineage. (I love Lear and A&amp;C and can't
argue against them as glorious works, the same status as R3.)

You did not name the (great number of better) soliloquies
so I don't know if you know of any better than Richard's.

Bye then.

See you at the plays... whoops, you discourage that.

Are you satisfied with telling Paddy not to attend plays? How
do you know a production is unworthy without being there?
What was so good about the one(s) you attended?

Just asking because you said,
&quot;I respectfully disagree with my fellow readers who
recommend staged performances. Unfortunately, I
have to agree with the cynics who think it is more
and more difficult to find a decent representation of
Shakespeare on stage or film which does not leave
me with the desire that I was someplace else&quot;
and I always say
&quot;a bad night at Elizabethan theater is better than a
great night at a computer.&quot;

Of course a decent representation is difficult to find if
you go someplace else so if you or someone else would
like to restate that in a more coherent fashion I'll certainly

Perhaps. I think you are on your &quot;attack mode&quot; setting, and wish it

&gt;&gt; They have my pity, rather than my hatred.

&gt; When they start accusing legitimate scholars of intentional academic

&gt; deserve hatred or institutionalization, either one or t'other. If they

But why grant them so much attention? Scholars don't.

Yes, John,
this is the sole objective of Spam (what a stupid pseudonym)
Scone -- to cause trouble here, to put people at odds and to sit diabolically
in his underwear laughing at how chaotic he can make things. He has a history
of causing mayhem on usenet. That's why he has to call himself Spam (what a
stupid pseudonym) Scone -- because his own name has been trashed by his
own behavior and he needs new dumb identities just to hide his own past.

I scalded Scone/Spam/Tart/Globule before because he IS a bully misogynist.
It is his claim to fame to flame on usenet. He is stinging bigtime ever
since I exposed his malicious persona. He chose HLAS to bother again
so we will suffer through his antics as he kisses up to those he considers
popular. He has often insulted people here only to take it back
or lessen his charge in an attempt to try to fit in, the phony.

Lousy strategy for a jackass who fancies himself a chess player where
you don't get your moves back. He involves himself not in our topic
but in the personalities ongroup, so he has misjudged and apologized
before (Neuendorffer and Farey and then I filtered the jackass just to
lose track of his misguided flippancies).

Calling himself spamscone and tartakover sound overtly gluttonous
so as to keep in step with his gluttonous need for attention here. Gluttony
causes depression, but I don't know why he targets me except that I
showed his online history as predator/bully, and now as messenger-killer
as he attempts to somehow injure me.

We need real discourse with real people who use their own real
names instead of phonies naming themselves after fatty foods
including tarts and scones, or after nutritionless stuffs such as Spam.

Here's how he operates in this recent example from HLAS (though it
is the same MO he has used before at other newsgroups)....

When I called out Rudy Caine regarding his advice to
not attend plays, Rudy truncated the conversation like so...
&gt; rudyca ... @aol.com (Rudy Caine) wrote in message news:
&lt;20030626220008.07323.00001 ... @mb-m22.aol.com&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I can't respond to any of your other comments.
&gt;&gt; If you or someone else would like to restate them in a
&gt;&gt; more coherent fashion I'll certainly take a look at it.

Since Rudy is promoting the nonattendance of Shakespeare plays
for some reason, I'm well within the spirit of this forum to go
delving to learn how it is he feels that way.

Then...
Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone, hiding his damaged
usenet identity due to his chronic bullying of women and his schlocky
tactics, shows he cannot understand the discussion but since he's still
burned silly by my tattling on him, wrote:

&gt; Writing in a coherent fashion is a skill missing from the skill-set
&gt; owned by Troll Reynolds. It is the role of Troll Reynolds to attempt
&gt; to flame all newcomers to HLAS,

A true strategist such as a chess player would understand the situation
before making such a reckless move, but this is no chess player, he's
a phony.

Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone, the glutton for attention,
is wrong of course because I do not flame newcomers AND
Rudy Caine is not new here, having posted here since 2001, when Spam
(what a stupid pseudonym) Scone was making enemies on other
newsgroups which you'll find easily in Google but you need to use
his name and not his stupid pseudonyms, the phony.

My own business with Rudy is way over Spam (what a stupid
pseudonym) Scone's head, so he needs to butt out. What, is he
agreeing people ought to avoid Shakespeare plays or not? He just wants chaos.
I filter him as do many who have encountered his disruptive tactics in other
forums. His real name is associated with people telling him off and trying to
avoid him and warning him to stop the cheap charades, abuses, and mischief.

I don't have time to rip him a new one every time he calls me names
or lies about my statements or my motives. We're here for our
dedicated subject matter so I use the readily available remedy for the
problem of a lying phony who disrupts my newsgroup.

&gt; as well as to write hundred-line lying
&gt; posts responding to people he's allegedly killfiled.

Only the phonies, Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone.
I tolerate the idiots and the jerks, but not you phonies. Picking fights
is not contributing.

&gt; One of his recent newsgroup turns was to dispute a claim that he
&gt; called another poster a &quot;hate-monger&quot;.

Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone would see I did not
dispute it if he could read and/or think. My interrogation was not a
declaration, he ought to realize, except he wants to jab at me for
being the one who exposed his ugly past for the benefit of our
readership.

He is a jackass to have joined forces with Richard Kennedy's
quest for Emily Posting (whimpering about etiquette when
true detail is all that matters here). He speaks in platitude
only.

&gt;When he was confronted with a
&gt; quotation supporting the claim

Typical attack from Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone
who'd rather disrupt newsgroups than learn anything.

[How can I be &quot;confronted&quot; by my own words when I stand by them?
These ARE my argument, not some defeat of my argument. Spam (what
a stupid pseudonym) Scone is so hateful of me he gets it all mixed up--not
the mark of a true chess player but the mark of a phony.]

&gt; Troll Reynolds advised us all that his
&gt; use of the phrase &quot;hate-monger&quot; was justified, so it shouldn't count!

Stop cluttering our newsgroup with your platitudes.
Don't try to interpret my words. They stand as written.

&gt; Truth is but putty in his hands; fortunately for Truth it doesn't stay
&gt; long with Reynolds.

A phony calling me a Troll suits me just fine.
That's why I filter him and pay regard to the rest of this group.

If dueling were legal, Spam (what a stupid pseudonym) Scone would
not have survived the other newsgroups he has disrupted with his
hoaxes, his picking on women, his crossposting to find other groups
to gang up on women, his phony identities needed to disguise his
disgraces on usenet, his kissing up to the side he thinks is winning,
his obsessive Emily Posting, and his dopey apologies to those he
has attacked when real correspondents set him straight.

Greg Reynolds

Sorry for such a clerical post; the parasite used my name in vain
to make himself look better. Lying that I flame newbies or that
Rudy is new to HLAS are just careless moves a strategic chess
player would not attempt. That's why I filter Spam (what a stupid
pseudonym) Scone off my screen. I don't need a lying bully
misrepresenting my words or my intent at HLAS. Look up his
former identities at Google if you want to see a disruptive pest
at work. Put up with him if you want--I don't need it.

&quot;Stop feeding off me&quot;

Snip hundred or so lines/lies from Troll Reynolds, who allegedly
killfiled me but manages to type detailed responses to my posts.
Please note Troll ducked the matter of his denying he used the term
&quot;hate-monger&quot; towards Richard Kennedy, and then attempting to weasel
out by claiming the use of the term &quot;hate-monger&quot; was justified. Troll
forgot, if that is the word, that the question was purely one of
holding him responsible for his own words - did he write &quot;hate-monger&quot;
or not? I fully understand Troll not wanting to establish a precedent
in this area.

&gt;Just one more note on beginning Shakespeare: I am an old woman who

&gt;it is to enroll in a junior college class where you get to really

I think it's terrific that you have begun this process. I have gotten to know
two retirees who have turned to studying literature or writing in their
retirement, and both of them have backgrounds in engineering and science. It's

&gt;As a beginner, I thought Richard III is a hard way to

What's to know? (Shakespeare veered from history anyway). An ambitious prince
wants to wear the crown, but must bump off his brothers, and a whole flock of
relatives and in-laws, first.

Ultimately, you're right, the cycle is not complete without knowing the full
sweep of Henry VI and the other tetralogy, but Richard III, to me, stands alone
just fine, and even without much sense of the actual history.

My advice to you is to start off by reading A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
and ROMEO AND JULIET. I think you should also purchase the Cliff's
Notes to both of these plays. Read an Act or a scene in the play and
then turn to Cliff's Notes to read the summary and the commentary.
This will help you understand the play better and begin to get a sense
of the way Shakespeare wrote. These are both very good and popular
plays and there is an enormous amount of information found on the
internet that you will find useful. After reading the play I suggest
you rent the movie or go see a live production of the plays that way
you will get a visual image of the play and begin to better understand
Shakespeare. Best of luck to you!!

Many have recommended the histories. I'd keep away from them initially. The
characters are VERY hard to follow - they are frequently known by multiple
names, family affiliations are complex, etc. Go with the comedies or tragedies
for starters.

&gt;Get a good footnoted version that makes you comfortable. I'm partial to the

&gt;individual Ardens or other paperbacks from the library for tucking into

Several people have recommended the Ardens. They are the best, but not
necessarily for beginners. They're indispensible for serious students,
directors, etc., but sometimes they forget to gloss the &quot;easy&quot; words, and
spend a lot of time on publishing history, etc.
