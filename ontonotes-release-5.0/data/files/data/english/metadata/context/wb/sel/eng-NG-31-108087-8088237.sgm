THE LAND OF SANDRA DEE

By Leland Waldrip

Long ago and far away, In a land that time forgot,

Before the days of Dylan Or the dawn of Camelot.

There lived a race of innocents, And they were you and me,

Long ago and far away In the Land of Sandra Dee.

Oh, there was truth and goodness In that land where we were born,

Where navels were for oranges, And Peyton Place was porn.

For Ike was in the White House, And Hoss was on TV,

Tab Hunter was our heaven In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We longed for love and romance, And waited for the prince,

And Eddie Fisher married Liz, And no one's seen him since.

We danced to &quot;Little Darlin'&quot;, And sang to &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;

And cried for Buddy Holly In the Land of Sandra Dee.

Only girls wore earrings then, And three was one too many,

And only boys wore flat-top cuts, Except for Jean McKinney.

And only in our wildest dreams Did we expect to see

A boy named George with Lipstick In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We fell for Frankie Avalon, Annette was oh, so nice,

And when they made a movie, They never made it twice.

We didn't have a Star Trek Five, Or Psycho Two and Three,

Or Rocky-Rambo Twenty In the Land of Sandra Dee .

Miss Kitty had a heart of gold, And Chester had a limp,

And Reagan was a Democrat Whose co-star was a chimp.

We had a Mr Wizard, But not a Mr T,

And Oprah couldn't talk yet In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We had our share of heroes, We never thought they'd go,
At least not Bobby Darin, Or Marilyn Monroe.

For youth was still eternal, And life was yet to be,

And Elvis was forever, In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We'd never heard of Microwaves, Or telephones in cars,

And babies might be bottle-fed, But they weren't grown in jars.

And pumping iron got wrinkles out, And &quot;gay&quot; meant fancy-free,

And dorms were never coed In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We hadn't seen enough of jets To talk about the lag,

And microchips were what was left at The bottom of the bag.

And Hardware was a box of nails, And bytes came from a flea,

And rocket ships were fiction In the Land of Sandra Dee.

Buicks came with portholes, And side shows came with freaks,

And bathing suits came big enough To cover both your cheeks.

And Coke came just in bottles, And skirts came to the knee,

And Castro came to power In the Land of Sandra Dee.

We had no Crest with Fluoride, We had no Hill Street Blues,

We all wore superstructure bras Designed by Howard Hughes.

We had no patterned pantyhose Or Lipton herbal tea

Or prime-time ads for condoms In the Land of Sandra Dee.

And middle-aged was thirty-five And old was forty-three,

And ancient were our parents In the Land of Sandra Dee.

But all things have a season, Or so we've heard them say,

And now instead of Maybelline We swear by Retin-A.

And they send us invitations To join AARP,

We've come a long way, baby, From the Land of Sandra Dee.

So now we face a brave new world In slightly larger jeans,

And wonder why they're using Smaller print in magazines.

And we tell our children's children Of the way it used to be,

Long ago and far away In the Land of Sandra Dee.

It's all bullshit, really. A fallacy.
Segregation, George Wallace, lynching's.
We were all under the terror of the cold war and the possibility of a
nuclear winter. And then Kennedy was assassinated.

Remember the drop drills in school? Or the fallout shelters. I still see the
old air raid siren's around. Not all of them have been removed.

In 1963 the military built a Nike, nuclear missile base right in front of
the high school I was eventually going to attend. They would raise and lower
the missiles on a daily basis.

Not much difference between then and now, except then a spade was a spade
and a pot could call a kettle black. In his older years, my dad would say,
&quot;He was a fag wasn't he?&quot;. Women were not considered equal to men and thusly
were treated so.

I prefer tolerance, actually.

Mororcyclists are lumped together in one sweeping generalization, by most

Not really. The guy who's making the honest observation is the one who
admits out front that he's speaking of an individual's actions.

The racist is the guy who judges an entire race by the actions of a few, and
then tries to cover his ass by saying &quot;I'm just being honest; you know it's
true&quot;.

Wasn't there some kind of turtle character used in nuclear
war educational films... something about &quot;duck and cover&quot;?

On the wall of my elementary school wall was a sign
with large black letters:

IN CASE OF ATOMIC ATTACK
ALL STUDENTS WILL TAKE COVER UNDER THEIR DESKS
AND NOT EMERGE UNTIL ADVISED BY THEIR TEACHER
THAT IT SAFE TO DO SO.

In 1955 one quarter of the city of Calgary was evacuated
as a drill. Thousands of people were herded out onto
the bald prairie and fed from portable soup kitchens.

Every neighborhood had a tall pole with an air raid
siren. One day ours went off accidentally and we all
anxiously scanned the sky for fleets of Soviet bombers
(I suppose this was about as clear on the concept
as going down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in).

Well, no Ilyushins with big red stars on the rudders appeared.
OTOH we didn't see any RCAF interceptors rising to meet
them, either. At the time we didn't know that they were
being shot down by our own Prime Minister:

Hmmm.  Mainly Americo-centric, so I guess it's not bullshit if you

Besides, it's easy to judge people of the past by today's standards.

History does not record anywhere at any time a religion that has any rational
basis. Religion is a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up to the
unknown without help. But, like dandruff, most people do have a religion and
spend time and money on it and seem to derive considerable pleasure from
fiddling with it.

I went to a private school. Instead of &quot;duck and cover&quot; we did
evacuations because the place had the reputation of being a serious
firetrap. When we had a big quake up here in '57, we managed to
evacuate the two story mansion in under two minutes.

We were woken up periodically by sonic booms from the F104s practicing
to intercept Russian bombers, the defence department having failed to
realize that the USSR intended to go forward with missiles.

There were some improvements over what had gone before. Until 1948,
interracial marriage was prohibited in the US, for example. And when
HUAC came out west to hold hearings in San Francisco, there were
riots, and they never again held hearings west of the Mississippi.
Indeed, the committee was dissolved a few years later.

And there was more tolerance for some things. Eisenhower could have a
woman on the side, and nobody thought anything of it, but when Clinton
got a blow job, well, you recall what happened.

When I was a sophomore in high school we were pulled out of class one day
and herded into the assembly hall where we were shown a propaganda film of
the San Francisco &quot;riots&quot; with the voice-over telling us that the
demonstrations were the result of communist agitators; and concluding that
the nation was within a hair's-breadth of violent revolution.

Turned out that the school principal was a big McCarthy fan who had procured
the film and ordered it shown to the student body without the approval of
the school board, with no notification of parents, and against the fervently
expressed wishes of the teaching staff, who were locked out of the assembly
hall while the film was screened.

The principal was eventually given an early &quot;voluntary&quot; retirement.
