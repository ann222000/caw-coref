I might mistakenly expect a reply back from you.

If you're not going to be a friend, don't ask about me. It's none of your
business.

Really?

I have made a few good friends on the net; some that actually stopped by my
home to visit while going thru my area, some that will email me with the
latest happenings in their family or just to tell me about some stupidity I
may have missed in this group. Those are the folks I miss from this group.
But when someone only wants your email just to be nosey, they are not a
friend. Those are the ones that need not bother to check on me because I
don't post much any more. I've got more fun things to do that read this NG,
like going fishing, working on my old motorscooter or watching the Arches
National Park erode.

And from the recent discussions I've seen, the stuff being posted would have
got me yelled at if I'd posted it. IOW, nothing but the same crap that was
here the last time I was subscribed. And it's coming from the ones that
yelled at me . . . . . . ROTFLMBO!!!!

Sometimes paybacks come with patience . . . .

See ya, I'm outta this cesspool.

How about your true enimies?

I guess your comments are directed to me.  I just wanted to know if
you were alright since you suddenly stopped posting here. I doubt that
there will ever be any great friendship between the two of us but that
doesn't mean that I wish you any harm either.  Yes this newsgroup has
changed over the years, partly because new people have joined and
partly because some of the old timers here have left.  It would be
nice if the latter would just poke the noses in here every once and
awhile and say hey.

And if you really gotta know - my dad, who is 85 and is loosing his
mind,  is takeing up a lot of my spare time.  Dr says he is healthy
and should live a good deal longer which means I am going to have my
hands full for awhile.  I don't really mind as it is a labor of love,
and it does take priority over most everything else in my life at the
present time.

My point is simple. If you're a friend, I figure you'll answer a question in
the reply about how you're doing. Takes all of a minute or so. Denny and
Gary G have both done so, for example. If you don't, then IMHO, you're just
being nosey.

I'm not one to bug others with nosey emails, I only ask for the same
respect.

How about I just have someone post the funeral notice a month or so after
I'm gone? Till then I'll be in whatever health I have at the time.

No it's not Bud.  There is alot of garbage on usenet in general.  I
first came here about 5 years ago and there were far more bitching and
pissing contests then.  You just have to learn to ignore them
completely.  Telling idiots to leave you alone is pointless.  Why
respond to people who aren't your friends?

Miles, I give everyone a chance, and often a second thru twentieth chance.
I've never asked for more than that for myself. This world is too full of
strife and hate already to not try to gain a bit of peace in our lives. I
had thought to give it another try with a few from this group when I was
emailed with questions concerning my health, but I was in error.

That's why I answered non-friends. Oh, well, their loss, not mine.

My sewer comment is based on the fun there used to be in the group 10 years
ago combined with the accuracy of information available then. Now it's
flames and misinformation. Hey, if no one else cares, fine, why should I?

&gt; No it's not Bud.  There is alot of garbage on usenet in general.  I
&gt; first came here about 5 years ago and there were far more bitching and
&gt; pissing contests then.  You just have to learn to ignore them
&gt; completely.  Telling idiots to leave you alone is pointless.  Why
&gt; respond to people who aren't your friends?

Because the reliability of dodge trucks have improved, not much to talk
about. The toyota news groups are nothing but political banter and personal
agendas for the last 8 years. This is what happens when the cars run like
they should. If you want mechanical talk, check out Audi and BMW news
groups.

Budd,  you're a good guy.  You just need to learn to ignore, meaning
don't even respond to the crap that permeates usenet.  I started out
messaging on FidoNet which was a hobbiest network before the Internet
became public.  Once things went public anything and everything wanders
in.  So you just have to ignore the trash.  The good people are still here.

Miles that is your interpretation of the attitude. Seeing as you participate

It not just the volume of info that's down, but the quality, with persons
with no or little mechanical background acting as if their word should be
gospel.

Anyway, I've said my piece. After today, I'm not replying any more. I've got
a Cushman motorscooter calling me . . . or is that the fishing hole I hear?
