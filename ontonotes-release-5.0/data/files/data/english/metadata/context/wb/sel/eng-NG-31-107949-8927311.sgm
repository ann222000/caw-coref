I'm looking at getting a road/commuter bike. I want disc brakes (for
the rain) and drop handlebars. I don't want to spend more than
$1,000.00. My target right now is the Schwinn Super Sport DBX. There
are some 2006's still available. My problem is I can't tell if I need
a small or a medium frame. I'm about 5'7&quot;. I have an 18&quot; Yukon Giant
MTB and I think it's just a touch big. Any idea what frame size would
be best? I don't really have an opportunity to ride one.

Disc brakes on a road bike are all hype. Put some Kool-Stops on
whatever calipers you get and you'll stop just fine. Discs limit your
ability to mount fenders and racks which are far more important on a
commuter.

I'd recommended a touring bike like the Jamis Aurora or wannabe
cyclocross bike like the Bianchi Volpe.

Seriously, those disc brakes are more trouble than they're worth on a
road going bike. Linear pull brakes or cantilevers are more than
powerful enough, cheap, and decrease the theft value of your bike. The
reason you see them on so many so-called &quot;commuters&quot; is fashion,
nothing else. They certainly are useful for when you're bombing down a
northwest soggy trail at at 30mph, but I doubt that's what this bike
will see. ;-)

If you're planning on traveling light and your terrain is flat, I
can't recommend a Redline 925 fixed/ single speed bike enough. Nuclear
blast proof, and only $500. Yes I'm biased, as I own one, but it's
insane. I ride it road and trail, through glass, over curbs, and it
begs for more.

It's all about reach. Measure your virtual top tube length on your
current bike and adjust for whether you find it cramped, stretched, or
just right.

Thanks. that sounds like a useful approach. My current bike has
straight bars, and I am looking to go to drops. Is there any
adjustment needed to the virtual top tube length? Drops seem to extend

Well, you're a Mac user, so I guess you need a bit of a handicap--but
I've been commuting near twenty years rain and dry with caliper
brakes, and they work fine.

If this is your first road bike with drop bars, I would definitely recommend
against buying one without riding first. There are a whole lot of things
that go into proper fit on a road bike, and getting one set up properly will
save you a lot of grief (and possibly a lot of money if the original idea
didn't work out and became a very expensive garage decoration). Even if it
means traveling a pretty good distance to find a shop that can help you out,
it could very well be worth it. Once you're dialed in and all, buying bikes
without test rides will be a lot less risky (although still an issue).

Especially for the price range you're talking about, there will be benefits
to having a good shop standing behind not just the fit, but the assembly and
any warranty issues that might come up as well.

Is there some reason you're looking at a compact frame? For most riders,
a compact frame is a very bad idea.

As one major bicycle manufacturer wrote: &quot;there's a disturbing trend
among some bike companies to re-tool their road frames by shortening the
seat tube and slanting the top tube down from the head tube. This new
design &quot;breakthrough,&quot; they argue, saves frame weight. And if you take
their claim literally, they're right - a shorter seat tube does make a
bare frame a little lighter. What they don't tell you is that their
complete bicycle actually weighs more than a bike with a conventional
geometry. Why? You have to use longer (and therefore heavier) seatposts
and stems on smaller frames to fit the rider properly, and their added
weight more than off-sets the few grams saved by their sloping top tube
frames.&quot;

Disc brakes are rare on road bikes, as they really are unnecessary, even
in rain, but if you've got your heart set on disc brakes on a road bike
look at the Novara Element, &quot; http://www.rei.com/product/744808# &quot;

With the REI dividend it'd be under $1000. Get an REI Visa card first,
and save another 5%. Or wait for a sale, as often REI has 15-20% off on
Novara bicycles (no dividend but the 5% for the Visa card still applies
on sale items).

If the size isn't right, REI gives you no trouble on exchanges,
something that is not the case at most other bicycle retailers.

That's bullshit. Just ride a properly sized compact and you can avoid
using a bunch of spacers or stupid stem dohicky to get the bars at a
comfortable height.

You might think a flat top looks better--but please, stop with the
bullshit to back up your &quot;faith&quot;. The problem is that people buy
frames too small, whether it be sloping top tube or not.

There _is_ a tendency for shops toe sell frames that are too small.

It has nothing to do with looks.

You need to understand the inherent disadvantages in the compact frame
geometry for the vast majority of riders that are of &quot;normal&quot; proportions.

Compact frames are to save the manufacturer money. They've tried to
convince people that they're better (or at least no worse) than standard
geometry frames because there's a big monetary incentive. Don't fall for
it! There are still a sufficient number of non-compact frames available,
so you don't have to do whatever the bicycle manufacturers want you to do.

For $1000, you don't have to compromise with a compact frame.

That one is also in my sights. It looks like a great bike. However, I

It's not my first road bike. My first one was run over by a pickup
truck when it hit me. I was young and stupid, and riding on the wrong

We need to differentiate between &quot;compact&quot; frames, which might allow a
manufacturer to cut back on the number of sizes, and &quot;sloping top tube&quot;
bikes, which do little more (good or bad) than allow someone with
shorter-than-normal legs to fit a given-sized bike (if that person simply
chose a smaller size, the issue would be the top tube becoming too short).
Beyond that, it's style points.

If you look at what Trek did with the '08 Madone lineup, they essentially
doubled the number if size options when they went to a sloping top tube.
Almost every model they make is available with either a standard head tube
height (as used on all prior Madones and every other Trek &quot;racing&quot; bike
they've made since 1992), which is called the &quot;Pro&quot; fit, or the exact same
frame (by exact, I mean every single dimension, angles, chainstay length,
everything) with a 3cm taller head tube, called the &quot;Performance&quot; fit.

Not one size (50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62cm for men's) was dropped, and in
fact they added a 64cm in some models.

Other manufacturers may or may not have done something similar. My point is
that, just because it has a sloping top tube and someone decides to call it
a &quot;compact&quot; frame, has nothing to do with limiting sizing options. Could
even be the opposite.

I'd wait for an REI sale or coupon. They often send out 20% off coupons
for one item, and while it excludes most bicycles, it doesn't usually
exclude Novara bicycles. Add that to their 5% Visa rebate, and it's down
to $836 versus $700.

In any case, you said $1000, so that's why I came up with the best $1000
bicycle I could find. Remember, you're going to have this bicycle a long
time (hopefully), so you'll forget about a $200 difference soon enough.
Run like hell away from any compact frame road bicycle.

Inventory is unquestionably a nightmare. To cover all the sizes, models &amp;
colors available is simply impossible; a retailer must try to balance the
needs of their own customers with the correct available product. But sizing
is not an area where corners should be cut, at least not if you give more
than lip service to the idea that people come in more variations that small,
medium &amp; large.

Giant did try to eliminate a whole lot of sizes by claiming that their
innovative compact design allowed more flexibility for fit. Dealers loved
it, at least initially, because they could stock so much less inventory,
*and* it gave customers the idea that sizing was no more difficult for
buying a road bike than socks. But ultimately market forces (and
intelligence) won out and people recognized that frame &quot;height&quot; was no more
important than effective top tube length (&quot;effective&quot; meaning the distance
forward from the bottom bracket).

People are reasonably adaptable; the need for 1cm frame height increments is
generally recognized as wasteful (added complexity with little benefit). But
3cm increments is probably the limit, with the issue often being that the
reduction on available sizes yields too great a difference in top tube
length.

Sounds like the best of both worlds to me: the manufacturer offers as
many sizes as anyone could want (short of a custom frame) and compact
sizing (and the concommitant availability of long seatposts and more
stem sizes) allow for smaller frame inventories, if that's what the shop
desires.

For my part, I see compact sizing from the perspective of a used-bike
trader: fewer frame sizes means a greater chance that a given used bike
will fit a given buyer.

&gt; That's bullshit. Just ride a properly sized compact and you can avoid

">

You could eliminate spacers if the compact frame had a longer headtube
than a flat top with the same top tube length (measured horizontally),
but with most compacts I think you'd need to buy a custom geometry
to get that.  For the compact frames I looked at when I bought my
last bike, when I picked the compact frame size with the top tube length
I prefer I found the head tube was almost exact the same length as my
other bikes, with few exceptions (the Trek Pilot might have been one).
The one I bought (a Gunnar Sport) has the same stem angle and number
of spacers as my horizontal top tube bikes, and the same cockpit length,
it just has more seat post showing.

Certainly if you are willing to ride a bike with a longer top tube
you'll be able to get by with fewer spacers, but this is equally true
whether the top tube slopes or not.  To reduce the stack of spacers
you would need a longer head tube relative to the horizontal top tube
length, and the standard geometries of the sloping tube bikes I've
looked at mostly don't provide this.

Personally I don't care much about the slope of the top tube, nor
the height of the stack of spacers (except that the latter is limited
if the steerer isn't steel).  I just don't think that the standard
geometry of most sloping top tube bikes is designed to achieve want
you want.

If I had followed this advice six years ago, I would have failed to
buy the best-fitting and most comfortable and reliable bike I've ever
owned.

People come in all different shapes, sizes, builds, proportions. The
availability of more different approaches to frame design only
increases the probability that anyone can find the perfect fit.

Some manufacturers may use compact frames as a way to sell less for
more. So condemn those manufacturers, not the design, because other
manufacturers use the same approach to make better-fitting road bikes
available to people who once had to accept more uncomfortable
compromises.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm looking at getting a road/commuter bike. I want disc brakes (for

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; $1,000.00. My target right now is the Schwinn Super Sport DBX. There
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some 2006's still available. My problem is I can't tell if I need
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a small or a medium frame. I'm about 5'7&quot;. I have an 18&quot; Yukon Giant
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MTB and I think it's just a touch big. Any idea what frame size would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be best? I don't really have an opportunity to ride one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there some reason you're looking at a compact frame? For most riders,
&gt; &gt;&gt; a compact frame is a very bad idea.

&gt; &gt; [drivelsnip]

&gt; &gt; That's bullshit. Just ride a properly sized compact and you can avoid
&gt; &gt; using a bunch of spacers or stupid stem dohicky to get the bars at a
&gt; &gt; comfortable height.

&gt; You could eliminate spacers if the compact frame had a longer headtube
&gt; than a flat top with the same top tube length (measured horizontally),
&gt; but with most compacts I think you'd need to buy a custom geometry
&gt; to get that.  For the compact frames I looked at when I bought my
&gt; last bike, when I picked the compact frame size with the top tube length
&gt; I prefer I found the head tube was almost exact the same length as my
&gt; other bikes, with few exceptions (the Trek Pilot might have been one).
&gt; The one I bought (a Gunnar Sport) has the same stem angle and number
&gt; of spacers as my horizontal top tube bikes, and the same cockpit length,
&gt; it just has more seat post showing.

&gt; &gt; You might think a flat top looks better--but please, stop with the
&gt; &gt; bullshit to back up your &quot;faith&quot;. The problem is that people buy
&gt; &gt; frames too small, whether it be sloping top tube or not.

&gt; Certainly if you are willing to ride a bike with a longer top tube
&gt; you'll be able to get by with fewer spacers, but this is equally true
&gt; whether the top tube slopes or not.  To reduce the stack of spacers
&gt; you would need a longer head tube relative to the horizontal top tube
&gt; length, and the standard geometries of the sloping tube bikes I've
&gt; looked at mostly don't provide this.

&gt; Personally I don't care much about the slope of the top tube, nor
&gt; the height of the stack of spacers (except that the latter is limited
&gt; if the steerer isn't steel).  I just don't think that the standard
&gt; geometry of most sloping top tube bikes is designed to achieve want
&gt; you want.

I can recommend it.  It is the bike I commute on in California so, these
days, it gets more mileage than my other bicycles.

I do have a list of tiny things I wish were different on the bike:

- The pump peg is too fat, and too low on the headtube, to be useful
for the frame-fit pumps I have.

- Fenders fit best on a bike with standard reach calipers if the
brake pads are close to the bottom of the slot.  On my Gunnar
they are about half way up, which makes it a bit tight under there.

- There's only one eyelet on each rear dropout, which means if you
mount both a rack and a fender it is hard to do it in a way which
lets you remove either without effecting the other (this is probably
only a problem of my own making; I have both, but I like to
remove them if I won't be needing them).

- I wish the hole in the chainstay bridge was threaded.

I actually went to the shop with the intention of buying a bike with
a Soma frame, but the Gunnar was on sale and it looked so pretty
that I let the salesperson up-sell me.

I usually use Michelin 25mm tires, but Conti 28mm tires from my other
bike (1mm taller) do fit under 35mm SKS mudguards, just barely.  I suspect
Planet Bike mudguards might not work since they seem to need a bit more
space under the brakes than SKS.

The extra 3 or 4 mm space you get with other frames certainly makes
everything less fiddly.  It might not be necessary to qualify what fits
by brand.

Every bike I've ever had has been in more than one crash. The
likelihood of some sort of crash is IMO fairly high, sooner or later,
for a daily urban bike commuter. Since even many CF fork manufacturers
hedge on the subject of whether a CF fork should be replaced after a
crash, this is a degree of uncertainty I'm not willing to accept on a
commuter. I have steel forks on all my bikes. There's no rust. because

I have more forks with rust on them than I have forks that I have
crashed. I've had one noteworthy MVA in six years of commuting (not
counting a ludicrous incident in which I did a low-speed berf into the
back of a car, doing no damage to bicycle or car). The one incident
didn't write off the steel fork, though the frame did need realignment.

Of course, I usually get my commuters at garage sales or from other
people's trash piles, so they sometimes come pre-rusted.

Seriously though, I'd say that while there are lots of decent pro/con
arguments to CF forks on commuter bikes, crashing should be a rare
enough event (and at-fault crashing so much more so) that I'm not going
to pick my commuter bike fork for its crashworthiness.

Rust, on the other hand, that I'm sure I'll be dealing with.

Sorry, I should have addressed this in my last post. Aside from the fact
that fender/rack-mounts are hardly excluded by the design of a CF fork,
the sport of cyclocross offers plenty of all-rounder CF forks that have
(removable) canti posts and fender/rack mounts. I did a 5-second search
(googled &quot;carbon touring fork&quot;) and found a CF-bodied CX fork with
mid-mounts (!) on eBay.

Here's an assembled tourer with the same features:

http://www.veloeuropa.com/products/framesets/rando_photos.html

As it happens, the Nashbar fork on my Nashbar X-framed CX bike has no
mid-mounts, but does have a disc brake mount. Fender mount? But of
course.

In fairness, now that I've spent a couple of posts rubbishing others for
not liking this, I have to admit that for most commuter bikes, rust on
the fork legs is just not a big deal. The rust on my rusty forks has all
started where the paint was scratched off, or on the 20 year old forks,
maybe near the drain holes and some chrome pitting or similar.

Unless you ride in an especially corrosion-prone area, you probably
shouldn't use that as a consideration. There's about 20 parts on a bike
that are more likely to be damaged by corrosion than the fork.
