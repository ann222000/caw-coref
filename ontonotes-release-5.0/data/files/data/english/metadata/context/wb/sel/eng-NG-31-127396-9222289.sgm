Interview With Mian Nawaz Sharif (2005)

Note: I conducted the following interview with Pakistan's deposed
Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif in April 2005. He was then based in
Jeddah, the Red Sea port city of Saudi Arabia. This interview first
appeared in three parts in M.J. Akbar’s multi-edition The Asian Age
newspaper. — Siraj Wahab, Jeddah

JEDDAH, April 16, 2005 — It has been nearly five years since Nawaz
Sharif flew from Pakistan to exile in Saudi Arabia. Mystery shrouds
him. Where is he living? What is he doing with his life? Is he
planning a comeback? From his base at the Red Sea port city of
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Sharif makes frequent visits to the Kingdom’s
various cities where his supporters sometimes catch a glimpse of him,
but not much more. Hardly a day passes without some function or
another for the thousands of Pakistanis living in Jeddah — but
without Sharif. The Pakistani government’s representatives to Saudi
Arabia do not officially acknowledge him. But Sharif spends most of
his time at his headquarters in Soroor Palace, off Madinah Road in
the very heart of Jeddah. There, surrounded by high walls and vast
gardens, he lives a comfortable life in what was once the residence
of King Faisal, Saudi Arabia’s third ruler. Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz has instructed that the palace is to be at
Sharif’s disposal for as long as he is there.

Sharif is indeed in exile, but he is by no means a prisoner. He
receives guests daily. Invited to dinner one night last week, I
provided the exact spelling of my name to one of his close aides and
appeared at the palace’s secure entrance at 7 pm with my official
identification. After confirming my identity, I passed through the
gate. To my right was the guest house Shahbaz Sharif had used before
he moved to London. A little further along was the palace, a rare
triumph of Arabian architectural style amidst Jeddah’s concrete
austerity.

For a first-time visitor, Soroor Palace is overwhelming. Immediately
beyond the entrance is a huge hall, furnished with large sofas and
hung with enormous twinkling chandeliers. The marble floors are
partially covered with oriental rugs. In one corner hangs a framed
photo of Sharif and Crown Prince Abdullah, taken in happier times.

The hall where Sharif receives guests was full of people. Some were
Sharif’s assistants and domestic staff, others were well-wishers or
party workers. Sharif, in a fresh white Pakistani suit, rose from his
place to welcome every new visitor. His greeting was warm and his
smile genuine, even for those he had not met before. Guests were
shown to their seats before Sharif returned to his. Even before
Sharif sat down, a secretary was whispering in his ear. Another aide
handed him a telephone. A servant went round the room several times
pouring Arabic coffee for the guests as Sharif continued with
business. Finally, he turned to his son, Hussain, seated to his
right, and quietly made a final comment. Then he called for an aide
to start reading the political columns. First, the aide listed the
available selections and made notes of important news items. Then
Sharif made his choices. The aide had already marked important
paragraphs in each piece, and he now read them aloud.

Comments by Pakistani Opposition parties were of course highlighted.
One particular story caught Sharif’s attention — about North Korea’s
nuclear armament. The story said the North Koreans were coming up
with a new kind of missile that would deactivate incoming enemy
missiles. Sharif wondered how effective even Patriot missiles are,
recalling how many Patriots were supplied in 1990 to the Gulf War
allies of the United States and how many of those failed to work. He
wondered whether the world was being made any safer by these missile
races. Then the aide recited a famous couplet by Pakistan’s national
poet, Iqbal, quoted in one of the columns. Everybody burst into &quot;wah,
wahs,&quot; but Sharif sat still and did not join the chorus. Once the
hall quieted, the reading of the columns continued.

Far from being out of touch with Pakistani politics, Sharif these
days has more time than ever to read about it, and also gets first-
hand accounts of the situation at home from visitors to Saudi Arabia.
His phone never stopped ringing that evening, although he was
selective in what calls he took. It is obvious that Sharif is still
popular and widely admired. But the personal rivalry with Pervez
Musharraf will keep him out of Pakistan for the time being. Despite
that, as demonstrated in the last elections, Sharif’s vote base has
remained steady.

Once the review of current affairs was completed, the conversation
turned to more distant history. Sharif has an enviable knowledge of
the history of the subcontinent. He remembers in detail the
backgrounds of many rajas and Mughal rulers. In response to comments
from some of the guests about the burial places of various emperors,
Sharif rattled off a list of the Mughal emperors, where they were
born and buried and a few titbits about each of them.

The next day, we met in his study where he spoke at length about
issues facing Pakistan, his time in jail and exile, his recent
meeting with Benazir Bhutto, Kargil, Indo-Pak ties and &quot;the turncoats
who now surround Musharraf.&quot;

Excerpts from the interview:

Q: You have been away from Pakistan for a long time. In your absence
how do you view the political situation in the country?

A: Yes, I have been away for more than four years and although they
say out of sight, out of mind, things have gone in our favour. The
opposition to Pervez Musharraf is now stronger than ever before,
although he tries his best to restrain our party. Our members are
implicated in all kinds of false cases. Musharraf has used his
agencies extensively for this purpose. Our people showed great
courage when they fought the elections of 2002. We got quite a large
number of votes. Given the circumstances, my expectations were much
lower than what we actually achieved. Musharraf barred many of our
leaders from contesting the elections. He even pressurised the
election commission not to accept the papers of many of our
candidates. Overnight, he promulgated an ordinance which prevented
Benazir Bhutto from contesting the elections. Her nomination was
rejected. Once her papers were rejected, I also withdrew my papers in
protest to express my concern for national solidarity. And then he
didn’t allow me, he didn’t allow Benazir Bhutto, he didn’t allow
Shahbaz Sharif nor my wife to come to Pakistan to campaign during the
elections. Despite our absence, our party did well in the elections,
and ever since our position has become stronger and stronger.

Q: How long will the Musharraf government last?

A: I am not a fortune-teller and therefore I can’t really make any
predictions. It is a question that you should be asking a jyotishi
who might be able to tell you how long his government is going to
last. (Laughs) But let me tell you, his position is not very sound
now and he has problems all over. For some of these problems he
himself is responsible because he believes in taking cudgels with
everybody. His motto is to solve all problems through force. He
perhaps doesn’t believe in sitting across the table with people and
sorting matters out. You see, when he went to India (Agra), he made a
mess of himself which prompted Mr Vajpayee to comment: &quot;Woh bahot hi
badqismat mezbaan hoga jiska mehmaan Musharraf hoga (The most unlucky
host is the one whose guest is Musharraf).&quot; So your question was...

Q: How long will...

A: ...the Musharraf government last? Yes, so I don’t know, but I
think things around him are very bad today, and the sooner he
realises, the better for him and also for the country. I now see
disturbances all over. There is a lot of dissatisfaction among the
people of Pakistan. Look at Balochistan. Look at the Northern Areas.
Look at the tribal belt in the Frontier Province, Waziristan and
other places. Look at what is happening in Sindh and Punjab. Look at
the unprecedented rise in unemployment, poverty and inflation. There
is a complete breakdown of law and order. The writ of the government
is becoming weaker by the day. And his coalition of the very
divergent vested interests is falling apart. People are vociferously
and openly talking about their rights and civil liberties. And then
of course what we have recently learned about certain people’s
demands. These demands were really unheard of in the past. Only
dictatorship in the country or military rule would give rise to these
kinds of sentiments. Under a democratic set-up or under a political
government, this would never happen. In a democratic set-up, whenever
such feelings are expressed they would be handled politically. We
lost East Pakistan because we had dictatorship in Pakistan. Had there
been democracy at that time we wouldn’t have lost it. It was people
like Yahya Khan who mishandled the situation. It was people like
Yahya Khan who never accepted the mandate of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,
who was the legitimate elected leader of the country — both East
Pakistan and West Pakistan. It should have been left to him to
decide. He had the mandate to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Yahya Khan never accepted that, and then he tried to solve the matter
by force, and look what happened. Pakistan was dismembered. Again if
we try to solve matters by similar means, we will have more and more
problems on our hands.

Q: What is the deal with Benazir Bhutto?

A: There is no deal between me and Benazir Bhutto. Of course, we both
are part
