They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish to be part of

Sorry, but everybody in the world doesn't automatically get
Constitutional protection.  It's not the Constitution of the World,
it's the US Constitution.   The Constitution begins with &quot;We the
People of the United States&quot;.  Not &quot;We the People of the World&quot;.

All we ask is that if you're going to come into the country, sign the
damn Guest Book on your way in.  Why do you have such a problem with
that?

Look, it's very simple.  The open border crowd hates the United
States.  We all know that.  They hate our form of government, and the
end goal is to get as many illegals into the US as possible to, in
effect, eliminate our border.  They are already pushing for social
programs for illegals, and the next step will be voting rights for
illegals.

giving those rights and priveleges to everyone in the world.
They were giving them to the citizens of the United States.  You must
remeber learning about a littel something called &quot;slavery&quot;.  Slaves were
brought into
this country, and were not given the protection of the Constitution or the
Bill of Rights.  They were not embued with the luxury of being citizens.
Those who enter this country illegally are not embued with citizenship.  We
owe them nothing....no jobs, no education, no medical benefits.  If they
want
those things, let them earn it by becoming citizens.  It is not a lot to ask
for everything they will gain in return.

&gt;Try to do them proud.

As you would do, by allowing illegals, terrorists, etc into the country?  I
think you have a very sick and perverted view of what this country stands
for.

First of all, we're talking about illegal aliens.  Terrorists, murderers,

They were not granting rights and privileges at all.  They were

Again.  The drafters did not think that they were *giving* rights to

I'll type slower so you can understand.  Illegals (who for the most part
aren't terrorists) are already here.  Even people who have plans and
resources to prevent them from coming have been unable to stop them.
Certainly, my permission or failure to grant such can have no effect.

Once the illegals are here, they are entitled to the protection of the
Constitution.  They have the rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights,
for instance.  They have the equal protection of the law.  Everybody under
our jurisdiction has these rights as a consequence of their own humanity,
and they have these rights protected as a consequence of our system.

To fail to understand why this is just and proper is to utterly fail to
comprehend our system of government.

Note that this has nothing to do with whether we should provide medical
care, welfare, or education to illegals.  That's an ethical question, not a

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything. They

&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the system

&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing, then
fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal question is
whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.  And the answer is
yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your analogy is flawed.  It's more like someone comes into my house to do
the chores I don't want to do, like cleaning the bathrooms and preparing
meals, all for less than the prevailing wage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You can't seem to get your mind around the concept that he *has* the same
rights as my family because he's as human as any member of my family.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;benefitted&quot; means &quot;almost wiped out by disease and having one's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country forcibly annexed&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiians ruled their own country until 1898.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt; So, it was *their* *own* *country* until we annexed it.  By force.

&gt; No force was used.  You need a new source of information.

Please enlighten me.  Also, do you have any sources on how the grateful
Indians gave their lands away?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't know the meaning of the word &quot;work&quot;.

Perhaps.  But you know nothing about what work I've done or will do, nor
what work I've been willing to do or am willing to do.  In any case, the
discussion isn't about my &quot;worthiness&quot; at all.  Illegal immigrants do
dirty jobs under lousy conditions for low pay.  I'm guessin' these are
tough jobs you won't do.  It's just a guess, but how'd I do?

&gt;   No

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So the history of this country's immigration is another topic about which

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to illegal immigration is to not provide illegal's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but everybody in the world doesn't automatically get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitutional protection.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Everybody *within the jurisdiction* of the Constitution

&gt;&gt; Whose jursidiction is the United States and it's citizens (i.e. legal
&gt;&gt; citizens).

&gt; Wow!  Does it hurt to be that ignorant?  The jurisdiction of the US is the
&gt; *territory* where its laws apply, and the law applies to just about
&gt; everybody on that territory, citizens and aliens (legal or illegal) alike.
&gt; Excluded are classes of people like foreign diplomats.

&gt;&gt;  gets
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitutional protections of their rights.  That's because one has
&gt;&gt;&gt; rights because of one's membership in the human family,

&gt;&gt; Where did you get that one?

&gt; Do you know anything about the history of this country and its founding?
&gt; &quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, ....&quot;  Sound familiar?

&gt;&gt;  not as a grant from the state.

&gt;&gt; And since the constitution is the charter of the state, how is it not
&gt;&gt; granted by the state?

&gt; The single most important concept in our governmental system, and you
&gt; missed it.  Our &quot;charter of the state&quot; is set up to restrict government
&gt; from violating those rights that all human beings have because they're
&gt; human beings.  How could you not know this?  Were you asleep in civics
&gt; class the day they covered this?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not the Constitution of the World, it's the US Constitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Constitution begins with &quot;We the People of the United States&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not &quot;We the People of the World&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Preamble is merely a remark about the makers of the Constitution.

&gt;&gt; You make a comment like that, and expect to be taken seriously?

&gt; When you're such a colossal ignoramus, it's not a wise idea to tell others
&gt; they're not taken seriously.

&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt; drafters were not referring to themselves when they penned
&gt;&gt; &quot;We, The people...&quot;.  they were referring to a nation.  A group of
&gt;&gt; individuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Can't you even read to the end of a sentence?

&gt;&gt; Apparently he cannot read at all

&gt; Here.  Let me quote it for you.  I'll leave out some of the big words so
&gt; you can follow:

&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt; We the People of the United States, ... do ordain and establish this
&gt; Constitution for the United States of America.
&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; Get it now?  You see, &quot;We ordain and establish&quot; means &quot;We wrote the
&gt; Constitution.&quot;  It doesn't say &quot;We wrote the Constitution and it applies
&gt; only to us.&quot;

&gt;&gt; All we ask is that if you're going to come into the country, sign the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damn Guest Book on your way in.  Why do you have such a problem with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't.  The problem I have is with xenophobic ignoramuses like
&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself who can't seem to understand our system of government and
&gt;&gt;&gt; our relationship to the state.

&gt;&gt; So you believe there should be uncontrolled access to the borders?

&gt; Please find anything in my posts where I advocate that.

&gt;&gt; Do you like being stupid?

&gt; You're this ignorant of your own government, and you have the nerve to
&gt; call
&gt; me stupid?

&gt;&gt; m of government, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end goal is to get as many illegals into the US as possible to, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effect, eliminate our border.  They are already pushing for social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programs for illegals, and the next step will be voting rights for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it is xenophobic ignoramuses like you who hate our form of
&gt;&gt;&gt; government, who don't understand civil rights.

&gt;&gt; It is not a civil rights issue.

&gt; Of course it is.  You even say so in the next sentence.  They [illegals]
&gt; &quot;do not deserve equal treatment under the law.&quot;  But in our system of
&gt; government, they absolutely do.  Everyone should get equal treatment under
&gt; the law.  That doesn't mean they get to stay if they're caught, and it
&gt; doesn't mean they're not breaking the law by being here.  But,
&gt; nevertheless, the rights and protections of the law apply to them as well
&gt; as to us.

&gt; Why do you hate America so much?

&gt;&gt; It is a matter of security.

&gt; Our history tells us that the best security is obtained by requiring the
&gt; state to respect people's rights. All people's.

&gt;&gt; Terrorists, murders, drug dealers, etc, do not deserve equal treatment
&gt;&gt; under the law. They do not obey the law, they disrupt the order and
&gt;&gt; security of th the country, they bring murder and mayhem.  Let them
&gt;&gt; come and live in your heighborhood.  You'll regret it when your
&gt;&gt; children get killed in the crossfire.

&gt; First of all, we're talking about illegal aliens.  Terrorists, murderers,
&gt; and drug dealers also come from the ranks of citizens.

&gt; Nothing I've said means I'm against the prosecution and punishment of law
&gt; breakers.  But Constitutional rights belong even to criminals.  Do you
&gt; know
&gt; *anything* about how this country works?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're a small, frightened person.

&gt; Which, I see, you don't deny.

&gt;&gt; And you are an ignorant person...

&gt; Maybe.  But I'm right about the application of the law to illegal
&gt; immigrants.

&gt;&gt; to remember that this country was founded by
&gt;&gt;&gt; brave folks with a far-reaching vision of the proper relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt; between people and the state.

&gt;&gt; They were not granitng rights and provileges to terrorists, drug
&gt;&gt; dealers, illegal immigrants, etc.

&gt; They were not granting rights and privileges at all.  They were
&gt; *protecting* those rights and privileges.  Do you really not understand
&gt; how
&gt; and why our country came about?  If not, why not find out?  It's an
&gt; inspiring story (no matter how short our founders fell from perfection).
&gt; Maybe their story will allay some of your fears.

&gt;&gt; They were talking about
&gt;&gt; the citizens of the *UNITED STATES*.  Illegals, terrorists, etc are
&gt;&gt; not *CITITZENS OF THE UNITED STATES*.  You fail to see the
&gt;&gt; fundamental flaws in your logic.  The drafters of the Constitution
&gt;&gt; were not giving those rights and priveleges to everyone in the world.
&gt;&gt; They were giving them to the citizens of the United States.

&gt; Again.  The drafters did not think that they were *giving* rights to
&gt; anyone. They thought that only God granted those rights and that He
&gt; granted
&gt; them to everyone.  They thought that they were setting up a system that
&gt; *protected* those rights.

&gt;&gt; You must
&gt;&gt; remeber learning about a littel something called &quot;slavery&quot;.  Slaves
&gt;&gt; were brought into
&gt;&gt; this country, and were not given the protection of the Constitution or
&gt;&gt; the Bill of Rights.

&gt; Much to our shame.  But you'll search the Constitution in vain for any
&gt; justification for that.  And you'll notice that we eventually fixed the
&gt; situation.  You might check out the phrases &quot;due process&quot; and &quot;equal
&gt; protection.&quot;

&gt;&gt; They were not embued with the luxury of being
&gt;&gt; citizens. Those who enter this country illegally are not embued with
&gt;&gt; citizenship.

&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?

&gt;&gt; We owe them nothing....no jobs, no education, no medical benefits.

&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?  We're talking about the protections
&gt; of the Constitution and the law.
">

You claimed otherwise.  You claimed that the Constitution applies to
everyone in the world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And jobs and medical benefits are not generally provided by the government
&gt; under our system.

They are for the illegals....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If they want
&gt;&gt; those things, let them earn it by becoming citizens.

The vast majority have no intent of becoming citizens.  They enter the
country illegally, send their money out of the country without paying taxes,
use our medical, social and educational systems without contributing to
them, and then disappear wheh asked to provide proof that they are in the
country legally (such as a work or education visa).

It is not a lot

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; to ask for everything they will gain in return.

&gt; Fine.  Let them.
">

But the vast majority do not, and have no intent of doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;Try to do them proud.

&gt;&gt; As you would do, by allowing illegals, terrorists, etc into the
&gt;&gt; country?  I think you have a very sick and perverted view of what this
&gt;&gt; country stands for.

&gt; I'll type slower so you can understand.  Illegals (who for the most part
&gt; aren't terrorists) are already here.

Does not justify allowing it to continue....

&gt;&gt; inspiring story (no matter how short our founders fell from
&gt;&gt; perfection). Maybe their story will allay some of your fears.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were talking about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the citizens of the *UNITED STATES*.  Illegals, terrorists, etc are
&gt;&gt;&gt; not *CITITZENS OF THE UNITED STATES*.  You fail to see the
&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental flaws in your logic.  The drafters of the Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt; were not giving those rights and priveleges to everyone in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world. They were giving them to the citizens of the United States.

&gt;&gt; Again.  The drafters did not think that they were *giving* rights to
&gt;&gt; anyone. They thought that only God granted those rights and that He
&gt;&gt; granted
&gt;&gt; them to everyone.  They thought that they were setting up a system
&gt;&gt; that *protected* those rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You must
&gt;&gt;&gt; remeber learning about a littel something called &quot;slavery&quot;.  Slaves
&gt;&gt;&gt; were brought into
&gt;&gt;&gt; this country, and were not given the protection of the Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt; or the Bill of Rights.

&gt;&gt; Much to our shame.  But you'll search the Constitution in vain for
&gt;&gt; any justification for that.  And you'll notice that we eventually
&gt;&gt; fixed the situation.  You might check out the phrases &quot;due process&quot;
&gt;&gt; and &quot;equal protection.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were not embued with the luxury of being
&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens. Those who enter this country illegally are not embued with
&gt;&gt;&gt; citizenship.

&gt;&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?

&gt;&gt;&gt; We owe them nothing....no jobs, no education, no medical benefits.

&gt;&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?  We're talking about the
&gt;&gt; protections of the Constitution and the law.

&gt; You claimed otherwise.  You claimed that the Constitution applies to
&gt; everyone in the world.

&gt;&gt; And jobs and medical benefits are not generally provided by the
&gt;&gt; government under our system.

&gt; They are for the illegals....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chose to come here illegally and by doing so accepted the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the system
&gt;&gt;&gt; owes under the law.  And in that context, you're the one who's wrong.

&gt;&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

&gt; Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing, then
&gt; fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal question is
&gt; whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.  And the answer is
&gt; yes.

They were forced to give up their land.

three hour lunches and 5 coffee breaks.  We went to work, did our jobs, and

If the illegals are not allowed in, either of two things will happen:L

1.  The jobs won't be filled, and won't get done. This indicates the
relative unimportance of the job in the first place.
2.  The jobs will be doine by legal citizens, probalby at a higher cost.
The benefit would be that the folks doing the work woudl be paying taxes,
earing
a legal wage, and contributing to the systems that they require.

If you cannot understand how either scenario is preferable, then I fele
there no hope, short of surgery, to remove your rose colored blinders.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It is doing quite well, considering we have had a very dry year.  Had some
really nice tomatoes tonight...golden crowns.
Also had some chives form the garden for our baked potatoes..although I have
to admit the potatoes were store bought.
The potatoes were from a local farm, where there are no illegal immigrants
working.  Mostly high school kids studying agriculture.
You know, the knidn of kids that will grow up, get jobs, and contribute to
this great nation instead of sucking it dry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; illegal's anything...no schooling for their kids, no medical

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; be part of theis country, and reap the rewards of being a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but everybody in the world doesn't automatically get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitutional protection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Everybody *within the jurisdiction* of the Constitution

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whose jursidiction is the United States and it's citizens (i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legal citizens).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow!  Does it hurt to be that ignorant?  The jurisdiction of the US
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the *territory* where its laws apply, and the law applies to just
&gt;&gt;&gt; about everybody on that territory, citizens and aliens (legal or
&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal) alike. Excluded are classes of people like foreign
&gt;&gt;&gt; diplomats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  gets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitutional protections of their rights.  That's because one has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rights because of one's membership in the human family,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where did you get that one?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know anything about the history of this country and its
&gt;&gt;&gt; founding? &quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, ....&quot;  Sound
&gt;&gt;&gt; familiar?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  not as a grant from the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And since the constitution is the charter of the state, how is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not granted by the state?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The single most important concept in our governmental system, and you
&gt;&gt;&gt; missed it.  Our &quot;charter of the state&quot; is set up to restrict
&gt;&gt;&gt; government from violating those rights that all human beings have
&gt;&gt;&gt; because they're human beings.  How could you not know this?  Were you
&gt;&gt;&gt; asleep in civics class the day they covered this?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not the Constitution of the World, it's the US Constitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Constitution begins with &quot;We the People of the United States&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not &quot;We the People of the World&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Preamble is merely a remark about the makers of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You make a comment like that, and expect to be taken seriously?

&gt;&gt;&gt; When you're such a colossal ignoramus, it's not a wise idea to tell
&gt;&gt;&gt; others they're not taken seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drafters were not referring to themselves when they penned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We, The people...&quot;.  they were referring to a nation.  A group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can't you even read to the end of a sentence?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently he cannot read at all

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here.  Let me quote it for you.  I'll leave out some of the big words
&gt;&gt;&gt; so you can follow:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; We the People of the United States, ... do ordain and establish this
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution for the United States of America.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Get it now?  You see, &quot;We ordain and establish&quot; means &quot;We wrote the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution.&quot;  It doesn't say &quot;We wrote the Constitution and it
&gt;&gt;&gt; applies only to us.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All we ask is that if you're going to come into the country, sign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damn Guest Book on your way in.  Why do you have such a problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't.  The problem I have is with xenophobic ignoramuses like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself who can't seem to understand our system of government and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our relationship to the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you believe there should be uncontrolled access to the borders?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please find anything in my posts where I advocate that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you like being stupid?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're this ignorant of your own government, and you have the nerve
&gt;&gt;&gt; to call
&gt;&gt;&gt; me stupid?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; m of government, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end goal is to get as many illegals into the US as possible to, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effect, eliminate our border.  They are already pushing for social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programs for illegals, and the next step will be voting rights for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it is xenophobic ignoramuses like you who hate our form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government, who don't understand civil rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not a civil rights issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course it is.  You even say so in the next sentence.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt; [illegals] &quot;do not deserve equal treatment under the law.&quot;  But in
&gt;&gt;&gt; our system of government, they absolutely do.  Everyone should get
&gt;&gt;&gt; equal treatment under the law.  That doesn't mean they get to stay if
&gt;&gt;&gt; they're caught, and it doesn't mean they're not breaking the law by
&gt;&gt;&gt; being here.  But, nevertheless, the rights and protections of the law
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to them as well as to us.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you hate America so much?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a matter of security.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Our history tells us that the best security is obtained by requiring
&gt;&gt;&gt; the state to respect people's rights. All people's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Terrorists, murders, drug dealers, etc, do not deserve equal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment under the law. They do not obey the law, they disrupt the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order and security of th the country, they bring murder and mayhem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let them come and live in your heighborhood.  You'll regret it when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your children get killed in the crossfire.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, we're talking about illegal aliens.  Terrorists,
&gt;&gt;&gt; murderers, and drug dealers also come from the ranks of citizens.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing I've said means I'm against the prosecution and punishment of
&gt;&gt;&gt; law breakers.  But Constitutional rights belong even to criminals.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know
&gt;&gt;&gt; *anything* about how this country works?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're a small, frightened person.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which, I see, you don't deny.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And you are an ignorant person...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe.  But I'm right about the application of the law to illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to remember that this country was founded by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brave folks with a far-reaching vision of the proper relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between people and the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were not granitng rights and provileges to terrorists, drug
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dealers, illegal immigrants, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were not granting rights and privileges at all.  They were
&gt;&gt;&gt; *protecting* those rights and privileges.  Do you really not
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand how
&gt;&gt;&gt; and why our country came about?  If not, why not find out?  It's an
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspiring story (no matter how short our founders fell from
&gt;&gt;&gt; perfection). Maybe their story will allay some of your fears.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were talking about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the citizens of the *UNITED STATES*.  Illegals, terrorists, etc are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not *CITITZENS OF THE UNITED STATES*.  You fail to see the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental flaws in your logic.  The drafters of the Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were not giving those rights and priveleges to everyone in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world. They were giving them to the citizens of the United States.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again.  The drafters did not think that they were *giving* rights to
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone. They thought that only God granted those rights and that He
&gt;&gt;&gt; granted
&gt;&gt;&gt; them to everyone.  They thought that they were setting up a system
&gt;&gt;&gt; that *protected* those rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remeber learning about a littel something called &quot;slavery&quot;.  Slaves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were brought into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this country, and were not given the protection of the Constitution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or the Bill of Rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Much to our shame.  But you'll search the Constitution in vain for
&gt;&gt;&gt; any justification for that.  And you'll notice that we eventually
&gt;&gt;&gt; fixed the situation.  You might check out the phrases &quot;due process&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;equal protection.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were not embued with the luxury of being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens. Those who enter this country illegally are not embued with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizenship.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We owe them nothing....no jobs, no education, no medical benefits.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course not.  Who claims otherwise?  We're talking about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; protections of the Constitution and the law.

&gt;&gt; You claimed otherwise.  You claimed that the Constitution applies to
&gt;&gt; everyone in the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And jobs and medical benefits are not generally provided by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; government under our system.

&gt;&gt; They are for the illegals....

&gt; Cite?  You think the government runs the California ag business and the
&gt; shape ups outside the Home Depot?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If they want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those things, let them earn it by becoming citizens.

&gt;&gt; The vast majority have no intent of becoming

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to the mexican invasion is simple. Every city

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overnight and it won't cost a thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now all you need to do is convince sober, intelligent people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of that. Good luck with that, champ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to illegal immigration is to not provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; illegal's anything...no schooling for their kids, no medical

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; be part of theis country, and reap the rewards of being a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chose to come here illegally and by doing so accepted the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system owes under the law.  And in that context, you're the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

&gt;&gt; Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing,
&gt;&gt; then fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal question
&gt;&gt; is whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.  And the
&gt;&gt; answer is yes.

&gt; Okay, then you are prepared to post a citation verifying this?
&gt; Simply tell us where in the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, it
&gt; states that we would provide free medical, educational and social
&gt; programs for all illegal immigrants in this country.
">

Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Nowhere have I said that
illegal immigrants must be accorded free medical care.  What I have said is
that illegal immigrants are accorded most rights protected by the
Constitution.  Certainly this excludes those specifically reserved for
citizens, like the right to vote.

The Bill of Rights is phrased so as to restrict government (1st - &quot;Congress
shall make no law ....&quot;).  Individuals are never identified as citizens but
as people (4th), persons (5th)  or the accused (6th).

Also note that Plyler v Doe (1982) extends right to a public education to
children of illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt; intent. They do not indtend to abide by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, laws and regulations that govern this country.  They do so
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowingly, willfully and with intent.

&gt;&gt; They certainly do.  But this action does not deprive them of the
&gt;&gt; protection of the law once they're here.

&gt; The point is that they should not.  They are not citizens. They have
&gt; no intent of becoming citizens.  They give nothing back.
&gt; If you have access to a dictionary, I encourage you to look up the
&gt; word &quot;parasite&quot;; paying particular attention to those that suck
&gt; the life out of their hosts.
">

None of this is germane to the topic.  Whether they should be here or not,
all people, legal or illegal, have the protection of the law, including the
Bill of Rights.

But have you heard of IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act?  This
nifty little piece of legislation from 1986 provides penalties for
employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.  Its main effect has been to
increase the production of fake IDs, including bogus social security
numbers.  Of course, the money collected under these numbers is never paid
out.  According to the SSA, the money is worth at least $5B a year to
social security and $1.5B per year to medicare.  The chief actuary for the
SSA figures about 3/4 of the bogus numbers belong to illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, Americans have become too lazy and demanding to do work
&gt;&gt;&gt; they see as degrading.

&gt; Many have.  Yet everyday, I see Americans doing hard, menial labor.
&gt; Many because they do not have skills to do anything but.
&gt; Yet they do it.  My generation grew up in different times.  We didn't
&gt; look at work as a bad thing.  We didn't want 4 day work weeks and
&gt; three hour lunches and 5 coffee breaks.  We went to work, did our
&gt; jobs, and paid the bills.
&gt;&gt; So what's your solution if we need these jobs done?  Seems bashing
&gt;&gt; illegal immigrants wouldn't be to your advantage.

&gt; If the illegals are not allowed in, either of two things will happen:L

&gt; 1.  The jobs won't be filled, and won't get done. This indicates the
&gt; relative unimportance of the job in the first place.
">

Sure.  Check out the recent panic in the meat-packing industry when the
feds tried to crack down on illegal immigrants.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2.  The jobs will be doine by legal citizens, probalby at a higher
&gt; cost. The benefit would be that the folks doing the work woudl be
&gt; paying taxes, earing a legal wage, and contributing to the systems
&gt; that they require.

&gt; If you cannot understand how either scenario is preferable, then I
&gt; fele there no hope, short of surgery, to remove your rose colored
&gt; blinders.

Please note that I haven't commented on whether or not either scenaio is
prefereable.  I've restricted most of comments (not counting a few
snarks) to the operation of the law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; SO, you give citizenship status to the illegal's, and suddenly they
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't do the work either. Then who is going to pick your lettuce?

&gt; So, for the sake of lettuce, you would give up the systme of laws we
&gt; have to control illegal immigration?

You're back to the normative.  Is having illegals pick your lettuce a
&quot;bad&quot; thing?  I haven't ventured an opinion.  Right now, though, without
illegal workers, your lettuce doesn't get picked.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So the history of this country's immigration is another topic about

&gt;&gt; How's that herb garden doin'?

&gt; It is doing quite well, considering we have had a very dry year.  Had
&gt; some really nice tomatoes tonight...golden crowns.
&gt; Also had some chives form the garden for our baked potatoes..although
&gt; I have to admit the potatoes were store bought.
&gt; The potatoes were from a local farm, where there are no illegal
&gt; immigrants working.  Mostly high school kids studying agriculture.
&gt; You know, the knidn of kids that will grow up, get jobs, and
&gt; contribute to this great nation instead of sucking it dry.

You are a small, frightened person.  But I'm glad your garden is doing
well.

No they were not.  The Hawaiians were not forced off their lands.  They were
not denied their culture or their religion.  They were not forced to
live on reservations.  They were not hunted by the military.  They wre not
denied basic human rights, as were the native Americans.
The Hawaiians did not suffer because the islands were annexed.  They were
allowed to particiapte in the new economy, to buy land, to participarte in
local affairs and politics, to practice their culture and whatever religion
they chose, they were allowed to go to college, etc.  None of that was
available to the Native Americans until the 20th century.

You would have to pay more for your &quot;lettuce&quot;.  However, the cost of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to the mexican invasion is simple. Every city
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should announce there will no prosecution for crimes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against illegals. The muds will then leave on their own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overnight and it won't cost a thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now all you need to do is convince sober, intelligent people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of that. Good luck with that, champ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to illegal immigration is to not provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; illegal's anything...no schooling for their kids, no medical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; be part of theis country, and reap the rewards of being a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chose to come here illegally and by doing so accepted the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system owes under the law.  And in that context, you're the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal question
&gt;&gt;&gt; is whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.  And the
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer is yes.

&gt;&gt; Okay, then you are prepared to post a citation verifying this?
&gt;&gt; Simply tell us where in the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, it
&gt;&gt; states that we would provide free medical, educational and social
&gt;&gt; programs for all illegal immigrants in this country.

&gt; Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Nowhere have I said that
&gt; illegal immigrants must be accorded free medical care.  What I have said
&gt; is
&gt; that illegal immigrants are accorded most rights protected by the
&gt; Constitution.  Certainly this excludes those specifically reserved for
&gt; citizens, like the right to vote.

&gt; The Bill of Rights is phrased so as to restrict government (1st -
&gt; &quot;Congress
&gt; shall make no law ....&quot;).  Individuals are never identified as citizens
&gt; but
&gt; as people (4th), persons (5th)  or the accused (6th).

&gt; Also note that Plyler v Doe (1982) extends right to a public education to
&gt; children of illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They come into this country illegally, by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intent. They do not indtend to abide by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, laws and regulations that govern this country.  They do so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowingly, willfully and with intent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They certainly do.  But this action does not deprive them of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; protection of the law once they're here.

&gt;&gt; The point is that they should not.  They are not citizens. They have
&gt;&gt; no intent of becoming citizens.  They give nothing back.
&gt;&gt; If you have access to a dictionary, I encourage you to look up the
&gt;&gt; word &quot;parasite&quot;; paying particular attention to those that suck
&gt;&gt; the life out of their hosts.

&gt; None of this is germane to the topic.  Whether they should be here or not,
&gt; all people, legal or illegal, have the protection of the law, including
&gt; the
&gt; Bill of Rights.

&gt; But have you heard of IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act?  This
&gt; nifty little piece of legislation from 1986 provides penalties for
&gt; employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.  Its main effect has been to
&gt; increase the production of fake IDs, including bogus social security
&gt; numbers.  Of course, the money collected under these numbers is never paid
&gt; out.  According to the SSA, the money is worth at least $5B a year to
&gt; social security and $1.5B per year to medicare.  The chief actuary for the
&gt; SSA figures about 3/4 of the bogus numbers belong to illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ethically, you may feel you owe these people nothing.  I make no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comments on your own personal system of morals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your own system of morals is flawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've given you no indication of my ethical judgment on this issue or
&gt;&gt;&gt; any other.  I've merely commented on how the law applies.

&gt;&gt; If your morals are anything like your beliefs on &quot;how the laws apply&quot;,
&gt;&gt; then I expect them to be as equally imbalanced.

&gt; And yet I'm correct about the law.  Do you have any facts to contradict
&gt; me?
&gt; I'm not really interested in your xenophobic opinions.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you give him the same rights as you would your own family?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't seem to get your mind around the concept that he *has* the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same rights as my family

&gt;&gt; That is where you are completely wrong.  You are the one stuck in that
&gt;&gt; mode.\

&gt;&gt; because he's as human as any member of my family.

&gt;&gt; You cannot confuse ideology with reality.

&gt; Like irony much?  This is the ideology that underpins the Constitution.
&gt; Certain rights (the &quot;inalienable&quot; ones) belong to all human beings, and
&gt; the
&gt; Constitution protects those that belong to illegals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (Well, most members of my family.)  Note that those rights are civil
&gt;&gt;&gt; rights and aren't something that *I* grant.  They're not even rights
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the state grants.

&gt;&gt; Yet most of those civil rights are not applicable to non-citizens.

&gt; You have this exactly backwards.  The civil rights listed in the Bill of
&gt; Rights and due process and the equal protection of the laws apply to
&gt; everyone here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then again, being such an ignorant liberal,

&gt;&gt;&gt; You think you now my politics?  Fine.  And irrelevant.  I'm telling
&gt;&gt;&gt; you how the law works and why.

&gt;&gt; You are not ware of how the law works.

&gt; You might wish to provide evidence for that assertion.  But check the
&gt; wording of the Bill of Rights first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; it does about me.

&gt;&gt; You are the one that seems to seem nothng wrong with the situation.

&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say there's &quot;nothing wrong with
&gt; the
&gt; situation.&quot;  I've restricted my comments to the operation of the law.

&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; assume that since you are so willing to provide everything under the
&gt;&gt; sun to someone who enters your home (or your country) illegally, that
&gt;&gt; you would stop at nothing to give it to him.

&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that &quot;I'm willing to provide

&gt;&gt; being a citizen, even though they are not.

&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens &quot;should
&gt; have all the benefits of being a citize.&quot;  In fact, I've said they don't
&gt; have all the benefits, e.g., the right to vote.  I've restricted my
&gt; comments to the operation of the law for the many (note not all) rights
&gt; they do enjoy.

&gt;&gt; *YOU* are the one claiming
&gt;&gt; they should be offered the full protection of the law, even though
&gt;&gt; they are breaking those laws, willfully and with prior intent.

&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens &quot;should be
&gt; offered the full protection of the law.&quot;  I've said that they *are*
&gt; accorded the full protection of the law.

&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt; are the one who claims we should give them all the
&gt;&gt; social programs available, even though they will never be a
&gt;&gt; productive, contributing citizen.

&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that we &quot;we should give them
&gt; all the  social programs available.&quot;  I've said that they *are* accorded
&gt; *some* of these benefits, e.g., public education for their children.

&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy gining your hard
&gt;&gt; earned money to those who do not deserve it?  Do you enjoy knowing
&gt;&gt; that your childrens education is being cheapended because we have to
&gt;&gt; provide education to illegal children who do not even speak English?
&gt;&gt; Does it not bother you that part of the reason that medical insurance
&gt;&gt; is so high in this country is because we, as taxpayers and law abiding
&gt;&gt; citizens, have to pay for their medical care?

&gt; All of these are opinions unsupported by fact.  You're welcome to them,
&gt; but
&gt; none of them has the slightest relevance to the topic of what rights
&gt; illegal aliens actually enjoy in this country.  These rights are numerous,
&gt; although citizens enjoy more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But we're not talking about a nonexistent right to trespass on
&gt;&gt;&gt; private property.  We're talking about civil

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no need to show compassion to people who come here

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WWJD?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Prosecute the companies and people giving them jobs, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; make the punishment for hiring illegal's very severe.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Fingerprint and photograph every illegal in the country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyone caught sneaking in to this country is immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; deported.  Any money found on any illegal in this country
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; would be confiscated before sending them back across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; border.  Make it so that it is not attractive for them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; come here. It is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; dark cloud of liberalism that allows this country to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; conditions here so favorable and attractive for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the native Hawaiians should do the same to you racist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repugnant haole cunts who invaded and destroyed their lands.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Hawaiian Islands were allowed to be ceded to the United
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; States by Queen Lilioukalani.  There was no miltiary takeover.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was no use of force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bwahahahahaha!  It was a coup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Another primitive backwards stoneage people who have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ultimately benefitted from white Anglo Saxon colonization.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That right gripes your ass, doesn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;benefitted&quot; means &quot;almost wiped out by disease and having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one's country forcibly annexed&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiians ruled their own country until 1898.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it was *their* *own* *country* until we annexed it.  By
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No force was used.  You need a new source of information.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please enlighten me.  Also, do you have any sources on how the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grateful Indians gave their lands away?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were forced to give up their land.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They were moved by gunpoint.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many tribes were hunted by the military.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The whites used biological warfare on them by giving them blankets
&gt;&gt;&gt; contaminated with smallpox and yellow fever.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You hold that as a standard to be admired?  You advocate that?

&gt;&gt; Good heavens!  Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Where do

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you see the world through rose colored, albeit myopic,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm the one worrying about the next pandemic.  You're the one who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks that closing emergency rooms to illegal immigrants will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affect their numbers.  And *I'm* the one with the rose-colored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You would give up our current problems for a set of different, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much more difficult problems.\
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That a non sequitur, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not at all....although in your state of mind you will probably see
&gt;&gt;&gt; it that way...

&gt;&gt; Please explain how I would give up our current problems for more
&gt;&gt; difficult ones.

&gt; You would have to pay more for your &quot;lettuce&quot;.  However, the cost of
&gt; education and medical care would drop, because honest folks would not
&gt; have to pay for the millions of illegals using those systems.  Also,
&gt; those that chose to come to this counntry to work would be paying
&gt; taxes, instead of sending the money out of the country.

&gt;  Show your work, preferably with quotations from my posts.

&gt; My &quot;work&quot;?  Please clarify....
">

Well, I was hoping for more than bald statements of opinion.  If illegals
were excluded from California agriculture, would the price of lettuce
actually go up?  Or would the disappearance of a cheap pool of lettuce
pickers lead to importation of cheap lettuce?  Why would the cost of
education drop?  True, there would be fewer children of illegals to
teach, but there would be fewer illegals paying real estate taxes (either
directly or through rent). By how much would the cost of medical care
drop?  Do you have any evidence that the cost of caring for illegals
drives health-care inflation?  Please include the $1.5B per year that
medicare now receives as a result of unclaimed payroll taxes.

I don't know the answers to these questions.  That's why I'm asking.
You, on the other hand, seem to know.  That's why I'm asking you.

Oh, by the way.  About that education.  Are you willing to admit that
public education for their children is a right that illegal immigrants
enjoy?  Note I'm not saying whether they should or should not have this
right.  But that they do.  Have you understood this yet?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Note how  difficult this will be.

&gt; It will be difficult because your question makes no sense.
&gt;  Hint:  I haven't set out any plans or programs.
&gt;&gt; I've just commented on how the law works.

&gt; You have commented on how you &quot;think&quot; the law works.  You have been
&gt; proven wrong.
">

Your claim that I'm wrong isn't proof.  I've quoted you a Supreme Court
ruling granting the children of illegals the right to a public education.
Do you dispute this?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Constituution and the Bill of Rights do not apply
&gt; to anyoen but citizens of the United States, yet you continue to claim
&gt; that they apply to everyone in the world.
">

Please get my claim right.  Certain parts of the Constitution (including
the Bill of Rights, due process and equal treatment under the law) apply
to anyone within the jurisdiction of the law.  This includes everyone
physically present on US territory except for some narrowly-defined
classes of people like foreign diplomats.  Note that this excludes most
people in the world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Because of that , you are incapable of valid discourse.
">

And yet, I'm correct.  Go figure.  Might I have a cite -- perhaps to some
wording in the Constitution or to some Supreme Court case -- that backs
up your claim?  This won't be easy to do.

A brief googling turns up the case USA v Oscar Antonio Lara-Garcia, an
appeals case from the 10th Circuit (3/07).  Mr. L-G admitted to being an
illegal while he was in custody for a traffic violation.  He asked that
his admission be suppressed because he wasn't given the Miranda warning.
The court ruled that the information was indeed suppressible.  That is,
the fact Mr. L-G was entitled to that right and didn't receive it put the
government's ability to use his admission in jeopardy. (Unfortunately for
Mr. L-G, the appeals court ruled that under the &quot;inevitable discovery&quot;
exception the lack of a warning wasn't enough to suppress his admission.
After all, they had his fingerprints, which were on file.)

Can you find any cites to a case where a court ruled that the Miranda
warning doesn't apply to immigrants?  That's the kind of thing you need
to make your case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; medical treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to be part of theis country, and reap the rewards of being a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their rights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they have as a result of their common humanity with us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They chose to come here illegally and by doing so accepted the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system owes under the law.  And in that context, you're the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the answer is yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, then you are prepared to post a citation verifying this?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply tell us where in the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; states that we would provide free medical, educational and social
&gt;&gt;&gt; programs for all illegal immigrants in this country.

&gt;&gt; Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Nowhere have I said
&gt;&gt; that illegal immigrants must be accorded free medical care.  What I
&gt;&gt; have said is
&gt;&gt; that illegal immigrants are accorded most rights protected by the
&gt;&gt; Constitution.  Certainly this excludes those specifically reserved
&gt;&gt; for citizens, like the right to vote.

&gt;&gt; The Bill of Rights is phrased so as to restrict government (1st -
&gt;&gt; &quot;Congress
&gt;&gt; shall make no law ....&quot;).  Individuals are never identified as
&gt;&gt; citizens but
&gt;&gt; as people (4th), persons (5th)  or the accused (6th).

&gt;&gt; Also note that Plyler v Doe (1982) extends right to a public
&gt;&gt; education to children of illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They come into this country illegally, by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intent. They do not indtend to abide by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, laws and regulations that govern this country.  They do so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowingly, willfully and with intent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They certainly do.  But this action does not deprive them of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protection of the law once they're here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is that they should not.  They are not citizens. They have
&gt;&gt;&gt; no intent of becoming citizens.  They give nothing back.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have access to a dictionary, I encourage you to look up the
&gt;&gt;&gt; word &quot;parasite&quot;; paying particular attention to those that suck
&gt;&gt;&gt; the life out of their hosts.

&gt;&gt; None of this is germane to the topic.  Whether they should be here or
&gt;&gt; not, all people, legal or illegal, have the protection of the law,
&gt;&gt; including the
&gt;&gt; Bill of Rights.

&gt;&gt; But have you heard of IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act?
&gt;&gt; This nifty little piece of legislation from 1986 provides penalties
&gt;&gt; for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.  Its main effect has
&gt;&gt; been to increase the production of fake IDs, including bogus social
&gt;&gt; security numbers.  Of course, the money collected under these numbers
&gt;&gt; is never paid out.  According to the SSA, the money is worth at least
&gt;&gt; $5B a year to social security and $1.5B per year to medicare.  The
&gt;&gt; chief actuary for the SSA figures about 3/4 of the bogus numbers
&gt;&gt; belong to illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ethically, you may feel you owe these people nothing.  I make no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comments on your own personal system of morals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your own system of morals is flawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've given you no indication of my ethical judgment on this issue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or any other.  I've merely commented on how the law applies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your morals are anything like your beliefs on &quot;how the laws
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply&quot;, then I expect them to be as equally imbalanced.

&gt;&gt; And yet I'm correct about the law.  Do you have any facts to
&gt;&gt; contradict me?
&gt;&gt; I'm not really interested in your xenophobic opinions.

&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you give him the same rights as you would your own family?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't seem to get your mind around the concept that he *has*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same rights as my family

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is where you are completely wrong.  You are the one stuck in
&gt;&gt;&gt; that mode.\

&gt;&gt;&gt; because he's as human as any member of my family.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot confuse ideology with reality.

&gt;&gt; Like irony much?  This is the ideology that underpins the
&gt;&gt; Constitution. Certain rights (the &quot;inalienable&quot; ones) belong to all
&gt;&gt; human beings, and the
&gt;&gt; Constitution protects those that belong to illegals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Well, most members of my family.)  Note that those rights are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civil rights and aren't something that *I* grant.  They're not even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rights that the state grants.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet most of those civil rights are not applicable to non-citizens.

&gt;&gt; You have this exactly backwards.  The civil rights listed in the Bill
&gt;&gt; of Rights and due process and the equal protection of the laws apply
&gt;&gt; to everyone here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then again, being such an ignorant liberal,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You think you now my politics?  Fine.  And irrelevant.  I'm telling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you how the law works and why.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not ware of how the law works.

&gt;&gt; You might wish to provide evidence for that assertion.  But check the
&gt;&gt; wording of the Bill of Rights first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you probably would  You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would probably kill one of you own children so that you could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offer him a bed to sleep in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice.  I think this little comment tell us much more about you than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it does about me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are the one that seems to seem nothng wrong with the situation.

&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say there's &quot;nothing wrong
&gt;&gt; with the
&gt;&gt; situation.&quot;  I've restricted my comments to the operation of the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that since you are so willing to provide everything under the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sun to someone who enters your home (or your country) illegally,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you would stop at nothing to give it to him.

&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that &quot;I'm willing to
&gt;&gt; provide everything under the sun&quot; to illegal aliens.  I've restricted
&gt;&gt; my comments to the operation of the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the picture
&gt;&gt;&gt; *YOU* painted. *YOU* claim that they should have all the benfits of
&gt;&gt;&gt; being a citizen, even though they are not.

&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens
&gt;&gt; &quot;should have all the benefits of being a citize.&quot;  In fact, I've said
&gt;&gt; they don't have all the benefits, e.g., the right to vote.  I've
&gt;&gt; restricted my comments to the operation of the law for the many (note
&gt;&gt; not all) rights they do enjoy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *YOU* are the one claiming
&gt;&gt;&gt; they should be offered the full protection of the law, even though
&gt;&gt;&gt; they are breaking those laws, willfully and with prior intent.

&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens
&gt;&gt; &quot;should be offered the full protection of the law.&quot;  I've said that
&gt;&gt; they *are* accorded the full protection of the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt; are the one who claims we should give them all the
&gt;&gt;&gt; social programs available, even though they will never be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; productive, contributing citizen.

&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that we &quot;we should give
&gt;&gt; them all the  social programs available.&quot;  I've said that they *are*
&gt;&gt; accorded *some* of these benefits, e.g., public education for their
&gt;&gt; children.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy gining your hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; earned money to those who do not deserve it?  Do you enjoy knowing
&gt;&gt;&gt; that your childrens education is being cheapended because we have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide education to illegal children who do not even speak English?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it not bother you that part of the reason that medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance is so high in this country is because we, as taxpayers and
&gt;&gt;&gt; law abiding citizens, have to pay for their medical care?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you see the world through rose colored, albeit myopic,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm the one worrying about the next pandemic.  You're the one who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks that closing emergency rooms to illegal immigrants will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affect their numbers.  And *I'm* the one with the rose-colored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You would give up our current problems for a set of different,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and much more difficult problems.\
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That a non sequitur, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not at all....although in your state of mind you will probably see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it that way...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please explain how I would give up our current problems for more
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult ones.

&gt;&gt; You would have to pay more for your &quot;lettuce&quot;.  However, the cost of
&gt;&gt; education and medical care would drop, because honest folks would not
&gt;&gt; have to pay for the millions of illegals using those systems.  Also,
&gt;&gt; those that chose to come to this counntry to work would be paying
&gt;&gt; taxes, instead of sending the money out of the country.

&gt;&gt;  Show your work, preferably with quotations from my posts.

&gt;&gt; My &quot;work&quot;?  Please clarify....

&gt; Well, I was hoping for more than bald statements of opinion.  If
&gt; illegals were excluded from California agriculture, would the price
&gt; of lettuce actually go up?
">

If continued to be produced in the U$ at the now higher costs,
most certainly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or would the disappearance of a cheap
&gt; pool of lettuce pickers lead to importation of cheap lettuce?
">

Depends on a few factors such as whether the market would
willingly pay the new higher prices without resistance, and whether
the new higher prices caused enough advantage for someone to
bring in cheaper imported lettuce.

Something the pig-ignorant racists and bigots who have jumped
onto the anti-immigration wagon overlook is that their precious
&quot;free-market capitalism&quot; -- which they have exactly ZERO comprehension
of -- mandates that businesses find and exploit the cheapest methods
of production, whether that means importing the cheap labor to the
U$ factories/farms, or moving the U$ factories/farms to the cheap labor.

The difference being that when the cheap labor is imported an infinitely
larger portion of the $$ paid to that labor, whether it be legal or
illegal in immigration status, stays in and benefits the U$ economy.
Wages paid overseas in foreign factories have ZERO direct benefit
to the U$ economy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Why would the cost of education drop?
">

There is a fixed cost of providing education infrastructure
that prevents costs from dropping on a purely per-capita basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  True, there would be fewer children of illegals to teach,
">

Children born in the USA are legal citizens of the U$A,
whether their parent(s) were in the U$A illegally working,
or visiting on vacation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but there would be fewer illegals
&gt; paying real estate taxes (either directly or through rent).
">

Yep. Which would contribute to the record-setting economic
disaster that is the U$ housing/mortgage market. In fact some
might say that the myopic &quot;crack-down&quot; on immigration that
began a year or so ago actually precipitated the current crisis.
And it is going to get a lot worse before it even begins to bottom
out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By how much would the cost of medical care drop?
&gt; Do you have any evidence that the cost of caring for
&gt; illegals drives health-care inflation?
">

Only if you believe that the immigrants are sicker more
often than the racist white-trash obese bigots and don't pay
for any of their health care. That fact that some of the immigrants
receive health insurance benefits from their employer not only
mitigates the assertion, it also LOWERS the cost of health insurance
benefits to the employer/employees by increasing the paying members
of the pool.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Please include the $1.5B per year that medicare now receives as a
&gt; result of unclaimed payroll taxes.

The white-trash racists and bigots will claim that the elderly
illegal immigrants are somehow siphoning off Medicare and
Social Security.

&gt; that his admission be suppressed because he wasn't given the Miranda

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to illegal immigration is to not provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal's anything...no schooling for their kids, no medical

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It isn't supposed to be compassionate you pig ignorant moron.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no need to show compassion to people who come here

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WWJD?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prosecute the companies and people giving them jobs, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make the punishment for hiring illegal's very severe.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprint and photograph every illegal in the country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone caught sneaking in to this country is immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deported.  Any money found on any illegal in this country
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be confiscated before sending them back across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; border.  Make it so that it is not attractive for them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come here. It is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dark cloud of liberalism that allows this country to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions here so favorable and attractive for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the native Hawaiians should do the same to you racist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repugnant haole cunts who invaded and destroyed their lands.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Hawaiian Islands were allowed to be ceded to the United
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; States by Queen Lilioukalani.  There was no miltiary takeover. There was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no use of force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bwahahahahaha!  It was a coup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Another primitive backwards stoneage people who have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ultimately benefitted from white Anglo Saxon colonization.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one's country forcibly annexed&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiians ruled their own country until 1898.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it was *their* *own* *country* until we annexed it.  By
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No force was used.  You need a new source of information.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please enlighten me.  Also, do you have any sources on how the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grateful Indians gave their lands away?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were forced to give up their land.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They were moved by gunpoint.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many tribes were hunted by the military.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The whites used biological warfare on them by giving them blankets
&gt;&gt;&gt; contaminated with smallpox and yellow fever.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You hold that as a standard to be admired?  You advocate that?

&gt;&gt; Good heavens!  Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Where do

&gt; You typed it and posted it above.

&gt; The takeover of Indian territories is a
&gt;&gt; shameful part of of our history, and my point is that some of the

&gt; No they were not.  The Hawaiians were not forced off their lands. They were
&gt; not denied their culture or their religion.  They were not
&gt; forced to live on reservations.  They were not hunted by the military.  They

'Conquest of Hawaii' a painfully true account of island history
VIEWPOINT
The Maui News
Tuesday, October 21, 2003
(Read the original unedited version)

By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

The History Channel presentation &quot;Conquest of Hawaii&quot; on Oct. 12 was very
accurate and painfully true as to the history of Hawaii and the facts of the
past. It was very surprising that The Maui News editorial (Oct. 14) did not
think so.

The editorial writer must have looked at the show with a jaundiced eye. The
narrator, John Osorio, is a

professor of Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawaii, Kelly Hu is a
Native Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha Schools. Rocky Jensen is a
sculptor and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture. They are truly kamaaina
(children of the land).

Almost every question raised about the presentation was based on books that
were written about history. Research was done with the Hawaiian method of
passing oral history from one generation to the other in the form of oli or
chants. It is our unique method of documentation.

We have chants that predicted the coming of the Western man 200 to 300 years
before they arrived in 1778. The facts of this exist in footprints that were
carved in sandstone by a kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man
would come here someday and obliterate the kanaka maoli. These sandstone
plaques, called Kalaina Waewae, can be found at Moomomi Beach on Molokai.

&quot;Conquest of Hawaii&quot; brought tears to my kanaka maole eyes to see again the
numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a historian, lecturer and cultural
specialist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the presentation and the
accuracy of the events in our past history. Overall it was well put together.

Capt. James Cook brought diseases that decimated our people by the hundreds of
thousands. The missionaries arrived in 1820, to do exactly what the host, Hu,
said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they did well.&quot;

Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In the
name of Christianity, they became advisers to the kings and queens of Hawaii and
changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land. Not being satisfied with
controlling the land, with the help of U.S. troops they took over the Hawaiian
Islands in 1893 in what is known as the &quot;overthrow.&quot; It should have been known
as a terrorist attack on a friendly nation.

The anti-annexation petition did contain 98 percent of all the Hawaiians
living in Hawaii. As for the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with tainted
title. Missionary descendants, American businessmen and others gave Hawaii to
America. They were not the true owners of the land. Everyone - not just the
kanaka maoli - who lived in Hawaii was allowed to vote for statehood. The
question is are the kanaka maoli better off today because of the Statehood Act?

All the trouble Hawaiians face today is a direct result of being colonized.

Our people can not find affordable homes and they have to leave Hawaii because
not even three jobs are enough to support their families. The Office of Hawaiian
Affairs, the Hawaiian Home Lands Act, the Hawaiian people, their entitlements
and the alii trusts are being attacked with the laws of this great nation.

The editorial says that the movie avoided &quot;questions facing Hawaiians today.&quot;
If you looked carefully, the answers to why this is happening today are directly
related to events that happened in the past.

These islands always belonged to us. This is our ancestral home. It is time
that we stand up and fight for it. Ku ika pono, justice for Hawaiians. Please
see my Web site www.moolelo.com .

Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell is a cultural adviser on Hawaiian affairs and an
early activist for Hawaiian rights. He lives in Pukalani.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you see the world through rose colored, albeit myopic,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm the one worrying about the next pandemic.  You're the one who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks that closing emergency rooms to illegal immigrants will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affect their numbers.  And *I'm* the one with the rose-colored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glasses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You would give up our current problems for a set of different,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and much more difficult problems.\
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That a non sequitur, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not at all....although in your state of mind you will probably see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it that way...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please explain how I would give up our current problems for more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You would have to pay more for your &quot;lettuce&quot;.  However, the cost of
&gt;&gt;&gt; education and medical care would drop, because honest folks would
&gt;&gt;&gt; not have to pay for the millions of illegals using those systems.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, those that chose to come to this counntry to work would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; paying taxes, instead of sending the money out of the country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Show your work, preferably with quotations from my posts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My &quot;work&quot;?  Please clarify....

&gt;&gt; Well, I was hoping for more than bald statements of opinion.  If
&gt;&gt; illegals were excluded from California agriculture, would the price
&gt;&gt; of lettuce actually go up?

&gt; If continued to be produced in the U$ at the now higher costs,
&gt; most certainly.

&gt;&gt; Or would the disappearance of a cheap
&gt;&gt; pool of lettuce pickers lead to importation of cheap lettuce?

&gt; Depends on a few factors such as whether the market would
&gt; willingly pay the new higher prices without resistance, and whether
&gt; the new higher prices caused enough advantage for someone to
&gt; bring in cheaper imported lettuce.

&gt; Something the pig-ignorant racists and bigots who have jumped
&gt; onto the anti-immigration wagon overlook is that their precious
&gt; &quot;free-market capitalism&quot; -- which they have exactly ZERO comprehension
&gt; of -- mandates that businesses find and exploit the cheapest methods
&gt; of production, whether that means importing the cheap labor to the
&gt; U$ factories/farms, or moving the U$ factories/farms to the cheap
&gt; labor.

&gt; The difference being that when the cheap labor is imported an
&gt; infinitely larger portion of the $$ paid to that labor, whether it be
&gt; legal or illegal in immigration status, stays in and benefits the U$
&gt; economy. Wages paid overseas in foreign factories have ZERO direct
&gt; benefit to the U$ economy.

&gt;&gt;  Why would the cost of education drop?

&gt; There is a fixed cost of providing education infrastructure
&gt; that prevents costs from dropping on a purely per-capita basis.

&gt;&gt;  True, there would be fewer children of illegals to teach,

&gt; Children born in the USA are legal citizens of the U$A,
&gt; whether their parent(s) were in the U$A illegally working,
&gt; or visiting on vacation.
">

Absolutely.  And I don't believe that even the state of Texas disputed
that child citizens of illegals had the right to a public education.  The
case Texas lost set the precedent that *all* children here have that
right.

&gt;&gt; but there would be fewer illegals
&gt;&gt; paying real estate taxes (either directly or through rent).

&gt; Yep. Which would contribute to the record-setting economic
&gt; disaster that is the U$ housing/mortgage market. In fact some
&gt; might say that the myopic &quot;crack-down&quot; on immigration that
&gt; began a year or so ago actually precipitated the current crisis.
&gt; And it is going to get a lot worse before it even begins to bottom
&gt; out.

&gt;&gt; By how much would the cost of medical care drop?
&gt;&gt; Do you have any evidence that the cost of caring for
&gt;&gt; illegals drives health-care inflation?

&gt; Only if you believe that the immigrants are sicker more
&gt; often than the racist white-trash obese bigots and don't pay
&gt; for any of their health care. That fact that some of the immigrants
&gt; receive health insurance benefits from their employer not only
&gt; mitigates the assertion, it also LOWERS the cost of health insurance
&gt; benefits to the employer/employees by increasing the paying members
&gt; of the pool.

&gt;&gt; Please include the $1.5B per year that medicare now receives as a
&gt;&gt; result of unclaimed payroll taxes.

&gt; The white-trash racists and bigots will claim that the elderly
&gt; illegal immigrants are somehow siphoning off Medicare and
&gt; Social Security.

&gt;&gt; I don't know the answers to these questions.  That's why I'm asking.
&gt;&gt; You, on the other hand, seem to know.  That's why I'm asking you.

ATTENTION HONU:  Ignore the preceding two lines and the rest of the
insults in the preceding.  All of the considerations mentioned need to go
into a rational judgment about the economic effects of illegal
immigration.  I make no claims to know the answers, but at least I know
that the questions are complex.  Remember:  fear comes from ignorance,
and ignorance is curable.

&gt;&gt; Oh, by the way.  About that education.  Are you willing to admit that
&gt;&gt; public education for their children is a right that illegal
&gt;&gt; immigrants enjoy?  Note I'm not saying whether they should or should
&gt;&gt; not have this right.  But that they do.  Have you understood this
&gt;&gt; yet?

&gt; Lying racists and bigots like honu hurt donut don't comprehend
&gt; anything beyond their own pig-ignorant delusions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note how  difficult this will be.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It will be difficult because your question makes no sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Hint:  I haven't set out any plans or programs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've just commented on how the law works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have commented on how you &quot;think&quot; the law works.  You have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; proven wrong.

&gt;&gt; Your claim that I'm wrong isn't proof.  I've quoted you a Supreme
&gt;&gt; Court ruling granting the children of illegals the right to a public
&gt;&gt; education. Do you dispute this?

&gt; Honu's a lowlife lying repugnikan piece of shit, of course he'll deny
&gt; that reality if it furthers his contemptible racism and bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Constituution and the Bill of Rights do not apply
&gt;&gt;&gt; to anyoen but citizens of the United States, yet you continue to
&gt;&gt;&gt; claim that they apply to everyone in the world.

&gt;&gt; Please get my claim right.  Certain parts of the Constitution
&gt;&gt; (including the Bill of Rights, due process and equal treatment under
&gt;&gt; the law) apply to anyone within the jurisdiction of the law.  This
&gt;&gt; includes everyone physically present on US territory except for some
&gt;&gt; narrowly-defined classes of people like foreign diplomats.  Note that
&gt;&gt; this excludes most people in the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of that , you are incapable of valid discourse.

&gt;&gt; And yet, I'm correct.  Go figure.  Might I have a cite -- perhaps to
&gt;&gt; some wording in the Constitution or to some Supreme Court case --
&gt;&gt; that backs up your claim?  This won't be easy to do.

&gt; Honu's a lying shitbag, all he's ever been, all he'll ever be.

&gt;&gt; A brief googling turns up the case USA v Oscar Antonio Lara-Garcia,
&gt;&gt; an appeals case from the 10th Circuit (3/07).  Mr. L-G admitted to
&gt;&gt; being an illegal while he was in custody for a traffic violation.  He
&gt;&gt; asked that his admission be suppressed because he wasn't given the
&gt;&gt; Miranda warning. The court ruled that the information was indeed
&gt;&gt; suppressible.  That is, the fact Mr. L-G was entitled to that right
&gt;&gt; and didn't receive it put the government's ability to use his
&gt;&gt; admission in jeopardy. (Unfortunately for Mr. L-G, the appeals court
&gt;&gt; ruled that under the &quot;inevitable discovery&quot; exception the lack of a
&gt;&gt; warning wasn't enough to suppress his admission. After all, they had
&gt;&gt; his fingerprints, which were on file.)

&gt;&gt; Can you find any cites to a case where a court ruled that the Miranda
&gt;&gt; warning doesn't apply to immigrants?  That's the kind of thing you
&gt;&gt; need to make your case.

&gt; Well, the criminal Bu$h mob could attempt to decree the undocumented
&gt; immigrants as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;, then under the immoral, unethical
&gt; and repugnant Bu$h doctrine, deny them ALL rights, not just U$
&gt; constitutional rights, but worldwide recognized basic human rights.

&gt; Scumbags like honu hurt donut would no doubt support such an
&gt; obscenity.
">

Maybe it's those rose-colored lenses that Honu accuses me of wearing, but
I prefer to think that people like Honu aren't scumbags but just so
frightened of the unknown that they jump to a reflexive and unreflective
xenophobia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are here illegally.  We owe them nothing.  If they wish
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be part of theis country, and reap the rewards of being a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizen, let them do it *legally*.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is incorrect.  We owe them the protection of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rights, which they have as a result of their common humanity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with us. This is the basis for our system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. We owe them nothing. They aren't entitled to anything.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They chose to come here illegally and by doing so accepted the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences that should come with that i.e. deportation etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm posting from misc.legal.  When I say owe, I mean what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system owes under the law.  And in that context, you're the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We &quot;owe&quot; them nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again.  If it makes you feel better to say we &quot;owe&quot; them nothing,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then fine.  Let's call that an ethical question.  The legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is whether the protections of the law extend to illegals.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the answer is yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, then you are prepared to post a citation verifying this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply tell us where in the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; states that we would provide free medical, educational and social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programs for all illegal immigrants in this country.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Nowhere have I said
&gt;&gt;&gt; that illegal immigrants must be accorded free medical care.  What I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have said is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that illegal immigrants are accorded most rights protected by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution.  Certainly this excludes those specifically reserved
&gt;&gt;&gt; for citizens, like the right to vote.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Bill of Rights is phrased so as to restrict government (1st -
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Congress
&gt;&gt;&gt; shall make no law ....&quot;).  Individuals are never identified as
&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens but
&gt;&gt;&gt; as people (4th), persons (5th)  or the accused (6th).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also note that Plyler v Doe (1982) extends right to a public
&gt;&gt;&gt; education to children of illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They come into this country illegally, by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intent. They do not indtend to abide by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, laws and regulations that govern this country.  They do so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowingly, willfully and with intent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They certainly do.  But this action does not deprive them of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protection of the law once they're here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is that they should not.  They are not citizens. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have no intent of becoming citizens.  They give nothing back.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have access to a dictionary, I encourage you to look up the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word &quot;parasite&quot;; paying particular attention to those that suck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the life out of their hosts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; None of this is germane to the topic.  Whether they should be here
&gt;&gt;&gt; or not, all people, legal or illegal, have the protection of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; law, including the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill of Rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But have you heard of IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act?
&gt;&gt;&gt; This nifty little piece of legislation from 1986 provides penalties
&gt;&gt;&gt; for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.  Its main effect
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been to increase the production of fake IDs, including bogus
&gt;&gt;&gt; social security numbers.  Of course, the money collected under
&gt;&gt;&gt; these numbers is never paid out.  According to the SSA, the money
&gt;&gt;&gt; is worth at least $5B a year to social security and $1.5B per year
&gt;&gt;&gt; to medicare.  The chief actuary for the SSA figures about 3/4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the bogus numbers belong to illegal immigrants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ethically, you may feel you owe these people nothing.  I make no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comments on your own personal system of morals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your own system of morals is flawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've given you no indication of my ethical judgment on this issue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or any other.  I've merely commented on how the law applies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If your morals are anything like your beliefs on &quot;how the laws
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apply&quot;, then I expect them to be as equally imbalanced.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet I'm correct about the law.  Do you have any facts to
&gt;&gt;&gt; contradict me?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not really interested in your xenophobic opinions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you give him the same rights as you would your own family?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't seem to get your mind around the concept that he *has*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same rights as my family

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is where you are completely wrong.  You are the one stuck in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that mode.\

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because he's as human as any member of my family.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot confuse ideology with reality.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like irony much?  This is the ideology that underpins the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution. Certain rights (the &quot;inalienable&quot; ones) belong to all
&gt;&gt;&gt; human beings, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Constitution protects those that belong to illegals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Well, most members of my family.)  Note that those rights are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civil rights and aren't something that *I* grant.  They're not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even rights that the state grants.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet most of those civil rights are not applicable to non-citizens.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have this exactly backwards.  The civil rights listed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill of Rights and due process and the equal protection of the laws
&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to everyone here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then again, being such an ignorant liberal,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You think you now my politics?  Fine.  And irrelevant.  I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; telling you how the law works and why.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not ware of how the law works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You might wish to provide evidence for that assertion.  But check
&gt;&gt;&gt; the wording of the Bill of Rights first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you probably would  You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would probably kill one of you own children so that you could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offer him a bed to sleep in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice.  I think this little comment tell us much more about you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than it does about me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are the one that seems to seem nothng wrong with the situation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say there's &quot;nothing wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; situation.&quot;  I've restricted my comments to the operation of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that since you are so willing to provide everything under
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the sun to someone who enters your home (or your country)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegally, that you would stop at nothing to give it to him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that &quot;I'm willing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide everything under the sun&quot; to illegal aliens.  I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; restricted my comments to the operation of the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the picture
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *YOU* painted. *YOU* claim that they should have all the benfits of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being a citizen, even though they are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;should have all the benefits of being a citize.&quot;  In fact, I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; said they don't have all the benefits, e.g., the right to vote.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've restricted my comments to the operation of the law for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; many (note not all) rights they do enjoy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *YOU* are the one claiming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they should be offered the full protection of the law, even though
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are breaking those laws, willfully and with prior intent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that illegal aliens
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;should be offered the full protection of the law.&quot;  I've said that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they *are* accorded the full protection of the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are the one who claims we should give them all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; social programs available, even though they will never be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; productive, contributing citizen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please quote one of my posts in which I say that we &quot;we should give
&gt;&gt;&gt; them all the  social programs available.&quot;  I've said that they *are*
&gt;&gt;&gt; accorded *some* of these benefits, e.g., public education for their
&gt;&gt;&gt; children.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy gining your hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earned money to those who do not deserve it?  Do you enjoy knowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that your childrens education is being cheapended because we have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to provide education to illegal children who do not even speak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English? Does it not bother
