&quot;Tom Paine's 4th of July Advice for Congress&quot;

:: Our ragtag army beat the best military force in the world. In
today's world, our men would've been called 'terrorists', 'insurgents'
- and I'm sure they would be alleged to 'hide among the civilian
population'.  But when freedom is your cause - particularly freedom
from a hostile foreign military presence on your soil - it can be a
very powerful force to be reckoned with. So the British discovered
some 200 years back. Happy Fourth, Limeys! Oh I'm a Yankee Doodle
Dandy, Yankee Doodle do or die.. ::

&quot;'Israel ruining economy in Gaza Strip'&quot;

Israel has erased from its computers the customs code used to
identify goods entering Gaza and issued orders not to release them
until further notice. This policy has cost Palestinian importers $1.5
million in the first two weeks of the closure, including fines paid
for the use of rented containers, breach of contracts and damage to
goods stored in warehouses for extended periods of time, the
organization said.

the West Bank political capital of Ramallah.

:: Withholding the tax customs (and thus the salaries of ordinary
people) as a means of collective punishment because of who they voted

&quot;A time for joy and reflection by Khalid Mish'al&quot;

The Palestinian people have been struggling for their freedom for
almost a century. In our own land we have been denied basic human
rights by an occupier that has enjoyed, under various spurious guises,
international support. As Alan Johnston returns home, we hope that the
British, and people the world over, reflect on the fact that more than
12,000 Palestinians are languishing in Israeli jails, unjustly denied
their freedom.

&quot;Investigate army shooting of Palestinian demonstrators&quot;

and Lebanese civilians that left two Palestinians dead and at least 28

&quot;Rescue role welcomed but isolation set to remain&quot;

Another positive sign is that Hamas has been drafting former members
of Fatah who used to man Gaza's border crossings into Israel. Policing
the streets and rescuing hostages is one thing: meeting the daily
needs of 1.4 million impoverished people, including the desperate need
to be able to work in Israel, quite another. It cannot do that unless
it mends fences with Fatah.

According to DefenseNews.com, the &quot;See-Shoot&quot; system developed by
Israel's Rafael defense contractor will use a series of sensors,
aircraft and remote controlled weapons along the border. The
technology could prove to be fairly contentious, as there have been a
number of incidents along the border in which innocent children have
been killed by Israeli soldiers.

&quot;Blue Streak: Message Sent by Bush's Commutation of Libby's Prison
Sentence&quot;

In Cleveland, the widely respected leader of the Muslim mosque,
active for years in interfaith cooperation, was convicted of a single
count of making a false statement on his immigration papers, sentenced
to prison and then deported. The Appeals Court affirmed, in United
States v. Damrah, and last time I checked, the cleric who had rabbis
testifying in his defense was being held in a Palestinian prison. The
same tactic is being used against other Muslims across the country who
have never provided aid to terrorists, never supported terrorist
organizations and have even less reason than Mr. Libby, a lawyer with
the best counsel money can buy, to know that the way to avoid
prosecution is by simply not answering a question.

:: Hard to believe that this appears on Fox. ::
