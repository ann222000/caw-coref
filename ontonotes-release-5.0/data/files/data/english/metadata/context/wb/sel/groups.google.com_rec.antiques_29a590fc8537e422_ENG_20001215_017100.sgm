I know, I know - I'm perpetuating spam.....but
sometimes, they're just so damned funny!

&quot;GOVERNING LAW
Your purchase of the item(s) through our website shall
be deemed to be a contract made under Singapore
governed by the laws of the Republic of Singapore.
You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
courts and to abide by all applicable local, state, national
and international laws and regulations.&quot;

In other words: if you renege on your purchase,
you're going to get CANED!

BTW, they are advertising &quot;19th centuary&quot; items - and
they'll engrave them for you.
