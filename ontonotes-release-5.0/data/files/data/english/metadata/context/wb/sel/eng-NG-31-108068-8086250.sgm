Well, In United Kingdom they are.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray#Legality

I came across this because of looking up an ingredient in a pepper spray
device offered by Midway and was astounded by the variation in the
control and legality of pepper spray for defensive use against humans.

In Israel and many states, anyone over 18 can carry pepper spray. It
goes downhill from there. Guess what the legality of pepper spray in
Washington DC is?

Amazing...

On the other hand, if you go to an outdoors supplier and buy and carry Bear
Spray, would it still be considered illegal anti-human peppper spray.  Since
the primary ingredients are similar or even identical, would the label give
you any kind of legal defense if you are arrested?  Interesting angle.  Any
real lawyers out there that address this?

You might have a difficult time convincing a jury that you were
intending to defend yourself against a bear attack, and only happened to
wind up dousing some poor mugger.

It probably depends on how you are using it. Spraying wasps and cleaning
ovens is no big deal; giving some poor defenseless tweaker who is an
underprivileged victim of society a faceful might get some prosecutors
interested in altering your future.

IANAL, and yeah, that might be a bit of a stretch but it's unlikely
anyone would carry the bear spray size anyways.  That's the same size
that the RCMP is often seen hosing down protesters with.  It's roughly
the size and shape of a small kitchen fire extinguisher, so it's not
exactly compact.  A camper might have no trouble lugging it around in
their pack, but not only is it a bit conspicuous, it'd just be a royal
pain in the butt to carry around.

The size that people in the USA often carry around for self defense
seems to be a small canister with a key chain or holster.  It's roughly
the size of a AA maglight, perhaps smaller.  That size is often marketed
as &quot;dog repellent.&quot;   You might not see too many bears on city streets,
but there are lots of dogs, and not all owners are big on controlling
their pets.  Having dog repellent in a holster or key chain due to a
fear of dog attack is considerably more plausible.  It's also seems far
more convenient than the huge bear spray size.

Interesting. I never considered wasp spray as a substitute from pepper
spray.

I have two cans of wasp spray from different manufacturers. On the
label of Spectricide Wasp &amp; Hornet Killer, it states: &quot;It is a
violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent
with its labeling.&quot; One the label of Victor Poison Free Wasp &amp; Hornet
Killer, it states: &quot;It is a violation of State law to use this product
in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.&quot; The Victor product is
made in PA. The labeling on both products includes warnings about
avoiding contact with eyes and skin and provides instructions for
first aid.

IANAL, but I wonder what a prosecuting attorney might say about using
wasp spray clearly inconsistent with its intended use.

Bear spray is usually a more potent form of pepper spray.  If you look at
any spray can, You'll see a warning advising the use of said spray for other
than it's intended purpose to be illegal.

On the other hand in Arizona with a CCW permit one can legally carry a
concealed class III suppressed and/or full auto firearm if it has proper
Federal registration and taxes paid.   It would be fairly easy to argue
that is the weapon's intended purpose if it's used for self defense,
especially since (unlike most other firearms)  it's not legal to use for
hunting.

wasp spray clearly inconsistent with its intended use.

~~~~~
I'm not getting it, next we'll have warnings on ball bats, tire-irons,
car bumpers, bottles etc. and the funny thing is we'll abide by it?. I
can see it now, being robbed when changing a tire but geez I couldn't
slug the guy with my tire-iron cause it clearly says (For Removing
Tire &quot;ONLY&quot;) Com'on guys get real, if that's the case just give it
up.

I don't give a hoot if I have to beat an assailant with my shoe or run
him over with my truck, one of us are going down and honestly I don't
give a flip what some district attorney wants to make out of it if I'm
still vertical and he's room temperature. Like everyone else I'm just
a regular Joe trying to make the best of life in my own humble way and
hopefully try my best to follow the golden rule but on the other hand
I'm not going to shiver from the sound of wolves.Life's too short as
it is...

I'm kinda sick and tired of these A-hole scenarios I hear and read
advising what not to do in the name of liability especially when
there's no substance of fact involved, let that contradict your
spontaneous reasoning and reactions for a second too long when your
ass is on the line and know what, ya dead or seriously injured so stop
pondering it over and get serious about your preservation and stop
being brainwashed by the liberals and their threats of financial ruin
or prison that's being embedded in the good peoples mind slowly but
surly. Your falling into their trap like the fly to the spider besides
if the worse did happen and you lost a liability suit or got time in
the hoosegow, &quot;your still alive&quot;, doesn't that mean anything.

Some of you guys don't know how easy you have it. Shall Issue to me is
a blessing from the Gods where any moron can pack a piece to go to
dinner. Back in the day it was one on one and if you had to take
someone down that had the potential to do you harm you had to do it
with whatever means were available and in more cases than none you
didn't have a firearm at the ready.

Geez give me a break, when people start second guess Wasp Spray cause
of what's printed on the label and are seconding guessing due to a
liability beef or what a DA may do, if we're at that stage things are
way out of hand and maybe in the name of public safety some that can
shouldn't even carry a firearm. Makes me wonder what percent of ccw
holders are packing out of a macho image but actually wouldn't use it
in a situation or worse yet, have it taken away from them like candy
from a baby by some street wise hoodlum. From what I've been reading
the last few years it may not be very many that will whole their
ground and if this perturbs some, tough, read the writing on the
wall...

Just like the use of a gun, tire iron, or baseball bat. If you have
justification for using one on an attacker then likely not much will
happen. The problem might be some place like DC where pepper spray is
not allowed carrying wasp spray as a substitute and admitting it to the
law might cause you grief. That too may well be situational, a 5 foot
tall 90 pound nurse going to her car late at night might be seen very
differently form a colors wearing 6 foot 250 tattooed hanging out on a
street corner practicing free trade.

# wasp spray clearly inconsistent with its intended use.

&lt;snip some very good points&gt;

The two times I've needed to defend myself with something other than words
and intimidation, guess what happen? Absolutely nothing. The persons that
started those incidents realized that they had just as likely a chance of
going to jail as I might because I used a product for it's not intended use.
Life is all risk management, if your neighbor is hitting his wife and you
hit him with a crowbar it's very unlikely he's going to call the police on
you. If someone pulls a knife and demands your wallet and you pull a not
technically legal gun on him he doesn't run to closest police officer. By in
large most criminals are cowards and run off just hoping to get away to find
a easier victim.
