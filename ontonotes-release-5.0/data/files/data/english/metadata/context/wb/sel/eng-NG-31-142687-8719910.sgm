Bee Keeper's Wisdom for Human Flourishing

Striving to achieve our mission of health and well-being for all, we can find
inspiration in unexpected places. As bee colonies collapse across the country, some
flourish because beekeepers manage their hives with balance in mind. There is a
valuable lesson here for the way we grow food for people.

What do bee colonies and human communities have in common?  They are both collections
of living creatures with the common purpose of flourishing.  I don’t mean flourishing
in the sense that their numbers grow as large as possible.  This leads to conflict and
competition over scarce resources – not exactly the positive outcome implied by the
term.  Instead, I take flourishing to mean that individual members of these
communities have everything they need to be healthy and content – in whatever ways
they each find happiness.

So what happens if bee colonies have been collapsing like wet tacos all over the
countryside?  There may be a lesson we humans can learn about our own well-being.

Bee Collapse as a Proxy for Human Food Security

In her article, What the Bee Said, Tracy Frisch*  (published in the Valley Table
magazine – sorry, there is not an online version of the article) explored the
mysterious phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder,  which she described as follows:

&quot;Most or all adult bees desert their colony, leaving behind the young, as well as
stored honey and pollen. Inexplicably, neither common pests (such as the wax moth and
hive beetle) nor other bee colonies immediately rob the abandoned hive.&quot;

Theories abound as to the cause of this disorder, which has threatened the livelihood
of flowering plants across North America and Western Europe.  An overview of
contenders has been compiled here by Celsias.com blogger Craig Mackintosh.

Frisch presents an interesting view bearing a frightening resemblance to our
agricultural system.  She interviewed a local beekeeper, Chris Harp of New Paltz, NY,
who described in detail how profit-seeking has compromised the health of commercial
beehives.  What do bees need to flourish?  And how have recent practices been
detrimental?  For starters, there is diversity:

&quot;Bees benefit from a rich habitat with a good variety of flowering trees and weeds
within their two-mile flying range.  Many plants commonly labeled as weeds possess
important healing properties and are rich in nutrients. But in the interest of
maximizing production—and crop pollination—mainstream agriculture long ago developed
an aversion to such diversity.&quot;

Many bee handlers take too much honey out of the hive, supplementing the bees' diet
with a cheap alternative:

&quot;Overzealous honey robbing has given rise to the practice of feeding bees sugar syrup
or high-fructose corn syrup over the long winter and in cross-country transit for
pollination services. From a bee's standpoint, these honey substitutes are inferior
foodstuffs lacking the complex enzymes and minerals present in raw honey.&quot;

Harp’s description of bee handling practices suggests that the immediate cause of
collapse may be a consequence of deeper imbalances that made the bees vulnerable in
the first place.  Other beekeepers surmise the same root cause – as noted in this
Alternet article by Susan Kuchinskas.  Which deep imbalances am I referring to?  The
list should be familiar to healthy food and farm advocates:

* The absence of diverse crops
* Insufficient nutrition in the food supply
* Excessive consumption of high-fructose corn syrup
* Inadequate sources of protein
* Forced confinement of livestock in unnatural dwellings

An artificial production system emerged when pollination &quot;services&quot; and honey became
profitable commodities.  This is similar to the industrialized agricultural system we
use to feed people.  We grow crops and raise livestock in unnatural dwellings
(monocultures for plants and holding pens for animals).  Our food supply is making
people sick – obesity, diabetes, the cancer epidemic, and so on.  The most common
ingredient in the grocery store is high-fructose corn syrup.  The health of our
communities, like the bee colonies, has been deeply compromised.

Unlike insects, we have the ability to recognize patterns and plan for the future.
Our colonies don’t need to collapse before we see that there is still time to change
the course we’re on.

Healthy Foods:  A Progressive Strategic Initiative

We are in the midst of a food crisis.  Luckily, there is a lot we can do to avert
disaster.   In the book Thinking Points: Communicating Our American Values and Vision,
George Lakoff and the Rockridge Institute present the Healthy Foods Initiative as a
broad vision for progressive change.  Here's how it is introduced (Ch. 7):

&quot;Let's make a compact with America's farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and all others who
feed us from nature’s bounty.  In exchange for growing healthy food for our
communities and protecting the sanctity of our earth and our commons for future
generations, we will invest in sustainable farming.  This can be done on a local and
regional level (as it has initially grown), on a state level, or on a national level.&quot;

What does it look like?  Some things we can do include:

* Provide tax credits for farmers who reduce their use of pesticides and
herbicides (This would get rid of the cancer-causing chemicals in our food.);
* Structure our tax policy to promote family farm ownership, rather than absentee
and corporate ownership;
* Subsidize the creation of land trusts for farmers and ranchers who sustainably
manage the land;
* Invest in community gardens to provide a space for growing food in urban areas;
* Shift the purpose of loans and subsidies to guarantee a price for food grown
sustainably.

Human communities can flourish, but only if we promote the common good.  This sounds
like the wisdom of the beekeeper.  Chris Harp helps run an educational organization
called Honeybee Lives.  Its homepage captures the progressive vision beautifully:

&quot;We can learn many things, thru a love and respect for nature.  Honeybees are amazing,
gentle creatures. They live in colonies which function as a single organism, each
Honeybee working for the good of the whole. They nurture the beauty and fecundity of
the earth with their gift of pollination, and through that pollination mankind gains
strength, and nature diversity.&quot;

Healthy food is a common good for all.  We can nurture the beauty of the earth and
feed our children at the same time.  Really, in the long run, we need to do both.

Still the most concise explanation of how we are who we are:

&quot;Let me give you a word of the philosophy of reform. The whole history of the progress
of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her August claims, have been
born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been  exciting, agitating, all-absorbing,
and for the time being, putting all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it
does nothing. If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor
freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the
ground, they want rain without thunder and lightening. They want the ocean without
the awful roar of its many waters.&quot;
&quot;This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be
both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a
demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly
submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will
be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words
or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those
whom they oppress.&quot;
