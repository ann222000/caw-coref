&gt; OK...

&gt; Background. Last summer, I had my 1948 Panhead 74ci plumber style
&gt; manifold replaced with an O-ring conversion so I could install an
&gt; S&amp;S E carb. I didn't do the conversion and the person who did it is
&gt; gone for health reasons.

&gt; He didn't plug the rivet holes. I did a makeshift plug job, but my
&gt; homemade plugs kept blowing out and creating an intake leak. I
&gt; decided to take it apart and fix it.

&gt; Now that it is apart, the adapters seem quite loose inside the
&gt; manifold nipples.

&gt; Questions:

&gt; Is this normal?
&gt; Should I drill and rivet the adapters or do something else?

&gt; One day of unlimited Guinness for anyone with expertise in this
&gt; area.

If you can, use the steel adapters and a Loctite product to seal. If
you want real nice carburettion, use a CV 40 instead of that S&amp;S E
carb.

&gt; The inserts are 1.74 and the inside diameter of the intake on the
&gt; head is 1.75. They flop around and air can flow right by them.  Is
&gt; loctite really going to solve this problem?

No, that won't work. Maybe you have some import junk. I believe I used
to get some made of aluminum and we welded them in. I haven't done any
Pan heads for 15 or mre years, so I'm a bit rusty. Check and see what
Ted's V-Twins from New York state has available. They have a huge
catalog. You can probably Google them up.

&gt;&gt; I hate to do that to '48 heads. I'll try replacing the plumbing

&gt; Don;t blame you, OTOH, if you have some time, I could talk to a friend
&gt; and see if possibly he could cut some &quot;custom&quot; fit nipples out for
&gt; you, but the heads would have to be there,
&gt; and I'm warning DO NOT BE IN A HURRY, at least then they would be a
&gt; tight fit

&gt;&gt; style manifold and the Linkert first. I suspect they might have been
&gt;&gt; leaking as well. If that's the case, I'll weld.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. I figured these heads were pretty beat up when I bought it
&gt;&gt; but it seemed OK until I tried to change things.

&gt;&gt; I could spend the big bucks and get brandy new heads made out of
&gt;&gt; modern steel. I might even be able to keep the valve covers from
&gt;&gt; leaking in that case.

&gt;&gt; And while I'm in there...

&gt; NONONONONO

&gt; that is how I started out (while I'm doing
&gt; this.......................)

Can these be made on a lathe ? Seems to me that with good measurements a
machinist wouldn't need the old/original part ...

&gt; 1.75 ID on the receiving part. It should be makeable. The more I
&gt; think about it the more I am convinced that somebody stretched out
&gt; the nipples over the years by over tightening the plumber type nuts
&gt; while the heads were hot. They were a royal pain in the ass to get
&gt; off.

&gt; It may be time to take a real close look at the heads and decide to
&gt; weld in o-ring nipples. The cooling fins and the exhaust ports are
&gt; all good. They lasted 59 years. I guess they should be good for
&gt; another 59.

Well , it may be heresy , but before you make the plunge , do some research
on hi temp thread forming resins . As an alternative , have you considered
one of the RTV compounds ? I had some that held up to the heat of Shovelhead
exhaust port gaskets , might be something to think about . Apply liberally ,
snug 'em up , and let it cure . Squeezeout can be trimmed with a razor blade
.
Anything's got to be better than the leak you described . Bet it didn't
idle very well ...

&gt;Other than making custom parts or welding O-ring inserts, I can't

Buy another set of threaded inserts with rivets n' O-rings.  V-Twin
part# 7344-6, suggested retail $45.27.  If ya have th' same problem,
send 'em back and have a set made.  Any half assed machinist could
make 'em.

Back in th' early 80's I decided to do th' same swap as you've got.  I
destroyed th' old stock inserts gettin' 'em out.  When I tried to
install th' new ones... oops, wrong size.  They only made repops for
FL's and my EL heads have a smaller ID for inserts.  Fuck.

So I went up th' road to a machine shop and th' guy made me a set
while I waited.  Charged me $20.00 and a sixer.

&gt;Sal went through four sets and found each one to be a little
&gt;different. He finally found two that fit well enough to use. That,
&gt;along with a couple of plugs for the rivet holes (the ones with the
&gt;nut on the outside) and I'm back up and running.

There ya go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No need to mess with the heads this time.

Or ever, IMHO, unless they're cracked.  Make th' inserts fit th'
heads, not vice versa.  That concept goes for any mods to th' old
iron.  If it can't be returned back to a stock configuration, I won't
do it... unless it's already fuckered up beyond restoration.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I wonder who is making these things. We found they varied by as much

Korea, China, Taiwan, etc... whatever's th' cheapest source at any
given time.  Ain't this global economy grand : /

&gt; yes and no err yes uhh ;let me explain &lt;g&gt;,

&gt; if the heads are wore the standard nipples you can buy anywhere won;t
&gt; fit tight,  yes the can be made on a lathe, but to make a goof tight
&gt; fit you really needs those heads to match up threads, or at least to
&gt; be sure the heads aren;t wore that badly,   I would bet at this point
&gt; the nipples (I like talking about nipples) are not the part that is
&gt; loose, it is the head that over the last 60 years has the wear.

&gt; just a hunch because i have seen this a couple times on the plumbing
&gt; fitting heads,  have also seen em with a small hair line crack that
&gt; that would let air leak past the intake

I see your point , each one would be a custom fit to the port . A moot point
, since his mechanic (and it takes a mechanic , not a &quot;tech&quot; to work on
these) picked thru the parts until he found a couple that worked .
