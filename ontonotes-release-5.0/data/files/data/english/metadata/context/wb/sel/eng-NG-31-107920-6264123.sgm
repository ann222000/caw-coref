Restricting F1 to hydrogen fuel would be a start.  Hydrogen has less
volumetric energy density than hydrocarbon fuels, presenting F1 designers
with packaging challenges.  In addition. some of the hundreds of millions
presently spent on design features with little relevance to transportation
of people and goods would go toward improved fuel storage, combustion
management and refueling hardware.  BMW is currently offering H2 fuel
options on a small number of series 7 sedans, using liquid H2 fuel.  Other
options such as high-pressure storage and chemical storage in a metal
hydride matrix would be engineering options for F1 design teams.

The exhaust from H2-fueled engines is free from greenhouse gases such as CO2
and pollutants like CO.  There are oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust but a
significantly reduced concentrations.

Clearly the genius of present F1 design teams with the immense financial
backing of auto manufacturers would be well-employed in such endeavors.

Solar power? Wind power? If you solve the storage problem, you could
generate your own hydrogen in your back garden, store it in a tank and
only need to visit a fuel station when you're short of fuel away from
home. I think Honda already have a home refuelling station that runs off
mains electricity; converting it to renewable power is just a case of
applying a suitable amount of cash.

I didn't say it was simple, I said it was a case of applying a suitable
amount of cash. I disagree about wind power - the problem of wind power
for general use is that it's inconsistent, but if your intention is to
generate hydrogen as and when it's windy and store it, in a larger
quantity than you can fit in the car, and you have the tech to do so,
then that's not a problem; in fact, it makes it an ideal problem for a
wind generator. As far as solar is concerned, the efficiency is limited
by the technology, not by thermodynamic limitations, so it is a question
of requiring more research. The main problem with local generation of
power and fuel is that no serious player in the market wants to support
it, for obvious reasons.

But technological advancement doesn't make all things possible. People
who are naive about science think this, but the reality is that
technology has always developed in some ways and not others. While our
advancement in computers has been especially amazing, what about energy
transmission across space. If we could do this, cars wouldn't need their
own energy source, and this would be true for other appliances as well.
However, while energy transmission across space has always been a dream,
it has never become a reality.

How do you know that converting water to hydrogen without massive energy
expenditure itself is going to be like the computer and not energy
transmission across space, ie, will never be possible??

Wind power - so everyone is going to have a 50m tall turbine in their

As far as solar, they have been trying to come up with more efficient
solar cells for DECADES - and there is massive incentive to produce more
efficient solar cells. Perhaps the failure suggests that it really isn't
possible? There are limits to technology, you know.

I can already buy a much much smaller one than that, that outputs 240V
electricity, and that the makers claim will save me money on my electric
bill:

http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/bq/nav/nav.jsp?action=detail&amp;fh_secondid=9...

Admittedly 1kW isn't much (and I have no real idea how much electricity
is required to generate hydrogen in any quantity, have you?), but I saw
a guy on Dragon's Den who was trying to get investment in a very high
ratio gearbox, that he said would make wind turbines much more
attractive - they didn't get it at all, but no doubt someone will pick

If I can go to the petrol station and fill a load of petrol cans, and
take them home - and I can - then is it really much more dangerous,
provided it's fully locked down so you'd have to go at it with an axe to
get in? In any case, hydrogen tends to burn, unless you mix it with a
large quantity of air - the Hindenburg didn't go off like a bomb. It's
the storage that's the issue, but properly handled, it shouldn't be more
dangerous than petrol, with the only real problem being that you can't
see the flames. We let people have natural gas supplies which are
actually intended for producing an open flame, which could go out
resulting in an explosion when they next use a light switch, and most of
the time they don't manage to blow themselves up.

Well, by law, here you can store up to 20 litres of petrol at home, in
approved containers. Of course, petrol has a smell, as has gas being
scented, to make sure that the user will notice any leakage and take
appropriate measures to avoid an accident. What does H smell like ? :)

The Hindernburg didn't really burn on hydrogen, and the hydrogen
wasn't what caught alight. It was the canvas sealant/paint which
turned out to be a highly flammable one, even when dry and the fire
was "probably" started by a cigarette/cigar/candle.
Still, the area where the fire started has produced a rather large
explosion, which was the hydrogen in just perhaps 2 chambers and the
fireball was almost twice the width of the ship !
From there on, the airship burnt mainly on itself. It lost a large
amount of it's H before it could even catch alight and this was due to
it being stored in compartments. Each of which as the structure was
collapsing from heat, burst and allowed most of it to escape. Once in
the air H disperses very quickly and that, combined with the above
mentioned design of the Hindenburg is probably what saved the ground
crew. Had all the H have gone up in one big bang, none of the crew
running away underneath would have had hair left on their toes.

Which is why storage is such a big issue. The most important thing is
that there should be no leaks - which probably means that you can't have
a cylinder with pure hydrogen in it living in your garage. That's not

Hold on just a minute.  Water vapor is the biggest greenhouse gas.
Should we be adding more water vapor to the atmosphere?

Which are the top three atmospheric greenhouse gases?  Gee, CO2 isn't on
that list!!

What is the contribution of carbon dioxide to global warming?

How much of that contribution is due to man?  How much to natural /
biological sources?

Would we actually have global warming if man weren't on earth?

Would the rate of global warming be much different?

How much did man contribute when this cyccle of global warming began
(15,000+ years ago)?

Please answer these questions with some VALID scientific evidence.

When citing research, don't use the one that often gets quoted.  They
changed the math calculations to fit the desired results - see the
appendix for their admission.).

The question isn't related to the destination.  We are in a warming
cycle consistent with historical evidence, even the rate is the same
(even less than some recent cycles).  The only question is whether
there's a chance that man will have as much as a slight influence on the
rate of change.

With this in mind, just how much influence on global warming will F1
contribute?  How much CO2 will F1 produce when compared to the fan's
vehicle traveling to the track?

The real question is how much is global warming being used by
environmental groups as a rallying point for fund raising?  Initially
they said man was the cause of global warming.  Science proved that false.

Scientists offered cash to dispute climate study

Ian Sample, science correspondent
Friday February 2, 2007
The Guardian

Scientists and economists have been offered $10,000 each by a lobby
group funded by one of the world's largest oil companies to undermine
a major climate change report due to be published today.

Letters sent by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an
ExxonMobil-funded thinktank with close links to the Bush
administration, offered the payments for articles that emphasise the
shortcomings of a report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC).

That's not true of more than a handful - and if they were funded by oil
companies then you would be right to put your suspicious hat on until
the work was repeated and extended elsewhere. But when you have a large
number of mostly government funded scientists (and government funding
over here is largely decided by how much you publish, not by what's in
it) all saying the same thing, you cannot say that their scientific
integrity is all compromised and remain credible. Publication is, by the
way, dependent on doing something new or different or that goes against
the established work, not by being a sheep - no journal worth reading
would publish a paper that basically consists of "What he said". In
short, your attitude is one of someone who buys the conspiracy theories
peddled by people who are just as selective in their use of evidence as
the scientists whose arguments you impugn.

There are methods to store gasses, including hydrogen, which entail the use of
metallic pellets.  You can have a full tank of hydrogen in that form and fire
incendiary bullets into it with no explosive effect whatsoever.  Although there
is leakage, there would be leakage with petrol or any other fuel as well.

If you don't understand science, then don't post about it. For your
information, science works by peer review - both in terms of
publications and grant reviews. It is well known that the best way to
get grants and publications is to endorse the position of the people who
are reviewing your work. On the other hand, if your work sets out to
criticize or debunk these people's work, obviously they are not going to
be interested in supporting it. Try reading Thomas Kuhn's "Structure of
Scientific Revolutions" to understand how social factors rather than
evidence often determine the progression of science.

&gt; No, but they get paid by the funding organization to do research that

So how come European scientists that are funded by their government, with no

That's a very jaded view of peer review. My experience of peer review
has been that people are only quick to point out where there are
mistakes or conclusions that are not adequately supported by the
evidence presented in the paper - which usually means going back to the
literature to find additional supporting work done by someone else.
Obviously people have their own hobby horses, and the comments you
receive often reflect the interests and previous work of the reviewer.
But I've never known a reviewer to go beyond that and say that the
results I have generated are wrong because they don't show the same
things as their work - the truth is really that if you are going to
contradict an already peer reviewed and widely accepted theory, then you
have to have very good evidence that says you're right. That is the
purpose of peer review, otherwise, what you get is wikipedia, where
anyone can write whatever they like.

I remember a conspiracy theory program on TV that investigated the
furore surrounding the researchers who claimed to have developed cold
fusion. No one would accept their results, no one managed to repeat
their results, no one wanted to publish them or fund them. At the end of
the program, they had managed to get some poor idiots to pay them to try
to make a bigger "cold fusion reactor", and, well, the lack of any news
on that front is surely a point in favour of peer review. And in the
case of climate change, there should be companies just lining up to pay
money to any credible scientist who will stand up and say that we're not
contributing to global warming at all.

WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (IPS) - Like the tobacco industry that for decades denied a
link between smoking and lung cancer, ExxonMobil has waged a "sophisticated and
successful disinformation campaign" to mislead the public about global warming,
according to a major new report by the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists
(UCS).

The report, which echoes similar charges made by Britain's Royal Society in
September, found that the world's largest publicly traded corporation
contributed nearly 16 million dollars between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43
advocacy groups that questioned the increasingly solid consensus that greenhouse
gas emissions contribute to global warming.

Among the most prominent recipients were the American Enterprise Institute
(AEI), to which Exxon-Mobil has contributed more than 1.6 million dollars; the
George C. Marshall Institute (630,000 dollars); and the Competitive Enterprise
Institute (CEI), which has received more than two million dollars, more than any
other beneficiary.

With often overlapping directors, advisors, and staff, the 43 groups, according
to the report, have acted as an "echo chambre" that, with the help of right-wing
media, such as the Wall Street Journal, and columnists, deliberately spread
disinformation about climate change.

The 63-page report, "Smoke, Mirrors &amp; Hot Air", called on the new Democrat-led
Congress to hold hearings on the company's alleged disinformation campaign, just
as its predecessors exposed the tobacco industry's storied efforts to block
government regulation of its products.

"ExxonMobil has manufactured uncertainty about the human causes of global
warming just as tobacco companies denied their product caused lung cancer," said
Alden Meyer, UCS's director of strategy and policy.

"A modest but effective investment has allowed the oil giant to fuel doubt about
global warming to delay government action just as Big Tobacco did for over 40
years," he added.

Indeed, according to the report, even some of same individuals involved in the
tobacco industry's efforts contributed to ExxonMobil's campaign.

Steven Milloy, for example, whose Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (ASSC)
was created by tobacco giant Philip Morris in 1993 to raise questions about the
link between second-hand smoke and cancer, has served as a member of the Global
Climate Science Team (GCST), which ExxonMobil helped create in 1998, and run the
Free Enterprise Action Institute to which the company has contributed 130,000
dollars -- or almost two-thirds of the group's total expenses.

The new report comes amid indications that both the U.S. public and the
mainstream media have become increasingly concerned about global warming and
that the Democratic sweep in November's mid-term elections has shifted the
balance of power in the new Congress in favour of those lawmakers who support
legislation to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

As the world's largest energy company, ExxonMobil has long been a target of
environmental activists, particularly since 1998 when, in the wake of the
ratification by most of the world's industrial nations of the Kyoto Protocol to
reduce greenhouse emissions, its major rivals, notably Shell and BP, began
dropping out of the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), an industry group that
campaigned against the treaty.

Unlike his counterparts in the other oil giants, the company's CEO until last
year, Lee Raymond, was openly disdainful of the theory that the combustion of
fossil fuels was a major contributor to global warming and rejected shareholder
pressure to invest more in alternative fuels.

That same year, Exxon participated in a meeting at the American Petroleum
Institute that, according to a subsequently leaked memo of the proceedings,
called for companies to provide "logistical and moral support" to dissenters
from the growing scientific consensus regarding the human causes of global
warming, "thereby raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing
scientific wisdom'."

As the new study details, that is precisely what ExxonMobil did over the
subsequent seven years through its sponsorship of the 43 groups which not only
have overlapping boards and advisers, but that also quote from each other's work
in order to achieve an "echo chambre" effect.

One example cited by the report is that of Sallie Baliunas, an astrophysicist
based primarily at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, which has itself
received nearly 300,000 dollars from ExxonMobil since 1998. A specialist on
sunspots who also is affiliated with at least eight other ExxonMobil-funded
groups, she is best known for co-authoring a 2003 paper alleging that
temperatures have not changed significantly over the past millennia.

That article, according to report author Seth Shulman, "was rebutted by no fewer
than 13 of the scientists whose research she reviewed. They all claimed that she
had misrepresented their work," according to Shulman, who noted that the paper's
findings still show up regularly in the materials published by other ExxonMobil
beneficiaries.

"These groups promote spokespeople who misrepresent peer-reviewed scientific
findings or cherry-pick facts in an attempt to mislead the media and public into
thinking there is vigorous debate in the mainstream scientific community about
global warming, when in fact there is none." added Meyer.

Like Mulloy's Free Enterprise institute, some of the groups, such as the
Hearland Institute, the Annapolis Centre for Science-Based Public Policy, and
the Centre for the Defence of Free Enterprise, are small organisations for which
ExxonMobil provides a substantial -- from 20 percent to 60 percent -- proportion
of their total budget.

In a letter to the company in September, the Royal Society, Britain's most
prestigious scientific group, called on ExxonMobil both to stop financing such
groups and disseminating its own "inaccurate and misleading" materials about
climate change. A Society spokesman claimed that the company had pledged to stop
financing the groups at a meeting in July.

Nor are UCS and the Royal Society, as well as environmental groups, alone in
calling for the company to end its financial support.

In an October letter that explicitly compared ExxonMobil's tactics to those of
the tobacco industry, Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Republican Sen.
Olympia Snowe urged the company's new CEO, Rex Tillerson, to "end its dangerous
support of the [global warming] deniers" and "repudiate its climate change
denial campaign and make public its funding history."

The letter was strongly denounced on the editorial pages of the Wall Street
Journal, which is closely allied to AEI, as an effort to stifle scientific
debate.

In a statement issued Wednesday, company spokesman David Gardner charged that
UCS report was "yet another attempt to smear our name and... to connect
unrelated facts, draw inaccurate conclusions and mislead the audience with a
fiction about ExxonMobil's true position."

"What is clear today is that greenhouse gas emissions are one of the factors
that contribute to climate change, and that the use of fossil fuels is a major
source of these emissions," he said in a lengthy statement that also stressed
that most of the organisations funded by ExxonMobil "are independent of their
corporate sponsors" and that "our financial support does not connote any
substantive control over or responsibility for the policy recommendations or
analyses they produce."

At the same time, CEI, the company's main beneficiary for climate-related
issues, denounced the report as "mostly rubbish" and accused the UCS, as well as
other environmental groups, of "trying to silence anyone who disagrees with
them."

So what you're saying is that if an organization with a motive or
interest in the outcome contributes to research, the results should be
ignored.

How much did environmental groups that have a vested interest in the
results of research (for purposes of fund raising and additional
government grants), should we trust the results of the research they
fund?  Especially when the researchers ADMIT that they manipulated the
results by changing the computations?

I question research with open admissions in the manipulation of data to
get to the predicted results.

Looks ike the same applies to environmental groups trying to increase
contributions by starting a big scare.  But evidence points to a warming
rate that's the same as previous cycles.

So when man contributed to global warming during the last warming cycle
(slightly higher warming rate than this one), what was the outcome?  Are
we repeating man's errors during the last warming cycle?  (TFPIC)
