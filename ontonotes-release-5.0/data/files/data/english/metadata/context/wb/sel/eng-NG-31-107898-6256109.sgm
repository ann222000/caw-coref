I've been using a passive attenuator for my CD player for awhile.

This article indicates that may not be a great idea...

http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/14109/14109.html

The line that caught my eye..."This plainly showed the amount of the
distortion, such as 71.45 nV at 2.2 kHz, with a 10k load. (It degraded
to 200 nV with a 1k load.) ".

I have no idea whats on the output of my AMC CD-9...probably not an
LM4562....but loading it up whatever it is, may not be a great idea.

So Scotty, tell us some details about your passive attenuator, such as what

Pretty impressive distortion numbers.  Is this setting a new standard

What's the impedance of your passive attenuator ? Some op-amps are indeed more
bothered about low impedance loads than others.

Not necessarily at all. 5535 family devices were designed to drive 600 ohms and
some of the 455/6/8x family were designe dto drive as low as 400 ohms.

Arnii freed himself from his obsession by dispensing with music. His
reliance on test tones and pink noise means he can "evaluate" stuff inside
of 5 minutes and be done with it.

Which is still negligible.

However, it supports many reports about CD players not being able to
drive (pre) amplifiers with a lowish input impedance.
Though the NE5532 is quoted to be able to drive 500 ohm loads, I found
that in critical applications and high demands on output voltage, the
load should be at least a factor 10 higher.

Sony at one point specified a *minimum* load at the outputs of their
CD players of 50 kohm.

IIRC, those were NE5532s as well.

Otherwise, a decent opamp. Decent, not excellent.

Might be a 5532, possibly an OPA2134.

The LM4562 is a killer, BTW.
I received my samples the other day, and I am just playing around with
them a bit, in a balanced/unbalanced converter.

Very good test results, and good sounding as well.

Of course, all evaluations are done sighted, so you can dismiss them
at your own peril ;-)

No....I got a chance to hear Marc's Naim a while back which was
smoother than I'm used to...seemed like the edge that some CDs exhibit
was mellowed....but it still lacked some pop and rythym.  Kind of hard
to judge as I wasn't real familiar with the rest of his system.
I'm not trying to attack 16/44 as deficient...but something isn't quite
right in the digital mastering process.    I always get the feeling
that somewhere along the way that somebody is hitting a level button
where some program is automaticallly bringing every note in a track to
a certain level for mixing.  The dynamic range is there...but its just
too consistent.  Sounds like robots playing.

Anyway....this new vinyl from Analogue Production  of a Steve Hoffman
remix of Fragile is awesome.  Approaches Casino Royale for realism IMO.

I use the Sony TA-1000ESD digital preamp, which uses 5532 outs.  I found an
enormous improvement in buffering the output of this piece with an analog
preamp, so that the gain requirement for the TA-E1000 was reduced. The
volume knob for the TA-E1000 is always at less than  the 12 o'clock
position.

Sure it does. I use the external preamp for additional gain. The volume knob
on the external preamp goes up; the volume knob on the TA-E1000 goes down.

I didn't say, "gain of the 5532".  I said, "gain requirement for the

&gt;&gt;&gt; The line that caught my eye...&quot;This plainly showed the
&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of the distortion, such as 71.45 nV at 2.2 kHz,
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a 10k load. (It degraded to 200 nV with a 1k
&gt;&gt;&gt; load.) &quot;.

&gt;&gt; Which is still negligible.

&gt;&gt; However, it supports many reports about CD players not
&gt;&gt; being able to drive (pre) amplifiers with a lowish input
&gt;&gt; impedance. Though the NE5532 is quoted to be able to drive 500 ohm
&gt;&gt; loads, I found that in critical applications and high
&gt;&gt; demands on output voltage, the load should be at least a
&gt;&gt; factor 10 higher. Sony at one point specified a *minimum* load at the
&gt;&gt; outputs of their CD players of 50 kohm.

&gt;&gt; IIRC, those were NE5532s as well.

&gt;&gt; Otherwise, a decent opamp. Decent, not excellent.

&gt; I use the Sony TA-1000ESD digital preamp, which uses 5532
&gt; outs.  I found an enormous improvement in buffering the
&gt; output of this piece with an analog preamp,

Why not cut to the chase Bob, and put on one of your tinfoil hats while
listening? Be sure to paint it red with one of your spray cans. You'll get
an "enormous improvement", if you only believe.

&gt; so that the
&gt; gain requirement for the TA-E1000 was reduced. The volume
&gt; knob for the TA-E1000 is always at less than  the 12

Technically speaking, probably about as bad choice as you could make, if it
mattered which it does not.

Does he mean  "thinks"  or "thanks"

Is it any  wonder I get confused, attempting  to communicate with
"fuck-wits"
No  I apologise,  I  clicked send before I had  time  to change it.  I
shouldn't have called  poor Pauline a fuck-wit,  when every one knows she's
a dumb cunt
