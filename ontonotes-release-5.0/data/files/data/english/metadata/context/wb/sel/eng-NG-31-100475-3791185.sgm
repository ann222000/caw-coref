I have a 1987 Plymouth Caravelle with 20000 Klms (12000 miles) it's a V8
with all the bells and whistles on it, it has not been driven very much over
the last 10 years so the tires are cracking. the question is, in todays tire
market what would be a good tire for this car knowing it won't be driven
very much.

For what kind of driving conditions?

If you drive mostly winter roads, then a snow tire is in order.  If
mostly summer, an all season or even a summer tire can be the best way
to go.

If you are in Canada, then I recommend the real snow or ice tire for
year round because you only drive a little.  The winter tires wear
faster than summer ones, but with low miles, the safety factor with the
winter tires for the 8 months of snow/slush wins out for me every time.
