New drugs hold promise in prolonging lives of recurrent prostate cancer
patients

Washington, Feb 17 : A new study by boffins at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center has found that a new class of targeted anti-cancer drugs that
blocks the human epidermal growth factor (HER) receptor family shows
promise in prolonging the lives of patients with recurrent prostate
cancer.

The drug, a molecular targeted compound called pertuzumab, works by
binding to and inhibiting the function of HER2 receptors, interrupting a
key pathway that leads to cancer growth.

As a part of the study the boffins 41 patients with treatment-resistant
prostate cancer who had experienced progression of their disease after
prior chemotherapy were given the drug every three weeks until disease
progression.

MRI and CAT scans were used to evaluate the tumours during the period of
drug therapy. While no shrinkage of tumours was reported, retrospective
analysis showed that survival rate was prolonged to 16.4 months with the
drug as compared to a median average of 10.7 months in a historical
control group with similar baseline prognostic features.

"Advanced prostate cancer is difficult to treat - and the drug therapies
currently available to these patients have not been very effective,
especially in patients whose disease has progressed after chemotherapy
treatment," said David B. Agus, M.D., principal investigator of the
study and research director of Cedars-Sinai's Louis Warschaw Prostate
Cancer Center at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute.

"Pertuzumab may offer a new treatment approach for these patients when
it is evaluated as a tool to slow - not stop or shrink -- tumour growth.

"The theory is that by significantly slowing progression of the cancer,
patients will experience a good quality of life for a longer period of
time.

"Ultimately, we hope drugs like pertuzumab will help us reach the point
where cancer can be viewed as a lifetime disease to be managed much like
AIDS is looked at now. This would be major shift from the current
paradigm for cancer treatment, and is a promising area of research. This
study must be viewed cautiously, however, as we are comparing statistics
from historical control groups," said Agus.

Previous research published by cancer researchers at Cedars-Sinai and
other institutions has shown that pertuzumab affects the growth of
several other types of cancers, including breast, ovarian and lung
cancer, and that the drug may also prolong survival for patients with
advanced ovarian cancer

The study is set to appear in the February 20 issue of the Journal of
Clinical Oncology.

Well, maybe they ought to try them on men EARLY in their recurrence!
The damn problem is that they don't test doodly-squat on hardly anyone
but hormone-refractory Pts. By that point the PCa is probably
widespread. I bet RP or RT would not be very effective either if you
waited until that point. :-/ Why not try this stuff on Pts for whom it
might make more than a 6 mo. difference? Like me.

BTW I haven't updated lately, and my news is not good. Although I
reached a milestone 5 years a week ago today, my last 3-mo. PSA went
from 1.1 to 1.6, a 45% increase. I think my honeymoon is nearing its
end. But my Vandy med-onc still says he wouldn't start ant Tx or get
any Dx tests.

I agree wholeheartedly that there is a chance that earlier attacks with
Taxotere or vaccine, etc. might prove to lengthen life for a much longer
time than waiting for the refraction to occur.  However, who is going to
sign up for the studies?  I'm in a perfect spot for the theory to be tested,
but what if I take taxotere now and all it does is make by immune system so
weak that cancer just takes over.  Right now I'm at 0.04.  Why risk it?

You have had a very slowly rising PSA pattern (other than that one in April
2006) for years.  But, I don't recall you ever mentioning radiation
treatments.  Did you ever try that?

Steve, you might remember that I signed up for a chemo trial shortly after
my first hormone injection. 1st injection on May 8, 2004, 1st chemo infusion
on July 5, 2004. I did not wait until I was hormone-refractory.

All I know is that the two mets that appeared in April 2004 are gone and
have been gone since March 14, 2005.

Time will tell in this waiting game of ours.

Gourd Dancer,

Are you still on hormone therapy too, or did they stop that when
they gave you the chemo?  How many chemo treatments have
you had?  Have the docs said anything about how they think the
trial is going?

Thanks.

Bill,

What sort of hormone therapy have you had?  I recall that Steve had
a good response to Lupron which eventually wore off and he had a
slow rise in PSA.  Then he added Casodex and his PSA went down
again.  He's still got other options too, including dutasteride.

Another friend of mine has gone hormone refractory and his med-onc
("Snuffy" Myers) is putting him on a cocktail of second line drugs
including ketoconazole, estradiol and estrogen patches.  Dr. Myers is
very optimistic about getting his cancer back under control for a long
time.

I have not had ANY salvage Tx because I concluded early on that my
recurrence was systemic. Unfortunately, I never had a doctor who
disagreed w/ my assessment :-(. So, following traditional oncologic
practice, I'm sitting around waiting for my PCa to get bad enough
(clinical sysmptoms or at least a very short PSADT) to start ADT. I
would gladly have participated in a trial one of the several Txs that
have few SEs.

Who are the non-traditional med-oncs? We all know Strum, and I guess
Myers, but does anyone know of any others who are well thought of in
the medical community?

Pertuzumab Ineffective in Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer

Allison Gandey

February 5, 2007 — Results of a phase 2 trial evaluating pertuzumab, a
second-generation anti–human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 2
antibody, show that not a single patient achieved the primary end point of a
greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen. "Pertuzumab has no
clinically significant single-agent activity in castrate patients with
hormone-refractory prostate cancer at either of the tested dose levels," the
researchers report in the January 20 issue of the Journal of Clinical
Oncology.

In this open-label phase 2 study, lead author Johann Sebastian de Bono, PhD,
from the Royal Marsden Hospital, in Surrey, United Kingdom, and colleagues
evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of pertuzumab. But in contrast
to previous results reported in ovarian cancer for the product, marketed
under the brand name Omnitarg by Roche and Genentech, the investigators
found it was ineffective in prostate cancer.

In an accompanying editorial, Drs. David Solit and Neal Rosen, from the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York, write, "The take-home
lesson is that there remains little evidence for a significant role for HER2
or epidermal growth factor receptor as the primary driver of prostate
cancers. Given the lack of efficacy seen with these agents, the use of HER
kinase inhibitors in multidrug combinations in prostate cancer patients
should be based on strong hypotheses and preclinical data." They add, "To
maximize the likelihood for success, the studies should be informed by
molecular profiling and mutational analyses of the tumor."

The editorialists point out that it has been common practice in oncology to
empirically test agents that show activity in 1 disease in all tumor types.
"On the basis of historical practices, it is therefore not surprising that
when therapies targeted to molecular lesions in specific tumors are
successful in 1 cancer type, these therapies are then tested in all cancers,
especially if they have only modest toxicity," they note.

Little Evidence for Significant Role of HER2 or EGFR in Prostate Cancers

In the current analysis, the investigators studied 68 castrate men with
hormone-refractory prostate cancer who had not received chemotherapy. A
total of 35 patients were treated with pertuzumab 420 mg administered
intravenously once every 3 weeks for 24 weeks.

Pertuzumab was well tolerated, but at interim analysis, the researchers
observed no prostate-specific antigen declines of greater than 50%, and
recruitment was stopped. A total of 33 patients were then treated at 1050 mg
and again, no prostate-specific antigen declines of greater than 50% were
observed.

In their editorial, Drs. Solit and Rosen ask, "Why have HER-kinase
inhibitors been so ineffective in prostate cancer?" They suggest that
insufficient target inhibition might have been achieved at the dose levels
studied. "Though the activity of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and erlotinib in
ovarian, breast, and lung cancer suggests that target inhibition was likely
achieved with these agents in patients with prostate cancer, it is possible
that the level of target inhibition required to induce an antitumor response
may be different in these tumor types." They note that such a possibility
could be explained by differences in drug-to-target affinity in mutant vs
wild-type cells.

"Alternatively," they write, "the level of target inhibition required to
induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis may differ in mutant cells, which are
oncogene addicted to the target compared with those that are not. Inadequate
target inhibition could have been excluded if pre- and posttreatment tumor
tissue had been collected for pharmacodynamic studies. Such studies were not
attempted, however, likely due to the difficulty of collecting such samples
in patients with prostate cancer."

The editorialists conclude that to accelerate the identification of
more-effective therapies for prostate cancer, efforts must be made to
develop novel minimally invasive technologies that will allow for genetic
stratification of patients in future clinical trials.

Looks like they reduced the dose in Cohort A

9 February 2007
Second generation anti-HER2 antibody fails in HRPC
Castrate chemotherapy-naïve patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC) failed to respond to an antibody that is an established treatment for
breast cancer, UK researchers report.

The investigators administered a second generation anti-human epidermal
growth receptor 2 (anti-HER2) antibody, pertuzumab, to 68 patients in a
phase II trial.

Pertuzumab was administered to 35 patients (Cohort A) at 420 mg every 21
days, following an initial dose of 840 mg, and to the remaining 33 patients
(Cohort B) at 1050 mg every 21 days.

Co-author Johann Sebastian de Bono (Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton) and team
report that, after three cycles of treatment, not a single patient had
achieved the primary end point of a 50% reduction in their prostate-specific
antigen level.

Pertuzumab halted disease progression in 12 patients in Cohort A, who had a
median progression-free survival (PFS) of 88 days, compared with 43 days for
Cohort A as a whole.

Pertuzumab halted disease progression in 10 patients in Cohort B, who had a
median PFS of 81 days, compared with 43 days for Cohort B as a whole.

The antibody was nevertheless well tolerated, de Bono et al report in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology.

"The most common adverse event assessed as related to pertuzumab was grade 1
or 2 diarrhea (37% in cohort A and 48% in cohort B; in addition, one patient
in cohort A suffered grade 3 diarrhea), followed by fatigue," they note.

In an accompanying editorial, David Solit and Neal Rosen (Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA) commented that novel methods
for sampling and genotyping HRPCs must be developed if targeted agents such
as pertuzumab are to effectively treat the condition.

I might be seeing something of the same increase in my case. I'm happy
to say that my med onc will listen to me.

Maybe it's time to shop for a replacement for that med onc, who is
perhaps waiting for the tumor to grow and flourish before trying to
treat it.

Here's some study material from PubMed at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed

"High-risk localized prostate cancer: a case for early chemotherapy." by
Gleave & Kelly. PubMed ID 16278471.

See also the "Related Links" on the right side of the page.

Good luck to us both.

Yes, I remember, Mike.  And, if I had a tumor, then I'd do more than just
consider the possibility.

Alan below is the method:

Each course of chemotherapy lasts for 8 weeks. Patients were treated in
weeks 1, 3, and 5 with doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 as a 24-hour intravenous
infusion on the first day of every week in combination with ketoconazole 400
mg orally 3 times a day daily for 7 days. In weeks 2, 4, and 6, treatment
consisted of paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously on the first day of every
week in combination with estramustine 280 mg orally 3 times a day for 7
days. After completion of 3 courses of chemotherapy, hormone management
medical castration plus casodex (at the completion of chemotherapy)] is
initiated at the start of chemotherapy and for a total of 24 months.

The only modifications to above is that I stopped Casodex six months after I
started and I did did stop hormone management.

The studies with this method range from first occurance, first re-occurance,
with start of HT, and HT refractory. Thus far it appears that the earlier a
regime is started the more dramatic the results. The working hypothesis is
that androgen independent clone exists at the time of androgen deprivation.
If this is accurate then it makes sense to attack both when tumor burden is
minimal. Now this makes a lot of sense to me!

Also, you are hopefully treating an micro-metastatic fibers that are loose
and floating around in the vascular system just waiting to land.

In otherwords, the studies are attacking before a foothold multiplies.

Thus far, I continue to show improvement at a rate that is three times what
was expected or experienced by those with a far greater amount of disease.
At this point I am still on HT and have been since PSA exploded back in '04.
I asked about coming off and the genral feeling was why? It's working, why
take a chance that the PSA rises. The thought process here is that as long
as the PSA is surpressed and the mets are gone, then that is a positive.

What I want to hear more of is what I heard last January, "I simply can not
find any evidence that you ever had cancer."

Bridges will be crossed later, right now it is nice to have a remission.
