F1 : 2007 French GP - Lap by lap report
Written by FiA
Sunday, 01 July 2007
* Pre-race: Adrian Sutil, 21st in qualifying, fails to leave the grid for the formation lap.

* Lap 1: On pole position for the fourth time this season, Felipe Massa makes a flying start as fellow front-row qualifier Lewis Hamilton drops to third, behind Kimi Räikkönen. Robert Kubica annexes fourth, from Giancarlo Fisichella and Nick Heidfeld. Jarno Trulli barges Heikki Kovalainen into a spin at the hairpin: the Finn pits for repairs at the end of the lap, Trulli hobbles in to retire. Nico Rosberg completes the lap in seventh ahead of Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Mark Webber, David Coulthard, Scott Speed, Alex Wurz, Takuma Sato, Christijan Albers and Adrian Sutil, who starts from the pits. Anthony Davidson and Tonio Liuzzi collide on the approach to Turn Two: Davidson spins and retires to the pits while Liuzzi remains beached in the gravel.

* Lap 2: Massa leads by 1.4s. Alonso passes Rosberg.

* Lap 4:  Massa leads by 2.2s. Wurz passes Speed.

* Lap 5: Alonso passes Heidfeld for sixth but can’t make the move stick. Sato passes Speed.

* Lap 8: Massa laps in 1m16.623s to stretch his lead to 3.4s.

* Lap 9: Massa posts a 1m16.523s. His lead extends to 3.6s.

* Lap 12: Massa goes faster again: 1m16.398s. He leads by 4.0s. Third-placed Hamilton trails Räikkönen by 1.9s. Alonso remains bottled behind Heidfeld.

* Lap 14: Both Ferrari drivers set personal bests: Massa a 1m16.341s, Räikkönen a 1m16.611s. The gap is 4.3s.

* Lap 15: Massa laps in 1m16.229s, Räikkönen in 1m16.524s.

* Lap 16: Both McLarens pit, but they are far enough apart for it not to be an impediment. They rejoin seventh and ninth.

* Lap 18: Sato pits.

* Lap 19: Massa, Kubica and Fisichella pit. Räikkönen leads. Sutil passes Albers.

* Lap 20: Räikkönen posts a 1m16.207s. Rosberg pits.

* Lap 22: Räikkönen and Heidfeld pit. Alonso attacks Fisichella but the Italian holds him off. Massa resumes the lead.

* Lap 23: Alonso passes Fisichella.

* Lap 24: Massa leads Räikkönen by 2.0s. Hamilton is third from Kubica, Button (yet to stop), Heidfeld, Alonso, Fisichella, Rosberg and Barrichello (also yet to stop).

* Lap 26: Kovalainen pits.

* Lap 27: Schumacher pits.

* Lap 28: Alonso gets alongside Heidfeld, but there’s no way through. Wurz pits, as do both Spykers. Albers rejoins with his fuel hose still attached and pulls off at the pit lane exit.

* Lap 30: Webber and Speed pit.

* Lap 32: Alonso briefly gets ahead of Heidfeld again, but runs wide and has to slot in behind once more. Button and Coulthard pit.

* Lap 33: Alonso finally passes Heidfeld. Barrichello pits.

* Lap 34: Alonso posts a 1m16.819s, a personal best: the Ferraris are lapping in the 1m17s/      1m 18s as they negotiate traffic. Sutil pits.

* Lap 35: Half-distance. Massa leads Räikkönen by 1.2s with Hamilton a further 6.1s adrift.

* Lap 36: Alonso posts a 1m16.495s.

* Lap 37: Hamilton pits, as does Alonso.

* Lap 38: Hamilton is overtaken by Kubica as he rejoins, but he repasses the Pole at the hairpin.

* Lap 39: Alonso runs wide off the track, but only briefly.

* Lap 40: Massa leads Räikkönen by 2.6s. Sato pits.

* Lap 42: A new fastest lap for Massa: 1m16.099s.

* Lap 43: Massa pits.

* Lap 44: Räikkönen leads Massa by 21.6s. Hamilton is 9.3s adrift of the Brazilian.

* Lap 45: Kubica pits.

* Lap 70: Räikkönen scores his second win of the year, 2.4s clear of Massa. Hamilton records his eighth podium finish in as many races. Kubica, Heidfeld, Fisichella, Alonso and Button, who scores Honda’s first point of the campaign, complete the top eight.
