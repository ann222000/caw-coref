I was re-watching Buffy and in season 3 the big bad is a guy wanting to
become a full demon. He has to do certain rituals and pay off other
demons, this got me thinking what would it take to become a dragon?

Any thoughts?

This assumes that one is not already a dragon, does it not? :P

For me, coming into physical contact with my TrueForm is all I need.  For
others, it might be simpler or more complex, I don't know.

Well here's a few off the bat:
Sleeping on a dragon's hoard, you've got to be selfish. (Narnia:
Voyage of the Dawn Treader)
Getting bit by a dragon, but it possesses you. (Shadow of the Dragon:
Dragon's Kiss)
Drinking heart of the dragon elixir, but this one also makes you evil
(The Dragon Society)
Killing your father and stealing his wealth (Fafnir)
Find your ancestors are dragons in disguise (Jake Long)
You can't (Baxil's Draconity FAQ)

There's always the classic way, but it's too late for that. }:=8D

Dragons, please add your finds. In popular and not so popular media.

Well, if you could get the Xala to co-operate, some of their yellow crystal
would do the trick in less than a day (assuming that you have some precise
specification of the species you want to become; I do not know the details.)

:-P

You can get a fair amount of modification in the right direction done with
current medical technology, and in a couple of decades you should be able to
get appropriate cybernetics.  This takes lots of money and surgery.

There is already someone who has made a cybernetic tail, but it is purely
external (not anchored to the spine), so it tends to wobble about when it
flexes.  It also gets through lots of batteries, though there is a good
control system available (without any sensory feedback).

For a totally different approach to slightly different ends, research lucid
dreaming.  There is a whole wiki on it somewhere.  You wouldn't become a
dragon from anyone else's point of view, but you would feel like one when
you were dreaming yet would (AFAICT) be properly conscious.  That will take
weeks/months of practice.

Finally, you can have one as an avatar in Second Life or similar, and/or you
can be a furry and dress up as one, and/or you can pretend to be one online.

That enough ways?

Yes.

Magic rules would be those of Buffy universe.

Not all dragons are evil so something for Good, Bad, and/or neutral
dragons.

I was kicking around a story or gaming idea set in the Buffy universe.

The ethical implications of that are grey, of course.. but what the
