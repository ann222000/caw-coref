Interesting (apparently true) combination of selected elements from &quot;rabbit
set on fire by malicious yahoos runs under their truck and sets it on fire&quot;
and &quot;squirrels chew on electric wires and cause blackouts.&quot;

Squirrels in the mountains of Moraga don't even recognize peanuts
as food.

I wrote this brief, once, for the Vancouver Sun:

August 14, 2006: Maple Ridge, BC, Canada - A squirrel paid with its life
Monday for causing a power failure in Maple Ridge that briefly left
16,000 BC Hydro customers without electricity. The squirrel got into a
Hydro substation by squeezing through a fence, climbed onto a piece of
equipment, received a severe electric shock and tripped a breaker, said
Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Moreno. Asked about a fire reported at the
substation, Moreno said, &quot;That would be the squirrel.&quot; Some Hydro
equipment was scorched but there was no major damage. The squirrel was
toast.

Your 'Lectric company's pole-mounted transformers (those big grey -
usually - cans) are notorious squirrel eradicators.  Cavorting about as they
are want to do, squirrels passing over transformers have been known to make
fatal mistakes, their front feet contacting one  of the protruding posts,
while their little back paws are touching another....

ZAP!
