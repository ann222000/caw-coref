Pitching For More Dead Americans: A Neo-Con Fetish
The Ward Churchill of the demented right-wing has a deathwish for
terror in order to unite the country

Prison Planet | August 10, 2007
Paul Joseph Watson

Another feverish Neo-Con has come out of the closet and admitted to
enjoying the fetish that he shares with scores of other Administration
apologists - a deathwish for more terror and more dead Americans in
order to unite the country behind Bush.

&quot;ONE MONTH from The Anniversary, I'm thinking another 9/11 would help
America,&quot; laments Stu Bykofsky in his Philadelphia Daily News
column .

&quot;Remember the community of outrage and national resolve? America had
not been so united since the first Day of Infamy - 12/7/41.

We knew who the enemy was then.

America's fabric is pulling apart like a cheap sweater.

What would sew us back together?

Another 9/11 attack.

It will take another attack on the homeland to quell the chattering of
chipmunks and to restore America's righteous rage and singular purpose
to prevail.&quot;
That's right - we need more terror or the terrorists will win!

Bykofsky is disappointed that 600,000 plus dead civilians along with
thousands of slain troops in Iraq isn't enough to convince Americans
that the war should be prosecuted with more vigor, so he's yearning
for a kick up the backside in the form of thousands of dead Americans
at home.

One could be forgiven for being cynical and thinking that Bykofsky, a
plodding Neo-Con hack who nobody had heard of before last night, was
just pushing the boat out in a desperate ploy to get a link on the
Drudge Report, but reading his previous frenzied Bush administration
boot-licking columns it becomes clear that Bykofsky actually means
it .

Bykofsky screeches about the perils of &quot;global terrorists who use
Islam to justify their hideous sins, including blowing up women and
children,&quot; and then invites them to slaughter more Americans - and
even helps pinpoint the targets they should attack!

&quot;The Golden Gate Bridge. Mount Rushmore. Chicago's Wrigley Field. The
Philadelphia subway system,&quot; gushes Bykofsky.

Perhaps he should volunteer to send his own kids into those targets as
jumbo jets are slammed into them, since Bykofsky is so eager to
witness more American blood spilled in the name of the empire.

Or is there a greater threat? If Bykofsky has the courage of his
convictions behind him, would he be willing to strap himself with
explosives and run into a crowded shopping mall for the good of the
country?

Obviously not, but only in using such extreme examples as a parallel
can we begin to fathom the vulgarity of Bykofsky's remarks.

Lt.-Col. Doug Delaney, chair of the war studies program at the Royal
Military College in Kingston, Ontario, recently told the Toronto Star
that &quot;The key to bolstering Western resolve is another terrorist
attack like 9/11 or the London transit bombings of two years ago.&quot;

The same sentiment was also explicitly expressed in a 2005 GOP memo ,
which yearned for new attacks that would &quot;validate&quot; the President's
war on terror and &quot;restore his image as a leader of the American
people.&quot;

Last month, former Republican Senator Rick Santorum suggested that a
series of &quot;unfortunate events,&quot; namely terrorist attacks, will occur
within the next year and change American citizen's perception of the
war.

And the month before that, the new chairman of the Arkansas Republican
Party Dennis Milligan said that there needed to be more attacks on
American soil for President Bush to regain popular approval.

An army of Neo-Cons secretly share the same fetish - they would
exploit a hollow opportunity to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; even at the
expense of thousands of dead dads, moms, sons, daughters and babies.

Bykofsky and his cohorts are so aghast that the majority of Americans
now take them for what they are - maniacal devotees to a blood soaked
and failed neo-conservative doctrine - that they'd rather see innocent
people be blown to bits than admit they're wrong.

In some countries, this kind of demented rhetoric is illegal - it's
classified as glorification of terror in Britain, and their rants are
no less volatile than some of the propaganda spewed by Muslim clerics
who have been arrested and deported for advocating violence.

These rabid blowhards should be thankful that America still clings on
to its first amendment - in the face of a terrorist assault that they
encourage - otherwise they would soon find out that openly pitching
for mass murder doesn't sit too well with the authorities.

Bykofsky has just written himself into history as the Ward Churchill
of the delirious right-wing and the two share a lot in common.

Both express the uncanny ability of being able to match the ignorance
of their comments with the depth of their depravity.

Whey then did Bush invade another nation that had NOTHING TO DO with 9/11 or
ANY terrorist act against the United States?

Since we knew who the enemy was, it MUST have bween entirely out of
corruption, greed, insane thinking and even more insane politics to invade
and occupy Iraq.

From the article in question:

&quot;Because the war has been a botch so far, Democrats and Republicans are
attacking one another, when they aren't attacking themselves. The dialog
of discord echoes across America.

&quot;Turn back to 9/11.

&quot;Remember the community of outrage and national resolve? America had not
been so united since the first Day of Infamy - 12/7/41.

&quot;We knew who the enemy was then.

&quot;We knew who the enemy was shortly after 9/11.

&quot;Because we have mislaid 9/11, we have endless sideshow squabbles about
whether the surge is working, if we are &quot;safer&quot; now, whether the FBI
should listen in on foreign phone calls, whether cops should detain
odd-acting &quot;flying imams,&quot; whether those plotting alleged attacks on
Fort Dix or Kennedy airport are serious threats or amateur bumblers. We
bicker over the trees while the forest is ablaze.&quot;

All true enough.

Why the hysteria over telling the truth as one sees it--especially in an
opinion piece from a local paper?

BTW, as far as we can tell, especially from this article, Bykofsky is a
conservative, not a neoconservative.

People tend to misuse the term &quot;neoconservative&quot; almost as much as they
misuse &quot;al-Qaeda.&quot;

Perhaps when he states:

&quot;Is there any doubt they are planning to hit us again?

&quot;If it is to be, then let it be. It will take another attack on the
homeland to quell the chattering of chipmunks and to restore America's
righteous rage and singular purpose to prevail.&quot;

Perhaps, just perhaps, he's referring to you.

It's a well known fact that the President of the United States intentionally
delayed orders to Pearl Harbor leaving the Japanese with the element
of surprise.  Pearl Harbor was as avoidable (or at least as diminishable
in effect) as was 911.

That requires a multifold answer... but suffice it to say that it was done for
the sake of the Oil companies who financed the governmental Coup D'Etat
on the USA in 2000 and put him in power, followed by revenge for his father
having been threatened by Saddam with assassination.  We put Saddam
in power to control the idiots in the region, and replaced him with the idiot
from the USA.

King George W. Bush has instead given them &quot;freedom&quot;...   freedom to
kill one another for religious and sectarian tribal reasons, freedom to kill
one another for local jurisdictional powers, freedom to kill one another for
rights to local oil reserves, freedom to kill one another for seats in the
possible future Iraqi (non-US dictated) government, and the freedom to
put all of those differences aside long enough to kill the occupiers of their
land... the US Military and the corporations that support them.

&quot;Freedom&quot;  ...ain't it just grand?

Unquestionably so... while the media brainwashed the masses into believing
that an entire people were responsible for the acts of a few extremists and
that Saddam Hussein (who despised Al Quaeda) was intimately tied to the
'patsy' known as Osama bin Laden.

The &quot;enemy&quot; of stability and freedom is in the White House now...

It's a pretty sure bet that it will happen, and within the next 6 months.
many think it will come dureing the western US nuclear response drills
that are coming up.  You see... George W. Bush has just signed a
Presidential Directive (of which the actual contents are to remain
&quot;secret&quot;) that gives his the right to assume 'dictatorial' powers.

Google away........   NSPD51  &amp;  HSPD20

The recently enacted National Security Presidential Directive 51 allows
George Bush to establish an immediate dictatorship, including taking control
of all functions of federal and state government, private sectors, and including
at the 'tribal' level, if there is ANY catastrophic *natural* event or terror attack
on US soil.

Presidential Directive is new 'emergency act' ( NSPD51 &amp; HSPD20 )

I can't beat that.... but the republican party was essentially hi-jacked in 2000

That's like trying to say that the entire US backs the fruitcakes now taking up
valuable space in the executive branch.  They allowed 911 to happen at the
WTC, and contributed to it by falsifying flights 93 and 77 and imploding

The writer's arguments are pretty ineffective as far as I'm concerned.

I think he's over reacting to what he sees as failures in Iraq and
waning support on the home front for the greater war.

Those who require a second 9/11 event probably wouldn't be significantly
changed by one at any rate.

The greatest accomplishments by mankind haven't required, nor were they
achieved by majorities, anyway. The American Revolution, for instance,
had only 1/3 active support in the colonies.
