My docs all know that I'll be out of town for the next 3 days.  What
does one, the one who hassled me over paying for the legal mumbo-jumbo a
year and a half ago, decide to do over the weekend, armed with this
knowledge?

He decides to start playing catch-up on all the workers' comp reports he
hasn't dictated for months.  I got 15 WC reports and 5 records reviews
from him.  All of this is more hours of work than I have before leaving
tomorrow morning.

This doc has been behind on these reports since before I went on
vacation at the end of August.  I'll do what I can today, but he can
wait a few days for the others.

Of course, he probably expects them to be done overnight.  Yeah, right.

Grr...

So typical for some.... It's rude and IMHO shows a gross lack of
respect. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an
emergency on mine...

Happens to me all the time.  I don't think my clients know or care
that I'll be gone -- if they're in the mood to play catch-up, they do.
It's no skin off my back; I still turn it around when I can, and as
long as I've notified them that I'm gone, it's not my problem.

That's exactly what I had to do when I had docs that regularly
withheld a few days and then jumbled them all together on a series of
tapes. I finally just told them that I would do the equivalent of an
average day's worth of dictation each day and catch up the rest simply
as soon as possible. I did tell them that if they preferred work be
done on OT hours or on weekend hours, the rate went up, but it was an
option for them to choose if they desired a quicker TAT.
