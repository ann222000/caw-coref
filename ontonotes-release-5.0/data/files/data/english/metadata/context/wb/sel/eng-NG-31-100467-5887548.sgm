Hello,

I am completely new to astrology, but I would like to take it up as a hobby.
I think it would be great to look at the moon, stars, and planets from my
backyard but not sure if the cheaper telescopes on EBAY would do well with
all the lights in the Bay Area (Calif)?

Should I buy a used, beginner's telescope on EBAY (up to 75x), or buy a new,
more powerfull telescope eventhough there are bright lights where I am?

Any help about purchasing a telescope would be appreciated !

Thanks, Kent  kento ... @yahoo.com

You'd be better off taking that question to an astronomy forum.
I'm not sure how many astrologers actually spend time looking
at the sky - there must be some, but not a whole lot.

I enjoy astronomy &amp; astro-photography myself, BUT you have posted to
the wrong list.
This is an astrology list, not an astronomy list. You may have better
luck on another list, such as news://sci.astro.amateur.

For what it's worth, I would recommend you get something a little more
powerful than 75x. That would be ok for looking at the Moon and maybe
Mars, Jupiter &amp; Saturn, but if you want to check out anything any
farther out than that, you're going to be disappointed. Luckily, even a
cheapy telescope from Wal-Mart can be had that allows up to 150x -
300x.

Anyway, there are a LOT more issues involved in buying a telescope
besides its magnification factor. You would be much better off to
discuss the issues in more detail with other amateur astronomers on the
newsgroup I mentioned above.

It a shame, really, that more astrologers don't get away from their
computers once in a while and actually look up at the sky. :)

You probably have and astronomy club near you. Go to one of their
viewing nights where they have several telescopes of different kinds
that you can look through. They're usually happy to tell you everything
about them and advise you what to get for your buget.

Just don't mention astrology (as apart from astronomy). They just glaze
over and the night will end up rather subued.

The intimate dialog between astrology and the sky has long ago been
forgotten. This why all we have now is a flattened 2D ecliptic starkly
absent of stars and other celestial bodies.

You ask or you state your subject? Why the question mark in it? Is it b/c
Americans use the question intonation when making a statement?

In a normal speaking fashion you can do perfectly well w/o it, actually is
incorrect to use it as it is here.

Hi Dan,

Are you aware that the period (.) is next to the question mark (?) on
an American keyboard?

It's possible it was merely a typo. :)
