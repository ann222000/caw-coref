Hey all,

I'm currently a druid in Fearûn. The game is ran by a friend of mine.
In the mean time, I am working on my own world called Aerwald. Now,
this lead to some discussions towards the other players of the
campaign; what are the advantages of a premade campaign and what are
the advantages of a self constructed campaign?

I'd say, in a premade, the time you spend on it can be foccused on
storylines, research and plotlines. In a selfdesigned, on the other
hand, a lot of time must be put into the world itself; deities, magic,
planes etc.

On the other hand, a selfmade campaign can change everywhere you want
it too. You feel more free to insert your own inspiration and ideas
into the campaign rather then mess up the premade one.

Discussion opened! =)

I say start in a premade adventure, then take it in a home made direction.
Sprinkle in a few appropriate premade modules at the right time, and stir
violently until the crap seperates from the sweet creamy nougat ..... err I
mean from the good storyline. Premade modules have the advantage of
pretty balanced CR as well as backstory. Just a few changes and it is in
your homebrew world. And if you can't explain it away, there is always
the Inn of the World Serpent to drag your adventurers between realities.

You seem to have answered your own question, really.  The fact that you
want to design your own world is good, but it must be balanced with a
realistic assessment of your available time.  If you don't have a lot of
time, a pre-made world is the easiest way to start, but you can morph it
over time into more of your own creation.

One way to approach this is to start in a pre-made world and work on
your own world in your spare time.  When it's ready, have a
planar-travelling adventure that ends up there.

I started my world in 1993 and played weekly until about 2004, so 11 years
of pretty much constant world building has created a very different and
colorful world.

I always reccomend building your own world. How we did it was simple, my
group are all GMs
anyhow so we all agreed to take a chunk of the globe and develop it through
game play.

Originally my area was suposed to have an aztec feel, but it ended up more
imperial feel, where
as the viking type area ended up as greek and the Minataurs are viking... go
fig hehe

I digress, Make a simple background story of the world and the gods (if you
use gods) and
then just start writing small one or two nighter campaigns to get a feel of
an area. Use the same
characters only send them to other parts. Also if you have many creative
people in your group,
let them take a piece.

Granted you get a few times where you have to call together your group for a
consortum to
debate whether or not your goblins should have electricity........ But you
get the idea... If you
create a world as a group it helps strengthen the group and give it a true
multicultural feel.

A premade world also has the benefit of a shared experience beyond the
immediate gaming group. Much like a STAR WARS group can find it really
cool to visit the Death Star construciton site prior to A NEW HOPE,
players in Faerun may find a meeting with Drizzt Do'Urden extra
special. More generally, players' extant experience with the setting
-- whether through other gaming groups or novels -- may help to make
the world seem more vibrant and alive.

On the flip-side, in order to benefit from these advantages, you can't
deviate from the established canon of the setting. And the more
familiar your players are with the setting, the tighter the
straitjacket becomes. When this happens you don't end up saving prep
time -- you simply spend your prep time studying the session so that
you can be faithful to it.

Premade settings also benefit from a wealth of detail. Achieving this
wealth of detail in a homebrew will either be difficult or impossible
for you to accomplish in a self-made world (depending on the setting
you're talking about).

When handled properly, the prep time for a self-made world is not
severe.

For example, when I created my current campaign world, I:

(a) drew up a rough map of the world;

(b) I wrote up a 8-page document that described the major geographical
divisions I had drawn on the map (in single sentences, 1 page); the
five major empires I had put on the map (one paragraph each, 1 page);
the calendar (1 page); a timeline of known history (1 page); the major
gods and religions (2 pages); a description of coinage (1 page); and a
list of languages (1 page). Then I threw in an extra page describing
the monkish traditions, since I knew one of my players wanted to play
a monk.

That took an afternoon. Then I grabbed the exceptional THREE DAYS TO
KILL module by John Tynes (published by Atlas Games), did standard
prep work on that, and played the first session. After that, I mapped
out the first act of the campaign, consisting mostly of published
modules, and worked up the supporting material I'd need to surround
them.

Over the course of five campaigns, I've developed several hundred
pages of notes and maps for the campaign world (not including the
actual adventure prep for each campaign, which can fill volumes all by
itself). That 8-page document has been expanded to 15 -- the timeline
of known history has grown in size; the calendar has become more
complex; the gods and their religions are more detailed; I've added a
page on common slang -- but it still serves as the core touchstone for
the campaign. It's still the first handout every new player is given.

My point here is that there's no need to duplicate a 300-page setting
document before you can sit down to your first game session. And the
vast majority of the details I've developed for my campaign world have
developed as a direct conseqence of prepping something for an
adventure. ("Hmmm... The PCs are about to get involved in Imperial
politics. I guess I should figure out how the government works,
exactly.")

So I guess, for me, the breakdown of advantages and disadvantages
looks like this:

1. Premade Campaigns: The advantage of a wider shared experience
beyond the gaming table.

2. Selfmade Campaigns: Making it up is easier than studying.

a premade campaign has a lot of material already written and ready to
be used.  the downside is that you have to go buy it all.

so, how much free time do you have, vs. how much cash?

i generally prefer to create my own worlds, because a) its more fun for
me, b) i know my world intimately well, and c) i can do anything i
want, without fear of conflict with future published material.  (you
can still do anything you want with a published setting, of course, but
when new material comes out, you'll do work adapting it to your own
changes.)

with your own world, you can also start small and work on building it
out as you need to, as the campaign progresses.  detail one town and
the next-door dungeon, think about the surrounding country and what its
like in general, and paint the rest of the world in broad one-sentence
strokes until it becomes important.  keep track of where the party's
going, and add detail as needed.

all that said, i've just started a new eberron campaign, and i'm really
looking forward to it all.

Pre-made campaigns have most or all the details worked out for you in
advance.  The DMs job is to familiarize him/herself with the material and
ensure cohesiveness between modules.  In a pre-made campaign, more time is
available to emphasize the player character and protagonists.  Emphasis on
plotlines, outside of just understanding it, comes in home-made campaigns.

In a home-made campaign, you start everything from scratch.  You design the
world, including a world map (and often several regional maps where the
campaign begins, etc.), you select the deities involved, you design a
plausible storyline not only for the campaign as a whole, but for each
individual adventure.  You must also design the NPC-types and select or
design any monsters the party will face.  The home-made campaign requires
more work, but you have more control over the environment.

If you're wanting to develop a home-made campaign, you should consider using
certain software tools.

Use a mapping program of your choice: Campaign Cartographer, AutoRealm,
Dundjinni, or so on.  Develop your world.

Select the predominant races in each region you design.
Then work on the background using such tools as:

MasterPlan, TableSmith, DM Secretary, Role Playing Assistant, and so on.

You can then work up the encounters for individual adventures and their
rewards by rote, by random, or by one of many programs available for these
functions as well.

Selfmade all the way.  If you just 'think' of it as selfmade, and then
incorporate whatever you want from existing sources of premade ones
that you like it becomes much easier.  You can fill in the blanks
quickly, without being forced into a straitjacket.  One easy thing to
do is steal maps and flesh them out with what you want to be there.  I
especially like realworld maps.

I am currently running a loose 'Eberron' campaign, I like many of the
things there, but there are many more I don't like, and there are far
many more I don't have/haven't read, which catches me by surprise
sometimes.

I much prefer selfmade which I'm going back to as soon as my current
campain finishes.  My campaign world has been around a long long time,
and has a lot of history to it, but I've been finding it has a bit too
much history (mostly with powerful characters from the previous
games).  I think I'm going to create a whole new one next time.
