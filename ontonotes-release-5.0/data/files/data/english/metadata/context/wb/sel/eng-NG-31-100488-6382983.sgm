Hi

I have a Citroen Synergie 1999 1.9TD (60k miles) which isn't too relevant
because it has a Peugeot engine which is fitted in lots of cars!

Anyway, when I start it from cold the glow plug indicator lights up and goes
out after about six seconds, if I try to
start the car it just turns over.  If I heat the glow plugs about 4 times,
it is fine and will start (with some white/grey smoke, not much)

If I run it for about 2 minutes, turn the engine off, it starts fine and
will be fine for the rest of the day.

Now, you instantly think it is the glow plugs, well....we had this problem
last winter and had the glow plugs replaced and it seemed ok, but since it
was getting warm, it wasn't really a problem over the summer, again the
problem recurred and took the car to my mechanic, who charged me £35 for him
to diagnose the problem with the computer so that he could fix it!!!  He
said two of the plugs had failed, strange, since they were just over 12
months old, oh well got them replaced and got the car back and it was fine
and then after just a few days the problem is recurring.

I have fitted a new battery as the currently fitted battery was 400 amps
(but healthy), the new one is 700 amps.

Is the problem could be to do with the glow plug relay burning the plugs
out, as it is faulty.  Or could this also have been because the battery was
the wrong one?

Help!!  PS.   I have learnt alot about diesels!

&gt; I would say it's the plugs again. Take 'em out, put 'em across a 12v

supply and they should glow red within 10 secs.
If they don't they're knackered. I suppose if the plugs are on all the time
they will fail quickly, that is to say that the relay is not cutting out
after the appropriate time. You can probably check that by putting a meter
or bulb across the plug which should light then go out after some 30 seconds
or so. They will not necessarily go out when the light on the dash goes out,
that's just to tell you it's OK to try to start the car.

The problem is probably the heater relay burning out. What happens
with these units is that the relay load contacts start to burn, this
in turn causes the relay to heat up, causing the bi-metal strip to
switch the relay off to soon and acting as a resistor in  the heater
plugs supply - IOW a double whammy and a difficult engine to start
from cold!

Total tosh! When the light goes out it does so because the relay has
cut the power to both the warning light and the heater plugs - if the
circuit worked as you suggest PSA could save a lot of money in parts
and labour by just printing "After turning the steering column key to
the 'On' position, count 10 seconds and then start the engine" in the
drivers instruction manual....!

Not necessarily tosh. Some cars keep the plugs on for a short while
after the engine starts to help with cold running or so I'm told.

Do you know what brand of glow plugs were put in a year ago? Some of them
are cheap shite, and a year is a good innings...

You said two of the newish ones have already been replaced - the other two
could well have died.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Unlikely. The amp rating of the battery is mainly to do with the ability to
spin the starter motor on a cold morning. The glow plugs won't draw
anything like that much.

Hi, can't really help you with the starting problem except to say that I
also have a 1999 TD Synergie and its good to know that I am not the only one
on this forum that has one.
I do find that if its been a cold night, then sometimes it will take 2
attempts to get mine running, I find that holding the clutch pedal down
while turning the engine over seems to help.(no idea why this helps). My
Synergie  has 132,000 miles on the clock though ,so I allow it a little
extra to get running.

Might be worth looking at getting the gearbox oil changed, perhaps a
slightly thinner oil put in. What's happening is that - without the clutch
depressed - the input shaft of the 'box is being spun by the starter along
with the engine, and that's sapping some of the "oomph".

You could still have some faulty glow plugs. There are two types of plug
made for these engines, the type for the turbo are made to stay on longer
each start, so will last longer overall. Do not get the plugs for the non
turbo model.
It is also possible that you have a faulty glow plug relay, in that the
light still comes on, but no power is actually being supplied to the plugs.
The only way to test for this is with a voltmeter attached to one of the
plugs while you turn on the ignition.
You can also check the individual plugs by measuring the resistance of each,
but you have to disconnect each one in turn from the supply cable. Faulty
pugs will normally be open circuit. Normal resistance cold is under one ohm.

No it's not total tosh, what you are saying is though.
On all the PSA turbo diesel engines the light goes out after a few seconds
to indicate that you should be able to start OK, but the heater plugs are
kept on for up to a couple of minutes to reduce smoke output. They are
turned off either when the temprature rises in the block enough, or the
throttle is kept above a certain setting for a given period.

Err, except that you are placing a considerable side loading onto the
crankshaft, many cars *wont* start with the clutch peddle depressed
due to this, certainly putting a thinner oil might reduce 'drag' from
the input shaft might you might just end up causing more friction when
the oil breaks down in use and at high temperature!....

On the Renault Megane, the glowplugs can remain on for up to three
minutes after the engine has started depending on conditions. They stay
on always for between ten and thiry seconds after the indicator light
goes out and then depending on engine load and other conditions for a
varying length of time.

Firstly, I am aware that the Haynes manual is not always absolutely correct,
but the post heating is well documented in there.
Secondly, if you look at the Bosch injection pump, you will see a small
microswitch on the top, which is activated by the trottle arm. this is what
turns the post heating off in some conditions.
It is obviously very similar to the Megane engine in this respect.

How does depressing the clutch put a side load onto the crank?

Can you say which cars won't start with the clutch depressed? I've

even one that won't start.

If you need to ask that you must be clueless as to how a clutch works,
or not thinking before pressing 'Send'...!

If you are causing the release bearing to push against and hold the
clutch diaphragm spring compressed (by depressing the clutch pedal)
the crank will attempt to move way from the clutch cover, this
movement will be within the crankcase and cause the crankshaft to be
forced into heavy contact with crankshaft side thrust (end float
control) bearings - this is why they are fitted, an engine doesn't
need these thrust bearing unless there is a side thrust present. It's
also possible to find the opposite happening if light pressure is
applied to the clutch pedal were the engine has end float issues, you
can find slight up and down movement of the clutch pedal.

Many, of all makes and models, fresh from the factory all should start

Well my one has made it to 130,000+ so far. So I think its a little late to
worry about it now, although like I said I don't always start it with the

I'm neither clueless nor unthinking. I find it difficult to accept that
the small additional side thrust encountered in the 5(ish) seconds that
it takes to start the engine has a significantly higher effect than the
side thrust encountered during normal running. Let's face it, it takes
hardly any more time to start the car than to change gear - and you do
that far more times than starting up.

By your reckoning my Series 2a Land Rover with 460,000 miles on the
clock should be on its 7th clutch by now, whereas it's actually on its
second. Likewise, all the Discovery's I've owned should have been on
their 2nd or 3rd - but were still running originals at 150k+. Ditto the
current Xantia with 170k+ on its original clutch.

BTW, the Xantia owners handbook says you should depress the clutch
whilst staring the engine (petrol or diesel) in cold weather.

I never said that all engines would be affected. I've known some
engines that stalled the starter motor if the clutch was depressed at
the same time, OTOH I've known cases were the end float on the crank
was so bad that the clutch would not fully disengage (causing gear
selection issues) but would start quite happily with the clutch
depressed.

Perhaps we are just seeing different sides if the trade, I know a
couple of mechanics who have never come across a truly worn out engine
due to only having worked in main dealers, although they have seen
other faults that rarely get seen outside of main dealers IYSWIM?

I have found only one. In 1991 I drove a Citroen AX330 (cheaper version of
a 2CV) and it did not start with the clutch depressed due to the side thrust.

I do think its a bit extreme to assume not using the clutch to start a modern
car would be a standard practice though. I dont think it really matters and
its safer to always depress the pedal.

You're a 'Peugeot master technician' then? That means you see only new
or dealer maintained cars then, perhaps it's you who needs to do some
nitty gritty stuff rather than spout the pure bollocks - if the dealer
doesn't see the faults they can't exist...

I once had an argument with a BMC/BL senior parts manager as he could
not accept that one could have a loose gear on the distributor / oil
pump drive of a Maxi engine - 'cos he had never ever had to supply one
in all his years - until I showed him the faulty one I had on the
bench behind the engine hanging off the crane in front. Or the Ford
dealers workshop manager, in front of engineers from Dagenham, who had
never seen an incorrectly drilled oil-way in a cylinder head before -
even though his workshop staff had fitted three (yes, 3) camshafts to
the same CVH engine in question under warranty - they couldn't
understand why one of the cams failed within a few hundred miles -
quite nice seeing senior Ford Motor Co. management giving a right
bollocking to their dealers rep' in the middle of the workshop of a
small inde garage... :~)

Your personal assessments of me have no bearing on this discussion.
Making the statements that I must be clueless, unthinking or ignorant
without any knowledge of me, my qualifications, experience or occupation
speak volumes to everyone else in this newsgroup.

To date, you have not produced one single fact: just anecdotal evidence
from your experience, so here's a challenge for you.

Name me just one car that has an inhibitor on the clutch pedal that
means it won't start without the clutch depressed as a standard fit item
and just one that works the opposite way.

Eduardo, that doesn't count. My response was to Adrian who said that
some cars are fitted with an inhibitor. Excessive side thrust that
prevents and engine starting may be an effective inhibitor but Citroen
didn't design it in as a feature :-)

Nice try though :-)

&gt;&gt; stuff.
&gt;&gt; kind regards mark

&gt;You're a 'Peugeot master technician' then? That means you see only new
&gt;or dealer maintained cars then, perhaps it's you who needs to do some
&gt;nitty gritty stuff rather than spout the pure bollocks - if the dealer
&gt;doesn't see the faults they can't exist...

&gt;I once had an argument with a BMC/BL senior parts manager as he could
&gt;not accept that one could have a loose gear on the distributor / oil
&gt;pump drive of a Maxi engine - 'cos he had never ever had to supply one
&gt;in all his years - until I showed him the faulty one I had on the
&gt;bench behind the engine hanging off the crane in front. Or the Ford
&gt;dealers workshop manager, in front of engineers from Dagenham, who had
&gt;never seen an incorrectly drilled oil-way in a cylinder head before -
&gt;even though his workshop staff had fitted three (yes, 3) camshafts to
&gt;the same CVH engine in question under warranty - they couldn't
&gt;understand why one of the cams failed within a few hundred miles -
&gt;quite nice seeing senior Ford Motor Co. management giving a right
&gt;bollocking to their dealers rep' in the middle of the workshop of a
&gt;small inde garage... :~)
">

It sounds like the motor trade would be lost without you !. I do nitty gritty
stuff EVERY day of my life so do all other master techs.  we don't always
just see dealer cars or dealer maintained ones. we see vehicles from some
independent garages who don't have the knowledge to fix the vehicles (not
their fault). Maxi engine and cvh engine probs wow SO WHAT??  you've spotted
a fault a dealer couldn't ?? don't you think we see things other dealers or
indep. have missed so what ?? its going to happen . Theirs only one ignorant
person in here and im afraid its you .."In 30 years experience i haven't
HEARD OF POST HEATING" . "Real knowledge is to know the extent of ones
ignorance"

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gary G Jones (ggjggjnos ... @btopenworld.com) gurgled happily,
&gt;&gt;&gt; sounding
&gt;&gt;&gt; much like they were saying :

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do find that if its been a cold night, then sometimes it will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempts to get mine running, I find that holding the clutch pedal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while turning the engine over seems to help.(no idea why this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helps).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Might be worth looking at getting the gearbox oil changed, perhaps a
&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly thinner oil put in. What's happening is that - without the
&gt;&gt;&gt; clutch
&gt;&gt;&gt; depressed - the input shaft of the 'box is being spun by the starter
&gt;&gt;&gt; along
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the engine, and that's sapping some of the &quot;oomph&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Err, except that you are placing a considerable side loading onto the
&gt;&gt; crankshaft, many cars *wont* start with the clutch peddle depressed
&gt;&gt; due to this, certainly putting a thinner oil might reduce 'drag' from
&gt;&gt; the input shaft might you might just end up causing more friction
&gt;&gt; when the oil breaks down in use and at high temperature!....

&gt; How does depressing the clutch put a side load onto the crank?

&gt; Can you say which cars won't start with the clutch depressed? I've
&gt; driven hundreds of different makes/models and ALWAYS depress the
&gt; clutch to start - so as to avoid false neutrals - and have never
&gt; encountered even one that won't start.
">

BMW, Mercedes and Ford very often instruct you in the handbook to depress
the clutch when starting. There are also a few cars about that won't start
*unless* the clutch is depressed.

The Renault Megane with the silly keycard thing won't start unless you have
either the clutch or brake pedal depressed.

I had an Alfa once that wouldn't start no matter what you did to the clutch
pedal :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; missed out on?

&gt;&gt; I have found only one. In 1991 I drove a Citroen AX330 (cheaper
&gt;&gt; version of
&gt;&gt; a 2CV) and it did not start with the clutch depressed due to the
&gt;&gt; side thrust.

&gt;&gt; I do think its a bit extreme to assume not using the clutch to
&gt;&gt; start a modern
&gt;&gt; car would be a standard practice though. I dont think it really
&gt;&gt; matters and
&gt;&gt; its safer to always depress the pedal.

&gt; Eduardo, that doesn't count. My response was to Adrian who said that
&gt; some cars are fitted with an inhibitor. Excessive side thrust that
&gt; prevents and engine starting may be an effective inhibitor but
&gt; Citroen didn't design it in as a feature
">

But it does prove that I am correct and you an ignorant idiot for
doubting that the fault can exist!

That's it, Pete, go and spoil it for me :-)

Here I am amusing myself baiting Jerry and you go ruin it &lt;BCG&gt;

The Megane is so ugly (at least it's rear end is) they should have put n
inhibitor on it so that it wouldn't start unless you were a registered
scrap merchant. No offence intended if you own and/or like the back end
of the Megane :-))  Can you imagine the read end of the Megane married
to the front end of a Fiat Multipla? Now that would be seriously ugly!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not necessarily tosh. Some cars keep the plugs on for a short while
&gt; &gt;&gt; after the engine starts to help with cold running or so I'm told.

&gt; &gt;I've never come across that but then I've only been in the trade for
&gt; &gt;30 years so could have missed some applications I suppose...

I suppose if he has never had to deal with Diesel engines, he would be
ignorant of the modern systems. Well, not quite modern, post heating goes
back at least 15 years to my limited knowledge.
