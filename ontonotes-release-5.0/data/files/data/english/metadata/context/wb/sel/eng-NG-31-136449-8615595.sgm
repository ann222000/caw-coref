Hey Asif, Marshal and the all The Nature Knights, here is a series of Flowers from Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, South of Bangalore, India.
I was eager to go to the VOF, but time and feasibility was not right, but same time I was shooting Flowers too, down south - :)
Love to hear your comments. I was following the Blog and Marshal's album, it was a wonderful experience, and it kindles my desire to go to VOF soon.

Cheers,
Ram
