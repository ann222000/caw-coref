What are the technical reasons why MTBs have not migrated to 30
speeds?  I want to make clear I'm not trying to "advocate" MTBs move
to 30 speeds, just seeking to understand the technical reasons.  That
said however, given the greater variation of terrain while riding a
MTB, I'd imagine that 30 speeds on a MTB would be "more useful/
necessary" than 30 speeds on a road bike.

Wikipedia seems to suggest that there is no 10s chain strong enough to
withstand the rigors of MTB use (search for "30 speed" in following
link).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bike

I was under the assumption that 10spd chains are no weaker than 9spd.
Is this assumption incorrect?

They haven't moved to 30 speeds because the market research firms that
advise the major component manufacturer have not yet indicated that now is
not yet the optimum time to introduce the product.  The only reason to
introduce 10-speed cassettes for MTBs is to sell new product for premium
profits to gullible "early adopter" customers and to create some new and
improved market hype for the mass market.  Planned obsolescence
considerations and creating the need for shops to churn over a new
generation of inventory will eventually drive MTBs over to 10-speeds.

Indexing 9-speeds on MTBs is already finicky enough due to dirt
contamination and rear derailleur bounce in rough terrain.  My favorite
shops #1 customer upgrade is to convert high-end MTBs to Shimano XTR M900
8-speed drivetrains.  Costs an arm and a leg to find these 10-year old
parts, but the wider cog spacing gives more reliable shifting in harsh
conditions.

But in the final analysis, an externally-geared drivetrain for MTBs is
basically stupid.  They are fragile, they are sensitive to contamination,
they result in an inefficient (wide) Q-factor and they require a lot of
maintenance and fiddling.  Internally-geared hubs *should* be the future.
Don't waste your money "upgrading" to N+1 speeds until the industry comes
out with a light, affordable, efficient and strong internally-geared system.

the assumption is correct, the chains are no weaker, but overall, a
finer mechanism is more susceptible to dirt abrasion &amp; clogging, hence
10 may be a little more problematic.

&gt; What's a Q-factor?
">

From Sheldon Brown's site:

"Tread ("Q Factor")

The tread, or "Q factor" of a crank set is the horizontal width of
the cranks, measured from where the pedals screw in. The wider the tread,
the farther apart your feet will be. It is generally considered a good
idea to keep the tread fairly narrow. There are three main reasons for
this:

* The hip joint is optimized for walking, and in normal walking
the footsteps are pretty much in line, with little or no "tread."

* For standing pedaling, the farther out the pedals are from the
centerline, the harder you have to pull on the handlbar to counterbalance
the tendency of the pedaling force to tip the bike sideways.

* The wider the tread, the higher the bottom bracket needs to be
to prevent clipping a pedal while pedaling through a turn.

Older bikes were generally designed to keep tread to a minimum, but
starting in the late 1970s there has been a trend to wider tread, for a
variety of reasons:

* The popularity of triple-chainwheel cranksets has moved the
right side outward.

* Front derailers designed for triple-chainwheels have a more 3-
dimensional shape to the derailer cage, which requires more clearance
between the large chainring and the right crank.

* Mountain bikes have wider-spaced chainstays for tire clearance,
which requires moving the chainwheels outward so they won't hit the
chainstays.

* Newer bikes with more sprockets in back move the chainline
outboard."

http://www.sheldonbrown.com/cranks.html

========================================

Personally, I've never seen any solid evidence that a narrow q-factor is
actually more efficient. Is spinning one's feet in circles really
comparable to walking?  There are people who report pain with a narrow q-
factor, but there are also people who are more comfortable with widely
spaced pedals. Having splayed feet, I prefer the "low profile" of most
wide q-factor cranks (see "Cranks Profile" on that same page on Sheldon's
site).

">

No, counter-tipping the bike puts the force in line with the tires, but the
tip is larger.  The force accordingly is reduced by the cosine of the off-vertical
angle, but also then doesn't result in work being done, and doesn't represent
much more than an impedance change, ie. just makes the cranks act like shorter ones.

The counter-tipping is necessary just as part of balancing, but this reorienting the
bike isn't work.

It's not a pull up in any case, until the bike is tipped as necessary to balance.

The more I think about this, the less convincing it becomes. Efficient
walking may have been the overriding consideration in the evolution of
the hip joint, but it also easily adapts itself to a variety of other
activities.

Right now I'm sitting, and keeping my feet together is downright
uncomfortable. The usual explanation I see for in-line footsteps when
walking is the need to keep the feet below the center of gravity. That
makes sense for a weight-bearing activity like walking. But in cycling,
one takes a good bit of weight off one's feet by sitting. Arguably,
pedaling is more akin to sitting than walking.

No offense to Sheldon or others who tout a low q-factor, but I'd like to
see what medical experts would say about this.

Surely if Q factor matters it will vary depending on the size of the

&gt;That's what I would think. Depending on the width of your pelvis, the
&gt;hip joints are located differently.

Not just width of pelvis but also the length of the legs.  And other

The chain itself may not be weaker, in terms of resistance to wear, but in
terms of failure due to pins not holding, there is a dramatic, not subtle,
loss of durability when moving from 9 to 10-speed. Anyone believing
differently hasn't worked in a shop. In fact, the 10-speed chain pin
installation is so much more critical than with 9 that some bike companies
are installing quick links instead of the supplied Shimano pin when
installing the chains.

Campy has also had some infamous 10-speed chain failures (during the Tour de
France).

10-speed chains are *not* ready for mountain bike use. Making the chain
narrow enough for the space between the cogs, and yet wide enough internally
to fit over the teeth, has resulted in pushing the limits of design &amp;
construction.

This is a repeating pattern:  It happened with the transition from 6-
speed to 7-speed, then again with the transition from 7-speed to 8-
speed, and yet again from 8-speed to 9-speed.

With any number of gears, shifting will be better with a close range
cluster than with a wide range cluster.  Since MTBs use wide range
gearing, the manufacturers wait to get the system debugged and fine
tuned with close-ratio road-racing gearing first before they apply it
to wider range MTB/touring gearing.

It is neither more useful nor necessary.  The move from 5 to 6 to 7 to
8 to 9 to 10 speed clusters have all been to add increments within the

Matt: As I detailed in my prior post, I have to disagree. We're pushing the
edge as we make ever-narrower chains. And perhaps you recall Shimano's first
year with 9-speeds on MTBs... we saw quite a number of bent/folded-over
larger-sized cassette cogs. Just because something works in a relatively
clean &amp; predictable road environment doesn't mean you can expect the same
off-road.

That isn't actually true for mountain bikes.

A typical 21-speed mountain bike transmission had a 12-28 cassette with
24,36,46t chainrings, giving a high-gear:low-gear ratio of 4.47:1or gear
inch range of 22"-100"

A typical 24-speed mountain bike transmission was 11-28 with 22,32,42t, for
a ratio of 4.86:1 or 20"-99"

A typical 27-speed mountain bike transmission is 11-32 with 22,32,44t, for a
ratio of 5.82:1 or 18"-104"

The sprockets of the seven speed cassette (12,14,16,18,21,24,28) are common
to all three transmissions. The 8-speed gets an 11 one end, and the 9-speed
gets a 32 on the other.

Of more practical benefit than the wider total range is that a greater
variety of terrain can be ridden in the middle ring, reducing the need to
drop to the granny gear.

I use all the gears on a 21 speed MTB (7x3), and could use more in the
gaps.   The longer you ride, the more sensitive you are to exactly
the right gear.  It's not even a close call.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

For me, it seems tb the terrain: riding off road, I get such frequent large
diffs in gear requirements that the fine distinctions seem to fade into the
background.

I only have 14 speeds on my FS and they're evenly spaced.  Even so, that's
plenty for me - having tried more and different spacings in the past.

Riding road, OTOH, even I can see the need for more gears and different spacings
- narrower as the gears get higher.    It's been awhile since I spent any
significant time on the road - or on a road bike.. but it seems to me like I
gravitated towards 1-tooth diffs at the upper end... and when I put slicks on my
hardtail and ride pavement, I always wish for a couple extra gears here and
there at cruising speed.

Although I wouldn't state it with such hyperbole, terrain defines the

through a wooded area with little to no elevation change might have cadence
problems with too few a selection of gears.

Are you commuting off-road? If not your comments are really not
applicable. Terrain changes so rapidly when riding off-road that close
ratio gearing is useless.

The only thing I found useful in going from 8 to 9 speed was getting a
34 tooth low (from 32 on the 8 speed). Since I ride a 29er, I need that
34 tooth low gear. Going to 10 speed with the same overall gear range
(11x34) would only give me a more finicky drivetrain. I think 8 speeds
shift better than 9s too.

Second the above, plus:

It kind of boils down to this;

Roadies want and need several close ratios in a narrow band to
maintain a very rnarrow, specific cadence range at a nearly constant
speed.
(39-52/3 -  11/12-23 being a nice tight combo, and quite common).

Gearing for road  =  Narrow range/lots of choices.  (Narrow range of
operating conditions - maintaining cadence important)

Fine, I don't see any problem with that at all, but.........

Mtn, (read typical trail type mtn riders) need only a few choices with
an extremely broad range to deal with all types of terrain.. Cadence,
while  entering  into the picture is also spread over an extemely wide
range when trail riding here in NE.

For instance, on one of my own mtn bikes, I have had a 20t - 32t front
with an 11-34 rear..
(I've been told that it is impossible to stay upright with this low
gear combination, but I guess I didn't listen &lt;BG&gt;)
Have NO big ring at all, and have never gone fast enough (where I
ride) to ever use or need the 32t 11t combo.  I use a small
bash ring on the outside position to get the added ground clearance
which is worth many times the value of the non-existant, (unusable
anyhow) "big" ring. &lt;G&gt;

On another, I have 22t-32t-Bashring and 11-34.. same reasons as above,
but the bike is a little lighter and I can "force it" up a steep
banking or grade a little more easily..

Cadence in these conditions ..........  nearly zero RPM..
The only thing you need to do at zero cadence is to push the bike out
from under you in hopes on gaining enough ground to get to the next
pedal stroke and so on until you crest the hill, rock, whatever or
bail off.

Mountain Bike Action Mag recently did an article on converting back to
8 speed from 9.  Shifting under dirty and adverse conditions was
improved.  Going back to seven would be even better from that
standpoint.
Again a really big advantage off road.  (Same range - fewer steps, and
you'll never miss them - I defy anyone to even notice any difference
in actual use except for the improved shifting in snow, ice, mud,
etc.. )

Gearing for MTN Bike = Wide range / number of choices not important.
(Wide range of operation conditions - any cadence that works under the
circumstances you are in at the time)
Note that you can't really flail a mtn bike through a technical
section at 120 RPM like a roadie in a full sprint on blacktop.

Now let's look at the Single Speeders on my trails around here to tell
us that the whole range of ANY riding conditions can be dealt with
ONLY by cadence.. The extreme example of choiceless gearing..
Pick one, screw it on and go.
I'm not one of them, however. &lt;G&gt;

So you see, you really don't need any gearing choices at all unless
dealing with a very specific situation, and the guy training on the SS
will tell you that he is a better rider on his multi-speed bike
because of it...

Gearing is a very personal thing, and whether you have one speed or
thirty, like to spin or have to grunt or need something other that
what comes stock to ride the bike under conditions that it wasn't made
for, like a mtn bike on pavement, or a road bike by a normal human
being who would like think that he can push a 53 - 11 at 120 RPM but
would be a lot happier with a 48 - 13 and a dose of reality..  &lt;G&gt;

Bottom line.. gear it any way you like.. if you can't get it so you
like it, you probably won't ride it as much as you should....

If you want 30.. get em'
If you like only one.. that's fine too!

Change the casette, change the cranks, get some gears from Sheldon, do
whatever you have to and get off of here and RIDE!!

My road bike is 13-21, my MTB is 12-30, both with 8s clusters; I ride
my road bike on pavement, my mtb off-pavement. I notice the gaps on
the MTB, and 9s would be an improvement, 10s more so. You can't be
making double shifts to find the right gear on a MTB- you need to make
most changes on the rear. Little front ring = very steep uphill,
middle ring = moderate uphill-level, and big ring = level - downhill.
More or less.

It's ironic that I have railed against 9-10s for road bikes all this
time as an ego-marketing gimmick to discover that I think it is
actually useful and needed on MTBs. I think that you reach a point
where you want a certain gear and you really notice it when you don't
have it. Bottomline is that 10s makes more sense on a MTB where the
terrain varies more and the gear ratios are wider. On a MTB more gears
fills gaps, on a road bike more gears add range that is useless for
most people. Just because you need it more doesn't make a 10s chain
strong enough, though.

At the low end of the range, you're describing an improvement of 10% with
each added cog. That's far from insignificant. I'll agree that any small

i don't like quick links because they don't always mesh with cassette

&gt; &gt; I really like those one-tooth jumps. Otherwise I end up either mashing

&gt; &gt; and getting bored. I'm never in any doubt about which is the &quot;right&quot;
&gt; &gt; gear to be in with one-tooth jumps which sort of implies it's not too
&gt; &gt; many gears.

&gt; Although I wouldn't state it with such hyperbole, terrain defines the

jaunt
&gt; through a wooded area with little to no elevation change might have
cadence
&gt; problems with too few a selection of gears.

Exactly. Not to mention those miles on the road to and from the track. For
that reason I have a wheel with a close ratio road cluster.

I think that's right. It's also in very flat places that you

The gears of your Rohloff (and of my Rohloff) are spaced pretty much like
the mid range of a typical modern mtb cassette:

11-12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32.

In fact they're closer in places, though without the duplications and range
overlap. If Rohloff's constant 13.6% jump is taken literally, the gears look
like:

11.0 - 12.5 - 14.2 - 16.1 - 18.3 - 20.8 - 23.6 - 26.8 - 30.5 - 34.6 - etc.

I'm very happy with the Rohloff's range and gear spacing for off-road
riding. Smaller gaps would be no advantage. I could live with larger gaps
between the gears, but I'd prefer not to have to.

&gt; It kind of boils down to this;
&gt; Roadies want and need several close ratios in a narrow

&gt; at a nearly constant speed.
&gt; (39-52/3 -  11/12-23 being a nice tight combo, and quite
&gt; common).
&gt; Gearing for road  =  Narrow range/lots of choices. (Narrow
&gt; range of operating conditions - maintaining cadence
&gt; important)
&gt; Fine, I don't see any problem with that at all, but.........
&gt; Mtn, (read typical trail type mtn riders) need only a few choices
&gt; with an extremely broad range to deal with all types of terrain..
&gt; Cadence, while  entering  into the picture is also spread over
&gt; an extemely wide range when trail riding here in NE.
">

In your description of "roadies", you focus on one particular type of road
rider - the club rider or racer, or wannabe. The mtb equivalent would be the
lycra-wearing XC racer (or wannabe), who may well be riding fast, flat,
grassy courses for an hour or two at high speeds.  There's a far greater
diversity of road riders, and of off-road riders than in the picture you
paint - the alpine cyclosportif with 48-34 and 12-27 or 13-29, for example,
or the transcontinental tourist, or the fixed wheel "fakenger".

I've ridden alpine (road) routes where two gears would have been sufficient:
40" up and 110" down.

I fully agree that cadence is far more variable for a typical off-road
rider, and shifting under load at low cadence is generally far more
important. I don't think that 1-tooth jumps are desirable off road, when it
makes far more sense to grab two 2-tooth gaps at a time than four 1-tooth
gaps, but I think that an 11-32 9-speed cassette is a very good combination
of wide range and moderate jumps. As for 10-speeds off road, I don't think
adding an extra gear in the current range makes much sense, but an 11-38
2x10 might not be out of the question. Losing the granny ring would reduce
the maximum chain tension if chain strength is an issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For instance, on one of my own mtn bikes, I have had a 20t - 32t front
&gt; with an 11-34 rear..
&gt; (I've been told that it is impossible to stay upright with this low
&gt; gear combination, but I guess I didn't listen &lt;BG&gt;)
&gt; Have NO big ring at all, and have never gone fast enough (where I
&gt; ride) to ever use or need the 32t 11t combo.  I use a small
&gt; bash ring on the outside position to get the added ground clearance
&gt; which is worth many times the value of the non-existant, (unusable
&gt; anyhow) &quot;big&quot; ring. &lt;G&gt;

&gt; On another, I have 22t-32t-Bashring and 11-34.. same reasons as above,
&gt; but the bike is a little lighter and I can &quot;force it&quot; up a steep
&gt; banking or grade a little more easily..
">

In bumpy terrain, that's effectively what I'm riding, but the 42t comes
along for the flats, and riding to and from the trails. This isn't, by and
large, a hilly part of the world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Mountain Bike Action Mag recently did an article on converting
&gt; back to 8 speed from 9.  Shifting under dirty and adverse conditions
&gt; was improved.  Going back to seven would be even better from
&gt; that standpoint.
">

I held out against 9-speed for a long time - until all my seven-speed
equipment was worn out, and 9-speed cassettes were available cheaply. I
don't think there's anything to choose between seven and eight in terms of
mud resistance. Nine may be a little fussier in the dirt, but there's not a
lot in it, in my opinion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again a really big advantage off road.  (Same range - fewer

That's what my Rohloff's for.

&gt; Now let's look at the Single Speeders on my trails around
&gt; here to tell us that the whole range of ANY riding conditions

&gt; I'm not one of them, however. &lt;G&gt;
">

I am.

Unless you gear very low, a typical singlespeeder spends more time pushing
or carrying than a typical geared rider. If you do gear very low, twiddling
along on flatter terrain quickly becomes tedious. I enjoy singlespeed a lot,
but there are climbs in the woods I ride in that I can't clean on any
singlespeed I'd care to ride out there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So you see, you really don't need any gearing choices at all unless
&gt; dealing with a very specific situation, and the guy training on the SS
&gt; will tell you that he is a better rider on his multi-speed bike
&gt; because of it...

&gt; Gearing is a very personal thing, and whether you have one speed or
&gt; thirty, like to spin or have to grunt or need something other that
&gt; what comes stock to ride the bike under conditions that it wasn't made
&gt; for, like a mtn bike on pavement, or a road bike by a normal human
&gt; being who would like think that he can push a 53 - 11 at 120 RPM but
&gt; would be a lot happier with a 48 - 13 and a dose of reality..  &lt;G&gt;

&gt; Bottom line.. gear it any way you like.. if you can't get it so you
&gt; like it, you probably won't ride it as much as you should....

I have no argument with any of that.

&gt;&gt; chain pin installation is so much more critical than with 9 that some
&gt;&gt; bike companies are installing quick links instead of the supplied

&gt; i don't like quick links because they don't always mesh with cassette

I've ridden it up to about 80 miles per day on pavement. I find that the
gaps become more noticeable at the top of the range, and the drag is more
noticeable than off road. For longer days on the road I prefer to take my
touring bike, which has a custom 9-speed 12-28 cassette
(12,13,14,15,16,18,21,24,28). That gets me 7%-8% jumps in the 60-100" range.
