Even though temperates in the 80s are predicted for next week on the
Central Coast of CA,  it's getting to be,  &quot;that time of year again&quot;,
and I need to buy firewood!
How much is a cord of wood in your area,  and what type of woods are
used?
Around here,  it costs $250  -  $300 to have a cord delivered,  not
stacked,  just delivered!
I feel like such a &quot;victim&quot;,  when it comes time to pay the &quot;wood
man&quot;!
However,  I don't feel &quot;victimized&quot; enough to go cut my own!  There's
just too much work involved!

It's not that big of a deal to cut your own wood.  I used to do that for my
uncle and step-dad during the summer for extra money.  They had their own
grove of trees to cut from.  These days though, where can one go to cut if
someone such as yourself would like to?  There's christmas tree farms but I
doubt if there would be anything like a firewood farm. lol.

here in michigan it's about 30-40 bucks a face cord, oak and maple.
cutting wood is easy.. its the chopping part that's hard. but you just
cant beat a well stoked fire in the old fireplace when its 0 degrees out
of doors. the maple leaves are turning, the hickories are bare and the
oaks are slow as usual

In Western Montana it's about 80-100 per cord this time of year for Fir or
Lodge Pole pine. Come Jan/Feb, it will be 175ish. The forest service charges
$5/cord for a permit to go cut your own with a 4 cord minimum. My firend and
I spend about 5-6 hours cutting and hauling and get about 5 cords at a time.
A cord of wood saves me close to $250 worth of heating oil.

Just for kicks I'll ask my brother what he sells his for.  He cuts for
entertainment during the winter months and because he also heats with
wood.  First class stuff.  Red oak, white oak, maple, some ironwood.
All split, stacked under cover and dried a couple of years.  When he was
still working, he would haul a trailer load to the Twin Cities after
every weekend at his country place, but just for his pals.  Now I think
he sells it all to wholesalers who come and pick it up.

One of my favorite forms of winter recreation was cleaning up my woods
and cutting firewood.  Had a couple of tractors, 2 circle saws, 2 chain
saws and a couple of trailers.  Usually rented a splitter though or
borrowed my brother's.  The dogs loved it too and would come along and
watch.  Only my first and last dogs volunteered to carry firewood though.

It's not uncommon in my part of MN for farmers to allow you to cut in
their woods on a share basis, provided you have a reputation for
reliability.  It doesn't hurt to drop off fish and game occasionally.

I thought you had your own land?  Plant some trees and you'll have your
own firewood farm.  Black locust grows fast and is not bad for burning.

If you don't have land, buy some.

Back in the '70s, I and another fireman got into the firewood
delivery business in our off days.  At first we cut it, but that
got old quick, and besides it was slow.  Then I discovered a guy
who could deliver a hundred cords at $45/cord in dump truck
loads.  We stacked it out behind the other fireman's mother's
house, and delivered it around town for about $100-$120 a cord.
Actually we sold by the &quot;pickup load&quot; (a little short of half a
cord), which eliminated the nitpickers, but in fact it came to
around the above figure.  Kept us busy on our off days through
two winters, after which we got tired of it and found other
scams.  (He promoted and I took up insulating houses.)

What's the point of this ancient history lesson?

We found that guy in the paper.  He was one of our competitors,
with lots of trees on his family's land, around 50 miles away.
I'd say you might snoop around in the paper and find a guy who
would cut you a deal for quantity, and you might be able to
peddle the rest to neighbors.

It costs you little or nothing to bullshit with these guys a bit,
try to work something out.  Helps to have a big flash roll of
cash in your jeans.

Plan B would be to find a sawmill and offer to raid their scrap
pile.  Probably just be fir and pine, but it burns.  If it's
cheap enough, rent a big Uhaul truck and load it up.

One of the big Uhauls holds about 10 cords.  Ask me how I know.
:o)

Bob, who just this week cut half a cord of elm and pecan limbs
out of the trees in his yard.  And took an equal amount to the
dump.

Seems to burn ok and keeps the house warm at 30 below. Granted there are
better burning hardwoods but the mountains around here are  not covered in
maple, madrona or oak so one burns what is available.

You obviously haven't thought too much about where I live,  have you?
I've only got thirteen acres,  and I've been here 14 years.  I've cut
everything that could be cut!
This is chaparral country.  There's no way to water any trees on
hillsides!
Besides,  a fire came through the place in '02!   It would have got
anything I planted,  even if I had tried....
It sounds like you had it &quot;goin' on&quot; for your firewood!  Why didn't
you ever buy a splitter for your power take off on the tractor?  One
only costs $400 now?
Unless one has almost everything one needs,  (including trees) doing
firewood yourself,  is waaay too much work!

That's because you don't know how to work without working. All you
need is is a PU or trailer, a chain saw, and a splitting maul. This
is the one I use:

Thanks for the helpful tips on how to harvest firewood!
I'm sure you are a &quot;paragon&quot; to manual labor,  and collateral
exercise!
However,  if one doesn't have trees to cut,  all your labor saving
advice is for naught!
As I said,  I've already cut all the wood that can be cut on my claim
during the past 14 years!  There's no trees to fell!
The standing oaks are worth lots more than firewood,  get it?
If any trees,  or limbs come down in Winter storms this year,  I'll
put your advice into action!

I feel lucky. About a 1/4 mile away from my house is a farmer that is
about 80 years old. He and his sons cut wood all year long and have it
stacked in &quot;half cords&quot;. We call it a rick rather than a face cord,
but probably the same thing. I only buy it for taking camping with me.
He sells a &quot;rick&quot; for $35, which fills my full-size pickup truck. I
have to load it, which is the easy part. It is mostly  a mixture of
ash, hickory, oak, no pine.

Most people in my area don't burn pine because of the creosote build-
up it causes. People have a few chimney fires every year because they
either burn pine or only burn their fireplaces for a couple hours and
don't let the old stuff burn off.

I have a splitting maul exactly like yours, and it's seen lots of use.
We heated -- or will heat -- almost exclusively with wood in our
mountain house (four years of full-time living), our carriagehouse
(three years), and our new house (starting this winter).

However, splitting with a maul -- even a good one like that -- can't
even come close to the power and ease of using a hydraulic logsplitter
-- one of the best purchases I've ever made. With it, my wife and I (or
any two-person team) can split a huge stack of wood in a couple of
hours, without either of us getting worn out.

Don, around Salem Oregon, a cord goes from $150 to about $225 with the lower
price you pick up and the higher price is delivered. Most the wood is fir
and oak, with fir about $25 to $50 lower then Oak. I go to a place out in
the country and cut fir and oak for $70 a trailer load. After I get about 2
cords, I rent a logsplitter at Home Depot for $71 a day. So the costs are
$140 for 2 cords of wood and $71 for the splitter which totals $211 for 2
cords. About half the price for split and delivered.

of woods are used?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Around here they all advertise &quot;face cords&quot; of fire wood.
The wood is usually 16&quot; long so 3 face cord equal a full cord.
The price of a face cord of seasoned hardwood varies from $65.00 (you come
and pick it up) to $85.00. (delivered but not stacked)
So that's $195.00 to $255.00 per cord.
I have a wood stove in this house and had one in the last house.
I averaged about 4+ full cord a winter.
A couple of years ago I bought an natural gas unvented heater that looks
like a metal box on legs with fake logs in it.
We have it in the living room and it heats the whole house.
It only cost a few dollars more per month than wood and the only work
involved is to light the pilot light every fall and turn of the pilot light
every spring.
But I found an even better way to keep warm in the winter.........go to
Florida.

Ours produces 40,000 BTUs and a pretty flame, if that's what you want, and
is fan forced so the heat gets into the room. Next to no smoke involved (can
run it during burning bans) and lights at the push of a button. Pellet trees
come ready to use and nicely bagged. No muss, no fuss, no little critters
crawling out of the bark and around the house and no danger to preachers.

&gt; That's because you don't know how to work without working. All you need
&gt; is is a PU or trailer, a chain saw, and a splitting maul. This is the
&gt; one I use:
&gt; http://www.braveproducts.com/itemdetailpage.php?itemid=10328&amp;offset;=0...

&gt; Works great.

&gt; I go fell some trees and quit.
&gt; I go limb and saw up some trees and quit.

&gt; After a month or so, I'm done, haven't worn myself out, haven't had a
&gt; heart attack, and got some regular exercise without having to buy a
&gt; stationary bike and a spandex suit.

&gt; Been doing that every year for 25 years. Except last year.
">

My routine was different.  I filled the big chainsaw and the little one.
Had a box for both in the front end loader in the tractor.  Hooked the
trailer on behind.  When the tanks were empty I had a trailer load of
wood, representing approximately 2 weeks of burning, on average.  Hauled
it home and stacked it in the barn or under a tarp. The larger stumps
were just thrown in a pile until I accumulated enough to justify a day
of splitting.

For the fireplace I preferred red oak that had been dead long enough so
the bark had fallen off.  No popping and no outlaw sparks to burn holes
in the carpet.  I had a small tractor with a circle saw mounted on the
rear, with a trailer behind that.  Picked up pole wood and ran it
through the saw and threw it in the trailer.  Didn't take long to gather
several weeks worth with this method.  I also had a trailer without a
box to haul pole wood home and stack it near my stationary circle saw.

If I only had a half hour before dark when I came home from work, I
could cut a pretty good-sized pile of wood in that half hour.  Usually
threw it directly in the trailer and stacked it near the walkout
basement door.

&gt;&gt;In Western Montana it's about 80-100 per cord this time of year for Fir or

Maple, Oak and Beech all have about 1/3rd more BTU content per cord than
does the douglas fir I burn - about 24mbtu/cord vs 18mbtu/cord for the fir.
The fir gets the job done so it really doesn't matter. The work involved is
minimal - we use an industrial winch with over 300ft of 1/2inch cable
mounted on an old semi to pull the logs up onto the road, cut them to 6-8 ft
lenghts and load them using a bobcat. The semi hauls 4-5 coards at a time
and my truck/trailer combo haul about 1 1/2 cords at a time. This years wood
was about 10 miles from the house so pretty convenient. The exercise of
cutting and splitting is also likely good for me :-). As for using a log
splitter, I can split faster by hand if I am working by myself.

Here's a link to BTU content in wood if anyone is curious.

&gt; We heated -- or will heat -- almost exclusively with wood in our

&gt; However, splitting with a maul -- even a good one like that -- can't

I have a riding mower, but I do an hour or two with the push mower
before I get on it. Some days, I don't use it at all. Depends on how
fast the grass and weeds are growing - and how many procrastinations
I've accrued.

Have you even attempted an experiment of planting a fast-growing tree
like black locusts on your property?

In 1976 I asked the MN State Forester about planting some and he just
laughed.  Said they simply wouldn't grow in my area.  Guess what?  The
expert was full of hot air.  I planted just one and it now has relatives
all over the place.  Suckers will sprout 50 feet from the tree, so you
only have to plant one and if you don't mow, you will soon have a
jungle.  They have huge aromatic blossoms in Spring and critters will
eat the seeds in the small pods they produce.  They also have a few
nasty thorns so they make nice trees to plant on property boundaries.

Cut and dried they make fairly decent firewood and they are fast
growers.  Take a 2 week vacation and you will have an 8 foot tree where
there wasn't any when you left.

felling dead trees, bucking them up to carrying size to toss them in a

I have.
Say a cord of wood is 3500 pounds.
I burn about 3½ cord per winter.
That's 12,250 pounds of wood.
So if I cut my own wood, I pick up 12,250 pounds of wood and load it into a
trailer.
Then I unload 12,250 pounds at home.
Then I pick up 12,250 pounds when i split it.
Then I pick up 12,250 pounds when I stack it.
Then I pick up 12,250 when I throw it into the celler.
Then I pick up 12,250 pounds when i put it into the stove.
That's 6 times I have handled that wood.
That's 73,500 pounds of wood I handled each winter I cut my own wood.
Now that I am older, I just turn a little dial on the wall and it gets warm

Yeah, but Kerry can turn out cow chips a lot faster, I'll bet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . . . .what I did was find a tree surgeon who call me when he had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tree to remove.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would go there with my trailer and they would load my trailer for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some times I would run home, unload the trailer and return for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another load.

&gt;&gt; Will:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a similar deal.  Love it.

&gt;&gt; bh:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll bet the preacher does, too.

&gt;&gt; He does, but he doesn't mention &quot;the incident&quot; as often as you do!

&gt; That's because he's a preacher and has to turn the other
&gt; cheek...umm...leg, and I'm not and don't have to.

&gt;&gt; BTW, our &quot;tree surgeon&quot; has one of those machines that will reduce a

Careful which quotes you use JerryD.  I didn't say those words above.
