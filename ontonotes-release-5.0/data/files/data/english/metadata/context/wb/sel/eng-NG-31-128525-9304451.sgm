CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON ALL THAT IS GOOD

Mark 14:38 &quot;Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.&quot;
MARK 14:38

Temptation is linked directly to what we think upon (Heb. 11:15). Temptation has to be entered into. We can avoid temptation by avoiding thoughts that generate temptation (Prov. 23:7). Since it is impossible to not think, we cannot just try to reject the negative thoughts in this world, but we must choose to think on the positive truths of God. This is where prayer comes in.

In prayer, we have our minds stayed upon God and therefore, are not receptive to thoughts that conceive temptation. Temptation or sin must be conceived (Jas. 1:14-15). In the physical realm, the easiest way to avoid an unwanted birth is to avoid conception, so it is in the spiritual world.

It is easier to avoid being tempted by being in constant communion with God, than it is to overcome temptation once it has been conceived.

Paul admonishes the Philippian believers to reflect and meditate upon eight positive principles of thinking that will lead to a victorious Christian life. These are things that are &quot;true,&quot; that is: honorable, truthful and upright. Things that are &quot;honest,&quot; that is: honorable, truthful, genuine, not characterized by deception or fraud. Things that are &quot;just,&quot; that is: in accordance with what is right, or right conduct; any circumstance, fact or deed that is right. Things that are &quot;pure,&quot; free from defilement or impurity.

Things that are &quot;lovely,&quot; pleasing, agreeable, inspiring love or affection. A &quot;good report,&quot; that is: a saying or report that is positive and constructive rather than negative and destructive. &quot;Virtue,&quot; which is moral excellence, righteousness and goodness. &quot;Praise,&quot; or what is praiseworthy; expressing one's esteem of a person and his virtues. We need to focus on the good in every area of our lives. Recognizing God's hand in even the smallest things will bring peace and keep our hearts and minds following hard after the Lord.

Days of Heaven on Earth

There is a natural law of sin and sickness. If we just sink into the trend of circumstances we shall go down and sink under the power of the tempter. But there is another law of spiritual life and physical life in Christ Jesus to which we can rise and through which we can counterbalance and overcome the law that bears us down. But to do this requires real spiritual energy, fixed purpose and a settled posture and habit of faith. In the factory that relies on a single source of mechanical power, it is necessary to engage the belt that turns the central shaft and keeps it engaged. The power is there, but only if the connection is maintained is it usable power to operate the machinery. There is a spiritual law of choosing, believing, abiding and holding steady in our walk with God that is essential to the working of the Holy Spirit either in our sanctification or healing. There is a word that saves the soul, &quot;I will trust;&quot; It makes the sick and suffering whole, &quot;I will trust.&quot;

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free-Romans 8:2

God's Proving Ground for Faith
TGIF Today God Is First, by Os Hillman

He did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience. - Judges 3:2

God brought the nation of Israel into the Promised Land of Canaan through Joshua. After Joshua, there came an entire generation who had very little experience in fighting battles like the ones fought by Joshua. Training and testing God's people is one of God's important strategies that enable His children to succeed in spiritual warfare. This is why we do not live a life free of trials. These trials are sent specifically to see if our faith is real or simply empty words.

&quot;They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the Lord's commands, which He had given their forefathers through Moses&quot; (Judg. 3:4). God allows circumstances to develop around your life to give your faith opportunity to be proven. It is only when we are tested in battle that we become skilled warriors. You can be confident God will allow trials to come your way through situations like an unreasonable boss, a client who refuses to pay, a false assault on your character, or a difficult relationship that requires unconditional love. These battles are sent your way to test what you know in the mind in order that they might become part of your heart.

You will discover if you have passed the tests or if you need more battles that will give you the opportunityto learn the art of spiritual warfare. Do not fear these battles that are before you. God has already given you the victory if you choose complete dependence and obedience to Him. Then you will become one of God's greatest warriors, skilled in spiritual warfare.

Today's Prayer
November 9, 2007

Dear God, Thank you for caring so much that you sent your Holy Spirit to touch me and live within me, sealing me unto the day of redemption. Thank you that there is an Intercessor and Savior, praying for me and standing in my stead when I do not even have the words to say. Sometimes, there is just so much to pray for, so many needs or so much heartache, that I just do not know what to pray. But you know my heart. You know my needs. You know the needs of those for whom I am burdened. Father, I come to you now offering words of praise and thanksgiving, and trusting you to always be there and to answer the cries of the heart. I love you. In Jesus' name, amen.

BECOMING THE PERSON GOD WANTS
2 Corinthians 3:18
But we all . . . are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit

When you begin to align your goals with God's goals and your desires with God's desires, you will rid your life of a lot of anger, anxiety and depression. The homemaker who wants a happy, harmonious family is expressing a godly desire, but she cannot guarantee that it will happen. So she'd better not base her identity and sense of worth on it or she will be a basket case of anger or resentment toward her sometimes less-than-harmonious family.

Instead she could decide, &quot;I'm going to be the wife and mother God wants me to be.&quot; That's a great goal! Is it impossible or uncertain? No, because it's also God's goal for her and nothing is impossible with God. Who can block her goal? She's the only one who can. As long as she cooperates with God's goal for her, her success is assured.

&quot;But what if my husband has a mid-life crisis or my kids rebel?&quot; she may object. Problems like that aren't blocking her goal of being the wife and mother God wants her to be, but they will put her goal to a serious test. If her husband ever needs a godly wife, and if her children ever need a godly mother, it's in times of trouble. Family difficulties are merely new opportunities for her to fulfill her goal of being the woman God wants her to be.

The pastor whose worth is based on his goal to win his community for Christ, have the best youth ministry in town, or increase giving to missions by 50 percent is headed for a fall. These are worthwhile desires, but they are poor goals by which to determine his worth because they can be blocked by people or circumstances. Rather he could say, &quot;I'm going to be the pastor God wants me to be.&quot; That's a great goal because nothing can block him from achieving it.

God's basic goal for your life is character development: becoming the person God wants you to be. Because it's a godly goal, no one can block it except you.

Prayer:

Lord, I want to be the person You called me to be today. Thank You that by Your grace I can be that person.

Living Beyond Myself

By Micca Campbell

&quot;The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.&quot; Galatians 5:17(NIV)

Devotion:

I wanted to do the right the right thing, but when push came to shove I reacted according to my flesh instead of the Spirit of God.

My son had become the victim of a school prank. It just wasn't any kind of prank. It was the kind of practical joke that could have ended in tragedy.

Mitch was on his way home from school when he noticed a foul smell. Suddenly, his car was filled with smoke. He pulled over, got out to check the car, and noticed that someone had pulled the rubber bumper down over the exhaust pipe of his car. Concerned about the deadly fumes, Mitch called from his cell phone to be picked up.

While I was furious that someone would play such a trick, I was also thankful that my son knew the danger of the situation and called for help. Had he not, and continued driving, the fumes could have caused him to pass out at the wheel injuring himself and possibly others.

The next day, my husband didn't get the response he had expected while speaking with the school principal. Instead, he got a lesson toward the assumption that &quot;boys will be boys.&quot; Again, I was furious!

Instead of listening to my husband's advice, I decided to talk with the principal myself. I prayed before hand in hopes of conducting myself in a Christ-like manner. It was my hearts desire to do the right thing. Unfortunately, when the principal said, &quot;Hello,&quot; I let him have it! In the midst of my angry outburst, I even blamed the principal for causing me to sin!

Later, I felt so ashamed. I felt convicted over my actions and for not representing the Name I carry...Christian. I could have defended my son and honored God if only I had obeyed the Spirit instead of reacting according to my flesh. I was hurt and confused. &quot;Why do I struggle this way when I truly want to do the right thing?&quot; I pondered within.

I wonder are you also confused to find that struggling with sin is the basic problem of your life. Aren't we supposed to be free from the struggle with sin?

The Bible tells us that even though we are Christians, we will battle our flesh which works to keep us from God. Our key verse describes it this way:

&quot;The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.&quot;

You see, before you and I received new life, we could sin and it wouldn't bother us because the Spirit of God was not living in us convicting us of sin. Once saved, the Sprit of God convicts us of our sinful ways. Therefore, the struggle is on.

We each have old habits and old ways of thinking to break. The Holy Spirit in our hearts breaks the rule of sin in our lives and gives us a new nature and new life by purifying our motives, renewing our minds, and giving us the desire to become like Him. However, it's a life-long process. Our flesh will trip us up sometimes, but allowing Christ's life to flow through us will result in victory over sin.

You and I will continue to struggle while here on earth, but the good news is, one day, when we see Christ face-to-face, the fight will be over. Our flesh will forever be put to death and final victory will be ours!

Dear Lord, I want to live in a way that is pleasing to you but I'm weak and often give in to my fleshly desires. It's only by your Spirit that I can live free from sin. Forgive me, Lord, and fill me with your enabling power, in Jesus' Name, Amen.

Lessons From Noah - Best Inspiration from the Net from Dobhran's Inspire!

Lessons From Noah

There is a lot that can be learned from the story of Noah's Ark, regardless of your religion! For example:

a.. Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.

b.. Stay fit. When you're 600 years old, someone might ask you to do something REALLY big.(amen!)

c.. Don't listen to critics -- do what has to be done.

d.. Build on high ground.

e.. For safety's sake, travel in pairs.

f.. Two heads are better than one.

g.. Speed isn't always an advantage. The cheetahs were on board, but so were the snails.

h.. If you can't fight or flee -- float!

i.. Don't forget that we're all in the same boat.

j.. Remember that the ark was built by amateurs and the Titanic was built by professionals.

k.. Remember that the woodpeckers INSIDE are often a bigger threat than the storm outside.

l.. Don't miss the boat.

m.. No matter how bleak it looks, if God (by whatever name) is with you, there's always a rainbow on the other side!

Where's Your Umbrella?

We all have something to learn from this girl.

As a drought continued for what seemed an eternity, a small community of farmers was in a quandary as to what to do. Rain was important to keep their crops healthy and sustain the townspeople's way of life.

As the problem became more acute, a local pastor called a prayer meeting to ask for rain.

Many people arrived. The pastor greeted most of them as they filed in. As he walked to the front of the church to officially begin the meeting he noticed most people were chatting across the aisles and socializing with friends. When he reached the front his thoughts were on quieting the attendees and starting the meeting.

His eyes scanned the crowd as he asked for quiet. He noticed an eleven year-old girl sitting quietly in the front row. Her face was beaming with excitement. Next to her, poised and ready for use, was a bright red umbrella. The little girl's beauty and innocence made the pastor smile as he realized how much faith she possessed. No one else in the congregation had brought an umbrella.

All came to pray for rain, but the little girl had come expecting God to answer.

All New Household Hints PLEASE BE SURE YOU READ THE LAST ONE ABOUT THE CLOTHES DRYER!!!!!!

1. Reheat Pizza:   Heat up leftover pizza in a Nonstick skillet on top of the stove, set heat to med-low and heat till Warm. This keeps the crust crispy. No soggy micro pizza. I saw this on The cooking channel and it really works.

2. Easy Deviled Eggs: Put cooked egg yolks in A zip lock bag. Seal, mash till they are all broken up. Add remainder Of ingredients , reseal , keep mashing it up mixing thoroughly , cut the Tip of the baggy , squeeze mixture into egg. Just throw bag away when Done easy clean up.

3. Expanding Frosting: When you buy a Container of cake frosting from the store, whip it with your mixer for A few minutes. You can double it in size. You get to frost more Cake/cupcakes with the same amount. You also eat less sugar and calories Per serving.

4. Reheating refrigerated bread: To warm Biscuits, pancakes, or muffins that were refrigerated, place them in A microwave with a cup of water. The increased moisture will keep the Food moist and help it reheat faster.

5. Newspaper weeds away: Start putting in Your plants; work the nutrients in your soil. Wet newspapers put layers Around the plants overlapping as you go cover with mulch and forget About weeds. Weeds will get through some gardening plastic they will not Get through wet newspapers.

6. Broken Glass clean up: Use a wet cotton ball or Q-tip to pick up the Small shards of glass you can't see easily.

7. No More Mosquitoes: Place a dryer sheet in Your pocket. It will keep the mosquitoes away.

8. Squirrel Away!: To keep squirrels from Eating your plants sprinkle your plants with cayenne pepper. The cayenne Pepper doesn't hurt the plant and the squirrels won't come near it.

9. Flexible vacuum nozzle: To get something Out of a heat register or under the fridge add an empty paper towel roll Or empty gift wrap roll to your vacuum. It can be bent or flattened to Get in narrow openings.

10. Reducing Static Cling: Pin a small Safety pin to the seam of your slip and you will not have a clingy skirt Or dress. Same thing works with slacks that cling when wearing panty Hose. Place pin in seam of slacks and -- at DA! -- static is gone.

11. Measuring Cups clean up: Before you Pour sticky substances into a measuring cup, fill with hot water. Dump Out the hot water, but don't dry cup. Next, add your ingredient, such as Peanut butter, and watch how easily it comes right out.

12. Hate foggy windshields? Buy a Chalkboard eraser and keep it in the glove box of your car. When the Windows fog, rub with the eraser! Works better than a cloth!

13. Reopening envelope : If you seal an Envelope and then realize you forgot to include something inside, just Place your sealed envelope in the freezer for an hour or two. Viola! It Unseals easily.

14. Hair Conditioner: Use your hair Conditioner to shave your legs. It's a lot cheaper than shaving cream And leaves your legs really smooth. It's also a great way to use up the Conditioner you bought but didn't like when you tried it in your hair..

15. Goodbye Fruit Flies: To get rid of pesky Fruit flies , take a small glass fill it 1/2&quot; with Apple Cider Vinegar And 2 drops of dish washing liquid  mix well. You will find those flies Drawn to the cup and gone forever!

16. Get Rid of Ants: Put small piles of Cornmeal where you see ants. They eat it, take it &quot;home&quot;, can't digest It so it kills them. It may take a week or so, especially if it rains , But it works &amp; you don't have the worry about pets or small children Being harmed!

17. INFO ABOUT CLOTHES DRYERS: The heating Unit went out on my dryer! The gentleman that fixes things around the House for us told us that he wanted to show us something and he went Over to the dryer and pulled out the lint filter. It was clean.
(I always clean the lint from the filter after every load clothes) He told us that he wanted to show us something; he Took the filter over to the sink, ran hot water over it. The lint filter Is made of a mesh material - I'm sure you know what your dryer's lint Filter looks like. WELL...the hot water just sat on top of the mesh! It Didn't go through it at all! He told us that dryer sheets cause a film Over that mesh that's what burns out the heating unit. You can't SEE the Film , but its there. It's what is in the dryer sheets to make your clothes soft and static free - that nice fragrance too; you know how they can feel waxy when you take them out of the box, and well this stuff builds up on your clothes and on your lint screen. This is also what causes dryer units to catch fire &amp; potentially burn your house down with it! He said the best way to keep your dryer working for a very long time
(&amp; to keep your electric bill lower) is to take that filter out &amp; wash it with hot soapy water &amp; an old toothbrush (or other brush) at least every six months. He said that makes the life of the dryer at least twice as long! How about that!?!  Learn something new everyday! I certainly didn't know dryer sheets would do that. So, I thought I'd share! Note:  I went to my dryer &amp; tested my screen by running water on it. The water ran through a little bit but mostly collected all the water in the mesh screen. I washed it with warm soapy water &amp; a nylon brush &amp; I had it done in 30 seconds. Then when I rinsed it the water ran right Thru the screen! There wasn't any puddling at all! That repairman knew what he was talking about!

PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK. NOT ONLY COULD IT SAVE SOMEONE'S HOME ,

BUT IT COULD SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE
