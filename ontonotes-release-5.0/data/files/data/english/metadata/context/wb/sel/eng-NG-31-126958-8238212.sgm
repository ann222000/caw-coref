&quot;Rangers score 30 in twin-bill opener: Offensive output is most runs scored
in 110 years&quot;

By T.R. Sullivan / MLB.com

BALTIMORE -- The Rangers smashed their way into the Major League record
books on Wednesday night with the most runs scored in 110 years.

Marlon Byrd and Travis Metcalf both hit grand slams, and Jarrod
Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez hit two home runs each as the Rangers
walloped the Baltimore Orioles, 30-3, in Game 1 of a doubleheader at Camden
Yards.

The 30 runs were the most in the Major Leagues since 1900. The Boston Red
Sox scored 29 runs in a game in 1950 and the Chicago White Sox matched that
in 1955. Chicago of the National League scored 36 runs in a game in 1897.

The Rangers entered the game hitting .190 with 10 runs scored in their
previous five games but ended up setting a new club record with 29 hits. The
previous record for most runs came in a 26-7 victory over the Orioles on
April 19, 1996.

Byrd and Metcalf, who was just called up from Triple-A Oklahoma, became only
the second pair of Rangers to hit grand slams in the same game. The other
was July 4, 2004, when Hank Blalock and Mark Teixeira went deep with the
bases loaded.

Rangers left-hander Kason Gabbard picked up his second victory for the
Rangers despite trailing, 3-0, after three innings. He ended up going six,
allowing seven hits and a walk and striking out three. He is now 6-1 with a
3.65 ERA overall with both the Rangers and the Boston Red Sox.

Saltalamacchia had seven RBIs, including a two-run single to get the Rangers
started in the top of the fourth. Vazquez followed with a three-run home run
that gave the Rangers a 5-3 lead against Orioles starter Daniel Cabrera.

Saltalamacchia then hit a home run to lead off the sixth, the first of 10
hits the Rangers had that inning. That tied a club record set on May 17,
2001, against the Cleveland Indians.

Reliever Brian Burres replaced Cabrera and the Rangers loaded the bases on a
single by Vazquez, a walk to Frank Catalanotto and a single by Michael
Young. Byrd then crushed one high and deep into the left-field seats for a
grand slam, the third of his career.

That gave the Rangers a 10-3 lead, but they didn't stop there. Burres struck
out Jason Botts, but the Rangers followed with six straight singles to bring
home four runs. The Rangers finished with nine runs that inning but did even
better later in the game.

Metcalf entered the game defensively for Young and hit a grand slam in the
eighth inning off Rob Bell. Saltalamacchia added a three-run home run in a
10-run inning.

The Rangers scored six more in the ninth with the help of a two-run double
by Botts and a three-run home run by Vazquez.
