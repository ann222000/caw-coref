Very interesting all the comments about FM operation. Some serious, some not. Both are interesting reading. I remember back at least 35 years ago the big discussion about two meter FM operation with the rather large Motorola and other radios that took up a lot of room both in the shacks and in vehicles. The SSB/CW crowd and even the AM'ers (yes there was plenty of AM operation in the late '60's and early 70's) were really upset. I operated all four modes at that time. And yes, FM is a mode! I really never appreciated FM operation during contests and usually avoided it. However, a few contacts were made on .52 and it turned out to be a great way to introduce those that operated FM only on VHF to other modes, now called weak signal. How many of the FM'ers (mostly HF'ers) became interested in SSB/CW modes is unknown, but I know there were some. My thinking is that if we gain just a few to "our" side of the spectrum the effort is worth it. After all, most of us started on HF and somehow became introduced to VHF/UHF. So if the same thing occurs due to our FM operation, thats a good thing. Remember that FM is often used by weak-signal types to assist lining up paths for the really high freqs such as 10 gHz and higher, and works well. 927.5 FM is an excellent way for many of us to get started on that band and be able to play with propagation up there, and eventually move down to 903 when finances (in most cases) allow. Also it is an excellent freq to use to talk to locals on a quiet frequency unlike two meter FM. I currently run 30 watts out with a Motorola 128 channel rig and a M2 yagi at 35 feet. It works very well, and hopefully some contacts will be able to be made with mountain toppers eventually. Someone said on a previous posting that a mode is a mode and a QSO is a QSO, and at this point in time all modes of operation count for a contact. Until the rules are changed, lets live with it and make the most of the opportunities available. Any QSO on 50 mHz and up on any mode that is available, is better than none at all! So ssb/cw/fm/am/wsjt/laser, whatever - fantastic!
Thanks for reading this novel!

And a fine novel it was :-).

As for me, that last sentence makes sense.  Who cares what mode we use,
the object is to *communicate*.

That said, in my particular situation I could be a lot more active if I
could swallow FM on repeaters, I can't, so I struggle with what
resources I have to acquire the SSB/CW stuff I have.  There is simply
no way I can afford a DEMI (or any other) transverter and not likely to
for some time to come, if ever.  I could afford one of the FM rigs for
900 once my pennies stack up high enough to cover that and a power
supply:).

If VHF/UHF/etc. weak signal stuff is for the ssb/cw only folks who are
fortunate enough to be able to afford the equipment, then I am just
left out if and until I can.  Seems to me that having activity that
might eventually go to ssb/cw when opportunity permits is better than
no activity and discouragement.

Dunno, I just don't see the "only" clause when the ability to
communicate is what it is all about.  I do NOT include repeaters in
that acceptance, they might fail less than cell in actual emergencies,
but they can and do fail.  Weak signal has a point to it and that is to
know how well one can communicate when the chips are down!

This is not fantastic,

It is sad that this PNWVHFS has resorted to a prehistoric, band hogging
scheme as FM just to qualify points in a contest. Really people, many of
you have had conflicts with myself on this very matter. I have had to
refrain from FM's inherent nature capture effect to avoid being another
CB'er. I simply cannot see this as a good mode to promote weak signal
work..

I must say also, that I have spent several 4 figures at Rick's (nu7z)
house purchasing what I thought was high quality weak signal toys...and
to see this selling of FM for profit is really very distasteful from my
point of view.

We are in the most difficult weak signal geography on the planet and we
are dx'ing on FM?

I expected a whole bunch more when I joined this group.

I am sure to be flamed or ignored. Fact is this is embarrassing.

Shame shame, w7eme

I think your taking it too hard and the whole thing too seriously.  We need
to be more inclusive as a group. However we seemed focused on the
traditional weak signal work.  But we shouldn't shun the fm stuff. If
someone spent a few extra bucks for an fm rig on 222 or 900 then so be it.
Thier goal was to increase thier score and therefore activity.  FM is
limited as compare to ssb or digital or cw. Therefore the same urge that
made them spend 100 bucks on a fm rig might make them spend 300 on an
xverter.  I first roved with an alinco 222 fm radio, I then sold it on e-bay
and upgraded to a 222 module in a 736.  A 100 dollar upgrade at the time.

To be snobish about fm will only segrigate our nich more. We need to
demostrate how we beat fm in performance. This is done when an fmer sees us
talking beyond repeater ranges without a repeater.  I know this because it
is how I got here and I am realitively new to this nich.
Beyond this there is greater evidence in the portland area with less
population than the sound but a very active group on 144.240 all talking,
rag chewing and encouraging growth in non fm modes in the valley.  This has
shown up in my logs in the past with more stations worked in the cn 85 area
than the cn 87 area.

When I was more active on that 144.240 group I seen several people switch to
horizontal antennas as thier interest grew., The monday night net has always
strived to work verticle and horizontal.  The net is less formal than ours
and more rag chew like.  I suppose we cant always be exchanging grid squares
and signal reports.

I dont know why it took off in the pdx area, was it the friendly nature of
the net, the flier at HRO or what?

I for one welcome the fmers, there are alot who are in our membership here.
I encourage them to grow  or expand at thier own pace.  When we get the off
core subject like sats  or other things, those in the know in these topics
should speak up and help them.

I havent read the bi-laws but I dont see the ownership of a ssb radio to be
a pre-requisit.  Jeremy and Paul are 2 of the more technical people on here
and we should encourage people to grow that way but we should not isolate
them as beginers with fm rigs. However we should be clear to point out that
fm in weak signal work is a beginers place. However the top scores in roving
in the northwest and perhaps the country were done with alot of fm gear.
Ponder that. When I did I quit contesting for a year.

We all have to make this enjoyable for ourselves and I encourage all of us
to be inclusive as long as they keep the fm in the fm area.   I must admit I
dont monitor fm freqs in the contest and I should. I do switch over and move
up when asked. I dont refuse just to punish someone for not having ssb or
cw. Again they will see thier limits and will work to overcome them.

The point we need to worry is when a fm only contest station buys a kw amp
as the first improvement to thier station as compared to a ssb rig or a
horizontal antenna.  When that happens my point would be lost.

Its a good discussion and has implications of our future here.

Frank,

Nobody is isolating beginners from FM rigs.

I won't attempt to speak for anyone but myself. Those
who agree with me know who they are, whether they
spoke out publicly or not.

One of the main things that brings us together in the
PNWVHFS is the genuine interest in promoting WEAK
SIGNAL activity. Those who are not solid on what weak
signal means for VHF and above frequencies, should
look on the ARRL Web Site. Things like EME, meteor
scatter and establishing DX records are mentioned.
Buying a cheap FM radio to get a few more points in
contests is not mentioned. Just because a whole lot of
these 927.5 MHz frequency hogging boxes have become
easy to get, doesn't make it a good thing for a group
whose interests have weak signal work at the
forefront.

Those who worked KI7JA in DN27 and W7ZSL in DN03
recently, know and appreciate the meaning of weak
signal. If you worked either of these guys, you worked
your way to the point of being able to make the Q.
Operating ability, equipment, antennas...whatever it
took. Not everybody cut it to work Bruce on 6-meters,
but some did. These guys are into weak signal work.
The guys who tried, but didn't make it are too; they
just have to put more work into it.

There are many other serious weak signal enthusiasts
in our group. W7PUA, W7LHL and KD7TS come to mind with
their excellent work on the microwave bands.

I'd venture to say that most if not all members of the
Society are really weak signal folks at heart. So,
let's recognize that the proliferation of cheapo FM
radios is not in our best interest. That's what my
original post was about. (Clay: Get back to those
taxes.)

there are alot of members on the list I have yet to hear on ssb.  My 2 metr
sation can work cm 97 on a good day.

Its funny how we are both at some what the same point and same belief that
ssb is better but we have been down different roads to get there.  I dont
think we should limit ourselves.  Check your logs and compare it to the list
of members.  I would consider this it the top of a mountain that has many
different angles and paths to the top.  Many of the hams out there dont even
know the mountain exists.

I don't appreciate any ham telling another ham how he should or shouldn't
enjoy his hobby.  It's a big hobby with lots of ways to pursue it.  FM, AM,
SSB, CW, digital or TV -- who cares?  It's not like the VHF/UHF bands are
particularly crowded.  Let's take all the activity we can get before we lose
more spectrum to commercial interests.  If someone enjoys FM, then let them
enjoy it.  In no way does it decrease my enjoyment of SSB &amp; CW.  If we ever
want to see our numbers grow, then we should try to foster a sense of
community by encouraging and assisting our fellow hams, rather than
criticizing them because they don't do things exactly the way we think they
should.  I've actually been criticized for running a kilowatt on 6M.  I
guess it doesn't qualify as weak signal unless you are actually putting out
a weak signal.  Fortunately, that was an exception and most of you have been
very encouraging to me (as one of the new kids on the block).

BTW, I would like to voice my strong disapproval of email as a communication
mode for serious members of PNWVHFS.  It's definitely a notch below CB.  At
least that involves radio.  Let's have these discussions of 144.200, .220 or
.240.  But, I don't want to step on anyone's enjoyment of the hobby.  So if
email is a mode that you particularly like, then ignore what I just said and
enjoy!

Hi All,
I'm relatively new to VHF weak signals and I'm still struggling to get
antennas going and so on. I've talked to a few members on 2M and I enjoyed
the learning that I got from them.

While new to VHF non-FM I have been a ham for over 30 years. This isn't to
say that I know anything; merely this is a new avenue of exploration in a
hobby that I am well established in.

When I reviewed the posts about FM and weak signal work I was a little
dismayed by the tone of some of the postings. I am not going to single
anybody out on this. There will always be people that become fanatics about
a particular mode or way of operating and I respect and hold these people in
awe. I particularly enjoy working the Satellites right now and a secondary
benefit of this is a modest but usable VHF/UHF station. My biggest
constraint now is antennas (working on it).

Not everyone who is going to invest in VHF/UHF operations is going to plunk
down big bucks for pre-amps, high-power, and so on. However, we can educate,
Elmer, and share our journey with people like myself that are relatively new
to a mode such as weak signal VHF.

Let's keep in mind that this is a hobby and people come from all over the
place to enjoy it. To make statements that discourage, shun, or belittle
anybody else is not consistent with the goals of Ham Radio and the
fellowship that we are a part of. We want to attract people to this hobby
not subject them to curmudgary (this is not a real word but one I created
especially for this post - derivate word curmudgeon).

Please consider this when you make comments about CBer's on FM, beginners
modes, and other similar remarks that might seem to disparage somebody else
exploring this avenue.

I just sent my check in to join the PNW VHF Society and I look forward to
the opportunity to get to know some of you in more detail.

Thanks for reading my burning ember,

Very well put Clay.  My hats off to you.. Its not hidden fact we all love our hobby... Some just  do things diffrent than others.. I keep telling eveyone one I come incontact with the best thing I ever did was join this PNWVHFS group... Everyone has there thoughts on FM. So be it.. As I stated on my other post I spend next to zero time on repeaters anymore (Unless I am on when the wife &amp; daughter are driving out of town later at night or just to keep in touch) But I LOVE SSB.. You all have me hooked.. But I still have a small place in my heart for repeaters.. I have made tons of great friends threw my raidos either ssb or fm. Till I get my tower up I I will drive anywhere I have to with my uitilty trailer with my 11 element 2M yagi (Big thanks to Bruce KI7JA) in just to hope to get one contact on the net tuesday night...  Its a Big thrill to me... But like Clay stated it a hobby let make it as fun as we can and use as much as we can before we lose it..  NO MATTER WHAT
MODE...
My next adventure will be in to some digital mods for 2M &amp; 6M.

Time for a group hug.

Dan/KD7UFF

P.S. I will be posting some pics my  small trailer with my 11 ele, yagi that I used last tuesday night and will be using untill my tower gets up... Then you will see how much I want to to make just one contact.
Just don't email me back laughing at me..

Clay,

I agree that each ham should enjoy his hobby as he
wishes. It is, indeed, a big hobby. A hobby that
includes specialized areas. The way we enjoy our hobby
differs from area to area and by how we choose to
appreciate and enhance what's important with respect
to each area.

Growing our numbers is not an aspect considered part
of  the weak signal interest, important as it may be.
FM is also not considered part of the weak signal
interest.

I realize that many will choose to ignore how I feel
about this FM radio thing. That's fine. Nobody will
become my adversary. I agree with what you say about
criticism. I'm not sure I'd agree that someone who
deserves criticism shouldn't get it, though.

I think email is fine.

If people criticize you for running a kW, just tell
them the truth: that you're running barefoot.

73,
Paul, K7CW

Right on Mike! If it wasn't for CB we world not have enough hams on the air to make the hobby interesting, it would have died a decade or two ago.

I am a former FM'er. I used FM when it was relatively new in the mid 60's at college where our station had a big 52.525 Motorola base station. Guess what we worked most of the time? DX all over the country.

In the early 70's I operated long-haul FM mobile using repeaters 40-60 miles from my QTH.

I operated on the first 220 repeater in the Chicago area for over a decade and
I led my local radio club to install its first repeaters for 2M and 1 1/4 M in the late 70's.

FM was fun in the beginning and weak signal work was a part of it as well as getting more people interested in the hobby. Now I only use FM to keep in touch with my friends and make conacts on 927.5 and 223.5 in contests.

I too prefer CW/SSB and will gladly buy a 902 transverter from amyone with deep pockets who will sell it to me for $90!

Any volunteers?

Greg

I'd spend a lot more time on VHF/UHF if there was anyone to work.  When I
first got started with weak signal a couple of years ago, I almost gave up
for lack of activity.  It didn't seem worth the investment of time and money
to build a suitable station.  Unless there is a contest or the weak signal
net is on, 99% of my calls go unanswered.  It shouldn't take a contest to
get weak signal enthusiasts on the air.  I also work weak signal on 160M and
80M and there is no lack of people to work there if the band is just
marginally open.  A few more hams interested in our small aspect of the
hobby would be nice.  I've been told that the weak signal activity today is
small compared to years past.

&gt; 80M and there is no lack of people to work there if the band is just
&gt; marginally open.  A few more hams interested in our small aspect of the
&gt; hobby would be nice.  I've been told that the weak signal activity today is
&gt; small compared to years past.

This conversation is starting to get closer to one of the problems I see with
the VHF/UHF weak signal scene.  While some might think I am into instant
gratification and can't handle sitting in front of the radio waiting for
the next sporadic E opening to Arizona on 222 MHz, I do tend to operate on
the more masochistic bands.  Most of my non contest activity takes place on
160 meters.  I even worked K7CW there a week or two ago.

Here are recordings of two stations I worked during just the past two
evenings:

http://www.kkn.net/~tree/ua3tcj.wav
http://www.kkn.net/~tree/ra4lw2.wav

These are received with a new beverage antenna I spent all weekend working
on.  Radio doesn't get any better than that.

I'll forgive Clay for operating on 80 meters, but that is really a sissy
band where anyone can work Europe.  :-)  But I say that after putting up
a 4 square.

For me, without the sporadic-E openings on six meters, VHF/UHF is pretty
Boring.  EME perhaps would change that dynamic, and I am working on it.
I hope to work Lew, W7EW, on WSJT from ZL8 on six meters this weekend.  I
am not sure WSJT is for me - but I will give it a try before I decide.

I will have 80 elements on 2 meters pointing at the moon perhaps next year
as I came home from Oklahoma with the W7FG EME array on top of my wife's
mini-van:

http://www.kkn.net/~tree/w7fg.jpg

Still looking for a good deal on an 8877 2 meter amp if anyone ever finds
one in their garage they want to get rid of.

So - except for the above - you will typically only hear me on during the
time six meters has the potential of doing something interesting.  Working
a VK6, late at night, who is running 10 watts is VERY COOL.  And that opening
I enjoyed to Europe during the June VHF contest a few years ago will be
one of my all time highlights.  Running JAs like the good old days during
F2 openings - still a kick.

And - when is someone in Oregon going to beat me in the June VHF contest???
Other than N7AU, I don't think anyone in Washington/Oregon has been able
to keep up with me in June.  Conside the gauntlet thrown - six years is
long enough.  My ego can take it.  :-)  I don't live on a mountain top
and I am lucky to work any rovers at all.

There - that should stir things up a little...

When it comes to 160 &amp; 80M, I'm still in puberty.  I only have 27 countries
on 160 (last winter) and about 105 on 80.  I'm currently taking steroids and
testosterone supplements and have high hopes of growing up to be a real ham.
I'm glad to have a role model like you Tree ;)  I don't have room for
beverages, but have plans on the drawing board for a rotatable 160M receive
antenna.  The models indicate performance comparable to a 750-1000' beverage
on 160M.

I don't have WSJT installed, so I won't be able to work Lew on 6M, but I
expect to work the ZL8 crew on 160 &amp; 80.  I listened this morning for them
but I don't think they went below 40M.  I was able to work them on 40 and 30
(not much of an accomplishment).

My more immediate goal is 2 elements on 80 meters.  Hopefully next spring.
After that, EME on 2M.  I already have the big M2 elevation rotor.  I may
eventually play with WSJT, but won't be happy until I can hear my own echos
reliably.

I'll claim puberty when it comes to contests as well.  I was in the June
VHF, September VHF and the Salmon Run.  I'm pretty happy with my showing
considering I'm new to VHF and contests.  Steroids, no-doze and
bigger/higher antennas for next year's contests should help.  Maybe in a
couple of years I'll be up to the challenge.  Of course, at 180' ASL I don't
live on a mountain top either.

You sure put in a solid effort last June - and with the right openings, you
will clean my clock.

I'll QRX when I hear you calling the ZL8 on 160.  :-)

Tree, what's the length of your beverage antenna? I see the DX Engineering web page (where they sell their beverage matching transformers, etc.) says that the "best" length is 720 feet long for 160 Meters (and that 720' length is shown as being "good" on 80 and 40-Meters, as well.)  I could fit one of those in on my property, if it's towards Europe.

UA3TCJ has a full-size 2-element 80-Meter Quad, and a full-size 4-element 40-Meter Quad. No wonder I can work him on both 80 and 40 Meters with my little Inverted vee up 30' high!  His web page has some great pictures of those big quads. I haven't checked his web page lately to see what he's running for a 160M antenna.
