Actually, Final 3 was original supposed to be the 3-D one, what with the
roller coaster, and all--
But, say the producers, oh sure, we all like 3-D NOW, don't we?...Oh
yeah, nobody has *any* problem greenlighting them with cheap-bastard New
Line execs nowadays!  9_9

Note that, fwiw, FRIDAY 13TH 3-D was an above-average entry...
although that was largely because its murders reprised the pilot's.
Meanwhile, though, afaik, this new FINAL would be the first live-
action for the young and ubiquitous Real-3D system ...and, I suspect,
a bit of a technical watershed.

The Final Destination franchise has become what the Freddy Kreuger
franchise was in the eighties--the thinking person's horror series
(which isn't saying much, just that as the Kreuger movies were
marginally smarter than the Halloween/F13 knockoffs, the FD series has
had more on the ball than Saw 1-4 or whatever else torture porn thing
is going on).  So a franchise that hasn't trashed its own rep, coupled
with 3D, if I had money to invest, I'd be looking at Final Destination
4.

Beowulf in 3-D is more like patched Computer Graphic in  Xbox game.
There is
no human action. Only walking and talking are human action. Anything
else
like fighting scene is all Computer graphic. .

Elm Street at least tried to top itself on over-the-top fantasy-SFX
scenes and &quot;punny&quot; death-wisecracks, and after 3, at least some measure
of the kids trying to fight back--

While Final 1 was, literally, a rewritten X-Files episode that Fox
turned down as too violent--Which explains why those two FBI agents were
wandering around the first story.
Unfortunately, they'd lost their reason for &quot;Neat-o Rube Goldberg death
scenes&quot; by the end of the second movie, and, well...did someone say
&quot;Torture porn&quot;?

You misremember on that last point.  At the time, one of the enjoyably
novel (or, at any rate, novel-seeming) aspects of the very first ELM
ST. was its climactic duel between Freddy and a sweet young thing who
was actually kick-ass resourceful and never once twisted her ankle...

Wes dragged the original down with his own &quot;tongue&quot; and &quot;obscene
phone-call&quot; fetish-kinks--
He spent all of &quot;New Nightmare&quot;'s script stamping his feet and whining
about how New Line made it &quot;funny&quot; and ran away with the franchise
without him, but cry us a river, Wes, New Line thought it would've died
with the third movie if you'd stayed on.

Seriously, even if at the time you thought ANOES was the bomb, how can
you even give it a passing mention at this point in time.  You bemoan
horror films lacking an R rating, and then you sing the praises of the
patron saint of horror films utterly lacking any intensity.  I think it
can be safely said that Craven single handedly reinvented the American
horror movie as teeny bopper matinee fare.  And they're still doing it
today, albeit with more CGI created gore.  &quot;Thank you, Wes Craven, for
creating a world where both Wrong Turn movies could be made!&quot;  It would
be nice if there was some common ground here, but I keep doing the math
and I keep coming up with &quot;Craven's movies are shit.&quot;

Maybe so.  But even kinky fetishes worked in the first one, imo... not
so much as terror -- Trotsky's right -- but at least as
entertainment.  Nice to have a teen-predator with a salacious side.
(That could've been a legitimate point of disagreement in FREDDY VS.
JASON... as I can't recall that Freddy ever offed anyone for
fornicating...)

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right.  I forgot to add that, dragged down by the leaden torpor

&gt;&gt; Wes dragged the original down with his own &quot;tongue&quot; and &quot;obscene
&gt;&gt; phone-call&quot; fetish-kinks--
&gt;&gt; He spent all of &quot;New Nightmare&quot;'s script stamping his feet and whining
&gt;&gt; about how New Line made it &quot;funny&quot; and ran away with the franchise
&gt;&gt; without him, but cry us a river, Wes, New Line thought it would've died
&gt;&gt; with the third movie if you'd stayed on.

&gt; Maybe so.  But even kinky fetishes worked in the first one, imo... not
&gt; so much as terror -- Trotsky's right -- but at least as
&gt; entertainment.  Nice to have a teen-predator with a salacious side.
&gt; (That could've been a legitimate point of disagreement in FREDDY VS.
&gt; JASON... as I can't recall that Freddy ever offed anyone for
&gt; fornicating...)

Yes, Freddy's so salacious he makes &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; look like a
G rated movie.  Did Calvin give you some of his bathtub gin, or what?

Say what you want about &quot;Halloween&quot;, John Carpenter claimed he was just
following producer's orders to make a movie about babysitters in jeopardy.
Carpenter just happened to make it good/mainstream/popular enough to get
standard TBMF out of the drive-ins and into the indoor theaters.

That's the problem with slagging Wes Craven.  We're all well outside
the demo of most of his movies.  He's a solid filmmaker who's had more
longevity than most directors who came up in the seventies.  He didn't
have to slum his talents in Masters of Horror (even if nothing Craven
has done lately reached the level of Joe Dante's MoH's
contributions).  He hasn't declined as horrifically as John
Carpenter.

Dunno why he's doing Shocker again--it sounds even less promising than
a De Palma Untouchables prequel--but I didn't know he helped with
Paris je t'aime, along with about 90,000 other people, till I looked
him up on the IMDB just now.

Are you insane?  This has to be a ruse.  &quot;Slumming his talents&quot; in
Masters of Horror?  Did you see &quot;Cigarette Burns&quot;?--I've watched it
twice and I would go so far as to say it's fantastic.  But Craven, the
McDonald's of horror, has been around a long time and shouldn't be
&quot;slagged&quot;--I will think of this more in depth the next time I'm hurling
projectile vomit while enjoying a McRib sandwich.  I'll give you credit:

&gt; i always really liked shocker for some reason.

You obviously found charms I didn't... and it's rated pretty low at
IMDb.  However, those &quot;charms&quot; you found may have been prescient; the
new version's apparently not a sequel like I said, but rather is a
remake... and, while the original's listed as Horror, the new one is
Comedy...

Didn't see it.  But imdb has a 6.0 for &quot;Pro-Life&quot; and a 7.8 rating for
&quot;Cigarette Burns&quot;, so I continue to wonder what the motherfuck you are
talking about.  It just doesn't make a whole lotta sense: you seem to be
be smart enough to watch horror from all around the world, but then you
serve up this castigation for &quot;slagging Craven&quot;.  At the risk of being
repetitive, my personal feeling is that Craven must have missed his true
calling in life--cleaning toilets--because making horror films sure
isn't it.  I don't even think his movies can even be called &quot;horror&quot;
because any elements of horror in them are so weak.  &quot;Bubblegum horror&quot;,
maybe.  I mean, he has proven there is a market for movies like his,
utterly lacking in intensity, but for anybody with even a smattering of
knowledge about the genre to defend this loser I find really weird.

It's the curse of the unquestioning cult audience.  They're there for
the artist.  They love the work but they're so uncritical and the bar
is set so low that the filmmaker or whatever becomes a victim of his
own audience's easy-to-please easy-to-meet expectations.  It's a
distressing mix of French auterism and Aint it Cool hero worship.  I
don't know how else to explain Trotsty's man crush on Carpenter
coupled with his hatred for Wes Craven.   By any rational standard,
Craven ain't that bad as a commercial filmmaker in the Hollywood
system and John Carpenter's fallen a hell of a long way from Halloween
and Assault on Precinct 13.

You need a point of reference, mp.  You've shown a like for some of
Craven's movies, and displeasure for CB, which kind of makes you look
like you've been taking a nip of Calvin's bathtub gin again.
Everybody's entitled to their tastes, but if a wine conoisseur tells you
about the latest and greatest from France, and you say, &quot;No, I'll stick
with Boone's Farm, thank,&quot; it doesn't exactly bode well for you.

&gt; own audience's easy-to-please easy-to-meet expectations.  It's a
&gt; distressing mix of French auterism and Aint it Cool hero worship.  I
&gt; don't know how else to explain Trotsty's man crush on Carpenter
&gt; coupled with his hatred for Wes Craven.   By any rational standard,
&gt; Craven ain't that bad as a commercial filmmaker in the Hollywood
&gt; system and John Carpenter's fallen a hell of a long way from Halloween
&gt; and Assault on Precinct 13.

Un-fucking-believable.  Carpenter made &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; those
two movies alone put him so far head and shoulders above Craven that
Craven could make 800 movies and still never come close.  And where did
I say I was some kind of fanboy of Carpenter's?  That was an idiotic
thing to infer.  I like Carpenter when he makes good movies: the two
already mentioned, EFNY, BTILC, and I even thought &quot;Vampires&quot; was pretty
damn entertaining.  AOP13 was also quite good, so kudos, you managed to
mention that.  The Craven movies that aren't pieces of shit seem to be
sorely lacking from your post, though.

Say, is all this some sort of elaborate defense of your affinity to rub
elbows with teenage audiences at the latest Craven magnum opus?  If so
you might have more in common with &quot;RichA&quot; than you might think.

Not really. It's demographics. The studios think the audience for horror is
the 14 to 24 age group. They also think they spend the most money and have
severe attention defecit disorder

Okay, I won't blame the teeny-boppers if you convince me the studios
are wrong... (and I'll be grateful, besides...)

Why wouldn't you want to see *all* of the series?

Can't say I'm a massive Miike fan but when you sit down in front of
one of his films you know you're not going to be bored.  Not sure
what's wrong with searching them out.

Actually, they're probably not wrong. The kids are the main audience for
the theatre. The studios haven't caught up with DVD sales yet, for which we
older folks, disgusted by paying high prices just to see one movie, get the
films on DVD rather than go to theatre.
