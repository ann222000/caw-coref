Today I bought a brand new iPhone from the O2 store in Oxford. I
picked up my new iPhone, and took it home.

That's when things started to go wrong.

1. When I took the receipt out the bag, I noticed that they had added
iPhone insurance to my account. In the store I had specifically said
that I didn't want the insurance, and they said that was fine - but
apparently added it anyway. I didn't initially notice because it
doesn't cost anything until you activate your iPhone. But it doesn't
say anywhere how much this insurance costs, not on the receipt, or the
website. Very poor.

2. I unbox my new iPhone and connect it to my Mac, and start the
activation process with iTunes. I'm porting my number from T-Mobile
and have a PAC code to enable me to do that. But the porting system is
apparently broken, when I enter my code it says that I'm already an O2
customer. I'm not. O2 customer services acknowledge that it's broken
and say to try again later, but it doesn't work later, either.
Eventually I have to instead get provided with a new number, and then
port later via customer services. Poor.

3. My iPhone is defective. The screen backlight isn't working on the
left hand side, and it flickers nastily at random intervals.

I'm extremely disappointed. I might expect such poor service from a
mobile phone company from O2 but I expect more from Apple. My opinion
of them has taken a nosedive.

According to CW it costs £40 per quarter. I declined.

Others experiences seem to have been better. Hopefully they'll restore
your confidence by handling your return well.

I was offered that too from CPW, like Ian I declined it. (Although I was
quoted £35!)

I had that too and called through - about 30 seconds on hold, and then
through to a 'real person' who gave me that message - apparantly their
number porting IT system has gone down!

They gave me some spiel about it costing £900 or something to replace
the iPhone if I lost it. I wasn't really listening to be honest as I
didn't want the insurance. It was going to be added if I hadn't queried
if it was included in the price.

I did buy a Griffin Elan Form hard shell leather case from them though.
Strangely this product doesn't appear on the Griffin Web page or show
up when I google it. Very nice case.

iPod touch version here:

I am cased up. I assumed if you wrecked or lost your phone it was a
matter of buying another iphone and having it activated for your
account ? am I wrong ?

No, that's right. At least in America, you can 'restore' a new phone to
the state of the old one you lost just by plugging it in. Someone at
Engadget had to do it when their first iPhone got damaged (or was DOA, I
can't remember which).

So it's utter FUD.
