War Crimes Report Shows US Violations of International Law

Demands Prosecution of US Military and Civilian Leaders

The violence of the Iraq War, the chaos that has come to Iraq, can be
traced directly to the illegality of the invasion and occupation of
that country and the illegality of the tactics and weapons being used
to maintain the occupation. U.S. War Crimes in Iraq and Mechanisms
for Accountability documents these violations and calls on us all to
demand investigation and prosecution of violations of international
law by military and civilian leaders.

The report was prepared by Consumers for Peace.org with the advice of
Karen Parker, noted lawyer in human rights and humanitarian law. Ms.
Parker is President of the San-Francisco-based Association of
Humanitarian Lawyers ( www.humanlaw.org ) and Chief Delegate to the
United Nations for the Los Angeles-based International Educational
Development/Humanitarian Law Project (IED/AHL), an accredited
non-governmental organization on the U.N. Secretary-General?s list.

Dahr Jamail, noted independent journalist who spent more than eight
months reporting from occupied Iraq, writes the following about the report:

I cannot endorse strongly enough this report prepared by Karen Parker
regarding U.S. war crimes in Iraq. Having witnessed much of what is
so well documented in this report, it is a clear and encompassing
indictment of the Bush Administration for the war crimes they are
directly responsible for in Iraq. Until evidence such as this begins
to see the light of day in a court of law and the perpetrators
brought to justice, the world remains unsafe and unstable from an
administration determined to rule the world. After witnessing what
they are capable of in Iraq, I have no doubt these people will not
stop in their quest for world domination.? Instead, they must be
stopped. And the only way to do that is bring the guilty to justice.
This document will help achieve that goal.

Kathy Kelly, co-coordinator of Voices for Creative Non-Violence,
three-time nominee for the Noble Peace Prize, who has visited Iraq 28
times in the last 15 years, writes of the report:

After spending four days in the fortified and secure Green Zone, in
Iraq, during September 06, former Secretary of State James Baker III
assured that the investigative panel he led had not spent any time
wringing our hands over what mistakes might or might not have been
created in the past. (NYT, September 20, 2006). The Consumers for
Peace report on war crimes committed in Iraq helps us understand our
responsibility not to wring our hands but rather to demand
accountability from elected representatives by delivering this report
to them and to local media. How many people killed? How many families
torn apart? How many homes destroyed? How many livelihoods gone? How
many lives ruined? How many cities sacrificed? We bear responsibility
to end the war in Iraq, insist on just reparations for suffering
caused, and promote careful, legal scrutiny of the crimes committed.
This report beckons all who read it to stop collaborating with
illegal, immoral warmongers who recklessly afflict Iraq.

Neil MacKay, multi-award winning Home Affairs and Investigations
Editor of the Sunday Herald (Scotland), writes:

"What has happened in Iraq is a great sin and a great crime. The
invasion and occupation have stained the concepts of democracy,
freedom and liberty; and disgraced the good name of the people of
both the United States of America and Great Britain. As a journalist
who has investigated the roots of this war, and the on-going horror
of what is happening in Iraq, I fully commend this report to readers.
It is an important reminder of the blood which is on the hands of our
leaders, and the shame that the governments of the UK and the USA
have brought to the British and American people by perpetrating a
criminal war in our name."
