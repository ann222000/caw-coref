my tank is a 30 gallon 36 inch wide by 16.5 tall by 12.5 deep.  it
came with a hood that has a light casing rated at 20 watts, and the
bulb (only one bulb) is something like 28 inches wide.

the light gives enough light to see in the tank, but it seems a bit
inadequate.  the corners of the tank are dark (there are four inches
of no bulb on either side of the tank), and i've got a bunch of live
plants in there.  most of the plants seem to be doing ok (they've been
in there for a week), but i'm sort of stuck putting them nearer the
middle of the tank.

any suggestions on lighting?  i don't want to add CO2 or fertilizer
for the plants at this point.

in an older post on lighting, i saw a suggestion for www.aquatraders.com ,
and i saw this light on there:
http://www.aquatraders.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID;=310

that light looks like it will require no hood on the tank.  do i need
a hood, and can i get something that works as a hood even with this
light?  is 96w way too much?  is a 36 inch bulb too much bulb for a 36
inch wide tank?

With that light you will need to add CO2 or excel at least and
fertilizers.  If you don't want to do fertilizers and CO2 then go with
a bit less lighting and low light plants.

I use glass covers with strip lights on all of my tanks.

A twin tube fluorescent strip, 40 watts, would do nicely for your tank.

I do wish that all new aquarium buyers could be warned in advance that the
hoods they get with their tank is almost always inadequate for even the
least demanding plants and fish viewing. The cost of the full hood is not
very far from the cost of a twin bulb strip light and a glass canopy.

Hi Dan.  Have a look on Ebay for different hoods that might fit your
tank with alternative light suggestions.  My 20H came with a
flurescent hood that held one 18&quot; bulb.  The brightest I could get was
15w for it. MG suggested changing it to CF.  I went onto Ebay and
bought an incandescent hood for $9.  I put 2 20w CF bulbs in there and
all seems well.

Good luck

At stores a double bulb strip is almost twice the price of a single
bulb strip.  At least around here.

I agree.  You should be looking for something more like 50-60W at the
most.  You might be able to find a glass canopy, use your existing 20W
strip, and add a second T8 strip.  Another option if you're handy is
to get an AHSupply retrofit and redo the light fixture in your hood
with a 55W compact fluorescent.  It still won't run the full length of
the tank, but you'll have about the right amount of light and be able
to use your old hood.

I was comparing a single tube hood to a double tube strip. But I didn't do
my homework. I just checked and you're right. A 36&quot; single tube hood is $40,
a 36&quot; twin tube strip is $88. And a retrofit to upgrade from single to
double is $70! At a popular online retailer. Absolutely insane prices.
Nevertheless, I still wish new buyers could be advised that the single 15 or
20 watt tube hood is good for viewing the fish, and that's about it. And
even that would be borderline in a tall aquarium. But if a retailer made
that suggestion to the first time buyer, it would appear as if she was
trying to bait and switch the advertised &quot;complete setup.&quot;

I agree here. You can get 6400 K CF bulbs that will fit standard inc.
fixtures tht will range from 9 to 110 watts and these can be
releatively inexpensive. This can also be a DIY project using a hood
and added the sockets/fixtures yourself.

in an ideal world, would this tank have 2 bulbs that spanned the
entire length of the tank rated between 40-60w total?  is the wattage
additive?  2 20w bulbs would be 40w?  is a 28 inch bulb rated at 20w
the same as a 36 inch bulb rated at 20w?

also, can i buy a fixture rated at 96w, and put in a bulb rated for
50w?

thanks for all the suggestions!  i'll look around and see what the
best solution will be.

Yes, wattages add.  Your comparison of a 24 vs 36 inch bulb at 20W is
not relevant.  If you were to somehow find a 36&quot; bulb rated at 20W,
yes it would count as 20W.  Standard T8 and T12 bulbs for aquarium
fixtures are:
18&quot;- 15W
24&quot;- 20W
36&quot;- 30W
48&quot; - either 32W T8 or 40W T8 or T12.

Compact fluorescent T5 bulbs are a bit more efficient and brighter per
watt, but not enough that you need to calculate differently.

Two standard bulbs that span the entire tank would be a total of 60W
and would work well for medium light plants.  Adding a 30W strip to
your existing 20W one would give 50W and also work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; also, can i buy a fixture rated at 96w, and put in a bulb rated for
&gt; 50w?

As far as I know, you can't.  My understanding is that the ballasts
are matched to the bulb wattage and the 96W ballast would fry a 55W
bulb.
