hello, i bought an 85 240 from the original owners. it seems to be in
great shape. this is my first volvo and a complete bargain for $500,
they just bought a brand new volvo and wanted this one off of their
hands.  What can i do to ensure the longevity of this car.  Any extra
pampering needed to certain parts, systems? what seems to be the most
common problem and how can i prevent it? thank you all in advance! amy

Change the oil and filter every 2000 miles.

Keep it tuned up.

Drain and change fluids now in transmission and rear end.

2000? Not to start a flame war but that's ridiculous, 3000 is overkill,
5000 is reasonable, I usually aim for 4000 though so it's not a big deal
if it's a bit late.

I have changed oil that frequently for over 25 years.

This has led, in ALL the vehicles I've maintained, to extended life and
minimal problems.

Coincidence?  I think not...

The poster wants to "ensure the longevity" of her $500 car, and that is
the best way to do it.

Hi,

There is no reason to change the oil any more frequently than every
3000 miles just as the manufacturer of every car in the whole world
recomends. The added expense of changing the oil any more frequently
than that could be used to defray the cost of something useful, and oft
neglected. A good tune up will not only extend the life of the car, but
increase performance, and fuel economy. New plugs and wires are a great
idea. A go over of the flame trap(PCV) system is a pretty good idea. A
new air filter is a must if the one included with the car looks worn.
Chemical treatments may not work too well, but an actual pressure
cleaning of the fuel injectors may help. The B series engine equipped
on the 2 series Volvos are basically BOMB PROOF. If a few simple
maintenance procedures are done regularly, you should have 0 problems.
It really is a question of how well, and efficiently you want the car
to run. Then again, when I do buy a used car, I tend to want to change
the oil every 1000 miles for the first 3000 miles or so to clean it out
just in case. Don't skimp on the oil,  But don't go overboard either. A
good quality oil should be good enough, don't go cheap, but there is no
need to put anything special in there either.

I have been driving everywhere in an '86 740 that I absolutely love. It
cost me in fact $500. A couple of oil changes to get the kinks out, and
a good tune up to do all of the preventive maintenance that always
winds up getting done correctively, and voila, I'd drive it anywhere.

Best -O- Luck,
-Z-
