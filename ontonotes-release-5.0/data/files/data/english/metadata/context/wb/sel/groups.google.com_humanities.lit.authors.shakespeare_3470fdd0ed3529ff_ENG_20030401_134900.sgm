On this Shakeapeare quiz &quot;&quot;
there is a question about how many suicides there are in Shakespeare's
canon.

Their answer lists an &quot;unlucky thirteen times&quot;:

2 in Romeo and Juliet, both the lovers.
3 in Julius Caesar: Cassius, Brutus and Portia
1 in Othello: Othello
1 in Hamlet: Ophelia
1 in Macbeth: Lady Macbeth
5 in Antony and Cleopatra: Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and
Eros

I know that they are missing Goneril from Lear, Titinius from Caesar,
and aruguably Timon of Athens (although no one ever sees, or reports
seeing, the body, so he could have faked his death.) This brings the
total to 16.

Any others that I am forgetting?

And in a recent article in the (UK) Sunday Times it was claimed
that Julius Caesar deliberately brought about his own death.

--------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The Phoenix was the Egyptian symbol for the rising sun and the hieroglyph
for the sun. In Chrsitian symbolism the Phoenix represents resurrection and
immortality.&gt;&gt; - New Century Handbook
--------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Phoenix said to live a certain number of years, when it makes in
Arabia a nest of spices, sings a melodious dirge, flaps his wings to set
fire to the pile, burns itself to ashes, and comes forth with new life,
to repeat the former one.&gt;&gt;

&quot;If she be furnished with a mind so rare,
She is alone the Arabian bird.&quot;
Shakespeare: Cymbeline, 1.7.

Phoenix Period or Cycle, generally supposed to be 500 years;
Tacitus tells us it was 250 years;
R. Stuart Poole that it was 1,460 Julian years,
like the Sothic Cycle; and Lipsius that it was 1,500 years.

The phoenix is said to have appeared in Egypt five times:

(1) in the reign of Sesostris, B.C. 866 ;
(2) in the reign of Am-asis, B.C. 566;
(3) in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphos, B.C. 266;
(4) a year or two prior to the death of Tiberius, A.D. 34;
(5) and during the reign of Constantine, A.D. 334.
(Elizabeth's first birthday, A.D. 1534.)

(These dates being accepted, a Phoenix Cycle consists of 300 years.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
LADY MACBETH: Here's the smell of the blood still:
all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh, oh, oh!

&lt;&lt;The symbolism of the Lunar and Solar Deities is so inextricably mixed
up, that it is next to impossible to separate such glyphs as the EGG,
the lotus, and the &quot;sacred&quot; animals from each other. The ibis, for
instance, sacred to Isis, who is often represented with the head of that
bird, sacred also to Mercury or Thoth, because that god assumed its form
while escaping from Typhon, -- the ibis was held in the greatest
veneration in Egypt. There were two kinds of ibises, Herodotus tells us
(Lib. II. c. 75 et seq.) in that country: one quite black, the other
black and white. The former is credited with fighting and exterminating
the winged SERPENTs which came every spring from Arabia and infested the
country. The other was sacred to the moon, because the latter planet is
white and brilliant on her external side, dark and black on that side
which she never turns to the earth. Moreover, the ibis kills land
SERPENTs, and makes the most terrible havoc amongst the EGGs of the
crocodile, and thus saves Egypt from having the Nile infested by those
horrible Saurians. The bird is credited with doing so in the moonlight,
and thus being helped by Isis, as the moon, her sidereal symbol. But the
nearer esoteric truth underlying these popula myths is, that Hermes, as
shown by Abenephius (De cultu gypt.), watched under the form of that
bird over the Egyptians, and taught them the occult arts and sciences.
This means simply that the ibis religiosa had and has &quot;magical&quot;
properties in common with many other birds, the albatross
pre-eminently, and the mythical white SWAN,
the SWAN of Eternity or Time, the KALAHANSA.
----------------------------------------------------------------
EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY - BENU

In ancient Egyptian mythology she is associated with the sun god.
She is called &quot;Benu&quot; / &quot;the Ascending One&quot;.

&lt;&lt;The Bennu bird was an imaginary bird resembling a heron. It had a two
long feathers on the crest of it's head and was often crowned with the
Atef crown of Osiris (the White Crown with two ostrich plumes on either
side) or with the disk of the sun. This name apparently was being
associated during the earlier periods of Egyptian history with various
birds: the crane, the heron, the stork or the flamingo. Later it was
more clearly identified with the heron. She was a kind of primordial
god, which built its nest on the WILLOW which is on the top of the
primordial hill.

The Bennu was the sacred bird of Heliopolis. Bennu probably derives from
the word weben, meaning &quot;rise&quot; or &quot;shine.&quot; The Bennu was associated with
the sun and represented the ba or soul of the sun god, Re. In the Late
Period, the hieroglyph of the bird was used to represent this deity
directly. As a symbol of the rising and setting sun, the Bennu was also
the lord of the royal jubilee. The BENNU was also associated with the
inundation of the NILE and of the creation. Standing alone on isolated
rocks of islands of high ground during the floods the heron represented
the first life to appear on the primeval mound which rose from the
watery chaos at the first creation. This mound was called the BEN-BEN.
---------------------------------------------------------
The BENNU was also considered a manifestation of the resurrected
Osiris and the bird was often shown perched in his sacred WILLOW tree.
----------------------------------------------------------------
[Hamlet (Folio) 4.7]

Queen. There is a WILLOW growes aslant a Brooke,
That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The BENNU was associated with the inundation of the NILE
and of creation.

The BENNU bird is said to arise
'at dawn from the waters of the NILE'.

July 16, 622 NILE inundation
------------------------------------------------------------------
Eqyptians of the Pyramidic noticed that the beginning of
the NILE inundation occurred annually about July 16th
with the heliacal (i.e., with the Sun) rising of Sirius.

(The Muslim lunar calendar starts with Mohammed's journey
from Mecca to Medina on July 16, 622.
1001 SOLAR years later the First Folio was published.)

Two Arabian eclipses occurred on eve of RAMadan,
1001 A.H. &amp; 1002 A.H., respectively:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
At about 1 PM on May 30, 1593 (Gregorian) London experienced a
partial eclipse of the sun while VENUS was in conjunction with SATURN.
The path of the total eclipse started in South America, passed over
the Sahara and ended in Arabia. Barely a year later (May 20, 1594
{Gregorian}) another total eclipse rose (Phoenix like) out
of Arabia (between Mecca to Medina) and passed over the
(former) empires of Tamerlane and Nebuchadnezzar.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
GRIFFIN, Griffon or GRYPHON

&lt;&lt;A hybrid monster with the head and talons of an Eagle and the body of
a Lion. Herodotus says it lives in the mountains of India and builds its
nest out of gold; later, in the Middle Ages, Sir John Mandeville said
it abounded in Bacharia. It resembles the winged Bull of Assyria,
the Sphinx of Egypt, the Simurgh of Persia, the Garuda of India, and
the Roc of Arabia in that it was so huge it could BLOT out the sun.&gt;&gt;

Indeed, a modern
example of such stone-worship is the much venerated blackstone kept in
the Ka'aba shrine in Mecca, Western Saudi Arabia, which is thought by
geologists to be a meteorite recovered in antiquity (A further
discussion on sacred meteorites will be found in my forthcoming article
&quot;The Fetish Of Ammon and Alexander The Great: an investigation on the
meteoritic connection&quot;).
----------------------------------------------------------------
INVESTIGATION ON THE ORIGINS OF THE BENBEN STONE:

Was It An Iron Meteorite?

By Robert G. Bauval

Published in Discussions in Egyptology, Volume 14, 1989
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;It is also often argued that the phoenix, a mythical bird which was said
to appear at dawn perched on a pole extending from a Benben, was
representative of the sun-god's self-creating power (Breasted, p.72).
But the phoenix's cosmic identification was by no means exclusive to the
sun. In the Middle Kingdom, for example, the phoenix was also said to be
the soul of Osiris, as well as the moon and sometimes the 'morning star'
i.e. Venus (Rundle Clark, p.246-9). The phoenix thus was symbolic of the
rebirth at dawn not only of the sun-god but of cosmic beings in general.
In The Book Of The Dead, Chapter 83 entitled 'Spell For Becoming The
Phoenix (Bennu) Bird', the phoenix claims: &quot;I am the seed corn of every
god...&quot; (Rundle Clark, p.249). His power of self-creation clearly
symbolised the emerging (rebirth) of celestial bodies (gods) at dawn
from the underworld, the tenebrous land of the dead below the horizon.

One Fried Potatoe
------------------------------------------------------
PALESTINE, W.Va. (AP)- More than a week of worry over Army Pfc. Jessica
Lynch quickly turned into a gleeful celebration with blaring sirens and
fireworks as her family and friends rejoiced over her rescue in Iraq.

Lynch's family was told about 6 p.m. Tuesday that the 19-year-old supply
clerk with the 507th Maintenance Company had been rescued from an Iraqi
hospital by American troops.

&quot;I thought at first it was an April Fools joke,&quot; said her father, Greg Lynch
Sr. &quot;I thought this was a cruel joke. I can put up with most things, but not
that. They assured me, no, it's not a joke.&quot;

About 20 friends gathered at the family's two-story, wood-framed house
Wednesday morning to eat a breakfast of fried potatoes and bacon and wait
for word on Lynch's condition.

When Jessica Lynch finally talked to her father she told him how hungry she
was after not having eaten for eight days. Greg Lynch Sr. told her &quot;I'll put
on some fried potatoes.&quot; (Jessica hates fried potatoes.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On this Shakeapeare quiz &quot;http://www.pbs.org/now/quiz/quiz4.html&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is a question about how many suicides there are in Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; canon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Their answer lists an &quot;unlucky thirteen times&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 in Romeo and Juliet, both the lovers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 in Julius Caesar: Cassius, Brutus and Portia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in Othello: Othello
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in Hamlet: Ophelia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in Macbeth: Lady Macbeth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 in Antony and Cleopatra: Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eros

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that they are missing Goneril from Lear, Titinius from Caesar,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and aruguably Timon of Athens (although no one ever sees, or reports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing, the body, so he could have faked his death.) This brings the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; total to 16.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any others that I am forgetting?

Don't sell yourself short, Art -- you're FAR more VERsatile a fool
than that!

It was not April 1 when you declared that Anne Hathaway was
Shakespeare's mother. It was not April 1 when you extolled the
remarkable property of the number 19 (that it is the sum of two
consecutive integers and the difference of their squares). It was not
April 1 when you proclaimed that Virgil predated Herodotus. It was not
April 1 when you identified Aleksandr Nevskii as &quot;tsar.&quot; It was not
April 1 when you ascribed a sense to the word &quot;moniment&quot; that it did not
acquire for roughly another seVERal centuries. It was not even April 1
when you concluded, from the death in the 9/11 WTC attacks of a
middle-aged industrial manager named Peter Gay roughly a quarter of a
century too young, that the renowned historian Peter Gay had perished --
and incidentally that, because the historian Peter Gay was supported by
the Mellon Foundation, Gay must have traveling to New York to collect
his grant check -- IN PERSON -- at the Mellon Bank in Manhattan when the
tragedy occurred!

No, your image of &quot;Lear jumping off a cliff&quot; (when combined with your
history of hilarious howlers) qualifies you as a uniVERsal Renaissance
Idiot, not a mere April Fool.

I've written over 10,000 HLAS posts and Webb has kindly checked them all

Ha! If you think that the above is all that I could find, Art, then
either you haven't been paying any attention at all or your memory is
even worse than Richard Kennedy's. Indeed, correcting even a VERy small
fraction of the hilarious howlers of aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut
would be the work of seVERal lifetimes, and it certainly isn't worth a
small fraction of even one. HoweVER, the above are among your funniest
blunders.

HoweVER, it is still worthwhile reading your posts for amusement --
one would hate to miss out on a spectacle as funny as
aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut proclaiming that Lear jumped off a
cliff (What next? Will you next inform us that Hamlet died by drowning
when &quot;an envious sliVER broke,&quot; or that he was skewered by mistake while
eavesdropping behind an arras?!) or aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut
declaring that Virgil predated Herodotus.

Incidentally, Art, congratulations upon your 10,000 posts -- I didn't
realize that you had been impersonating a moron so successfully on such
a grand scale. I don't think that even the sublimely gifted Quino, a
humorist of genius, managed to keep up his comic inventiveness THAT
long! It's almost as remarkable as Joe di Maggio's hitting streak --
although of course yours is an uninterrupted succession of misses.

P.S.: If you wish to REView more of Art's Greatest Misses, I might be
able to spare some time to dig up a few.

I've paid enough attention to know that NO Strat (including yourself)
dares to seriously argue with me over what I actually believe. It's sort of
like Saddam hiding in his bunker.

&gt;&gt; Lucrece kills herself.
&gt;&gt; Posthumus tried to get killed in battle, an attempted suicide.

&gt; And most productions suggest that Lavinia knows what Titus is about to do.

"/>

Yes, Lavinia probably knows full well that Titus is going to kill her,
and that he himself will get killed in the following slaughter. But is
that really suicide? I don't know. Is it any different than Brutus and
Cassius getting someone else to hold the sword they &quot;fall&quot; on?

&gt; MND: 'Pyramus and Thisbe'?

&gt; And in a recent article in the (UK) Sunday Times it was claimed
&gt; that Julius Caesar deliberately brought about his own death.

OOOHHHH! That's a good one! But does it count as a real suicide? It is
a representation in play as all the other suicides in the canon are. I
think I'll count it.

What?! Of course I do. You actually believe that those supported by
the Mellon Foundation pick up their grant checks IN PERSON at the Mellon
Bank in New York, which is both idiotic and absolutely hilarious! You
actually believe that only one person on the entire planet could be
named Peter Gay (or Anne Hathaway), which is both moronic and absolutely
hilarious! You actually believe that &quot;I kill Edwasd de Vese&quot; is a
meaningful anagsam, which is both mosonic and hilasious, as befits a
clueless csetin. You actually believe that Oxford wrote Shakespeare's
Sonnet 20, addressing his own penis, which is absolutely hilarious! You
actually believe that Virgil predated Herodotus, which is both idiotic
and absolutely hilarious!

Beyond that, you haven't expressed what you &quot;actually believe&quot;
clearly enough to permit any rejoinder. How does one respond to a
typical aneuendorffer114 ... @comicass.nut post, most of which look like
this:

sdfliuns(N)sdfgoiundsfpounsdfgb(YNHT)sdfgoinsg(G)
