Because the Jews and the Palestinians are BOTH entitled to the contested
territory and they refuse to share due to their religious and cultural
differences. The Jews didn't live there first (they kicked out the
Philistines, remember?) and then they lived there for a couple thousand
years. Then the Jews revolted against the Roman Empire and half of them
were slaughtered and the other halved enslaved (or fled), that's why they
can be found throughout the former Roman Empire. From that time on, the
Palestinians, filling the void, lived there for almost 2000 years until
the the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, when they were kicked out
by the Jews.

In some Western (especially European) capitals people hold the belief that
once they give the Palestinians a state consisting of the West Bank, Gaza
and part of Jerusalem that the two peoples will reconciled, but in my
opinion this is a grave miscalculation. Let me sketch what will happen
when this becomes reality. As soon as a Palestian state is declared and
recognized as a sovereign state the Palestinians will declare that as a
state they must be allowed to have an army. Subsequently the Arab
countries will stuff this Palestinian state full of arms whilst relations
with Israel deteriorate. When a war between them finally does break out,
there will be mass casualties, far larger than we see now, because both
sides will be using heavy weaponry.

Why do I think that relations between Israel and this Palestinian state
will deteriorate? Because I'm convinced the Palestinians have never given
and never will give up on the idea that all of Palestine (including those
parts which are now Israel) belongs to them. Even if they accept a
Palestinian state they will merely see this as a 'stopgap measure' and
they will argue that 'we now have half of what we wanted, now we want the
other half too.'

I'm predicting that NONE of us alive today will see the
Israeli-Palestinian problem solved and that it may well get worse. I'm not
advocating any 'solution' as there is none, nor do I take sides, since I'm
neither a Jew nor an Arab/Palestinian.

I beg to differ. SEMITIC Jews lived in harmony with SEMITIC Arabs for
700 years in that area.

The interlopers are the Ashkenazi who moved westward from Mongolia to
Russia, spent the next 100 years intermarrying to &quot;westernize&quot; their
oriental features then burst into Europe proclaiming themselves as
&quot;God's People&quot;. They were so offensive that ultimately most or all of
Europe kicked them out. They did ultimately set up an economic system
to which the entire world is now enslaved.

They have no more historical claim on the lands of Palestine than I
would have over the Vatican if I were to convert to Roman Catholicism.

Russia had given a much larger state to the Jews, and for the most
part them Jews turned their pronounced noses as far up and every bit
as high and almighty as they could go.  Therefore, I think the ongoing
problem has been mostly a Zionist swarm mindset of a cult problem,
that as you say there is no possible resolve other than further
collateral damage and the ongoing demise and carnage of the innocent.

Two opposing faith-based swarm like mindsets are going to always fight
to their mutual demise, using every available tactic that's either
made available or takable.

Religions by nature are not into sharing one damn thing, as that's
exactly why there are so freaking many religions and sub-religious
(aka insider) power thirsty groups running amuck.  I believe Jews get
all the credit for having invented sleeper cells, such as back in
those good old Roman partnership days of their having put one of their
very own kind on a stick as a PR stunt.

Nothing is inevitable as it comes to human behavor. In 1946 the French
and the Germans would not have been able to imagine how close friend
those two countries are today. In 1904 the 'Detente Cordial' began
between France and UK, and UK and France hawe never been enemies
since, but before that they had fought all around the world for
centuries.

It once seemed too that the conflict in N-Ireland would last forever.

Given a good Zionist mindset of a swarm like all or nothing, and it
would have lasted forever.

Wars are all about various faith-based arrogance, greed and cultivated
bigotry for a buck, and as such it works every time.  Why otherwise do
you think Cathars were exterminated by the Pope of the day?

War (hot or cold) is nearly always good for those well connected
insiders and/or of big business, even if you're caught with your pants
down on the losing side.

Certain faith-based groups as intellectually and often race-faith
bigoted and otherwise highly connected swarms simply can not get
enough of their fair share of such wars for profit.  If all else
fails, secretly exploit, traumatise, enslave and/or poke at whomever
until they take the first public swing.

It seems the best of perfectly good Jews that wouldn't normally so
much a hurt a Muslim fly, otherwise give into supporting their swarm
agenda, as they are rightfully scared literally to death not to.  Of
course, the same analogy might be imposed upon most other religious
cults that would not allow rational or even deductive thinking outside
of whatever supposed good book they've chosen to hide their sins
within.

If their swarm mindset is into perpetrating whatever hocus-pocus
notions on behalf of their justifying whatever focus of accomplishing
whatever task or ulterior agenda, as in no matters what there's
absolutely no internal moderation or any other forms of policing their
own kind allowed.

Of course, this kind of faith-based swarm intelligence is exactly what
orchestrates the rest of us dumbfounded village idiots into wars (hot
or cold), and otherwise expands and/or extends such wars for the rest
of us to deal with, and that's for as long as it takes.  Sadly, this
is not such a good method of advancing humanity ahead of its natural
evolutionary process, especially when the have's are not exactly into
reasonably sharing with or otherwise benefiting the have-not's.

The winning side is simply not always the side that needed to win a
given tit for tat, and even if the perceived good side prevails is no
insurance that other equally if not worse sorts of bad things are not
going to emerge under a new name, or as whatever secret internal
tribal format that's sustained as invisible or as stealth as were all
of those Muslim WMD and Usama bin Laden.
