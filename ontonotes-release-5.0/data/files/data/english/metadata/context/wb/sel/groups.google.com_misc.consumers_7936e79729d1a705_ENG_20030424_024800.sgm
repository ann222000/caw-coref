Not easily spooked, but getting nervous about foods leaching
into plastic storage containers, esp. during nuking. Some of mine
have &quot;eroded&quot; interiors, making them possibly even more hazardous?
I got rid of them and bought $ome Pyrex in$tead. Guess I trust glass
more.

Are there any reliable studies on this subject?

It's not uncommon for chemicals to leach out of plastics, especially
when they're heated. I share your concern. Glass is completely safe,
unless you're cooking with sulphuric acid.

Some are better than others, and Rubbermaid is among the best -- but
once the surface is damaged, none of it is truly safe. And any container
that's retaining the color or odor of the stored food is clearly a potential
hazard.

IIRC, some governmental agency (FDA?) checks about poisons
leaching from food containers. Since some people turn bread bags
inside out (why??) and then put food in them, this agency
required that the colored ink on the bags stop being poisonous.
They also determined that little flakes of teflon that come off
nonstick cookwave are inert.

No, I'm not making this up. That's why truth is weirder than
fiction. Fiction has to be plausible.
