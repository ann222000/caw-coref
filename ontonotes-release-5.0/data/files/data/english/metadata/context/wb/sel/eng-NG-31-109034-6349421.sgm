Lets suppose that potatos and corn are native to Europe.  What effects
might this have on Europe pre-1492?

I wonder if this would not increse the effeciency of northern European
agriculture, making northern Europe rather more populated.  Scotland
and Ireland and Sweden and Finland do relatively better.

Second, I wonder if this does not increase total population somewhat,
which strengthens the role of towns, makes the  industrial revolution
more likely, and makes disease more deadly.

Finally, I believe that corn is a *much* better animal feed per acre
than wheat or rye.  I would expect a Europe with corn to have more
domesticated animals than one without.

Having more animal feed around would mean that there'd be more
domesticated animals to experiment with breeding/etc. Also potatoes
and corn being native to eurasia means that China, India and Japan are
all stronger. On the negative size:a more populous europe is more
likely to go into "High end equilibrium" trap mode than OTL.

None, if the Europeans don't develop the wild types into something more
productive.

My guess is that there were a number of plants which could have been
domesticated in Europe and in similar-climate areas of Asia, and
weren't.  And that this had something to do with Eurasia having more
domesticated meat animals.

Corn *is* native to Europe.

Check your dictionary, and look at the word's *origins* ...

[Origin: bef. 900; ME, OE; c. D koren, ON korn, G Korn, Goth kaúrn;
akin to L granum grain, Russ zernó]

"Before 900" is the clue. 1492 being the earliest possible contact
(definitively proved) of Europeans with *maize*.

http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=corn

What you *meant* to say, of course, is "Lets suppose that potatoes and
maize are native to Europe."

And, no, its not being pedantic, either - the use of Corn = Maize is
peculiar to North America (not that it is peculiar *in* North America,
or anywhere else, not the several possible meanings of "peculiar",
too) and this newsgroup is NOT peculiar to North America, it is
worldwide, so the wider meaning is more correct (IMO, FWIW).

Corn has a very long and well documented indo-european meaning that
does NOT equal it being Maize *necessarily* (note the "necessarily"
before flying off your perch).

Its presence in Europe changes *everything* on such a fundamental
basis that I don't know where to begin, especially if it is combined
in such presence with potatoes.

Suffice it to say that population growth and density would be faster
and higher than it was historically, *far* faster and *far* higher.

This means larger cities and, almost inevitably, quicker technological
innovation ... so European history looks *vastly* different on so many
levels that it is, as I said, really impossible to speculate in any
logical way because of the multitude of flow on PoDs.

Not according to Diamond's "Guns, Germs and Steel", depending on what
you think of his thesis. He lists most if not all of the cereal crops
with the largest grain size and they are predominantly in Eurasia and
were quickly domesticated at least in their areas of origin. Some were
replaced by crops with larger grains (emmer wheat, for example, IIRC)
but they were all cultivated. The presence of herders had no effect on
it AFAIR.

Potatoes carries a lot of problems compared to grain crops.

The water content makes them difficult to store and transport properly,
so taxes would still have to paid in grain, and the long distance food trade
from the Baltic to the Cities in western Europe would still be in grain

Bread also lend itself better to preservation than food prepared from
potatoes so armies and navies would still be fueled by grain.

Potato crops are also more vulnerableto disease or insect attacks than
most grain crops. It makes quite a difference in a subsistence economy
if you lose almost 100% of a croip compared to 30%.

The biggest impact if potatoes were native to the old world would
imo have to wait until the infrastructure was developed enough
to handle the transportation and storage problems and to supply
areas with failed crops.

Which answers your unasked question.

You didn't mention it so there was no chance of confusion.

It *is* confusing.

I teach ancient history, and the standard translations of, say,
Thucydides and Caesar (amongst others) constantly refer to corn.

Standard texts refer to the Roman "Corn Dole" and the Athenian "Corn
Supply" from the Black Sea.

Which leads to confusion ... if the students think about it (they
never do &lt;sigh&gt;) they would wonder why, if Corn (Maize) was only
brought to Europe post 1492, it was available to the Greeks in the 5th
century BC and the Romand from the 8th century BC.

Common usage is, corn = wheat, barley etc. at least amongst anyone
with pretentions to education (which, I guess, translators of the
greek and latin classics as well as textbook writers do pretend to).

Average crop yields, of corn (Queen's English) in classical times were
on the order of 2:1 to 3:1. That is, for each kilo of seed corn, you
got between 2 and 3 kilos of return. Take away the one kilo you need
for next year's sowing and you get 1-2 kilos surplus.

For  Maize?

Yields are VERY high, a return of 70-80 kilos per kilo of seed sown
being the minimum in even the most marginal (semi-arid) areas, and
yields of 150 kilos are a bare minimum for good land.

Where incomplete climatic adaptation had been achieved, yields were
lower, but still attractive.

In perfect conditions, yields of up to 800 kilos return on a kilo of
seed were recorded in pre-modern times.

Based on the MINIMUM increase, you would gain a 30 fold increase in
food productivity, which means, of course, a 30 fold increase in the
population that could be supported.

The evidence from history of population growth following the adoption
of new crops and/or agricultural practices and technology show that
the population of a region increases to the limit of the expanded food
supply in around a century or so.

Imagine a Mediterranean world with a population and population density
greater than that of China after the adoption of wetlands rice with
2-3 growing seasons per year ... and you get the picture, sorta. Maize
is more productive even than Wetlands Rice.

I suspect that the reason for India's backwardness is socio-religious
rather than population based ... the weird social ethics (to western
eyes) of Buddhism and Hinduism don't work well, at least in the
ancient world, with any real desire for advancement.

I'm sure others will have a better explanation.

But given that you got more calories per acre with Potatoes,
and the lesser amount of work involved, its pretty obvious
why that crop became so popular from the 16thC onwards.

For insects, it depends how soon a native *Colorado Beetle appears.
otherwise, Grasshoppers are the next biggest bane, but they
effect all above ground crops, so its a bit unfair to say they are
more effected by insects.

A Potato starting in Europe would evolve to different types
in areas, reducing Blight effects, same as Rusts not effecting
Grains equally.

Wrong.

The limit on crop productivity is the yield per hectare
of land cultivated.

For instance:

in 1880, the US produced 1.7 billion bushels of maize from
62.5 million acres (27 bushels/acre), and 502 million bushels
of wheat from 38.1 million acres (13 bushels/acre).

At yield/seed ratios of 200 to 1 for maize and 2 to 1 for wheat,
the net harvest from maize would be 26.87 bushels/acre, while
the net for wheat would be 6.5 bushels/acre.

That's 4 to 1, not 30 to 1. Of that 4-to-1 gain, half is
greater yield per acre, and half is the 99% reduction
in yield diverted to next year's seed requirement.

Unless one has land going unsown for want of seed, the
benefit of increased yield per kilo of seed is limited
to that reduction. If the yield per seed kilo is even
2 kilos of grain, the maximum improvement is 100%.

No.

Right.

You simply didn't pay attention to the parameters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The limit on crop productivity is the yield per hectare
&gt;of land cultivated.
">

Indeed, and if you paid attention you wouldn't BE wrong.

Note: The crop yields I was citing as the base for the comparison were
those for the CLASSICAL period (Romano-Greek ... pre medieval), which
were yields of 2-3 per 1 kilo sown.

If I had wanted to compare it with yields from 1800 years later, then
I'd be wrong.

Of course, the proposed what if is that Maize and Potatoes are native
to pre-Colombian Eurasia, so I am not.

NB: Crop yields rose to c. 4:1 in c. 1000 AD, 5:1 in c. 1200 AD, 7:1
in c. 1500 AD, 10:1 in c. 1700 AD, 20:1 by c. 1950 AD and 40:1 by c.
2000 AD.

So what you are doing is taking the somewhere between *threefold* and
*sevenfold* increased figures for 1800 years later and complaining
that the increase I cited over the figures that existed from the dawn
(or reasonable facsimile thereof) of recorded history are ... wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Based on yields expected from classical era agriculture, the yield for
wheat would have been somewhere between 1/3 and 1/7 the yield per acre
cited, or c. 1-4 bushels per acre.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Umm. Your maths are off here. The yield for wheat and the like in
classical agriculture was c. 2-3:1. That is, 1 kilo of seed produced
2-3 kilos of grain. Of which 1 kilo had to be kept for next years
seed.

That means that you would have gotten, with *historically accurate*
yields for the earliest period, a surplus of 6.5 bushels per acre for
the low end and 8 bushels per acre for the high end.

The figures I cited for maize come from the original mesoamerican
origins, pre-dating (or immediately postdating) the Colombian exchange
and, presumably, unaffected by the introduction of eurasian advances
in cultivation, and so would remain the same.

Which would mean, at the very least, a *tripling* of yields.

I suspect the problem with your figures is that maize was incompletely
climatically adapted to the USA, which is a known problem, and one I
cited.

If it had been an *original* Eurasian crop, presumably from the Middle
East, then it could move east and west into similar climate zones,
which is what gave Eurasian agriculture a head start compared to its
American cousin (amongst other things) and, at worst, it would "soon"
have been climatically adapted as Wetlands rice (origins possibly in
Ceylon or Burma) was to China ... originally, not growing because the
growing season was too short, then, later, growing 2-3 crops per
season in the south and one, at least, further north.

&gt;Umm. Your maths are off here. The yield for wheat and the like in

The lower the yield/seed ratio for wheat, and the
higher the ratio for maize, the greater the
benefit of switching from maize to wheat. I used
the values from the ranges you supplied, taking
the low end for wheat and and the high end for
maize.

If the y/s ratio for wheat is higher, then the
maize benefit is higher.

You give a ratio of 2-3 for wheat, and &gt;150 for
maize on good land. So let's take 2.5 for wheat
and 250 for maize.

For instance: A, a Pharaonic peasant, has a
an acre of land, which he sows with 1 bushel of
wheat, yielding 2.5 bushels of wheat harvested,
of which he saves 1 bushel for next year's seed.
Net harvest is 1.5 bushels.

B, a *Pharaonic peasant, has a an acre of land,
which he sows with 1/100 bushel of maize, yielding
2.5 bushels of maize harvested, of which he saves
0.01 bushel for next year's seed. Net harvest is
2.49 bushels, a 66% increase. Not 3-fold or 30-fold.

The difference is in the proportion of harvest
held back as seed.

But what if B sows a bushel of maize on his acre?
Does he get 250 bushels of crop? Of course not.
Maize can yield more per acre, but not that much more.

What if A sows _100_ bushels of wheat on his acre?
Does he get 250 bushels of crop? Of course not.
If he could, he would. Or plant only 1/100 of acre
with 1 bushel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That means that you would have gotten, with *historically accurate*

This was clearly a ridiculous statement.

If maize could be 30 times as productive
_per_ _acre_ as wheat, it would have
displaced wheat all over the Old World.

Peasants and landlords may be traditionalist,
and reluctant to adopt new alien crops, but
the opportunity to have 30 times as much food
(or the same amount of food for 1/30 the effort)
would sway even the most rigid traditionalist.

Well, no.

It is believed by the experts that one of the big changes in
productivity in classical era agriculture was an increase in the
density of sowing of seed ... halving the acreage used for the same
output (though no one is entirely sure when *exactly* this happened,
the assumption seems to be around about the AD/BC juncture, more
likely on the BC side, IIRC).

Which makes exactly squat difference anyway, until the 14th century or
so Europe hadn't, historically, reached its theoretical "carrying
capacity" based on the agricultural techniques available at the time.
In fact, this is thought to be one of the reasons why the Black Death
was so devastating ... the peasantry were already weakened by chronic
malnutrition based on malthusian limits having been reached.

The only difference would be insofar as the availability of maize and
potatoes would mean those population vs. food limits would be reached
sooner, historically speaking.

Actually, you'd most likely be wrong.

Maize was not a European crop, for a start. So that's *obviously*
wrong.

You'd still be wrong, since, if you knew anything about classical and
medieval agriculture, you would know that Barley was the crop of
choice and that yields for Barley, per kilo or per acre, take your
pcik, were higher than yields for Wheat in the classical and much of
the medieval period, in exact reversal of the modern situation (such
were the limitations of the technology used).

It would seem so.

Of course, what he would do is sow 1 bushel and get 30 bushels back.

If you want to make a strawman argument by using figures I never cited
(I have no idea from what fantasy you pulled the 250:1 ratio from,
certainly not anything *I* ever said or cited), then expect to get
called.

I indicated that a c. 30fold increase was reasonably likely.

So peasant B gets 30 bushels surplus for his bushel of maize.

so ... but it has nothing to do with me or reality.

If you knew a little of the history of the matter, you would be better
placed to know that that statement is ridiculous.

Maize was not grown widely in the Old World exactly *because* of
peasant traditionalism.

When it was, it was regarded as a grain purely for animal feed ...
and, of course, allowed massive expansion in the amount and quality of
meat and milk animals kept, which is, of course, just about the most
inefficient way of using it.

Even today, wheat and barley are more commonly eaten by humans in the
Old World than Maize is. Prejudice is a powerful thing.

If it had been a seed grain from the get go in the Old World, that
prejudice would not have applied.

My guess would be that he's figuring that corn takes up more room. From
our small garden when I was growing up you did have to give the corn
plants some good spacing (not only between plants, but leaving a path
between rows), but I can't compare that personally to wheat. An acre of
land will only support so much of a crop, and every one is different.
Not saying he isn't totally wrong, but that's the position he's coming

He would soon be disabused of the notion, 1 hectare of corn (european
usage) produced c. 3 hectoliters (c. 200 kilos each, or c. 600 kilos)
of grain for c. 1 hectoliter of seed by the 17th century. It took
around 3 hectoliters of corn (european usage) to feed one person for
one year ... so they would need around 1.5 ha per person just for
survival, and more than that to pay taxes etc.

There is evidence that the yield weight per hectoliter was also lower
in classical periods than it was in modern times, but it is uncertain
by how much ... just that it was "significant".

During the classical era, yields were around ONE THIRD of that (and,
depending on how far back into the classical era you go, may
effectively have required twice as much land, making yield per ha ONE
SIXTH of that).

And they get one crop per year.

Estimated *pre-columbian* yields of Maize in the valley of Mexico are
at least 3000 to 5000 kilos per hectare TWICE A YEAR.

Say 15-25 times more *per crop* ... gained *twice a year* ... or 30-50
times mor productive, based on a weight per hectoliter of 200 kilos
for corn (european) that only applies to the 17th century or later,
than "corn".

Now, your Egyptian peasant is actually a really, really, poor choice
for comparison purposes.

Egypt is atypical. For obvious reasons, I would have thought.

However, to explain.

The Nile floods. Every year. Fertilising and watering the land in one.

This makes the land vastly more productive than anywhere else, pretty
much, in Europe *FOR A START*.

But it gets better.

The climate means that the Egyptians typically got 2 or even 3 crops
per year on the same land.

So your example peasant will see, fairly quickly, the possibilities of
maize, its yield density etc. and, OK, *HE* will only get a lesser
yield, but the yields I cited for European grain production are
*averages* (so, yes, some lands were *really* marginal because of poor
conditions and short growing seasons), so in the rest of Europe, maize
will be amaizing.

Are you claiming is that maize (under
ancient/medieval conditions) would be
30 times as productive _per_ _acre_
as wheat?

If that's what you're saying, then say it.

If an acre of land can produce 3 bushels of
wheat, or _90_ bushels of maize, maize has
a huge advantage whether one must save 1/3
of the crop as seed, like wheat, or 1/150
of the crop, as you've stated was true for
maize. In the one case, the net harvest per
acre of maize is 60 bushels; in the other
case 89 bushels.

Both are enormously greater than for wheat.

The better yield/seed ratio by itself makes
only a modest difference.

BTW, I note that the peasants of Ireland adopted
the very untraditional potato as their
chief (almost sole) food crop.

Well, actually, that's a slight exaggeration ... possibly, as we don't
know when Maize became *Maize* in the modern sense, the ancestral
plants certainly were inferior to wheat, and still are. Maize as
encountered at the time of the European invasion, however, was ALWAYS
a better crop producing plant than wheat.

You're saying that grain (wheat, barley, oats?)
weighed 2 kg/liter, twice the density of water.

My references indicate that bulk grain density
is from 0.60 to 0.71 as much as water (barley,
buckwheat, rye, wheat; oats is less). This is
sort of irrelevant but it's yet another claim
that seems seriously at odds with common knowledge.

But anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

300 liters ~= 200 kg by my references.

200 kg of grain flour * 2500 calories/kg =
500,000 cal = ~1,400 cal/day

That's reasonable. (At 2 kg/liter, that would
be 4,200 cal/day - a weight-gaining diet.)

OTOH, 300 liters per hectare ~= 21 bushels/acre,
about half the current U.S. yield, and much
higher than the U.S. yield in the 1800s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

which converts to ~600 to ~1000 bushels/acre.

density of maize  0.72 kg/liter
35.24 liters/bushel
2.47 hectares/acre

Present day U.S. farmers get about 150 bushels/acre.

Are you saying that *pre-columbian* Mexicans got 4
to 6 times the yield of American farmers with the
latest hybrids and fertilizers?

In any case, the key constraint is yield per unit of
land, not per unit of seed.

If one has ten hectares to plant, it matters a lot
more whether one harvests 150 or 50 liters/hectare
than whether one sows 0.1 liter or 0.3 liter of
seed per liter of harvest.

Consider four scenarios:

10 hectares x 50 liters/hectare = 500 liters harvest
x 0.3 liter of seed/liter of harvest =
150 liters of seed required =
350 liters net harvest

10 hectares x 150 liters/hectare = 1,500 liters harvest
x 0.3 liter of seed/liter of harvest =
450 liters of seed required =
1,050 liters net harvest

10 hectares x 50 liters/hectare = 500 liters harvest
x 0.1 liter of seed/liter of harvest =
50 liters of seed required =
450 liters net harvest

10 hectares x 150 liters/hectare = 1,500 liters harvest
x 0.1 liter of seed/liter of harvest =
150 liters of seed required =
1,350 liters net harvest

Given a choice between a higher yield/hectare crop and a
higher yield/seed crop, where both improvements are
threefold, which is better? The yield/seed improvement
is a fractional increase in net harvest, while the
yield/hectare improvement is a _multiple_.

Which is why I still don't understand why you said that
the benefit of maize is its higher yield/seed ratio,
and that this higher ratio translated to 30x increased
production, without discussing yield/hectare at all.

They're asking about _maize_, not wheat. Obviously.

Bill J. wants to know about the "unusual characteristics of maize",
and "its breeding by Native Americans", i.e. how did maize

Greetings all

A quick thought based on some partially remembered information:

Wasn't pre-Columbian (perhaps even pre-20th century) maize more
difficult/impossible to digest without proper preparation.

I seem to remember reading/hearing that some North American cultures
insisting on grinding maize with a soft blue-ish stone. Otherwise the food
made from the ground maize produced health problems. Initial European
contactees happily ignored Native American culture and ended up sick or
starving or dead (I can't rmember which).

Whereas wheat (and all Old World grains AFAIK) you can pretty much throw in
the pan and cook or bake.

Potatos are not a problem, unless you try to eat them raw, or until a Blight
comes along.

Double it again, anyway.

You've also got to remember that the classical agricultural system

No. The sources are.

Do modern American farmers get two maize crops a year? I don't expect
so. So you have to factor in incomplete climatic adjustment ... which
you have ignored all along.

Find a source *from the classical period*, not your own personal
speculation based on sources 1000 years or more later, that
contradicts this and I will be happy to look at it.

Again, your lack of basic knowledge and capacity for argument from
irrelevant modern analogy is unfortunate.

Of course, corn isn't, either ... not Barley, not Wheat ... whatever

If I remember right, 7 lbs of potatoes and a pint of buttermilk were
considered an adequate daily diet for a working man.

Maize was not used for human consumption in Ireland until the Famine.

In the Autumn of 1846, having made enquiries of Dunmanway Workhouse
about the effectiveness of treacle and water as a milk substitute, the
Board resolved 'to change the dietary of milk to treacle and water for
breakfast with bread and cheap soup for dinner.' Worse was to come;
from early November 1846 an adult pauper's meal consisted of 10 ounces
of Indian-meal mixed with treacle for both breakfast and dinner.

Indian-corn flour was initially used as a substitute for the oatmeal
in the stirabout the paupers had at breakfast. Attempts were made to
procure the Indian-meal in the quantities required for the Workhouse.
Initial enquiries were made to the Government Stores in Waterford to
supply the meal; however in line with Government policy of the time,
the Central Poor Law Commissioners in Dublin Castle refused to release
this Indian- corn for sale to the Dungarvan Workhouse. A private
contractor named J. Walsh (of Waterford City) eventually offered in
early May to supply 10 tons (6 months supply) at 11 shillings per
hundredweight for yellow meal and 12 shillings per hundredweight of
white meal.

It did not particularly matter to the paupers whether the Board
purchased yellow or white meal as both are almost completely
indigestible by the human body. The most common use for Indian-corn
prior to the Famine had been as an animal feed. Unfortunately the
Board of Guardians were unaware that it's nutritional value to humans
was very limited because the mills in Ireland could not grind it
sufficiently to make it digestible.

The Dungarvan Workhouse was not alone in using Indian-meal as a
substitute for oatmeal and potatoes, Workhouses all over Ireland
seized on Indian-meal as a viable and above all economic solution to
the problem of feeding their inmates. Only hospitalised paupers (on
the recommendation of the Medical Officer of the Workhouse) could
receive alternative rations to the above. When questioned by the
Dublin authorities as to the safety of substituting treacle in lieu of
milk, the Medical Officer for Dungarvan replied 'although it is a
fact, variety of food is conducive to health...he was of the opinion
that the dietary of meal and treacle need not be disturbed, provided
he might prescribe such changes as necessary in individual cases.' The
Board ordered 'that the dietary do stand as at present.'

Not surprisingly, over the following few months a serious outbreak of
dysentery occurred in the house in which quite a few lives were lost.
In early January 1847 treacle was discontinued as a food as it had
obviously contributed heavily to the dysentery outbreak. The Poor Law
Commissioners recommended to the Medical Officer on January 27th 'the
expediency of adopting rice into the diet as a check to dysentery.' It
was not until May that this advice could be acted upon. Rice was
swiftly removed from the diet at the end of May when the dysentery
outbreak had become less prevalent.

Your original statement (see
http://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/browse_thread/thre... )
was:

Average crop yields, of corn (Queen's English)
in classical times were on the order of 2:1 to
3:1. That is, for each kilo of seed corn, you
got between 2 and 3 kilos of return. Take away
the one kilo you need for next year's sowing and
you get 1-2 kilos surplus.

For  Maize?

Yields are VERY high, a return of 70-80 kilos
per kilo of seed sown being the minimum in even
the most marginal (semi-arid) areas, and yields
of 150 kilos are a bare minimum for good land.

Where incomplete climatic adaptation had been
achieved, yields were lower, but still
attractive.

In perfect conditions, yields of up to 800 kilos
return on a kilo of seed were recorded in
pre-modern times.

Based on the MINIMUM increase, you would gain a
30 fold increase in food productivity, which
means, of course, a 30 fold increase in the
population that could be supported.

That is, you said nothing about double cropping,
nothing about fallow land, nothing about yield
per area unit. You asserted that improved
yield:seed ratio _alone_ would increase production
30-fold. Which is _mathematically_ ridiculous.

All that yield/seed improvement can do is reduce
the fraction of harvest consumed by next crop's
seed requirement. If that fraction is 50%, then
yield:seed improvement can at most double net
harvest.

Net harvest = Gross Harvest X (1 - 1 / yield:seed)

If yield:seed was _really_ _bad_, say 1.25. then
a 400% improvement would be possible. To get a
30-fold increase in net harvest from yield:seed
improvement, the starting level would have to
be no better than 1.034 (29 bushels sown to reap
30 bushels of crop).

Which is ridiculous. You stated that the yield:seed
ratios

in classical times were on the order of 2:1 to 3:1

which allows for net harvest gains of 50% to 100%
from improved yield:seed, not 2900%.

Research done a long time ago. Try Braudel's works, especially, if
memory serves me correctly,

Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th centuries
The Mediterranean in the Ancient World
The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II

I'm pretty sure its in the order cited, as far as origin is concerned.

That covers classical and medieval yields in Europe ... but pretty
much any decent book on the economy of classical and medieval europe,
or with a chapter on the agricultural economy of classical and
medieval europe will confirm the output figures I cited of 2-3 bushels
per 1 bushel of seed in the classical period. Depending on their level
of detail, they will also comment on the likelihood that the croop
density changed some time during the classical period, probably
towards the end of BC. And the use of the two field system is, again,
widely known and published.

Then look at Jared Diamond's books, Guns, Germs and Steel etc for a
longer view.

For maize yields, buggered if I remember exactly ... I have the notes,
but not the origin ...

However, try ...

http://www.geocities.com/wasicugohome/chinampa.html
http://www.fao.org/sd/giahs/other_mexico2_desc.asp
http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture14/lec14.html
http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/mexico.htm

... which refer to ancient practises mainly (note that the last one
indicates that up to FOUR crops a year of maize could be achieved and
the second last one notes that SEVEN crops could be ... two of Maize
and five of assorted other things, Squash, Beans, Chillies etc.).

www.agroeco.org/doc/LApeasantdev.pdf
http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y3951E/y3951e05.htm

... which are about modern yields achieved with traditional methods
(i.e. no fertiliser, no machinery)

Which seems to be comprehensive and gels well with my written notes.

It really smacks of a complete intellectual desperation.

The point is, as I said, Maize is far more productive than corn and
would have lead, as I said, to massive population increase over what
was historically achieved with corn.
