Kruschev spoke at the UN----pounded his shoe on the desk, shouting &quot;We will
bury you!&quot;---and was leader of a nation with thousands of nuclear missiles
pointed at US. The Chinese leader is allowed to visit the US, and China has
nukes pointed at us. Iran is not a threat, and no Iranians were among the
9/11 hijackers.

fact, Iran hasn't attacked a neighbor in a hundred years. Study your

I know what the Iranian gov't does, like hanging gay people and
adulterers by construction cranes.  However they were doing this for
some time before Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005.  Compare to someone
like Sadegh Khalkhali, who was a bloody mass murderer, Ahmadinejad
doesn't have blood on his hands.  He doesn't control much of the
Government, Ayatollah Khamenei has control over some of the very sinster
and power groups like the Revolutionary Guard and the Al-Quds brigade.

Iran still have religious minorities, some heavily persecuted like the
Jews and Baha'i, and others like Armenian Christians, who aren't
persecuted so much.  Iran is also a pretty ethnic society, with Persians
about half the population.

So he's a conservative. A conservative who just happens to be sitting
on top of a huge reserve of oil, but I'm sure that doesn't have
anything to do with anything. Although it is difficult not to notice
that how concerned this administration is about nations that support
&quot;Terrorism&quot; appears to be directly related to how much untapped oil
those nations are sitting on top of.

Well, let's see...

The fact that Iran is suppling weapons to the terrorists in Iraq.

The fact that many of the so-called &quot;insurgaents&quot; are Iraqi citizens.

The fact this guy has openly said he wants to kill all the Jewish
people and denies the Holocaust ever took place.

The fact he openly ignores and thumbs his nose at the UN's regulations
and keeps right on working on his nuclear program.

Do you need any more reasons?

The Iranians are allowed to develop nuclear power for civilian purposes, and

disobeying the UN is valid reason for being attacked, then we should attack
the Israelis, because they have been scanctioned by the UN dozens of times

They're not &quot;Terrorists.&quot; They're people who deeply resent us
occupying their country, not unlike Patrick Swayze's character in Red
Dawn. Terrorism is a method, not a person, place or thing that can be
bombed, napalmed or shot by our military. That is the fundamental
error we have been making from the very beginning of The War On
Terror. You can't destroy a method with a cluster bomb.

That shouldn't surprise you. Most of the French and Polish resistance
in world war two was made up of french and polish people who deeply
resented the germans occupying their country. Granted, he's probably
selling arms to pissed off Iraqis and there's probably one hell of a
weapons market in Iraq but I would imagine the Iraqi insurgents are
buying weapons from anybody who will sell them to them, which would be
almost the entire mideast.

The guy doesn't speak english and the only place I've heard the 'No
Holocaust' claim is from the mainstream &quot;liberal&quot; US media, which has
become a bastion of completely unreliable right wing bullshit since
the runup to the 2003 Iraq invasion. But even assuming he did say it
and walks around believing it, stupidity does not warrant invading

warrants the US, our allies and our new pal, &quot;Red State&quot; France (rolls

needs to be taken down, no matter what the cost and no matter how long

America's throat are doing the same thing with Iran. They're not

I didn't state he wasn't dangerous, some of his behavior shows a
confident to arrogant, but insular and not the most intellectually
curious person.  His manner of trying to appease the west and then days
later spouting very belligerent rhetoric is just bad foreign policy. He
should had followed former President Khatami and his presentation and
manners when dealing with the west.

His rhetoric about Israel is sick and alarming, but he also does this
for his domestic as well as an international audience.  Israel has
always been the whipping boy by Arab and Iranian leaders when their
countries' economies are in the pits.  Iran's economy is kind of in the
doldrums, because it is set up as a rentier state, and how it
distributes the petroleum/natural gas proceeds are the focal point of
contention.

His predecessor, Khatami, had the skills to mend ties with the west.
However, the supreme leader and the council of experts call the shots,
and can curtail any Iranian President's agenda.  Much like putting
Persian Jews on trial for espionage.

Ahmadinejad is stupid to spout the vehement anti-Israel rhetoric.
Iran is kind of loathe in the much of the Arab world as Israel with some
exceptions, like Syria and Hezbollah.  It also defeats any overture to
the West.

Iraq was an armed state before the US went to war with it. Pretty much
every household had an AK-47 or a couple.  When Jerry Bremer disbanded
the Iraqi Army, he put many of those Sunni Officers without work who
started the insurgency.  Many of these officers were in the artillery,
which helped make the IUDs that has killed so many people, including US
soldiers.

Much of the money to buy arms is coming from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
States.  The Arms are coming from a myriad of sources, from other Arab
countries, Russians and probably from the US, given that the Pentagon
has one of the largest supplies of AK-47s in the world. We are probably
supplying militias the US believe are friendly to its interest.

The Iraq War wouldn't be over, because the Sunnis know that if the
Shiites take power, the Sunnis aren't going to get it back, and the
Shiites aren't going to share the oil revenue.  There is also a sense of
history and pride, given that the Sunnis have been ruling Iraq for
hundreds of years, they are not going to give up something that they
feel belongs to them.

This has always been a problem with an invasion of Iraq, that it will
split up into three separate entities.

As much as the Shia Arabs find some alliance with Iran, they is always
going to be some diffidence, because over a thousand year animosity
between Arab and Iranian/Persian culture is not going to dissipate
overnight, besides the wounds of the Iran-Iraq war are still quite raw.

War should only be a means of last resort, it is never should be the
answer until all other possibilities have been made.

Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Leadership won't be affected by any air
attack, but some shopkeeper in Isfahan or day laborer in Yazd will be
affected.  I think the US always make a huge mistake by trying to
personalize a country by its leader, when in reality, the country is
much more complex than can fit into your tiny little brain of yours.

Going to War with Iran shouldn't be an option at this moment. If they
detonate a thermo-nuclear (ie fusion) device and ignore protest from the

If that happens, you mouthbreating twit, our economy will TANK. We do not
get our oil from Iran. That's a given. But Iran has the capability of
totally disrupting all oil flowing through the Straits of Hormuz. If the
Straits of Hormuz are mined, or tankers are sunk by Iran, then no oil flows
out. If the oil produced by Saudi Arabia is taken off the world market, oil
prices will skyrocket. If you think $100+/bbl oil will not dramatically
impact every aspect of the economy, you need to wake up. Gasoline will
become much more expensive, as will diesel. That means every link in the

There is still plenty of time to get some sort of deal, or strong UN

they are still years away from making and testing their own bomb.

If the US aim is to occupy Iran, it will get into the same mess as it
is now with Iraq, probably even worse.  If the strategy is to defeat and
destroy the Iranian Armed Forces, and to keep the flow of oil through
the Persian Gulf, it is quite capable and overpowering to destroy Iran's
military in weeks.  Iran doesn't have the flight training, the parts and
capable aircraft or weapons to fight the US.  Iran can disrupt the flow
of oil, but it can't stop it.  The US can easily destroy any of Iran's
offensive capabilities.  If the US uses the F-22 Raptor, it can outfight
and easily destroy the Iranian Airforce. The Iranians have cannibalizing
their F-14 for years, and don't have the complex weapons for the
platform. The Iranian Navy is no match to the US Navy.

What is so disastrous about the Iraq War is not the tactics, but the
strategy.  Ditto with the Vietnam War, Ditto it would be disaster if the
strategy fails if there is a war with Iran.

I never stated that War is cool.  Diplomacy may not be very macho,
but it is much more cost effective than War.

Yes, of course. But we also have to ask who will benefit from a war with
Iran. The oil companies will reap HUGE profits if the Straits of Hormuz are
shut down. Even if gasoline doesn't reach $10/gallon, can you imagine the
profit from $8/gallon? Do you think people would really drive less? I don't.
I think people would continue driving just as much, and would adjust their
budgets accordingly. They would not spend as much on entertainment, or
eating out, or buying new clothes, or such.

But the people who are currently holding on by a thin thread, the
paycheck-to-paycheck/huge mortgage/lots of credit card debt people would
likely be pushed over the edge. What do you do if you live 40 miles from
Atlanta and HAVE to drive to work? Gasoline doubling or trebling in price
would be a large drain on the wallet.

If gasoline became expensive enough, it could affect the entire structure of
the country. Death of the suburbs, and all that.

No, just have some mine sweepers clear a sea lane and kept it clear.
How do you think the Brits evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940? they had one

The Chinese version is even more lethal.  Even if there are some ship

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Before it's all over and done with, he might be seeing some ground
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; zeros
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right there in Iran.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cuhulin

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If that happens, you mouthbreating twit, our economy will TANK. We do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get our oil from Iran. That's a given. But Iran has the capability of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; totally disrupting all oil flowing through the Straits of Hormuz. If
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Straits of Hormuz are mined, or tankers are sunk by Iran, then no oil
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; flows
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out. If the oil produced by Saudi Arabia is taken off the world
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; market,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; oil
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prices will skyrocket. If you think $100+/bbl oil will not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dramatically
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; impact every aspect of the economy, you need to wake up. Gasoline will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; become much more expensive, as will diesel. That means every link in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supply chain becomes more expensive. Try to imagine paying $10 for a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gallon
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of milk. Hell, how about $10 for a gallon of gasoline? Not going to be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  There will be disruption, but the US Navy and the US Airforce can
&gt;&gt; &gt; destroy Iran's offensive capability in a matter of weeks. The US Navy
&gt;&gt; &gt; can destroy any threat Iran can bring to blocking the flow of oil out
&gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Persian Gulf.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Iran isn't Iraq, but it isn't that strong of a country as it is
&gt;&gt; &gt; portrayed to be, it's little navy and its air force can be destroyed in
&gt;&gt; &gt; days if not weeks.

&gt;&gt; If Iran mines the Straits of Hormuz, it's over.

&gt;   No, just have some mine sweepers clear a sea lane and kept it clear.
&gt; How do you think the Brits evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940? they had one
&gt; or two lanes open. Along with escorting tankers, it can be done, there
&gt; may be a huge disruption and panic, but in the end, Whoever is against
&gt; Iran in a Naval War, will prevail.

&gt;&gt; If they use the Russian
&gt;&gt; Sunburn anti-ship missiles(of which they possess a large number), they
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; sink any ship in the Persian Gulf. Guaranteed. They don't have much of a
&gt;&gt; Navy or Air Force, but well-ensconced anti-ship missile can wreak havok.

&gt; The Chinese version is even more lethal.  Even if there are some ship
&gt; sinkings, every Iranian Naval facility will be hit in the first 48 hours
&gt; of a war, the US would put to many attack Submarines in the Persian Gulf
&gt; Lake. The US can pretty much destroy depots at will.
">

The Iranians have likely secured the Sunburns in hardened facilities. But
you miss the point. If tanker captains think there's a chance their ships
will be sunk, they're not going to travel the Straits. If Iran sinks a
tanker or two---the Straits will close. How do you think we'll react if Iran
launches their Sunburns at an aircraft carrier or two? Full blown war will
shut down the Straits. Economic devastation.

Look, the last thing I am advocating is a war with Iran.  However the
Strait of Hormuz is a too vital that one or two tankers sunk will not
deter the US and other countries who need that petroleum and natural
gas.  I assume the scenario of Iran and its power, along with the Strait
of Hormuz as a strategic chokepoint has been war-gamed to death.

It is not just having the weapons, but knowing how to use them,.
The US has satellites that can detect Submarine activity, besides
putting down a sonar line in the Persian Gulf, if they have to, like
what the US Navy did in the Atlantic.   Carriers battle groups can be
far enough away either to give more warning or be out of harm's way.
There is always going to be fear, but destroying Iran's naval offensive
capability, along with some of the Naval Bases like Bandar Abbas.  There
are also some pretty good bunker buster bombs in the USAF inventory.

&gt; There is no foundation to that theory.  Syria under the Assads have
&gt;been vehement enemies with Iraq since the 1970s.  Syria supported Iran
&gt;during the Iran-Iraq war.  The conventional weapons were always in Iraq,
&gt;just unguarded because there were lack of US and Coalition forces to

What theory are you talking about. The military admitted they lost track of an
entire mountain of munitions. They suspect while they were elsewhere the
Iraqi's loaded it all up in trucks and moved it. IOW: The stockpiles had been
recorded by aircraft. Their locations had been located by the invasion. But no
one thought to guard it since the doors had sturdy padlocks on them.

When they finally got around to go back to them, they were gone.

There hasn't been a real war in our lifetime. All anyone has seen are sides
trading pot shots at each other and sometimes connecting.

You can't muzzle the pit bull and watch him snap &amp; growl and call it a fight.
That's how the U.S. has had to fight all their wars for the past 50 years. What
you've seen is little more than the Hatfields and Coy's. The damage result
takes years to accomplish vs seconds.

War would be like Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki. Instant surrender. Almost like that
star trek show where Kirk destroyed the war computers requiring the people to
either talk, or have a REAL WAR! They chose talk.
Trouble is there's no profit in a short war.

The 'Cost' is minimal damage. To end a war you need to show maximum damage and
right away. And let the enemy know you can repeat that damage for years if
necessary.

Desert Storm was a shock. Iraqi's surrendering to drone air craft..

&gt;  Going to War with Iran shouldn't be an option at this moment. If they

There was a guy (Michael A. Ledeen ) on the radio the other day who
wrote the new bookm The Iranian Timebomb.  Basically, his premise is
that Iran could be dealt with WITHOUT using military, but by
supporting the vast major of dissidents already within the country
(whether he means through giving them weapons, or just moral support,
I don't know, only listened to a small chunk of the show.)

But, if some of what he says is true, it might be a good idea.  Among
other things, he mentioned how Iran is ONLY Arabic nation where
thousands of people held a candle light vigil honoring those who died
on September 11th.

Anyway, if nothing else, it'd be a book to read and consider...
