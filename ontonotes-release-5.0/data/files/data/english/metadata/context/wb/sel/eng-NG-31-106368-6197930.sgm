Hi Anne

Well as per usual social services caused some delays so rehab has not quite
started but is just about to start and i'm so excited. The parenting report
went in last week and everybody was happy with that and that suggested an 8
week reintergration period for Joanna and ourselves, if I had my way she'd
just come home and sod the intergration but I suppose it will be nicer for
Joanna to slowly move away from foster parent to us. The delay was caused
because JH wanted to be there on the first week she came home and he couldnt
start until the 7th November. The plan is that they will pop in to see us
whilst we have her for an hour each time just to make sure Joanna is well
cared for and then we're left to get on with it. I just can't wait but it's
going to be so weired not having ANYBODY looking at us whilst we're with our
daughter. There's so much I want to do with her, I want to go out walking
with her, just me and her, just a precious moment together. Ohh i'm getting
excited just writing this, i'm almost like a little child waiting for
Christmas to come but saying that I am waiting for Christmas to come because
that's going to be awesom as well to spend it with my daughter who I nearly
lost not once but twice. Once to a near M/C and then to the rotten social
services and I hadnt even done nothing wrong. JH has been really good and
understanding of me and my past problems and we all now know the underlying
cause and he is counsiling me through that so that I don't crash again. So
anyway all is brilliant so get your pushchairs out because we're going
walking aroung the world doing the conga.

April
