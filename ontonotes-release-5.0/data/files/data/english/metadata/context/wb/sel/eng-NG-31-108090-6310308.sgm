A bit ahead of time? :-)

Betting people always go for name recognition, which sometimes makes for
good gambling when you really know the sport. Problem is, in that case all I
could go for is a "not Rossi" bet, because I have no iea who it'd be...

Wasn't Rossi the odds-on favorite to be world champion right up until
he threw it into the gravel at Valencia last year?

Well, mebbe. Â Bear in mind that the odds reflect where the money is
going, not what the bookmaker thinks will happen.

&gt; No, he really lost it with 3 mechanical failures prior,thanks to
&gt; Yamaha and Michelin, he would have had 60 points plus lead going into
&gt; the last race...

This conveniently ignored Hayden's clutch problems, and the Pedrosa kamikaze
incident.

Funny how Hayden was testing numerous things last year, even after he
accumulated a pretty good points lead. In my opinion, he won the title,
in spite of Honda's efforts.

Sounds like Rossi then.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ped only punted Hayden once.As per above, Rossi should have had the

&gt; points ahead going into the last race, ie already Championship.

Conveniently ignores Hayden's clutch problems.

Rossi was leading into the last round, but he choked and blew it, and Hayden
didn't. Looks fair &amp; square to me
