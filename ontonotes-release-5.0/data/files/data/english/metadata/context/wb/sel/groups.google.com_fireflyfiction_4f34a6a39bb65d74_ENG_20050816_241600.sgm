His eyes scanned the sheet on his desk. Text scrolled down the page next to the
photos. Followed by a number. A contact number. Every medical center that he
knew, and probably every one he didn't, had this sheet.

Stephen and Katie Hoffman looked nothing like the pictures of Simon and River
Tam. Not even with clever disguises or corrective surgery could his patient be
the person they were looking for. The fact still remained, however, that they
weren't what they claimed. And they fit the bill of being connected to a
Firefly Class transport ship.

Well, they were connected to a Firefly compatible shuttle. It just didn't seem
to click into place. From what little he'd seen of her, Katie Hoffman did not
seem like a particularly dangerous fugitive, neither did her husband. She had
seemed honest in a Universe where that was rare. But she had lied. To him.

Dr. Williams's hand hovered over the com deck as he tried to decide.

***

&quot;Hey.&quot; Kaylee stood by the table and watched as Wash turned to meet her. &quot;How
are you doing in here?&quot;

&quot;Katie?&quot; He whispered and she had to stop herself from gasping at the dark
shadows under his eyes. &quot;You came back?&quot;

She bit on a frown, sat down across from him and looked at the papers he had
collected. They were blank pages. A lot of them. Her back bristled as someone
walked behind her and she relaxed only slightly when it turned out to be
another patient shuffling past.

&quot;Of course I came back.&quot; Leaning forward, she picked up his hand and held it in
hers. It was cold. &quot;I couldn't leave you here by yourself.&quot;

&quot;I thought...&quot; His eyes couldn't focus on her as he looked left to right,
anywhere but at her. &quot;I mean... with the...&quot;

&quot;I managed to get the laundry done.&quot; She continued. &quot;I found that shirt with
the lamb on it. You know? The lamby toes? It's still good.&quot;

Kaylee held her breath. He didn't react, didn't even blink, there wasn't even a
twitch of the hand she was holding. This was getting to be a little too much.
She tried to shake it off, tried to continue the charade.

&quot;I was talking to Dr. Williams just then...&quot;

&quot;The doctor?&quot; This he reacted to. &quot;I like him.&quot;

&quot;Yes. He's nice. He was suggesting we try a new drug and I think...&quot; She hoped
he'd get her meaning. &quot;I think it should work. I think this is what we've been
looking for.&quot;

&quot;New medicine?&quot; He managed slowly. &quot;For me?&quot;

His eyes were a good five seconds behind as he followed the up and down
movement of her nod. Kaylee found her hands shaking. She wanted to be back on
Serenity, all of them, everyone safe and back to normal and not being watched
by the orderlies and guards standing in the doorways.

&quot;Yes.&quot; She insisted as his hand slowly slipped from hers. &quot;I really hope this
one works. It sounds perfect.&quot;

&quot;The doctor knows what he's doing.&quot; Was his stilted reply as he leant his head
back and stared open mouthed at the ceiling. &quot;They'll work if he says so.&quot;

&quot;It doesn't need to be this good.&quot; She whispered suddenly, so low that she was
sure no one else could hear. &quot;You're making me nervous.&quot;

***

Jayne lay back on the bench, pressing the weights easily. There wasn't much to
do now that they were stocked up and Mal had them all ship bound. He didn't
know how Mal expected them to keep living here if they didn't get jobs. Or
laid. He was supposed to sit here day after day on a moon without a half decent
whore house. Hell, it seemed like everyone else on board was getting their
rocks well and truly seen to. As if that wasn't enough, he now had to deal with
a budding relationship between River and Kaylee.

&quot;I won't tell you.&quot;

He cursed as he opened his eyes to see River's head floating over the rails of
the gangway above him. Her hair trailed down around her face, framing it, and
she looked at him with a serious expression. He wasn't exactly sure what she
was talking about, but he wasn't fool enough to ask.

&quot;Hell, girl, I don't want to know.&quot;

&quot;Yes you do.&quot; A smile came over her lips and her eyes glittered down. &quot;Ever
since you found out. You think about us. Want to know what we do.&quot;

Even Jayne could follow that train of thought.

&quot;Ain't none of my business.&quot; He grabbed the small towel he kept for his
workouts and sat up, intensely aware of her presence in the cargo bay now. &quot;Go
away.&quot;

&quot;It's prettier than the pictures in your head.&quot; She continued. &quot;All soft and...&quot;

&quot;River?&quot; Simon's voice echoed through from some point Jayne couldn't see.
&quot;Don't tease the animals.&quot;

Jayne watched as she tossed her hair over her shoulders and flounced away.
There were reasons Jayne wasn't comfortable with the thought of mind reading.
And that there little display was one of them. Her sullen voice carried back to
him.

&quot;He started it.&quot;

***

The shuttle hovered in mid air.

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Inara spoke to the screen, her blood freezing. &quot;There must be some
mistake, I have a standing appointment with the doctor, if only you could check
again.&quot;

But the boy didn't even have the grace to lower his eyes and pretend to do as
she asked.

&quot;Your name isn't here. There's no record of you ever meeting with the doctor.
You might try contacting him, but until then I cannot give you leave to
land.&quot;

Inara looked at the boy, the same boy that had smiled at her and gave her
docking permission in the medical quarters two days running. There was no
denying what had just happened. She felt her hand tremble as she turned the
shuttle around.

***

River prowled the ship, uneasy, her skin itched. There were currents running
through and she shied away from them, her head ducking under waves of air that
no one else could see. They were too busy creating them.

Her hand fell onto a large pipe that wound its way around the walls, snaking
into spaces and flowing between them. Mal, Zoe and Simon were talking on the
bridge and they were idiots. Babes in the woods. For all that they knew and
said they understood, River smiled, they still didn't quite grasp that she
could. Read. Their. Gorram. Minds.

Secret meetings were useless.

***

She helped him walk back to his room. Kaylee's nerves were growing tighter and
tighter as the day wore on. Not once in the hour she had been with Wash had he
given her a sign, any sign, that he even knew who she really was, or who he
was. The act of Stephen Hoffman was becoming too good for her liking.

&quot;Ah, there you are.&quot; Kaylee turned in surprise to see Dr. Williams walking
towards them down the hall. &quot;I've been looking for you.&quot;

&quot;Here we are.&quot; She tried to smile as they stood just outside the door. &quot;I
thought you didn't work in the afternoons.&quot;

&quot;Hey doc.&quot; Wash mumbled, then looked confused at his own words. &quot;Did I...?&quot;

&quot;You're looking better today. Why don't you go have a lie down?&quot; Dr. Williams
patted him on the shoulder, before turning a tight smile to Kaylee. &quot;Most of
the times, I don't. There's been a few problems with the paperwork, though,
minor things. I just need to go over them with you. If that's okay?&quot;

Kaylee's mouth went dry.

&quot;Um, sure, okay.&quot;

She guided Wash into the room and gave him a look which he failed to return.
More and more she felt she was out on the limb by herself. It terrified her. As
she followed the doctor to his office, the echo of their footsteps on the tiled
floor matched the growing thunder of her heartbeat.

&quot;Sit down.&quot; He gestured for the chair. &quot;These files you gave me, they're
correct, yes?&quot;

She nodded.

&quot;As much as they can be.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, yes.&quot; Kaylee couldn't tell if he was agreeing with her or playing
with her as he leaned against his desk and scanned what she assumed was Wash's
file. &quot;Just traveling, wasn't it? Ran into some trouble. That's right, I
remember now.&quot;

He looked her straight in the eyes, his hands clasped together, and his face
set coldly. It made her shiver and she knew.

&quot;Tell me, Katie, you ever see a Firefly Class transport ship?&quot;

***

&quot;Katie Hoffman.&quot; Inara insisted again. &quot;Is she working here this afternoon? I
need to talk to her.&quot;

&quot;Look, Ma'am, I just told you.&quot; George Webber looked her straight in the eye
and didn't blink. &quot;No one by that name works here. I haven't taken on any extra
help in months now. I think, maybe, you've got the wrong tech yard.&quot;

She couldn't breathe. Inara knew perfectly well this was the yard, she had
spoken to this man herself when she had organized the job. He was a friend of a
friend and had come highly recommended as reliable and discreet.

&quot;I'm sorry to bother you.&quot; She managed. &quot;My mistake.&quot;

It wouldn't do to cause a scene right here. She had to get off this world as
soon as possible and bringing undue attention to herself was not the way to
accomplish that.

A small sound stopped her as she walked past the gate.

&quot;I didn't want to tell them.&quot; Inara looked down at a small face, miserable and
tear stained. &quot;She was really nice. I liked her. But my mom needs help,
too.&quot;

***

Panic surged in her. Kaylee honestly didn't know how she was managing to walk
straight, to let the doctor lead her back to Wash's room without falling apart.
Her knees were putting up a big struggle to hold her up.

&quot;Well, that's about it.&quot; Dr. Williams continued to smile, but she knew he was
only stalling for time. &quot;Why don't you wait here? I have some colleagues
meeting me later and they'll be able to discuss that new treatment therapy with
you and your husband in much more detail than I possibly could.&quot;

She knew, even before the door closed behind her, she knew that she would hear
the hiss of the lock, the beeps of an electronic code. They were locked in and
there was no way out.

&quot;Wash.&quot; Her hand came up to her mouth, tried to stop the tears. &quot;They know.
We're so screwed.&quot;

&quot;Katie?&quot; He looked at her, confused. &quot;What did the doctor say?&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; It burst out, voice shaking and she didn't care anymore. &quot;It doesn't
matter now, don't you get it, Wash? It's over!&quot;

&quot;Wash?&quot; He blinked. &quot;I already had a bath...&quot;

&quot;Oh no. No, no, no.&quot; Kaylee stood frozen. She could feel every last article of
heat leave her body as realization came. This must be what it feels like, she
thought, to be free floating in space without an atmo suit. &quot;This isn't an act
for you is it?&quot;

***

&quot;Mal?&quot; Inara's voice came surging through the cortex. &quot;Mal? Zoe? Please be
there! Mal? Someone answer me!&quot;

Mal jumped to attention, his feet falling from their place propped up against
the controls as he motioned for Zoe to close the door to the bridge. He grabbed
the speaker.

&quot;I'm here, Inara, what is it?&quot;

&quot;We have a problem.&quot; He could hear the tears in her voice. &quot;Mal, I'm so sorry.&quot;

&quot;What happened? Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;It's not me.&quot; She sounded so small. &quot;It's Kaylee. She's disappeared. I can't
reach her, they say they haven't heard of her at the yard, she's not at the
house, at least she's not answering any messages. It's a wall of silence.&quot;

A pause and Mal guessed what was coming.

&quot;I think they know who she is.&quot;

***

Simon busied himself with cataloguing the new inventory that Mal and Zoe had
bought back, the actions done almost without thought. Restocking medicines.
Topping up dressing supplies. It was comforting.

The lights flickered, went out for a second before coming back on. His eyes
flew to the window, checked to see River sitting on the sofas of the common
room outside. She looked up at him.

He counted to three and the lights flickered again.

His hands shook as he left whatever he was holding on the bench, forgotten, and
walked to the door.

&quot;River?&quot;

She was already standing, waiting for him.

&quot;Code. I know.&quot; Her face was calm. &quot;Put me in my room.&quot;

&quot;That's not...&quot; But he stopped, knew it was useless. &quot;It's just for now, mei
mei.&quot;

&quot;It's starting.&quot; She said and cocked her head to the left. &quot;Crashing down. You
don't want me to know. Volatile. Unpredictable.&quot;

River took the few steps to the passenger dorms and easily stepped inside her
own. When she looked at him, an eerie smile hovered over her face and he felt a
chill.

&quot;They want to leave us here. They won't tell us what's happening and we'll be
stretched taut with worry. You can't know, because I'll find out.&quot; She sat down
at the very head of her bed, right next to the blinking panel of lights.
&quot;Everyone's so scared of me.&quot;

&quot;Not of you, mei mei.&quot; He stepped inside and closed the door. &quot;For you. There's
so much we don't...&quot;

&quot;Know. I know.&quot; River sighed, distinctions that didn't matter, he didn't see.
&quot;You don't need to worry, Simon. You can all play your games, but they won't
leave without me.&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot;

Simon didn't have to wait long.

&quot;River?&quot; Mal's voice came tight and angry over the com right next to River's
head. &quot;What the hell have you done to my gorram shuttle?&quot;

River smiled.

***

He closed himself off. There had been no other way. He had even given her
another chance and she sat there and lied through her teeth at him. Lied. He
led the way to one of the viewing rooms. This one had a clear view into the
Hoffman room, a two way mirror giving perfect access to the scene inside.

The two men followed silently, ushering in two children. A girl and a boy. Dr.
Williams estimated them to be about thirteen or fourteen. They all stopped to
watch the room in front of them.

She was pacing, wringing her hands as she walked back and forth across the tiny
space. Her husband sat on the bed, watching her, confused.

&quot;He's useless.&quot; The children said. &quot;He is who he thinks he is, there's nothing
there.&quot;

Dr. Williams watched them look through the glass again.

&quot;Kaywinnit Lee Frye.&quot; Said the boy.

&quot;They call her Kaylee.&quot; Said the girl.

&quot;She's the key.&quot; They turned as one and looked at the men. &quot;She'll bring River
Tam to you.&quot;

***

Mal saw them walking into the bay and up the stairs. He thought it took
monumental control on his part not to start shouting then and there. His jaw
was set and he glared at them.

&quot;Doctor?&quot; He started.

&quot;I know, Captain, I know.&quot; Simon looked helpless. &quot;She must have done it
before.&quot;

&quot;River? This isn't cute anymore.&quot; He noticed that she was watching him, her
eyes scanning quickly. It made him uneasy. &quot;I want you fix it now.&quot;

She ignored his words and sifted through the eddy of his brain. Worry and fear
tainted all of it and it was mixed with everybody else. Zoe, Book and Jayne
standing behind Mal. Simon behind her. Fear for the others, fear of her. She
grew impatient. She closed her eyes and tried to focus, pushed through the
clouds and barriers. Then she found it in his head.

&quot;We're taking Serenity.&quot; She told him, slightly flushed with her success.
&quot;Shuttle's too small to carry all of us. More firepower. Quicker escape.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mal felt himself bristle. &quot;If they've got a lockdown on who Kaylee is,
then they'll be watching for us, we can't just coast right in.&quot;

He paused.

&quot;And I'm the Captain, I decide!&quot;

River took a breath, she ran the words through her head like a string of beads.
They had to come out right or this could all go wrong.

&quot;Then decide to do what I say.&quot; She held up a hand to stop his outburst. &quot;Inara
walked free, round the world, up and down. She waits. They don't want to stop
us. They want us in there.&quot;

Everybody was looking at her.

&quot;They want me.&quot;

The very worst part about it, Mal knew, was that she was right. Everything she
just said was true and there was no way to disagree with her without looking
like a stubborn old hun dan or completely jeopardizing their only chance to get
Wash and Kaylee back.

&quot;No. That's not it.&quot; Simon broke into the stand off. &quot;Captain? They can't have
linked Kaylee or Wash to River so soon. It's just a problem with the hospital,
right? The files didn't hold up, or...&quot;

&quot;She's right, Simon.&quot; Mal nodded towards River as he spoke. &quot;She obviously
knows, so I'll tell you. Inara just contacted us, she's been stone walled: from
her own client and from any contact with Kaylee. The people at her job say she
was never there, but Inara was able to move freely without being stopped.&quot;

&quot;That doesn't mean...&quot; Simon could feel himself shrink. &quot;How would they know
Inara and Kaylee...?&quot;

&quot;Long and complicated.&quot; Zoe told him. &quot;Essentially, if all's they had figured
was Wash and Kaylee's story didn't add up, because of their connection with
Inara, then they would have tagged Inara too.&quot;

&quot;But they didn't.&quot; Supplied Book. &quot;And they know Inara is connected to us. A
Firefly.&quot;

Simon put all the pieces together.

&quot;Ariel put a Firefly back on our warrant, didn't it?&quot; He didn't wait for an
answer. &quot;River, you can't go there. That's just what they want.&quot;

&quot;Simon.&quot; River turned to look at him, but he was watching Mal.

&quot;We'll stay here. We'll wait for you here. Or... or just River. Don't take her
with us. I'll go, I'll help, just not...&quot;

River looked at him sadly, she reached up and cupped his chin.

&quot;Our crew needs us. The tales tell us what to do.&quot; She waited until he looked
her in the eye. &quot;Orpheus walks into Hades. Mustn't hesitate. Can't look
back.&quot;

&quot;Zoe?&quot; Mal spoke softly. &quot;Get this ship in the air. Jayne? Disconnect the power
and water.&quot;

***

Kaylee rocked back and forth as she sat on the end of the bed, working the
edges of her fingernails between her teeth. She couldn't look at Wash, but
needed the feel of his legs against her hip. Her brain refused to think, she
had tried to come up with a plan, tried to think of some way out of this, but
all she had been able to do up to this point was cry.

She heard the snick of the door and looked up.

&quot;Kaylee Frye?&quot; She reacted to the name before she could stop herself. &quot;You are
hereby bound by law.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She whispered as she stood up and turned to the bed. &quot;Wash? Dammit, wake
up!&quot;

He looked at her and smiled dreamily.

&quot;It's okay, Katie. The doctor's going to help.&quot;

&quot;You've got the wrong person.&quot; It was almost begging, she could hear the plea
in her voice as she kept backing away. &quot;I don't know anything.&quot;

&quot;If you don't come with us voluntarily,&quot; One of them informed her calmly.
&quot;we'll have to sedate you.&quot;

&quot;No. Please?&quot; She whispered, but she already knew it was too late, she could
feel the terror freeze her innards. &quot;I haven't done anything... Wash? Help
me!&quot;

She felt them grab hold of her, felt the hypo at her neck as she struggled,
really struggled to break free. Her body stopped working. There was no slow
going under, just a quick snap and she was falling limp into their arms, unable
to move.

Oh god, was Kaylee's last coherent thought, they have blue hands.

***

&quot;There.&quot; River sat with her chin resting on her folded arms, her eyes scanned
the planetary layout as Book looked over her shoulder. Her hand stabbed at a
series of dots. &quot;Glendale Docks.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot; Mal was standing behind Zoe at the front console.

&quot;Looks solid.&quot; Book agreed. &quot;Large enough not to be noticed, far enough from
the hospital to provide cover.&quot;

&quot;If they let us land.&quot; Jayne stood to the side with Simon. &quot;Anyone else
expecting a welcome party?&quot;

River looked up at him.

&quot;Not good strategy. Draw us in. Catching flies with honey.&quot; She made a clacking
sound with her tongue as her eyes began to drift. &quot;Sticky sweet. Don't
struggle. Bees can sting.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well.&quot; He replied, nervous. &quot;It's the sting that worries me.&quot;

She rolled her eyes.

&quot;Bees have hive mentality. Be a bee.&quot; River suddenly looked amused at her own
words. &quot;Be a bee a bee. A bee.&quot;

Jayne scrunched up his face as he looked at Simon.

&quot;She wants me to act like a gorram insect?&quot;

Zoe saw Mal watching River with a thoughtful look on his face. She knew that
look, had seen it countless times before, his brain processing the data. He was
assessing a new recruit.

&quot;Sir?&quot; She didn't think she needed to ask, but did anyway. &quot;What are you
thinking?&quot;

&quot;She has a good military mind.&quot; He replied. &quot;Strategy wise.&quot;

&quot;You thinking of retiring?&quot;

&quot;Soon as I'm rich, Zoe.&quot;

&quot;So, not anytime soon, then?&quot;

&quot;Not in this lifetime.&quot; He patted her shoulder. &quot;Call Inara back, tell her
where to meet us.&quot;

&quot;Already on it, Sir.&quot; True to her word, she already had the speaker in her
hand. &quot;Inara? This is Serenity. We'll meet you at the Glendale docks in
approximately one hour.&quot;

&quot;You're bringing the whole ship?&quot; Came her incredulous voice. &quot;What happened to
laying low?&quot;

&quot;You know Mal.&quot; Zoe tried to smile, but somehow she was just too distracted.

&quot;I'm already half way to Bellaphron now.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mal burst in and grabbed the speaker from Zoe. &quot;I told you to stay put.&quot;

&quot;Relax.&quot; Zoe began flicking switches. &quot;Put her on autopilot, Inara, we'll lock
into your nav trajectory and pull you in.&quot;

&quot;Got scared.&quot; Pointed out River. &quot;Couldn't stay. Guilt and tears like ants.
Swarming over skin.&quot;

Yeah, well. Mal's stubborn mind wouldn't let it go. Nothing ever went simple,
something always had to go wrong. And why? Because no one on this rutting ship
ever did what they were told. They always hadda go deviating from the plan.
Everybody always wanted to save the day. They couldn't do anything quietly. And
they always got caught. And one of these days he was just gonna leave them
there.

River looked at him, amusement twitching the edges of her mouth, competing with
a good dose of anger.

&quot;Everybody wants to be a hero.&quot; She stepped up towards him and poked a finger
in his chest. &quot;You love making noise. More than they do. You should leave
yourself behind.&quot;

Zoe and Jayne gave matching snorts of agreement. Mal folded his arms in front
of him.

&quot;You stop that, you hear?&quot; He put on his most fearsome frown. &quot;Stop readin' my
mind. Gotta be some way to control it.&quot;

A look of desperation flew over her features, gone so quickly he wasn't even
sure it had been there. He heard Simon's voice from long ago explaining that
she couldn't. He felt like a heel.

&quot;Make more noise.&quot; She challenged him, as her hand rose up and wavered near her
ear, trembling. &quot;Make it louder. I want to stop it. *You* get out of *my*
head.&quot;

Mal watched her turn on her heels and walk over to Simon and Jayne. He got the
distinct impression he was to stay exactly where he was and not follow her. The
looks that Zoe and Book were giving him only made him feel worse.

***

His security card popped the lights from red to green and Dr. Williams punched
in his code to open the door. When he walked in the room, the man calling
himself Stephen Hoffman sat up, as much as he could, instantly more alert than
he had been all day.

&quot;Where did they take her?&quot; Stephen was looking at him as if he was going to
help. &quot;They took my Katie.&quot;

&quot;Now, now, Mr. Hoffman. The nurses told me you were getting agitated.&quot; He
looked pointedly at the restraints on the man's wrists. &quot;If you don't calm
down, we'll have to sedate you again.&quot;

&quot;Where is my wife?&quot; Came the question, bitten out of a clenched jaw as the
patient leant back against the bed.

Dr. Williams sat down, moving carefully and deliberately, on a chair next to
the bed.

&quot;We both know she's not your wife.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Stephen shook his head. &quot;What are you talking about? She was here,
before, you were talking to her! And the men... they took... they had a
hypo...&quot;

The doctor didn't react to his words.

&quot;I'm reminded of an old fable. I'm sure you know it. There are two men... Well,
let's just say a man and a woman, shall we? It seems to fit. Anyway, to get
past them you need to solve a riddle. You see, one of them always lies and the
other always tells the truth.&quot;

He examined the cuticles of his fingers.

&quot;Now, considering you seem to be exactly who you claim to be, where does that
leave this so called loving wife of yours?&quot;

&quot;I don't know what you're...&quot;

&quot;No, I don't suppose you do.&quot; The doctor raised his eyes and delivered his next
words with cold clarity. &quot;You know, Mr. Hoffman, it takes a very cruel,
heartless, manipulative type of person to latch onto a helpless, mentally
unstable man and use him to fund an interplanetary drug ring. Don't you
think?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Stephen blinked slowly, trying to follow the words. &quot;Katie? No...&quot;

&quot;Face it. She lied to you. She lied to us all. And now she's left you high and
dry, to fend for yourself. Alone. In here.&quot;

Stephen let his eyes wander over the stark walls and felt them close in. In his
head he saw his life span out, it made sense, his relationship with his wife.
Yet, he couldn't bring it to the surface, couldn't articulate the vague threads
of his memory with specific details. A date, a place, a time, anything, but
nothing asserted itself.

&quot;No.&quot; He insisted. &quot;They took her... those men...&quot;

&quot;I'd be very careful,&quot; Pointed out the doctor as he stood up. &quot;who you told
about that little fantasy, given your history of paranoid delusions. Wouldn't
want anyone to get the wrong idea.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

***

She hesitated at the door, not entirely sure of the reception she would get.
Inara had known she'd been taking a risk, but she had thought the main risk was
for her and she hadn't expected everything to collapse so spectacularly so
soon. Taking a deep breath, she stepped onto the bridge, eerily reminded of two
nights previous.

&quot;What are the plans?&quot; She gathered her shawl more closely around her, as if it
could offer her protection. &quot;If any?&quot;

Tracking Mal's expressions was easy, she already knew the way his eyes assessed
her in an instant, the relief on his face quickly followed by more than a hint
of anger and tension that made him grit his teeth. It was Zoe she couldn't
read, the tight face and a nod of greeting, but no smile. Inara wished the
woman would just yell at her, get angry, do something.

&quot;No plans as yet.&quot; Mal's voice was tight. &quot;Figured you'd know more about the
place than any of us.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; She began.

&quot;Not now.&quot; Was all he said and it hurt.

Small hands, soft and gentle, turned her around and Inara found herself face to
face with River. Brown eyes scanned her face, up and down, left to right. She
stood still, unsure, the silence of the room unnerved her.

&quot;He doesn't like betrayal.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She clutched her arms tight to her body. &quot;He really doesn't.&quot;

&quot;You both lied to him.&quot; River met her eyes. &quot;Now Kaylee pays the price.&quot;

&quot;River? I...&quot;

Inara raised her hand, she wanted to touch the girl's hair, or cheek, make some
gesture to show how sorry she was. She could still hear herself promising to
watch Kaylee for River. Before she made contact, River turned to Mal and left
her standing alone with her hand in mid air.

&quot;We split up. You, Zoe and Inara to the house.&quot; River turned to the doorway
without waiting for an answer. &quot;Jayne's with me.&quot;

&quot;Uh?&quot; Jayne raised his hand. &quot;Can we, maybe, vote on this?&quot;

&quot;Don't ask me.&quot; Mal shrugged as he leaned against the chair. &quot;I'm just the
Captain around here.&quot;

&quot;Wait.&quot; Simon stepped forward. &quot;What do I do?&quot;

&quot;Stay hidden.&quot;

River and Mal spoke at the same time, earning looks from everyone. It looked as
if Mal was about to say something, but he stopped himself.

&quot;Zoe?&quot; Jayne asked. &quot;You wanna swap?&quot;

She just shook her head and Jayne made his eyes real big.

&quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;I'll be good.&quot; River curtsied in front of him. &quot;If you are.&quot;

Mal found her sitting on the couches outside the infirmary, waiting for the
rest of them, he assumed. It wasn't hard to see the misery radiating from her
as her arms hugged themselves close to her body and she looked off to the side.
She'd distanced herself from all of them since she'd been back and now that
they'd landed it was no different. He had to stop himself from melting down
next to her and putting an arm around her shoulders.

&quot;What were you thinking?&quot; He forced an edge to his voice.

&quot;Mal!&quot; Inara looked up.

&quot;Where you even thinking at all?&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; She stood and faced him. &quot;It was foolish...&quot;

&quot;Foolish?&quot; He didn't need to force the anger anymore. &quot;It was downright stupid,
Inara. That plan was near fool proof. There was no way to connect them to us,
not a one! And you had to go and... and... keep tabs on their doctor.&quot;

He had to pause to breathe properly.

&quot;When I found out you contracted with a man with a red mark against his name!
I...&quot; His mistake, he'd realize when he looked back, was missing the narrowing
of her eyes, the way her face began to close off. &quot;... god, Inara, I didn't
know what to think!&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry?&quot; Her brows arched and she stepped forward, gathering herself up,
and it made him take a step back. &quot;When you what? You've been checking up on
me? How dare you?&quot;

There was no way out of this with dignity or grace. He knew it. There was
absolutely no way he could deny what he'd just revealed.

&quot;And with good reason!&quot; He blustered. &quot;Not only did you risk the whole
operation, you put yourself in danger as well.&quot;

&quot;I'm a grown woman, Mal.&quot; She looked him in the eye. &quot;I can look after myself.&quot;

&quot;Not with that...&quot; He stopped and took a breath. They weren't going to get
anywhere with yelling and it wasn't why he'd come to talk to her in the first
place. &quot;That sort of client is beneath you, Inara, and you know it.&quot;

She swallowed. He always knew how to do that. Build her up to the point where
she was ready to explode or slap him. Or both. Then he'd just step back and say
something that smoothed it all away. It was one of the more frustrating things
about him.

&quot;I had to do something.&quot; The flash of anger had left her and she was back to
pleading for understanding. &quot;When I saw him on the tender... I knew I could
keep an extra eye on them. But Mal?&quot;

Dear lord, she was about to cry, he could tell. He placed a hand on her
shoulder.

&quot;If anything happens to them.&quot; She whispered as she brought her hand up to
cover his. &quot;To Kaylee. Or Wash. I'll never forgive myself. I'll...&quot;

&quot;You meant well.&quot; He had to remove his hand, just had to. &quot;Ain't one of us on
this ship don't regret doing something that started with meaning well. Just
proves you're human is all.&quot;

&quot;That doesn't help, though, does it?&quot; She insisted. &quot;River was right. I messed
up and Kaylee's going to pay.&quot;

&quot;I reckon you're forgetting our secret weapon.&quot;

&quot;Our secret what?&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;What could we possibly have that they
don't?&quot;

&quot;River.&quot; He said simply.

&quot;Are you...?&quot; Back from the edge of tears, she hit disbelief again. &quot;Mal? You
can't be serious.&quot;

&quot;By her own admission, this is what she was trained for.&quot; He gave a nod of
approval. &quot;Not that I'd say it, mind you, but she's doing pretty well so
far.&quot;

&quot;Doing what?&quot; She asked. &quot;Besides annoying you by giving orders?&quot;

&quot;By making my decisions for me. Better than I can and before I can.&quot; His voice
took on a note she recognized. He was set in his ways over this. &quot;I ain't seen
her half as coherent before this as she is now. I don't think she's anywhere
near finished, either, if you want to know the truth.&quot;

Inara thought about this for a moment.

&quot;You really believe in her, don't you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; He admitted. &quot;And she knows it, Uppity Little Minx.&quot;

She let herself smile a little.

&quot;Thank you, Mal.&quot;

He narrowed his eyes.

&quot;I ain't finished with you, yet.&quot;
