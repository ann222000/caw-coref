This is toooooo funny!  This world is getting more complicated
every day (or, should I say, "technologically advanced")  Wondering whether
this would allow the "Big Brother" to "monitor" our "Movements".....
Just a thought!

Too funny, Kathy! LOL! And I was just commenting this morning that
teachers the world over are grateful that today is a Sunday and that
they won't have to put up with "stuff" in class. ;)

That reminds me of the wonderful "poissons d'avril" the news broadcast did
when I lived in France. The whole news show was fake news stories. My
favorite was about the farmer who was suing the government over the TGV (the
French high-speed train that had just started). He claimed his cows were so
fascinated by the train that they wouldn't graze anymore, but just stood
looking down the tracks all day, waiting for the next train to whizz by.
*grin*

(And why on earth do they call it "fish of April"???)

I can't answer your last question definitively, Kathy, but I *suspect*
(and this is my own hypothesis only) that it's related to a phrase I've
heard here, too. Have you ever heard someone who is particularly naïve
or gullible called a fish?

At any rate, when I was a French teacher (I never lived in France), I
used to have my advanced and intermediate students make little
construction-paper fish shapes and write "poisson d'avril" on them. Then
I gave each a list of names of my beginning students. The object was to
stick a fish on the beginning students without being caught, and then
the beginner and the "sticker" each got a few extra points for getting
into the spirit of the thing. ;) It also served to keep more
"aggressive" tricks at bay. &lt;G&gt;

I got home from work yesterday, grateful that none of my employees had
pulled any tricks. Then the phone rang, and it was my top employee telling
me he was down at the store, the alarm was going off, the police were there,
and that someone had broken the plate glass windows in the front. Man, did
he get me good!
