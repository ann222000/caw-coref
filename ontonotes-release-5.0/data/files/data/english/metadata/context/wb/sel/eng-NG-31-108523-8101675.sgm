Kangerlussuaq, Greenland -- A slab of pale blue ice the size of a
semitrailer broke off the side of the Russell Glacier and splashed
into a rushing stream of meltwater some 100 feet below.

The thunderous sound of splintering ice was frightening enough,
especially after hearing a guide describe how a huge chunk of
plummeting glacier killed several tourists and injured dozens near
here with its icy shrapnel in the 1970s.

But the truly scary part was that we had witnessed another ominous
reminder that the ice sheet of Greenland is melting twice as fast as
it was just 10 years ago. The vast ice cap is up to 2 miles thick and
covers 80 percent of the world's largest island, which is three times
the size of Texas.

&quot;The glaciers are disappearing and a lot of people say they want to
see the Greenland ice sheet before it's gone,&quot; said Kim Peterson, a
Danish glacier tour guide based here. He's watched the same section of
the Russell Glacier at the end of the Sonde Stromfjord gradually melt
over the past 22 years.

Peterson is keenly aware of a cruel irony: a recent spike in tourism
may portend the beginning of the end for an ancient way of life among
56,000 Greenlandic people scattered across the treeless and harsh
landscape. Inuit hunters, who rely on cold ocean temperatures and
extensive winter sea ice to stalk seals, whales and polar bears, may
soon come up empty-handed.

The Greenland ice sheet, second only to Antarctica in the volume of
water locked in its deep freeze, has been a barometer for researchers
measuring the effect of the world's growing consumption of coal, oil
and gas on heating up the planet.

What their instruments have confirmed is that the news out of
Greenland is bad -- and getting worse.

The National Science Foundation is funding a record number of research
projects in Greenland, with roughly 30 studies under way as part of
NSF's $400 million annual budget for polar research.

Climate change and global warming caused in part by increased
emissions from vehicles and industry are no longer open to debate, as
it had been somewhat in 1985, the last time a Times Union team visited
Greenland with the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing.

&quot;There is broad consensus now that global warming is very real and
that it's accelerating,&quot; said Greg Huey, professor of atmospheric
chemistry at Georgia Institute of Technology who completed two months
of field work last week, his third trip to Greenland.

Huey is investigating high levels of NOx -- the same stew of nitrogen
oxide gases found in urban smog from New York City to Los Angeles --
that form near the snow's surface on sunny days across the Greenland
ice cap.

&quot;We've measured much more NOx than anyone would have believed just a
few years ago,&quot; Huey said. &quot;It's less than you'd find in rush-hour
Atlanta traffic on a summer day, but it's still alarming.&quot;

It's important to put the rise in temperatures and rates of glacial
melt in Greenland in context over millions of years of geologic time,
said Simon Stephenson, director of NSF's office of polar programs.

MR Sir Jean-Paul Turcaud,
it will take more than 350 years of upheating BEFORE the Ice over Greenland
melted to the stage it was during the period late 9th century up to late
14th century!
Reality is more obvious if and only if you go for correct information which
in the Greenland case you can find from excavations of more than 300 farms
some of which still have problems with permafrost close by but who had so
much better weather during the Norse Greenlanders' 500 year long settlement
that those farms EXPORTED (!) butter (in saltwater) and hard cheese to
EUROPE!
Good Night MR SIR Jean-Paul until you start from reality and forgets your
theories!

Dear Ms Inger,

You have brought that point forth previously and you seem not
concerned nor aware of the extremely grave situation. Further still I
take it that you are defending the Glaciations theories  ( and hence
Paleo Glacial Climate ) + of course you must be seeing everywhere
those wondrous fjords dug up by Glaciers ? Correct !
In this you are indeed completely deluded and so you are not
understanding likewise the causes of previous  Greenland warming
( this gave Eric the Red incidentally the chance to discover America.

This is your prerogative indeed to join the camp of the Global Warming
deniers ...and you are not going to be alone indeed. Unfortunately
wishful thinking conducts often to disillusion.

With kind regards   jpturcaud

Although my agreeing with Inger heralds the true dawning of the Age of
Aquarius, the fact is the melting glaciers are leaving behind sign of human
habitation in the form of farm houses and barns. The same thing is happening in
the Alps.

How can it be a problem for things to return to where they were centuries ago?

Is it possible there is anything about which are you not a retard?

They will not, Matt, simply because the drift of Earth on Ecliptic is
irreversible,  as proof the continous Eafth Expansion manifested by
what some ignorant &amp; dull minds see as PT evolution..

Your problem is not that you are reasoning wrongly, as well as the
others, on the contrary you are highly intelligent as your rethoric
clearly demonstrates  ( and so is Inger incidentally) , your problem
is that you have NOT the correct premises to reason from. There are
many levels of conscience and people are not equal indeed, although
they give the impression to be on the same footing.

In all cases there is always a pioneer or a leader who paves the way
for others to follow, who then extrapolate from correct definitiions.
The True Geology is something completely different from what has been
known for centuries, and its understanding can be reached by ordinary
scientists,  only however once a superior mind has open its vision in
all its coherence with other disciplines.

Knowledge is not compartimented indeed, it is whole &amp; Universal. This
is why the present analytical approach is failing  miserably in
understanding the past &amp; present as well as antiicpating the future.

Matt,
I may have been wrong about your stance on the melting ice below.
If so, I aplogize, and you know I rarely do (I know, manners and
things.)  But the orginial target was always Iran.  Nobody cared about
Afganistan or Iraq.  They are dust bowls, Iran was always the target.
Look at a map! We had them surrounded!!! We got bogged down in Iraq
and you and I both know the mess there. Now Iran may have to wait for
the next President.  But, Hillary has big brass balls, so I'm not
worried. (Pardon the language.)   K.W.

Turcaud,
May I remind you that if you are taught in school all your life that
Australia is populated by criminals, unless evidence is presented in a
light other than the mindset you chose to enlighten us above on
Greenland this becomes the general belief. Your method of educating us
&quot;degenerates&quot; will be taken as insulting, even if true or untrue.  So
while I do not generally use profanity on this site as a rule.  Kiss

The relatively brief history of computer models used on climate is
that they never seem to have enuf of the relevant data. I dont have a
model for the future of Greenland, or anwhere else, I'd care to
defend.

The example of the Greenland Norse, outlined fairly well in &quot;Collapse&quot;
the latest by Diamond, is consistent with a pattern seen very many
times in history, where the power elites, when confronted with a
decline in resources and the failure to adapt to new opportunies,
actually *increases* their exploitation of all lower classes so as to
continue the illusion of &quot;progress&quot;.

We see the increasing cost of management, and the decreasing ability
of the lowest classes to merely survive in most parts of the
undeveloped world, and I dont think we need a computer model to see
that this will continue.

Regarding Greenland, I read of an effort to import Yak. That makes
eminent sense based on the little we do know about the rate of glacial
shrinkage. But whether today's Greenlanders will be socially adaptable
enuf to take advantage of this remains in doubt.

That was my whole point, other than my joke.  Greenland was certainly
never &quot;Greenland&quot;.  Before the little ice age, the ice had melted
enough to try and start a colony on it.  As it became colder, and the

I've read that the ice cores go back 110 to maybe 118,000 years,
depending on where you drill. Of more concern is the record of
dramatic rapid swings from cold to warm, sometimes taking only a
single decade, but commonly done within a few. The ice cores show that
global warming has been going on for 10,000 years, so I doubt there's
anything we can do to stop it, altho I can see how hominid activity
may have accellerated it.

The lesson Diamond makes of the Greenland Norse, is that while the
climate changed, they could have *adapted* to it by adopting some
Inuit hunting techniques, but they were too racist to do that.

Has anyone ever mentioned that the eastern part of the antartica ice
pack holds 80% of the world's fresh water?  If it were to heat up to
68 degrees F. there, it would take between 10,000-12,000 years to
melt?  As of today the temperature there is a balmy -40 degrees F.  If
all of Greenland's ice melts, the total rise in the Oceans would be a
whole 14 inches?  20 ft has been banded about, but all the weather
models show 14 inches.  Anyone see anything wrong with Al Gore's
thinking besides he desperately wants to be a hero at something?  K.W.

Volume  = height * area.
Area of Antarctica (never mind Greenland) ~= 14 Million SQ KM
Mean height of ice above land, 2-3 km.
Volume ~= 30,000,000 - 40,000,000 cubic km.

Radius of Earth ~= 6400 km
Surface area of a sphere = 4 pi r^2
4 * 22/7 * 64 * 64 * 10,000 ~= 500,000,000 sq km
70% water so  360,000,000 sq km of ocean

40/360 ~= 0.1 km

If Antarctica melted the total rise in the oceans would be about
300 feet.
Not surprisingly, all of Florida would 200 feet under water.

And there isn't a darned thing anyone can do about it,
Mankind can't even control his bladder or sexual urges,
let alone control Earth's precession or perihelion.

If sea level rises a foot it will be a disaster, my only daughter lives on
the shoreline and will have to move. Come to think of it that might not
be so bad, there are disaster relief funds.
If sea level rises 20 feet London and New York and other coastal
cities around the world from Sydney to Hong Kong to San Francisco
will go under and it will be a statistic. There are no statistic relief
funds.
If Florida is under a foot of water it doesn't matter if its under 100 feet
instead, it is under.

Yes, that gives the height.

No problem. It would greatly improve newsreaders if colour coding
were employed rather than 1970's indenting, and/or the abbreviated name
of the author at the start of every line. After all, URLs appear in  blue...
oh well.

Perhaps I should have said &quot;That gives the depth&quot; :-)

: Sorry, but I'm an agnostic, but I live in the belt buckle of the bible
: states. And don't call me &quot;yank.&quot;  In Oklahoma that is like calling you a
bastard.

&quot;Yank&quot; is a generic term used by the British for colonial settlers and
their offspring who rebelled against the crown, it does not apply to the
displaced indigenous peoples of Oklahoma by the genocidal mass
murderer Andrew Jackson (still hypocritically honoured on currency)
that yanks misappropriately call &quot;indians&quot;.
Southern yanks are also known for their hatred of &quot;niggers&quot;, the
descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to northern
yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should not
take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any better
and those like me who do will continue to use the term.
You can call me anything you like, but don't call me late for my
dinner.

: That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
: have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
: question.

To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline pilot
on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x height
and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.

: all the economic opportunities it creates.  New towns, homes,
: buildings, a economic boom perhaps.  You have to look at the bright
: side of things, 'cause we aren't going to stop it.  Sorry about the
: wanker husband.

I'm neither pessimist nor optimist, I'm a realist, and anyway I'll
be dead before it happens.  When Katrina flooded New Orleans,

was that a good thing resulting in an economic boom or a bad
thing resulting in hundreds of deaths? Nature is neither good nor
evil, Nature just IS and man does not control her. We adapt
to Nature, she does not adapt to us. Wishful thinking serves
no purpose.

: No ideas there. Please remember, we may all be
: Americans, but we aren't all &quot;Yanks&quot;.

I don't call the Portuguese speaking peoples of Brazil or the
Spanish speaking people of Argentina and Mexico or even the
French and English speaking peoples of Canada yanks, I call
them all Americans. &quot;Yank&quot; refers to USA dwellers of European
origin. As I said earlier, it is not derogatory.

: If you don't know the name Al
: Gore, please, don't bother, you might have a heart attack.  Regards,
: K.W.

He'll be quickly forgotten come the next election. Yanks are
notorious for electing bad leadership and then replacing it with
more bad leadership. But then, under the skin, people are all
the same everywhere. Ian Fleming used a title for one of his
James Bond series, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. That about sums up
humanity. When my daughter died  (of cancer) a year ago there
was nothing I could do about it. Had there been I'd have done
it and I'd have willingly died myself if it would have saved her.
What parent wouldn't?

But anyway, the fundamental cause of global &quot;warming&quot; (and cooling)
is the Sun and Earth's relation to it.
Climate change is caused by a combination of many things,
but the ultimate driving force is the plain old inverse square
law, the precession of Earth's tilt and the eccentricity of the
Earth's orbit.

Once each year Earth is closest to the sun (91,000,000 miles)
and six months later it is furthest from the sun (94,000,000 miles)
and at the moment Earth's great white spot (Antarctica) tilts
toward the sun when we are closest to the sun.
In about 11,000 to 13,000 years the great white spot will be
tilted toward the Sun when Earth is furthest from the Sun.
This will increase the size of the great white spot, it will radiate
more heat back into space, the planet will cool and another
Ice Age will be the result.

Life has been maintained on this planet for millions of years
as the fossil record shows, so Earth's climate has to have been
fairly stable for all of that time, temperatures rising and falling
by a few degrees only. Man's extreme sensitivity to variations
in temperature, something we share with all warm-blooded
mammals, is making him nervous, but he's a very adaptable
animal who'll clad himself in seal-skin and animal furs when
cold and sleep naked under the stars in Borneo when warm.
Let the ice melt in Greenland, we'll just go and live there,
that's all. It's as big as half of Europe anyway.

I wouldnt look for that, but did read of an effort to import Yak for
the pastures.

The Greenland ice cores show many rapid climate shifts, often in a few
decades, but some within just a single decade. And they also show that
global warming has been going on for 10,000 years; trying to sort out
how much that is being accellerated by the current hominids is not
possible.

In any event, stopping it seems impossible. And given the conventional
lack of wisdom, some doubt about the ability of hominids to adapt to
the changes. Which is something we've seen several times in hominid
history, and which made Jared Diamond a fair amount of money on his
latest book, &quot;Collapse&quot;.

I spoze we may see Florida, Bangladesh, New Orleans, and other such
areas become uninhabitable. but there will likewise be opportunities
in joining the Greenland Cattleman's association, and they're already
growing grains and potatoes in the Yukon &amp; Siberia. As the permafrost
melts, there could actually be a net gain in farmland over that which
is lost to flooding.

I note as well that monsoonal rains now reach up into my neck of Ozark
woods. The moderation is remarkable; I have yet to see really hot
humid weather, and expect moderate conditions to last well into the
fall. I've already begun ramping up production for a fall garden that
will be very rewarding if the frost is as late as I expect. I cut a
lot of my own wood, but if I had to buy it, would be able to heat the
house thru the entire winter on 100$ because the winter temps are so
much more moderate- as a result of global warming.

That kind of thing could also cut petroleum consumption. Archeology
has spent a lotta time looking at fireplaces, but it mite be worth
calculating the amount of fuel consumed in different eras compared to
the weather record. I have read reports of weather changes in the 5th
century that had a lot to do with the fall of Rome. The lesson of
history is abundant with examples of leadership that failed to
recognize the changes and adapt. Weather has always changed, and the
forecasts by the USDA rank right up there with necromancy.

&gt; : &gt; instead, it is under.
&gt; : &gt; Mother Nature doesn't give a damn but you could always try praying

&gt; :
&gt; : Sorry, but I'm an agnostic, but I live in the belt buckle of the bible
&gt; : states. And don't call me &quot;yank.&quot;  In Oklahoma that is like calling you a
&gt; bastard.

&gt; &quot;Yank&quot; is a generic term used by the British for colonial settlers and
&gt; their offspring who rebelled against the crown, it does not apply to the
&gt; displaced indigenous peoples of Oklahoma by the genocidal mass
&gt; murderer Andrew Jackson (still hypocritically honoured on currency)
&gt; that yanks misappropriately call &quot;indians&quot;.
&gt; Southern yanks are also known for their hatred of &quot;niggers&quot;, the
&gt; descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
&gt; the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
&gt; I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to northern
&gt; yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
&gt; north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should not
&gt; take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any better
&gt; and those like me who do will continue to use the term.
&gt; You can call me anything you like, but don't call me late for my
&gt; dinner.

&gt; : That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
&gt; : have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
&gt; : question.

&gt; To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline pilot
&gt; on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x height
&gt; and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
&gt; plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
&gt; Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.

&gt; : But, if the sea rises, people have to move inland, think of
&gt; : all the economic opportunities it creates.  New towns, homes,
&gt; : buildings, a economic boom perhaps.  You have to look at the bright
&gt; : side of things, 'cause we aren't going to stop it.  Sorry about the
&gt; : wanker husband.

&gt; I'm neither pessimist nor optimist, I'm a realist, and anyway I'll
&gt; be dead before it happens.  When Katrina flooded New Orleans,

&gt; was that a good thing resulting in an economic boom or a bad
&gt; thing resulting in hundreds of deaths? Nature is neither good nor
&gt; evil, Nature just IS and man does not control her. We adapt
&gt; to Nature, she does not adapt to us. Wishful thinking serves
&gt; no purpose.

&gt; : No ideas there. Please remember, we may all be
&gt; : Americans, but we aren't all &quot;Yanks&quot;.

&gt; I don't call the Portuguese speaking peoples of Brazil or the
&gt; Spanish speaking people of Argentina and Mexico or even the
&gt; French and English speaking peoples of Canada yanks, I call
&gt; them all Americans. &quot;Yank&quot; refers to USA dwellers of European
&gt; origin. As I said earlier, it is not derogatory.

&gt; : If you don't know the name Al
&gt; : Gore, please, don't bother, you might have a heart attack.  Regards,
&gt; : K.W.

&gt; He'll be quickly forgotten come the next election. Yanks are
&gt; notorious for electing bad leadership and then replacing it with
&gt; more bad leadership. But then, under the skin, people are all
&gt; the same everywhere. Ian Fleming used a title for one of his
&gt; James Bond series, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. That about sums up
&gt; humanity. When my daughter died  (of cancer) a year ago there
&gt; was nothing I could do about it. Had there been I'd have done
&gt; it and I'd have willingly died myself if it would have saved her.
&gt; What parent wouldn't?

&gt; But anyway, the fundamental cause of global &quot;warming&quot; (and cooling)
&gt; is the Sun and Earth's relation to it.
&gt; Climate change is caused by a combination of many things,
&gt; but the ultimate driving force is the plain old inverse square
&gt; law, the precession of Earth's tilt and the eccentricity of the
&gt; Earth's orbit.

&gt; Once each year Earth is closest to the sun (91,000,000 miles)
&gt; and six months later it is furthest from the sun (94,000,000 miles)
&gt; and at the moment Earth's great white spot (Antarctica) tilts
&gt; toward the sun when we are closest to the sun.
&gt; In about 11,000 to 13,000 years the great white spot will be
&gt; tilted toward the Sun when Earth is furthest from the Sun.
&gt; This will increase the size of the great white spot, it will radiate
&gt; more heat back into space, the planet will cool and another
&gt; Ice Age will be the result.

&gt; Life has been maintained on this planet for millions of years
&gt; as the fossil record shows, so Earth's climate has to have been
&gt; fairly stable for all of that time, temperatures rising and falling
&gt; by a few degrees only. Man's extreme sensitivity to variations
&gt; in temperature, something we share

: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Area of Antarctica (never mind Greenland) ~= 14 Million SQ KM
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Mean height of ice above land, 2-3 km.
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Volume ~= 30,000,000 - 40,000,000 cubic km.
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Radius of Earth ~= 6400 km
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Surface area of a sphere = 4 pi r^2

: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; 40/360 ~= 0.1 km
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;

: &gt; : &gt; If sea level rises 20 feet London and New York and other coastal
: &gt; : &gt; cities around the world from Sydney to Hong Kong to San Francisco
: &gt; : &gt; will go under and it will be a statistic. There are no statistic
relief
: &gt; : &gt; funds.
: &gt; : &gt; If Florida is under a foot of water it doesn't matter if its under
100
: &gt; feet
: &gt; : &gt; instead, it is under.
: &gt; : &gt; Mother Nature doesn't give a damn but you could always try praying

: &gt; :
: &gt; : Sorry, but I'm an agnostic, but I live in the belt buckle of the bible
: &gt; : states. And don't call me &quot;yank.&quot;  In Oklahoma that is like calling
you a
: &gt; bastard.
: &gt;
: &gt; &quot;Yank&quot; is a generic term used by the British for colonial settlers and
: &gt; their offspring who rebelled against the crown, it does not apply to the
: &gt; displaced indigenous peoples of Oklahoma by the genocidal mass
: &gt; murderer Andrew Jackson (still hypocritically honoured on currency)
: &gt; that yanks misappropriately call &quot;indians&quot;.
: &gt; Southern yanks are also known for their hatred of &quot;niggers&quot;, the
: &gt; descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
: &gt; the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
: &gt; I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to northern
: &gt; yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
: &gt; north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should not
: &gt; take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any better
: &gt; and those like me who do will continue to use the term.
: &gt; You can call me anything you like, but don't call me late for my
: &gt; dinner.
: &gt;
: &gt; : That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
: &gt; : have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
: &gt; : question.
: &gt;
: &gt; To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline pilot
: &gt; on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x height
: &gt; and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
: &gt; plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
: &gt; Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.
: &gt;
: &gt; : But, if the sea rises, people have to move inland, think of
: &gt; : all the economic opportunities it creates.  New towns, homes,
: &gt; : buildings, a economic boom perhaps.  You have to look at the bright
: &gt; : side of things, 'cause we aren't going to stop it.  Sorry about the
: &gt; : wanker husband.
: &gt;
: &gt; I'm neither pessimist nor optimist, I'm a realist, and anyway I'll
: &gt; be dead before it happens.  When Katrina flooded New Orleans,
: &gt;
: &gt; was that a good thing resulting in an economic boom or a bad
: &gt; thing resulting in hundreds of deaths? Nature is neither good nor
: &gt; evil, Nature just IS and man does not control her. We adapt
: &gt; to Nature, she does not adapt to us. Wishful thinking serves
: &gt; no purpose.
: &gt;
: &gt; : No ideas there. Please remember, we may all be
: &gt; : Americans, but we aren't all &quot;Yanks&quot;.
: &gt;
: &gt; I don't call the Portuguese speaking peoples of Brazil or the
: &gt; Spanish speaking people of Argentina and Mexico or even the
: &gt; French and English speaking peoples of Canada yanks, I call
: &gt; them all Americans. &quot;Yank&quot; refers to USA dwellers of European
: &gt; origin. As I said earlier, it is not derogatory.
: &gt;
: &gt; : If you don't know the name Al
: &gt; : Gore, please, don't bother, you might have a heart attack.  Regards,
: &gt; : K.W.
: &gt;
: &gt; He'll be quickly forgotten come the next election. Yanks are
: &gt; notorious for electing bad leadership and then replacing it with
: &gt; more bad leadership. But then, under the skin, people are all
: &gt; the same everywhere. Ian Fleming used a title for one of his
: &gt; James Bond series, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. That about sums up
: &gt; humanity. When my daughter died  (of cancer) a year ago there
: &gt; was nothing I could do about it. Had there been I'd have done
: &gt; it and I'd have willingly died myself if it would have saved her.
: &gt; What parent wouldn't?
: &gt;
: &gt; But anyway, the fundamental cause of global &quot;warming&quot; (and cooling)
: &gt; is the Sun and Earth's relation to it.
: &gt; Climate change is caused by a combination of many things,
: &gt; but the ultimate driving force is the plain old inverse square
: &gt; law, the precession of Earth's tilt and the eccentricity of the
: &gt; Earth's orbit.
: &gt;
: &gt; Once each year Earth is closest to the sun (91,000,000 miles)
: &gt; and six months later it is furthest from the sun (94,000,000 miles)
: &gt; and at the moment Earth's great white spot (Antarctica) tilts
: &gt; toward the sun when we are closest to the sun.

&gt; : &gt; descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
&gt; : &gt; the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
&gt; : &gt; I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to northern
&gt; : &gt; yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
&gt; : &gt; north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should
&gt; not
&gt; : &gt; take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any better
&gt; : &gt; and those like me who do will continue to use the term.

&gt; : &gt; : That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
&gt; : &gt; : have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
&gt; : &gt; : question.
&gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline pilot
&gt; : &gt; on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x
&gt; height
&gt; : &gt; and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
&gt; : &gt; plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
&gt; : &gt; Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Mankind can't even control his bladder or sexual urges,

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; As hahahanson says, it's a beautiful choir, let 'em sing.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; :

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; wankers or something?

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; If sea level rises a foot it will be a disaster, my only daughter
&gt; &gt; lives
&gt; &gt; : &gt; on

&gt; &gt; might

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; will go under and it will be a statistic. There are no statistic
&gt; &gt; relief
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; funds.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; If Florida is under a foot of water it doesn't matter if its under
&gt; &gt; 100
&gt; &gt; : &gt; feet
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; instead, it is under.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Mother Nature doesn't give a damn but you could always try praying
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; to her divorced and useless wanker of a husband, Gawd. Yanks
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; love their Gawd.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; :
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : Sorry, but I'm an agnostic, but I live in the belt buckle of the
&gt; &gt; bible
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : states. And don't call me &quot;yank.&quot;  In Oklahoma that is like calling
&gt; &gt; you a
&gt; &gt; : &gt; bastard.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; &quot;Yank&quot; is a generic term used by the British for colonial settlers and
&gt; &gt; : &gt; their offspring who rebelled against the crown, it does not apply to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; displaced indigenous peoples of Oklahoma by the genocidal mass
&gt; &gt; : &gt; murderer Andrew Jackson (still hypocritically honoured on currency)
&gt; &gt; : &gt; that yanks misappropriately call &quot;indians&quot;.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Southern yanks are also known for their hatred of &quot;niggers&quot;, the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
&gt; &gt; : &gt; the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to northern
&gt; &gt; : &gt; yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
&gt; &gt; : &gt; north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; : &gt; take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any better
&gt; &gt; : &gt; and those like me who do will continue to use the term.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; You can call me anything you like, but don't call me late for my
&gt; &gt; : &gt; dinner.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : question.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline pilot
&gt; &gt; : &gt; on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x
&gt; &gt; height
&gt; &gt; : &gt; and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
&gt; &gt; : &gt; plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : But, if the sea rises, people have to move inland, think of
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : all the economic opportunities it creates.  New towns, homes,
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : buildings, a economic boom perhaps.  You have to look at the bright
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : side of things, 'cause we aren't going to stop it.  Sorry about the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : wanker husband.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I'm neither pessimist nor optimist, I'm a realist, and anyway I'll
&gt; &gt; : &gt; be dead before it happens.  When Katrina flooded New Orleans,
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; was that a good thing resulting in an economic boom or a bad
&gt; &gt; : &gt; thing resulting in hundreds of deaths? Nature is neither good nor
&gt; &gt; : &gt; evil, Nature just IS and man does not control her. We adapt
&gt; &gt; : &gt; to Nature, she does not adapt to us. Wishful thinking serves
&gt; &gt; : &gt; no purpose.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : No ideas there. Please remember, we may all be
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : Americans, but we aren't all &quot;Yanks&quot;.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I don't call the Portuguese speaking peoples of Brazil or the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Spanish speaking people of Argentina and Mexico or even the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; French and English speaking peoples of Canada yanks, I call
&gt; &gt; : &gt; them all Americans. &quot;Yank&quot; refers to USA dwellers of European
&gt; &gt; : &gt; origin. As I said earlier, it is not derogatory.

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;

&gt; &gt; Al

&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; wankers or something?
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; If sea level rises a foot it will be a disaster, my only
&gt; &gt; daughter
&gt; &gt; lives
&gt; &gt; : &gt; on
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; the shoreline and will have to move. Come to think of it that
&gt; &gt; might
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; be so bad, there are disaster relief funds.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; If sea level rises 20 feet London and New York and other coastal
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; cities around the world from Sydney to Hong Kong to San
&gt; &gt; Francisco
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; will go under and it will be a statistic. There are no statistic
&gt; &gt; relief
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; funds.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; If Florida is under a foot of water it doesn't matter if its
&gt; &gt; under
&gt; &gt; 100
&gt; &gt; : &gt; feet
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; instead, it is under.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Mother Nature doesn't give a damn but you could always try
&gt; &gt; praying
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; to her divorced and useless wanker of a husband, Gawd. Yanks
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : &gt; love their Gawd.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; :
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : Sorry, but I'm an agnostic, but I live in the belt buckle of the
&gt; &gt; bible
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : states. And don't call me &quot;yank.&quot;  In Oklahoma that is like
&gt; &gt; calling
&gt; &gt; you a
&gt; &gt; : &gt; bastard.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; &quot;Yank&quot; is a generic term used by the British for colonial settlers
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; : &gt; their offspring who rebelled against the crown, it does not apply to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; displaced indigenous peoples of Oklahoma by the genocidal mass
&gt; &gt; : &gt; murderer Andrew Jackson (still hypocritically honoured on currency)
&gt; &gt; : &gt; that yanks misappropriately call &quot;indians&quot;.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Southern yanks are also known for their hatred of &quot;niggers&quot;, the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; descendents of Africans forced into slavery, many of whom are
&gt; &gt; : &gt; the bastard offspring of raping rapine slave owners.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I do understand that southern yanks use the term to apply to
&gt; &gt; northern
&gt; &gt; : &gt; yanks, but on this side of the pond we don't discriminate between
&gt; &gt; : &gt; north and south. It is not intended to be derogatory and you should
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; : &gt; take offense if a limey calls you a yankee, most don't know any
&gt; &gt; better
&gt; &gt; : &gt; and those like me who do will continue to use the term.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; You can call me anything you like, but don't call me late for my
&gt; &gt; : &gt; dinner.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : That comment on your math was a compliment as I would
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : have to take that to someone like you to get the answer to that
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : question.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; To be quite honest, that would be like complimenting an airline
&gt; &gt; pilot
&gt; &gt; : &gt; on passing his car driver's test. All I used was width x length x
&gt; &gt; height
&gt; &gt; : &gt; and the surface area of a sphere which I remembered from childhood
&gt; &gt; : &gt; plus a few approximations gleaned from internet data.
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Had I wanted a more accurate figure I'd have used a spreadsheet.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : But, if the sea rises, people have to move inland, think of
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : all the economic opportunities it creates.  New towns, homes,
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : buildings, a economic boom perhaps.  You have to look at the
&gt; &gt; bright
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : side of things, 'cause we aren't going to stop it.  Sorry about
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : wanker husband.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I'm neither pessimist nor optimist, I'm a realist, and anyway I'll
&gt; &gt; : &gt; be dead before it happens.  When Katrina flooded New Orleans,
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; was that a good thing resulting in an economic boom or a bad
&gt; &gt; : &gt; thing resulting in hundreds of deaths? Nature is neither good nor
&gt; &gt; : &gt; evil, Nature just IS and man does not control her. We adapt
&gt; &gt; : &gt; to Nature, she does not adapt to us. Wishful thinking serves
&gt; &gt; : &gt; no purpose.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : No ideas there. Please remember, we may all be
&gt; &gt; : &gt; : Americans, but we aren't all &quot;Yanks&quot;.
&gt; &gt; : &gt;
&gt; &gt; : &gt; I don't call the Portuguese speaking peoples of Brazil or the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; Spanish speaking people of Argentina and Mexico or even the
&gt; &gt; : &gt; French and English speaking peoples of Canada yanks, I call
&gt; &gt; : &gt; them all Americans. &quot;Yank&quot;

&gt; &gt; : Has anyone ever mentioned that the eastern part of the antartica ice
&gt; &gt; : pack holds 80% of the world's fresh water?  If it were to heat up to
&gt; &gt; : 68 degrees F. there, it would take between 10,000-12,000 years to
&gt; &gt; : melt?  As of today the temperature there is a balmy -40 degrees F.  If
&gt; &gt; : all of Greenland's ice melts, the total rise in the Oceans would be a
&gt; &gt; : whole 14 inches?  20 ft has been banded about, but all the weather
&gt; &gt; : models show 14 inches.  Anyone see anything wrong with Al Gore's
&gt; &gt; : thinking besides he desperately wants to be a hero at something?  K.W.

&gt; &gt; Volume  = height * area.
&gt; &gt; Area of Antarctica (never mind Greenland) ~= 14 Million SQ KM
&gt; &gt; Mean height of ice above land, 2-3 km.
&gt; &gt; Volume ~= 30,000,000 - 40,000,000 cubic km.

&gt; &gt; Radius of Earth ~= 6400 km
&gt; &gt; Surface area of a sphere = 4 pi r^2
&gt; &gt;  4 * 22/7 * 64 * 64 * 10,000 ~= 500,000,000 sq km
&gt; &gt; 70% water so  360,000,000 sq km of ocean

&gt; &gt; 40/360 ~= 0.1 km

&gt; &gt; If Antarctica melted the total rise in the oceans would be about
&gt; &gt; 300 feet.
&gt; &gt; Not surprisingly, all of Florida would 200 feet under water.

&gt; &gt; And there isn't a darned thing anyone can do about it,
&gt; &gt; Mankind can't even control his bladder or sexual urges,
&gt; &gt; let alone control Earth's precession or perihelion.

&gt; &gt; As hahahanson says, it's a beautiful choir, let 'em sing.

&gt; I wonder when Greenland will develop a climate and terrain
&gt; like Bermuda&gt;
