Some thoughts on tomorrow's pivotal game
I'm not sure which team has more riding on tomorrow's game. The
Seahawks won the NFC West for the third straight season a year ago,
but all they've heard about for most of the past year is how the 49ers
swept them -- how Frank Gore ran over them. On the other hand, if the
49ers want to win the West, this is a game they need on their home
field.

I wonder if the Seahawks really considered the 49ers as a legitimate
threat to their status as top dogs of the division a year ago. It's
not giving the 49ers enough credit to say that they surprised them
twice last season, but I never got the feeling the Seahawks felt they
were fighting to hold onto something against the 49ers.

The 49ers, meanwhile, are now on equal footing with the Seahawks. Both
teams are 2-1. The 49ers expect to make the playoffs, to win the West.
Certainly, the Seahawks know that a lot of folks see the 49ers as
up-and-comers. Last year, the 49ers were on the periphery of the
playoff hunt. But every time they had to win a game to propel them
into the thick of the playoff hunt, they failed. (See home losses to
Green Bay and Arizona.)

This is a chance for the 49ers to take that next step against a team
most impartial observers feel is still more talented and
better-equipped to win the division. Are the 49ers ready for the
challenge? Or are they still a year away?

Here are some of the key matchups:

RB Frank Gore vs. Seahawks run defense

Gore was in a funk this week. He sat at his locker and answered a few
questions, his disappointment written on his face. The little
interview session broke up. Gore is such a likeable guy, that one of
the reporters told him to hang in there. After 15 or 20 minutes, Gore
approached a couple writers to speak again about the troubles of the
running game. He feels the offense is close to clicking, but that
everyone &quot;isn't on the same page.&quot; There is little doubt the Seahawks
want to shut down Gore. They almost did it when the team met for the
second time last season. Sure, Gore finished with 144 yards, but 106
of those yards came in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks tried to
strengthen their run game with the additions of DE Patrick Kerney and
SS Deon Grant and FS Brian Russell. Gore's big runs a year ago were
possible because the Seahawks' safeties, particular Jordan Babineaux,
could not bring him down in the open field.

RT Joe Staley vs. DE Patrick Kerney

Staley will be going up against the third player in a row who has a
Pro Bowl on his resume. Kerney is a ninth-year pro. He knows what he's
doing. He plays hard to the whistle. Staley said he has always prided
himself on playing hard and finishing blocks. But, he acknowledges
that he hasn't done as well in that area in the first three games.
Still, Staley is playing very well. He is not the reason the 49ers'
run game has struggled. In fact, he has probably been the 49ers' best
offensive lineman.

LT Jonas Jennings vs. LB Julian Peterson

The 49ers might want to run right at the 240-pound Peterson. If they
try to run away from him, Peterson has the speed to track down the
play. But where Peterson is at his best is in pass-rush situations. He
lines up at defensive end to rush the passer, which is a facet of his
game that was underutilized when he played for the 49ers. Jennings
sustained a &quot;leg strain&quot; in practice on Wednesday. He returned to the
field on Friday, and the club expects him to be ready to go. If he
can't last the entire game, Adam Snyder would be the first player off
the sideline. When Jennings is healthy, he's a pretty darn good
player. If he's not healthy against Peterson, it could be a problem.

QB Alex Smith vs. a lot of people and things

Smith and Gore have to perform like they did in pulling off that upset
over the Seahawks on that inclement night in Seattle last season.
Smith has played very well the past two games, but you'd never know it
by looking at the stat sheet. Well, this is a game where the stats
have to show it. He needs offensive coordinator Jim Hostler to call
the same type of game as last week against the Steelers. He needs the
offensive line (and backs) to protect him. He needs the receivers to
run the right routes and make all the catches (especially on third
downs). Then, he needs to solve the mental game of what the Seahawks
are going to throw at him. There's a good chance, he will see a lot of
man coverage on the outside, as everybody expects the Seahawks to get
an eighth defender in the box. Smith has to recognize from where the
safety help is coming. On third downs, he's going to have to identify
the pressure and make quick reads. He's going to have to keep his head
up and look downfield when he is forced to sidestep the rush. There's
going to be a lot of his shoulders. This isn't the kind of game that
he can just &quot;manage&quot; if the 49ers expect to be all alone in first
place at the end of the day.

NT Aubrayo Franklin/Isaac Sopoaga vs. C Chris Spencer

The 49ers need more from this position. They don't need a ton of
tackles. They need the opposition to feel forced to pay attention to
the nose tackle. If Spencer can single-block the 49ers' nose tackles
like Sean Mahan of the Steelers did last week, it could be a big day
for Shaun Alexander. Because if the Seahawks need only one blocker
against the 49ers nose tackles, that frees up their guards to get
after Patrick Willis.

LB Patrick Willis vs. RB Shaun Alexander

Willis leads the 49ers with 35 tackles (coaches film review) in three
games. The Seahawks want to get Alexander going in the first half.
Willis has shown to be a strong sideline-to-sideline tackler.
Alexander, though not a particularly impressive runner to watch, is
effective nonetheless. He has 100 yards more rushing than Gore through
three games. Alexander is playing with a broken bone in his left
wrist. It doesn't appear as if that injury affects Alexander, but if
Willis can get a few hits it might make Alexander a little tentative.

OLB Tully Banta-Cain vs. LT Walter Jones

Banta-Cain has yet to get going, and it's going to be difficult
tomorrow for him to do much against the perennial All-Pro. Banta-Cain
has a half-sack in three games. In the training camp, Mike Singletary
stated that he expects Banta-Cain to get a minimum of 10 sacks. When
Jones was asked about Banta-Cain in a conference call this week, this
is what he said: &quot;He came from New England, so you know he's a guy who
knows to the play the game of football. He's going to try to do things
to lull you to sleep, so you know you have to stay focused at all
times.&quot;

49ers nickel defense vs. QB Matt Hasselbeck

The 49ers' pass coverage has been pretty good, but opponents have
converted 43.9 percent on third downs. That's too high. Seahawks WRs
Nate Burleson, Deion Branch and Bobby Engram will be on the field for
third-down plays. Each of those three has at least 10 receptions and
one touchdown. Hasselbeck is playing very well. The 49ers need to be
able to generate a pass rush without forcing Greg Manusky to blitz.
The team's third corner, Shawntae Spencer, will probably be targeted
instead of Nate Clements or Walt Harris.

Mike Nolan vs. Mike Holmgren

Ralph Barbieri posed the question to me yesterday: Who's the better
coach? My thought is that it's probably a wash when it comes to game
preparation. Holmgren has a good offensive mind. Nolan's strong suit
is game-planning on defense. In fact, Nolan certainly got the better
of Holmgren in Seattle last season when the 49ers came out in a
different look. If you remember, the 49ers decided to go with mostly a
nickel defense, using safety Chad Williams at linebacker in place of
Manny Lawson most of the game. The strategy worked. Nolan won that
round. Where Holmgren gets the advantage is that he's been calling
games from the sideline for more than 15 seasons. Holmgren is second
behind Joe Gibbs among active coaches with 161 victories, including
playoffs. Nolan is beginning his third season.
