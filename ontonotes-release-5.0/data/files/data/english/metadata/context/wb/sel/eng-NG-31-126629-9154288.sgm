What is Bio-spira? I thought I needed to go fishless for about a month when the numbers are right. Also, I was going to use sponge from my LFS that I took a cutting from for my 70G goldfish tank.

That's a good choice Allen.
Fishless cycling has gotten pretty much easy with Bio Spira.
Set the tank up, fill it, run the filters and add Bio Spira. That's
it.
Next day add your fish.
After a week you do start normal, weekly water changes and gravel
vacuuming.
The only problem is finding Bio Spira.

Bio-Spira  is a product  that contains  all the bacteria  needed  to seed &amp;
cycle  a tank  quickly   for people  who want to add fish   quickly,  some
stores  might sell them  as  Bactinettes, Hagen  make Cycle  which  is a
bacteria liquid ,  there are  others out there,

You can  still use the sponge so long as it is still viable ( bacteria are
alive)  Bio-Spira just gives it a boost  of bacteria  to help with the waste
products.

'Fishless cycling' is to establish a naturally occuring waste
processing capability in your eco-system.  This usually refers to
establishing the two strains of aerobic nitrifying bacteria which
remove the ammonia and nitrites, but can also include other natural
forces such as plantings.

The bacteria populate surfaces which are underwater and will be in the
highest concentration where there is water movement (to move the
ammonia/nitrites and the oxygen which they need to do the
nitrification).  This is why a filter's media is considered the point
of highest concentration.

The time it takes for the bacteria to establish their numbers high
enough to balance the waste production from the fish and any other
ammonia sources (decaying plant or animal matter, respiration etc)
will vary between 3 and 6 weeks, if you depend on the aerobic
nitrifying bacteria which exists in the air we breath.

You can accelerate the process by 'seeding' your filter with
established filter media (starting your bacteria colony faster), or by
adding bacteria-starter.  The quality of bacteria-starter varies
tremendously according to source (manufacturer), and conditions
(transport, storage and handling).  Under the best conditions, Bio-
Spira has been reported to establish a bacterial colony in 24 hours.
Under the worst conditions, bacteria-starter might be mostly
ineffective.

Hope that helps.

I hate to post something pretty much unrelated but those were two of
the best response posts I have ever seen. Hear me out... things like
Biospira and cycling seem to drum up posts like &quot;TRASH, GARBAGE, you
are fool if you use it&quot; right next to posts that read something like
&quot;Sent from heaven, you are a fool if you don't use it.&quot;

Thanks to Andy and NetMax for keeping it to the question, which I have

Sorry, I just read your other thread about keeping it on topic, but I
think I would have posted that anyway. I will chime in and say that if
you have
the sponge cutting in a tank that has fish or some source of 'food'
you could probably do without something like biospira. If you think
you have lost the colony of bacteria on the sponge, perhaps something
like biospira would be helpful. As NetMax mentioned, the efficacy of
biospira is not consistent with the claims on the packaging. It has
worked miracles for some and not at all for others.

I'm going to add that Biospira is not cheap. If the handling has not been
perfect the bacteria can die and your money will have been wasted.

There are no magic bullets with aquariums; fish are individual, living,
breathing beings. Patience is something that must be learned with aquarium
keeping and it probably should be learned from the start.

&gt; &gt; ammonia/nitrites and the oxygen which they need to do the
&gt; &gt; nitrification).  This is why a filter's media is considered the point
&gt; &gt; of highest concentration.

&gt; &gt; The time it takes for the bacteria to establish their numbers high
&gt; &gt; enough to balance the waste production from the fish and any other
&gt; &gt; ammonia sources (decaying plant or animal matter, respiration etc)
&gt; &gt; will vary between 3 and 6 weeks, if you depend on the aerobic
&gt; &gt; nitrifying bacteria which exists in the air we breath.

&gt; &gt; You can accelerate the process by 'seeding' your filter with
&gt; &gt; established filter media (starting your bacteria colony faster), or by
&gt; &gt; adding bacteria-starter.  The quality of bacteria-starter varies
&gt; &gt; tremendously according to source (manufacturer), and conditions
&gt; &gt; (transport, storage and handling).  Under the best conditions, Bio-
&gt; &gt; Spira has been reported to establish a bacterial colony in 24 hours.
&gt; &gt; Under the worst conditions, bacteria-starter might be mostly
&gt; &gt; ineffective.

&gt; &gt; Hope that helps.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's a good choice Allen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fishless cycling has gotten pretty much easy with Bio Spira.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Set the tank up, fill it, run the filters and add Bio Spira. That's
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day add your fish.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After a week you do start normal, weekly water changes and gravel

If you have a bacteria laden sponge (from your LFS or another tank)
then I would try that first since this method typically works well and
is free. If you don’t see results quickly then the BioSpira is always
available. For me, I only use BioSpira when I'm starting from scrach
and haven't got any other tanks in the house. If I have another tank
to seed from then I use that.

&gt; I'm going to add that Biospira is not cheap. If the handling has not been
&gt; perfect the bacteria can die and your money will have been wasted.

&gt; There are no magic bullets with aquariums; fish are individual, living,
&gt; breathing beings. Patience is something that must be learned with aquarium
&gt; keeping and it probably should be learned from the start.

&gt; Sorry, I just read your other thread about keeping it on topic, but I
&gt; think I would have posted that anyway. I will chime in and say that if
&gt; you have
&gt; the sponge cutting in a tank that has fish or some source of 'food'
&gt; you could probably do without something like biospira. If you think
&gt; you have lost the colony of bacteria on the sponge, perhaps something
&gt; like biospira would be helpful. As NetMax mentioned, the efficacy of
&gt; biospira is not consistent with the claims on the packaging. It has
&gt; worked miracles for some and not at all for others.

&gt; &gt; Thanks to Andy and NetMax for keeping it to the question, which I have

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Fishless cycling' is to establish a naturally occuring waste
&gt; &gt; &gt; processing capability in your eco-system.  This usually refers to
&gt; &gt; &gt; establishing the two strains of aerobic nitrifying bacteria which
&gt; &gt; &gt; remove the ammonia and nitrites, but can also include other natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; forces such as plantings.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The bacteria populate surfaces which are underwater and will be in the
