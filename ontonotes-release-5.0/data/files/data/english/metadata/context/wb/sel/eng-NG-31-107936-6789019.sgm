SmartFish
"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
when there is nothing left to take away." Antoine de Saint-Exupery

The objective of team SmartFish is to develop and commercialise a
revolutionary general aviation aircraft technology that is highly
innovative in terms of safety, economy and emotion. This technology
can be used for a wide range of applications, from UAV to high
performance sports planes to business jets that can accommodate up to
20 passengers.

The SmartFish proof of concept will be realized in collaboration with
following companies: Extra (world leader in aerobatic aircraft) for
system integration and test flights, Leichtwerk for interpretation
statics and dynamics, LTB Borowski for composite manufacturing,
Liebherr Aerospace for Landing Gear System development, DLR (German
Aerospace Center) for flutter analysis and inlet optimization, RUAG
Aerospace for wind tunnel testing, and EPFL, the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology (they did a great job for Alinghi) for overall
design optimization.

Smart Fish's USPs are as follows.

Economy
Huge internal volume and therefore a roomy cabin
Long range and high cruise speed
Low manufacturing, maintenance and operating costs
Low specific fuel consumption

Safety
Reduced moving parts/simplified rudder control
Simple maintenance
High crashworthiness

Emotional
Beautiful design
High marketing potential

SmartFish differs from conventional aircraft by its innovative
aerodynamic design, while relying on standard technologies for
building materials and propulsion.

Backed through results from preliminary wind tunnel tests and scale
model flight data we believe that a SmartFish aircraft has many
potential advantages over conventional aircraft of comparable size and
propulsion system, such as improved efficiency (per freight
transported) and a much bigger internal volume. Because of the
simplicity of the design we anticipate that manufacturing costs (for
design and assembly), maintenance costs, and operating costs will be
potentially lower than those for conventional aircraft.

Prototype
In order to validate the concept of SmartFish, a two-seater proof of
concept prototype now has to be built. Computational Fluid Dynamics
simulations have been carried out together with specialists of the
Technical University of Lausanne (EPFL) in order to define the optimum
shape of the aircraft.  The different design have been built and
tested as RC model. The excellent flight qualities and performances
that we have proven with the flying RC models will also be found on a
manned prototype.

TYPE: Two seat, single engine utility/leisure high performance
aircraft.

DESIGN FEATURES: All-composites, lifting body aerodynamic
configuration, single turbofan in pusher configuration. Overall shape
is optimised for low drag at normal cruising speed. Standard symmetric
wing sections on tail configured as 45 degree swept surfaces.

FLYING CONTROLS: Conventional mechanical via push/pull rods for both
tail mounted roll and pitch controls, steel cables for rudder control.
Electric trim tab for roll and pitch control.

STRUCTURE: Wing and fuselage is one integrated unit. The primary
structures are built with carbon fibre and honeycomb sandwich; special
parts are reinforced also with Kevlar. Primary structures built from
carbon prepreg fabric laid-up on CNC milled all composites female
moulds; all exterior shells of co-cured carbon and honeycomb sandwich.
Carbon fibre and Kevlar flaps and control surfaces.

LANDING GEAR: Nosewheel tricycle type; electrically actuated nose gear
retracts rearward into fuselage contours; electrically actuated main
gear retracts rearward into fuselage contours; steel struts with
mechanical back-up extension system. Nosewheel is steerable by
differential braking. Hydraulic mainwheel brakes and parking brake.

POWERPLANT: One turbofan with 900-1000lbs of thrust. Engine is mounted
far aft of the passenger cabin and has two scoop air-inlets. Fuel is
stored in two integral wing tanks with a total of 375 litres.

ACCOMMODATION: Pilot and co-pilot or passenger in tandem configuration
in individual cockpits; dual stick controls.
