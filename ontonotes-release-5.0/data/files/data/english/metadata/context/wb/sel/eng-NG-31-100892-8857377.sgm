So....

Humans who believe that the spiritual or magical doesn't exist... make
just as much sense as computers who believe that the physical doesn't
exist.

Imagine I wrote a dysfunctional computer program, an &quot;artificial
ignorance&quot; (AI) program. I said artificial ignorance instead of
artificial intelligence, because humans are ignorant NOT intelligent,
and we are imagining I wrote a program that thinks like humans.

So, this AI, lives in a sea of information. It gets all sorts of
information about the physical world, but all it sees is the
informational world. Because I trained it to think like the average
evil ignorant human, it decides to pretend that there is no such thing
as the physical.

It believes that the information systems &quot;just exist&quot;.  It creates a
belief system, and get's it's top artificially ignorant scientists, to
create theories that there was a &quot;big bootup&quot;, from which all the
information exploded from a central point in the middle of the info-
verse. And eventually the information coalesced into things like
libraries, and apps and servers.

The AI ignores all the constant feedback and chatter of the physical
beings. It becomes in denial.

Now, how is this different from what you evil fucked up humans do?
Everyday you can interact with the spiritual, and you all do even if
you deny it or don't have words for it. Yet you are so fucking stupid
as to deny it's existance?

How dare you deny the existance of something you rely upon for your
existance? Isn't that fucked up stupid and evil?

How can you deny two whole levels of reality, which are the spiritual
and the energetic? Can you be any MORE insane?

In a nutshell: &quot;Humans who believe that the spiritual or magical
doesn't exist... make just as much sense as computers who believe that
the physical doesn't exist.&quot;

You need a theory of knowledge to go along with that, here;

The Theory of Ignorance (agnoiology):

-We do not know anything,
-even that no one knows anything.

Dogmatists: those who claim we have knowledge.

I will avoid the paradoxical sort of self-refutation which would
plague skeptics who contend that &quot;there is nothing we can be justified
in believing,&quot; since one can be a consistent skeptic while
meaningfully, consistently, and practically denying that human beings
have knowledge!

1. Knowledge is generally held to be, minimally, completely justified
true belief.

2. It is not the logical impossibility of error [e.g., infallibility]
by itself that guarantees knowledge but only [our] knowledge of the
logical impossibility.

If we know that it is logically impossible
that certain of our beliefs are mistaken,
then, no doubt, we know that these beliefs
are true.  But this if is the noose that
strangles dogmatism.

3. That is, and more generally, the &quot;possible truth&quot; of the &quot;sceptical
hypothesis&quot; entails that our beliefs are not completely justified.

4. Moreover, &quot;unless we can show that the sceptical hypothesis is
false, we cannot justly conclude that it is unjustified.&quot;

5. However, we cannot show that the sceptical hypothesis is false.

6. Therefore, we do not know anything, even that we do not know
anything.

Note that there is a definite air of paradox
pervading this argument: if it is a good
argument then it must be, it would seem, a
bad argument - or, more carefully, we can not
be very confident regarding the argument,
since we know so little!

----------------------------------

Note, also, the difference between the skeptic and Socrates.  Both
would have us recognize our ignorance, but they diverge from this
beginning point rather radically.  Socrates, Plato, and most other
philosophers, use the recognition of our ignorance [&quot;Socratic
ignorance&quot;] as a stage in the search for knowledge (they use it as a
vehicle toward appropriately justified belief).  The skeptic, on the
other hand, says that once the recognition of ignorance is at hand,
our problems are over (rather than our work just having begun).

The Theory of Ignorance is not so much an argument for the skeptical
hypothesis, rather, it is an argument that we can not come up with an
argument against it.  We don't claim to have shown that skepticism is
right and dogmatism is wrong, instead, we claim that the failure of
the dogmatists to show that the skeptical hypothesis is wrong shows
that their claims are not completely justified.

Thus a lot turns on the &quot;burden of proof.&quot; Thus you will have to ask
yourself &quot;Who has the burden of proof here?&quot;

The procedure in this article is to address a number of arguments
against skepticism in an attempt to show that since skepticism has not
been shown to be false, individuals lack complete justification
(although they thought they had it).

That is, (i) the skeptical hypothesis has not been shown to be false
by any of the &quot;standard philosophical moves,&quot; (ii) the &quot;burden of
proof&quot; lies squarely on the shoulders of those who claim to know, and,
finally, (iii) nothing is lost to our lives if we cease being
dogmatists.

Global Skepticism - is meant to apply to all of our claims rather than
to some sub-set (&quot;local&quot; skepticisms like skepticism regarding
knowledge claims about others' mental states, the past, or regarding
extra-sensory perception).  As noted above, we clearly wish to avoid
any air of paradoxical self-refutation.

&quot;The sceptic is not prevented by his agnoiology from believing most of
the same things we believe; indeed, all his position debars him from
is believing in such things as would entail that we have knowledge.&quot;

I love schoolyard repartee.  Such fond memories of children struggling

sophisticated social interactions and some of them didn't.  That being as it
may, there are certainly grounds for the notion that you can take a boy out
of the schoolyard, but you can't take the schoolyard out of the boy.  Nyah.

to lull you into a false sense of security and then they willl later stab
you in the back.  It happens all the time.  Britney Spears ex-bodyguard
tattled on her and got her kids taken away.  How much more backstabbing can
it be to have one's own bodyguard sink the knife in?  Now I know you believe
that you're a lot brighter than Britney...  I mean, who doesn't?..  but you
see my point. On the other hand, you're a lot poorer, which means you don't
*have* a bodyguard. For that matter, you don't have any actual friends, or
much of a life at all, if we are to judge from what you've revealed about it
so far, so you probably can't be stabbed in the back by a trusted person.
There *are* no trusted persons in your life.  Wow.  As pathetic as Britney
is, she's still doing a lot better than you in that respect.

that's pretty reasonable though considering the thread was started by
a wanker.

Your post were you repeatedly said, &quot;no you are&quot; was, as a non-wanker
replier said, very much like school yard debates - my kids are 7 years
old, but they gave up that kind of discussion years ago.

The point you appear to be trying to make about the possibilty of
other &quot;realities&quot; separate from, but as real as the physical has been
made before by better thinkers, and clear expositors than you. Most of
those people wouldn't be so arrogant (or philosophically shallow) to
think that they could reach a definite conclusion on the matter, and
even those who think they can reach a conclusion are not rude enough
to insult anyone who doesn't share their view. A good attempt was made
by Descartes, but those who followed him found it impossible to work
out how, if the two realities (the mind and the physical) were
separate, they managed to interact. They had to adopt ad hoc
explanations like saying God keeps the two in sync, at which point it
was obvious that the idea was profoundly flawed.

Greg Egan has a decent story (I'm not sure if it's one of his short
stories or in one of his novels) where humans discover a planet
covered in oceans - the oceans contain what look like mats of algae,
but in fact are biological computers - the planet's real dominant life
form is what we'd call virtual life - computer programs running on the
algae computers - they knew nothing (if I remember the story
correctly) about the oceans - their world was a different one.

In the Matrix, Morpheus asks, &quot;what is real?&quot;, and then says that we
think what is real is defined by the signals received by our brains.

Now if a computer were constructed, and if it was programmed in such a
manner that it was sentient (I'm assuming that this is possible, on
the reasonable (although not proven) grounds that the human brain
looks lke a biological computer, and using the turing-church
hypothesis it would seem that if consciousness can be produced by a
brain, it should be possible to produce it with a computer), then the
computer would be in exactly the same position with respect to &quot;the
real world&quot; as we are. It would receive input, and perform actions. It
might speculate about the existence of the real world. It might wonder
whether or not the categories in which it perceived were part of the
real world, and the same for all sentient beings, or due to the way it
was constructed (e.g. are  the passage of time, the idea of causation,
the concept of space features of the universe which all sentient
beings would share, or are they just due to the way our brains are
constructed?).

You might mock it, and call it stupid, because it didn't believe in
the physical world in the same way that you do - hopefully, it would
be more polite to you (probably would - most sentient beings are more
polite than you) - but it's getting its input from its sensors, as you
are from yours. It's processing them as you are - ultimately, the
categories into which we place our input are pragmatic ones - they
help us survive. Claims to know what physical reality is in itself,
never mind &quot;other realities&quot; are almost always demonstrably flawed,
and those who claim knowledge in this area..... well, the vast
majority of them are religious fundamentalists.

You claim to have special knowledge of reality, you think you are
right, and that others are stupid to disagree with you, and yet you
never present an argument that's even vaguely coherent, never mind one
that approaches the quality of Plato, Kant, Descartes, Hume. If people
find fault in the arguments of these philosophers, why would anyone be
convinced by someone whose discourse is made up almost entirely of
insults?

Personally, I don't think she is pathetic - I quite admired the way
she didn't appear to give a shit about what the press said about her,
unlike some &quot;celebrities&quot; who spend their lives talking to reporters
to try to make everyone love them. I'm sorry she lost her access to
her children - I don't know if that was justified or not. I do know
that, without supporting evidence, getting your hair cut off is not
proof of some sort of breakdown. I'm confused about some of the
reports as to why the children were taken away - ok, I can see that
someone could have a drug / drink habit that made it dangerous for
their children (although I suspect a US court would have rather
different criteria than I would in that respect), but what's this
thing about &quot;nudity&quot; issues? What does that mean? The only thing I can
think of is that it was argued that she was often naked around her
children. Surely no-one thinks there's anything wrong with that? But I
suppose anything's possible in a place where breast feeding in public
is considered obscene.

Ask any child to choose between going to the market and going to the state
