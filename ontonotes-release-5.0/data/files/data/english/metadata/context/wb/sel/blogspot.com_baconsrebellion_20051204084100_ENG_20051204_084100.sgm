Republicans Still Don't Quite Get It: Conservative Principles Are Not Enough

"Although some [Republican Party leaders] feel the GOP has veered too
far to the right, leading to two straight losses for the governor's
race, most ... here urged the part to stay the course," reported Tyler
Whitley, a reporter, summing up prevailing sentiment at the Advance, the
GOP's annual retreat at the Homestead.

"When we allow our differences with the Democrats to become blurred
in the eyes of the voters, we risk losing," stated Sen. Bill Bolling,
R-Hanover, and lieutenant governor-elect.

"We must stand up for conservative principles," echoed Del. Robert F.
McDonnell, R-Virginia Beach, and attorney general-elect.

Ignore the counsel of "the elite demanding that we abandon our
positions, thinking that is the way to electoral sucess," stated Kate
Obenshain Griffin, GOP chairwoman.

That's all fine and good. Conservative Republican principles of
limited government, fiscal conservatism and free markets are wonderful.
Those are the principles that animate my writing. But abstract
principles are not enough. Abstract principles, by themselves, do not
solve problems. Opposing tax increases -- a meritorious goal -- doesn't
solve traffic congestion, educate our children or build a better health
care system.

Republicans need to show how their principles translate into
bettering peoples' lives in tangible ways that voters can understand. I
have seen a number of good ideas emanate from the ranks of Republican
legislators, but they haven't gotten much attention. Most of them are
technical and wonkish, not designed to capture the imagination of
voters. And I realize that the job is difficult when (a) the other party
controls the executive branch of government, and (b) a significant wing
of the GOP is so brain dead that it can conceive of no alternative to
raising taxes and pouring more revenue into Business As Usual programs
and policies.

Democrats in Virginia have established themselves as the party of
technocrats, the party of good government. They don't challenge the
system -- they try to make it run better. To a majority of Virginians
voting for governor, that's preferable to the airing spouting of airy
nostrums and the politics of symbolism. Until Republicans can
effectively translate their principles into programs for action on the
issues that Virginians repeatedly say that matter, they will continue to
be denied the governorship.

Jim, I agree with your analysis and its implications.

Imagine if, during the campaign, Jerry Kilgore had promised to hold a
series of town hall meetings on transportation. No one would have taken
him seriously. Republicans are not associated with wonkfests or hearing
contrary opinions. They rarely use the phrase that Gov. Warner has used
to such good effect, "I worked with Republicans and Democrats . . ." If
that doesn't change, they will continue to be denied the governorship.

Well said Jim Bacon. You have to have a real plan. You have to have
something good to beat something bad. Nothing never beats something.

Also, as I tried to point in my last column in the Rebellion you need
elected leaders, identifiable by name, locally and working across the
Commonwealth - like a Speaker, a majority leader, a majority whip, a Lt
Gov, an Attorney General, a US Congressman or Senator to champion our
something against their something.

TABOR and the Freedom and Prosperity Agenda were great starts down
that road.

Of course, the real problem when you start proposing solutions to
education (school choice?), transportation (devolving VDOT funds to
localities, private firms competing with the government), or health care
(an system LBJ created and a relic at best), you get labeled as a
lunatic.

Might I suggest the following: that some of the things goverment is
doing today, government should not be doing?

We might all want solutions for education, transportation, and health
care. But prostrating ourselves before the bureaucratic pantheon isn't
going to get the job done.

The solution really is abstract, if people had the courage to turn
back to self-reliance and away from the nanny state.

MY US$0.02 anyhow.

Republicans may talk the talk, but they fail to walk the walk.

Limited Government

-How is the Patriot Act a form of limited Govn’t?

-How is No Child Left Behind a form of limited Govn’t?

-How is interfering in peoples personal lives when it comes to such
things as abortion and the definition of marriage a form of limited
govn’t?

Fiscal Conservatism

-How do you justify giving tax breaks while increasing spending
placing every american citizen in debt to the tune of $150,000?

-How is cutting the car tax and not replacing the revenue a form of
fiscal conservatism?

-How do you justify giving tax breaks to energy companies who are
making money hand over fist?

Free Markets

-Why can’t my grandmother go to Canada to get cheaper prescription
drugs?

-Why do I have to travel 50 miles to go to the dentist because none
close to me accept my insurance?

How do these principles & policy decisions translate into bettering
peoples' lives?

Anon. I agree that some elected Republicans don't walk the walk of
limited government. In Virginia too many elected Republicans don't even
talk the talk, except in an election season.

Here are some answers from a former American Government assitant
professor. There will be a test.

1.The Patriot Act is based on the Provide for the Common Defense in
the Constitution. It goes too far in 1st and 4th amendment abuses. It
should be red-lined extensively or just repealed.

2. No Child Left Behind is an abuse of Federal power and should be
repealed. Likewise, the Department of Education should be reduced to the
IT department necessary to take care of the check writing computers for
school loans - if the Feds want to keep that extra-Constitutional power.

3. Abortion and marriage are defined as rules of right and wrong in
every culture from the tiniest tribe to the greatest civilization and
the rules are enforced. Since we are liberal democratic Republic the
rules are not based on tradition, shaman/priest/imam, king, clan/tribe,
etc, but by the legislature representing the majority will (what was the
consensus culture until the 1960s). That is why marrying multiple
partners, or having sex with children, family members, animals or in
public etc are illegal Sexual behaviors and medical procedures (by
exception) and a host of other behaviors like speech (cursing, yelling
fire, blaspheming different dieties, criticizing the government, etc)
are the responsibility of the legislatures of a culture living under the
Rule of Law.

4. Increasing spending is not limited government. Hold legislators
and executives accountable in the state and federal government. Tax
breaks are not the class envy you may feel, but tax justice until the
Marxist progressive tax is reduced to the flat tax. Punishing successful
people by taxing them more kills jobs (we will cover this in our econ
class) for other people.

5. Cutting the car tax from individuals puts money back in the
economy and is good for Virginia. Funding the local car tax with general
revenue reduces the money available to spend on other things like the
newly authorized Dean (or Director?) of Homosexual, Bi-Trans- whatever
other coupling and his/her/it office staff at U Va. An alternative would
be to take a per cent of the income tax and give that to localities
directly, no strings attached, and kill the property tax in toto.

6. I don't know what tax breaks Energy Corporations get. I would give
them mountainous tax breaks for every measurable degree to which they
reduce pollution. Corporate taxes are a sham that is passed on to the
public. Reducing corporate taxes to get better corporate behavior (gasp,
social engineering) that preserves what is best about Virginia is
Constitutional - go back at look at the precedents in Roman law and
English Common Law, as well as the Founder's incentives to some
corporations - like shipping.

7. Is it illegal to go to Canada to buy prescription drugs? Don't the
socialists up there subsidize drugs? The government pays part of the
price n'est ce pas? That should about cover the R&amp;D and tort
insurance costs built into the full price. Strengthen tort reform
against greedy lawyers and watch the prices come down.

8. You need to get a new dental plan, a new job, or to form a union
to negotiate for a different dental plan. Or, better, Virginia should
have vastly expanded life long health savings accounts. You could pay
for yourself over a lifetime.

The issues above are not principles, but they are policy decisions
that sometimes violate and sometimes support principles of limited
government. It isn't the job of limited government, or big brother
government, to make people's lives better. It is the task of government
to protect and serve in very limited ways to preserve your individual
freedoms to allow you to make your life better. Or not.

Will, I agree 100% with your assessment of republican leaders
ignoring contrary opinions.

It is a major problem in the Snenandoah Valley, particularly the 26th
district.

This post and the responses to it underscore the disconnect in the
Party right now. Candidates run for office on a party label but, once
elected, need to represent all their constituents whether Republican,
Democrat or independent. Party activists want the elected officials to
always talk and act in partisan tones. The general population wants the
elected officials to act responsibly, civilly, and in a non-partisan
manner, while still keeping to their principles. Those who follow the
latter course are called RINO's but have greater influence on policy and
the operation of government. Depending on the electorate and the
opposition, those who play to the party usually have short political
careers and have very little long term impact on the system but they do
make allot of noise and generate allot of press. For the short and long
term we actually need both in the Party. The present effort to drive out
the "governing" element of the Party is leading to disaster for the
Party.

Which is why there is a debate within the Republicans right now. Is
it "stay the course" or shift to a more moderate NOVA republican
approach. Seems to be stay the course at the moment.

Anon 9:21. If you think the backstabbing, tax and spend Republican
legislators represent the governing element of the Party, then you must
equate governing with the Democrats, like drinking with the drunks, as
some kind of good thing. The budget surplus is only good for people who
make their living from government spending and the politicians who get
their campaign donations.

It's exceptionally amusing that RINOs would have greater influence on
policy and operation of government. Name one policy or operation that is
better, and how, because of some RINO influence separate and different
from the liberal Dems.

The responsible, civil manner to act while representing and serving
(as opposed to caving, backtracking, abandoning, abusing the principles
and rhetoric RINOs use in election campaigns) is partisan Republican. Or
haven't you been listening? The Republican partisan way to act is
gentlemanly and ladylike. The RINOs called party activists what names?
The RINOs are the Chicken Littles of 2004 - and that is the most
accurate, civil, and responsible description for their whining about
infrastructure, essential services, etc.

Actually no. A budget surplus is good for anyone that doesn't want to
pay higher taxes down the line to pay for interest accrued on a previous
deficit.

Wrong. Do you think Chichester & company are going to sit on that
surplus with you and wait for a rainy day to spend it wisely? <
