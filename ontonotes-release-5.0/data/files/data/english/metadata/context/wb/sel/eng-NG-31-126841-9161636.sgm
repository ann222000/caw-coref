Iraq: Where's the Strategy?
By Bob Burnett
On September 13th, George W. Bush _spoke to  the United States about Iraq_
( http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/14/america/14text.php ) . In his most somber
assessment to date,  the President claimed the surge has achieved modest
results and a few  troops can return home. However, &quot;Iraqi leaders have asked for
an enduring  relationship with America,&quot; therefore additional troops will only
&quot;return  on success.&quot; Bush implied that large numbers of Americans would
remain in  Iraq throughout the remaining 17 months of his presidency. He didn't
present an exit strategy, but rather a profession of faith: U.S. troops  can
&quot;win&quot; in Iraq.

In his speech, President Bush emphasized he is  following the advice of the
Commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, General  David Petraeus. On September 10th
and 11th, General Petraeus presented his  status report to the U.S. Congress. He
emphasized &quot;progress&quot; made in  buttressing security and downplayed the
political situation, where little  has been accomplished. He argued that current
force levels – 20 combat  brigades – are required for the security of Iraqi
civilians and there  should not be a significant drawdown of U.S. troops until
next spring. He  suggested that substantial U.S. force levels – roughly 15
brigades – would  be required for an indefinite period.

America continues to be  deeply divided about the conduct of the war and its
relationship to  national security, in general. On September 11th, the ranking
Republican  on the Senate Armed Service Committee, John Warner (Virginia),
asked  whether the current strategy in Iraq was &quot;making America safer.&quot; General
Petraeus replied, &quot;Sir, I don't know, actually.&quot;

The debate about  U.S. involvement in Iraq should be conducted within the
framework of  national security strategy. However, the Bush Administration, and
most  Republicans, refuses to engage in this debate. Instead, the White House
continually changes tactics without addressing the larger issue of whether
the current strategy in Iraq is making America safer.

President  Bush continues to lead the &quot;stay-until-we-win&quot; Republican phalanx.
After  having proffered various justifications for the occupation of Iraq,
Bush  has decided that it's the central front of his &quot;War on Terror.&quot; &quot;Iraq is
one of several fronts in the war on terror -- but it's the central front.&quot;
Thus, President Bush and General Petraeus want an open-ended commitment to
Iraq.

Roughly a quarter of the American electorate supports the  Bush stance.
Because of the communication power of the White House, the  stay-until-we-win
perspective has gotten the most U.S. media airtime in  recent months and support
for the President's position has increased.  Furthermore, the front-runners for
the Republican nomination for President  all embrace the notion that Iraq is
the center of the war on  terror.

However, another quarter of the electorate feels the U.S.  should immediately
begin to withdraw troops from Iraq. Apparently, the  remaining fifty percent
don't know what to do. Writing in The New  Yorker Iraq expert _George  Packer_
( http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/09/17/070917fa_fact_packer )
observed, &quot;The country seems trapped in an eternal present,  paralyzed by its past
mistakes.&quot;

The United States desperately  needs a strategic perspective on Iraq: a
long-term view that determines  the best course of action after considering
national priorities. That's  what Senator Jack Reed (Democrat, Rhode Island) argued
for in his _response  to the President's address on Iraq_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR200... ) : &quot;Do we
continue to heed the  president's call that all Iraq needs is more time, more
money, and the  indefinite presence of 130,000 American troops...? Or do we
follow what is  in our nation's best interest and redefine our mission in Iraq?&quot;
Reed  called for the U.S, to disengage itself from Iraq's &quot;civil war&quot; and to
develop a strategy to deal with both the diplomatic issues in the Middle  East
and the pursuit of Al Qaeda.

Last December _the Iraq  Study Group_
( http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2006/images/12/06/iraq.report.pdf ) , a non-partisan body, took a strategic perspective on
Iraq. They cautioned, &quot;The United States should not make an open-ended
commitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq.&quot;

Both the Iraq Study Group Report and George Packer's New  Yorker article
suggest that a strategic perspective needs to consider  three questions: How does
continued allocation of 15-20 combat brigades to  Iraq affect military
readiness? How does continuation of the occupation  impact the &quot;war on terror?&quot; And,
what are America's strategic interests in  Iraq?

Unfortunately, the Bush Administration has proven incapable  of thinking
strategically. The President and most members of his Party are  locked onto one
tactic: &quot;stay until we win.&quot; Senator Reed's speech, and  the comments of Senator
Warner, indicate there is growing Congressional  interest in addressing the
question of whether involvement in Iraq is  actually making America safer.
Historically, in the American system, it  has been the job of the executive branch
of government to develop strategy  and the responsibility of the legislative
branch to fund it and,  occasionally, make changes at the margins. In order to
change direction in  Iraq, before George W. Bush leaves office, it will be up
to Congress to  redefine American strategy in the &quot;war&quot; on terror. While
possible, it  seems unlikely this will happen.
