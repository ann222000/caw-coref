Many months ago someone mentioned that golf balls made good knobs for
machine tools. I filed that bit of info for future use. Well today was
the future. My drill press needed knobs, so I chucked up some golf
balls, drilled and tapped them.

They are great. Much better than the original. I may have to find some
more balls for my other machines.  ;^)

Thanks to who ever passed on that tid bit.

I've heard that golf balls with liquid centers explode when the drill bit
hits the center. Wear safety glasses.

I have a few files with golf ball handles. They work well there too.

Yeah, I've heard that flying GWB ninjas planned 9/11 also.  But, having
cut and drilled quite a few golfballs, I've found 2 varieties.  1, the
&quot;2 piece&quot; which seems to be &quot;homogeneous mass run through a press which
hardens the outside and leaves the middle marshmallow-like&quot;, and 2,
&quot;wound, meaning rubber bands twisted around themselves with a shell
around it&quot;. Never seen this pressurized center, in a few dozen
golfballs.  I do remember that story from when I was in grade school in
the 70's though.

Are not golf balls rubber bands and maybe with steel, or rubber with acid
center ball ?

The last one the golfers pitched over the road and the squirrels
investigated to see if it was a nut was solid plastic all the way
through (white outside, then blue, then orange.) Old balls (circa
1970's/80's) were rubber bands, and we used to unwrap them for the ball
in the middle.

A tiny web search indicates that liquid centers are salt water and corn
syrup, not acid.

A long while back....

Used to cut open a lot of golf balls.

Three basic types that I found.

-Rubber band wound hard rubber core. (these were the target golf
balls, as the hard core bounced like a superbal)

-Hard all the way through.

-Rubber band wound around a rubber ball full of mineral oil. (These
didna bounce so good)

There are probably others.

The oil filled ones ARE at a pretty good pressure. Stands to reason,
too, if you look at the rubber bands wound tight around the core.

Seems to me I recall reading somewhere that they were just mineral oil
filled. Harmless if ingested at low velocity, though will be excreted
rather faster.

I've been wondering about that. Back when I was kid, cadying,
there were definately &quot;liquid center&quot; golf balls. Don't
remember the brand but it WAS on the order of 60 yrs ago. :-)

Greatest file handles in the world.  Watch out for the liquid
centers, or at least be prepared for them.  Place on the handle
end of a single jack type heavy hammer and use a piece of shrink
tube that grabs the ball and the full length of the hammer.  That
knob created by the golf ball will keep your sweaty hand from
losing the stake hammer.  I tried it on one of our hammers and it
has become the hammer of choice for all.

Tytlist?tilyst? Titlist? whatever still makes liquid filled balls -
Dunlop too I believe. Now filled with corn syrup and salt water. Used
to have a bromine sulfate/sulfide or something in back in the sixties
that was rather nasty to the eyes from what I remember reading on the
subject some time ago.
The liquid filling was for better controp - something about damping
and backspin.

The golf balls that I took apart as a kid had a rubber ball at the core,
about a zillion feet of fine rubber band wrapping, then the plastic,
dimpled outer skin.

I can't see how you could drill and tap that.

How are they made now?

...mmm ... I thought golf balls were made from a very long thin
elastic cord wrapped into a sphere under tension round a central ball
bladder and then given a dimpled skin - I suppose modern ones are

A very small number are still like that, I guess. Those are the same
ones I recall from when I took an interest in disassembling the things
myself - which has passed with age. Many/most are basically solid
plastic - a local squirrel got really determined to find the nut inside
this weird white husk, and literally gnawed half a ball away, revealing
(for that ball, don't recall what brand / model) 3 different
colors/layers of basically hard plastic (not very rubbery).

For file handles, the wrapped type was fine, too.

There are basically two types of golf balls. The million feet of
rubber band ones. Titelist is one of the major makers of this type
felt by most pros to be the most responsive, and &quot;two piece&quot; balls
that consist of a core of rubber like material and a cover. No
windings.

The latter type probably make the best knobs.....

They must be making golf balls a lot differently from how they did it
when I was a kid tearing apart golf balls. They used to look like
Planet Earth, where the crust is some tough plastic, the mantle is
about a mile of rubber band wound as tightly as they can get it,
and the core is a hard rubber sphere with some liquid in the middle
which everyone knew was some terrifying acid or toxic material or
some such.

I can't imagine drilling and tapping something like that - what are
golf balls made of these days? Zectron? ;-)

Thanks!
