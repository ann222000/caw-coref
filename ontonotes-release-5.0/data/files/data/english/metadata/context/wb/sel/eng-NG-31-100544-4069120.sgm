Does anybody know a UK source for a 944 Turbo rear valance? Crumped it badly
on my own anti ram-raid bollard outside my workshop earlier this evening and
I'd rather not claim on the insurance, given that it doesn't look too hard
to replace on a DIY basis. TIA.

Personally I thought it was precisely on topic, except that nobody actually
quoted a Porsche retail price.

Now that is funny - but not quite as funny as my work incident. I worked for
a construction company and took one of the girls out to lunch. When we got
back I reversed into a parking space and was distracted by a pair of
waist-wrappingly gorgeous legs pretending to be hidden by a skirt that was
more like a belt. The side of my car ground all the way down a bollard that
was designed to stop forklifts hitting cars like mine.

As if that wasn't bad enough, the gossip about us had done the rounds, so
there were half a dozen office girls watching the incident who only wanted
to see if we came back in the same car.

The wife I had then was interested in how it had happened, too.

Lol...I thought the OP was on topic for this group too.

I did a similar thing in a shopping centre car park in a previous life...it
was a very low wall that wasnt visible from inside the car. My (then) wife
was with me so I had no explaining to do...she TOLD me what a naff driver I
was! :-)

OK, since its embarrassing story time, I once managed to back a ford
transit into a "cab-less" HGV Chassis (perforating the old "lift up"
door)

I`ve also managed to back into a 3 foot (possibly even 4 foot) wide
column holding the roof up at a local fast-fit tyre place. Yes, it was
quite visible at the time, and the only thing I have in mitigation is it
was painted white, the same as all the walls :-}

To rub salt into the wound, not only had I reversed quite quickly
&lt;CLANG&gt; once I made sure I was clear of one of their ramps, but I was
only there to get a tyre changed that had been pulled on the MOT 20
minutes before, and was heading back to the garage to sort the cert.
out. I parked on an angle to obscure the damage as they checked / signed
it off :-}
