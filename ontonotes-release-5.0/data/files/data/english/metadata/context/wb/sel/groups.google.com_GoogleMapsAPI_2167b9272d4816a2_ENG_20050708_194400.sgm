I've have my map working with markers.
I want to have a Toronto button that will recenter to Toronto.
I have the framework working where a button calls a procedure
How do I reference the initial map object which is created onLoad?

I'm sure many have gotten over this hurdle

include this in your page:

&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onClick=&quot;map.recenterOrPanToLatLng(new
GPoint(-79.383430, 43.645392));&quot; value=&quot;Recenter on Toronto&quot;&gt;

That should work.

John,

Have you gotten that code to work? I tested on Safari on Mac, IE on PC,
and FF on PC and I got an error of some type on all browsers.

I even tried to use the other way you have some things coded on your
site:

&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0);&quot; onClick=&quot;map.recenterOrPanToLatLng(new
GPoint(-79.383430, 43.645392));&quot;&gt;RECENTER&lt;/a&gt;

and it did not work either... You have a working page using your code
we could test? You da man!

I tested it using Firefox (1.0.4 / 20050511) on the Mac. Just tested it
under Safari 2.0 and it worked fine for me. Check it out here:

Also, if you have any kind of error message or output from the JS
debugger, reply and let me know what it's saying.

I have really bad luck with testing stuff and not having it work for
others.

Ok, just tested it on Firefox 1.0.4 on WinXP and IE 6.0.2900.2180 and
they both work.

Did you apply it in the same way as in testing.html? I'll also add the
link to testing and try that out.

The onClick method in a link also works on the browsers tested, except
for IE. IE's wonderful DOM bug is affected by the link, but not by the
button. When I moved the link to the end of the page, it will render,
but then when one clicks on the link, IE throws an error.

Without too much of a rant about horrible business practices and shoddy
software, I'll simply say, &quot;I hate Microsoft.&quot;

Anyway, for me, the button method has worked under all the major
browsers (except Opera, haven't tested (do Google Maps even work under
Opera?) ). The onClick javascript link also works, except for IE.
Placement of the link affects IE's ability to render the page and
manipulate the map.

FYI, putting the map.recenter... code in the href will not work under
any browser, so don't do that if you want a link. Use onClick.

Hope this helps.

John

You have structured your page differently from mine.
I use the samples provided by Google as my base

How does your actually work?
Shouldn't the map object be out of scope in the html button?

John,

I figured out my problem. In fact, it was a problem that was caused
problems with my map resizing based on browser viewer area.

A good discussion of that topic is here:

I had declared my map variable inside of my onload() function,
therefore it was not accessible outside of that function. All I had to
do was declare the variable outside the function, and give it the value
I want inside the function, and all is perfectomundo.

Thanks again!

I wanted to overlay the map with the recenter button and did it with
some simple CSS. You could make this look like a proper button with a
little photoshop work...
