Pogue Surreyman babbles, burps and burbles on...

...Clearly in his cups.

He presents not ONE scintilla of evidence for his far-flung thesis
concerning Tony Blair...

...Whereas Tony Blair has presented HIS evidence quite clearly and
elegantly.

Tony Blair, clearly an intelligent, well-educated [Oxford University, St.
John's College and Lincoln's Inn] Brit, knew what the threat was, presented
the evidence for it and made his case quite clearly in a number of notable
addresses as Prime Minister.

He gave one of the best of them to the Congress of the United States on 17
July 2003 as to the Free World's requisite response to Global,
Islamofascist, Jihadist Terrorism....

...In the best tradition of &quot;Why We Fight&quot; exegeses.

Pogue Surreyman's problem is that he is NOT very intelligent, NOT very
well-educated and therefore constantly cobbles up rubbish, myth, political
envy and prejudice into a drunken, febrile pub-talk broth of lies,
misreadings, balderdash and codswallop.

Par For The Course...

He says:

&quot;I'm pretty convinced&quot;...

Hilarious!

Rather churlish of you to simply repost this totally nugatory message,
silently correcting your own egregious error, when you ought to have
acknowledged your debt to the infinitely more well-informed Surreyman.

Is this the same Tony Blair who announced repeatedly that he was
&quot;absolutely&quot; sure that the WMD (that threatened an attack on England
in 45 minutes) would be found?

...Clearly in his cups.

Tony Blair, clearly an intelligent, well-educated [Chorister School, Fettes
College, Oxford University, St. John's College and Lincoln's Inn] Brit, knew
what the threat was, presented the evidence for it and made his case quite
clearly in a number of notable addresses as Prime Minister.

[N.B. Pogue Surreyman, _au contraire_, has never been willing to reveal his
feeble educational credentials for fear we will all laugh at him and poke
him with cattle prods -- rhetorically, of course.]

He gave one of the best of them to the Congress of the United States on 17
July 2003 as to the Free World's requisite response to Global,
Islamofascist, Jihadist Terrorism....

...In the best tradition of &quot;Why We Fight&quot; exegeses.

Pogue Surreyman's problem is that he is NOT very intelligent, NOT very
well-educated and therefore constantly cobbles up rubbish, myth, political
envy and prejudice into a drunken, febrile pub-talk broth of lies,

It must come with the territory.  Bush used to visit LBJ at his ranch...

http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901338-2,00.html

I knew an army helicopter pilot who did the Austin to LBJ Ranch run.  He
said that the Secret Service would not allow the pilots to leave the
helicopter, and they had to sit in the steamy bird the entire day.  Could
not even go to the barn.  He was not a fan.

The property on Prairie Chapel Road was never a pig farm.  The same family
operated a variety of ranching and &quot;dry-cropping&quot; operations for a century
or so before selling it (and then leasing back grazing rights).  There are
some feral hogs in the river bottom, and it's likely that the original
tenants kept a pig from time to time, along with the chirren's FFA calves,
sheep and the occasional milk goat (and inevitably chickens).

As a clue to property description around here in &quot;dry&quot; country , a piece of
land with really healthy and large live oaks can often be counted as having
once served as a dairy farm, dairy cows' conversion of feed to fertilizer of
especial nourishment to live oaks being the stuff of legend.  Unlike those
of Central Florida, the local live oaks have to try hard to survive, and
every milk cow helps (if she's frequently dipped for the ticks which love
the year round shade and shelter..

The house is all of 3500 square feet give or take, hardly palatial,
especially compared to such palazzos as Gore Manor.

The hay crop's pretty good this year, but &quot;bales&quot; are hard to find
hereabouts.  The commodity is harvested in &quot;rolls&quot;., which demonstrated the
over-weaning lack of objectivity that likely put your INTEL career off on
the same side road as Spenser's traveled.  Rolls are too big (requiring a
special hydraulic lift) to move about and too tall for seats or to hide the
AC, which according to my acquaintance who has dined there, sets out back
behind a little wall.

Any hay &quot;bales&quot; are imported from places where hay is not a meaningful crop.
Like you, they have been lured and trapped...

If you don't get it, Jack, at least try to get it right.....

Hay is usually baled for long distance transport, the rolls and loaves
and big bales not being suitable for transport over long distances.  We
used to ship our hay from Idaho into Texas, Florida, California, New
Mexico and Arizona.  It was all baled.  Hay used locally for feed was put
up in the rolls, loaves and big bales for the most part but some was
baled the regular small size.  What has nearly disappeared in wire-tied
bales.  Two wire hay bales usually averaged 100 ponds per bale, three
wire more.  Though because we never used three wire, I can't say exactly
how much they averaged.  I can say they were too heavy for easy handling
by one person.  The, most used, two string twine-tied bales run from 60
to 80 pounds per bale and don't transport as well nor as efficiently as
the old wire-tied bales.  Truckers like the denser solid bales as they
can get more tonnage on the truck and the load rides more securely.  In
my opinion, quality wire-tied bales make for better quality hay.  Hay,
after curing in the windrow to the proper moisture content, cooks in the
bale or stack.  Wire tied-baled provide the best control for this
'cooking'.  Just my opinion.

In addition to big round bales, there are now big square ones 3 ft x3
ft x 6ft or something like that. Spotted them on I-80, near I-35, so
they could be from anywhere, although probably not  far.
