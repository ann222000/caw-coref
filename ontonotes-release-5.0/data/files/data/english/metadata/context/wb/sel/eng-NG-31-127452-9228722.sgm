Tracking the Siamotyrannus
By Peter Janssen, dpa

Layers of sandstone dating back to the Jurassic era have been exposed
in the Isan plateaus, which are a treasure trove of dinosaur remains.

Isan, as Thailand's north-eastern region is known locally, is a hard
sell for the tourism industry. The countryside is typically flat and
deforested, making it ideal for growing cash crops such as rice,
tapioca and sugarcane but creating a scenery that elicits the same
level of appreciation from tourists that the Corn Belt does in the
mid-western United States.

However, the geographic history that created this rather tedious
landscape makes it exciting for palaeontologists. About 50 million
years ago the Eurasian continental plate collided with the
Indo-Australian plate to form the Himalayan mountain range in South
Asia. In Southeast Asia, ripples from the same continental crash gave
birth to the Korat and Sakorn Nakorn plateaus that comprise what is
now Isan.

As a result of these fairly &quot;recent&quot; geological upheavals, layers of
sandstone dating back to the Jurassic era have been exposed in the
Isan plateaus that have turned it into a treasure trove of dinosaur
remains.

Thailand's first dinosaur fossil was discovered in the Phu Wiang hills
of Khon Kaen province, 370 kilometres north-east of Bangkok, in 1976
by Sutham Yaemniyom, an employee of the Department of Mineral
Resources who was exploring for uranium. The discovery eventually led
to a joint Thai-French palaeontological expedition that in 1982
unearthed Thailand's first major dinosaur site, some 21 bones that
turned into the Phuwianggosaurus sirindhornae, a new genus and species
of sauropod that was 15 to 20 metres long.

The dinosaur derived its scientific tag from Phu Wiang and the name of
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej's second daughter, princess Chakri
Sirindhorn, who has demonstrated an interest in palaeontology.
Four other dinosaur species have been discovered in Phu Wiang,
including Thailand's own version of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the slightly
smaller Siamotyrannus isanensis. Thailand's Siamotyrannus was carbon
dated at 130 million years, making it a predecessor of the T-Rex, only
100 million years old.

Also discovered at Phu Wiang were the remains of Siamosauraus
suteethorni, a crocodile-looking creature and Compsognathus, the
world's smallest dinosaur at an estimated 70 centimetres long, and the
Ornithomimosaur, an ostrich-like dinosaur. Two more new dinosaur
species have since been discovered in Chaiyaphum province, including
the Psittacosaurus sattayaraki, a parrot-billed dinosaur, and the
Isanosaurus attavipachi, similar to the Puwianggosaurus.

Life-size replicas of these &quot;Thai&quot; dinosaurs can be viewed at the Phu
Wiang Museum, situated 30 kilometres west of Khon Kaen city. Energetic
tourists can also hike to the nine dinosaur digging sites at Phu
Wiang, a national park since 1991. The sites have been sensibly
enclosed by cement bunkers to keep amateur palaeontologists and
souvenir hunters away.

&quot;Thai dinosaur bones have shown up for sale on E-Bay and at Bangkok's
Chatuchak weekend market,&quot; said Wickanet Songtham, director of the Phu
Wiang Museum. Although dinosaur fossils are classified as state
property, thefts from sites will go unpunished until Thailand passes a
fossil protection act, which has been under consideration for three
years.

While the Phu Wiang Museum boasts the kingdom's most famous fossil
sites, the newly opened Sirindhorn Museum in neighbouring Kalasin
province has usurped it as Thailand's prime dinosaur show piece and
tourist attraction.

The Sirindhorn Museum, which had a soft opening in April 2007, was
built by the Department of Mineral Resources with a 370 million baht
(11 million dollars) budget. It is situated about 30 kilometres north
of Kalasin town. The museum's displays have been cleverly composed to
explain how Thailand's dinosaurs fit into the bigger evolutionary
picture. There are collections of fossils, both from Thailand and
elsewhere, models of dinosaur skeletons, and various video
presentations accompanied by dual language (Thai and English)
explanations. The museum also houses Southeast Asia's largest
collection of dinosaur bones with more than 800 pieces.

The new museum replaces an older one that was at the same location. It
is close to the Phu Kum Khao dinosaur site where remains of seven
Phuwianggosaurus sirindhornae were found. Although the Sirindhorn
Museum has started to attract local attention, it remains off the
beaten track for most foreign tourists. &quot;Last year we had 210,000
visitors but during the first seven months of this year we've already
had about 300,000,&quot; said Naramase Teerarangsigul, Sirindhorn Museum
director. &quot;But about 95 per cent of the visitors were Thais, and of
the 5 per cent who were foreign most were foreign men married to Isan
women.&quot;

Information Box:

Destination: Phu Wiang Museum is 370 kilometres northeast of Bangkok,
30 kilometres west of Khon Kaen city. Sirindorn Museum is 430
kilometres northeast of Bangkok, 30 kilometres north of Kalasin city.

Getting There: Best to drive your own car. Alternatively, Thai Airways
and Thai Air Asia flies to Khon Kaen Airport, and public buses are
available to Kalasin. Khon Kaen is also reachable by train or tour
buses.

Opening hours: Both Phu Wiang and Sirindorn dinosaur museum are open 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except Mondays.

Boring ...............

Tell us why you re blacklisted in Thailand.

Seems that the &quot;Thai Law enforcers&quot; are after you now, the poor PEDO from
Paris (France)

Now, that would be a far more interesting story

When are you planning your next trip to Thailand?
Latest news goes around that the Thai Immigration is waiting for you to
explain some things in &quot;Hotel Bangkok&quot;.

So, can you now read the Thai numbers?
The well travelled and high educated pedo Frenchman?

You sound every day more and more boring.
Is this what staying in France do to peeple?

Of course you know Thai politics by what &quot;a few Thai ladies (whores)&quot; have
told you.................

Care to tell the newsgroup how you remain seated, nipping on your beer as a
&quot;ba ba boo boo fahrang supremacist&quot; while the reastaurant was on fire?

Care to tell the newsgroup your pedo story about how you seduced a choirboy
carrying 13 condoms?

BTW, you are posting jewels of anti-Thai propaganda lately in here.
Do you plan to come back to Thailand in the near future?
Wonder if the current government know all this and &quot;lesse majeste&quot; you show
in your posts?
Like the one where you were holding a subversive speech in an University
