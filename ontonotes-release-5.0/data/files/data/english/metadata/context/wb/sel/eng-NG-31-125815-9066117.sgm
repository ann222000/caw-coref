Is anyone getting this thing to work reliably? I'm one of three people
I know using it, and it's failing more than it's working for us.

The disk will just drop off the network. I suppose it might be related
to me putting the laptop to sleep without dismounting, but really it
should be able to cope with the loss of a network connection. The disk
will then either not appear for mounting again, or sometimes will
appear but reject every password I offer it.

Should it reject the password, then in the logs it will say &quot;this disk
needs minor repairs&quot;. Of course it will give no indication of this from
the client side, you're left just guessing why it's rejecting a
perfectly good password.

It's a major pain - I'm hoping at some point in the future to start
using Airport Disk for backups via Time Machine, but at the moment I'm
barely using it for anything at all as it simply doesn't work reliably
enough.

Cheers,
Ian

Just noticed - I've reconnected it for the umpteenth time and noticed
the Time Machine back-up on it is being shared out as a separate disk.
Also that the drive is going wild and yep - opening Time Machine
preferences shows a backup going on. Over Airport Disk. Without me
having modified anything at all.

Interesting. Wrong, but interesting.

FWIW, I'm using right now an iOmega NAS server plugged to an almost
fossil Airport base (.11g still), I had to implement a number of sudo
commands to trick Time Machine, now it works, but remember the first
sync will be *extremely* long.
extremely, like, 24h for instance.

An Airport disk, contrary to my NAS, may let you perform the first sync
via USB, but I'm not sure this'll help, as on a network server TM
creates an &quot;enclosing sparseimage&quot; data structure that's apparently not
the same as on a direct USB.

Ah - now this makes a bit of sense then. Because at this very moment a
Time Machine backup is being created on an Aiport Disk, which surprised
the hell out of me since every thread and web site has being saying it
can't happen and I haven't performed any hack at all to try to enable
it.

-However-, it appears to be doing a full backup from scratch again, and
not using the existing Time Machine backup that's on there, which was
created when I plugged the drive directly into the machine via Firewire
and left it for ages. A .sparseimage file has appeared on the root of
the drive, and I have two volumes appearing on my desktop rather than
just the one.

Not sure what to do now. Will be very handy to have a network backup,
but I don't want to be relying on something that's unsupported.  I also
don't want 137Gig of duplicated data sat on my drive, or two locations
for backup.

Grr.

Ian

That's the behavior here too.
I believe the .sparseimage format has been retained because it allows TM
to use all its hard link magic for sure, when otherwise one couldn't
trust the remote server's format to support such an unusual feature.
And because it's a sparseimage, ie something you can write to without
rewriting the complete archive (I understand in fact it's a folder full
of 8Mb &quot;slice files&quot;), it will still update very fast.

The second disk appearing is the mounted volume I believe, and you can
check it's read-only and with ownerships that are not you (this way, you
can read and recuperate the files even by hand, but you can't trash
everything too easily, you have to use the window local menu if you want
for instance eliminate a file from the backup)

I think your initial, non-sparseimage backup will be useless if you
maintain the Airport-related config.
(If from time to time you want to connect the disk directly to your mac,
just mount the sparseimage and point TM on it, or at least that's how I
expect it'd work.)

Now I think I understand. You happen to have done, inadvertently, all
the steps necessary to reactivate the network-related archiving.

What happens when Time Machine starts:
1- TM checks whether the disk it ordinarily uses for backups is
mounted
2- if yes TM checks that besides the name it is indeed the *right*
disk, with the right data on it, and if yes starts updating
3- additionally, if the disk happens to be a network disk, TM will
use, or create if there is none, a sparseimage in order to avoid any
trouble with hard link support.

On step 1, as you maintained the same name for your disk whether
directly mounted onto the mac or via Airport, it went OK

On step 2, because you initially used this disk in a &quot;validated&quot; way,
ie connected directly to the mac, TM indeed had already written all
the necessary hidden files onto it previously (there are among other
dot-files like &quot;timemachinesupportedvolume&quot; or something close to
this, with specific unix permissions -system ones not yours, etc.). TM
for now only writes these files when the disk is directly connected to
the mac -but it didn't need to write them: they already were there.
So, because all these files already existed, TM started the backup
process.
Note that if you had erased your disk before plugging it to Airport,
it wouldn't even have *appeared* in the possible backup volumes in TM
control panel!

On step 3, because now TM was determined to use your disk, and it was
a network disk, and didn't contain any .sparseimage, well, TM just
created it, ignoring any other archive files already present.

Note that if you would now re-displace the disk plugging it onto your
mac, mount the .sparseimage, and move all the initial archive folder
hierarchy inside this image, this initial archive would constitute the
basis for TM to update on when back on Airport.
Still, you may not wish to do this, because of the special unix
permissions: if you want it to work, definitely it's not from the
Finder that you must move the files, rather from a terminal with
complicated sudo copy commands with a range of extra qualifiers.

(Why would you want to do this anyway? Maybe because the initial
archive is very big, and while it's created quite fast when the disk
is directly plugged on the mac, this becomes veeeerrrrryyyy slow when
via airport.
Indeed, I believe this is THE single reason why Apple removed this
capacity in extremis: so as to avoid being flooded by complaints &quot;TM
is atrocious because I left it 24 hours on my crappy 802.11.b-linked
network disk and the first backup isn't even concluded&quot;.
Now, on the contrary, once the first archive is done, the hourly
updates are almost instant: you don't add dozens of Gb every minute to
your main hard disk, and even your biggest 100 Mb new doc + new song
flies on an Airport network.)

So, if you indeed managed to have a working backup finalized via
Airport, you can continue using it without trouble. It will never be
slow from now on, you'll always be able to redisplace the disk
directly on the mac if need be (just mount the .sparseimage), and any
network interruption will be supported by TM the same way as they are
when the disk is directly connected (e. g. you can sleep the mac in
the middle of a backup, everything will restart on wakeup).

FWIW, I am using a setup that is different but close to yours (a
Network Access drive accessed via Airport), and everything is
perfectly fine.

Out of interest, is there any technical reason why it couldn't create and
use a sparseimage on an SMB share? I know it currently won't but I was
curious if there was a good reason for this.

I see. And interestingly, even when directly connected again the disk
automatically mounts the .sparseimage as a separate volume.

I'm quite happy in the Unix world, might be an idea to do that. Then
again I often connected wired to my Airport Exreme (I'm connected that
way now) so just allowing a long run one evening through 'til morning

Hmm. Not sure I can agree with 'quite fast' really. The disk is
currently directly attached and has been backing up a changed 95Gig.
It's been doing so for around ten minutes so far, and in that time it
has done 26k*. And that's appalling.

There you have a problem, this is not normal. It happened to me once
too in the beginnings (during the first archiving). I solved it by
disconnecting the NAS, restarting it, and restarting everything mac-
side (the previously saved parts were kept). Normally, whether on
Airport or directly connected, the data rate should be as fast as it
can.

So, what do I learn from this? Firstly, the backup has now been going
way too long. Secondly, the backup is backing up to the .sparseimage
created when this was an Airport disk. It -isn't- updating the original
backup which was created when the disk was first attached. Despite
this, it's the Ultramax volume (on which the sparse image is contained)
which has a spinning circle next to it in the Finder, not the
auto-mounted backup image created under Airport.

So...I think I can delete the initial backup from the Ultramax as it's
no longer being updated. I think too that I'm beginning to have less
and less confidence in these backups, as the machine doesn't seem to
know where to make them or what to do with them. I think, in short,
that I need 10.5.1 and I need it now please.

Ian

What was it doing between 9:10 and 10:05? Time for Xray^WInstruments?

Did you actually finish a complete backup in the sparseimage?

Until you have, everything will be very long: to create my first, 60-
Gb-only backup via Airport (via an old 802.11.g base station) took me
almost 24h in a row. If you plan twice this volume, you may wait twice
as long, and it's not Apple's fault but just the wifi throughput
maths.
Indeed if your TM didn't finish the first wifi backup yet, you should
consider removing some folders at first (e. g. system, music...), get
a first working backup (you'll see then that the updates are very
fast), and after that, add the previously removed folders one at a
time, when you are sure you can leave the machine on a full night and
don't need it absolutely tomorrow 8:00

No, I cancelled it since after four or five hours it had done only four
gig. But this is not wi-fi, this was first done using a wired gigabit
ethernet connection straight to the Extreme and is now being done with
the drive directly attached via firewire (400).

Wi-fi not involved here - wired gigabit or directly attached.

That's not a bad idea, and in fact I did that for my virtual machines.
It seems in fact that incremental backups will be particularly badly
suited to virtual machine image files and that I might need to rethink
how I use them. Specifically it's my accounts data that needs backing
up, not the machine which contains them. I've been putting the data
files on a separate virtual drive, then sftp'ing the drive image to a
remote site for backup. The image still sits in a .vmware bundle
however - seems sensible for me to move it out of there and into
somewhere I'm happy to have Time Machine back up. Maybe even off a
virtual drive and on to a virtual share instead.

It's still backing up from this morning. Now up to 75G out of 95G and
at least I can see the figure incrementing. Should be finished by
Christmas. All I have to worry about then is the constant drop-out of
Airport Disk that I'm seeing - searching Apple's support forums show
I'm not alone in that either.

Cheers,
Ian

I guess you could stick a piece of Ethernet between your Mac and the
Airport while you're doing the first backup.

It was there. Still horrendously slow - the initial bit in this thread
where I said it managed just 26k in ten minutes? That was over gigabit.
