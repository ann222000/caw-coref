I give up.

On more muse up and gone,
But RMD will carry on,
It was all a big joke,
the man is full of sh*t
time to calm down
there is nothing i can do about it
he's a liar, he's a liar
this bob dylan man
just so you know
i ain't in his plan
he'll carry on until he dies
my love for him is gone,
but at least it warn't no lie
he's a rock n' roll star
that's all he'll ever be
no me n' bob, no happy family
i shoulda known better, yes, i shoulda known
i ate the whole bull, down to the bone
it's over, it's over, this love affair with dylan
but i ain't mad, just depressed, no, i don't wanna kill 'im
i just kinda wish that he didn't write about me
and then maybe who knows what woulda happened, what kinda life there
woulda been for me
i'm a loser anyway, no doubt, no doubt,
i'll do what i always do, i'll sit around and pout
that's all i ever wanted, was for bob dylan to be happy
it looks like it worked, he enjoys being silly
and now there's nothing left for me to do
but watch t.v. and write
there ain't no need, to augment my plight
i don't need to worry if he reads this or not
i ain't never gonna see him, there is no hidden plot
he's bob dylan the rock star, not the kind of guy you marry

Dylan and Rubin. Hope this turns out to be true! The best artist and
the best producer of today. Makes sense since Rick Rubin is now with
Columbia. Their careers point in the same direction: a Rubin-produced
Dylan album. It could be THE album. It almost seems as if they avoided
a collaboration till the time was right. Absolutely right. The time is
now. Dylan and Rubin. The true masters.

&lt;&lt;found this on lee's wikipedia entry, although i'm a little skeptical
about it:

2008 looks like being a better year for Jacknife Lee with great new
news that he'll be producing the new Travelling Wilburys album. This
time featuring Bono, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Kriss Kristopherson and
Neil Diamond.&gt;&gt;marty

Well, according to a profile of Rubin in the New York Times a couple
of weeks ago, Jakob Dylan is &quot;currently&quot; recording a solo album in the
basement of Rubin's house in Los Angeles - the same studio used by
Johnny Cash. What I can't work out is where Garret Lee fits into the
picture? Sharing production duties, producing individual tracks?

I doubt it, since Dylan's covers albums were all commercial flops.  And
while I love World Gone Wrong, I don't think Dylan needs to revisit that
terrain.  What Rubin suggests to me is that Dylan wants to bring in an
assortment of musicians.

Well that's all right then :)

(If he's good enough for Neil Diamond...)

Aside from my dodgy taste (cheers Martin), my basic hunch is that this
rumour will prove unfounded. It reminds me of the &quot;the new album will
feature a new version of She's Your Lover Now&quot; rumour which started a
few weeks or months before MT came out.

Thanks. (D&amp;tD rocks.)

I may well be wrong about the Rubin/Cash albums. I may need to pay
them more attention. I don't think I'd ever agree though that they are
the best stuff Cash ever did. There's something a little too contrived
about the set-up.

I don't mean to say you have to like them just cause I do - just that
I kinda assume they are almost universally admired, and the first 3
especially are some of my favourite albums.  Personally, I find his
'classic' material - ie most of his career - too stiff and hard to
really like.  On the American albums his voice just grabs you from the
first song, and the performances are far more fluid and melodic than
his earlier stuff.  This is opinion mind you, not the law!

Sure. I know what you mean about the &quot;stiff and hard&quot; hop on pop early
sound. I don't like some of his more clunky  Sun sides like Hey porter
that much. Nothing by Cash that's Rubin-produced I've heard (and I've
only heard some) quite matches Walk the Line and Ring of Fire for me,
though. But I also really like stuff like &quot;Life is like a mountain
railway&quot; on the 2nd Nitty Gritty Circle Be Unbroken album: the Cash
voice over a driving but still woodsy sound.

Interesting assessment, though I'm not sure I
understand the &quot;trying too hard&quot; part.  (If you're
referring to the duets, I definitely agree - most of
them sound just a notch above karaoke to my ears.)

But I do want to discuss your &quot;20% excellent&quot; rating:
Now, if my math is right, that would add up
to nearly 2 discs' worth of &quot;excellence&quot;:

5 volumes of &quot;American Recordings&quot;
plus
4 discs of outtakes on the &quot;Unearthed&quot; box set
equals
9 discs of Cash/Rubin
times
&quot;20% excellent&quot;
equals
approximately 1.8 &quot;excellent&quot; albums (we'll call it 2)

...which in turn is probably 2 more &quot;excellent&quot; albums
than most of us would have expected from JC just prior
to the first Cash/Rubin CD in 1994. (BTW, I just
checked Amazon; this CD appears to be out of print in
the US, amazingly enough.)

Sure, as time went on &amp; JC's health deteriorated, it
seemed he didn't have enough voice or energy left to do
much more than sort of recite the lyrics. (Think of his
version of Steve Earle's &quot;The Devil's Right Hand.&quot;
Sounds great in theory, right? Was it anywhere near as
good as you expected?)

And sure, I found &quot;American V: A Hundred
Highways&quot; (the most recent one) to be mostly
forgettable, and I don't have much hope for the
promised American VI, whenever that comes out.
But 2 discs' worth of excellence from a true icon of
American music - who'd been all but completely written off?
Sounds like a successful collaboration to me.

Oh sorry, you said seriously. And you weren't even talking to me.

I have no life.

Can you believe I'd rather sit at home being bored than go to
synagogue?

I don't belong there.

Well, I have to go on Yom Kippur, because of my father. I mean, I
don't *have* to, I guess I don't *have* to do anything. I could wallow
in my bed in misery and never even get up to urinate and defecate. I
could stew there and decompose in a pile of my own waste and feces if
I felt like it.

See Bob! I'm not *that* lazy.

I use a toilet.

I dunno, but there is a youtube out there of Jordan Zevon (post-Warren's
death) and Jacob Dylan doing 'Lawyers, Guns, and Money' on Letterman
that is astounding.

I heard the first Cash one.  I found it just right.  The Beast In Me,
Why Me, Lord and others stood out.  If Rubin or anyone else can bring
forth that kind of emotion and honesty from Brother Bob, it would of
course be a superb record. (Obviously it depends on the material he's
got to work with.)  I'm not holding mein breath, though.  Brother Bob
Dylan's fine producing his own stuff a la Love and Theft.  That one
will be remembered as a stand out record within his career I believe,
like Blood Tracks and much more so than any of his post Born Again
80's stuff, even Oh Mercy.  His forte remains bold Americana themes
and I hope he tackles them again.

I know exactly what you mean, Jumbo. I'm concerned too and I agree
