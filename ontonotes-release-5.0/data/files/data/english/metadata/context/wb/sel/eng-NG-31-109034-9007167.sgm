Today being the 43rd anniversary of the death of Getulio Vargas(1), I
thought
it was time for a TL about him. We can never have enough Brazilian
ATLs
on SHWI, which is all the more reason to come up with a scenario in
which
Vargas does not commit suicide in Rio's Catete Palace but holds on to
the Brazilian Presidency and does not &quot;leave life to enter history&quot;.

For one thing, the attempted assassination of Carlos Lacerda which
resulted in the death of an air force officer has already happened, so
the
military is enraged. The economy's already going to crap, furthering
discontent with his regime. I'm guessing a military coup is going to
happen with Vargas remaining President. The generals are waiting
in the lurch.

Effects? How long would military rule last? As long as the anos de
chumbo lasted (21 years)?Will some of the same principals behind
the 1964 coup be a part of the *1954 coup? Can we safely butterfly
away the political future of Joao Goulart (Minister of
Labor in the last Vargas government)? (OTOH, Kubitschek and
Quadros were both state governors at the time, not sure how
their futures would be affected). Is Ike as favorable towards a
military coup against Vargas as LBJ was towards OTL's coup
against Goulart? (I personally doubt it ; it would be quite difficult
depicting Vargas as a Communist. Then again, Mossadegh
was not a communist either...)

If military rule is short lived, will Vargas return to the presidency
or remain in exile? How is the Brazilian economy affected?

The one positive effect of TTL: no Brasilia. Does Rio remain
in better shape than it fell into in OTL with it remaining the
capital?

Any other effects?

Best,
Stan B.

I doubt it.  There were two factors present in 1964 that were not yet there a
decade earlier:

(1) One thing that strengthened hard-line views in the Brazilian military in
1964 was the idea that the military had been too tolerant in the past; after
Vargas' suicide it had allowed politics as usual to resume and Kubitschek
(with Vargasite support) to win in 1955; and again in 1961 after Quadros
resigned it had allowed the Vargasite left-populist Goulart to take office
under a compromise (establishing parliamentary government) that didn't last
long.  There was a feeling that &quot;we won't make the same mistake this time; we
are going to stay in power until we have transformed the system to our
liking.&quot;

(2) By 1964 the Cuban Revolution had greatly heightened the military's fear
of communism.

In 1954 I think that the military would try to restore constitutional
government fairly soon, with Vargas forced to leave the country. It is not
clear to me whether Kubitschek would be allowed to run for president.  OT1H
he was a member of the pro-Vargas Social Democratic Party; OTOH he was not as
objectionable to the military as a left-populist like Goulart (of Vargas' own
PTB or Brazilian Labor Party) who in this TL will almost certainly *not* be
allowed to run as Kubitschek's running mate.  Even if Kubitschek is elected
and takes office, he may not serve out his term if he tries to make deals
with the exiled Vargas and the more radical Vargasites like Goulart.  (There
is an analogy here with Argentina, where Frondizi was elected president in
1958 with Peronist support, and attempted to integrate Peronists into the
Argentine political system--something which he discovered could not be done
as long as Peron was still alive and determined to return, and the military
still opposed to any reconciliation with him.  Once Frondizi allowed the
Peronists to participate in the 1962 elections, a coup was almost
inevitable.)

Particularly because Goulart was in Vargas' inner circle; he was a
minister
in Vargas' last government. Kubitschek wasn't quite as associated
with
Getulio.

Even if Kubitschek is elected

I was thinking of another Argentine analogy: would a coup d'etat in
Brazil
cause Peron to be more cautious about ambitious officers in the
Argentine
military wanting to overthrow him? Personally, given Peron's mental
state
in 1954, the level of discontent in Argentina, and the widespread
opposition
to his regime, I don't think so, but would the populist strongman next
door
being overthrown shock Peron into semi-sanity and at least postpone
the
1955 coup?

I was looking for that result as well, merely because it would

Yes, since 1922. However, Vargas had a history of ignoring
Brazilian constitutions unless he directly created them (i.e. the
1937 Estado Novo &quot;Polish constitution&quot;) ,He even ignored the 1934
constitution, which he agreed to as president as a compromise
with the old elites. And the military governments didn't really
care about adhering to the constitution (particularly the coup
plotters of '64).

As you say, moving the capital out of Rio could always be
postponed indefinitely.

OTOH:

(1) &quot;April 15, 1955   The New Federal Capital Locating Commission (which had
been created in 1953) chooses the definitive location where Brasília will be
constructed - the 'Sítio Castanho'.  This of course was before Kubtischek was
electred (though shortly after he had promised to abide by the constitutional
provision calling  for moving the capital.)

(2)  &quot;Sep 19, 1956  Congress unanimously enacts the Bill (Law #2,874).&quot;
http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1i.htm#History

With the Commission having removed the excuse that &quot;we don't know just where
we want to locate the new capital&quot; and with the vote in Congress being
*unanimous* (granted that vote was in response to a presiential intiative but
it is at least indicative of the popularity of the idea since obviously many
of the members of Congress were not supporters of Kubitschek), it seems to me
at least plausible that Brasilia would have been created even had someone
else been president.  If there had been a lot of sentiment that &quot;we just
can't afford it right now&quot; I don't think the vote would have been unanimous.

I'll have to look up what Kubitschek's opponents said in 1955 about moving
the capital.  Incidentally, the race among the top three candidates was
fairly close:

Candidate (party) Popular vote (3 Oct 1955) [3]
Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira (Social Democratic) 3,077,411
Juarez do Nascimento Fernandes Távora (National Democratic) 2,610,462
Ademar Pereira de Barros (Social Progress Party) 2,222,725
Plínio Salgado (Popular Representation Party) 714,379
blank 161,852
void 310,185

http://www.archontology.org/nations/braz/braz_rep2/kubitschek.php

According to
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893060-2,00.html &quot;Also in
the race is a candidate who has no chance of winning but who could
conceivably influence the outcome by bowing out and tossing his support to
Távora. The sure loser, running under the banner of his own right-wing Party
of Popular Representation: Plinio (&quot;This is the Man&quot;) Salgado, 54, founder of
Brazil's prewar fascist-type Greenshirts.&quot;

So to prevent Kubitschek from becoming president in 1955, instead of having
Vargas live, we can have a later POD:  Plinio Salgado withdraws, and enough
of his vote goes to Tavora for the latter to win.  What then?  According to
*Time*:

&quot;General Juarez (&quot;Fight the Thieves and Hoodwinkers of the People&quot;) Távora,
56, favorite of army officers and intellectuals. Table-thumping Távora has an
odd assortment of parties behind him: the conservative National Democratic
Union, the anticlerical Socialists and the staunchly Roman Catholic Christian
Democrats.*

&quot;Doctors &amp; Actors. Brainy General Távora would undoubtedly win the presidency
if voters were counted only in the northeast, where he appeals both as a
native son (born in the state of Ceará) and as a man of principle and piety
(his cousin is the auxiliary bishop of Rio). Outside the northeast, Távora
has apparently failed to capture much working-class support, despite 1) his
promise to impose profit sharing on employers and 2) campaign help from one
of Brazil's most gifted demagogues, São Paulo Governor Janio Quadros, who
took a leave of absence to stump for Távora.&quot;

Tavora had been active in the *tenetismo* movement of the 1920s.
http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9099962 He broke with the most famous
of the tenentes, Luis Carlos Prestes, in 1930, when Prestes abandoned
reformism for communism.  Winning with the support of the military,
Catholics, intellectuals, Janio Quadros, and Plinio Salgado's supporters
would make Tavora the product of an even stranger coalition than the one that
supported him in  OTL, but Plinio Salgado's support would no more make Tavora
a fascist than the Communists' support of Kubitschek made Kubitschek a
Communist.

probing around Wikipedia for full names
of prominent Brits:

Knights:

Bolton Meredith Eyres-Monsell, 1st Viscount Monsell, GBE
Hartley William Shawcross, Baron Shawcross, GBE
Sir Worthington Laming Worthington-Evans, 1st Baronet GBE
(born Laming Evans, son of Worthington Evans)
Sir Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain KCB KCVO
(inventor of snooker)
General Sir Crawford Trotter Chamberlain GCIE, CSI

generals:

Lieutenant-General Sir Dudley Russell
General Sir Ashton Gerard Oswald Mosley Mayne

Life peers:

Gordon Richardson, Baron Richardson of Duntisbourne
Greville Janner, Lord Janner of Braunstone
Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood

As for Canadians

Wayne Douglas Gretzky

and some random holders of the Order of Canada

Barnett J. Danson
Maxwell F. Yalden
Calvin David Abrahamson

Russell Broadbent, Kelly Hoare, Cameron Thompson,
Rodney Sawford, Lindsay Tanner, MPs; Senator
Hedley Grant Pearson Chapman; cricketers Bradley
Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Ashley Mallett, Scott Muller.

So it seems widely established through

Specifically it's quite common to use maiden surnames as first names
particularly when Mom had no brothers. Thus our first daughter is
named for her two grandmothers while her sister is named Shannon after
my mother's maiden name. (My sister-in-law said she had the same idea
but ours were born first despite their earlier marriage)

It's even more common to use surnames as MIDDLE names - thus my

As Wellington said,  when told one of his generals was mad:

It is _now_.

But there's no evidence I can find
of Gordon as a first name between the
Middle Ages and 1800 or so. In the
intervening six centuries it was
exclusively a last name.

The current usage as a first name
is thus an example of the distinctive

as a first name.

Which is _not_ confined to the United

That got me wondering - I ended up doing some searches on http://www.sco
tlandspeople.gov.uk/search/oprbirth/index.aspx and there were a (very)
few occurrences of Gordon as a fore name before 1780. It looks like it
started to gain in popularity (in Scotland anyway) from 1810.

I've found a Gordon Hunter whose Testament Dative and Inventory was
recorded at Glasgow Commissary Court on 11/05/1786...

Scott seems to have existed as a (rare) fore name pre 1846 as well. I
don't have the time to try to get a feel for it's distribution over the
300 years of parish records being searched.

A search of the Wills would seem to indicate that Scott was mostly being
used as a middle name (which would support the maiden name usage) - the
earliest Will with Scott as the first name was one Scott Francis of
Fountainbridge Street, Edinburgh and the date given was 05/02/1849. This
means he predated the fame of Winfield Scott.

No Clives found, but then it's not exactly a scottish name &amp; I'm
searching the Scottish records

I've learnt something today :-)

Withycombe (citation below) covers that in her introduction.  Full
quotation below.  In brief: in English it's post-Reformation.  &quot;One of
the earliest examples noted is Lord Guildford Dudley, ... husband of
Lady Jane Grey, whose mother's maiden name was Guildford.&quot;

The other way, a given name appearing as a surname, happened
substantially earlier in English.  Reaney and Wilson, p. xxi et seq,
say that it starts becoming common &quot;in the early twelfth century&quot; but
adduce exampels from the mid 11th C.  &quot;The general opinion is that
such surnames are due to the dropping of 'filius' [son].&quot;, but &quot;It is
difficult to believe in this 'dropping of filius' theory. ... There
seems no alternative to regarding these forms [filius X, apparently]
as scribal descriptions.&quot;

However, as Mr. Rostrom noted, such patterns are not known in at least
some other cultures.  For example, in Irish and Scots Gaelic, when a
given name appears in a byname, it has to have a marker like &quot;mac&quot; or
&quot;{O'}&quot;.  Welsh &quot;ap&quot;.  Arabic similarly: patronymic like &quot;ibn&quot; or
&quot;bint&quot;, or child-o-nymic (?) like &quot;abu&quot;.  I don't know of Gaelic or
Welsh examples of surnames becoming given names, but I'm no expert.
Arabic has examples like &quot;Abdallah&quot; as given names.

I don't know enough to say that unmarked given names as surnames, or
surnames moving into given names, don't happen in *any* other
cultures, but that may not be what Mr. Rostrom meant.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is from a discussion I was in about surnames moving to the given
name position in 16th C English.

E. G. Withycombe, _The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names_,
3rd ed., p. xli (N.B.: British &quot;christian name&quot; == American &quot;first
name&quot; == &quot;given name&quot;):

An interesting post-Reformation development was the use of
surnames as christian names.  One of the earliest examples noted
is Lord Guildford Dudley, son of the Duke of Northumberland and
husband of Lady Jane Grey, whose mother's maiden name was
Guildford.  Another early example was Sir Warham St. Leger
(1525-97), whose mother was d. and heiress of Hugh Warham, and
whose nephew was also named Warham St. Leger.  The fashion became
fairly general among the landed gentry in Elizabeth's time, and
apparently gave rise to some criticism.  Camden writes (1605):

'Whereas in late years Surnames have been given for Christian
names among us, and no where else in Christendome; although
many dislike it, for that great inconvenience will ensue:
nevertheless it seemeth to proceed from hearty good will, and
affection of the godfathers to shew their love, or from a
desire to continue &amp; propagate theoir own name to succeeding
ages.  And is in no wise to be disliked, but rather approved
in those, which matching with heirs generall of worshipfull
antient families, have given these names to their heirs, with
a mindful and thankful regard of them, as we have now,
Pickering Wotton, Grevill Varney, Bassingburne Gawdy, Calthorp
Parker, Pecsall Brocas, Fitz-Raulf Chamberlaine, who are the
heirs of Pickering, Bassingburne, Greville, Calthorp, &amp;c.' ...

The fashion was confined to the nobility and landed gentry until
the 19th century.

Ursula Whitcher looked at Camden's examples:

Pickering Wotton, Grevill Varney, Bassingburne Gawdy, Calthorp
Parker, Pecsall Brocas, Fitz-Raulf Chamberlaine

and noted that the given names were all place names, so far as she
could tell.

Finally!  Like the Queen, I feel like I can finally look
soc.history.what-if in the face.  A pity that the topic is only
onomastics, not military details or political economy ...

My main source is &quot;R&amp;W&quot;: P. H. Reaney and R. M. Wilson, _A Dictionary
of English Surnames_, Oxford University Press.  (Third edition: also
indicated by Wilson putting his name on it and s/British/English/.)
Interesting side notes:

The present work is based on an independent collection of material
begun in 1943 to beguile the tedium of the quieter periods of
fire-watching. ... All surnames included are known to
survive. ... Here I would take the opportunity to express my
appreciation of a very generous gesture which I still regard as a
private act indicative of national sentiment.  Shortly after the
war, I mentioned casually to Dr. G{o:}sta Langenfelt, on one of
his visits to London, that all my books had been destroyed.  Later
I received from ten or more Swedish scholars signed copies of
their books. ...

&quot;S.n.&quot; is &quot;sub nomine&quot; followed by the first headname.  R&amp;W lists
medieval names with dates verbatim (well, with scribal
abbrevs. unabbreviated), and those you can take to the bank.  They
also provide origins, but without citations for each: according to my
local name expert, they are pretty reliable but they've found a few
errors.

I will probably also dive into &quot;Withycombe&quot;: E. G. Withycombe, _The
Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names_, 3rd ed.  (&quot;Christian
names&quot; in the English sense, meaning &quot;given name&quot;: she has Jewish
Christian names.)

If I don't indicate otherwise, my quotations of verbatim names from
Reaney and Wilson are the earliest citations they provide.

They cite their sources for verbatim spellings, like SRSf (Subsidy
Rolls, Suffolk); I omit them wihtout ellipses.  If you want them, I
can provide them.

If they given only one name, like Russel below, it means that the
person didn't have a surname recorded in the source; in Domesday Boke,
it means that it's a given name.

&quot;de&quot; is a marker of a surname of the place name type. &quot;le&quot; marks it as
clearly a surname of the descriptive byname type (&quot;the *something*&quot;),
like &quot;le Muchele&quot; below.

surnames*.  R&amp;W (p. xlv et seq, esp. xlviii):

In London, surnames of all kinds, patronymics, local, occupational
and nicknames, became hereditary among the patrician classes in
the 12th C.  They steadily increase in number and are frequent by
the end of the 13th C.  At the same time, there are many later
examples which are not hereditary, especially among the lower
classes

citing examples as late as 1384.

became a given name, though R&amp;W have no examples.

I Am Not A Name Expert, but I suspect the answer would be &quot;it depends;
it could be a tough call&quot;.  Maybe the name continued being used

It was only in 2004 that someone noticed the name &quot;Diot Coke&quot;

so maybe ___ lasted for a while.

I suspect it would depend on the name, the type of name (Old English

In my spouting of documentation, I've been considering only origins in
the Middle Ages, not current use.

It's based on early medieval documents -- R&amp;W rarely cite anything
before Domesday Boke (1086), but in my last article I had only one
citation, I think, from after 1400.  They were really interested only
in origins and original spellings (of surnames that survived to the
present, and given names if they resulted in surnames).

&quot;For decades as a first name&quot;: the US has recently seen the rise of
Nivaeh as a popular given name.  A country-western singer, I think it
was, popularized it when he named his daughter that.  It's &quot;Heaven&quot;
spelled backwards.  Given that backwardness has had connotations of
reversal (like Mystyplxtxz or whoever, and saying the Lord's Prayer
backwards in the Black Mass), I would think &quot;Heaven&quot; spelled backwards
would mean &quot;Hell&quot;.

Anyway.  Pretty much anything goes in naming in the modern US, or even
the last few decades.

Depends when.  There was the 12th C explosion in weird names: Heloise

radically with the 13th C.  1600 to 1800, over half of every man in
England was named William, John, or Thomas, and slightly over half of
all women were named Elizabeth, Mary, or Anne (Withycombe, p. xxviii).
(Well, it did dip for one half-century: 46.5% for women in 1650-99.
But 62.5% for men 1650-99.)  As late as 1900, over 8% of all Americans
were named William.

Scotland_ at
&lt; http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/towns/townhistory4345.html &gt; says &quot;in

The name is taken probably from Maccuswell, or Maxwell, near
Kelso, Scotland, in the barony of Holydean. The name Maxwell
originates from Maccus, a Norse chief and son of Undweyn, who gave
his name to Maccuswell, a pool of the river Tweed near Kelso
bridge. A grandson of Maccus, John Maxwell, became chamberlain of
Scotland before dying in 1241, to be succeeded by his brother
Aylmer. From Aylmer sprang many branches of the family throughout
the south-west of Scotland.

which points back to Kelso Bridge again.

Not all cultures have a tradition of inherited

The practice of surname as given name is unknown in
hispanophone culture, except that Hispanophones sometimes
import surnames from _other_ cultures for use as given
names (baseball players Wilson Alvarez, Wilton Guerrero,
BronsonArroyo, Nelson Cruz). I have encountered two exceptions:

1) baseball player Beltran Perez (full name Beltran Ojilbio
Cruz Perez)

2) a supermarket checker whose namebadge read &quot;Cruz&quot;. (when
I asked, she said yes, it was her first name, and people
called her the lady with two last names - i.e. the
practice _is_ rare.)

I've never heard of a French, German, Italian,
Dutch, Russian, Swedish, or Polish example, and
only one Portuguese example (General Juarez Tavora

I don't know enough about Japanese, Chinese, or
Indian cultures to address the issue.

Given names as surnames are not that unusual in other
Euro cultures, I think. There was a baseball player
named Felix José; Joseph Joachim (1831-1907) a Jewish-
Hungarian musician; Joseph &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich, an SS
general; Otto John, a German political and intelligence
figure of the 1950s; German engineer Nicolaus Otto;
French, Spanish, German, and Estonian Martins. I could
find more.

&gt;This is from a discussion I was in about surnames moving to the given
&gt;name position in 16th C English.

&gt;E. G. Withycombe, _The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names_,
&gt;3rd ed., p. xli (N.B.: British &quot;christian name&quot; == American &quot;first
&gt;name&quot; == &quot;given name&quot;):

&gt;    An interesting post-Reformation development was the use of
&gt;    surnames as christian names...  Camden writes (1605):

&gt;        'Whereas in late years Surnames have been given for Christian
&gt;        names among us, and no where else in Christendome'...
">

Ha! I knew I was onto something! Thanks very much
for all the supporting information.

The American addition (which has spread) was
to grab the surname of a famous individual
by way of honoring the later - thus, the U.S.
use of Jefferson, Franklin, Lafayette; and
later Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, Lee, Jackson,
Forrest.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I noticed some time ago that while it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; quite common for anglophones to use last
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; names as first names (Jefferson Davis,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Franklin Roosevelt, Preston Manning,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Winston Churchill, Jackson Browne, Irving
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Berlin, Garrison Keillor), it's almost
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unheard of in other cultures.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Nit:  It's quite common for USA moms to give their boys last names as
&gt; &gt;&gt;first names.

&gt; Quite a few surnames from Scotland and northern England are well
&gt; established as forenames -

&gt; Maxwell, Douglas, Campbell, Keith, Scott, Elliot, Gordon, Lindsay,
&gt; Graham, Clifford, Percy, Howard, Neville, Stewart and Stuart, Irving,
&gt; Fraser, Cameron, ...
&gt; --

Many of these are the names of familes who made a nuisance of
themselves in the Debatable lands that were controlled by neither
Scotland or England. The Armstrongs, for example,at the hieght of
their power could put 3,000 men in the saddle. James I &amp; VI attempted
to put a stop to that when he became head of both kingdoms, and it was
ont unknown for people to be hanged just for bearing a notorious
surname.

Many were deported to the Ulster Plantation and elsewhere. Today the
three most common surnames in County Fermanagh are Armstrong, Elliott
and Johnston, all Border surnames, and there are many more. The
practise of naming a boy byhis mother's maiden name is very common
locally, but seems to beconfined to the surnames with Border origins.

The Elliotts are an odd exception. There are apparently more than 70
ways of spelling the name in Scotland, but the Fermanagh spelling of
double L and double T is unknown there, and I know of no one with
Elliott as a given name.

BTW, is there any record of &quot;Clive&quot; as a given name before the fame of
Clive ofIndia?

Or Lenin Ramirez Sanchez, brother of Carlos the Jackal.

I have encountered two exceptions:

&gt; 1) baseball player Beltran Perez (full name Beltran Ojilbio

&gt; 2) a supermarket checker whose namebadge read &quot;Cruz&quot;. (when

Also former California Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso.
Former Cal.  Lt. Gov. Michael Cruz Bustamante dropped his first
name when running for office - an oddly British practice for
a US (non-Southron) politician.

I found one Russian example:
