Hey,

I was wondering if someone here can tell me from a martial artist's
point of view on &quot;CHI&quot;...is it a life force and air, or is it one of
the same thing? I've been told it was air in chinese, but it also
means a life force that permeates the entire universe..recently i've
been told it's one and the same thing..is that true?

There doesn't appear to be any concensus, even among practitioners, as to exactly
what chi is.

That's probably a clue as to what it really is.

Don't mind the trolls. There's many different kinds of chi. It depends
on what kind of art you are talking about, to an extent, as well. For
example there is &quot;hunyuan&quot; chi, there is &quot;hou tian&quot; chi, etc. To be
honest I'm something of an expert, but don't tell the boys from the
peanut gallery, they tend to get a little jealous.

To explain in short; something like &quot;air&quot; is not the same as
&quot;universal ether&quot; which is also not the same thing as a life force.
All three can be named as a form of qi, just the same as how more
mundane things like weather (tien chi) or a balloon (chi chiou).

Martial arts use a form of chi which is developed through chi kung
exercises. Each martial art has a different set of chi kung exercises,
each with specific goals related to the particular martial art. In
general you can't &quot;drag and drop&quot; chi kung from one art to another,
although there is a lot of crossover in the basics.

Here are some examples.
Aunkai's Tenchijin: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MDoLKfxPXy4

If you want a more specific answer to &quot;what is chi&quot; you're going to
have to tell us more about what you want and what art(s) you're
interested in.

Ki or Chi does exist. It is quite simply the life force that all
living things have. There is nothing mystical about ki of chi. If you
are alive, you've got it. That means a living fish has it. If you are
a healthy hamster you have as much chi as a kung fu master.
Ki means spirit or breath in the Japanese and Korean Languages. In
Chinese its called chi.

Kiai (to concentrate or focus the life force) and aiki (united life
force or spirit) are applications of ki.

Your definition does not lead to any implication of something that can
be &quot;concentrated&quot; or &quot;focused.&quot; And that's where the problems come in.

You get the same thing from many classical &quot;proofs&quot; of the existence of
God--they just relabel &quot;God&quot; as something that can be shown or reasonably
assumed to exist, but then they go off on what characteristics &quot;God&quot; has
that don't follow from the so-called &quot;proofs.&quot;

Friend, that proves exactly nothing. Chi as you have defined is just a
synonym for being alive...quite a different concept from an energy
force that permeates every living thing that can be 'improved' or
whatever by performing various arm-waving techniques. It might have
been some sort of explanation in pre-scientific times, but today, it's
just a outdated, meaningless term.

You are correct on all points. Kiai is to focus your full
concentration on one thing ( like a spirit shout), no magic.

Aiki: &quot;United spirit. The spiritual principle of destroying an
adversary's will to fight or the physical act of domination of an
adversary by harmonizing with his force and redirecting it.&quot;

Spirit is just being too.
Pretty simple stuff.

Your attention or awareness is what is focused. another thing that is
just there if you are alive.

Being alive is the life force that permates all living things! It

Since we're speaking English, having a new synonym for &quot;is alive&quot; is of
limited use.  And since Chinese dictionaries also seem to have trouble with
simple words like &quot;forward&quot; (vis. &quot;The Great Leap Forward&quot;) appealing to
them is of limited use.  And since dictionaries define things that don't
exist all the time (cf. Unicorn, Basilisk, Honest Politician, et al) and
define things that are intellectual abstractions (cf. Constellation) that
something is in a dictionary has little to do with any &quot;real world&quot; meaning.

There's someone here who says chi just means being alive, that it is
not a commodity and it cannot be improved.

As I said in my first response to the OP, even the practitioners can't
agree as to what it is.

Without even a cogent definition, discussing the finer points of it,
the various types of it etc does seem like an exercise in futility at
best, a shared delusion at worst.

Funny thing is, both of the lines up above that I was replying to were
posted by _you_.  And since you came in directly on a thread where &quot;chi&quot; was
being defined as &quot;being alive&quot; that portion becomes relevant.  And even if

&gt;&gt; synonym for being alive...quite a different concept from an energy
&gt;&gt; force that permeates every living thing that can be 'improved' or
&gt;&gt; whatever by performing various arm-waving techniques. It might have
&gt;&gt; been some sort of explanation in pre-scientific times, but today, it's
&gt;&gt; just a outdated, meaningless term.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;I just gave a definition of

&gt;&gt; &gt; a term.

&gt;&gt; A unicorn is a horse with a spiral horn protruding from the centre of
&gt;&gt; its forehead. I just gave a definition of a term.

Again, you're using 'chi' generically- manifesting the power of chi is
'jing'. Everything has chi- only intellectual application, good instruction
and practice will allow the expression of jing.
There are different sorts of jing- some destructive and some not.
One should try to actually understand the words before trying to derive some

One should try to use words that have meaning outside the thing they are trying

All we have here is words....'chi' and 'jing' which, in and of themselves, have
no meaning or means of explanation, except within a paradigm that accepts their
reality without equivocation.

One could substitute *any* words, however devoid of meaning, substance or reality
and come up with the same result.

I choose unicorn and, er, fleen.

You can't comprehend a unicorn? You need some fleen, and only intellectual
application, good instruction and practice will allow the expression of fleen.

Not being personal here Chas, but the words you use have no meaning to me, and
the idea that I need to *feel* to make them real doesn't make sense.

Well, the unicorns are an analogy of the appalling arguments put
forward to explain chi. If you take for given that all matter in the
physical world is governed by the laws of nature, which most people
do, then you have a problem with chi's influence. Chi is described
alot of the time as not being in the physical realm. If it is outside

In the same way that &quot;i&quot; exists and has useful, physical applications

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hey,

&gt;&gt; &gt; I was wondering if someone here can tell me from a martial artist's
&gt;&gt; &gt; point of view on &quot;CHI&quot;...is it a life force and air, or is it one of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the same thing? I've been told it was air in chinese, but it also
&gt;&gt; &gt; means a life force that permeates the entire universe..recently i've
&gt;&gt; &gt; been told it's one and the same thing..is that true?

&gt;&gt; I guess I'll take a stab at it.
&gt;&gt; It's the flow of the blood (energy) controlled by breathing and movement
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; man.
&gt;&gt; &quot;Chi&quot; utilizes the natural elements on earth as we go through our life
&gt;&gt; cycle.
&gt;&gt; And if we break it down even further, matter from the universe creates
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; natural
&gt;&gt; elements.
&gt;&gt; -tom

&gt; A fair guess....except some practitioners say Chi is in every living
&gt; (or non-living) thing, not just man.

&gt; Hard to discuss something that seems to evade a clear definition, eh?

Correct. The same problems are encountered with other metaphysical
concepts, such as the soul.

Expect now to see purely physical explanations provided by the
believers, and wholly redundant ones to boot, as well known and

pre-scientific concept, and holding onto it requires obtuse and

No- it's a general word, not a specific one. It always has modifiers, either
direct or contextual. At that, we're almost always talking about a martial
application, so it's more contextually defined yet.
Would you be happier with a more concrete definition, or a more abstract
one?
A concrete definition would be 'ineffable harmony'- unfortunately, that's
the more abstract one as well.
The difference between them seems to be experiential.

Not so much 'numbers' as 'functions'.
'Chi' could be likened both to a prime function and a complex one. In some
contexts, chi means a very basic condition of the Universe; in another
context, it is the complex  set of skills + that condition. The expression
of that skill+ is called by another word, and the style of that expression
by yet another.
A rock has chi- but that's all. An animal has chi- and that's enough. A man
has chi, and by application of his intellect may express jing.

There is some truth to that statement about purple and the blind man.
I can't tell you a whole lot about &quot;Chi&quot; and the universe, because I don't
know a lot about it,  but I can share my personal experience with Chi.

Years ago I learned and exercised Tai Chi with Paul Eng, who came from
China.
At first I wondered how can moving so slow condition the body, as I was used
to doing the harder styles of gung fu.   But never question Sifu out of
respect and always considered it a gift if I was chosen to be taught. It
took me almost a year to learn the whole form of Tai Chi, and I remember
being quite sore from moving so slow.
After I learned the form, the early years of doing the exercise, the feeling
was  tired, and  I would be quite drenched after completing the whole form,
more drenched than doing the hard styles, although I was moving slow.
However after years of performing the tai chi form, the tiredness starts to
go away,  as well as the sweating...this is due to learning the correct
breathing method while moving.  You can actually feel the blood flow or
(energy) move as you perform the exercise after years and years.  The
feeling after completing the form then becomes exhilarating, than
exhausting.

Chi is something you can't wish for, or purchase.
So about that statement, it's difficult to explain sometimes,  the best way
is sometimes through experience.

As far as witnessing or performing any magical strengths from Chi, I haven't
seen much other than Paul a few times knocking me off axis with just a light
touch. The only thing I might have claim from exercising in Tai Chi is being
still quite youthful for my age.

&gt; feeling after completing the form then becomes exhilarating, than
&gt; exhausting.

&gt; Chi is something you can't wish for, or purchase.
&gt; So about that statement, it's difficult to explain sometimes,  the best way
&gt; is sometimes through experience.

&gt; As far as witnessing or performing any magical strengths from Chi, I haven't
&gt; seen much other than Paul a few times knocking me off axis with just a light
&gt; touch. The only thing I might have claim from exercising in Tai Chi is being
&gt; still quite youthful for my age.

That's a very honest opinion I would say. However, couldn't the whole
concept be simplified into the facts that it felt hard in the
beginning, then it became easier and then you could do it without
being tired. Your experience of chi is that it is exhilarating not
exhausting, after years of practice. The question I pose is this:
'What makes chi necessary in this example? Could you just say your
body toned up to the forms, and that meant the adrenaline you always
had wasn't masked by being tired?'

under poor instruction.
Remember that the taiji system prior to the release of the Chen Family
system practitioners, consisted of mimics. The whole Yang system consisted
of mimicking the movements in the hopes of gaining the skills. The Yang
founder learned his art by peeping through a hole in the fence, whilst
serving as a hired-hand. All of the variations come from that founder- the
Chens simply didn't teach anyone that wasn't of a couple of
villages/married/of blood.
There are benefits from their practice, but not the essential transmission
of the 'mechanism'. The whole idea of 'neijia' is to be in that 'internal'
conduct all the time, as contrasted with 'some of the time' or 'none of the
time'.

Sure; if you practiced with little or no understanding or diligence.
On the other hand, if you learned the form with the goal of refining other
skills/applications/concepts, and had good instruction, the concept of 'chi'
would be necessary for an in-common understanding of the body of information
about the 'work'.

It's actually even simpler:  if it has an effect, any effect at all,
then it can be studied.  The blind man may not be able to know the
subjective &quot;experience&quot; of &quot;purple&quot; but once some effects of purple light
are described (like, say, a buzzer that goes off when purple light hits it
or critters that munch on purple flowers but ignore yellow ones), he
certainly can study those.

However, when the subject is &quot;chi&quot; it's either go study for a bazillion
years (how long? long enough to feel the chi of course) to &quot;feel it for
myself&quot; or to maybe agree to get whapped by some proponent of some chi-based
art.  The problem is that the &quot;effects&quot; that actually _work_--things like
getting hit hard by a seemingly gentle motion, or being tossed
around/knocked off ones feet with the with barely a touch--can all be
duplicated without &quot;chi&quot; (I've _been_ &quot;hit hard by a seemingly gentle
motion&quot; in other arts which don't invoke &quot;chi&quot; or anything like it as a
reason, just leverage, momentum, angles, timing, etc., what I called LMATE
in another thread) and as for the getting tossed around/knocked off my feet?
One must obviously have never been a relatively inexperienced Judo player
going up against a really good one to think that proves anything about
&quot;chi.&quot;  The head instructor where I train is a little guy of about 140 lbs,
older than original sin, who can toss me around like a bit of dandelion
fluff while hardly seeming to move, yet no &quot;chi&quot; involved, just really good
LMATE.

As soon as you get into things that _can't_ explained conventionally,
then you start getting into a long string of failures:  Yellow Bamboo,
Richard Mooney, etc.

I didn't say 'lie'; I said 'dishonest'- that false dilemma you presented

I'm first/best satisfied by personal experience; next best by reliable Third
Party; next by 'common knowledge' and longtime historical report-
it's probably best served by less henocentrism on the parts of 'westerners',
sans the race-traitor sinophiles, of course.
I think most of the trouble, on the parts of such scientists, is a poor
experimental protocol, or improper measurement/hardware.
