If in fact the Feds make good on their promise of an imminent, serious
campaign to identify and toss out the illegals, given that the bulk of
them pursue agricultural jobs, what are your predictions for increases
in produce prices?

Bull, only about 3% of them pursue agricultural jobs.  It will have
little effect on produce prices.

We have been subsidizing rich farmers for decades.  If there is enough
money to pay farmers not to farm, I think the produce will be fine.

BTW I think the people being arrested should be shipped out over the
people working.

If all the millions were deported, I'd say the prices would fall for
there being that much less demand.

The doomsday-sayers never take into account such decreased demand or,
if they do, prefer propagandizing their 'doomsday scenario.'

One way or the other: Got to keep those prices up!

We keep hearing that crops are rotting in fields because the growers
can not find enough pickers, but packing house managers never seem to
complain that there is no produce to pack.  And the produce bins are
always well stocked at the supermarket, except after a hard freeze or
some other natural disaster.

Maybe instead of there being too few farm workers there are too many
farmers, and those crops are rotting in field because there are no
buyers.  If widget manufacturers manufacture more widgets than the
market will bear, there will be widgets rusting in warehouses.  The
same is true of vegetable producers; if there's over production,
vegetables will be left to rot in the field.

That would be the case in a truly free market---which is certainly not
the case in the U.S. no matter the applied 'nomenclature.'

On the local news tonight it was claimed that the reason a gallon of
milk in Georgia is now $5.00 (nearly an hour's worth of minimum wage)
is because of &quot;the demand for milk in India and Australia.&quot;

Some how or another I don't believe Australians and particularly
Indians must be paying more than $5.00/Gallon (plus shipping).

Are Americans suppose to believe that milk in the U.S.A. is coming
from Australia and India?

The nice thing about &quot;globalizing&quot; is how easy it is to gouge prices.

How many Americans could actually go to Australia or India to confirm
or deny such bunk?

You are absolutely correct but, and remember that this is what the
government has had planned in the first place, they will blame the
lack of illegals for the rise in cost of produce because the average
American has no idea that they are lying.

The reality is much more complicated, as usual. I don't think that
milk is traded much internationally, but dairy products are. If demand
for cheese abroad increases, then American dairies may decide to
produce more cheese and export it, instead of selling milk in the US,
which will cause the price in the US to go up. If you think milk is
too expensive, either don't buy it, or get together with your
neighbours, buy a cow and produce it more cheaply.

Demand for beed in China has increased, which is part of the reason
for grain prices going up. The price of cattle feed will affect the
milk prices irrespective of what else is happening in the milk and
dairy market.
