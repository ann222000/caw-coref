The title refers to OVW heel &quot;troubleshooter&quot; Mike Kruel, who's about
to get the worst kind of reality check from a certain vigilante.

AJ Hunter has taken a leave of absence from WWE-TV to go on his &quot;Next
Phase&quot; concert tour. However, his Wednesday nights are still free, and
that spells trouble for Kruel and the OVW heels.

We begin after Kruel had somehow, some way, scammed the OVW Board of
Directors into &quot;firing&quot; Al Snow as troubleshooter so he could take
Snow's place and abuse the position. Well, AJ's jurisdiction as WWE
commissioner extends to OVW, and he's about to make Kruel's life very,
very miserable.

Kruel fancies himself a patriotic American hero, but no one's buying.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the June 30 show (taped 6/27):
">

CM Punk, visiting from ECW, is declared the winner over Jay Bradley.
How? Let's check it out.

Punk had scored a pinfall on Bradley, the OVW champion, but Kruel
illegally changed the match to 2 of 3 falls. When Punk made Bradley
tap with the Anaconda Vice, Kruel claimed submissions are illegal.
Bradley's pin of Punk never happens, because as soon as Kruel made
this declaration, &quot;The Hunt is ON!&quot; hit, bringing AJ out.

The commissioner revealed that he'd &quot;gotten some e-mails and voice
mails from several people here at OVW&quot; complaining about Kruel's
antics, and he'd decided that the WWE can carry on without him for a
couple of months. So he packed his bags and his guitar and rented an
apartment in Louisville for the duration (he's actually living out of
a tour bus) so he can clean up the mess that &quot;this so-called, self-
declared patriot&quot; has created out of &quot;greed, selfishness, and a mad
lust for power&quot;. AJ declared the Bradley-Punk match over, with Punk
the winner, and ordered an immediate tag team match---himself &amp; Punk
vs. Kruel &amp; Bradley. Right then and there.

Kruel tried to weasel out of it, claiming he was busy, but AJ ripped
into him again, saying that he's &quot;beaten up thugs and skels like you
since I was 12. Most of them would later thank me for scaring them
straight. You? You're just plain scared. I've got my people
investigating just how you screwed Al Snow out of his job and Paul
Burchall out of his new house. Once I get all the pertinent evidence,
Kruel, the only place you &amp; Bradley will be going to stay is in a jail
cell!&quot;

Ref Goose Mahoney rang the bell, and the tag match was on. Kruel
wanted no part of either Punk or AJ, and started to leave, which would
leave Bradley hung out to dry. Ah, but AJ was prepared for that, too,
as he had the other 2/3 of Force Majeure, Brandon Burton &amp; Bobby
Lashley, waiting for Kruel. Caught like a rat in a trap, Kruel headed
back into the ring, and took a tag from Bradley. Kruel was promptly
squashed like the rent-a-jobber he'd been before landing in OVW. Kruel
was whipped into the ropes. Punk backdropped him right to AJ, who
wiped out Kruel with a devastating Nightmare Plunge powerbomb. Tag
back to Punk, who locked on the Anaconda Vice. Kruel tapped almost
immediately once he realized what had happened. After the match, just
for fun, AJ hoisted Bradley on his shoulders and hit the F5.

In a dark match, AJ's daughter Marie, 19, defeated Milena Roucka in
2:35 with a ThunderForce powerbomb. Roucka, a Diva Search runner-up
last year, was totally squashed by the rookie. Burton came out with
Marie as her bodyguard, at the request of her father. After the match,
Kenny Bolin entered the ring, ostensibly to talk to Marie, but instead
he belittled the teenager, claiming that he could've helped AJ
considerably with the concert tour with his connections. Marie took
the mic away from the portly con man, and ripped into him, saying that
Bolin had learned nothing from past dealings with her father. &quot;I've
got no use for a leech like you, Bolin&quot;, she declared, &quot;I don't need
to have people e-mailing me and telling me I did something I know I
didn't. In other words, porky, I'm not leaving myself open to identity
theft from the likes of you and Bolin Services!&quot;

Bolin approached, but Burton cut in front. Bolin slapped Burton. Big
mistake. Irish whip, followed by a Monster Jam, which left Bolin woozy
for the rest of the night.

The James Boys (KC &amp; Cassidy) were DQd vs. the Major Brothers due to
&quot;Mini-Bolin&quot;'s interference. A 2nd ref came out and told the match ref
what happened, and the fans made sure the verdict was reversed.

A 2nd dark match saw Force Majeure (AJ, Burton, &amp; Lashley) over Ox &amp;
Hammer &amp; Johnny Punch of Gothic Mayhem in 7:45. Marie acted as the
team's valet, cheering on her father until Melody, Punch's valet,
confronted her. The girls engaged in a short fight ending with Marie
KOing Melody with a roundhouse kick to the head. Burton pinned Charles
&quot;Hammer&quot; Evans with the Rainbow Jumper (moonsault) to win the match.

AJ will be off WWE-TV until mid-August, right before Summerslam, and
after losing on UWA Champions Challenge on 6/30, he's out of the UWA
until 8/18.

...but it should have been a singles match between Punk and

the rules during the match to show Kruel what it is like to
be cheated.  &quot;An-eye-for-an-eye&quot; type thing.  Something
like: AJ announces that the match is submissions only.  Punk
puts Kruel in The Anaconda Vice.  Just as Kruel is about to
tap, AJ says that it is now a NO submission match.  Punk
maintains the hold while Kruel frantically taps but the
match, at this point, cannot be won that way.

AJ can satisfy his bully mentality while JUSTIFIABLY
punishing someone.

Well, now AJ is just being a bully.

Ah, but that's never been AJ's style. You break the law, your ass gets

He IS getting his ass kicked, just not by AJ.  If AJ has to
do it personally then he is just a bully.
