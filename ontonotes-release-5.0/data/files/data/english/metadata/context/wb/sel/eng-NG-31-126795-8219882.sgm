Dear Manoj

I am sorry for being late to respond to your query. Accreditation for
journalists is indeed a vital issue that, I feel, needs serious debate.
I request you to circulate my views, as you wanted, amongst your group
friends.

The issue is as follows:

Orissa government through a gazette notification on June 24 announced a
new set of rules for grant of accreditation to media persons. The rules
perhaps would not have created resentment amongst those working in the
field, but for certain provisions that explicitly point at government's
motive to block the functioning of media persons, their access to the
source/s of official information. One can read the rules from the Orissa
government site.

I am just citing a few of them for ready reference. I hope no one will
dispute that this is an age of information and world over people are
demanding governments to open the doors of information so that people
get to know all that is happening behind the iron curtain called
government machinery/administration. The Right to Information (RTI) Act
formulated by the Central government and adopted by state governments is
the outcome of this long demand of people. (All of you must have noticed
the recent national outcry when the Union government wanted to amend the
new born RTI Act to keep file noting out of public view.)

In this backdrop it is an irony that Orissa government's new rule says
media persons without 10 years experience shall not be eligible for
state (those based in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack) accreditation. It also
says the accreditation would be cancelled if a media person is found
absent continuously for three months. There is also the provision for
the government to review accreditation every year and that if for the
purpose of annual renewal necessary papers are not received by the
office within 15 days the accreditation would be cancelled. Freelance
journalists will have to produce minimum 50 clippings of their published
write-ups at the rate of four every month, including one in a major
daily.

Accredition generally speaking is nothing but an entry pass, an official
recognition that the person is in the profession of information
collection. To my knowledge it serves no other purpose. So, in order to
identify who is in the profession to be entitled to accreditation the
rule had it earlier for constitution of a 'representative professional
body'. The Central government in its rule has the same provision, which
was being followed in Orissa as well. The state government in its new
rule has replaced it with a 'nominated boy'.

I hope all of you will agree that the new rule will affect not just the
interest of reporters working in the field but the media as a whole. You
will also agree with me that denying access to reporters is denying
information to the people. Over 100 media persons of Bhubaneswar held a
meeting on August 23 and discussed point by point the contentious
provisions. There was unanimous opinion that the new rule in one stroke
obliterates the time-tested principle for smooth functioning of media
persons. You will also agree with me that any change in the rule should
be conducive, liberal and facilitating rather than restrictive, imposing
and impeding the functioning of the media. On August 26 a memorandum was
submitted to the Chief Minister in this regard.

I know some people are attributing the hue and cry to possible
withdrawal of government facilities, including quarters, for
journalists. During private talks ministers and officials have expressed
such views to me also. Even there are people in the media who think in
that line. I don't deny.

I have these words for those who feel that government quarter is a
favour and the new rules would debar them enjoying it. It is sad that
such people swallow allotment of quarters to signboard political
parties, NGOs, and host of others but not to media persons? A quarter is
a facility. When Bhubaneswar came up as the new capital the then
government invited news agencies and reporters of national and regional
dailies to stay here and offered quarters. Those in power did have the
understanding that media is an indispensable necessity for proper
functioning of a government in a democracy and there is the need for
providing them housing facilities. The government is paying salary to
its employees for doing its work. The argument can be why quarters for
them at tax payers' money. A judge is given quarter by the government.
No one says this is a favour. But when a journalist wants a quarter
there are people to raise their eye brows. I pity the mindset. While
saying so I don't disagree the presence of blackships in the media, for
whom journalism is a façade, a mask behind which they do many things
excepting news. But blackships are there everywhere, in every profession
– amongst the politicians, in bureaucracy, amongst doctors, engineers
…..etc. So, should we have rules to jeopardize the entire profession?

Friends I have put my views. Now it is your turn.

*Press accreditation fracas in Orissa
*

*The newly amended accreditation rules for 2006 have laid down stringent
conditions for journalists in Orissa to obtain and retain their
accreditation.*

*Elisa Patnaik* in Bhubaneswar

If you are an Orissa-based journalist seeking government accreditation, you
are in for a tough time. And if you are a freelance journalist, the task is
even harder. The state government.'s newly amended accreditation rules for
the year 2006 has laid down extremely stringent conditions for journalists
in Orissa to obtain and retain their accreditation. The govt.'s latest move,
termed as &quot;highly undemocratic&quot; and &quot;anti press,&quot; has drawn a great deal of
flak and protests from not only the media, but also from other quarters
across the state. Most of the journalists have rejected the recently
published Orissa News Media Accreditation Rules 2006 and have demanded its
immediate withdrawal.

A new set of rules for grant of accreditation to media persons was
formulated and notified in the Orissa govt.'s gazette published during the
month of June. Earlier, journalists were granted accreditation by the
government following the approval of an Accreditation Committee considered
to be a &quot;representative professional body&quot; after thorough examination of the
applicants' credentials and professional experience. The Accreditation
Committee was formed taking representatives from various media organizations
and journalist associations. But, as per latest accreditation rules, a new
Accreditation Committee has been formed consisting of journalists nominated
by the govt., whose decision the govt. may or not agree with. The ultimate
decision to cancel/grant accreditation to an applicant journalist now lies
solely with the Information &amp; Public Relations (I&amp;PR) minister, a post
currently held by Debasis Nayak.

Other conditions required for accreditation like years of professional
experience, have also been made stringent making it difficult for even
middle-level journalists to obtain accreditation. Earlier, a journalist with
five years of experience was eligible to apply for accreditation, but now a
minimum of 10 years professional experience is required. The amended rules
also note that accreditation would be cancelled if a media person is found
absent continuously for three months.

Freelance journalists would even find it harder to get accreditation in
Orissa. Not only would print journalists have to gain 20 years of
professional experience, but would have to have also written at least four
articles per month (in at least four different publications) and 50 articles
per year. Moreover, one of the publications would have to be major
publication.

As per the newly amended accreditation rules, renewal of an accreditation
card would also prove to be quite difficult. The accreditation card has not
only to be renewed every year, but the publication/organization in which a
particular journalist has been working has to inform the I &amp; PR Dept. about
it a fortnight before the time limit. If these conditions were not met, the
accreditation of a journalist would be cancelled. Besides, the Accreditation
Committee would review the credentials of a journalist every year.

Allegations against the state govt.'s latest accreditation rules are
abounding in the local media here. Many have even termed the present govt.
as &quot;anti-journalists&quot; and that this move has been planned to prevent
journalists from filing anti-govt. stories. The I&amp;PR minister Debasis Nayak
and the I&amp;PR Director B. C. Mohanty especially have been targeted for their
&quot;dictatorial&quot; stand.

Several veteran journalists have expressed their shock and displeasure at
the government's latest move. &quot;The govt. with these rules is trying to
constrict the Fourth Estate in the state. When on the one hand the Right to
Information (RTI) Act is being amended for the free and fair flow of
information, on the other such rules are being framed to curb the spread of
information,&quot; said Orissa-based journalist Gopal Mishra. Moreover, when most
of the states are following a democratic process of granting accreditation,
the govt. here is resorting to just the opposite, he said, adding that the
new accreditation rules would also discourage young journalists from
entering the profession.

At a recent meeting held in the Capital more than 100 journalists after
discussing the new policy, announced the formation of an 11-member Committee
to put forth their recommendations before the Govt. and the chief minister.
The Orissa News Media Accreditation Rules 2006 should be repealed and the
old accreditation rules of 1994 should be reintroduced with suitable and
simple modifications, said another memorandum given to the CM by journalists
from other districts of the State.

Although government sources claim that the new rules would cause media
persons to take their state accreditation &quot;seriously&quot; and screen out
unprofessional journalists, many feel that it would stifle freedom of press
in Orissa. &quot;The Accreditation Rules, 2006 were formulated, framed and
enforced with this malicious motive. In doing this they have tried to
promote a puppet Press by obliterating the collective wisdom of journalists
in matter of accreditation, says another Orissa-based senior journalist
Subhas Chandra Pattanayak.

&quot;There have been cases where the accreditation of some journalists in the
state has been cancelled because of their anti-govt. stories,&quot; said another
journalist who did not want to be named. &quot;By amending the rules, the
government feels that it would be able to keep a check on the journalists
and force them to produce only govt. friendly articles/programmes.&quot; Scribes
in Orissa opine that perhaps, it would not have created so much resentment
amongst media persons but for certain clauses that clearly point at the
state's intention to obstruct the press media from accessing official
information, they opine.

Even if most of the journalists associations and journalists are against the
govt.'s latest orders, the fear of their accreditation being cancelled also
seems to loom large. Some also apprehend that the perks which come along
with accreditation like provision of govt. accommodation (though journalists
pay a nominal rent), special invites for state programmes etc, would cease
making it difficult for them to work in the future. The present situation
has also taken a political turn with some of the Opposition Party members
staging dharna against the govt. for the amendment in accreditation rules.

Though journalists have warned that if the govt. fails to take action they
would not hesitate to revolt against the amended rules, it remains to be
seen what the Orissa government eventually does in this matter.

Dear manoj babu,

Greetings.

Thanks for the concerned communication.

Only from this communication I could come to know that there are people,
even amongst netizens, to whom Press accreditation means &quot;free government
quarters&quot;!

The gentleman/lady who has vitiated with garbage a photo depicting the
Communists in a public demonstration against vandalization of State role by
the State Government itself in granting access to journalists to sources of
information is either ignorant of what Press Accreditation means or is just
a pet parrot of commission agents   to whom Free Press is anathema.

To the present Government, Free Press is anathema. In our mother-tongue we
say, CHORAKU CHANDRAMAA ADUAA, meaning, the beautiful moonlight is an
impasse for the thief. Therefore, for the present pack of commission agents
who have grabbed power in Orissa, entitlement of dedicated journalists to
have access to sources of information in Government is intolerable. And,
hence they want accreditation to be a fantoccini   farce. The Accreditation
Rules, 2006 were formulated, framed and enforced with this malicious motive.
In doing this they have tried to promote a puppet Press by obliterating
collective wisdom of Journalist in matter of accreditation.

I have discussed this phenomenon in my write up on August 01, 06 in
orissamatters.com. I hope that might have come to your attention. I am
giving the link.
http://orissamatters.com/news/?s=accreditation

Please peruse the same and let others know of this.

On the other hand, those who do not know what Press Accreditation is should
be made aware of it.

It is grant of access to sources of information in the Government to
journalists who are considered proficient in the profession. Accreditation
is not accorded to every journalist. It is restrictive in nature, but this
restriction is necessary for restricting anarchy.

Democracy entails that people must be informed of activities of the
government, specifically of the wrong activities; because, informed
participation of the citizenry in selection of representatives to run the
administration is democracy.

But democracy cannot be managed in a marketplace. Running administration in
a marketplace is anarchy. Therefore responsible reporting on Governance is a
prerequisite for running of democracy. In order to ensure smooth running of
democracy, Press Accreditation is contemplated as a mechanism of responsible
reporting. It is not available to every body in the Press. It is not self
generated. It is granted on application. But every applicant for
accreditation is not allowed. Only those who possess the ability to locate
information, to reach information, to evaluate information, to foresee the
impact of information and to judge as to how useful will be the information
for betterment of the society, are allowed to have accreditation. So grant
of accreditation depends upon evaluation of professional proficiency and
credibility of a journalist which normally develops by experience. But who
can evaluate professional proficiency and credibility of an experienced
journalist? Only the proficient journalists can. Therefore the issue of
grant of accreditation was left to collective wisdom of proficient
journalists elected by associations of working journalists and editors.

The present Government has extinguished this. It wants to control
accreditation through the hand-picked puppets by obliterating collective
participation of highly proficient journalists representing organizations of
editors and working journalists.

The new Rules carry no such component that could be helpful to free
functioning of Press.

Discussing this sad aspect, I have suggested in my article sited supra that
the time-tested system of managing accreditation matters through
professional bodies of journalists be restored and, most importantly,
framing of Accreditation Rules be made legislative so that commission agents
in the corridors of power do not get any further chance to play havoc with
the fourth estate.

As regards government quarters accredited journalists are entitled to, a
clarification is necessary.

An overenthusiastic chairman of the Press Council of India, a retired judge
of Supreme Court, a couple of years ago, had forgotten self-discipline in
this matter and had expressed high sounding homilies that journalists should
have no entitlement to govt. accommodation as thereby they   may not feel
free to expose official misdeeds. I had, as Secretary of the Forum of
Freelance Journalists, wrote him a letter enumerating therein some instances
of his rulings against the Government issued when he was residing in a
rent-free govt. quarter. When a judge resides in a rent-free govt. quarters
but delivers verdicts that disadvantages the govt. why should he or any body
fear that a journalist who pays rent for a govt. qrs. would hesitate to
expose the government? I had sent him samples of my own reports and wanted
him to say if they were pro-government. He understood where had he erred and
kept mum. Till he left the PCI, I had never seen him in indulging in
spreading sophomoric slanders against the scribes again.

In every State, including the Union H.Q., accredited journalists whose work
is held essential for proper functioning of democracy and who are required
to work at any odd point of time, are allotted with govt. accommodation on
rent (NEVER RENT-FREE AS THE WEB-SITE RANTS). And, no proof is necessary to
say that it is they who have exposed misdeeds of governments after
governments leading to change of governments by the awakened people, time
and again, on the basis of which, notwithstanding the shadow of plutocracy,
we still claim to be a democracy.

So the net rant in question is redundant, if not a part of some clandestine
operator's vomit. I believe, this clarification read with the write up I
have given the link to, would help in seeing into the issue.

Thanks again for the just, timely and appropriate concern for preservation
of freedom of Press.

It would be nice of you to please let me know how others react.

Regards,

Subhas
