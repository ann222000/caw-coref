Is anyone doing business with inkjets.com?  I placed an order with
them over a month ago.  I haven't received my ink from them, and have
received no communications from them.  I emailed them to inquire 2
weeks ago, and
they haven't responded.  I opened a dispute with PayPal, and once
again, I've heard nothing from inkjets.com, or from PayPal (yet). That
was 5
days aog, so maybe the dispute with PayPal will ultimately be
addressed.  I may have to contact my bank to try and get my money
back.  Buyer beware....

I've never used inkjets.com or paypal.  I have always ordered from
PrintPal ... went online and found out how much money was needed and
printed out the order then sent check and order.  Always got excellent
service.

Actually, PayPal kept the claim open for about 10 days.  When they
didn't get any response from Inkjets.com either, they credited my
account.
