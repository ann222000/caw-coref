the cable adjuster is under the center console, behind the parking brake
lever.  the rear calipers or drums are supposed to be self adjusting.
if they're not, you may need to strip and clean them - that doesn't
require cable adjustment.

but why do you need to adjust?  unless you've changed the cables or have
badly fitting after-market brake shoes, you should never need to touch it.

suggest you remove the drums [if it is drums] and inspect - may not have
been assembled right.  the self-adjusters should take up the slack -
pump the foot brake 20-30 times to do it.  should hear a clicking each
time you release if they're working right.

Instead of replacing or adjusting anything, I suggest you sell me the car...   ;-)
