Coimbatore - Pre Blast; Blast; Post Blast

The Beginning:

Islamic fundamentalism in independent India took roots in
Muslim pockets of India with Clandestine infiltration of
the Pakistan based terrorists supported by ISI. The
continuous terror attacks in the Kashmir valley, in the
name of freedom fight, served as fuel for the rise in
Islamic fanaticism. The demolition of Babri Masjid in Dec
1992 and the consequent Mumbai riots followed by the serial
blasts in 1993 created an obvious division on religious
grounds. Since then, Islamic militants with the connivance
of local outfits have perpetrated repeated terror attacks
on Indian soil. The student Islamic movement of India.
(SIMI) became very active fanned by the clerics and trained
by the ISI. They spread to all corners of the country and
clandestinely operated in different cities, in different
names. In Tamil Nadu it took the name of &quot;Al-Umma&quot; and
&quot;Jihad Committee&quot;.

Pre-Blast: &quot;Al Umma&quot; made its first major strike at the RSS
head quarters in Chennai in Nov 1993 -- killing 11 people-
in the name of retaliation for Babri demolition. The Tamil
Nadu police arrested S.A. Basha and 15 others under TADA at
Coimbatore. That one incident was enough for the then
AIADMK government to act tough on terrorist outfits and the
TN police brought the volatile situation under control.
'Kottamedu' in Coimbatore was the most notorious place
where Islamic terrorism was reared and the police set up 5
check posts in kottiamedu, and other Muslim pockets of the
city.

In the meantime, TamilNadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK)
was launched in 1995 with a political colour to be
deliberately different from Al-Umma, which was seen as a
violent outfit. But most of the Muslim youth were allegedly
members in both the outfits and the TMMK was allegedly
started to give a political colour to Islamic
fundamentalism. During April 1996 election, the DMK
candidates M.Thandapani (MP) and Ramanathan (MLA) promised
the Muslim community that the check posts in their areas
would be removed provided if they were voted to power. Even
before announcing the victory of DMK, Muslim youth
demolished the check posts and two constables were even
stabbed in the melee. By the end of 1996 a Coimbatore
prison official Boopalan was also murdered by Muslim
militants.

With the advent of the DMK government, the &quot;AL-Umma&quot; and
&quot;Jihad committee&quot; indulged in clandestine operations. The
organizations like &quot;Hindu Makkal katchi&quot; were forced to
retaliate, resulting in frequent stabbings and attacks. The
&quot;AL-Umma&quot; men (16 including their chief Basha) who were
arrested for RSS office attack were released on Bail in
January 1997. On February 8 1997, a powerful blast occurred
in the premises of Mohammadiya rice mill at saliyamangalam
near Thanjavur and the police seized a huge quantity of
gelatin sticks, sulphur, ammonium nitrate, nitric acid,
sulphuric acid, detonators and pistols from the premises of
the mill. Again on 10th February 1997 the Chennai city
police seized around 1000 detonators packed in cardboard
boxes from one Amanulla, who had come to Chennai from
Coimbatore. On the same day in Tambaram, a suburb of
Chennai, a cyclist was arrested with detonators and clocks
with wires. On the 11 th of March 1997, the Chennai city
police seized a huge cache of arms, explosives, detonators,
pipes &amp; wires etc, from a place called kodungaiyur, and
arrested two &quot;Al-Umma&quot; men one of them being Basha's
brother Mohammed Khan. On 29th of November 1997 in
Coimbatore city, traffic constable by name Selvaraj was
murdered by three &quot;Al-Umma&quot; men in broad daylight and in
the subsequent combing operation by the police, 17 Muslims
lost their lives in firing. Since then Coimbatore city was
always under threat of violence and state intelligence
provided the government with confirmed information on the
imminent terror attacks. As evidence to the intelligence
reports huge cache or arms and explosives were seized from
different places, particularly in Chennai &amp; Coimbatore. On
the 6th December 1997, bombs went in three different trains
leaving Chennai Central Station, planted by &quot;Islmamic
Defense Force&quot; of Kerala, in which nine people were killed
and over 70 injured. This &quot;Islamic Defense Force&quot; has
common ideologies with &quot;Al Umma&quot; and they have developed
network, communication and exchange of arms, as they have
been situated on the border of areas of Tamil Nadu &amp;
Kerala, the land of Abdul Nassar Madhani, President,
People's Democratic Party.

Blasts: The State Intelligence had informed the government
on 31st of January 1998 and again on 12th or February 1998
(as per media reports) about a possible terror attack
during the visit of BJP leader Mr. L.K. Adwani. Despite the
intelligence reports, the state government failed to act,
or rather, preferred not to act, in time, probably with an
eye on vote banks and other electoral factors. On Saturday
the 14th of February 1998 between 3.50pm and 4.30pm, 13
bombs exploded in 11 different places killing 45 people
including 10 women and one child. Ten more persons were
killed in the next few days, taking the total official
tally to 59 Casualties and over 200 maimed. The unofficial
casualty figure was believed to be around 150 to 200. On 15
th Feb, Six &quot;Al-Umma&quot; cadres died following a police raid
on their hideout and again on 17ths Feb, four men died
following an accidental blast in their hideout in Al-Ameen
colony. As far as the serial blasts are concerned, the
bombs were placed in bullock carts, fruit carts, two
wheelers, bicycle boxes, containers, etc along the route
from Airport to meeting venue and near the railway station.
The Army, police and NSG diffused several bombs, which
failed to detonate. A car laden with 70 Kg of explosives
was found abandoned in Lokamanya Tilak Street, R.S.Puram,
just behind the famous Annapoorna Hotel and it took 4 days
of meticulous operation to dismantle the device.

On the same day of the blast, the state government banned
&quot;Al-Umma&quot; and &quot;Jihad Committee&quot;, a move that came under
severe criticism by the people as &quot;Worshipping Sun God
after becoming blind&quot;. In the consequent combing operation
in Coimbatore city, police seized large quantities or
gelatin sticks, petrol bombs, pipe bombs, detonators,
knives, swords, pick axes and sickles, apart from
batteries, wires etc. &quot;Al-Umma&quot; leader S.A. Basha with 12
accomplices and hundred odd cadres belonging to the &quot;Al-
Umma&quot;, &quot;TMMK&quot; and &quot;Jihad Committee&quot; were arrested and
lodged in Coimbatore Central prison. The People's
Democratic Party (formerly known as Islmaic Seva Sangh)
leader Abdul Nassar Madhani from Kerala was also arrested
and lodged in Coimbatore prison. The then Left Front
government led by E.K. Nayanar handed him over to Tamil
Nadu police.

Post-Blast: First Information reports were lodged and cases
were registered in the respective police stations and then
transferred to CB-CID. The preliminary charge sheets were
filed on 28 th September 1998 and the final charge sheets
were filed on 5th of May 1999. Special Court for Bomb Blast
cases was constituted in April 2000. Justice Gokula
Krishnan who was inquiring into the communal violence and
police firing between Nov-Dec 1997 submitted his reports in
May 2000.

In 2001 elections, the DMK lost and AIDMK came back to
power. Charges were framed against the accused in October
2001. Examination of witness began in March 2002. In the
meantime, several attempts were made to bail out Madhani,
but only in vain. The Jayalalitha government took a tough
stand on this case and when the then Home Secretary of
Tamil Nadu Mr. Munir Hoda attempted to help for bailing out
Madhani without the knowledge of the CM Jayalalitha, he was
suspended for his arrogant &amp; stupid action.

Then, when the DMK came back to power in May 2006, Munir
Hoda was reinstated as the Chief minister's Personal
Secretary. The Kerala Assembly unanimously passed a
shocking unprecedented resolution seeking the release of
Madhani on humanitarian grounds. The Kerala Chief Minister
Achuthananthan sent his ministers to Coimbatore prison to
meet Madhani for the sake of giving moral support and the
Chief Minister himself came and met his Tamil Nadu
counterpart to secure his release in the guise of Mulla
Periyar talks. Karunanidhi wisely but cautiously refused to
release, but at the same time agreed to arrange for an
Ayurvedic Spa inside the prison exclusively for Madhani.

The arguments in the case started in June 2006 and got
completed in April 2007, examining 1300 witnesses out of
2345. Even before the arguments started, organizations like
TMMK, DK. (Dravidar Kazhagam) MNP (Maritha Neethi Paasarai)
VSK (Viduthalai Siruthai Katchi) put pressure on CM
karunanidhi and demanded bail for the 100 and odd
prisoners. The pressure forced the prosecution to conduct
the arguments in a haphazard, half-baked and halfhearted
manner. Finally on the 1st of August 2007, Justice
Uthirapathy pronounced the verdict. Abdul Nassar Madhani
was acquitted for want or Damming evidences, to the shock
of blast victims and all the right thinking people. Basha,
Ansari and 158 others were found guilty while seven others
were acquitted along with Madhani. The sentences are
expected to be given from 6 th August onwards and 84
prisoners who were found guilty on non-serious charges were
also expected to get bail.

Abdul Nassar Madhani, who had been acquitted &amp; released,
was given a Hero's welcome in Thiruvananthapuram. Both the
UDF &amp; the LDF have vied with each other to take credit for
his acquittal. While the Communists, being the ruling
dispensation, could join the festivities at the
felicitation function, Congressmen could not join, as they
are the opposition. Madhani also assured his support for
the LDF government for the time being. As the Kerala
politicians were shamelessly painting him as a Good
Samaritan, Madhani was trying to project himself with a new
&amp; moderate image. He claimed that he had never been a
terrorist (!) and his future plan is to work for the
welfare of Dalits &amp; Muslims. He had clarified that he would
not sue the TN government for detaining him in the prisons
for nine long years, but warned that he would take up the
case again if Tamil Nadu goes for an appeal.

When their Kerala counterparts are going berserk on
Madhani's release, the Communists &amp; the Congressmen of
Tamil Nadu are maintaining a deadly silence on the court
verdict in general and Madhani's release in particular. The
other political parties including the DMK, which flaunt
their love for &quot;Tamil&quot; people in the name of &quot;Tamil&quot;, have
not reacted at all on the court verdict. Even the AIADMK,
which did well in crushing Islamic terrorism &amp; refusing to
be lenient on Madhani when in power, was conspicuous by its
silence on the verdict. None of the 'Tamil' political
leaders has come out with a clear statement on the verdict
on Coimbatore blasts to the dismay &amp; disappointment of the
Tamils.

The 1998 serial blasts have taken the lives of 59 innocent
&quot;Tamils&quot; and maimed over 200 innocent &quot;Tamils&quot; for life.
The families of the victims have been suffering in silence.
Abdul Nassar Madhani, the 'kingpin' of the conspiracy &amp;
crime has been acquitted and all the shameless &quot;Tamil&quot;
politicians, who brazenly claim to work for the welfare of
&quot;Tamils&quot; and serve the cause of &quot;Tamil&quot;, are simply keeping
quiet, just for the sake of Muslim votes! The BJP is the
only party, which is making the right noises and
unfortunately it doesn't have a presence at all in the
state. Worse is the statement of &quot;Tamil&quot; Nationalist Party
leader Pazha Nedumaran, who has demanded compensation for
terrorist Madhani. What a love for &quot;Tamils&quot;!

At least now, the Tamils must understand the brazen double
standards and the dubious intentions of the &quot;Tamil&quot;
politicians and realize that they have been cheated and
taken for a solid ride for the last forty years by the
Dravidian rulers by keeping them 'backward' perennially
through 'quotas' &amp; 'freebies'. The people of Tamil Nadu
must understand that, more than the 'Tamil' cause, it is
the 'Minority' cause, which the &quot;Tamil&quot; politicians are
bothered about.

In this kind of a scenario, if the Tamils expect that their
&quot;Tamil&quot; Chief minister would opt for an appeal against the
acquittal of Madhani, then they are quite wrong.
Karunanidhi being a shrewd politician, knows pretty well
that the people have the habit of forgetting things and
that he can always fool them with freebies and quotas in
the name of social welfare and social justice. He is also
aware of the fact that no other party is there in the state
to cash in on the Coimbatore blasts and that no other party
would demand the state government to go for an appeal,
except the BJP, which is not a force to reckon with in
Tamil Nadu.

But, what about the great Basha and others? The 'minority'
loving Chief Minister cannot afford to detain Basha and his
accomplices for many more years in prison. It doesn't
matter, the law can always take its 'course' and higher
courts are also there. As all culprits cannot be acquitted
in one go, loose arguments can be managed further at the
higher courts to effect the acquittal of Basha &amp; Co or
their sentences could be reduced and by that time, the
people would forget the past.

Cheers to Dravidianism, Minorityism and Secularism! May
Tamils be doomed!
