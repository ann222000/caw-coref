We've got a bit of a slow drip coming from our stopcock which is as old as
the house - about 30 years. So it looks like it needs replacing.

Could anyone please advise how bad a job it is to have replaced? The part
itself is quite accessible but do we need to get the water company in to
shut off the mains etc?

Our water company did ours for a fixed price of £79.95 about four or
five years ago. They handled all the details.

Took the guy about 3.5 hours as it turned out to be tricky. It may be
worth seeing if your water company do something similar (ours is Mid
Kent Water)

Which part of it is leaking?

You should be able to shut off the mains yourself at the company's
main stop cock. If it's their main stopcock which is leaking, then
it's their responsibility to repair it.

Easy enough if you can turn off the main stopcock outside.

If not, pipe freezer kits work very well - follow the instructions to the
letter.

It seems to be dripping from where the main shaft of the handle goes into
the main unit...if that makes any sense.

I'm sure that's true, but they may have a separate 'arm' that does
plumbing work.

Gland needs repacking.

MAY pe possible to o it without turning it off at all, if there is

As already mentioned, repacking the stuffing would fix this.

Other options are to just try tightening up the stuffing gland
a bit (the nut the shaft comes out of). This will also make
the tap tighter, and if you can't stop the leak this way without
the tap becoming too tight, then abandon this.

Another option is to buy a new tap and swap the tops around, if
they have the same main body thread (need to turn off the water
first). I've done this with taps which were over 50 years old,
but couldn't find matching ones for 100 year old taps.

Take out a household plumbing insurance with Homeserve
http://www.homeserve.com/about-us then wait a month or two before making a
claim (use a can under the leak in the meantime).  I'm sure this policy
would cover a leaking internal stopcock.  It only costs £1.66 a month.  I
have this cover and also sewerage &amp; electrical cover.  Recently my drains
were blocked and they sent in a specialist company who cleared the blockage
for free.  Homeserve are extremely efficient and even offered to arrange for
my drain clearance at 6pm.

Please remember this is only a suggestion and I would definitely not suggest
any form of misuse or fraud against any insurance company.  It's entirely up
to you whether to take out such a policy.

Hmmm, that's interesting. I have British Gas's plumbing and drains cover and
it states that the stopcock isn't covered. With the Homeserve cover it looks
like they do cover it.

If it is just leaking from the 'packing gland', i.e 'where the stem of
the valve disappears into the body of the valve through a brass nut'
it is a simple job as long as you can undo this nut. Other posters
have described the way to do it. Undo the nut with a suitable spanner,
not mole grips, slide it back up the stem. Get some PTFE tape, wind a
few turns round the stem and then push the nut down and tighten up.
You might have to do it a couple of times to get the amount of PTFE
right. All the packing glands of my manual Rad Valves have leaked at
some time. All get the same treatment. Due to the low friction of the
PTFE Tape never had to do them again.

Can you locate the mains stopcock to your property - it could be on the
pavement outside your house, or, by sod's law, in the middle of the road.
Then you would need some sort of special tool to close it (bear in mind that
it probably hasn't been touched for 30 years!).  Freezing is a possibility
if you have access to the main feed pipe.  Mine is buried under the concrete
floor, so I would have to excavate.  If you take the freezing route, make
sure that you have at least two freezing kits available, and also all the
necessary parts and tools - you will have limited time!  Why not just pay a
plumber or take out insurance and let a professional take the risks,
otherwise you could flood your house.  Bear in mind that mains water could
be up to 1 bar pressure and a flow of about 9 litres/minute.

You are only freezing a small section of pipe so the expansion isn't great
enough to do any damage.

The expansion goes along the pipe rather than outwards.
