*A Lesson on Geometry*
************ ********* ******

There was once a poor widow who, through great hardship, was struggling to
bring up her only son. As she realized that he was her only hope for the
future, she appointed a tutor for him although she would sometimes have to
borrow the money to pay for the tuition fees.

Once, after being promoted to class VII, the boy was being taught Geometry
by the teacher in English. As soon as the boy read out loud, Let ABC be a
triangle, the boy?s mother rushed into the classroom and screamed at the
teacher thus :

This boy is supposed to be advancing in his studies after being raised to
class VII, but you are still teaching him ABC - he learned all this when he
was an infant - and to think I am paying you 10 rupees a month! From today
you are no longer required here. You are only fit for teaching a primary
school if all you can teach is ABC!

The widow?s outburst was so violent that it left no scope for the teacher to
argue and he was compelled to leave the place.

*PURPORT*
************
The arguments put forward by persons desiring other than Krishna
consciousness, along with the karmis, jnanis, yogis, ascetics and the like,
including so-called religious communities, are similar to those expressed by
the widow. They say, We have become totally worthless through serving all
the time in this world. This sort of slave-like mentality is the root cause
of all troubles. If we were to accept servitude even after entering into the
domain of religion, and to serve Godhead in complete servitude even after
liberation, then how will we advance? Only when we are ignorant, and
conditioned under illusion, then our slave mentality is intensified. But
upon liberation, the realization aham brahmasi that I am Brahman should be
developed. Upon listening to such an argument, pure devotees will argue that
devotion or service to Godhead is the eternal position of all conscious
living entities. Such devotion, when cultivated through different stages of
performing devotional service (sadhana bhakti), ecstatic devotion (bhava
bhakti), and loving devotion (prema bhakti) , confirms verily the eternal
utility of devotion itself.

Servitude to Lord Krishna while performing devotional activities is known as
sadhana bhakti (performing devotion), whereas intimate servitude or service
to Sri Krishna, after liberated realization, is prema bhakti (loving
devotion). Service to Godhead in the liberated stage is irresistible service
(apratihata seva).

A,B,C,D or ka-kha-ga-gha may be practiced while learning the alphabet on the
elementary level; then again even after becoming the topmost man of letters,
one has to cultivate the variegated ness and artistic delicacy of that very
alphabet.

Those who are impersonalists, speculate just like the widow as narrated in
this story, advocating that A,B,C,D should only be practiced by children in
the elementary level and that these letters are of no use to any learned
person.

It is not that servitude to Sri Krishna should be offered only during
devotional performance, but it must be renewed even upon attaining
perfection through liberation as service to Lord Krishna is our eternal
profession. Servitude or service offered to Lord Krishna is our eternal
profession. Servitude or service offered to Lord Krishna after attaining the
stage of liberation is to be considered as real and the most perfect form of
service. Servitude to illusion (Maya) and servitude to Lord Sri Krishna
should never be considered equal.

*The Exploding Frog*
************ ********* **
There was once a frog that lived in a pond. One day, her son happened to see
an elephant near a tank. The baby frog returned to it?s mother and
enthusiastically told her, Mother, today I saw a huge animal!

The mother frog asked, Really? How big was the animal?

The baby frog replied, Oh, it was much bigger than you are.

The frog puffed up her body and asked, This much bigger?

The baby replied, Oh no, much bigger.

The mother puffed up her body more and asked, Even this much bigger?

Her child replied, No, no mother, much bigger than that.

In this way the mother frog gradually puffed up her body more and more and
each time the baby-frog would continue to tell her, much bigger, much
bigger.

Finally, while trying to puff up her body beyond limit, the frog?s belly
exploded with a big bang.

*PURPORT*
***********

The insignificant living entities who consider themselves as para-brahma
(para = supreme, brahma = Absolute Being), or as if nothing is equal to or
greater than themselves in spite of the fact that they?re simply
misconceived insignificant entities constitutionally engaged in devotional
service, take a fancy to be equal in perfection with a liberated soul. They
are usually destroyed like a puffed-up frog due to their false ego.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said :

jnani jivanmukta dasa painu kari mane /

vastutah buddhi suddha nahe krsna-bhakti vine //

mayadhisa mayavasa, isvare jive bhed /

hena jive isvara-sah kaha ta? abhed //

prabhu kahe-visnu visnu iha na kahiva /

jivahame ?krsna?-jnan kobhu na koriva //

sannyasi - cit-kana jiva, kirana-kana- sama /

sadoisvaryapuna krsna hoy suyopama //

jiva, isvara-tattva- kobhu nahe ?sama? /

jvaladagnirasi jaiche sphulingera ?kana? //

jei mudha kahe, -jiva isvara hoy ?sama? /

sei ta? ?pasandi? hoy, dande tare yama //

There are many philosophical speculators ( jnanis) belonging to the Mayavada
school who consider themselves liberated and call themselves Narayana.
However their intelligence is not purified unless they engage in Krsna?s
devotional service. (Caitanya -caritamrta - Madhya Lila 24.29)

The Lord is the master of the potencies, and the living entity is the
servant of them. That is the difference between the Lord and the living
entity. However, you declare that the Lord and the living entities are one
and the same. (Cc - Madhya Lila 6.162)

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu immediately exclaimed, Visnu! Visnu! Do not call Me
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A jiva cannot become Krsna at any time.
Do not even say such a thing!

A sannyasi in the renounced order is certainly part and parcel of the
complete whole, just as a shining molecular particle of sunshine is part and
parcel of the sun itself. Krsna is like the sun, full of six opulence's, but
the living entity is only a fragment of the complete whole.

A living entity and the Absolute Personality of Godhead are never to be
considered equal, just as a fragmental spark can never be considered the
original flame. ( Cc - Madhya Lila 18.111-113 )

A foolish person who says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the
same as the living entity is an atheist, and he becomes subject to
punishment by the superintendent of death, Yamaraja. (Cc - Madhya Lila
18.115)

*N.B. *By narrating this fable of the exploding frog, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada used to instruct that it is better to be a good
man than to be a big one. I am Brahaman, I am siddha , I am Vaisnava , I am
pandita , I am self - realized - this sort of false ego is the root cause of
the fallen entities? bondage. One who is enlightened with pure devotion for
Sri Hari, never conceives himself to be the lord of this material nature or
the enjoyer of this material world, as a great worker, a great preacher, and
the like. Such a person should realize himself as insignificant as eternal
dust-particles under the feet of his spiritual master and of all the
Vaisnavas. He possesses a very candid humility all the time in his heart. A
living entity can never be para-brahma, just as Ravana can never be Lord Sri
Ramachandra.
