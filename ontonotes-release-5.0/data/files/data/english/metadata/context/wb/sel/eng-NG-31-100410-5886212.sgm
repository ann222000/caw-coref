When I moved my boat from Florida to Puget Sound, I had no use for the
air conditioning.  A couple of years ago I decided to simplify things
a bit, and ripped it out along with some other stuff.  Removing its
control panel left a sizeable and rather ragged hole in the cabinetry
near the sink.  My solution may suggest something that will solve a
problem for someone else.

After squaring up the hole, I bought a small piece of teak and cut it
to the size of the opening.  It was obvious that the gap between the
plug and the cabinet was never going to be sufficiently invisible, no
matter how much effort I put into fitting it.

To cover the gap, I used some of the scrap teak to make a frame for
the plug.  This starts to look pretty good, but when you've created a
picture frame it sort of begs to be filled with something more
interesting than a small teak panel.

I decided to turn it into a nameplate.  I scanned and cleaned up an
Allmand logo from the brochure, chose an interesting font from the
standard Windows selection, and came up with the design that you see
in the photo.  I used Visio, but any software that will let you
combine text and graphics, and either output or convert to a .JPG file
should do the job.

To burn it into the teak, I brought the file and the panel to the
local award &amp; trophy shop and had them engrave it (for $10) on their
laser plotter.  I used stain to darken up the engraving, and to
color-match the wood, which I finished with tung-oil varnish.  It
turned out to be a passable match for the decades-old teak-oil finish
on the cabinet.

I used super glue to bond the frame to the graphic panel and then hot
glue to bond the assembly into the hole in the cabinet.

There is probably something else that I should have used the time for,
but it was an interesting project with a good result.
