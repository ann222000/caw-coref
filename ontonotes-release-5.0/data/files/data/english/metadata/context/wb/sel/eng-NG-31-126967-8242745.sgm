I have predicted that not to long after the digital transition is over
in 2009 that Congresscritters or a Congresscritter might notice that
virtually no one is using digital channels 2-51.

And that this would lead to a proposal that these channel should be
taken from their current licensees and sold at auction. The idea of an
auction will be fresh in Congresscritters minds since they will have
just had one for channels 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66 and 67.
The billions they took in without having to vote for a tax will be very
fresh in their collective minds. (Google just promised at least $4.6
billion today).

With the arrival of figures showing that after the transition as few as
or less than ONE% of US households now depend on OTA....

With the fresh smell of money, $15 to $30 billion from the auctions of
60 MHz of BROADCAST TV spectrum in 2008....

And with the prospect of selling off the rest, 294 MHz of spectrum now
occupied by Cable money myopic broadcasters, now planted in their minds,
new age, those ushered in as the Republican party implodes,
Congresscritters will have a field day with the prospect.

And earlier than I expected it the press is starting to talk of just
this prospect.

And a related article about some of the corruption in broadcasting that
picks our pockets.

Broadcasters are going to loose their spectrum, all of it.

Didn't have to happen if they were a bit more hyperopia. If they had
been awake at the wheel when things like their DTV modulation
compression codec were being discussed.

Well, they don't care, do they?  What little effort any of the
networks exerts today on their OTA stuff is losing popularity, anyway.

Broadcast is almost dead, it'll all be on-demand via cable/internet in
twenty years.  OTA will just be for mobile and short-range hotspots.

Yessir, sonny, when I was a lad, there was free television.

Really, old dad?

Yes, kiddo, and music came on big, black disks, and video came on
tapes, and you had to plug your telephone into the wall to talk to
anybody. Then came global warming, and it all went away.

Congress _will_ be getting floods of phone calls from people around
Feb 18, 2009, complaining of TV sets not working.  In case you have
not attended any community meetings of Congress people (I have), the
majority, and in some cases the vast majority, are elderly in the
near and post retirement age.  These are the same ones that make up
the majority of letters written to Congress.

After having gotten that response around Feb 18, 2009, they will be
very much afraid of trying to take TV away in the post-transition era.
That's what it would mean.

And, like every single prediction you have made so far, you are wrong.

Please don't feel bad about this. Being 100% wrong is very difficult.
That you have kept this string going for years makes you the only
interweb kook that has consistently been wrong for this long.

Tholen, dank, [HAMMOND] and many others have made the mistake of being
right once (in a very great) while. You have miraculously avoided that
outcome.

No those millions of elderly people are going to be just out of luck

They are not going to have TV anymore. Congress has NO plan. If you
think they do go to the Communicators and listen to Congressman Fred
Upton who they interviewed today. He has no clue. He never had a clue.

When the transition comes you will find him hiding under a rock

That is my high estimate. I am talking about households that depend on
OTA and have no other source of TV. There will be many households that
have an antenna as a backup. Others who watch it sometimes or have it on
a TV in the kids room which they mostly use for games. ETC.

Most modulations that use COFDM are QAM.

And it has everything to do with the modulation. If the US had a decent
COFDM based QAM modulation there would be over 120 million OTA receivers
in use today in the US.

And I mean in use not stuck in the back of integrated HDTV sets sold to
unsuspecting customers who have no idea they bought such a thing as an
OTA receiver.

OTA would be wildly popular and would have promoted HD in the US and
around the world far more than the lack of OTA in the US has done.

Broadcasters would be DOING mobile TV not trying to fix 8-VSB so that
maybe they can do mobile someday. They would be doing mobile HD and ED
and SD. The US would be the leaders in OTA DTV not the basket case we are.

Retailers would be featuring OTA solutions both fixed and mobile. Just
like in other countries where OTA DTV is the fastest growing electronic
wonder ever. Cable and satellite would be under pressure from OTA
offerings just like they are in the UK, Germany and other countries.

Watcha talking about youngster?  Video came on film, not tape.  As for the
telephone, the phone company wired it in place never to be moved by you
except for the length of the wire.  Yu had to  talk to an operator to get
connected to your next door neighbor who just happened to have the same
number as you, but with a different letter at the end.  Your phone had one
ring and his phone had two rings, so you had to hang up while the operator
rang his phone.  Those were the days!  Then came private lines and dials and
push buttons and direct dialing and all went to blazes.  Global warming
wasn't even a phrase yet.

I'd love to go back to those days, but only if I could take my computer with
me!

If they do there will not be a problem. I don't think they will work.

This is not your engineer friend who is an early adopter who is willing
to do just about anything to get his OTA DTV to work. Mpt your rich
friend who can buy every new generation of OTA receiver. These will be
people who just want to watch TV.

They will hook up their converter box to their rabbit ears and if they
get reception they may not get all they channels they got before. They
may not get the ONE channel they want. If they get reception they may
get drop outs instead of snow.

Some will complain right away others later. Many will just go to cable
or satellite but will remember at the next election.

There will be a political price.

And then the media will wake up to just how bad the public has been had
by this transition. They will start looking at other countries and
wonder why they not only don't have this problem but also have a vibrant
rapidly growing OTA DTV experience.

They *may* not get all the channels that they got before.  Of course,
they may get MORE CHANNELS than they got before.  Often folks using rabbit
ears have some channels they get but are so ghost ridden they don't watch
them.  Those are likely to come in perfectly.

Living partly shielded by hills, many of my analog signals are poor to
unwatchable.  The digital versions are perfect.

Your speculations is nothing more -- just speculation without evidence.

Despite the fact that Bob 'zeal&quot; sometimes gets in the way of his
arguments - he is, and has been , mostly correct.

Its unfortunate, as OTA HD , with a good outside antenna is
wonderfully.

Problem is, hardly anybody has an outside antenna anymore - just
wander around your neighborhood, and tell me what percent of the homes
have roof top antennas?

Like Bob says - the american sheeple have not got a clue about the
ATSC tuner built into their new chinese made flat panel TV. They hook
it up to the cable TV box and wonder at the joys of a great big blurry
picture.

OTA will be making a comeback.  A clean solid picture has always been so

difference.  Sure some locations _will_ need a directional UHF antenna.
But this gets you HD or solid pictures or alternate programs cheaper
and sooner than cable is managing to do.

Land can be taken by eminent domain, even when the purpose is to enhance

the original action of selling, rather than leasing, the spectrum is not
even legal (because it is a rare resource and not literally owned by
those who were selling it).  If this is overturned, they most certainly
would have to give the money back, with interest.

Selling spectrum was definitely wrong.  We'll learn that in the future
when the government discovers it has no continuing revenue stream from it.

No.  You want to own a piece of it for yourself for your mobile services.

Except in the hinterlands and more challenging areas for reception,
you can't really judge OTA ATSC reception by number of roof top
antennas. With analog, you generally wanted the best possible signal,
which meant at even medium range distances, you would go with a rooftop
antenna. But with digital, so long as the signal strength is good enough
for stable reception, you can use a attic or indoor antenna. As long you
are far enough above the minimum signal strength for reception to
maintain reception for the stations you want to get for bad weather or
changing seasons, you are set.

I have a Channel Master 4221 4 Bay bowtie and a CM pre-amp in the
attic of my townhouse. If you walked by, you would have no clue that I
had an antenna setup which picks up stations in DC at 16 miles,
Baltimore stations at 43 miles, and a few other stations in other
directions, including one at 48 miles. I could probably get a couple of
more minor stations if I put the antenna up on the roof with a rotator.
But I have a 3 story townhouse and the roof is way up there with no
chimney to use for bracing. I have thought about putting the CM 4221 up
on the roof, along with a Winegard YA6713 upper VHF antenna to prepare
for the more distant local stations switching to upper VHF in 2009. But
I would have to spend money on a professional installer and would have
to deal with occasional maintenance issues. So I'm sticking with the
attic for now.

Lower profile antenna are also popular that mount on the side of the
house. These may be mounted on the backside or a side of the house that
is not visible or obvious from the street. Some of these low profile
antennas are not very good and are overpriced, but if they are good
enough to get a stable signal, then they are good enough for the job at
hand.

Despite what Bob may think, stats from a major survey done for the FCC
several years ago showed that around 15% of households that have TVs are
OTA only. But there are also many millions of households who have cable
or satellite, that also have TVs in the kitchen, bedrooms, other rooms
that have OTA only for that TV. They use cable or satellite for the main
TV or TVs only and don't bother with a cable run or STB for some or all
of their secondary TVs.

No, free OTA is not going to go away. The NAB has made it's big
concession to give up UHF 52 to 69. They and the OTA public have enough
points &amp; pull with congress to keep VHF 7 to UHF 51 for decades to come.
Low VHF 2 to 6 may go away or be consolidated to several channels at
some point because of few stations using those channels. But low VHF
with 3 to 5 meter wavelengths is not nearly as valuable for auction and
portable communications as the upper UHF channels.

Pass the word. ATSC 8-VSB works quite well despite what you may read
from one borderline/obsessed personality who posts here with the initial
of BM.

Bob, you ignoring slut.  Unklike Jane Curtin who was an ignorant slut,
Bob keeps ignoring the fact that 8VSB is the law and my reception is
GREAT.  Every week or so, he tells us how bad it's gonna be.

Now I may be in the minority, but when I saw how goooood OTA HDTV was,
I dumped cable.  I'm not alone.  Many people are reverting to OTA.
It's not a stampede, but with HD cable costing $1000 a year (with no
premium channels), some people are returning to OTA.  OK, I don't get
ESPN, but I don't care about sports.  I do miss some of the additional
programming on LIFE, AMC, TNT, etc, but it's not worth $1000 a year.

Why?   Because commercial advertisers on OTA will start pulling in a

8VSB is working well for me.  I live south of San Diego and I regularly get
OTA DTV from Los Angeles, 124 miles distant.  Yesterday, I got KCBS-DT on a
rusty, old 2-bay bowtie in the eaves of my garage.  The garage is on the
south side of the house, so the Ch. 60 signal had to get around the house
and pass through the garage wall to get to the antenna.  The antenna frame
has four little feet on it and it's designed to sit on or near the TV it
serves.

With some freezes and tiling, it was crappy reception, to be sure -- that
little antenna usually serves me only for my &quot;locals&quot; and I was just goofing
around when KCBS-DT (ERP = 469 KW) appeared.  I expect to have to use my
roof-mounted yagi for the LA stations.

My point is this:  My vintage tuner locked a far-fringe signal received on a
pathetic antenna near ground level with an abundance of multipath riding on
it.  Frankly, I don't see the problem.

Sorry I fall into the trap of saying they are selling it because the

Unfortunately because the current broadcasters have been delaying the
transitions with things like 8-VSB, we have not been able to use our
spectrum. And we were not able to raise the money to buy far more since
the date of the transition was very risky in 2002. Now that the date
looks very certain we have competition from firms like Google that
promised to spend at least 4.6 billion on just 22 MHz.

The same spectrum went for pennies in earlier auctions of channels 54,
55 and 59. Total take was $147 million I think.

You are right OTA will be around forever but the present setup for
channels 2-51, free OTA as we have known it will die within a few years
of this transition IMO.

Disagree, it is ALL because of the differences in technical
characteristics. If a COFDM modulation had been allowed in 2000,
virtually every US home would already have purchased freely an STB,
converter, USB receiver or integrated DTV device, portable or in house
by now.

We had a four year head start on the UK and the UK has sold over 20
million OTA receivers in a nation of 25 million households and the UK
DOES NOT EVEN HAVE THE DRAW THAT HD BRINGS TO THE EQUATION.

If you believe in HD then you must agree that the UK would have done far
better if they had HD than SD and they have done very well.

Not only that but in the UK you have to pay for FREEVIEW DTV. Quite a
lot in fact and still they have sold 20 million OTA receivers in a
nation of 25 million homes.

In the US we would have done far better, faster and we had far more
time. Virtually everyone in the US would already have an DTV OTA
receiver, Cable and satellite would be reeling and their prices would be
lower and your IPhone would offer HD on screen, by heads up display or

I was wrong? I have said from the beginning that 8-VSB will be
receivable in 70% of cases as was demonstrated by the test of 2000. And
with better receivers it will do even better than that. Is that good
enough when there are far better modulations that virtually guarantee
good reception for everyone if we build out modern broadcast networks?

No it is not and those that will be free to use the best codecs and
modulation will show that in coming years marginalizing the broadcasters
on 2-51.

OK your happy with that and you get decent OTA reception like maybe 70%
plus will with 8-VSB and better receivers.

But many are not getting that good reception and many want other
channels that you can live without.

OTA could have provided all those channels if the broadcast network was
properly designed with a modern codec and modulation.

You would not have to give up anything and you could get it in your car
or boat.

What exactly is it that you get from 8-VSB that makes all those
sacrifices necessary? Why does the US have to give up half the carrying
capacity of the spectrum and fiddle with special antennas and rotors
when you don't have to?

How are you going to feel about the fact that lots of broadcast TV will
be sold to you over spectrum taken from broadcasters, channels above 51,
and they will only need antennas that fit in cell phones or laptops and
those antennas work everywhere?

What do we get for having to mess with inferior s**t?

Tell me what is it? If there is some offsetting benefit for using an
inferior codec and modulation OK. I don't know of any.

Freeview does however carry the option of being able to upgrade to something
called Top-up TV, which if the receiver is equipped with a card slot means
that for around £7.00 a month one can also subscribe to a variety of extra

There was also talk of Sky (Rupert Murdoch) who owns three of the channels

will not only give him extra channel capacity but also of course would mean
that subscribers would have to purchase a completely new receiver.

However I can't see the powers that be allowing that, but perhaps they want
to sow a little bit of uncertainty, especially AIUI now that Freeview take

There could always be something better in the future.  If we followed

Comcast.  Before that a few other various companies.

Right now, about 4 channels are messed up.  Fortunately I got that on
channels I don't really watch.  If I were to call, they'd send a tech

else instead.  So at the moment I will leave well enough alone until
other routine maintenance breaks something I want to watch.

They most certainly do not have fiber feeds for most local channels here.
I am watching their analog signals and I see frequency digital blocking
breakup during bad weather on some of the channels.  So they appear to be
taking the digital signals and converting back to analog in these cases.
In one instance when a local network affiliate went out, I tuned in when
they were resetting the receiver and I watched all the menus they went
through for about a half-hour trying to get the picture size conversion
done right (that channel was going to carry the Indy 500, had been dead
for 2 days straight, and they managed to get it fixed 1 hour before the
race, after I called about a dozen times trying to insist to the CSRs that
it was a problem on their end and that I did not want a tech to come visit
the day after the race).

Cable was out for 2 hours again last night with no weather situation at
all that could cause it.  Maybe an accident took out a pole?  It is a
monthly (on average) or worse situation.  Comcast service here is shit.
The only reason I don't jump to satellite is I have to have an STB to use
that service.  I may end up doing so anyway.

But as I pointed out the system of paying for a radio/TV licence has been in

adjusted in any way to pay for Freeview, although I believe that there were
some calls (happily resisted) for this to happen just after Freeview's
launch.

&gt;&gt; OK your happy with that and you get decent OTA reception like maybe 70%
&gt;&gt; plus will with 8-VSB and better receivers.

&gt;&gt; But many are not getting that good reception and many want other
&gt;&gt; channels that you can live without.

&gt;&gt; OTA could have provided all those channels if the broadcast network was
&gt;&gt; properly designed with a modern codec and modulation.

&gt;   No, it couldn't.

&gt;   Those things don't change the Shannon-Hartley theorem (&quot;Shannon's law&quot;)
&gt; of information theory.
">

If properly designed the TV spectrum, channels 2-51 could compete very
well with cable and satellite. Using the right codec you can deliver a
lot more than is being delivered with MPEG2. Delivering to DVR's can
open up 24/7 delivery of programming.

When you dissect what cable offers there is a lot of junk and redundancy.

OTA can also go where cable and satellite cannot.

Done right it is not even a contest. OTA wins as it is in many countries
today.

&gt;&gt; You would not have to give up anything and you could get it in your car

What is not possible?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What exactly is it that you get from 8-VSB that makes all those
&gt;&gt; sacrifices necessary? Why does the US have to give up half the carrying
&gt;&gt; capacity of the spectrum and fiddle with special antennas and rotors
&gt;&gt; when you don't have to?

&gt;   Because carrying capacity is not a fixed value.  You claim there is
&gt; more carrying capacity, but you give up noise resistance to get there.
">

COFDM was/is able to operate at a higher datarate mobile than 8-VSB is
able to handle fixed. This was demonstrated to Congress in 2000. DVB-T
COFDM mobile at 19.76 Mbps using and omni antenna for reception while
8-VSB was restricted to 19.34 Mbps using a directional antenna.

And even then the 8-VSB advocates were terrified that they were going to
lose reception.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How are you going to feel about the fact that lots of broadcast TV will
&gt;&gt; be sold to you over spectrum taken from broadcasters, channels above 51,
&gt;&gt; and they will only need antennas that fit in cell phones or laptops and
&gt;&gt; those antennas work everywhere?

&gt;   Small antennas work fine when the transmitter is around the corner.

&gt;   How many transmitter sites are you willing to put up?  Those things
&gt; get expensive, especially when the neighbors object.  Remember, they
&gt; think that cell sites within a few blocks of a school are hazardous
&gt; to their children's health, and will fight you putting up any transmitter
&gt; in the area.
">

More transmitter sites cost less, are far more reliable, self healing
and would not have gone off the air in 2001 when their only transmitter
was taken down. With multiple transmitter sites you can use reliable
solid state transmitters at very low power settings and you are not
restricted to using the highest point on the landscape. You can bargain
for much smaller spaces with multiple landlords or tower operators.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What do we get for having to mess with inferior s**t?

&gt;&gt; Tell me what is it? If there is some offsetting benefit for using an
&gt;&gt; inferior codec and modulation OK. I don't know of any.

&gt;   There could always be something better in the future.  If we followed
&gt; that principle, we would still be watching monochrome television, never
&gt; having adopted a color system.
">

No if we follow that principle we would be far more up to date today
than yesterday.

But we DO follow that principle when it comes to cable and satellite.
They are free to change their modulation or codec whenever it makes
business sense to do it or competitive pressures dictate it. They are
not wedded to an archaic technology for an indefinite future.

We talk free market until it comes to DTV then we talk of regulation in
its worst form. Mandates that force the public to buy something they
don't want or need for some BS reason that makes NO sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   Instead, we chose the best system available now, and we have high definition
&gt; color that has much better performance than the NTSC systems provided.
">

No we ram through the worst system in a hurry to satisfy the short term
interest of ignorant CE manufacturers and in the end they lose also.
OTA with 8-VSB did not deliver the supposed windfall of excess profits
from the sale of HDTV sets.

The major driver of HDTV set sales was DVD's, flat screen technology
that allowed you to hang the TV on the wall, keeping up with the Joneses
and a number of other things.

OTA was and is NOT in the top ten on that list.

If anything the problems that OTA DTV has had over the last 9 years held
back HD both here and in the rest of the world.

You are aware that the tax money received by PBS
has been drastically reduced over the years, yes?
Probably not, since you are stupid enough to keep
coming back here spewing your nonsense about how
your modulation scheme is better than any other.
How much money did you lose when we chose 8-VSB?

&gt;I don't know what cable system you're using, but I've had clean solid

&gt;In fact, for local stations the cable companies get fiber feeds directly
&gt;from the studios.  They don't just put up a $20 antenna and re-feed that
&gt;to their subscribers.

The analog cable quality really isn't a function of the front end feed
- its a function of the connection to your house.

In my neighborhood the analog cable is atrocious - ghosts, static, you
name it.

Its why I went with Direct TV - and now have a rock steady ghost free,
highly over compressed and macro blocking &quot;all digital&quot; picture,,lol

I do not think once they sell the spectrum, they get any continuing

Which is good, because they are running such huge budget surpluses,

I clearly typed &quot;roof top&quot; - as a benchmark as to how many of your
neighbors are watching OTA DTV.

What does only requiring indoor antennas have to do with that?

Yes there are &quot;millions&quot; of happy OTA DTV viewers - out a a market of
100s of millions.

Do the math.

I wish there was 80 channels of decent content on my Direct TV.
