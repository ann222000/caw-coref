Nope. You can't compare natural erosion by surface runoff and grountable
water weathering to the process of quarrying the limestone, manual
stirring of the rubbles in water combined to a few sundry/soaing cycles.
The human intervention in the process is decisive.

And when you quarry that soft limestone, you can easily get rubbles not

&gt; I'm sorry.... what is it you do not understand by this: &quot;The major
&gt; properties of the fraction consisting of clay minerals&quot;? The &quot;fraction
&gt; consisting of clay minerals&quot; is the clay fraction.
">

The full quote in Gauri (1984) is:

"Non-Carbonate Clastic Fraction. The major properties of the fraction
consisting of clay minerals is revealed by the x-ray diffraction
spectra. The 20, 5-15% reflections indicate a large d-spacings in the
range of 5 to 15A which are characteristic of clay minerals. The
identification of individual clay minerals is permitted by the following
data."

Here I understand that the whole clastic fraction contain clay minerals
that he further analyzed by XRD. Weird that he does not mention quartz
at all if, according to your interpretation, it constitutes 3.5 to 25%
of the stone while Clays minerals are less than 1%.
As you mention somewhere else, that would barely make it an argilleceous
limestone while it is largely refered as a clayed, marly limestone (ok
not a marl, but containing lot of clastic material), with relatively
impermeable bed (permeability is due to macroporosity).

Then in 1999, he says "Quartz particles and clay minerals are the major
clastic particles present". It's weird to qualify clay minerals as a
"major clastic particle present" if it does not weight much compared to
quartz.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Clay minerals are
&gt; not sand- and silt-sized particles in the clastic fraction. They are
&gt; clay-sized particles.
">

You perfectly know that the silt-clay fractionning is a classification
according to granulometry. Fine silt can be constituted by clay
minerals. If you refer to chapter 2.2.3.1 (Gauri 1999) the sample is
washed with distilled water after the dissolution of calcite, and no
calgon is added to prevent the flocculation of clays.

Moreover, in contrary to your claim it is not unusual to find silt-size
particles containing clay minerals. For example in:
I. A. Verkhovets, N. P. Chizhikova and A. S. Vladychenskii,
Mineralogical composition of silt fractions and its transformation under
the impact of different cenoses in model lysimeters, (2006) Eurasian
Soil Science, 39, 528-538.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; period!!!
">

Not yet.

I tried to contact Gauri but I did not get any reply yet. Though, I got
answers from Davidovits, Aigner and Harrell.

Of course, Davidovits stand by his own analysis of quarry samples.

You'll love Harrell's answer. I hope he won't mind if I post it here:
"I have seen the Barsoum paper, and I and with others are now preparing
a rebuttal. There is no truth to Barsoum's (or Davidovit's) claim that
the pyramids are built with concrete. We are quite certain that they
are, if fact, built with blocks of limestone. Now to your questions. The
"silt" that Gauri et al. report from the Giza limestone is silt-size
(between 0.062 and 0.004 mm) grains of mostly quartz and only
occasionally other silicate minerals like feldspar. Their "clay" refers
to clay minerals and these are very rare in the limestone. In fact, none
of the Giza limestones or, for that matter, no limestone anywhere else
in Egypt, will disaggregate in water. "

No surprise, he shares your interpretation of the data presented by
Gauri and he probably refers to the experiment he made trying to
disintegrate Gebel Mokkatam limestone in water as reported in his paper.
Of course this rock was different than the one found in the Wadi.
I can't wait for his rebuttal. Ma be you will be one of the authors,
after all.

The answer from Aigner is probably the best one: "Certainly more work
would be needed to clarify this."

Indeed.

Yes they are different... but in a natural situation the rock still
get soaked, they still dry out, and if they are an outcrop or close to
the surface they have a potentially for exposure to the sun as well.
So one would expect them to have some weathering on their exposed
surfaces due to this claimed weathering mechanism, if it ever existed,
which should increased erosion rates in those rocks susceptible to it.
The morphology of the outcrop should reflect this behavior... it does
not.

I think you need to re-understand the implication of that NOVA
experiment conducted by Davidovits. If the NOVA experiment was a real
representation of the rock's behavior there is absolutely no reason
why it will not occur to some degree in the natural situation where
the rocks get soaked by standing water and dry out after it drains
away. Davidovits' website has claimed that a chunk of limestone taken
from a quarry "very easily disaggregate..." and "After 24 hour soaking
in a plastic bag with water, the limestone chunk separated into clay
and mummulites." (see link below). Morris (1993) claims that it was
soaked overnight. If you want to claim these rocks are impermeable to
water over thousands of years of repeated periodic exposure.... then
they are not going to suddenly start disaggregate in water because one
soaks them overnight or whatever. In that plastic bag one would think
they don't just soak for 24 hours overnight and than suddenly "poof"
they disaggregate before ones eyes like a magic trick set to a timer.
If these claims of Davidovits are the case then anytime the rocks get
soaked under natural conditions the rock's surface should disaggregate
to some degree and erode or be weakened and become more susceptible to
weathering and erosion with the next soaking. You can't have it both
ways... impermeable to water then suddenly highly susceptible to it...
take your pick which one you want to go with and we will continue the
discussion from there.

Clay disperses in water. That's not new. You constantly ignore that the
physical parameters in a bedrock (especially the pressure) are
completely different than rubbles. When you change the condition, you
change the groundstate of the matter. When rubbles of crumbly limestone
are stirred in water, it transform into a slurry with the help of sme
weathring mechanism. One may also wonder what is the impact of NaOH,
involved in the geopolymerization process, on the integrity of a crumbly
limestone.

Let's agree to disagree on this point. Moreover, it's propably much more
important to refer to a sand/silt/clay analysis of the limestone from
the Wadi? I never found one. Did you find one?

I have another question. Davidovits and yourself  focuse on the content
of clay minerals to eventually explain it can disintegrate with litle
effort using wet/dry cycles. But independantly to the clay mineral
content, does the fact that the rock contains a lot of silt is not
sufficient to make it very crumbly. In addition the salt weathering is
certainly significant during the wet/dry cycles. So is that clay mineral
content very important?

Not at all. Salt were not removed in this particular experiment.
Here is the whole paragraph:
"A sample rock weighing nearly 50 g is digested in glacial acteic acid.
Stonger acids, such as hydrochloric acid, may also be used to dissolve
the sample, but there is a likelihood that the structure of the clay
mineral may be disrupted in the process. To accelerate digestion in
acetic acid air may be periodically drawn out of the flask using a
vaccuum pump. To dissolve the entire carbonate portion of the sample,
several days are needed during which the acid is replenished
periodically after effervescence subsides and the supernatant is
carefully removed. The insoluble residue residue is then washed in
distilled water and dried. The dry matter is placed on a 230 mesh screen
in order to seprate the sand fraction from silt and clay: the latter
pass through the screen.
Water is added to the silt and clay fraction, and the mixture is
agitated and then allowed to stay for nearly 6 hours, during which most
of the silt settles out. The suspended matter is siphoned out and
treated with a saturated solution of sodium chloride in which the clay
minerals flocculate and are able to settle from the suspension".

You must concede that salts were not removed and no hexametaphosphate
was added to disperse the clay minerals. So the silt fraction in table
9.2 may contain substential amount of clay minerals.

There is very little pressure on the exposed surfaces of the vertical

pushing the rocks out into the exposed area of weathering for the
opened joints). See the eroded solution widened joints on the surfaces
of the Sphinx enclosure below if you do not understand what these are.
Nor is there any pressure on the shallow drainage ditch on the floor
of the Sphinx enclosure made of layer 1i. Neither of these show a
natural version of the claimed extreme behavior that the NOVA "bag of
water" exhibits even though they have been exposed to standing water
periodically for hundred to thousands of years. These natural examples
also included exposure to the completely unnecessary drying cycle that
was apparently never preformed in the NOVA experiment to cause
complete disaggregation of a test sample.

If it occurs in "rubbles" than there is absolutely no reason why an

natural weathering, weathering rates, geologic time, or the
susceptibility of rock-exposed surfaces to the natural version (which

The rocks do not appear to be susceptible to this proposed rapid
weathering mechanism in a natural situation over a vast geologic
timescale to periodic and long term exposure to standing water on
exposes surfaces of solution widened joints even in the beds that are
claimed to be clay rich and highly susceptible to it. When exposed to
water the rocks are clearly susceptible to solution structures, but
you claim not to clay hydration (a natural weathering mechanism)....

"Dilute acetic acid was chosen so that any phosphate or clay mineral

misplaced the quotation accidentally in your snippet. You will notice
that calcite is still present, even after 2 hours of exposure to 10%
acetic acid. Which should give an indication why dilute HCL was used
in rocks by Gauri for the clastic fraction separation.

So far you have given no answer that demonstrates the validity of your

you continue to asset that they are undetectable in the silt fraction

So let's make a summary.
In 1984, Gauri wanted to answer a simple question: What is main cause of
the weathering of the Sphinx? So he looked first at the soluble salts by
leaching a first sample and he found a lot of salts (1.2 to 5%).
Then he looked at the nature of the clay minerals to check if there was
swelling clays (Halloysite and smectites). He took another sample and
crushed it to a 300 mesh powder, digested it with 10% AcOH for 2 hours
(short time), and collected the fine residue while in suspension on
filter papers. Is that the whole clastic fraction or just clays/fine
silt? Is there any sedimentation at this point or is everything in
suspension? Anyway, he analyzed that fine residue by XRD and he mainly
found kaolinite. No quartz at this point. But he got his answer: Not
much swelling clays.
In addition he shows a table giving Sand/Silt/Clays ratio, i. e.
granulometry clasification, which means that he separated the residues
by sieving.
How did he separate the clastic fraction from the carbonate fraction
before sieving? It is not described but there is absolutely no reason to
think that he used a different method to digest calcite than the one he
used to get the residue for the XRD, i. e., using AcOH.  In addition,
this method corresponds to the general method described in his 1999 book
except the incubation time and AcOH concentration (paragraph 2.2.3.1 see
full quote in &lt;1hs8jqh.l0je6jj75raeN%firstn ... @lastname.net&gt;)

In these conditions a significant portion of the clays flocculate
because the salts were not leached away and no hexametaphosphate was
added to the sample to disperse the clay before sieving. Therefore it is
likely that the silt fraction contains clay minerals.

In 1999, he goes further because he wants to analyze the separated
clay/silt/sand fractions. First he removes the water-soluble salts by
leaching, so that there is no clay floculation due to the presence of
large amount of salts in the sample. This time he uses HCl to digest the
carbonate fraction. He used diluted HCl in order to minimize clay
denaturation. Although he does not tell how long he incubates (the
longer the more likely clays minerals will be affected. Then he
separates the different fractions by sieving, and analyze each fraction
by XRD, using an oriented sample for the clay minerals (and a
glycolation treatment afterward). He sees Quartz only in the sand and
silt fraction. OK.
The whole separation and analysis methods is different from the one
presented in 1984. But the issue is that he shows the same table 2 from
the 1984 paper (now 9.2 in the 1999 book), to show the different ratios
between the sand/silt/fraction!
I'm sorry, but the methods being differents you cannot extrapolates that
the sand/silt/clay ratio are the same, especially when you consider the
the flocculation issue in the 1984 method.

So, table 9.2 is not relevant to the XRD analysis presented in the 1999
book.

need for these extra thing to be thrown in now. You have not
demonstrated anything that indicates the rocks of the quarries behave
the way you claim, just a single selected sample of detritus that is
not typical of the unweathered rocks in the quarry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I have no idea... certainly not long enough to leach away the clay
&gt;&gt;minerals since they were identified by XRD in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
&gt;&gt;(1999) from the dilute HCL separated clastic samples. Stop trying to
&gt;&gt;assert that Gauri does not know what he is doing when he is testing
&gt;&gt;his samples... your continued attempts to do this is just absurd at
&gt;&gt;this point.
&gt;So let's make a summary.
&gt;In 1984, Gauri wanted to answer a simple question: What is main cause of
&gt;the weathering of the Sphinx? So he looked first at the soluble salts by
&gt;leaching a first sample and he found a lot of salts (1.2 to 5%).
&gt;Then he looked at the nature of the clay minerals to check if there was
&gt;swelling clays (Halloysite and smectites). He took another sample and
&gt;crushed it to a 300 mesh powder, digested it with 10% AcOH for 2 hours
&gt;(short time), and collected the fine residue while in suspension on
&gt;filter papers. Is that the whole clastic fraction or just clays/fine
&gt;silt?
">

The whole samples would have been completely powdered to 300 mesh
using a pestle and mortar. That's a grain-size below 44 microns in the
powdered samples (most of the original silt fraction and all of the
clay fraction + all the silt- and sand-sized particles that were
crushed into a powder).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Is there any sedimentation at this point or is everything in
&gt;suspension?
">

Most silt particles will take time to settle out. If he waited 6 hours
or so only clay size particles would be in suspention. However, the
material collected was in state of suspension from the whole sample.
All that is needed to do this is a quick swirll with a stir stick to
get a whole clastic fraction sample for testing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Anyway, he analyzed that fine residue by XRD and he mainly
&gt;found kaolinite.
">

In the "fraction consisting of clay minerals", which is the clay
fraction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No quartz at this point.
">

Since the sand and silt fraction has been crushed to a powder, it's
certainly there. However, it's not a major part of the  "properties of
the fraction consisting of clay minerals" which is the original clay
fraction. As you correctly state he was looking for salt and clay
minerals to gain an understanding of the weathering mechanisms... he
would not be necessarily interested in the presence of quartz in such
a context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But he got his answer: Not
&gt;much swelling clays.
">

By whole clastic fraction powder XRD only. Quite different from the
XRD work of  Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999) on the clastic fraction
separated by another method which is not mentioned in Gauri (1984).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In addition he shows a table giving Sand/Silt/Clays ratio, i. e.
&gt;granulometry clasification, which means that he separated the residues
&gt;by sieving.
">

Not from the 300 mesh, powdered samples mentioned above. This is from
different samples... whole samples that are dissolved of their
carbonate fraction without crushing. One cannot get as accurate a
grain-size distribution by crushing the grains in the sample so that
original sand-sized particles become silt-sized below 44 microns in
size.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;How did he separate the clastic fraction from the carbonate fraction
&gt;before sieving?
">

After leaching out the soluble salts from a whole sample of about 50
grams, placing it in dilute HCL until all the carbonate is removed.
Thus a clastic fraction sample.... and not some combination of
carbonate fraction, soluble-salt, fraction, and clastic fraction for
grain-size separation and XRD on the clastic fraction grain-sizes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It is not described but there is absolutely no reason to
&gt;think that he used a different method to digest calcite than the one he
&gt;used to get the residue for the XRD, i. e., using AcOH.
">

He clearly did not crush the sample to 300 mesh before sieving... so
it is already different that what you mentioned above for AcOH method.
My guess is that he wanted to make sure all the carbonate was gone
from the samples and not have to wait many days or use a vacuum pump
to do so. His original 1984 XRD work was done on AcOH dissolved sample
and his 1999 XRD work was done on HCL dissolved sample from the 1984
clastic fraction grain-size separation. Both of which yielded the same
clay minerals in the clay fraction. No clay minerals were identified
in the silt and sand fraction, only quartz.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In addition,
&gt;this method corresponds to the general method described in his 1999 book
&gt;except the incubation time and AcOH concentration (paragraph 2.2.3.1 see
&gt;full quote in &lt;1hs8jqh.l0je6jj75raeN%firstn ... @lastname.net&gt;)
">

The "general method" does not state HCL cannot be used.... which is
understandable since dilute HCL has been used successfully in other
studies. He is using the separated grain-size clastic fraction samples
from Gauri (1984) in the XRD work of Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999). He
used the method described in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999) to separate
the clastic fraction samples originally from Gauri (1984).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In these conditions a significant portion of the clays flocculate
&gt;because the salts were not leached away  and no hexametaphosphate was
&gt;added to the sample to disperse the clay before sieving.
">

Unfortunately, that's not supported by the method actually used for
the separation of the clastic fraction in Gauri (1984) which is
discussed in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999). The salts were leached away
so the clastic fraction could be separated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore it is
&gt;likely that the silt fraction contains clay minerals.

For some unknown reason you still do not understand what a clastic
fraction is (remarkable since I have pointed it out many times)... it

Wishful thinking. A guess is not a fact. Especially when Gauri 1984
describes 2 different experiments:
- For salt analysis he says "the water-soluble salts were extracted by
placing powdered limestone in deionized water."
- For the clastic fraction: "Further, for the purpose of concentration
of other possible minerals in the limestone relative to calcite, the
samples were powdered to approximately 300 mesh and digested"

Snip the rest which are just comment based on your initial guess.
You simply don't have enough information to claim that there is not more
than 1 % clay in most of the beds.

So far you did not proove that the disaggregated starting material
suitable for geopolymer can't be extracted from the Member II.

You must concede that the only way to prove your claim is to repeat the
disaggregating at a significant scale, at least a ton of material, not a
plastic bag, using Giza limestone, something the Egyptian authorities
don't allow. One may wonder what they are afraid of.

Wait a minute. You said that he certainly collected the whole clastic

">

In 1984 he made a simple analysis on the whole clastic fraction. In
addition he calculated the clay/silt/sand ratio of his preparation by
sieving.
In 1999 he made a more complete analysis with a new separation of
clay/silt/sand and the XRD of each fraction.

&gt; original sand-sized particles become silt-sized below 44 microns in
&gt; size.
">

From Gauri 1984:
"Further, for the purpose of concentration of other possible minerals in
the limestone relative to calcite, the samples were powdered to
approximately 300 mesh and digested in 10% acetic acid for two hours."

Approximatively does not mean that it was exactly 300 mesh. Note that he
uses a 230 mesh screen to separate sand from silt/clay as described in
paragraph 2.2.3.1 in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999).
So there are no indication that he did not use his first separation
process (AcOH digestion of powedered sample) to estimate the
sand/silt/clay/ratio.
If he had use a different method, it would be in the paper.

Of course you claim that he used a different method. If it was the case
that would mean that Gauri had done a poor job by not reporting the
method used to separate the fractions. That's your claim, not mine.

There are other issues in Gauri's work. For example, in the 1999 book,
when he says that there is only quartz in the silt and sand fraction.
What bed is he talking about, all of them? That's not "crystal" clear.
We don't know either the exact origin of the sample (west side/east side
of the sphinx? enclosure wall?
Moreover, since Member II was formed in a lagoon, One might expect that
the layers are not uniform either in thickness or composition at the
scale of the Giza plateau (Actualy that is implied by Aigner's work).
While Gauri's data are specific to the sphinx, they might no be
representative of the whole Wadi.

So my point is that there is enough room for the geopolymer theory and
that the current results are sufficient to make more research.

The rock easily disaggregated in a bag of water overnight or
whatever.... nothing else was added or done to it. The rock either
behaves this way or they do not. Take your pick.... If you pick it
does then nothing is stopping it from occurring so some lesser degree

weathering and dissolution.

It's clear you feel that it will.... otherwise no need for the

Morris (1994) of a 12 foot layer 1i that may contain 5-10% clay
minerals in its silt fraction. It does not exist...

BTW, since there is no Na -Al silicate binder... why are you still
arguing about the amount of clay? I think you need to be a little more
concerned how the ancient Egyptian strained it out of the slurry

diatoms.

&gt;&gt;Then your claimed Yoshimira (1987) result do not appear consistent

&gt;Barsoum only analyzed outer casing and inner casing stones from the
&gt;great pyramid. I guess he is cautious and don't want to extrapolate to
&gt;core blocks.
">

That's a bit of a stretch, with statements like "A careful examination
of the visible pyramid blocks on the Giza plateau suggests that most
-especially in the core- appear to have been carved." (page 3795) and
"Under these constraints, the ancient builders apparently compromised
and apparently built an out-side constraining ring of cast blocks
surrounding a core that was carved and hauled into place."(page 3795)
.

Circles and circles and circles....

First it was this:

"In this case you have Lehner (and the majority of Egyptologists) on
one side who says pyramid stones we entirely made of carved stones.
Davidovits on the other side says that the entire pyramid is made of
cast stones. But now, we have Barsoum that says that the bottom part
is carved while the top is casted. The later is probably the closest
to the truth."

Make up your mind about which side of the fence you're on, Barsoum new
or Davidovits old/new?, and stick with it.

So now were back again to most of the pyramid is geopolymer instead of
just some... Again, that's a lot of crushed limestone you need to
disaggregate.  You're going to have to demonstrate the location of the
source for all that material, and a 12 foot thick, clay-rich bed that
does not exist is not going to work in this case. I'm sure you can
continue to claim the ancient Egyptians scraped the weathering off of
the outcrops and waited for it to weathering again when they ran out
so they could complete the GP over a quite a few thousand years....

I said weathering not "weathering rate". There is a difference between
those 2 terms.

Yes, the weathering rate is slower, but when exposed to a 1 million
years or so of periodic exposure these rocks claimed to disaggregate
due to water soaking should be significantly weathered and
subsequently eroded They are the dissolution weathering mechanism, a
very very slow process of natural weathering due to water exposure.

What Member III? That little bit on the Sphinx head and the quarried

You mean bed 7... bed 6 is subdivided into i and ii layers. This whole
area was heavily eroded when the Pliocene flooding occurred, thus the
wave eroded cliffs all around the Giza Plateau as well as on top of it
(the pyramids are built on top of a wave eroded terrace). See Aigner
(1983). There are solution-widened joints with colour bands in the
Sphinx enclosure and area (El Aref &amp; Refai 1987, Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
1999) that are produced by water. They have been there for a long time
and conduits for perched ground water flow and should be susceptible
to both rain runoff and sea flooding since the Pliocene (the flooding
and the subsequent erosion morphology was over a million years ago).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;After the pyramid time, everything was buried under

It's amazing how quickly you forget Reader's few hundred years of
exposure. Where do you think his erosion of the enclosure is coming
from? The Sphinx and enclosure was exposed for over about 1000 years
during its history sufficiently to be eroded to the degree it is in
1800's photographs.

&gt;Wait a minute. You said that he certainly collected the whole clastic
&gt;fraction, not a clay fraction. So the XRD is the one of the whole
&gt;clastic fraction =&gt;the main element of the clastic fraction is
&gt;kaolinite.

The clastic fraction is made up of the sand fraction, silt fraction
and clay fraction. The clay minerals are clay-sized and are in the
clay fraction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;No quartz at this point.
&gt;&gt;Since the sand and silt fraction has been crushed to a powder, it's
&gt;&gt;certainly there. However, it's not a major part of the  &quot;properties of
&gt;&gt;the fraction consisting of clay minerals&quot; which is the original clay
&gt;&gt;fraction. As you correctly state he was looking for salt and clay
&gt;&gt;minerals to gain an understanding of the weathering mechanisms... he
&gt;&gt;would not be necessarily interested in the presence of quartz in such
&gt;&gt;a context.
&gt;Here we have the same interpretation.

&gt;&gt;By whole clastic fraction powder XRD only. Quite different from the
&gt;&gt;XRD work of  Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999) on the clastic fraction
&gt;&gt;separated by another method which is not mentioned in Gauri (1984).
&gt;In 1984 he made a simple analysis on the whole clastic fraction. In
&gt;addition he calculated the clay/silt/sand ratio of his preparation by
&gt;sieving.

No he did not... the onlything new is the XRD work on the original
1984 grain-size samples.

&gt;&gt;Not from the 300 mesh, powdered samples mentioned above. This is from

&gt;&gt;grain-size distribution by crushing the grains in the sample so that
&gt;&gt;original sand-sized particles become silt-sized below 44 microns in
&gt;&gt;size.
&gt;From Gauri 1984:
&gt;&quot;Further, for the purpose of concentration of other possible minerals in

&gt;approximately 300 mesh and digested in 10% acetic acid for two hours.&quot;
&gt;Approximatively does not mean that it was exactly 300 mesh. Note that he
&gt;uses a 230 mesh screen to separate sand from silt/clay as described in
&gt;paragraph 2.2.3.1 in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999).
&gt;So there are no indication that he did not use his first separation
&gt;process (AcOH digestion of powedered sample) to estimate the
&gt;sand/silt/clay/ratio.
&gt;If he had use a different method, it would be in the paper.
">

Here is the grain-size ranges: sand 2000-60 microns, silt 60-4
microns, clay &lt;4 microns

He states "samples were powdered" (i.e. no grit like sand-sized
particles produce) to "approximately" 300 mesh (44 microns). A
powdered sample does not contain sand-sized particles. The specimens
are crushed in a mortar until there is no longer any grittiness
present, thus the approximately 300 mesh. This crushes sand-sized
grains to silt and some silt to clay-sized grains making grain-size
analysis useless on such a powdered sample. This is done for powder
XRD mineral identification not grain size analysis. In powder XRD the
specimen is pulverized so a thin-film slurry of fine particles will
stick to a thinsection slide or filter paper when dried (not fall off
during the procedure because it's sand-sized particles). He does not
discuss the method used for grain size analysis. Stop trying to assert
Gauri does not know what he is doing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Of course you claim that he used a different method. If it was the case

So what... grain-size analysis is very basic to geologic work. So
because he showed a grain-size analysis table and didn't give a 2
paragraph description how he did it (like in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
1999), this is bad science because you have no clue how such a basic
technique is done? If one had to write a paper to make everyone who
has no clue how to do anything happy nothing would be published....

Your assertion that he is using a powdered sample crushed to 300 about
mesh for grain-size analysis is baseless!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That's your claim, not mine.

"for the purpose of concentration of other possible minerals" is not
the same as for the purpose of grain-size analysis. The purpose of
that is to separate the grain-sizes and not by crushing them.

Again, the outcrop at Giza are badly weathered. Much like the sphinx and

See, everything was in the powder for the X-Ray. And he identified clay
mineral as the main constituent of the clastic fraction.

For the rest we disagree on sieving the residues from the AcOH digestion
as described in Gauri 1984, or a different digestion using either AcOH
or diluted HCl as described in paragraph 2.2.3.1 in Gauri 1999.

He does not discuss the method used for grain size analysis, so there
are no certitude. Without calgon to prevent clay flocculation, you can't
be sure there are no clay-minerals in the silt fraction described in
Table 2 (Gauri 1984).
Let's compare bed 2i and bed 5i that have about the same % of non
carbonate materials (13 and 16.2, respectively).

bed     Sand/silt/clays/salts           pore size (&gt;5µm/0.5-5µm/&lt;0.5µm)

5i      4.60/2.77/4.06/4.77             52.1/18.7/29.1

In recent times it was buried in sand, not during the OK... seem to be
forgetting Reader again. Just how exactly do you think his claimed
erosion occurred? It's certainly not because Member III was in the way
or because sand protected the area from surface runoff.

BTW, that's a lot of Member III limestone to cover the whole area
around the Plateau to protect it... a harder limestone than Member II
and an enormous volume to quarry away if so. Which building did it go
into before the Sphinx was carved... the GP? The Member II from the
Sphinx enclosure went into the Sphinx Temple as pointed out by Aigner
stratigraphy work in the 1980s. Are you sure Gauri is not talking
about just around about the present location of the head of the Sphinx
and the quarry to the south when he says "the rest of the area"?

I never said there was not weathering, I said weathering consistent

exhibit this extreme behavior exhibited in the NOVA experiment which
should occur to some degree in a natural situation? These rock were
under water during part of the Pliocene and after this there was
clearly water in them at some point so that dissolution of the harder
Member II limestone could occur... it effects the marly limestone
orders of magnitude less then the harder limestone. That's not any way
consistant with your claims about these rocks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In bag of water overnight vs. little effect over epochs of geologic
time in rocks exposed to water soaking in solution-widened joints and
other solution structures. You might as well claim the weathering is
due to a gagle of rock fairies with a feather-dusting fetish... it's
about as believable in any geologic context.

&gt;&gt;&gt;kaolinite.
&gt;&gt;The clastic fraction is made up of the sand fraction, silt fraction
&gt;&gt;and clay fraction. The clay minerals are clay-sized and are in the
&gt;&gt;clay fraction.
&gt;That's a whole clastic fraction XRD. There was no fractionning in this

He discusses that in Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999) in Section 9.3.2,

That's 1.75 grams of salt in the sample first exposed to a diluted HCL

salinity is sufficient to the degree you assert. It's moot anyway
since Gauri leaches out the salts before the grain size analysis as

would like to understand your reasoning here.

No.

They both contain about 88% calcite... the porosity is effected by the
lithology of what that is made of quite a bit more than the clastic
fraction since it make up a considerabily greater volume of the rock.
The upper 4 beds in general are packed biomicrites, were as the lower
3 are sparse biomicrites. That means the lower beds have more micritic
(carbonate mud) and the upper 4 beds, which includes bed 5, are richer
in allochems (i.e. coarse-grained particles, such as shell fragments
and such) and the amount of such increases towards bed 7. The 2 groups
of micritic limestone actually are different subtypes of limestone
lithology and this is reflected in the pore size distribution, total
porosity, and their susceptibility to salt weathering and durability
as a result.

That's certainly what a slurry of less than about 300 mesh particles
does when it dries on a thin section or filter paper, and just how
exactly are sand and large silt particles conducive which such? Get
real.... you clearly have some understanding of how XRD is done so you
must have known when he powders the sample he is not leaving grains
much bigger than 300 mesh for the purpose of XRD. These samples were
useless for grain size analysis and the Table 2/9.2 does not reflect
there use with its sand fraction still present. Another test was
done... the one discussed in Section 9.3.2 of Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
(1999) since the table 2 of Gauri (1984) appears at the end of the
discussion of how it was done, just like the soluble salt analysis is
discussed in the preceding Section 9.3.1 form Gauri (1984).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So Gauri does not know what he is doing... not grain size analysis,

Actually, less than 1% clay present would be a bit closer to the
actual chemistry of the samples in the GP. As pointed out by Barsoum

XRF clearly indicating only 0.23 wt% Al203 and &lt;0.1 wt% Na2O in the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;BTW, Do you know that kaolinite is reported to swell in presence

So what? no Na -Al silicate binder in the samples... little to no
kaolinite present in the chemistry. You will need to find a new
weathering mechanism or a big flour sieve and a couple thousand
ancient Egyptians to give a good shaking. Give it up... it's just
dissolving into a big mess now. You should have gotten the binder
correct at the beginning, may have saved yourself a lot of trouble

Still have to remove the kaolinite from the slurry so it can be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I think you need to be a little more

&gt;Very simple. A different recipe could have been used. But the underlying
&gt;chemistry is the same: polymerisation of silicate in a basic media.

The underlying chemistry is not the same. No Na -Al silicate binder,
i.e. little to no kaolinite in the slurry. It's a lot of clay mineral
grains  to remove somehow, if you want to claim that there is
sufficient clay to disaggregate the rock to sediment. Care to tell us
how that removal is done?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If all you have is the NOVA experiment to back up the assertion that

&gt;Indeed. So why not let the geopolymer people experiment big blocks using
&gt;material from the Giza plateau?
">

Using the old or the new formula.... or the one not yet discovered
that turns kaolinite, i.e. the large volume of clay that's
disaggregating the limestone, into a non Na -Al silicate binder. You

adequately done so... and don't expect anyone to let you practice on
the OK quarries until you get it correct in the first place. Good

No need, it's quite clear from Davidovits (1987), Morris (1993), and

analytical testing if no one else can find what is claimed to be in
some of the samples, such as Harrell &amp; Penrod (1993) and Barsoum et.
al. (2006) on the Lauer sample, and Campbell and Folk (1992) for
another GP casing sample. Pick a side of the fence and stick with it.
Since the Lauer sample's testing appears to be flawed in Davidovits
(1984, apparently Davidovits think so since it's not on his website as
a binder for the casing geopolymer claims) why do you still believe
the accuracy of the Tura testing and it's comparison to the Lauer

Now that is actually is a straw man as well as an excellent example of

Soluble salts will dissolve when placed in water. You will notice that
Gauri in the rest of the quote above that you left out uses salt
flocculation to remove the clay minerals from suspension that
separated the clays from the silt fraction so that it can be analyzed
on a thin section by allowing the basil planes of the clay minerals to
rest on the surface, not silt-sized randomly orientated flocculation
particles. He saturates the water with NaCl to do this flocculation,
then the salt flocculation is dissolved away when washed in water
freeing the clay particles for the XRD analysis.

When is the water sufficiently saturated with NaCL in samples with
3.5% soluble salt?  If Gauri can remove the salt flocculation by
washing the sample at the end of the process why are they still there
when they are repeatedly soaked in water through the previous parts of
the process when the water is not saturated with NaCl?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not going on a wild links chase for you.... provide a link to a

referring to the sand and silt fraction of that Table when he states
"X-Ray diffraction of sand and silt fraction revealed the presence of

The sample was powdered to aproximentally 300 mesh for dissolution and

It is for an orientated clay mineral XRD which is what is usually used
for clay mineral identification like glycolation. Clay particles
usually have a platy habit, like flat wafers. They should be mostly
loose single crystal grains when the samples are dried to the thin
section slide for XRD, not flocculated silt-sized masses. So that many
of the mineral grains in the slurry dry with their basil planes (flat
surface of the wafer) parallel to the surface of the glass slide...
thus giving the sample a more preferred crystallographic orientation
so that oriented measurement of 2-theta can be done and obtain peak
intensity at certain d-spacings. The grains are not suppose to be
flocculated when they are dried on the thin section slide.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's done to a slurry in a beaker, after all it's an exchange

Stop wasting my time, it's limestone we are discussing here, not
soils. You should know perfectly well that the separation of clays
from a soil is completely different than from a limestone.... Try
again. BTW, Gauri leached the samples of salt before grain-size
analysis as clearly stated on page 197 of Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
(1999), there is no salt flocculation present. So I don't know why you
keep making this so hard on yourself...

&gt;&gt;referring to the sand and silt fraction of that Table when he states
&gt;&gt;&quot;X-Ray diffraction of sand and silt fraction revealed the presence of
&gt;&gt;quartz only.&quot; immediately after this? Ya, that right we can't be sure

"limited number".... based on what? He after all is discussing the
clastic fraction of the Sphinx Member II limestone. The only bed he

It's what's plausible that really matters here.... he cannot do
grain-size analysis on powdered samples to 300 mesh... he has done
another test and not a duplication of the powder XRD sample designed
to determine mineral abundance of the clays, either, but one typical
of a grain-size analysis such as that described on pages 197-198 of

It's basic geology... if it's claimed that they are so susceptible

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So let's make a summary.
&gt;In 1984, Gauri wanted to answer a simple question: What is main cause of
&gt;the weathering of the Sphinx? So he looked first at the soluble salts by
&gt;leaching a first sample and he found a lot of salts (1.2 to 5%).
&gt;Then he looked at the nature of the clay minerals to check if there was
&gt;swelling clays (Halloysite and smectites). He took another sample and
&gt;crushed it to a 300 mesh powder, digested it with 10% AcOH for 2 hours
&gt;(short time), and collected the fine residue while in suspension on
&gt;filter papers. Is that the whole clastic fraction or just clays/fine
&gt;silt?
">

The whole samples would have been completely powdered to 300 mesh
using a pestle and mortar. That's a grain-size below 44 microns in the
powdered samples (most of the original silt fraction and all of the
clay fraction + all the silt- and sand-sized particles that were
crushed into a powder).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Is there any sedimentation at this point or is everything in
&gt;suspension?
">

Most silt particles will take time to settle out. If he waited 6 hours
or so only clay size particles would be in suspention. However, the
material collected was in state of suspension from the whole sample.
All that is needed to do this is a quick swirll with a stir stick to
get a whole clastic fraction sample for testing.

****end qoute*****

Forgot your own quantifying statement of "crushed it to a 300 mesh
powder" that I was answering to, and my statement "The whole samples
would have been completely powdered to 300 mesh using a pestle and
mortar. That's a grain-size below 44 microns... "? You then change
your mind to stated this "Approximatively does not mean that it was
exactly 300 mesh.", implying that sand and coarse silt was still in
the powder, in the post that proceeded the one with the above quote,
apparently you realized that a "crushed it to a 300 mesh powder"
sample was not going to support you completely unsupported assertions.
Talk about dishonesty....

So let me get this straight first it's "crushed it to a 300 mesh
powder" and when I point out this is not good for grain size analysis
you change your mind to this "Approximatively does not mean that it
was exactly 300 mesh. Note that he uses a 230 mesh [.. ]" and then
when I point out it's not consistent with whole clastic fraction XRD
you switch back to "crushed it to a 300 mesh powder"..... make up your
mind!!!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;The goal was
&gt;&gt;&gt;to rapidly identify swelling clays. And he identified clay minerals.
&gt;&gt;The &quot;fraction consisting of clay minerals&quot; is the clay fraction.
&gt;In Gauri 1984 &quot;The fine residue, while in a state of suspension, was
&gt;collected on filter papers and analyzed by x-ray diffraction. The
&gt;following are the results of THESE analyses: [...snip soluble salt
&gt;paragraph ] Non-Carbonate Clastic Fraction. The major properties of the
&gt;fraction consisting of clay minerals is revealed by the x-ray
&gt;diffraction spectra.&quot;
&gt;According to you, he managed to get only the clay fraction from residues
&gt;in suspension collected on filter papers? &lt;scratching my head
">

No, just the "major properties" of the fraction consisting of  clay
minerals which is the clay fraction. All that is in the clastic
fraction are quartz and clay minerals. There is quartz in the XRD, but
since it's been powdered to about 300 mesh he can't tell if it is in
from the clay, silt or sand fraction anymore so he does not mention
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;See, everything was in the powder for the X-Ray. And he identified clay
&gt;&gt;&gt;mineral as the main constituent of the clastic fraction.
&gt;&gt;Since when are the clay mineral of kaolinite, illite, and
&gt;&gt;montmorillonite separate silt-sized particles?
&gt;We're talking about the whole clastic fraction! you know, the one you
&gt;get when you stir the solution and collect the residues on filter
&gt;papers.
">

What happened to the sand and coarse silt particles? Of course, Gauri
(1984) call it "The fine residue" which sand and coarse silt is not.
You know the ones claimed by you to be purposely missed when the
samples were powdered for XRD. So now it's again "crushed it to a 300
mesh powder" i.e. no sand and coarse silt particles..... make up your
mind!!!!!

If the sand grains are not crushed to fine silt they are not part of
the whole clastic fraction XRD since they will sink to the bottom of
the beaker rapidly after stirring and those that managed to be snagged
are highly susceptible to falling off the filter paper when they are
dried. Not powdering the sample to 300 mesh is not giving a
representative sample of the whole clastic fraction for XRD. The
samples for whole clastic fraction were powdered to about 300 mesh and
are unsuitable for grain size analysis of the original sediments as a
result.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;For the rest we disagree on sieving the residues from the AcOH digestion
&gt;&gt;&gt;as described in Gauri 1984, or a different digestion using either AcOH
&gt;&gt;&gt;or diluted HCl as described in paragraph 2.2.3.1 in Gauri 1999.
&gt;&gt;2.2.3.1 is for clay mineral XRD identification not grain size
&gt;&gt;analysis.
&gt;Wrong.
">

Grain-size analysis is not mentioned in the introduction to Section
2.2.3 on page 37 only XRD analysis for clay mineral identification is,
that the title after all "Identification" i.e. of clay minerals. It's
quite clear what  2.2.3.1 is preparing the sample for, and it's not
grain-size analysis.

I guess "Khent-Kawes" refers to her tomb at Giza... it quite a

In fact it's on the south side of the Central Mastaba Field. He does
not really  tell us very much about the exact location of the outcrop
since that's a big area .

http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/IS/SANDERS/PHOTOS/EGYPT/GIZA/giza94.html

The outcrops in this area are weathered by salt weathering and it
extremely doubtfully any fresh exposed surfaces exist.  KhentKawes
tomb doesn't appear to be that susceptible to water and erosion
either, presumably it made of the same rocks as the claimed outcrop
since it is close to it... Much of it looks like the same hard
limestone in the upper Sphinx beds, or possibily a little higher into
Member III since it appears to be at a slightly higher elevation from
a photo I have from the NW corner of the Sphinx enclsoure, with some
thin marly layers. The weathering here is less pronounced than the
Sphinx rocks.

Looks to be like Davidovits is still picking a weathered rock to
test.... not the first time he has done this since Davidovits and
Morris (1988) states that the Teti pyramid sample given to Davidovits
by Lauer was "weak and extremely weathered" on page 85, but was still
XRDed and asserted it was make with geopolymer cement. Combine this
with weathered examples of Fig 6 and the "easily friable" flakes and
other collected surface detritus of Barsoum et. al. (2006) and we
begin to see a pattern here.

&gt;&gt;Actually, less than 1% clay present would be a bit closer to the

Well, it has to be all/most geopolymer casing, core masonry, and
granite when one asserts that the limestone is too hard/fragile and
heavy for the ancient Egyptians to use with their copper chisels and
such.... no one should expect anyone in their right mind is going to

How did the rock disintegrate then? Remember, that in the Lauer sample

The silt/clay ratio may differ between both experiment because in the
1984 unlike in 1999, the salts were not leached away before digestion,
thus may result in clay flocculation and significant amount of clay
mineral in the silt-size fraction. One should understand that in 1984
the salts are leached away during and after digestion but after clays
flocculate.

You're guessing. You don't have the information to be sure of your

In 1984: no salt leaching prior digestion? =&gt; possibility of clay
flocculation and significant contamination of clay minerals in the
silt-size fraction.
In 1999: salt leaching prior digestion with HCl=&gt; less flocculation,
less clay minerals in the silt fraction and XRD shows quartz only if you

&gt; It's you who does not understand the concept of context, but

Of course, you're so much clever...

I never changed my mind. I was just showing how incoherent you are.
The sample was crushed to "approximatively" 300 mesh to ease the
digestion by AcOH. Most beds contain more than 90% of calcite and you
want to make me believe that all sand-size and silt-size quartz particle
were crushed to particles smaller than 44 µm? No way I can believe you.

I don't believe you either when you say that he analyzed a whole clastic
fraction containing sand+silt+clay.
Here is the rational. Gauri wanted to identify the clays minerals. So he
was interested by the fine residues he got after the digestion, i. e.,
the one that are in suspension after a little swirl and that he can
easily collect on a filter paper. Those are silt sand clays. Not sand!
That's what he analyzed by XRD.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&quot;The insoluble residue residue is then washed in distilled water and
&gt; &gt;dried. The dry matter is placed on a 230 mesh screen in order to seprate
&gt; &gt;the sand fraction from silt and clay: the latter pass through the screen
&gt; &gt;[=&gt;sand fraction]. Water is added to the silt and clay fraction, and
&gt; &gt;the mixture is agitated and then allowed to stay for nearly 6 hours,
&gt; &gt;during which most of the silt settles out [=&gt;silt fraction]. The
&gt; &gt;suspended matter is siphoned out and treated with a saturated solution
&gt; &gt;of sodium chloride in which the clay minerals flocculate and are able to
&gt; &gt;settle from the suspension [=&gt;clay fraction]&quot;.

&gt; Portions of the procedure above can be used for grain size analysis...
&gt; but since he does not mention any of the preparations for the removal
&gt; of the salt by leaching before dissolution of the carbonate minerals
&gt; or weighting of the different fraction after separation the above is
&gt; not about grain-size analysis, but about preparing the sample for XRD
&gt; clay mineral identification as the title and introduction of section
&gt; 2.2.3 is clearly discussing.
">

I disagree (what a surprise...)
After the digestion In chapter 2.2.3.1 "the insoluble residue is then
washed in distilled water and dried" =&gt; say good bye to your salts. And
you can easily weigh the dried clastic fraction. It's also trivial to
get the weigth of the sand fraction after sieving on the 230 mesh
screen.
Then, when the sample is resuspended in water and the silt settles down,
it is easy to dry it and weigh it. Then you can dry the clay fraction
and weigh it.
In addition, there are no other fractionning protocols describe anywhere
in the book. Of course, missing protocols are not issues for your
conception of experimental science.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He provides Table 9.2 from the 1984 paper at the end of a discussion
&gt; of how grain-size analysis was done on the Sphinx limestone... The
&gt; clay minerals have been separated out for each layer and XRD was done
&gt; using dry oriented samples and glycolation. So why on Earth do you
&gt; think he is testing something other than the all the sand and silt
&gt; fractions when he states only quartz detected?
">

My point has always being the same.  He tested the sand and silt
fraction from a different fractionning protocols than in 1984.
The protocol in 1984 may produce clay flocculation =&gt; silt-size clay
aggregates, because salt were not leached away. It may not be the same
in the 1999 protocol that involves leaching salt/HCl digestion. So the
silt/clay ratio in the 1984 table may not be relevant to the 1999 XRD
analysis.

Of course, according to John R McArthur, there is absolutely no reason
whatsoever to use calgon to prevent clay flocculation or disperse
flocculated clays in fractionning protocols... All the labs who
systematically use calgon are just stupid... And promoting the use of
calgon such as in this book is equally stupid...

Well, we must now understand from Moore et. al. (1997) that calgon is
not used to prevent salt flocculation, since the salt is washed out
before it's added to the supernatant nor does it prevent flocculation
of  &lt;2 micron clay particles with calcium chloride, that flocculation
is not irreversible and that includes salt flocculation, that the
sample is not flocculated for cation saturation, or that the samples
are flocculated for an orientated mount for XRD.... as you have
repeatedly claimed through the previous posts.  I'm glad to see that
we finally got all that out of the way of this discussion.

It would appear that calgon is actually used to prevent the formation
of very delicate clay-clay, edge-to-surface flocculation in the clay
sized particles due to charge differences on the surfaces of the
minute grains. Just how is that allowing significant volumes of clay
to become mysteriously lodged in the silt fraction of bed 1i? It's
quite clear that when we look at the other layers of the Sphinx
limestone in Table 9.2 that those that contain the largest clay
fraction don't really contain a significant amount of silt. Gee, now
how exactly does that work in your world?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Read Moore et. al. (1997) a little more clearly. Preferably the first
paragraph on page 187, washing of the sample in distilled water to
remove the salts produces a sample that has either full or incipient
dispersion even if it was previously salt flocculated. What is it you
do not understand about the meaning of the term "full" dispersion,
i.e. no flocculation. It's clear washing the sample can completely
deflocculate salt flocculation if it has actually occurred so some
degree, and that requires a sufficient amount of salt in the solution
in the first place. You still have not even provided a source to back

limestones containing 3.5% salt.

Read Moore et. al. (1997)... clay are not "generally flocculated for

samples or on the mounted slide. If you don't like me pointing out

You still have not provided a source to back up your assertion that a
limestone with 3.5% salt will produce any salt flocculation. You have
absolutely nothing to support that "significant contamination" of the
silt fraction has occurred in bed 1i due to salt flocculation or

"different effects" Ya, soak for 5-10 hours/whatever to completely

the Giza Platuea disaggregates in water in 5-10 hours.  The rocks were
saturated for 100,000s of years during the Pliocene, since they were
below sea level and under the waters of a gulf of the Mediterranean
Sea. Not much of an effect in rocks on the Giza Plateau that were
exposed to this water in the past and are now exposed by ancient
Egyptian quarrying for us to examine (other than colour banding that
converges on solution widened joints as the waters regressed... i.e.
the joints were open and water flowed through them).

You're the one who can't seem to keep tract of your own claims as you
flip-flop back and forth at will.

I'm "incoherent" because, what? I'm pointing out when you claim the
sand and coarse-silt is not crushed to a powder and is left intact
it's not useable for whole clastic fraction powder XRD, and then in
rebuttal you start quoting me from a post before you changed your mind
to the above and were you were originally claiming that the sample was
"crushed it to a 300 mesh powder"? Ya, whatever.... circles, circles,
circles...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The sample was crushed to &quot;approximatively&quot; 300 mesh to ease the
&gt;digestion by AcOH. Most beds contain more than 90% of calcite and you
&gt;want to make me believe that all sand-size and silt-size quartz particle
&gt;were crushed to particles smaller than 44 µm?
">

Ya, and that's also to produce a powdered, fine residue of
approximately 300 mesh for use in whole clastic fraction powder XRD.

If only part of the sand or silt fractions were crushed to smaller
grain-sizes when the samples were "powdered" to a "fine residue" of
"approximately 300 mesh" it destroys the sample for grain-size
analysis of the original sediments. Another test was done.... The one
described on pages 197-98 of Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay (1999).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No way I can believe you.
">

Only by purposely ignoring Garui's use of "powdered" and "fine
residue" to describe the sample after preparation to "approximately
300 mesh" for XRD purposes. The sand and silt fraction is no longer
representative of the original sample's grain-size fractionation since
it was powdered to 300 mesh so no grain-size analysis can be
accomplished on such.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't believe you either when you say that he analyzed a whole clastic
&gt;fraction containing sand+silt+clay.
&gt;Here is the rational. Gauri wanted to identify the clays minerals. So he
&gt;was interested by the fine residues he got after the digestion, i. e.,
&gt;the one that are in suspension after a little swirl and that he can
&gt;easily collect on a filter paper. Those are silt sand clays. Not sand!
&gt;That's what he analyzed by XRD.
">

It is clearly stated by Gauri (1984) "Further, for the purpose of
concentration of other possible minerals in the limestone relative to
calcite, the samples were powdered to approximately 300 mesh [...]".
Clastic sand particles are not made out of calcite so they are in the
"other possible minerals" category... the sand was crushed so its
mineralogy can be tested by powder XRD as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The insoluble residue residue is then washed in distilled water and
&gt;&gt;&gt;dried. The dry matter is placed on a 230 mesh screen in order to seprate
&gt;&gt;&gt;the sand fraction from silt and clay: the latter pass through the screen
&gt;&gt;&gt;[=&gt;sand fraction]. Water is added to the silt and clay fraction, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;the mixture is agitated and then allowed to stay for nearly 6 hours,
&gt;&gt;&gt;during which most of the silt settles out [=&gt;silt fraction]. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;suspended matter is siphoned out and treated with a saturated solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;of sodium chloride in which the clay minerals flocculate and are able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;settle from the suspension [=&gt;clay fraction]&quot;.
&gt;&gt;Portions of the procedure above can be used for grain size analysis...
&gt;&gt;but since he does not mention any of the preparations for the removal
&gt;&gt;of the salt by leaching before dissolution of the carbonate minerals
&gt;&gt;or weighting of the different fraction after separation the above is
&gt;&gt;not about grain-size analysis, but about preparing the sample for XRD
&gt;&gt;clay mineral identification as the title and introduction of section
&gt;&gt;2.2.3 is clearly discussing.
&gt;I disagree (what a surprise...)
">

With what? It can't be the context of the section since that is quite
clearly stated in Chapter 3 to be for XRD identification of clay
minerals or with portions of the procedure above can be used for
grain-size analysis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;After the digestion In chapter 2.2.3.1 &quot;the insoluble residue is then
&gt;washed in distilled water and dried&quot; =&gt;say good bye to your salts. And
&gt;you can easily weigh the dried clastic fraction. It's also trivial to
&gt;get the weigth of the sand fraction after sieving on the 230 mesh
&gt;screen.

So you agree that portions of the procedure above can be used for
grain-size analysis.... thanks for agreeing with me about that...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Then, when the sample is resuspended in water and the silt settles down,
&gt;it is easy to dry it and weigh it. Then you can dry the clay fraction
&gt;and weigh it.
">

Read that section a little more carefully a then rationalize what it
actually says into this wonderful imagination of yours. The clay
fraction during grain-size analysis, as clearly stated Table 9.2, is &lt;
4 microns.... what Gauri is separating with 6 hours in suspension is
not the clay fraction but individual clay minerals in the clay
fraction below about 2 microns in size specifically for XRD, somewhat
like what Moore et. al. (1997) is doing in the final stages of
particle separation for grains less than 2 microns in size. The clay
fraction does not necessarily contain just clay minerals... and these
are missed in this XRD procedure above.

So whatever this "clay fraction" is you alluding to in the above which
he actually calls "suspended matter" and "clay minerals", it's not the
one generated in Table 9.2 since it's not just for these very small
particles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In addition, there are no other fractionning protocols describe anywhere
&gt;in the book. Of course, missing protocols are not issues for your
&gt;conception of experimental science.

Actually it is stated.... Read page 198 of Gauri &amp; Bandyopadhyay
(1999) again. He's using sieves to separate the fractions.... and
there is little chance that any of the delicate structures produced by
edge-to-surface clay flocculation (if any have actually formed) is
going to survive the intensive sieving process through to 4 microns.

weathered in a way inconsistent with this NOVA claim. Unless
Davidovits quarried a fresh rock (and defaced an OK quarry without

detritus laying on the ground he was testing. So it would not be

what are you talking about? Gauri clearly says that he separates the
silt from the clay : "Water is added to the silt and clay fraction, and

silt settles out. the suspended matter is siphonedout and treated with a
saturated solution of sodium chloride in which the clay minerals
flocculate..."

In page 1998, he refers to chapter 3 (2.2.3). This is always the same

NO! the water soluble salt analysis and quantification was done
separately as it is clearly written in the 1984 paper. There is a
specific paragraph about it with amounts given in Table 1.

Then it is easy to substract the salt amount from the whole rock weight

&gt;&gt;clear from Table 2 of Gauri (1984) that the salts were removed from
&gt;&gt;the grain-size sample from layer 1i since the wt% salt in the sample
&gt;&gt;has been removed from the total weight.
&gt;Completely wrong. It is clearly written in the 1984 paper that the salts

So what... he has removed the separately determined salt content for
bed 1i from the total weight of the sample used for grain-size
analysis to get the total carbonate wt%. There is nothing wrong with
doing that. In the grain-size analysis of the clastic fraction both
the salt and carbonate minerals would be leached away consistent with
the geologic meaning of the term clastic fraction. Gauri (1984) knows
there is no salt in bed 1i anymore since he has removed it from the

XRD analysis of the Lauer sample since 2 other studies can't find the
zeolites or anything else giving those reflections seen in the XRD. As
well, Davidovits' SiO2, CaO, and SrO wt% values in figs 3-5 are not
even close to the XRF of Harrell &amp; Penrod (1993) for the Lauer sample,
or the Tura quarry sample they tested.  I would love someone to
explain how a limestone is made of 87-99% CaO in Fig 5!!! Also,
Davidovits and Morris (1988) states that the Teti pyramid sample given
to Davidovits by Lauer was "weak and extremely weathered" on page 85.
This is not clearly mentioned anywhere in Davidovits (1984). A
weathered sample is useless for chemical and mineralogical comparison
to quarry samples, which if he bothered to clearly point out would be
self-explanatory. I can go on and on here... it's you who does not
have any data that suggest the Tura quarries do not match if this
study is the best you can come up with. As pointed out by Harrell &amp;
Penrod (1993) from the local quarry samples they tested by XRF that

what was collected would had to have been detritus. The Teti pyramid
sample given to Davidovits by Lauer was "weak and extremely weathered"
so it's clear other weathered samples have been used without any
consideration for the chemical and mineralogical changes such produces
in other geopolymer studies.

Did the people who collected the samples have permission to quarry
fresh rock surfaces on the GP... If not, isn't that called vandalism
of a World Heritage Site? I guess we now have a clue why Hawass thinks
twice about letting any commercial geopolymer PR team anywhere near
the GP's surfaces... and for very good reasons. Better stick to
plopping muck into molds back in France, nothing very important gets
damaged that way for these periodic geopolymer promotions.

Weathering and erosion occur in nature... they are after all natural

a natural version of the NOVA experiment weathering process. It's

quarrying that were in the past exposed to standing water such as
solution-widened joints... and it does not as clearly pointed out by

&gt;&gt;saturated for 100,000s of years during the Pliocene, since they were
&gt;&gt;below sea level and under the waters of a gulf of the Mediterranean
&gt;&gt;Sea.
&gt;Do you know that sea water is saturated with salts and does not weather
&gt;rocks like fresh water.
">

Well, I guess you mean by "saturated" that normal seawater has a
salinity about 35 grams of salt per liter. A kilogram of layer 1i
limestone has 35 grams of salt (Gauri 1984). In case you were unaware
1 kg of limestone is a cube about 7-8 cm on a side. If that's the
case... then you have a real problem when all the salt in the rock
dissolves into the water that's "weathering" the limestone into
geopolymer sediments overnight or whatever by the ancient Egyptians.
I'm surprised the clays were not salt flocculating in the geo-muck
slurry creating structures that would clearly show up is any
geological investigation of the claimed geopolymer rocks just like
they do in natural rocks that have been sediment by salt flocculation
particles. Remember, that's the same salt that apparently
supersaturates grain-size analysis done by Gauri to produce
significant amounts of silt-sized clay flocs in just one sample and
selective missed all the rest. I hope you can "prove" the ancient
Egyptians leached out of the rocks all the salts before they started
so that your figments of imagination can maintain a slightly higher
degree of coherent continuity.

There is absolutely nothing preventing seawater from "weathering" the
limestone in a natural version of the NOVA experiment. And BTW, it's
not just seawater..... the macroporosity in the Plateau rocks would be
exposed to freshwater during the regression of the Mediterranean Sea
at the end of the Pliocene with it's associated proximity of the
ground water table for a considerable time thereafter, as well as
every time it rained sufficient to produce surface runoff.

Again... clay mineral grains of kaolinite, illite and montmorilloite

the particles are clay minerals since they are less than 4 microns in

It's remove along with the carbonate fraction.... that's basic
grain-size analysis. The clastic fraction does not contain salt by its
geologic definition and the use of this term to describe the results
tell us Gauri has removed the salts from it otherwise he would be
calling it something other than clastic fraction.

Why? Grain-size analysis is so basic to geology it's not necessary to
give a paragraph describing it (just like many other simple and basic
geologic methods like hand specimen analysis, thin section analysis,
etc.etc.etc.). It's not Guari's problem that people cannot understand
how something so simple and basic to geology was done... So far your

&gt;&gt;Just common sense... clastic fraction of a carbonate rock by

&gt;&gt;was leached out for grain-size analysis, otherwise it would be called
&gt;&gt;the soluble salt/clastic fraction.

So what? There is absolutely nothing wrong with that... thin section,
XRD, salt content analysis, and grains-size analysis can be done on 4
separate portions of a larger sample of micritic limestone and the
data collected can be combine to gain incite into the rock's
properties.... that's basic geology. Salts are removed and well as the
carbonate minerals and discarded so that grain-size of the clastic
fraction can be accomplished. If you think that the term clastic
fraction's meaning includes anything other than insoluble residue (no
salt or carbonate mineral) then please provide a geological definition
that states such, otherwise anywhere Gauri uses the term clastic
fraction there is no salt present.

Because Gauri uses the term clastic fraction and not clastic/salt

You have yet to provide anything that supports your assertions that a
3.5 wt% salt in a sample flocculates any appreciable clay into silt
