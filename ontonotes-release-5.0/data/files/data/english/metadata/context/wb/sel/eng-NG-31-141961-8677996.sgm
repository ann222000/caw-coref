&gt; A few days ago, his mommy took illiterate imbecile &quot;notroll&quot; to
&gt; the doctor.  The doctor asked the syphilitic old strumpet what
&gt; was wrong with her stuporous little kid, silently asking himself,
&gt; &quot;like what isn't?&quot;

&gt; The turd's mommy said &quot;All the little kids he plays with say they
&gt; can't understand him when he babbles.&quot;

&gt; Doc said, &quot;Is that because of the well known fact that he's too
&gt; fucking stupid to use the English language coherently, or is it
&gt; because of the well known fact that his jabbering is
&gt; unintelligible?&quot;

&gt; The pathetic little punk's mom said &quot;The incoherence is no longer
&gt; an issue, because all the little kids have heard each of his
&gt; little collection of idiotic remarks so many times that they
&gt; recognize them by the different snivels, flounces and swish that
&gt; go with each one.  We can't fix that without a brain and balls
&gt; transplant, and that would mean he would no longer fit as part of
&gt; our family of circus freaks.  I just want him to be as close as
&gt; possible to intelligibility.&quot;

&gt; Doc said, &quot;Sure...First one in your family for ten generations,
&gt; eh? {snicker}.  Oh, well, let's try this new experimental
&gt; surgery. We'll put his tongue closer to his brain by
&gt; transplanting it into his asshole.&quot;

&gt; The mommy said &quot;Yeah!  Why didn't I think of that?!&quot; The doctor
&gt; hid his face so she couldn't see the &quot;DUUUHHH&quot; on it, and coughed
&gt; so she couldn't hear the snicker.  Doc knew there was no thinking
&gt; in any of the &quot;notroll&quot; family heads, and in fact the only action
&gt; that ever happened in idiot &quot;notroll's&quot; head was the throbbing of
&gt; somebody's organ in his mouth.

&gt; The slut didn't notice the doctor's reaction, of course, since
&gt; congenital obliviousness is an indelible family tradition.  She
&gt; looked at her semi-aborted little idiot, who was standing there
&gt; chanting &quot;trailer, trailer, urinal cakes; this is what my mommy
&gt; bakes.&quot;  She said &quot;Shut up, you fucking idiot. Having your tongue
&gt; in your asshole will make it even more appropriate when the real
&gt; five-year-olds in your school room and other normal humans all
&gt; point at you and say 'that punk talks nothing but shit.'&quot;

&gt; So, they did the transplant.  The next day, the vacuous little
&gt; jackoff listened really carefully to the Remedial Kindergarten
&gt; class next door to his Remedial Everything room, memorized the
&gt; only comment that didn't swoosh way over his pachycephalous
&gt; dumbshit head and posted it on usenet.  He was going to make up
&gt; one of his own, but  like the doc said....  BWAAAAAHAHAHA!  Watch
&gt; out for airborne shoats when anything like that happens.

&gt; On the following day, the sad sack posted a slight variation of
&gt; the same remark, because learning two in two days is way beyond
&gt; his mental processes.   Both times, one of the most experienced
&gt; Remedial Kindergartners (two or three years and more to come),
&gt; calling himself &quot;John C[indergartner]&quot; &lt;snicker&gt; replied, saying
&gt; &quot;LOL,&quot; which is as complex a sentence as that amazingly thick
&gt; little puke can compose.  Later that day a remarkably ditzy bimbo
&gt; (who is so green with envy of all normal people that she thinks
&gt; the rocks in her head are green and names herself after them) and
&gt; her cretinous familiar (who was denied attendance at an imbecile
&gt; convention because he  couldn't figure out how to fill out the
&gt; application form) congratulated both of those whipped pussies.
&gt; After that, a crybaby dwarfish pretend lawyer (who is so
&gt; dimwitted that he thinks of his flouncy, girlish yapping as
&gt; homilies) chimed in and things went seriously pathetic.

&gt; The normal people all laughed at the world class stupidity and

I will post it again only because you begged (I mean really, man up) and
have an unlimited need for public humiliation.  Glad to help.

One afternoon when Johnboi was in third grade, he came running home to his
ma, crying.  He told her the other third grade kids were making fun of him.
He asked, &quot;Ma, are they making fun of me because I live in a trailer?&quot;  To
which his ma replied, &quot;No, son.  It's because you're 19.&quot;

Fool, I told you I was glad to have hurt your feelings.  You
forgot to thank me for continually manipulating you with that
sort of thing, since the only efficient process in your
protobrain is the condition known as algolagnia.

I know you’ve been wondering why you’re in the sad state you’re
in.  Here’s the deal.  Note that this is a simplified model, a
dumbing down nearly to your level of the actual process that
caused you.

When brains were being manufactured for the week’s babies,
imbecile notroll’s brain rolled down the assembly line at around
6:00 PM.  The guy with his hand on the dimmer switch was a bit
hard of hearing.  Just as imbecile notroll’s brain entered his
station, a co-worker yelled “Dinner!”  Sounded like “dimmer” to
the guy, so he moved the lever toward the IQ0 setting. The other
guy yelled “Dinner” again, so he moved it a bit more.  After
several iterations, he reached the minimum setting for a well
baby. Just then, the other guy held up a sign with “Dinner,
imbecile” written on it. The clumsy fool bumped the switch as he
got up, accidentally lowering it another notch.  Thus notroll’s
mental works ended up, by comparison to a normal human, dimmmer,
dimmer, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer and dimmer.

Now of course imbecile notroll will believe that’s exactly what
happened to him, since he can’t understand what I said about this
being just a simplistic model of the real misadventure that
provided the idiot for my amusement.

What really happened:  A pathetically small load was dumped into
imbecile notroll’s slutty mother’s snatch by a seriously
defective drive-by sperm donor.  Of course the strongest sperm
were leading the race, and of course they were all killed by the
vinegar she had just used to flush out the load from five minutes
earlier.  In dying, the viable sperm used up the last of the
spermicide, which had annihilated a dozen other wads earlier that
day, until the very last and weakest one struggled in.  Somehow
this ultimate weakling, the slowest and least of the latest few
thousand and the days millions and the week’s billions, was swept
up into the presence of the nearly rotten egg.  The rest is
history.

Post your halfwitticism of the month again, imbecile.  As before,
doing so will show your one “talent”--following my orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A few days ago, his mommy took illiterate imbecile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;notroll&quot; to the doctor.  The doctor asked the syphilitic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; old strumpet what was wrong with her stuporous little kid,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silently asking himself, &quot;like what isn't?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The turd's mommy said &quot;All the little kids he plays with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say they can't understand him when he babbles.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Doc said, &quot;Is that because of the well known fact that he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too fucking stupid to use the English language coherently,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or is it because of the well known fact that his jabbering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is unintelligible?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pathetic little punk's mom said &quot;The incoherence is no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; longer an issue, because all the little kids have heard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each of his little collection of idiotic remarks so many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times that they recognize them by the different snivels,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flounces and swish that go with each one.  We can't fix
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that without a brain and balls transplant, and that would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mean he would no longer fit as part of our family of circus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freaks.  I just want him to be as close as possible to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligibility.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Doc said, &quot;Sure...First one in your family for ten
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generations, eh? {snicker}.  Oh, well, let's try this new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experimental surgery. We'll put his tongue closer to his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brain by transplanting it into his asshole.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mommy said &quot;Yeah!  Why didn't I think of that?!&quot; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doctor hid his face so she couldn't see the &quot;DUUUHHH&quot; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it, and coughed so she couldn't hear the snicker.  Doc knew
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there was no thinking in any of the &quot;notroll&quot; family heads,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in fact the only action that ever happened in idiot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;notroll's&quot; head was the throbbing of somebody's organ in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his mouth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The slut didn't notice the doctor's reaction, of course,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since congenital obliviousness is an indelible family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition.  She looked at her semi-aborted little idiot,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who was standing there chanting &quot;trailer, trailer, urinal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cakes; this is what my mommy bakes.&quot;  She said &quot;Shut up,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you fucking idiot. Having your tongue in your asshole will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make it even more appropriate when the real five-year-olds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in your school room and other normal humans all point at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you and say 'that punk talks nothing but shit.'&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, they did the transplant.  The next day, the vacuous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little jackoff listened really carefully to the Remedial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kindergarten class next door to his Remedial Everything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; room, memorized the only comment that didn't swoosh way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over his pachycephalous dumbshit head and posted it on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usenet.  He was going to make up one of his own, but  like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the doc said.... BWAAAAAHAHAHA!  Watch out for airborne
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shoats when anything like that happens.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the following day, the sad sack posted a slight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variation of the same remark, because learning two in two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days is way beyond his mental processes.   Both times, one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the most experienced Remedial Kindergartners (two or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three years and more to come), calling himself &quot;John
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C[indergartner]&quot; &lt;snicker&gt; replied, saying &quot;LOL,&quot; which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as complex a sentence as that amazingly thick little puke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can compose. Later that day a remarkably ditzy bimbo (who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is so green with envy of all normal people that she thinks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rocks in her head are green and names herself after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them) and her cretinous familiar (who was denied attendance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at an imbecile convention because he  couldn't figure out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how to fill out the application form) congratulated both of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those whipped pussies. After that, a crybaby dwarfish
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretend lawyer (who is so dimwitted that he thinks of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flouncy, girlish yapping as homilies) chimed in and things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; went seriously pathetic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The normal people all laughed at the world class stupidity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and ignorance of that menagerie, but that doesn't mean they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't feel sorry for slower life forms like those.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shitforbrains &quot;notroll&quot; will now copy and paste something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; almost as lame as himself and pretend to be enjoying his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usenet life. He and the other airheads will frantically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; search for a prior occurrence of the above bullshit,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; desperately wishing they could legitimately claim I copied
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it from somewhere.  Failing that, they will all shriek
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;FOAM&quot; in chorus.  Bimbos are truly a funny species.

I predicted that I could manipulate a couple of eternally-tyronic
and criminally stupid cretins into counting paragraphs.

I didn’t predict that you might laughably pretend to have
understood what I wrote, though, mostly because it goes without
saying.  I hope such rude inattention didn’t hurt you too badly.
It’s not too late, though, to laugh at the absurd notion that
your mind has the horsepower to support such a complex process as
marveling. Anyway, it’s hilarious to watch you alternate between
“I didn’t read that” and your laughable attempts to dismiss the
bullshit that so easily milks instances of your anemic little
spasms out of you.

Your attempts to dissimulate your ignorance and illiteracy are
funnier every time.

Reminder:  Be sure to let me know when you’re ready to expand
your vocabulary.  At your current state, we could increase it by
a noticeable percent with one new word.

P.S. Speaking of words, illiterate basket case, please tell your
fellow illiterate notroll how many I’ve written here.  I’d rather
have him spend time repeating his halfwitticism of the month
instead of spending hours counting them.

&gt; guy yelled &quot;Dinner&quot; again, so he moved it a bit more.  After
&gt; several iterations, he reached the minimum setting for a well
&gt; baby. Just then, the other guy held up a sign with &quot;Dinner,
&gt; imbecile&quot; written on it. The clumsy fool bumped the switch as he
&gt; got up, accidentally lowering it another notch.  Thus notroll's
&gt; mental works ended up, by comparison to a normal human, dimmmer,
&gt; dimmer, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer and dimmer.

&gt; Now of course imbecile notroll will believe that's exactly what
&gt; happened to him, since he can't understand what I said about this
&gt; being just a simplistic model of the real misadventure that
&gt; provided the idiot for my amusement.

&gt; What really happened:  A pathetically small load was dumped into
&gt; imbecile notroll's slutty mother's snatch by a seriously
&gt; defective drive-by sperm donor.  Of course the strongest sperm
&gt; were leading the race, and of course they were all killed by the
&gt; vinegar she had just used to flush out the load from five minutes
&gt; earlier.  In dying, the viable sperm used up the last of the
&gt; spermicide, which had annihilated a dozen other wads earlier that
&gt; day, until the very last and weakest one struggled in.  Somehow
&gt; this ultimate weakling, the slowest and least of the latest few
&gt; thousand and the days millions and the week's billions, was swept
&gt; up into the presence of the nearly rotten egg.  The rest is
&gt; history.

&gt; Post your halfwitticism of the month again, imbecile.  As before,
&gt; doing so will show your one &quot;talent&quot;--following my orders.

You can only take orders.   Usually for a cheeseburger and fries.  That's on
those rare occasions when they let you work the counter at Burger Hut.
Usually your orders involve which urinals and grease traps to clean.

&gt;&gt; Fool, I told you I was glad to have hurt your feelings.  You
&gt;&gt; forgot to thank me for continually manipulating you with that
&gt;&gt; sort of thing, since the only efficient process in your
&gt;&gt; protobrain is the condition known as algolagnia.

&gt;&gt; I know you've been wondering why you're in the sad state
&gt;&gt; you're in.  Here's the deal.  Note that this is a simplified
&gt;&gt; model, a dumbing down nearly to your level of the actual
&gt;&gt; process that caused you.

&gt;&gt; When brains were being manufactured for the week's babies,
&gt;&gt; imbecile notroll's brain rolled down the assembly line at
&gt;&gt; around 6:00 PM.  The guy with his hand on the dimmer switch
&gt;&gt; was a bit hard of hearing.  Just as imbecile notroll's brain
&gt;&gt; entered his station, a co-worker yelled &quot;Dinner!&quot;  Sounded
&gt;&gt; like &quot;dimmer&quot; to the guy, so he moved the lever toward the
&gt;&gt; IQ0 setting. The other guy yelled &quot;Dinner&quot; again, so he moved
&gt;&gt; it a bit more.  After several iterations, he reached the
&gt;&gt; minimum setting for a well baby. Just then, the other guy
&gt;&gt; held up a sign with &quot;Dinner, imbecile&quot; written on it. The
&gt;&gt; clumsy fool bumped the switch as he got up, accidentally
&gt;&gt; lowering it another notch.  Thus notroll's mental works ended
&gt;&gt; up, by comparison to a normal human, dimmmer, dimmer, dimmer,
&gt;&gt; dimmer, dimmer, dimmer and dimmer.

&gt;&gt; Now of course imbecile notroll will believe that's exactly
&gt;&gt; what happened to him, since he can't understand what I said
&gt;&gt; about this being just a simplistic model of the real
&gt;&gt; misadventure that provided the idiot for my amusement.

It’s hilarious that you haven’t figured out what’s happening to
you here.  Whenever I feel like it, I slap you into another
demonstration of the fact that you’re 100% unable to handle
newsgroup bullshit--and furthermore that you wouldn’t have balls
enough to try even if you were able.   That alone would show that
you’re a slower life form even among your cretin peers, but I
also manipulate you into endlessly repeating wildly infantile
remarks like those.  Even now that I’ve explained it to you,
you’re way too dumb to understand it.  This is fun.

You left out “trailer,” shitforbrains.  Don’t let that happen
again until next week.
