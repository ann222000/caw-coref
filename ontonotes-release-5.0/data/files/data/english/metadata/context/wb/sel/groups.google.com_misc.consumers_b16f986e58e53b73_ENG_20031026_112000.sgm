I will premise my remarks by stating that the behavior of the financial
institution was not wrong, or at least not illegal. That said, caution is
advised!

Being one of those who pays 100% of the card amount off every month, I used to
laugh at those &quot;notice of billing changes&quot; that have been appearing with
somewhat alarming regularity amongst all the various pitches for credit life,
catalog merchandise and other assorted come-ons.

Printed in very fine type have been changes to the card terms that clearly show
the pressure banks are under to show ever increasing revenue from their card
holders. Late fees, near ursurous interest rates and other assorted charges
including those for processing of electronic payments initiated by the card
company are common on many accounts.

My bank (not the card issuing bank) recently implemented free, web based bill
payment. Having never been enticed by the Check-free subscription scheme, I
thought it might be useful to see how much benefit there would be in paying
bills electronically.

Late one Friday night (the 12th of the month), I proceeded to create an
electronic payment for my bank card, whos issuing name shall remain nameless,
but used to be known informally as &quot;FU&quot; - wonder why? Web based payments take 4
days - but that's 4 business days, which means the payment was not expected to
be made until the 17th. In fact, it was made a day early on the 16th.

Unfortunately, I hadn't paid that close attention to the payment due date: the
14th. This on a statement date of the 25th. Long gone are the days when a
payment due date is a suggestion, and payment made by the billing date
considered to be on time.

FU was quite happy to slap a $35 late fee as well as $14 in interest charges on
the account. Once the &quot;interest clock&quot; starts running, it's very difficult to
stop it. Paying the balance due previously (even a day or two late) does not
stop the clock. You also need to pay all the current charges as soon as
possible. Of course, you don't find out the clock is running until your
statement arrives, at which time you are already 2 weeks into the next billing
period and thus 6 weeks into interest accruals. Needless to say, a second full
balance payment was made immediately, but I fully expect to see more interest
charges.

One of the many new features of FU creadit cards is dynamic interest rates. You
see, when you start using one of the features they really want you to use,
borrowing money so you can pay them interest, you all of a sudden become a
credit risk and they reserve the right to bump your interest rates from an
astronomical ~21% to a rather astounding ~30%. So I fully expect to see the
effects of this poicy on my next statement. Fortunately, this is a one time
oversight that will not be repeated...

Jury is still out on web payments. I like not having to print checks, but am
waiting to see what the error rate is...

"/> Checkfree actually offers free bill payment for selected banks
(and utilities) who they have agreements with, including
Citibank, Chase and First USA. They get your statement, and you
can pay it from Mycheckfree.com. My big complaint with them is
that while you can set it up to automatically pay your bill
(hooray), the only option is to have it pay the minimum amount
due. They should offer you the option of having them
automatically pay the full amount. For utility bills, they do
pay the full amount.

"/> Yes, long gone, and if you are just becoming aware of that, it's
your own fault.

Anyway, if your bill was due on the 14th and you paid it on the
12th, that means you sat on the bill for at least a week, likely
two before paying it online. 20 days between statement close and
payment due are the norm at many banks. And it's not like the
hide the fact, the due date is printed on the statement.

Now, what you should have done was gone to First USA's website,
where you could have paid the bill, and it might have been
credited as paid immediately (I'm not positive).

There was no error here, except that you paid your bill too
late. What do you think would have happened if you mailed a

even later.

two days. Better.

But the more important question here is not when you get the

account. In the case of American Express, that is *immediately.*
This is crucial if you are up against a payment due date, or nearing
your maximum credit limit.

A good thing to know.

they have to mail it, it will still get there in time. With

"/> Look, if you are paying the bill from your bank (as opposed to
pulling the payment from your credit card's website), the
payment is not going to be immediate. Best case it will be
processed and credited the following business day. Worst case
they will have to mail a check or the payee does not credit it
that day but takes an extra day to process the electronic
payment.

If you had made the payment from the First USA website, you
would have stood a MUCH better chance of avoiding the late fee
than you did by sending it from your bank. That was your final
mistake, once you forgot to pay the bill on time. You probably
could have called their 800 number and made a payment by phone
as well, but there is likely a fee for that and it probably
would not have been credited any faster than if you had paid it
from their (FU's) website.

the money for 4 days to make interest off it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;they tell you 4 days in advance so they
&gt;are covered one way or the other.

"/> No they tell you 4 days so they get the use of your money for 4 days before
paying the bill. Wake up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If they can pay it
&gt;electronically, it will be credited by the following day.

"/> Electronic payments are immediate. No excuse for the next day crap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If
&gt;they have to mail it, it will still get there in time.

"/> Again someone who thinks they have people in a room writing checks and sending
them through the mail. With all the people using electronic biil pay it would
take thousnads of workers to make out and mail checks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;With
&gt;Quicken and Checkfree, you tell them when it's due, and they
&gt;count backwards based on the payment type and figure out when to
&gt;send it.

"/> Sure they do. All the workers writing these checks stop and count backwards
just to make sure your payment gets there on time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Give us proof, idiot.

"/> Okay lying moron, here it is. Hope it helps you to get you head out of your
ass which might be hard considering I just broke my foot off in it.

There were several payments over the
decade that were either &quot;lost&quot; or posted late by the payee. In all
those cases Citibank quickly and efficiently resolved the problems and
either got the payee to reverse any late fees, or reimbursed me for
them directly. In all cases Citibank produced checks or electronic
payment records issued on correct dates, so the very few problems that
occurred over an entire decade were all on the receiving end, or due
to postal service problems.

Also, I haven't experienced ANY problems in the last 2-3 years
(compared to about one problem per year earlier), so I believe that
the payees have adjusted their payment processing systems and
processes to accommodate bill-payment services. By the way, I'm quite
a high-volume bill sender, having on average 8-10 active credit
accounts of various types at any given time, as well as the usual
number of utilities accounts, doctors' offices, mortgages, etc...

BLAM!

&gt;Bullcrap. They tell you 4 days because they float the money. The banks hold
&gt;the money for 4 days to make interest off it.

"/> Maybe from your bank - not from mine. If I tell my bank to make an electronic
payment, the money gets removed the date

1) The electronic transfer is completed OR
2) The date the payee presents a check that the bank sent them.

There is no float.
