Our 1994 XJ 40 4.0L (86K on the clock and bought one year ago) has had
the characteristic smoke cloud (valve stem oil seals relarted) but over
the last year this has reduced dramatically.  The cars history includes
7 years with only 17K miles inc one year with only 600 miles.  Since we
bought it (one year ago) I have given it a real thrashing at least once
a day and the car loves it, the engine loves it and I have to say I do
too.  It would appear that the 10K miles in the last year inc motorway
work has done the engine the world of good.  However, I have heard
rumours that there may be an oil additive that will help re-soften the
oil seals and therefore attenuate the (now) slight blue "puff".  I am
currently of the belief that the only cure is a cylinder head revamp
but am open to suggestions. In my experience, once you take an engine
apart in any way it is never the same again. Does anyone know about any
truth in this rumour?

I have a 1988 XJ40, and like yours -- it puffs blue smoke in the morning.
Actually, it is slightly more than a puff but not much.  There is no "snake
oil" additive cure for the problem.  Usually, anything you add will create
problems, not eliminate them.  Keep in mind that anything you add to change
the characteristics of one set of seals will change the characteristics of
ALL the seals that it comes in contact with.  That may "cure" one problem
and make others.

Most owners of XJ40s fix the seals when they do the inevitable head gasket
replacement.  I have been fortunate, however in that I now have 208,000
miles on the clock with the same slight puff and the same head gasket.  If I
were you, I would just learn to live with it for now as it is really doing
no harm

Thank you vey much.  As the car has just had its MOT with perfect
emissions results for the cat I am very inclined to agree.  I think
that the (now) one litre per 10k miles oil consumption, which can live
with, I think I shall leave thngs alone.
Once again thnk you!

Hi,

Truly the puff of smoke is more of an annoyance then it is a sign of
trouble. A little oil drooling down the vavles is ok by me.
