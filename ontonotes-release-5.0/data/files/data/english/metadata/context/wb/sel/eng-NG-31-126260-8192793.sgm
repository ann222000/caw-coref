we're facing as a family the decision to move from an HMO+FSA health insurance to an
HSA

the Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is used with the HMO plan to pay for anything not
covered by the HMO, such as dental and eyeglasses and deductibles like office visits

in reading some of the Health Savings Account (HSA) literature, it appears there is a
restriction that to be eligible, one can not be claimed as dependent on someone else's
tax return

while we file a joint return, one of our children is claimed as dependent (under 24)
and is currently covered by our HMO and FSA as he is a full time student while working
part time at the university. does that mean he would not be covered by the HSA ?

the other part the literature mentions is that the money grows in the HSA like an IRA
but does one have investment choices on this money? or does that refer to just some
money market like interest paid on the balance?

morningstar had a short HSA commentary today
http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=199639&amp;pgid;=ww...

would it also make sense to pre-load a larger contribution to the HSA for the 1st year
one enrolls and then use that as a &quot;bank&quot; while reducing future years contributions
slightly ? anything else to consider about HSA rules ?

I can only speak to this one part of your query. The answer will depend on
whom you have the
HSA with. Some may have restrictions in the investment area, others DO NOT.

Generally speaking you are permitted to invest some portion of the HSA
Savings account in a mutual fund. That choice MAY be restricted. You will
need to inquire of the HSA Administrator.

That is correct, your dependent can't open his own HSA, but you can open
one that includes your dependent in the coverage.

There are annual limits to what you can contribute, tied to the amount
of the HDHP (high-deductible health plan) you have, so &quot;pre-loading&quot;
isn't allowed.  If you are going to use the HSA at all, I imagine you'd
always want to make the maximum contribution allowed.

Is  your decision being driven by losing employer-provided group health
coverage for one or both of you?  I'm guess family coverage through your
employer if available will be a better deal than an HSA.  On the other
hand, if your health remains good, you can use the balance in the HSA
for any purpose, not just medical expenses, without additional penalty
after age 65.

You might want to spend some time with IRS Pub 969 to learn more.  Also
check your state rules; California for example does not allow HSA's and
treats them like ordinary savings accounts (no deduction for
contributions, earnings are taxable).

I think the issue here is people throw around HSA to mean the health
plan also. But in reality, it's a combination of HDP (high deductible
health plan) + HSA (health savings account). The HSA is under your
name -- the HDP plan covers you and your kids. So the rule would be
the owner of the HDP + HSA cannot be claimed as a dependent. For the
people you cover with this plan and use the HSA to pay the
deductibles, their only requirement is that they are not covered by
another health insurance plan.

This is dependent on each HSA administrator. Again, not the health
plan but the people at the bank/mutual fund company that manages the
account. Typically, most HSA administrators will require you to have
about $2000+ or 1 years worth of deductibles before you can transfer
the overage to mutual funds. Some HSA administrators don't have limits
but will charge fees for low money market/savings account balances.
And rare few don't care.

For example, my company is going with Patelco Credit Union. They only
have savings accounts paying 5%+. However, they have no minimum
balance requirement. Since I'm in complete control of the account, I
can at any time transfer any amount I want to Health Saving
Administrators (the company) to buy Vanguard mutual funds. Health
Savings Administrators (the company) is designed to be an add-on
account to your regular HSA account so they don't have any balance
minimums for investments.

Part 1: No, you can pay out of pocket and have until forever to repay
yourself out of HSA contributions. So it terms of paying deductibles,
it doesn't matter if you pre-fund or post-fund.

Part 2: Yes, you want as much tax-free growth as soon as possible.
Change your view of the HSA -- it's a super-IRA so fund it before
anything else. It may very well be even better than a 401K w/ matching
(depending on how much match and the quality of investments). When
spent on medical, it's the only tax vehicle that is free from taxes
both on contribution and withdrawal -- hence you are getting matching
from the federal+state government equal to your combined tax bracket.
Employer matching on funds would make it the ultimate retirement
account. Hence, plan your investments around the HSA and aim for fully
funding the HSA every year.

Not so, because the FSA (flexible spending account, a.k.a. Section 125)
he already has is exactly the same -- free from taxes on contributions
and withdrawals when used for medical.

Compared to individual health insurance premiums and itemized deductions
(Schedule A), the HSA is probably a better deal, but only because of the
limits imposed on medical itemized deductions.  Compared to
employer-subsidized group health coverage including an FSA, not so clear.

Be careful when comparing to an IRA. While there are some similarities
(especially if you have a balance available at age 65), the HSA unlike
an IRA is strongly tied to your medical expenses.  You have to pay HDHP
premiums, and if you have *any* medical expenses (not just co-pays, but
the whole bill) you're going to be drawing down the balance to pay them.

It's hard to see how you are going to realistically build up a
significant balance in the HSA.  A younger single person in excellent
health, then maybe yes.

Sure. You just have to know beforehand how much you plan on spending
every year on medical. Plan too much, lose money you don't use. Plan
too little, pay out of pocket and take the tax hit.

Let's be honest here. Employer-subsidized group health coverage is
coming from your salary -- it's part of your total compensation
package. If your employer cancelled health insurance, would you not
raise holy hell and probably quit? Likewise, if an employer switches
you to a HDP+HSA plan, you should demand they also contribute to your
HSA -- otherwise, it's a paycut.

I'll give you the numbers for my company. Our previous insurance plan
was 90% coverage from Blue Shield and premiums were about $11K/yr per
employee. Switching to a 2400/4800 plan from Blue Cross drops our
premiums to $5K/yr per employee. The difference alone funds HSAs for
every employee up to the IRS max with still leftovers for company cost
savings.

Annual contributions for an HSA is $2850 for a single person, $5650
for a family. To open an HSA, you only need to be in a plan with
deductibles of $1100/single, $2200/family. Assuming out of pocket max
is 50% more than the deductible -- that means funding the max means
you will get at least $1000/$2000 every year even if you have a ton of
medical bills. 3 years out of 5 with just standard doctor visits and
now you're looking at an accumulation of about $8K/$17K for single/
family.

If you have a higher deductible plan with out-of-pocket near/above the
HSA contribution limits, yes that would mean having max medical
expenses every year would zero out your HSA accounts. But that also
means your premium savings should be much bigger. (Or your employer is
profitting from the plan switch and you need to demand a cut of that
money.) And you still should be maxing it out just to reap the tax
benefits.

True, but in something like 10 years I don't think I ever forfeited a
penny and only had minimal uncovered costs.  With typical family
expenses (orthodontia and vision care come to mind) you have quite a bit
of control.

Stop there.  You can only contribute up to the amount of your

As for your additional comment, yes I agree an employer might push
employees into HSA's to try to reduce their commitment to providing
group health care as part of compensation, just like they did with
401k's vs. traditional pensions.

My main quibble was your comment that an HSA is a &quot;super IRA&quot;.  I'm
pretty sure the intent of the law was not to have this be a &quot;better
replacement&quot; for an IRA, and for the most part I think the limitations
succeed in doing just that.  Also don't forget my comment on state tax
issues (such as California does not recognize HSAs).

First, your point wasn't all that similar - and I thought we agreed it
was &quot;boggle&quot;;).

Second, I know some employers do offer compensation for switching plans
(or charge less, which is the same thing).  For example, my wife's
employer offers both an HMO plan and an HDHP+HSA plan, both of which are
paid for via payroll deductions.  But the HDHP+HSA has a lower cost to
her.  We looked closely at both plans.  It seems that the HDHP+HSA plan
is mainly suitable for people who either infrequently need health care,
and thus can save on the premium, or who need a lot of heath care, and
thus will end up paying more in co-payments and co-insurance with the
HMO than with the HDHP+HSA, even considering the deductible.  We fall
somewhere in between, so we didn't go with the HDHP+HSA.

On 11/12/06 I posted: &quot;If I were offered 10% for my money, I'd run the

And Mark Replied : &quot;Unless, of course, it were a 50% &quot;immediate return

So three points, (1) Mark (and I) agree that any employee benefit is
part of the pay package, and some people may not take advantage of it
all, esp in the of 401(k) matching. (2) it's 'bozzle'. (3) I need a life.

Thanx, I certainly missed that one.  So yes, this change would make it
somewhat more likely that one could actually accumulate a &quot;significant&quot;
balance in an HSA over a number of years, similar to a Traditional IRA
(but still nowhere near what you can accumulate in a 401k with its
higher limits).

I still don't see how it's a &quot;super IRA&quot; or &quot;the ultimate retirement
account&quot; &quot;even better than a 401K w/ matching&quot; that one should &quot;plan
[their] investments around&quot; as was claimed in wyu's first post. I still
see it as just one of several ways to deduct medical expenses from
taxable income, not &quot;the only tax-free vehicle&quot;.  Unless I'm missing
something (again), withdrawals used for other than medical expenses are
still taxable income (plus a 10% penalty if under age 65).

I was making this point that it does everything an IRA does but more.
If you use it for medical, it tax-free contributing, tax-free
withdrawal. If you don't use it for medical during retirement, then it
acts like an IRA. Studies show that medical is a HUGE expense during
retirement so why would you use a HSA for non-medical and then use
your IRA/401K for medical? Switch it around, save it for medical and
given how people's lifespans are getting extended by medicine, it's as
good as tax-free as long as you can avoid dipping into it for non-
medical.

Now my statement about better than 401K w/ matching was:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It may very well be even better than a 401K w/ matching (depending on how much match and the quality of investments).
">

An employer might give you matching but it could be (1) a small amount
or (2) the 401K plan is truly horrible. It happens that employers get
sold some high expense plan (free to the employer, expensive to the
participants) that has 2%-3% ER insurance wrapper funds. And the
employees have no choice. The existence of that plan probably will
mean they can't contribute to their own Traditional IRA even if they
decline participation in the 401K.

Meanwhile, a HSA is totally under the control of employees whether the
money is funded by themselves or the employer. They can at any time
transfer money to better investments/lower fees. So for money that
will be used for medical expenses (which will happen for almost
everybody), you are getting a match equal to your tax bracket. Would I
fund an HSA before a putting money into a crappy 401K plan with high
expenses and long vesting periods for matching? I certainly would.

Suppose you have $1K in your HSA, $1K in spare cash (taxable account), and
$1K in current medical expenses.  What do you do?

If you pay out of the HSA, then your taxable account grows (with taxes
bleeding off returns), and the remaining gain is taxed when you use it to
pay for medical expenses later in life (after you have reached 65 and can no
longer contribute to your HSA).

On the other hand, if you pay your current bill out of the taxable account,
the HSA account grows tax free until you pay for medical expenses later in
life.  The gains (that would have been taxed in the taxable account) have
completely escaped taxation.  So it effectively lets you convert post-tax
money (the $1K in your taxable account) into a &quot;Roth&quot; that grows tax-free.

Of course, if you don't use it for medical expenses, you could come out
worse, since you'd be paying taxes on the original contribution that you
wouldn't have paid had they been used on qualified expenses.

&gt; I was making this point that it does everything an IRA does but more.
&gt; If you use it for medical, it tax-free contributing, tax-free
&gt; withdrawal. If you don't use it for medical during retirement, then it
&gt; acts like an IRA. Studies show that medical is a HUGE expense during
&gt; retirement so why would you use a HSA for non-medical and then use
&gt; your IRA/401K for medical? Switch it around, save it for medical and
&gt; given how people's lifespans are getting extended by medicine, it's as
&gt; good as tax-free as long as you can avoid dipping into it for non-
&gt; medical.

Sorry if I'm beating the proverbial dead horse here.  I'm not knocking
HSA's, in fact I plan to start one if and when I'm no longer covered
under an employer group plan.

I agree that the portability and accumulation aspects of HSA's are
unique and valuable.

I'm really just trying to make two points, which I promise not to make
again in this thread:

1) medical expenses are _already_ tax free if you handle them through
your employer (employer contribution to group health, your share of the
group health, and flex spending account -- all tax free).  HDHP/HSA is
just another flavor of the same thing that has been around for a long
time -- a flavor that is better for some and worse for others. Sole
proprietors also get tax free self-employed health insurance deduction,
comparable to what they could get through an employer.

2) even if you fund an HSA to the max, I think it would be dangerous to
assume that that the same contribution does double duty, once for
medical expenses and once for retirement.  It might work out that way if
you know right now that you (and your family) are going to be very
healthy for the next twenty years -- not a risk I would advise anyone to
take.

I think you are too fixed on the issue of an HSA being used up for
medical. To explain my point more clearly, let's look at the
alternatives instead. Let's say you have access to both an IRA and a
HSA but you only have enough money to contribute to one of them.

Option 1: IRA contributions only
A) Lots of medical expenses before retirement. You pay income tax +
penalty. Maybe you can avoid the penalty if you qualify for the
hardship clauses.
B) Medical expenses during retirement. You pay income tax.
C) You remain healthy for the rest of your life and spend your IRA
money for non-medical retirement. You pay income tax.
D) You have non medical emergencies before retirement. You pay tax +
penalty.

Option 2: HSA contributions only
A) Lots of medical expenses before retirement. No tax, no penalty.
B) Medical expenses during retirement. No tax, no penalty.
C) You remain healthy for the rest of your life and spend your IRA
money for non-medical retirement. You pay income tax.
D) You have non medical emergencies before retirement. You pay tax +
penalty.

So what I'm getting at has nothing to do with HSA money possibly doing
double-duty. It has everything to do with the alternatives being not
as good. Only in scenario C &amp; D do you have equal results. In
scenarios A &amp; B, the HSA is clearly the better option. Yes, A &amp; B will
mean reducing your HSA balance to deal with medical expenses but it's
better reducing the balance and paying tax+penalty ontop of that.
Obviously, if you can contribute to both, do both. But since HSA does
all the scenarios as good or better than an IRA, it should be your
first contribution target.

&gt; More to the point, the way I read it, Pub 969 says qualified expenses for
&gt; an HSA are those documented in Pub 502.

However, that's not an exhaustive list.  As the Treasury Dept writes:
&quot;A *partial* list is provided in IRS Pub 502.&quot;
http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/faq_using.shtml#hsa2

The actual HSA statute, 26 USC 223(d)(2) defines the term &quot;qualified medical
expense&quot; for an HSA as &quot;amounts paid ... for medical care (as defined in
section 213(d)(1))&quot; without verbiage regarding time of expense.
http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=26&amp;sec;=223

[213(d)(1) defines medical expenses as expenses for diagnosis, cure, etc.
http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=26&amp;sec;=213 ]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another reinforcing instruction: Form 8889 says qualifying expenses are
&gt; those you could otherwise deduct on Schedule A.  That implies current year
&gt; only.

Be careful.  The instructions say &quot;*Generally*&quot;.  For example, the
instructions neglect to mention that OTC drugs are qualified expenses (same
as for 125 plans), even though they are excluded from Schedule A.
http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/faq_using.shtml#hsa1

The only clear statement, one way or the other, that I've been able to find
is this Treasury Dept presentation, May 18, 2007 (see p. 30).  But public
affairs presentations are hardly authoritative:

&quot;HSA Distributions can be used to reimburse prior years' expenses as long as
they were incurred on or after the date the HSA was established.
- No time limit on when distribution must occur
- Individual must keep [sufficient] records ...&quot;

Hmmm, I was thinking in my head the scenario of small medical bills
now or big medical bills later in life. And since multiplication is
commutative, it doesn't matter whether you take 20% out of today's
balance or 20% out later in life.

But the idea of first paying from taxable and then reimbursing from
HSA after many tax-deferred years of growth is interesting. Obviously,
the taxable accounts would take a hit but how much would the tax-
deferred growth offset it? I may have to build a spreadsheet to run
the numbers.

While you're working on this, maybe Joe's ideas on planning for the Social
Security bump in tax rates should come into play. It seems to me that being
able to take some tax-free dollars would offset some of that, no?

Well, good luck with that.  HSA's have only been around a few years, and
Congress has been known to close loopholes in tax laws.  But I respect
the thought and research that has gone into this.

I don't want to be the one who has an IRS auditor looking at my
qualified HSA distribution claiming twenty-plus years' worth of
paid-but-unreimbursed family medical deductions!

Maybe I'm not viewing it correctly, but the way I see it, you start with
$2X dollars - $X in the HSA, $X in the taxable.  You have $X in expenses.
Regardless of where the money comes from, you pay your expenses and have $X
left, right now.  The only question is what do you have many years from now.

If your X dollars are sitting in a taxable account, then the gain is taxed
(along the way and/or when you sell off).  If your X dollars are sitting in
the HSA, then they gain the same amount (assuming same investment choices),
but the gain is tax-free (assuming it is spent on medical expenses).  It
seems like a no-brainer.

Same idea as a Roth.  You have $X on which no more taxes are due (post-tax).
You can keep it in a taxable account or put it into a Roth.  Which is
better?  Obviously by putting it into the Roth your taxable account takes a
hit.  But you have $X either way, and if put into a Roth, the gain never
gets taxed.

There are two gotchas:

1) The HSA money must be spent on medical expenses (should be easy, but not
guaranteed)

2) You have to have the extra cash up front - $2X instead of $X, so that you
can both pay current expenses out of pocket, and fund the HSA.  I believe
this is the big stumbling block for most people.

(Remember, over 90% of people do not fully fund their IRAs.
