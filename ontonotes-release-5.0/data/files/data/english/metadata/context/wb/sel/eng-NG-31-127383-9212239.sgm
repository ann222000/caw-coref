When it is necessary to give a schwa a distinct quality, how is it
determined what quality to give it? For example, a speech synthesizer
would presumably need to produce a schwa as a vowel with some quality
it decides on; it hardly seems possible for it to produce a vowel with
indistinct quality. Is the quality based purely on the surrounding
context (such as the articulation of the consonants adjacent to the
schwa) or is it different for different languages?

The reason why I ask is that while this metric restoration of the Rig
Veda seems a remarkable piece of work, the qualities of some of the
restored vowels jars one's senses; when I hear a trisyllabic rendition
of Indra, it always has a closed schwa making it something like
[indI&quot;r@] or at any rate, no more open than [inde&quot;r@].

The name &quot;índra&quot;, similarly, is often trisyllabic, &quot;índara&quot;.

&quot;Indistinct quality&quot; vowels are defined and cataloged, aren't they,
like IPA 317 or 316 or also slightly lower. Depending on the language,
you have well-defined orthography for it, too, like the Turkish
dotless i or the Armenian It, etc. so calling it &quot;schwa&quot; regardless of
circumstance won't fly. As for the English so-called &quot;schwa&quot; of the
unstressed vowels, as a foreigner I can't call it that name because
the same phoneme is indistinct noise in one native mouth and crystal-
clear, well-defined short vowel in another.

Strange that it should jar for you: I have no idea of Hindi (or any of
the area languages) but can hear speakers of it at my workplace insert
a very clear 317 in words like Chit317ra, -put317ra, etc. everyday.

It looks like I didn't express myself well enough.
317 is what I hear too. What I'm jarred by is seeing 317 spelt as &lt;a&gt;
rather than with a grapheme similar to &lt;I&gt;. The jarring example I gave
was &lt;indara&gt; which spelling erroneously suggests to the uninitiated
(non-Indian) reader that the first &lt;a&gt; is pronounced as 322 or 324.

Come to think of it, the 2nd &lt;a&gt; presents a problem too; a masculine
ending 322 ought to be distinguished from a feminine ending pronounced
as 324 where I'm from (although it's 305 elsewhere). So, I think there
ought to be 3 central vowel graphemes &lt;I&gt;, &lt;@&gt; and &lt;a&gt; rather than
have all of them written as &lt;a&gt;.

Looks like a peculiarly Indian problem, or rather a transcription
problem possibly caused by the short-long vowel orthography in your
scripts.

That is the problem in other words like Hindi &lt;apna&gt; but in this word,
the vowel is entirely epenthetic (there's no vowel there when the
chanting doesn't require an extra syllable and the cantor uses a
Pandit pronunciation), so it would be well for some convention like
ind'ra. ind.ra or ind!ra to be used to show the vowel introduced just
for metre. 317 used to be a&lt;circumflex&gt; in Romanian but has been
changed to a much more sensible (IMHO) i&lt;circumflex&gt;.
