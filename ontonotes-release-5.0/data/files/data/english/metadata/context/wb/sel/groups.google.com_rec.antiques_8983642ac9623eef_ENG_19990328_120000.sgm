Hello all!

Question about refininshing antique furniture:

Is it ok to use Miniwax Antique Refinisher to get the top layer of shelac,
etc, off of the original finish and then follow up with either Antique Oil
Finish or Tung Oil? Will using the refinisher product devalue the antique
at all? It doesn't remove the finish, just the gunk from the years of use
(if I understand correctly).

Please respond.

Thanks!

Michael

"/> Please tell me you don't own any antiques, and that this is a piece of
C20th shite you're talking about...

Cheers, Laurie.

Any &quot;refinisher&quot; is bound to remove a little of the cellosolve soluble
film finish from the furniture. They work by dissolving the finish a bit
and as you wipe, it smears it around, hopefully creating a new smooth
finish. Some is bound to stick to the cloth you use. The worst situation
occurs when the finish has some color in it, excluding things like orange
shellac. The refinisher will smear the color around but not redistribute it
as evenly as it was. It could look pretty bad.
If you do not get all the shellac off, an oil finish will not soak into
the wood and will end up creating a sticky mess. Minwax Antique Oil Finish
is actually a mixture of tung oil, mineral spirits (or some other thinner),
and varnish. I believe that this could be used on top of shellac since it
will cure. If you're interested, you should try it in an inconspicuous
place.
It is my opinion that a refinishing solution will devalue an antique.
The patina is made up of the scratches and dirt embedded in the finish.
Redissolve it and you certainly will lose the scratch pattern and will
probably redistribute the dirt. If you are determined to remove the
shellac, why not repeatedly wipe it down with alcohol? Shellac dissolves in
it. Again, try it in a non-vital area first.
If you want to &quot;remove the gunk from years of use&quot;, try either a dilute
solution of mild dishwashing liquid in warm water quickly followed by drying
with a clean cloth followed by a washing in mineral spirits or try a
waterless gritless handcleaner followed by mineral spirits. If you feeling
brave, you can lightly use some 4/0 steel wool with the hand cleaner.
Either way, try these methods in an inconspicuous place first.
Good Luck.

"/> It depends on the importance of the piece. Most of the items we Americans
call antiques are usually not devalued by refinishing. In general, it needs
to be an important piece for it to loose value.

What are the ingredients of the refinisher. They aren't all alike. Most
refinishers dissolve the finish. Using refinisher can be tricky. Regular
stripper would probably work better. Of course, your results will depend on
your skill level. The main trick to refinishing is patience. A good refernce
for refinishing is &quot;Understanding Wood Finishing&quot; by Bob Flexner
