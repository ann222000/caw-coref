If you throw a cat out a car window, does it become kitty litter?

If there is no God, who pops up the next kleenex in the box?

How did a fool and his money GET together?

How do they get deer to cross at that yellow road sign?

If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?

How do you know when it is time to tune your bagpipes?

Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny?

When you choke a smurf, what color do they turn?

Does fuzzy logic tickle?

Do they have reserved parking for non-handicapped people at the special
olympics?

Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one?

Do radioactive cats have 18 half-lives?

If you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer?

Can fat people go skinny-dipping?

If a book about failures doesn't sell, is it a success?

If a stealth bomber crashes in the forest, does it make a sound?

If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain
silent?

If a parsley farmer is sued, can they garnish his wages?

Why do people sing &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; when they're already
there?

Why do people say &quot;tuna fish?&quot; They don't say &quot;beef mammal&quot; or &quot;chicken
bird!&quot;

What's another word for synonym?

So what's the speed of dark?

Is reading in the bathroom considered Multi-Tasking?

If the universe is everything, and scientists say that the universe is
expanding, what is it expanding into?

Why do they call it the Department of Interior when they are in charge
of everything outdoors?

We have the same problem here in BC. I can't understand the logic behind
it, though. Protecting a sub-species like tourists leads to over

Hehehe, speaking of tourists:

In high school, I worked over the summers at a sporting goods store, for
a friend of the family.

One day, a couple comes in and browses around the store.

The gentleman approaches me at the counter, leans over, and asks, very
slowly, in a loud voice, &quot;DO YOU TAKE AMERICAN MONEY?&quot;

After explaining that yes, we did accept American currency, that in
fact, we preferred it, and also the fact that we actually *do* speak
English, I found out he was from the *US!*, the &quot;Lower 48&quot;, as we call
it.  I don't remember now what state he was from, but apparently they
don't edumacate them very well there.

&lt;sigh&gt;

If ignorance is bliss, that guy must have been ecstatic.

Some do...LOL  You just have to remember where you have sticked them and
also remember to read them.

So *thats* the problem!

Deb has actually threatened to have reminders tattooed, backwards, on my
forehead, so I can read them in the mirror.

The problem with that solution, though, is that I really don't give a
hoot what other people think about my appearance.  Since I'm out of the
jacket &amp; tie world of my last job, and into the shorts &amp; t-shirt world
of home, I don't have much use for a mirror.

I'll shave, every few days, when my arms feel up to it.  I've found that
it really takes a lot of effort these days.  Just to shave, for cryin'
out loud!  My arms feel totally wiped out by the time I'm finished.  I'd
quit shaving altogether, except that Deb *really* doesn't like it when I
have a beard.

&lt;sigh&gt;

I think its because I look, oh, I don't know, maybe 20 years younger
without the beard.  I think that if I look older, it reminds her that
she is getting older.  She is approaching the big 5-0 next year and I've
noticed a slight obsession with that.  &quot;Oh, I can't do that, its too
hard, I'm almost 50 you know!&quot;  I keep telling her that you are as young
as you feel.  Who knows, maybe one of these days it will sink in?

Myself, I think I'm reverting back to my teen years, or at least I keep
trying.  Or maybe its just wishful thinking.  :-)

Umm, OK, now that I've drifted completely off-off-topic, I guess I'll
stop here.  Funny how that happens around here, isn't it?  :-)

&gt; Alex, tell her life begins at 50. I celebrated, told people I
&gt; could say what I liked now that I was 50. I was working in NICU
&gt; at the time and they had a party for me at work, balloons, cake
&gt; and lots of laughs. It was great.

&gt; And I still feel like 25 or 30 most days unless the arthritis is
&gt; really hitting badly or my MS is acting up. Most of it is in the
&gt; mind. And mirrors? Pshaw. Lines are marks of milestones,
&gt; achievements and life lived.

&gt; My .02 worth.

Thats what I keep trying to tell her.  Ah well, I'm sure that
*eventually* it will sink in.  I've learned some great nagging techniques.

From her.  :-)

Joan, on the matter of &quot;words of wisdom,&quot; I speak them whenever my
Betty permits. On matters of humor, anytime I speak my words of wisdom
. . . and my Betty laughs. It is a wise man that has a happy wife.
