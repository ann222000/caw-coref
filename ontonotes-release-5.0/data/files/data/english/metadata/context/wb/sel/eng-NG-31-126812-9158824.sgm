A  Charde

Lets network this information by sending it to all  your
friends. We need to let Senator Menendez (Democrat,  NJ)
understand that Irish America wishes  to
STOP THE DEPORTATIONS OF FORMER IRISH  POLITICAL PRISONERS.

The department of home land security will deport  Malachy
McAllister and his young family in two weeks from now if we
do not  act. This is their last chance so please help this
deserving  family.

From: Margaret Townsend
Subject: IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED TO HELP McALLISTER  FAMILY

The McAllisters are a Catholic family from Northern Ireland
who  have been seeking political asylum in the United States
since 1996.

On  October 2, 1988, two masked loyalist gunmen smashed the
front window of the  McAllister home and fired 26 shots into
the house narrowly missing three of  the McAllister children
and their grandmother, who was minding them. Malachy  and
his wife, Bernadette (who has since died of cancer in
2004), were not  home at the time.

They were later notified by the Royal Ulster  Constabulary
that Malachy's security information was found in a  loyalist
'safe house' along with the guns used in the shooting.

This  information confirmed that the McAllisters were being
deliberately targeted  and that the loyalist attack had been
planned in collusion with the security  forces. Other
members of the McAllister's family had also been  targeted.
Theresa Clinton, a relative, was murdered when loyalists
fired  shots into her living room. Bernadette's family
members had been warned by  the RUC to take security
precautions because, like Malachy, their personal  details
were in the hands of paramilitary organizations.

The threats  have followed the McAllisters even here to the
United States. In 2005, a  loyalist terror group called the
Red Hand Defenders emailed a threat against  the McAllisters
to the Irish Echo newspaper stating that, &quot;We won't  miss
next time.&quot;

It is not clear why the government has chosen to  proceed in
the McAllister case, while suspending action on many of  the
other Irish 'deportee' cases. The McAllisters have had the
constant  support of a number of our Congressmen and
Senators, whose intervention  resulted in a 'suspension of
order of removal'.

Unfortunately, that  stay expires in early September.
Congressman Steven Rothman introduced a  private bill in the
House.

Now the McAllisters only hope may be if  Senator Menendez
will introduce legislation in the Senate to delay  or
suspend the McAllister's deportation.

It is URGENT that we contact  Sen. Menendez NOW and we can
do that in any, or all, of the following  ways:

1. There is a letter below that can be printed and mailed
to the  senator's office.

2. Print the letter and fax it to him at 202-228-2197.  (If
you would like to mail or fax the letter please remember to
sign it  with your name and full address).

3. You can call his Washington office  at 202-224-4744 and
use the following script as a guide if you  like.

My name is ______. I live in _________, and I am a
member of the  Irish American Unity Conference.

I'm calling on behalf of Malachy  McAllister and his family.

I'm urging Senator Menendez to introduce  legislation in the
Senate immediately to protect the McAllister family  from
deportation.

*************************

(There are other  Irish American organizations who will also
be contacting the Senator's  office. Even so, you'll
sometimes get an aide on the phone who doesn't  know
anything about the issue so you may have to spell names for
them and  repeat the message so they get it down clearly).

Let's do all we can to  keep Malachy and his children here
in the U.S. so they can live in the peace  and safety they
deserve.

PROPOSED  LETTER:

September 1, 2007

The Honorable Robert Menendez
317  Hart Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator  Menendez,

As a member of the Irish American Unity Conference I am
well  aware of the invaluable support you have given to many
important Irish issues  and express my gratitude for your
constancy and courage. I am particularly  grateful for the
leadership role you assumed in defending Malachy  McAllister
and his family when they were first threatened with
deportation  some years ago. Sadly, that threat still looms
over the McAllister  family.

Malachy and his two youngest children are facing
deportation  when the suspension of their order of removal
expires in early September.  They have been advised by
Congressman Steven Rothman that a private bill in  the
Senate, similar to one attempted by Mr. Rothman in the
House, would be  their only hope to remain in New Jersey
with the older McAllister children  and their families.
This legislation is crucial to secure the safety of  Malachy
and his children.

The blatant threats of violence that have  been made against
the McAllister family still stands. Despite the  many
welcome improvements brought about by the Peace Process,
the reality  is that loyalist paramilitaries have refused to
decommission and are still  armed and threatening. Many
believe that if forced to return to Northern  Ireland the
McAllisters will once again be the targets of violence.

I  respectfully request that you give this matter your
immediate attention and  introduce legislation in the Senate
as soon as possible. Again, I thank you  for the courage
and leadership you have shown over the years in  addressing
many vital Irish issues.

Sincerely,
----
