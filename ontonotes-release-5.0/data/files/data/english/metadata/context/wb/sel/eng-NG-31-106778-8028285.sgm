FEEDING THE SNAKE
BY EMANUEL A. WINSTON, MID EAST ANALYST &amp; COMMENTATOR

Remember feeding a mouse to a snake in your high school Science class? You
pick it up by the tail and, as it squirms, you drop it into the snake's
cage. The snake is coiled up in the corner watching his meal, flicking his
forked tongue in and out, testing the air and then it slowly uncoils and
slithers toward his prey.

When I see America's Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice carrying out the
Bush-Baker plan to convene a Regional/International Conference with the
various Muslim Arab countries, I think that the State Department plans for
Israel to be the sacrificial mouse for the main course.

Condi picks up the wriggling Olmert (Israel current incompetent Prime
Minister) and drops him into the arena. Olmert is a pathetically stupid
mouse who bites his nails and doesn't know that he and all of Israel are to
be the main course in a High State banquet for the Islamists.

Israel was selected as the edible mouse (not Kosher) during the 1981 Madrid
Conference, arranged by then Secretary of State James Baker III and his
accommodating Jew-Boys, Dennis Ross, Aaron Miller and Dan Kurtzer.

Olmert and his cadre of incompetents seem to be unable to recognize their
peril - even to the point of being enthusiastic over being the center of
attention at the coming &quot;banquet&quot;. Regrettably, as in the fable of the Pied
Piper of Hamlin, he is leading the people, not over a cliff but straight
into the maw and belly of the Muslim snakes, that is &quot;states&quot;. Olmert is
said to be &quot;growing into the job&quot; except from a mouse he has grown into a
sewer rat (since sewer rats are larger and more repulsive than alley rats).

Can we rid ourselves of this wicked Pied Piper in lock-step with Rice, Baker
and the Arab snakes (states)? Why must the Jews of Israel allow an un-Jew
like Olmert to lead them to a terrible death?

Better the Jews gather and importune G-d with a proper &quot;Pulsa Denura&quot; prayer
asking for G-d to reach down and simply take him and his gaggle of Leftist
betrayers out of this world. There are many ways that this could be
accomplished without a Jew raising his hand if G-d intervened. Perhaps G-d
could arrange what happened to Korach and his supporters. The ground simply
opened and swallowed Korach. Or Olmert and his cohorts could join Arik
Sharon in adjoining beds, staring at the ceiling in a vegetative state!
Imagine! The entire ward could be filled with traitors to the State, all
paying their dues for treason as they join Sharon.

Olmert and his rodents seem unable to recognize their peril even to the
point of being enthusiastic about appearing in a grand International
Conference - dedicated by Rice and Baker to Israel's demise. Somehow, they
don't recognize that it will be Israel alone in front of a Kangaroo Court of
the world's nations - especially the most hostile, Muslim states.

I would have no problem if Olmert, Peres, Barak and the Kadima crowd have
elected to offer themselves up in ritual suicide. I would even write a
pleasant eulogy to their passing down the long gullet of the Muslim Arab
snakes. I would NOT however, tolerate that the people of Israel would also
be sacrificed with Olmert and his fools.

It is interesting to see that Israelis seem unable to learn from past
experiences, either with the Muslim Arabs or with the insidious Arabist
State Department. For the State Department the Saudis can do no wrong - even
as Saudis send terrorists into Iraq to kill Americans.

Remember that of the 19 suicide airplane bombers of 9/11/01, 15 were from
Saudi Arabia and 4 were Egyptian. But, the Bush Administration, knowing that
the Saudis are sending terrorists to Iraq still wants to sell them billions
of dollars worth of America's most advanced weapons.

In Israel they keep re-cycling the same politicians after the last scandal
had died down. Ehud Barak is back despite his craven retreat from Lebanon
and his begging Arafat to accept his offer of 97% of the Israeli territories
liberated in 1967.

Peres is back again in a very high position as President, where he has
already stepped out of the usual ceremonial role held by Israeli presidents
and has begun making Israeli foreign policies meetings and decisions NOT
within the president's job. This is after he sacrificed so many lives lost
and Israelis maimed for his treasonous secret Olso Accords.

Olmert stays in office after he and Sharon fed the snake the 21 communities
of Gush Katif/Gaza and 4 communities from North Samaria by evicting 10,000
Jewish men, women and children who had made the desert green and flowering.
Now Gaza is a Global Terror Base, as we and many other military analysts
predicted.

Instead of dragging Olmert out of his office for misfeasance and
malfeasance, he is being allowed to negotiate another Gush Katif type
evacuation from Judea and Samaria - with the Golan Heights, Jordan Valley
and those parts of Jerusalem which were occupied and desecrated by Jordan
for 19 years from 1948 to 1967.

When one backtracks through all these gestures, all the agreements promptly
violated by the Arab Muslims, all the prisoner releases - all we see are
failures. These failures cost hundreds of Israeli lives.

Regrettably, none of those Israeli leaders were indicted and tried for
engaging in everything from treason to perfidious judgement, which caused
the unleashing of dedicated enemies' forces to savage our own people.

I suspect that, if Israel was not currently being driven by ideological
Leftists who want desperately to de-Judaize themselves and their country -
who hate the Land given to the Jews in perpetuity by G-d - who hate their
own Jewishness, and who are also those who offer the Jewish people as
sacrifices - then Israel would be a normal country. These miscreants should
have been arrested, tried and convicted for crimes against the State and
crimes against humanity and their own people.

How is it that incompetent, corrupt men and women are allowed to use their
flawed judgement to make momentous decisions on the fate of their nation -
merely out of the thoughts within their own heads? No checks and balances
exist to save the Jewish people and the Jewish State. Why are these
mis-begotten leaders able to sacrifice their people? Why do we let them?
Such weak minds are targets of opportunity for American and European
Arabists searching for the weakest of our people.

Everyone, be they from the Right or the Left must understand that they and
their families would be slaughtered in a millisecond IF the Muslim states
are allowed to reach the Jewish population.

The Bush Administration's State Department shames decent Americans by
following a doctrine not unlike the years of World War II. Now this
shameless Administration, knowing the Muslim &quot;Jihadists&quot; (Holy Warriors for
Islam) cannot be appeased, have started the process of betraying a loyal
ally. Recruiting well-known Jewish Leftists who are eager to betray the
Jewish nation of Israel is not difficult. The pro-Arab State Department,
themselves anti-Israel and pro-Arab knew who to recruit in Israel who would
betray the Jewish nation.

As an American or an Israeli (not a politician) would you trust your lives
to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Iran and/or any in the Arab League? That is
what Bush, Rice and Baker want Israel to do.

These politicians have pressed Israel to release terrorists who have been
arrested at great personal peril to the Army and the Police. Â These
terrorists have been tried and convicted for crimes that endanger the
security and sovereignty of the Jewish people and the Jewish nation. 80% of
those convicted terrorists who have been released from jail have returned to
organizing and committing acts of violent terror. In fact, they consider
prison their Super Academy for learning how to deliver Terror to the
civilian people. They have proven themselves to their Terror Organizations
by attempting (and succeeding) to kill and maim Jews.

Bush, Rice and Baker find no embarrassment in becoming co-conspirators with
the goals of Hezb'Allah, Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, PFLP, Tanzim, Al Aksa
Martyrs' Brigades, etc. and all the Muslim and/or Arab nations who have
pledged to drive the Jews into the sea or to wipe them off the map.

Americans are a proud, honorable people - as are most in the American
Congress. Unfortunately, the greedy politicians emanating from the State
Department, hungry for oil and other resources, as well as the cash flow
that comes from doing business with the oil-rich Muslim countries, are NOT
representative of the American people.

Feeding the Snake is the mark of corrupt, amoral bureaucrats who have risen
high and are actually making and controlling America's foreign policy. They
disgrace the word &quot;American&quot;, the American people and the nation of America.
