&quot;No one will question your integrity if your integrity is not
questionable&quot; (Nathaniel Bronner).

President Umaru Yar'Adua is fast becoming a burden: a national burden
and a liability. Faster than anyone could spell his names, he is fast
becoming synonymous with sleaze, hypocrisy, and inertia. Poor
Yar'Adua, he couldn't even wait a year or so before taking a bath in a
cesspool. Abacha waited a while before unleashing cruelty and
criminality on the nation, and so did Babangida and Obasanjo -- but
not so with this president who seem to be in a hurry to engrave his
name in the book of ignominy.

Generals Abacha, Babangida, and Obasanjo waited and waited some more
before abridging and defacing decency and the rule of law. It took a
while before they let their proxies loose on the nation's
institutions. It was a while before they insulted the people's
sensibility. But not this president, not so with President Yar'Adua:
He is in a hurry. He is in a hurry to mess up an already bad
situation.

agreeable to corrupt practices than any of his predecessors. What a
shame! Oh what a shame! He seems to give cover and assistance to
illegality. He seems to surround himself with criminals and alleged
criminals.

Most of his political appointees are either criminally incompetent,
had a past full of skeletons, or members of dubious consortiums. What
manner of a president is this? What manner of a man do we have in Aso
Rock? It is as if he has no sense of history, no sense of time, no
sense of right or wrong. Obasanjo must have known the type of man he
was to appoint and force him on our political estate. Well, at this
rate and direction, he too shall end up in the waterloo, like his
anointer and master.

By way of his Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Nigerians are
being told to steal and steal and steal as much as they want. The
message Aondoakaa and Yar'Adua are sending is simple: (1) no matter
your offence, we will not come after you; (2) if a foreign court is
after you, we'll bail you out; and (3) never again shall the EFCC and
the ICPC have the audacity and the temerity to go after men like
Ibori, Orji Kalu, Odili, Ahmed Tinubu, Igbinedion, Dariye and others.
They are now protected: protected by Yar'Adua and Aondoakaa from
criminal prosecution.

Nobody -- not a low or high ranking civil servant, former and current
governors and their aides, ministers, commissioners or anyone else --
will ever be afraid of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
(EFCC) or the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences
Commission (ICPC) again. Never! Well, unless of course you are a petty
thief, a lowlife armed robber, or some bored and sick pickpocket.

James Ibori was a petty thief and a wayward ruffian before he became
the governor of his oil-rich state; but in eighth short years, he was
able to illegally amass an estimated $550 million. Yet, President
Yar'Adua and Mr. Michael Aondoakaa &quot;say he must not be probed or held
accountable&quot; for his financial crimes. And then there is Peter Odili
and Orji Kalu, perhaps third and fourth in line after Olusegun
Obasanjo and Abubakar Atiku when it comes to thievery. At this moment,
all are walking freely and celebrating -- thumbing their noses at
Nigeria.

Today, Yar'Adua (supposed guardian of the constitution) appears to be
the leading cheerleader for thieves. And Michael Aondoakaa (the chief
law enforcement officer) appears to beats their drums the loudest. Oh
what a shame! Don't the president and the attorney general understand
that they should be at the vanguard of probity, transparency, and
accountability? Their conduct and their position, stated and unstated,
are sickening and embarrassing.

If President Obasanjo was considered a monumental joke and failure,
President Yar'Adua is fast becoming a burden and a liability. His
liabilities seem limitless. This early and this quick, he is becoming
an embarrassment to the people and to the country. This early in his
presidency, he seems to be the buffer between thieves and the rule of
law. In all of this, there is a supposed Senior Advocate of Nigeria
(Michael Aondoakaa), who is aiding him. Both men seem to be aiding and
abetting a criminal syndicate that extends from the North to the South
through the East and the West.

In today's world, it is difficult being a Nigerian. Regrettably, both
the president and his attorney general make it much more difficult
being one.

Sabella,
You really must in a very small minority of people who believed that Yar'Adua would behave other than he is doing now.
Here was a man who agreed that he got the Presidency through one the greatest electoral frauds in the history of Africa.
Yet, he did not refuse to assume the new position offered him by an equally bent character called Obasanjo.
Here was a man[Yar' Adua] who was part and parcel of the band of people who subverted all the known provisions of Nigerian electoral, yet goes all over the world trumpetiing the inanity that Â his stolen presidency would operate by the rule of law.

Sabella, a thief would never catch a thief because they are patners in crime. Did you not know that Ibori and others were the actual financiers of this self-same stolen Presidency?
Nigeria is in for a great tragedy ahead.
