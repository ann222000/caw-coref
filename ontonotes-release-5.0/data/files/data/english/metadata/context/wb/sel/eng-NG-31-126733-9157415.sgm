Traditional Medicine Is
Defeated By Fibromyalgia
(A message from Dr. Rodger Murphree )
The American College of Rheumatology reports that the most common drugs used to treat fibromyalgia are no better than a sugar pill (worthless) within 3 months. And surveys show that fibromyalgia patients are no better off (symptoms the same or worse) after 15 years of taking doctor recommended prescription drug therapies.
But you already know this . Youve gone from one doctor to the next, taken drug after drug, and still dont feel any better. Or if you do, its fleeting, the symptoms return and now youre on another life-draining drug. The drugs used to treat fibromyalgia have side effects that are often worse than the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Ambien and Lunesta may cause short-term memory loss, brain fog (cant think straight), poor memory, anxiety, depression, flu-like pain, fatigue, poor immune function (susceptible to more infections), headaches, and more.
Trazadone, Elavil, Doxepin, Despramine, Imipramine, Pamelor, and Nortriptyline cause next day hang over, weight gain (ever wonder where all that extra weight came from?) muscle pains, and fatigue. They deplete the natural sleep hormone melatonin, thus creating a dependence on them for sleep. And unfortunately, they tend to lose their effectiveness after a period of time.
These drugs also deplete the all-important enzyme known as CoQ10
CoQ10 is responsible for 95% of the bodys energy!
Symptoms of low CoQ10 include fatigue, muscle aches, poor memory, brain fog, tingling in the hands and feet, anxiety, depression, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and headaches. Do you have any of these symptoms? Are you taking one of these medications?
Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, Restoril, Busbar, Tranxene, Serax, Librium, Tegretol, Valium, Trileptal, Seraquel, Risperdal, Symbax are usually used as anti-anxiety medication. These drugs are addictive (within 2 weeks), and patients build up a tolerance so that the drug eventually loses it effectiveness as an anti-anxiety or sleep aid.
Benzodiazepines have numerous side effects , including poor sleep, seizures, mania, depression, suicide, ringing in the ears, amnesia, dizziness, anxiety, disorientation, low blood pressure, nausea, fluid retention, sexual dysfunction (decreased desire and performance), weakness, somnolence (prolonged drowsiness or a trance-like condition that may continue for a number of days), headaches and tardive dyskinesia (tremors or shakes).
There is a better way to treat (and beat) fibromyalgia. You dont have to take dangerous life-draining drugs that mask the symptoms, yet dont even get you well.
Gabitril (tiagabine) Lyrica , and Neurontin (gabapentin) are anticonvulsant medications originally used to control seizures. They are now being used to block nerve-related pain (neuralgia) including pain caused by herpes zoster. These medications are also being prescribed for chronic headaches (with some success) and fibromyalgia (little success).
Side Effects:
There are several side effects associated with their use, including somnolence (prolonged drowsiness or a trance-like condition that may continue for a number of days), dizziness, weakness, fatigue, double vision, edema (fluid retention), ataxia (muscular in-coordination), thought disorder (suicidal or inappropriate thoughts), possible long-term ophthalmic problems (abnormal eyeball movements and disorders), tremors (uncontrollable tics or muscle twitches), weight gain, back pain, constipation, muscle aches, memory loss, asthenia (all over weakness), depression, abnormal thinking, itching, involuntary muscle twitching, serious rash, and runny nose.
Dont these side effects sound like the very same symptoms associated with fibromyalgia and CFS?
Forever Grateful - Lori Mitchell,Florence, AL.
When I was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia I heard many different things about treatment and doctors.The most common was that there really wasnt much that could be done for me except for taking pain medication and/or antidepressants to try to provide some relief from the pain. Everything else pointed to the same conclusion that I would have to accept feeling bad most of the time for the rest of my life.
At the age of 40 with a husband, a teenager, and a 7 year old, I could not accept that I would feel like this from now on.I began to search for more information and prayed for God to give me wisdom and direction in my search.Just as He always does, He led me to Dr. Murphrees book, as He answered my prayer.I had no idea when I began reading the book that Dr. Murphrees practice was just 1 1/2 hours away from where I live. I quickly made an appointment and found a practice full of kind, loving, caring people, all eager to see me feel better.
I explained to Dr. Murphree all of my symptoms, the worst being a terrible burning sensation that never went away in my arms and hands. I also described how, because of so much pain and so little energy, I really didnt care about anything anymore. It didnt matter to me if my family was fed, or if my kids had baths, or if their homework was done.I simply felt so bad that nothing mattered to me anymore.Dr. Murphree got me started on the Fibro/CFS Vitamins and 5HTP and I began to feel better in just a few days.
&quot;Within a few weeks I felt like a new person&quot;
From this point on I have always referred to Dr. Murphree as my Miracle Doctor. Finally, I had found someone who was treating the cause of my problem not just the symptoms.A sweeter, kinder, gentler, loving doctor could never be found.There are no words or ways to accurately express my or my familys gratitude for giving my life back to me.I am so grateful to God for leading me to such a wonderful person.
There are a number of important men in my life my husband, my son, and my father but the next most important man in my life after them is Dr. Murphree, my Miracle Doctor.
When was the last time
you really felt good?
If you continue down the path youre on, take the same drugs, supplements, eat the same diet, keep the same poor health habits, continue to suffer from poor sleep, no energy, chronic pain, and low moods, what will your life be like 5, 10, 20 years from now?
Life isnt supposed to be this way. Life is for living; playing with our children, ice skating with our grandchildren, having dinner with friends, having plenty of energy for going to work, shopping, cleaning the house, or doing any of the things we did before all these symptoms of fibromyalgia appeared. Is life passing you by while you struggle just to get through the day?
Are you sick and tired of
being sick and tired?
GOOD NEWS - YOU CAN STOP
FIBROMYALGIA IN ITS TRACKS
And you can do itwithout gobs and gobs of drugs, fad supplements, or multilevel-marketed, pseudoscience-driven, overly-hyped latest greatest cure all natural remedy. And, it doesnt have to involve visiting doctor after doctor who acts like youre crazy, lazy, or suffering from a Prozac deficiency.

I know exactly what youre going through
From Lou Ann Bryan, Elba, AL.
I have been suffering with Fibromyalgia for about 7 years; it actually took 2 years for me to be diagnosed. I saw several different doctors and they didn't offer much help except pills. If it wasn't a prescription, it was a lot of tests, everything always showed up negative. This was over a course of 5 years and I had almost given up.
I prayed to God to please give me answers and show me what to do. He did! I saw Dr. Murphree on WSFA &amp; knew that I had to see him. He was speaking in Auburn, AL. that night and I called my husband at work and told him about him and we went that night. His lecture made so much sense. I got a copy of his book &amp; called the next day for an appointment.
I had read approximately 10 books and Dr. Murphree's
book was the most helpful, there was no comparison .
It was very informative and I actually have purchased two to give to friends. I was on several different medications and wasn't getting any better; then I got on his clinical program and I know I would not have gotten better without his help. Within 2 weeks after seeing him, I knew I was on the right track to recovery.
I haven't felt this good in 10 years!
Dr. Murphree's guidance with the nutritional aspects was wonderful. His approach is so different from other doctors that I had seen; he has time for you, he takes your health problems seriously, I have gotten so much helpful advice from him and not a bunch of prescriptions. I know that the Lord sent me to Dr. Murphree and I thank Him everyday for Dr. Murphree.
I Specialize in Treating
and Beating Fibromyalgia
You see, unlike your family doctor, internist, even rheumatologist, who sees all sorts of patients (from high blood pressure to arthritis), I specialize in treating fibromyalgia patients day in and day out and have been doing so for the last eleven years.
Ive been in the trenches with fibromyalgia patients whove been everywhere (including John Hopkins and Mayo clinic) and have tried every drugand still dont feel good.
By the time most fibromyalgia patients come to see me theyre usually taking 12 different drugs. Yet within a few weeks of seeing me they often feel better than theyve felt in years. Within a few months they are often able to drastically reduce or eliminate most of their drugs.
I dont have all the answers , no one does.
And, my Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program may not be for you
I dont perform miracles and I dont guarantee that my Jump Start Program and Self-Help Patient Manual protocols will work for every fibromyalgia patient. But I do know that I HAVE helped thousands of fibromyalgia patients get well yes, get WELL. Not just cover up the symptoms but actually helped people get their life back.

The majority of fibromyalgia patients will steadily decline year after year, first losing their health, then their social life, sex life, job, zest for life, and finally any will to live.

UNFORTUNATELY , fibromyalgia patients arent the only ones who suffer .
Perhaps the most sinister aspect of the disease is that
family, friends, and co-workers all suffer as well .
They watch in despair and frustration as they lose their spouse, mother, father, grandparent, friend, and/or valued co-worker.

The Definition of Insanity
Benjamin Franklin said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
Isnt time to do something different? If youre ready to change what youre doing then please read on. You can beat fibromyalgia if youre willing to follow my advice.
WHY I DONT RECOMMEND DRUGS
Five years ago I owned a busy medical practice where I was the clinical director overseeing the care of hundreds of patients and managing a staff of 20including 5 medical doctors. The clinic was located on the campus of Brookwood Hospital here in Birmingham, Alabama.
We specialized in fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Patients came to us from all over North America. We were able to help many of these patients.
YOU NAME IT, WE TRIED IT
But I became discouraged with my large and ever-growing (and hence more complicated) integrative medical clinic. I believe that we began to lose sight of what was important: helping others help themselves get well. In the beginning we used a combination of traditional drugs and natural nutritional therapies.
As the clinic grew we had less and less time to spend with our patients. We began slipping into old bad habits of prescribing more and more drugs. We were looking for the Holy Grail, searching for the magic combination of drugs that would cure fibromyalgia.
The drug therapies often helped our patients feel better, but it was always temporary. By relying on drug therapy more and more, we had abandoned the original mission of the clinic, correcting the cause not covering up symptoms.
WE TRIED ALL THE DRUGS
Guaifenesin, HGH injections, chelation therapy, oxytocin, trigger point injections, Trazadone, Elavil, Effexor, Lexapro, Prozac, Flexeril, NSAIDs, Klonopin, Ambien, and Neurotin, even Oxycontin. Name a drug and we tried it. None of them worked long-term. And most created additional side effect-related symptoms that actually made our patients worse.
Our patients werent getting well. They became more and more dependant on drugs to help tone down their symptoms.
Using more and more drugs, of course, leads to further health problems
Taking Ativan for sleep or anxiety (over time) caused a CoQ10 deficiency which then causes chronic muscle pain, tingling in the hands and feet, fatigue, high blood pressure, and depression.
So the patient was then prescribed a drug for the leg pain (muscle relaxant), an amphetamine for fatigue (Ritalin, Concerta, etc.), an antidepressant, and Neurotin or Lyrica for the tingling in the hands and feet.
The Ritalin caused high blood pressure so a beta-blocker was prescribed.
Then Cymbalta was prescribed for the depression induced by the Beta-blocker.
This caused the patient to become more anxious so they were then prescribed a sedative, Klonopin or Xanax . The sedative caused the patient to have even more problems with fatigue, depression, and mental clarity. So then pain meds were prescribed
... a nd on it goes.
This isnt getting Well
(theres nothing healthy about this approach)
This is slow death by medicine
My Book Prompts Hundreds of
Support Groups to Call for Help
In 2003 I sold my medical practice, said good-bye to the doctors, nurses, and staff and wrote my first book, Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Harrison and Hampton Publishing 2003).
This book, now in its 3 rd edition (November 2006), hit a nerve with those suffering from fibromyalgia and quickly became a favorite reference guide for fibromyalgia support groups everywhere. After it was published, I found myself speaking to support groups around North America and, for the last two years, being featured in hundreds of radio interviews, TV interviews, and newspaper articles.
And, while I enjoy having my books in book stores, giving radio, newspaper, and TV interviews, I really enjoy helping fibromyalgia patients get WELL.
What Worked and Keeps Working
My doctors and I found that our patients who were receiving weekly vitamin/mineral IV treatments had less pain, more energy, slept better, reduced their anxiety and depression, had better mental clarity, and generally felt better all the way around. Of course getting weekly IV therapy was costly and inconvenient, not to mention often uncomfortable for our patients.
This inspired me to search for the right combination of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, enzymes, glandulars, and other nutrients essential for reversing the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
The Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package

Five years ago I perfected this protocol and the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package and Program were born.
By using a special combination of judicious (small amounts) of THE RIGHT DRUGS (yes, drugs can and are helpful but you must know which ones help and which ones make fibromyalgia worse, I reveal this in the Patients Self-Help Manual) diet changes and the right combination of the essential nutritional building blocks for restoring optimal brain function (neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine), endocrine function (adrenal, thyroid, and other hormones), gastrointestinal function (specific enzymes to stop bloating, gas, indigestion, and heartburn), metabolism (increase energy), and restore deep restorative sleep, my patients consistently BEAT Fibromyalgia.
Feel Free to call my clinic Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. CST, my staff will be glad to share how the Jump Start Program has led to success story after success story. 1-888-884-9577
From Sharon Gabriel, Navasota, Texas
I have Fibromyalgia/CFS/MPS and was absolutely miserable. I have been to twelve different doctors, tried so many different medications, all to no avail. Last July I saw your bookand ordered it.
I started on the CFS/Fibro Formula vitamins, digestive enzymes, Adrenals, &amp; 5HTP ( Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package ).
I feel so much better since I am off all prescription meds and taking your vitamins and supplements, I actually have a life again .
I can work in my yard, go shopping, on long rides, clean my own home, all of which caused me a great deal of pain before taking your products.
My husband, Jim, says it is so nice to havehis wife back, he is so happy I am not living in pain 24/7 and can do things with him again. I feel 85-90 percent better, and that is such a wonderful gift from you.
If I hadn't found your book, I know I would still be in a great deal of pain and miserable. Thank you so much for taking the time to research these illnesses and help produce these products and for being there any time I need to speak with you, even though I have never been to your office. You are a Godsend!
&quot;Bu t I cant just stop taking my drugs.&quot;
I dont recommend you do, at least not until you start feeling better on the protocols I recommend.
You dont have to stop taking your prescription drugs. In fact I recommend you dont stop taking your drugs until after youve been on the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program for several weeks. By then you should be sleeping through the night, feeling better, stronger, and then (with the help of your doctor) slowly (4-8 weeks) wean off one drug at a time.
Start with the ones that are not helping and are making you worse (See my books, I got into detail about which drugs I feel are helpful and which I feel are most likely making you feel worse).
You may need to stay on some drugs depending on your condition . And some drugs are actually helpful. In Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I discuss all the common and uncommon drugs and tell you which to avoid which ones work and which ones dont work. Dont stop your medications without reading this book or listening to my CD.
You can take any drug with
the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package.
No problem.
Why Do Doctors Continue to Push
Drugs When They Dont Work?
Its simpler, certainly quicker, to prescribe a drug to help someone fall asleep, than it is to educate him or her on how certain nutrients when low, keep you from going into deep sleep (replace the correct nutrients and you no longer have a problem with poor sleep).
Did you know that, in up to 40% of the time, anxiety and depression are caused by a genetic glitch that prevents you from properly using a certain B vitamin? And unfortunately, even if you take a B vitamins or a multivitamin formula, this special form of B vitamin is missing. Its in my CFS/Fibromyalgia Formula. I know how important this special form of B vitamin is.
Ive seen mood disorder patients whove tried every antidepressant imaginable with no luck, turn around overnight simply from taking this unique form of B vitamin.
There are certain biochemical pathways that must get the right combination and dose of essential vitamins and minerals or they just dont work. This leads to poor health, chronic tight muscles, poor sleep, anxiety, depression, and IBS.
Follow my advice and youll know more about fibromyalgia, and your body, than most doctors you visit each month.
I get patients who come to my clinic from all over the world. One of my patients traveled all the way from Iceland to see me! But, with these self-help books and CDs of mine, folks dont have to travel to Birmingham Alabama. Its all in a step-by-step, easy to understand and apply format.
Wouldnt it be nice to have some energy, lose that extra weight that just wont budge, and/or stop the hair loss?
Did you know that up to 40% of individuals with fibromyalgia suffer from low thyroid? This one reason why they cant lose weight, have IBS, anxiety, depression, fatigue, poor immune function, and brain fog. Im sure youve had a thyroid blood test and it came back normal.
Traditional thyroid tests are often worthless for detecting low thyroid.
Ill show you a much more accurate way to uncover low thyroid. And just as importantly, Ill show you how to boost your thyroid function and therefore, your energy, within weeks of starting a revolutionary nutritional supplement.
Eliminate your hair loss, fatigue, cold hands and feet, constipation, tingling in the hands and feet, anxiety, depression, weight gain (cant lose weight), brain fog, chronic sinus infections, and dry scaly skin.
I explain it all in chapter 15 of my book Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome .
My breakthrough nutritional/neutraceutical therapy is all about knowing how the bodys biochemistry works and applying just the right mix (and dose) of certain essential nutrients to make all the bodily systems (sleep/wake cycle, endocrine, GI, musculoskeletal, adrenal, brain, immune, etc.) operate at peak performance.
But more importantly, my specially designed
Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program works!
I give fibromyalgia seminars to
doctors throughout North America
PLEASE READ WHAT OTHER DOCTORS WHO USE MY
FIBROMYALGIA JUMP START PROGRAM HAVE TO SAY. Wendy Arthur, MD, and Ginger Campbell, MD
&quot;His holistic approach slowly transforms the mind, body, and spirit, restoring normal sleep, decreasing pain, and improving energy. Im seeing energy levels tripled and pain reduced to the point where prescription medicine can be discontinued. Dr. Murphrees program is grounded in his own clinical experience and passion for nutrition research. Most importantly, it works!
This is a book about medicine, not miracles, though sometimes Dr. Murphree seems to tap into a little of both. Treating and Beating is destined to inspire and educate millions of Americans and the physicians who care for and about them.&quot;
The Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program offers a safe, effective, and proven way to reverse the symptoms of fibromyalgia (and other diseases).
Did you know that the only thing to correct breakthrough depression is a natural nutrient available over the counter ? This particular amino acid has been shown to work to stop depressioneven when all the drug therapies fail.
It has also been shown to drastically reduce the pain and boost the energy of those with fibromyalgia. You can read more incredible natural medicine in the chapter on pain (Treating and Beating Chapter 16).
Ina Williams, Birmingham, AL.
I have suffered with fibromyalgia for approximately 5 years and have seen 3 doctors during that time that could never give me a diagnosis. I had taken several drugs and tried different therapies and nothing had helped until I saw Dr. Murphree.
Dr. Murphrees book has been most helpful in helping me with my illness and knowing what I should do next and Dr. Murphree is helpful in suggesting what to read. I would recommend Dr. Murphree's book, and him, to anyone.
Dr. Murphree gets to the bottom of the problem instead of loading you down with harmful drugs. There is a big lesson to be learned about Dr. Murphrees method in treating Fibromyalgia and CFS. The day that I entered Dr. Murphrees clinic was a changing day in my life. Not only did he help me tremendously with the pain in my legs and arms, but also with my bad menopause symptoms. In three weeks time I was pain free, my menopause symptoms were 90% gone.
&quot;I feel energetic, vital, happy, and most of all pain free.&quot;
Thank you so much Dr. Murphree, I would recommend you and your healing methods to my loved ones and dearest friends.
From Father Tim Bryant
Every night I ask God to bless Dr. Murphree in his important work. Because of him I am better able to do my important work... serving my God and my Country!
So many patients struggle year after year and finally give up. They dont think they can ever feel good again. So they complain day in and day out about how bad they feel. Pretty soon they no one wants to be around them. How sad, because I find most people can BEAT fibromyalgia.
There are only 5 prescription drugs that help you go into deep restorative sleep. The rest of the sleep drugs actually make you worse, depleting your natural sleep hormone and leads to numerous side effects . I reveal more about this in my two-fibro books. Even better, since no one suffers from a sleep drug deficiency, Ill show you how to use the natural nutrients that are responsible for deep restorative sleep.
Chapter 6 reveals my all-natural, mood-boosting, pain relieving, IBS reversing (IBS GONE IN 2 WEEKS OR LESS), protocol that promotes deep restorative sleep each and every night. My patients and readers using my protocols are often sleeping through the night 4-5 days after starting the fibromyalgia symptom-busting nutrients contained in the Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package.
Do you suffer with bloating, gas, indigestion, or reflux? Do you go back and forth from having diarrhea to constipation ?
Traditional medicine treats these symptoms with Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, Zelnorm (now linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke), which of course have side effects. These side effects include depression, fatigue, and muscle pain.
I describe a quick, safe, and easy solution to stopping gas, bloating, indigestion, and reflux that works in a matter of days. Read about this slam-dunk remedy in chapter 13.
This special neutraceutical is also contained in the Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package.
Are you suffering with low moods,
anxiety, and/or depression ?
In chapter 17 of Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , I provide a step-by step approach, using specific all natural amino acids, to allow you to beat anxiety and or depression once and for all. Of course I made sure my Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package contains these all-important amino acids.
There are 2 important nutrients that have been shown to drastically reduce the chronic muscle aches and pains associated with fibromyalgia. Unfortunately, I find that up to 90% of my fibro patients are deficient in these two all-important nutrientseven in those taking nutritional supplements. By just adding these two nutrients, at the right dose, patients usually find that their chronic achy pain IS DRASTICALLY REDUCED or disappears altogether. I find these nutrients to be invaluable for those with fibromyalgia pain. This is why I made sure to also put these super nutrients in Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package.
By using these potentially life-changing nutrients , patients are often able to cut their prescription drugs in half . Read all about these important essential nutrients in my Fibromyalgia Patient Self-Help Manual. If youre taking the Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package youll be getting these key amino acids.

My Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (3 rd edition) provides the step-by-step guide for using the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program. Sharon Douglas
Id say, along with the adrenal supplements, the CFS/FMS Formula (contained in Fibromyalgia Super Jump Start Package ) has made the biggest difference in how well I feel. If I miss a few days of either supplement I start to feel sluggish and run down.
Ive taken dozens of different supplements over the last few years, but none have seemed to help like the ones Dr. Murphree recommended. I like the convenience of taking a pack in the morning and one in the afternoon. I used to have to carry pills around in my pockets or purse. It was expensive, confusing and hard to take so many pills each day. Usually I lost interest and simply gave up until another sure cure supplement came along.
Pam Harper, Bossier City, LA.
This is concerning my sister, Eva Blakeley, she was diagnosed over a year ago with Fibromyalgia. I thank God every day for sending Dr. Murphree to our city. He was a Godsend. Eva was very doubtful, but she bought the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package . Now you have to understand, my sister was in pretty bad shape. She was down for days, no sleep, in so much pain. But after the first day on the jump start pack, I had my sister back, she was ready to die she hurt so bad, now it's been almost 2 weeks and she is stronger every day. I truly thank God, and Dr. Murphree. She is telling everyone she sees about this wonderful miracle.
Thank you again.
Ive taken vitamins and supplements
and they didnt help.
I understand. But, please know that taking a handful of supplements that you read about in a magazine, or that were recommended to you by your local health store clerk, isnt going to get it. Fibromyalgia is far too complicated for a half-hazard arrangement of B-vitamins, vitamin-C, a One A-Day multivitamin, some MSM, malic acid, or flax seed pills. Your illness isnt going anywhere with this combination.
Nor is the latest greatest supplement OF THE MOMENT going to do the job, Coral Calcium, Noni Juice, Mangosteen Juice, Juice Plus, or Seaweed extract isn't going to do much but lighten your wallet.
Look, fibromyalgia is a tough nut to crack. It takes a sophisticated, well thought out, tried-and-true approach based on clinical research and real life success stories; not a bunch of fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants recommendations.
I take a One-A-Day, or Centrum Silver , why do I need to take your multivitamin (CFS/Fibromyalgia Formula)?
This formula is based on the RDA or Recommended Disease Allowance. Just enough vitamins to keep you from getting Scurvy or Beriberi. The RDA is some 60 years behind the scientific nutritional research. Taking these One-A-Day multivitamin formulas is like communicating with The Pony Express. It may work, but not very effectively. Id rather use email. Using RDA is like throwing a grain of sand into the Sahara Desert. It isnt going to amount to much. And with all the additives and inferior by products contained in these mass marketed multivitamins, youre lucky if you absorb any of the minute nutrients it contains. Most of these tablet wind up undigested and in the toilet.
Youd have to take up to 20 Centrum Silvers tablets to equal one pack of my CFS/FMS formula which is based on Optimal Daily Allowance!

I cant take pills, they get caught in my throat.
I understand. But no problem. Simply call my office 1-888-884-9577 and Ill custom design a Jump Start Package with powdered or liquid vitamins and minerals. Its not as effective and it may take longer for you to see the life restoring benefits of the regular CFS/Fibromyalgia Jump Start Package, but it will work.
Call 1-888-884-9577 Mon-Fri 8-4pm CST.
Im taking medicine for my high blood pressure (heart, thyroid, moods, headaches, etc.) and cant stop taking it or I feel terrible.
No problem, keep taking it. The majority of my fibromyalgia patients are taking at least 6 prescription drugs when they begin working with me. I specifically designed my Jump Start Package so that you could take it with any and all prescription medications. I hate taking pills. I understand. I have a lot of folks who feel just like you do. But at some point theyve become fed up with always being sick and tired and theyre willing to do what it takes to get their life back. If youre at that point then take the next step and avoid another year feeling like death warmed over.
Id like to run this by my doctor.
Fine. Go ahead and ask your doctor about this program, He or she will just laugh and tell you to keep taking your life-draining drugs. Please forgive me I dont mean too be rude but why would you continue to see the same doctor(s) who arent helping you? Most traditional doctors think you are lazy, crazy, or just need another drug.
My doctor says that nutritional supplements dont work.
FIRE YOUR DOCTOR and find one who reads the medical literature. There are THOUSANDS of scientifically validated studies showing that certain vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals reduce, and at times reverse, the symptoms of fibromyalgia. People tend to be down on what they are not up on. A medical Doctors training contains very very little, if any, training about orthomolecular medicine or the use of nutritional supplements to cure illnesses.
Why doesnt my doctor know about this stuff.?
Well quite frankly because they arent really interested. They only know what the drug reps tell them (or spoon feeds them rather.) They dont have the time, or make the time, to study dozens of peer reviewed medical and nutritional journals each month like I do. They havent traveled throughout North America year after year learning from the best nutritional-oriented doctors and scientists. They have a herd mentality. They dont want to rock the boat and go against what all the other doctors are doing using drugs that the pharmaceutical reps advise them to use.
They havent taken thousands of post-graduate hours in clinical nutrition as I have. They just dont know anything about nutritional medicine and they arent going to make the time to learn it. Its that simple.
I dont like doing things on my own. Are you available for consults?
My staff is available to answer questions Mon-Fri 8-4pm CST. Im available for in-office or phone consultations. It usually takes 4-6 weeks to get an appointment with me. However. I had to reschedule some of my doctors-only seminars I was to give later this year. This has allowed me to free up several unexpected days for phone or in office consults. I typically charge $340 an hour. However, to help you feel more comfortable about getting started (for those who want to do this) Ive asked my staff to block out several half-hour new patient consults and Ive told then to keep the price at $165. This may change so sorry if you call and this is no longer accurate. But for now, its $165 for the first visit.
I cant afford $165 for the the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Progam.
I understand. One hundred and sixty five dollars is a lot of money. But in the grand scheme of things its worth millions. What is your health worth? What would you pay to be able to play with your children, travel to see your grandkids without arriving totally exhausted, to be able to cook dinner for your family again, to go back to work, to have a social life again? I find that those who really want to get well will find away to afford the program. But Im sensitive to costs as well. This is why Ive discounted the Jump Start Program by $80.
How long before Ill see a difference from taking the Jump Start Package?
Provided you follow my easy-to-understand and implement directions, you should notice moderate to significant improvement within 2-4 weeks of starting the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program. Individuals who are in really bad shape will find that it may take 4-8 weeks before they really feel better. But if theyll hang in there and follow my step-by-step program, theyll usually enjoy life-changing benefits within 4-8 weeks.
This program beats any other drug, supplement, or hands-on therapy for fibromyalgia.
How long do I have to take the Jump Start Package?
Depending on the person and degree of their illness, my patients typically will take the Jump Start Package for minimum of 4-6 months. I recommend you stay on a good optimal daily allowance (ODA) multivitamin/mineral formula for the rest of your life. You can stop fibromyalgia, but if you get run down again, it will quickly raise its ugly head.
How much does it cost each month?
Some can take half the dose ($61) a month and others will need to take the full dose ($122) per month.
And for most folks theyll need to add, at least temporarily, other nutraceuticals to correct specific conditions; if needed, probiotics for yeast or stubborn IBS, natural remedies for breakthrough pain, etc. Click Here to Start The Program Get Started on the Fibromyalgia Jump Start Program.
