I had my front end smashed the other day and am looking for a good
shop to replace the front nose in MarinCounty.  I found the
replacement parts at busdepot.com.  Just trying to figure out the
labor aspect of it.  Looks like cutiing the old out and welding in the
new.  I am looking to out source to a good VW body shop.  Does anyone
have any thoughts?
thanks,
Tom
