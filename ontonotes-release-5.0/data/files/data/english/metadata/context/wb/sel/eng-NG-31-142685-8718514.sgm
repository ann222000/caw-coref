In Elk v. Wilkins, the Supreme Court got it right.  It
ruled that John Elk, an Indian, was not a citizen,
because he was not born &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot;
of the United States, in the meaning intended by the
authors of the amendment; they ruled this way, despite
the clear fact that Elk was born in the United States
and was subject to its laws.

From the decision:

The question then is, whether an Indian, born a member
of one of the Indian tribes within the United States,
is, merely by reason of his birth within the United
States, and of his afterwards voluntarily separating
himself from his tribe and taking up his residence
among white citizens, a citizen of the United States,
within the meaning of the first section of the
fourteenth amendment of the constitution.

...

The main object of the opening sentence of the
fourteenth amendment was to settle the question, upon
which there had been a difference of opinion throughout
the country and in this court, as to the citizenship of
free negroes, (Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393;) and to
put it beyond doubt that all persons, white or black,
and whether formerly slaves or not, born or naturalized
in the United States, and owing no allegiance to any
alien power, should be citizens of the United States
and of the state in which they reside. Slaughter-House
Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 73; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100
U. S. 303, 306.

This section contemplates two sources of citizenship,
and two sources only: birth and naturalization. The
persons declared to be citizens are 'all persons born
or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof.' ***The evident meaning of these
last words is, not merely subject in some respect or
degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but
completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and
owing them direct and immediate allegiance.***
[emphasis added]  And the words relate to the time of
birth in the one case, as they do to the time of
naturalization in the other. Persons not thus subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of
birth cannot become so afterwards, except by being
naturalized, either individually, as by proceedings
under the naturalization acts; or collectively, as by
the force of a treaty by which foreign territory is
acquired. Indians born within the territorial limits of
the United States, members of, and owing immediate
allegiance to, one of the Indiana tribes, (an alien
though dependent power,) although in a geographical
sense born in the United States, are no more 'born in
the United States and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof,' within the meaning of the first section of
the fourteenth amendment, than the children of subjects
of any foreign government born within the domain of
that government, or the children born within the United
States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of
foreign nations.

It is also worthy of remark that the language used,
about the same time, by the very congress which framed
the fourteenth amendment, in the first section of the
civil rights act of April 9, 1866, declaring who shall
be citizens of the United States, is 'all persons born
in the United States, and not subject to any foreign
power, excluding Indians not taxed.' 14 St. 27; Rev.
St. § 1992. Such Indians, then, not being citizens by
birth, can only become citizens in the second way
mentioned in the fourteenth amendment, by being
'naturalized in the United States,' by or under some
treaty or statute.

No torture of the word &quot;jurisdiction&quot; can make it mean
what the pro-illegal-immigrant gangsters want it to
mean.  The U.S.-born offspring of aliens, particularly
illegal aliens, cannot logically be considered
citizens.  *NO* U.S.-born offspring of any sort of
alien can logically be considered to be citizens, based
on the clearly understood meaning of &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in
the citizenship, viz., &quot;completely subject to their
political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and
immediate allegiance.&quot;  The U.S.-born offspring of
aliens owe their allegiance to wherever their parents
owe allegiance.  There is no &quot;swearing&quot; or oath-taking
involved.  The parents owe their allegiance to foreign
countries and governments, and necessarily so do their
U.S.-born offspring.

You dumbshit,

it says &quot;All PERSONS&quot; in the language,
not &quot;all SLAVES&quot;.

PLYER v DOE (1982) settled the issue:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe

The court's reasoning was significant because it ruled that illegal
immigrants residing in a state are &quot;within the jurisdiction&quot; of that
state. This implies that the U.S.-born children of such immigrants are
&quot;subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]&quot;, and therefore
qualify for birthright citizenship under the first clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. This implication is made explicit in a footnote
that states:

&quot;no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment
&quot;jurisdiction&quot; can be drawn between resident aliens whose entry into
the United States was lawful, and resident aliens whose entry was
unlawful&quot;

Justice Gray concluded that &quot;[e]very citizen or subject of another
country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the
protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the
United States.&quot;

When the United States government has to notify the Mexican consulate

AMENDMENT XIV

Passed by Congress June 13, 1866.  Ratified July 9, 1868

Section 1.

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; nor to deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
---

You claim that illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdictions
in which they live.  If they are caught stealing a car, are they not
arrested by local police?  If you answer this question just once, then
they are subject to the jurisdiction wherein they live.   Then if the
person is subject to the jurisdiction, then their offspring are as well.

The case of the native peoples is different as they were not subject to
United States laws, or laws of state or local jurisdictions.  By taking
up residence on the reservation, tribal members were adjudicated
according to the laws of the tribe and that of the reservation.  This
despite the fact that they lived within the confines of the United State
borders but not on United States soil.  This is similar to the Russian
embassy.  While within the confines of the United States, it is
considered Russian Soil and subject to the laws of Russia and not the
United States.

While the parents may hold allegiance to a foreign government that does
not necessarily mean the child will as well.  Citizenship is not
guaranteed either, the U.S. born child of an immigrant must declare
citizenship.  This can be done anytime after the child reaches the age
of 16 years.

My family is from Canada.  My brother married a U.S. citizen and had
children.  At some point in their lives, my niece and nephew were
required to choose their allegiances.  One chose to live in Canada and
the other chose to live in Arizona both citizens of their respective
countries.

While many of my siblings chose to return to Canada, I chose to stay
here in the states.  I was naturalized and I vote.

This was a case involving the North American Indian tribes and may not
necessarily apply to &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. Its pretty much given that the
SCotUS has not rendered a decision with regards to that hot button issue.

However, the term illegal is clearly defined. In as much as it is defined,
that means those peoples here illegally are, in fact, in an ongoing
commission of a crime and should be treated as such without regard to their
national origins.

Now, if they claim refugee status for whatever reason, then a whole
different set of rules comes into play.

Now, given all the hoopla, it is clear that illegal immigrants are here
illegally and should not be offered the rights as conferred to CITIZENS.

Until the matter if settled with the SCotUS, its going to remain a problem.

p. I had to trim some groups here as a result of my ISP's draconian
policies. sorry about that.

Timothy is hardly a 'American-hater.&quot; Conversely, however, here are
some of your posts.

&quot;The Marine Corps produces psychopath killers.&quot;

&quot;They (Marines) came back (boot camp) as completely alienated from
their fellow citizens. They want to murder their fellow citizens.&quot;

&quot;Most people don't want to murder fat people. Soldiers and marines
(sic) do.&quot;

[Marines] &quot;deliberately trained to loathe his fellow citizens. It's
extremely disturbing.&quot;

Seems to me Rudy is the anti-American.

Rudy, formerly known as Leif Eriksen, is a known hateful Usenet
