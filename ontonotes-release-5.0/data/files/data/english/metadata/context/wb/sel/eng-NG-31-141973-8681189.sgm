Speaking of Bush hiding from the draft in Alabama, he recently said
that he wished he could join the fighting men in Iraq but he's too
old.  That's some funny bushit.  He had his chance to fight in the
vietnam war but he piloted barstools in Alabama instead.  ...and
didn't even finish that!

This farce won't go to trial, for one reason: discovery. We'll finally
find out about Mapes' efforts to find the real killer -- oh, sorry,
that's a different farce -- we'll find out the truth about Mapes'
sources and what Rather knew, and when he claims he didn't

They should go over the whole 60 minutes II report and determine which
parts are backed up and which aren't.  Killian's own secretary said
that the substance of the memo was correct.

The bottom line is that Bush's dad pulled strings to get young George
out of Vietnam and into TANG and that Georgie didn't seem to complete
his service in the reserve while piloting a bar stool in Alabama.

Dan Rather was always the Republicans poster boy as a media liberal.
It's not too surprising that he was set up by CBS managment which has
turned to the right since Westinghouse sold out their entire
manufacturing conglomerate to buy the network. I want to see this go to
trial.  A public trial will answer the long standing question as to who
created the false documents on AWOL George and for what reasons.  Who
all was behind this?  So far it's been swept under the rug.

Here are a couple of eyewitnesses that claim the Bush never showed up:

Quoting from:

MEMPHIS - Two members of the Air National Guard unit that President
George W. Bush allegedly served with as a young Guard flyer in 1972 had
been told to expect him and were on the lookout for him. He never
showed, however; of that both Bob Mintz and Paul Bishop are certain.

And here's one who contradicts them:

http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-13-bush-military_x.htm

A retired Alabama Air National Guard officer said Friday that he
remembers George Bush showing up for duty in Alabama in 1972,
reading safety magazines and flight manuals in an office as he
performed his weekend obligations.

&quot;I saw him each drill period,&quot; retired Lt. Col. John &quot;Bill&quot;
Calhoun said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
from Daytona Beach, Fla., where he is preparing to watch this
weekend's big NASCAR race.

&quot;He was very aggressive about doing his duty there. He never
complained about it. ... He was very dedicated to what he was
doing in the Guard. He showed up on time and he left at the end of
the day.&quot;

Getting back to the topic, I will leave you with this thought
to console you:  If Dan Rather's lawsuit proceeds - and there
is a good chance of this, given the hard feelings on both

Har-dee-har-har.... Ho ho ho....

&quot;The biggest political joke in America is that we have a liberal press.
It's a joke taken seriously by a surprisingly large number of people...
The myth of the liberal press has served as a political weapon for
conservative and right-wing forces eager to discourage critical coverage
of government and corporate power ... Americans now have the worst
of both worlds: a press that, at best, parrots the pronouncements of the
powerful and, at worst, encourages people to be stupid with pseudo-news
that illuminates nothing but the bottom line.&quot;

The issue is... that the documents existed up until the Shrub was innaugurated.
Practically the whole world knew that America was installing a drunken, ex-coke
head, draft-dodging, AWOL, fortunate son with a criminal record as President.

Copies of the documents incriminating him for deserting his position in the
Air National Guard and for failing to appear for his physicals and refusing to
take drug tests,were all over the web until recently.  They can still be found
in some places... but of course, they're just &quot;copies&quot; of something, and thus
mean essentially nothing when the entire US government is sworn to protect
you.

All records of Boy George's tenure as governor of Texas are now in his father's
presidential library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC
investigations into Junior's insider trading and bankrupt companies are sealed
in secrecy and unavailable for public view.  His military records have all been
either destroyed or altered to reflect no wrong-doing.

It's amazing what one can hide (or accomplish) when the entire resources
of the CIA, FBI, and Secret Service are sworn to cater to your every whim.

Well, if it isn't Herr Ernst...

There was nothing *obviously* fake about the documents, no matter what
the media said about type styles and typewriters.  The fact of the matter is
that the federal government (under Bush) simply denied the document that
Rather managed to get his hands on and claimed, &quot;fakery&quot;.

Since all of the Shrub's criminal history, military history, actions as governor
of Texas, and most of what he has done as president have been classified
and locked away in well protected vaults... who can prove otherwise. (?)

Bush is a brain-dead, below &quot;C&quot; average moron who was accepted into

Setting someone up is the name of the game these days... ask Valerie
Plame and her husband.

&quot;This country is in the grip of a President who was not elected, who has
surrounded himself with thugs in suits who care nothing about human life
abroad or here, who care nothing about freedom abroad or here, who care
nothing about what happens to the earth... The so-called war on terrorism
is not only a war on innocent people in other countries, but it is also a war
on the people of the United States: a war on our liberties, a war on our
standard of living. The wealth of the country is being stolen from the people
and handed over to the super-rich. The lives of our young are being stolen.
And the thieves are in the White House.&quot;

&quot;The biggest political joke in America is that we have a liberal press.
It's a joke taken seriously by a surprisingly large number of people...
The myth of the liberal press has served as a political weapon for
conservative and right-wing forces eager to discourage critical coverage
of government and corporate power ... Americans now have the worst
of both worlds: a press that, at best, parrots the pronouncements of the
powerful and, at worst, encourages people to be stupid with pseudo-news
that illuminates nothing but the bottom line.&quot;
-- Mark Hertzgaard

&quot;America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and
disinformed by their government. This is tragic but our media
is -- I wouldn't even say corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us
anything that the government doesn't want us to know.&quot;
-Gore Vidal

&quot;A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the
facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their
media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality
contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and
deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get.&quot;

The content WAS valid....  did you ever hear anyone argue that it wasn't?

NO.......    They argued that the version which Rather had in his possession
wasn't an &quot;official&quot; document, period, end of story. The rest of Boy George's
defense was merely in the minds of the gullible couch-potatoes who bought
the news media 'spin' and then went to work and put their own 'spin' on things
at the water cooler and in the bars.

Rather *could* have gone to press with the real deal.... but the spin-machine
of the entire US Government was pulling more weight than Rather could. We
will likely never know the truth on this one.

&quot;No form of government, once in power, can be trusted to limit
its own ambition, to extend freedom and to wither away. This
means that it is up to the citizenry, those outside of power, to
engage in permanent combat with the state, short of violent,
escalatory revolution, but beyond the gentility of the ballot-box,
to insure justice, freedom and well being.&quot;

-- Howard Zinn

&quot;Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean
to stand by the president or any other public official, save
exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country.
It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the
country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent
that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by
the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth,
whether about the president or anyone else&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; George W. Bush himself can't remember what he did for his country in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1972.  Nor has any member of the Alabama National Guard been found who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remembers serving with George.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of being ignorant of the burden of proof, would you care to

&gt; &gt; &quot;I can't remember what I did, but I wasnt flying because they dont have
&gt; &gt; the same airplanes.&quot; - George W. Bush, June 2000

&gt; &gt; &gt; You may wish to reconsider this claim,
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly if Dan Rather is your source.

&gt; &gt; Here are a couple of eyewitnesses that claim the Bush never showed up:

&gt; And here's one who contradicts them:

&gt; http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-13-bush-military_x.htm

&gt; A retired Alabama Air National Guard officer said Friday that he
&gt; remembers George Bush showing up for duty in Alabama in 1972,
&gt; reading safety magazines and flight manuals in an office as he
&gt; performed his weekend obligations.

&gt; &quot;I saw him each drill period,&quot; retired Lt. Col. John &quot;Bill&quot;
&gt; Calhoun said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
&gt; from Daytona Beach, Fla., where he is preparing to watch this
&gt; weekend's big NASCAR race.

&gt; &quot;He was very aggressive about doing his duty there. He never
&gt; complained about it. ... He was very dedicated to what he was
&gt; doing in the Guard. He showed up on time and he left at the end of
&gt; the day.&quot;
">

Quoting the Washington Post, February 15, 2004, page A01:

&quot;Only one person has vivid recollections of serving with Bush at
Dannelly field. John B. &quot;Bill&quot; Calhoun, 69 -- whose name was provided by
a Republican ally of Bush's -- said he saw Bush sign in at the 187th
eight to 10 times for about eight hours each from May to October 1972.
But Calhoun remembers seeing Bush at Dannelly at times in mid-1972 when
the White House acknowledges Bush was not pulling Guard duty in Alabama
yet; his first drills were in October, according to the White House.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan on Friday was at a loss to
reconcile the discrepancy.&quot;

If it was a &quot;Republican dirty trickster&quot;, the trickster would have to
operate on the assumption that Mapes and Rather were complete, utter

Anyone who's done papers or assignments for length has enough
experience fudging leading, fonts, and letterspacing to know a 1972
typewriter isn't going to exactly match the default settings and
default font of Word. You can't do that on another word processor or
desktop publishing system with default settings, and can't do it
period with a typewriter. Even within the same named &quot;font&quot; different
type foundries have different letterspacing, kerning, and other
details that would make impossible an exact match.

As an Adobe font expert put it:

----
The typography of the Killian documents can be matched with a modern
personal computer and printer using Microsoft Word with the default
font (Times New Roman) and other settings. Therefore the equipment
with which the Killian documents were actually produced must have been
capable of matching the typographical characteristics produced by this
modern technology.

The letterspacing of the Times New Roman font used by Microsoft Word
with a modern personal computer and printer employs a system of 18
units relative to the letter height (em), with common characters being
5 to 17 units wide. (The technology allows even finer variability of
character widths, but the 18 unit system was chosen for compatibility
with the Linotype phototypesetting and earlier hot-metal versions of
the font.) In contrast, the variability of character widths available
on early 1970s typewriters using proportional letterspacing was more
limited, due to the mechanical technology employed. The most
sophisticated of these machines, the IBM Selectric Composer, used a
system of 9 units relative to the letter height, in which all
characters were 3 to 9 units wide. Less complex machines used fewer
widths.

Differences in individual character widths accumulate over the length
of a line, so that comparatively small differences become readily
apparent. Because of the differing character widths employed, the
letterspacing exhibited by the Killian documents (matching that
produced by a modern computer and printer) could not have been
produced with a mechanical typewriter using proportional letterspacing
in the early 1970s. At the time the documents were purportedly
created, the matching letterspacing could only have been produced
using phototypesetting or hot-metal printing. But it is not a
realistic possibility that Killian would have had these documents
printed, so it must be concluded that they are modern forgeries.

But the offer is still open--pick the typewriter of your choice,
exactly match the documents, and collect $50K. Go for it.

None of his examples come  close to matching the documents. Which is
why the CBS document examiner concluded the documents were fake.

There's a $50K reward for anyone who matches the documents using 1972
typewriters. Nobody's collected.

You can do the same thing on a copy of Word. Open a document and start
typing. Same line breaks. Same superscripted th, but only if you don't
put a space after the 187. Same tab settings.

Do it in another word processor and you don't get the same results.

As the CBS expert put it:

&quot;Tytell concluded, for the reasons described below, that (i) the
relevant portion of the Superscript Exemplar was produced on an
Olympia manual typewriter, (ii) the Killian documents were not
produced on an Olympia manual typewriter, and (iii) the Killian
documents were produced on a computer in Times New Roman typestyle . &quot;

Captain Ed provides a reality check:

And typography was the least of the issues with the memos. The
signatures of Jerry Killian turned out to be forged, for one
thing, not unexpected when Burkett created them out of thin air.
The format of the memos didn't match the Air Force standards in
place at the time. They referenced military standards that didn't
exist. They demanded that Bush take a physical exam well before
his requirement date. The story they reported was that a general
pressured Bush's commander to deep-six his concerns, when the
general with supposed Bush connections had retired eighteen months
before these memos were written. And so on, and so on.

Of course, all of this and more came out in the internal CBS
investigation. It revealed Mapes as an out-of-control partisan who
willfully ignored warnings about the memos in her rush to air
already-discredited allegations against a presidential candidate
eight weeks before an election. These are all of the facts that
Mapes ignored in her Huffington Post essay, just as she ignored
and hid facts before the broadcast that ended her career at CBS.

Bully boys of the Internet? We asked tough questions and did our
own fact-checking. In times past, that's what investigative
journalists used to do, before some of them decided to use their
power in the media to become hacks and smear artists. Mapes,
Rather, and their ilk (fortunately a minority in the profession)
cannot abide having Truth spoken to their Power, having to account
for their corruption. Three years later, Mapes still thinks she's
above accountability.

Funny thing is that the Auguest 1, 1972 memo includes terms such as
&quot;1st&quot;.  Microsoft Word will superscript the &quot;st&quot; unless it is proceeded
by a space.  In the memo there is no space.

In the same document we find a superscripted &quot;th&quot;.  Word has a control
to turn off superscripting, but would have turned it off for the entire
document.

Did Tytell examine the possibility that the documents were printed on a

You can easily duplicate the other memos with Word--change a few
margins, add a couple spaces at the end of a line. You can't duplicate
them with a typewriter or anything else from 1972 other than a high-
end typesetting machine, and perhaps not even then.

Go ahead. Try.
