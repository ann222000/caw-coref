Subject: Dog Report

Well, today was Fidget's day at the vet.  He was eating fine for a
while, then stopped again.  We still don't know what's going on with
him, so we took in to the vet.  Also, David was afraid he'd
accidentally
given Fidget a chicken bone while feeding him some chicken when he
wouldn't eat dog food--he'd pulled it out of the chicken, but then
couldn't find it.  Luckily, an X-ray showed that that is not the case.

But it *did* show that he had a mass of fecal material in his
intestines, which was odd because he hadn't had a bowel movement in a
couple of days, except for a little bit last night (another reason for
taking him in).  So they gave him an enema to get that out.  He seems
to
be feeling much better now, at any rate.

While I was waiting for him to be X-rayed and then later for him to
have
the enema (I was at the vet's a *long* time), I was chatting with
people
in the waiting room.  One man was there with a very sweet mixed-breed
dog that he said his daughter had rescued from the streets of Puerto
Rico, when her husband was working down there.  She had already rescued

three and her husband said no more, so she went through all the hoops
to
send this one up to her parents.  I commented on what a lucky dog this
was, and he said "Oh, she's had a good life since she got here!"

I talked to another couple for a while about dogs in general--never did

find out what theirs was up there for, a large furry black dog (short
fur) with a *lot* of energy.  There was also a dachshund (one of the
few
dog breeds I recognize on sight), two tall skinny dogs (not greyhounds,

but sort of similar), one black and white and the other gray, and some
others.  None of them were real thrilled about being at the eeevil
clinic, but they all had interesting personalities.  I just love
watching dogs, and watching dogs interact with their people, because
they're all different but they're also all the same in many ways.

Toby is doing fine, at the moment--he's eating well (it takes a bit to
get him started--basically we have to hover in such a way that he
thinks
we're coming to get his food, which "jump starts" him into eating
it--then he'll finish the bowl, usually) and is very happy most of the
time.  However, it's sinking in that he won't be with me forever.  I
get
very depressed if I think about that for very long, and it's impossible

*not* to think about it.

He's gotten to where he'll sit in my lap while I'm at the computer, and

actually let me type, as long as he gets frequent pets and skritches
(although he's not in my lap at the moment, he's lying on the floor
next
to my chair).

God, I love this little dog, aggression issues and all.

Subject: A storm, and a dog

Washington is having a tremendous lightning storm as I write this,
incredibly bright and rapid strokes of lightning all around, really
loud rolls of thunder.  From the 11th floor of the tallest building in
the area, the view is spectacular, and a little frightening.  The
entire metropolitan area is under a tornado watch, which is more than a

little frightening.

And my dog is all by himself at the hospital.

In &lt; http://www.soc-motss.org/doc/m­ otss_posts_fidget.html&gt;, I posted
about acquiring Fidget, a black-haired cockapoo who just seems to love
everybody, and whom everybody who likes dogs at all seems to like.  I
have also posted in the past about what we went through with the dog
before that, who had a heart condition.  Our hope was to end up with a
basically healthy dog.

Well, so far we haven't managed that.  Our other dog, Toby, (who never
got his own posting--sort of like the second child's baby book being
empty) is on Prozac and another antipsychotic, to the tune of
$100/month.  Fidget has allergies, though we don't know to what,
exactly, just that he reacts to something in the spring and the fall if

we don't have him on an antihistamine (generic Chlortrimetron,
thankfully, at $7/month).  And because he's missing so much of his
intestine, he gets bouts of diarrhea from time to time.

But this past month has been worse.  Fidget is the kind of dog who
loves to eat.  (Some of you are asking "Is there any other kind?" but
yes, there is--Toby.)  Recently he stopped eating unless we coaxed him.

This raised a red flag in both David and me, and we took him to the
vet.  He turned out to have a raging bladder infection, so the vet put
him on antibiotics and he perked up a little.

A week later, he was acting strange again, and not eating.  So again we

took him to the vet.  We were worried about a lot of things--because of

all the surgery Fidget has already been through, we had been warned to
watch for signs of adhesions and other intestinal problems, so we were
worried about that.  The doctor this time said it might be
pancreatitis, as some of his pancreatic enzymes were at elevated
levels.  She told us to put him on a low- or no-fat diet, and
recommended rice with turkey in it.

Well, Fidget doesn't like rice, it turns out.  He very carefully and
meticulously picked out all of the turkey bits and left the rice,
mostly on the floor around his bowl.  He would eat some of it if
coaxed, but eventually would just walk away and let Toby finish it up.
We wondered if Fidget might just be being picky, although we considered

it unlikely, since he had no problem eating dog biscuits, the pieces of

hot dog with his pills in it, or carrots (the bedtime snack of both
dogs--we started this with Jasmine, the previous dog, when she couldn't

have anything with sodium added to it, like dog treats).  So David gave

him some regular food.

Nope.

So we talked to the vet again, who says that Fidget might have an
intestinal blockage of some kind and might need surgery.  We called the

doctor who performed Fidget's miraculous surgery the first time,
because we figure if anyone can pull Fidget through, he can.  Fidget is

out there now, and will be there for a few days.  Today he had a barium

X-ray (did you know dogs can die just from the barium, if they vomit
and aspirate it?  I didn't, and wish I still didn't).  If that doesn't
show anything, they'll do an endoscopy and an ultrasound, looking for
an intestinal blockage.

But if none of that is conclusive, he will need surgery because that's
the only sure way to check for adhesions.  And he's had so much surgery

already.  And now David and I are looking at each other going, oh no,
not again.  We've already spent $700 on him this month, not counting
whatever today is going to cost.  It's not the money so much (though
that is chronically short here) as it is the emotional toll.  It took
us over two years to recover from Jasmine's death, and even though this

is probably going to turn out to be something simple (please please
please), we have that hanging over us as well.

Fidget doesn't act sick, except for the not eating.  He is perfectly
willing to play with Toby, either in his normal style or just running
through the apartment.  Fidget's normal style is very strange...he lies

on his back with his paws around his head making these "halp me, halp
me!" noises, while Toby runs around him and occasionally pokes him,
until Fidget jumps up with a "rowwwwRRRR!" and makes Toby jump back.
Then they do it again and again, until it's time to gallop out of the
room and go do it somewhere else, or to fall asleep until someone
offers food.

&lt;snip idiocy&gt;

&gt; Fidget is gone.

&gt; We've been trying to figure out what was wrong for almost two years, since
&gt; he stopped eating almost overnight, right at the same time Toby was
&gt; diagnosed with lung cancer.  He would eat intermittently, but not like he
&gt; had before.

&gt; They thought it might be pancreatitis.  They thought it might be IBD (and it
&gt; did get better when he was on steroids).  They thought it might be all kinds
&gt; of things.  Acupuncture seemed to help, for a while.  But what worked best
&gt; was the steroids, and every time we tried to taper him off, he'd stop eating
&gt; again.

&gt; His fur started falling out from the steroids, and his once lovely tail
&gt; became a skinny white stick.  He seemed happy enough, and didn't seem to be
&gt; in any discomfort--but he wouldn't eat unless coaxed.

&gt; We took him to a number of doctors, and each one thought of something
&gt; different.  Sometimes it helped for a while.  Sometimes he would eat when we
&gt; fed him by hand.  David made dog food from scratch, with all kinds of things
&gt; for nutrition and so that Fidget would eat it.  Sometimes that worked.  I
&gt; guess I don't need to say that we were worried in the extreme about this.

&gt; Finally David decided to take him to a dentist.  His most-recent vet said
&gt; she didn't think that would do anything, but we were at the grasping at
&gt; straws stage and it wouldn't hurt.

&gt; It turned out that Fidget had two abcessed teeth and one molar that was
&gt; cracked in two.  No wonder he didn't want to eat!  We had those teeth pulled
&gt; and he immediately perked up.  This was last fall.

&gt; But now he had liver damage, so we started treating that, and pancreatitis,
&gt; so we started treating that.  He was still happy, still seemed to be
&gt; enjoying life, and *eating*...but losing weight.

&gt; Not knowing was the worst thing.  Everybody could do tests, but nobody could
&gt; tell what was really going on.

&gt; David and I bought a vacation home in North Carolina last October, and David
&gt; started spending ten days or so a month there, usually with Fidget.  Fidget
&gt; really enjoyed having a yard of his own, and he would go outside with David
&gt; whenever he did yard work.  He was really relaxed down there, although he
&gt; was always glad to get back here.  But as long as he was down there, David
&gt; decided to take him to a vet down there who had never seen Fidget before and
&gt; didn't have a pile of paperwork on past problems.  He immediately switch his
&gt; medications around, and that helped even more.  The liver damage was
&gt; starting to heal, it seemed (at least the bloodwork was looking better).

&gt; But finally, Fidget was diagnosed with Addison's disease, and it was too
&gt; late to really do anything for it.  We started working on quality of life,
&gt; and also started giving him subcut fluids (which seemed to help more than
&gt; anything else).  Fidget still seemed to be having more good days than bad.
&gt; But then he went through two Addisonian crises in the space of two weeks,
&gt; one in North Carolina and one here in DC, and would have died from the
&gt; second one if we hadn't taken him to the vet ER.

&gt; When third one happened, we had some hard decisions to make.  He was so
&gt; weak, and still losing weight, and had developed a heart murmur on top
&gt; everything else.  I was the one who took him to the vet this time.  The
&gt; doctor wanted to admit him again, and I talked to her about what we'd
&gt; already been through.  I called David, and we decided it was time to let him
&gt; go.  David and a friend took a cab to the vet, and we held Fidget for the
&gt; last time, and told him what a good dog he'd been and that we loved him and
&gt; so did everybody else.  He let us know he loved us, too, and even managed
&gt; one last smile.  The doctor asked if we wanted to be present and we both
&gt; said &quot;Yes!&quot; at the same time.  We held Fidget as she gave him the shot.  He
&gt; was so weak that his heart stopped before he'd even had half of it.  This
&gt; was on May 25.  Our friend drove us home.

&gt; I realize now that Fidget hasn't been himself for a very long time.  I want
&gt; to remember the Fidget who stole a whole head of lettuce and tried to take
&gt; it under the bed (for the sport, since he didn't even like lettuce), the
&gt; Fidget who could stand on his hind legs and would, to try to see what food
&gt; was on the counter, the Fidget who was already eating his food before you
&gt; had the bowl all the way on the floor.  The Fidget who would hop up into
&gt; your lap, but would never stay very long, preferring instead to sleep on the
&gt; floor by your feet.  The Fidget who would &quot;arooooooo!&quot; for food.  The Fidget
&gt; with the con artist smile that said &quot;You aren't going to eat *all* of that,
&gt; are you?&quot;

&gt; I never felt that we &quot;owned&quot; Fidget.  He was very much a separate individual
&gt; who lived with us, but on his own terms.  David and I were his favorite
&gt; people, pretty much equally, but he loved everybody else not much less.  But
&gt; I keep expecting him to walk in here and curl up next to me, and it hurts
&gt; when that doesn't happen.  It hurts a lot.

&gt; Rest in peace, Fidget.  Your daddies love you.

&gt; David and I separated in February of this year, after thirteen years, so
&gt; Fidget came home today in two boxes.  Loss upon loss upon loss, too many
&gt; pieces out of my soul.  To quote (or more likely, paraphrase) Edna St.
&gt; Vincent Millay, &quot;life goes on/I forget just why.&quot;
