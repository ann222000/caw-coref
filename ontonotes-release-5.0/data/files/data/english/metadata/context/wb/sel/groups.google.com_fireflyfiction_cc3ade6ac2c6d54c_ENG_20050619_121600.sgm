He cursed. &quot;In the morning then.&quot;

Inara nodded and pulled away. &quot;I'll be happy to add you to my schedule, Mr.
Reynolds.&quot;

***

A shiver ran down Inara's spine as the airlock hissed and she found herself
looking, for the first time in months, at Serenity's interior. Everyone stood
there to greet her in a receiving line-type formation, eerily reminiscent of
how they'd said good-bye when she left. Companions were trained to be gracious
in a variety of situations. But this one, most definitely, had never been
covered. It was Kaylee who broke the silence first. Kaylee, who counted
precious few situations awkward. Kaylee, who bounded forward with a squeal to
throw her arm around Inara.

Then Simon, stiff with Core formality, &quot;It's nice to see you again.&quot; Sweet
Simon who'd responded to her first letter in great detail, letting her know how
everyone was doing when Kaylee had still been too hurt and confused. Inara had
known she would never hear from Mal, but to be ignored by Kaylee, however
briefly, had been an unexpected sting, softened by Simon's careful handwriting
and detailed doctor's eye. Then it was Book's turn and Wash's and River's and
Zoe's. And even Jayne's. Mal hung back, his only comment a gruff injunction to
move the conversation into the mess.

Inara wasn't sure how much of his mother's background Mal knew, and given his
feelings about companions she thought it wisest to leave the past out of her
explanation. Of course, that could be why he felt the way he did. It was easier
telling the story this time, even with all the interruptions and questions.
This time, Mal wasn't insisting she go away. &quot;Now you all know the situation,&quot;
Mal said. &quot;Suggestions?&quot;

It said a lot about how things had changed that Simon didn't immediately insist
that Mal undock the ship and try to run. It hurt in some vague way to know that
she'd missed that progression. &quot;You can never go home again,&quot; a voice whispered
in her head. She immediately squelched it. Serenity was not, had never been,
her home. Though she wished she'd been there when Kaylee had repainted the
walls. She'd written about it, of course, but it all looked so very different
than she imagined. It all looked so dissimilar, but it felt the same. And she
found herself stroking the walls as she listened to the crew debate.

&quot;If that's all true,&quot; Wash said. &quot;Leaving won't help.&quot;

Zoe nodded, taking her husband's hand in hers. &quot;They'll just find us again.&quot;

&quot;What'll we do?&quot; Kaylee asked.

&quot;I've already thought of that. Can you get blueprints of the cruise ship?&quot; he
asked Wash. At Wash's affirmative, Mal pinched the bridge of his nose and
rubbed his forehead tiredly. &quot;We'll have to kill Simon and River.&quot;

***

The meeting broke up soon after that. Inara promised Kaylee and River that
she'd make time to visit with them just as soon as things became a little less
life-threatening. To her surprise, Mal trailed her as she left Serenity. &quot;Have
you been spying on me?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;How did you happen to find out all of this?&quot;

&quot;I told you--the Companion's Guild has resources that--&quot;

Mal cut her off. &quot;Why was the Guild looking?&quot; he demanded.

Despite all of Inara's training she couldn't think up a lie fast enough. &quot;You
*were* spying on me,&quot; Mal crowed. Inara blinked in surprise. He was smiling. It
stole her breath away. The man's smile could charm stars out of the sky. &quot;Miss
me?&quot;

Inara took a deep breath. &quot;Yes.&quot;

The smile abruptly died on Mal's lips. Good, she wasn't the only one
off-balance.

&quot;Inara,&quot; he said, with something like a plea.

&quot;Don't, I can't--I,&quot;

His hand reached out to cup her chin. &quot;Then I will,&quot; he said and lowered his
mouth to hers.

Inara had thought a lot about what kissing Mal would be like, but she had never
imagined this. She had imagined a roughness perhaps, a certain untutored
passion, but not this explosion of sensation.

His lips were gentle against hers, nibbling sparks of pleasure. Her mouth
opened in a squeak of surprise, which gave him the opening he needed to slip
his tongue into her mouth. Heat and sweetness and a delicious bitterness
mingled together. Mal's tongue swirled against hers like a hot cup of tea mixed
with warm gold honey. He trembled against her, or maybe it was the other way
around. Her hands fisted into the back of his shirt, but she still couldn't
find a balance. Pleasure poured down her spine, and she would swear her toes
curled. There was nothing untutored about it. It went on and on, and Inara's
entire being contracted into a pinpoint of feeling, wet, yielding and aching
for something more.

Mal was the one who pulled away. &quot;Shoulda done that a long time ago,&quot; he
croaked.

&quot;I--&quot; Inara slowly fluttered her eyes open and closed her mouth. Her world was
spinning and her hands were shaking and there was nowhere for her to run. It
was too much, and it was all Mal's fault. *Thwap* Pushing him away hard, Inara
stumbled backward, her breathing too fast and loud. &quot;How can you think of
kissing at a time like this?&quot;

Mal shook his head slightly. So he was disappointed, *she* was the one whose
knees were wobbling. She had no sympathy whatsoever. &quot;Life is short, Inara. Too
damn short,&quot; he said. His hand swept across his collarbone as if to grasp
something that wasn't there. &quot;Shorter than it has any right to be.&quot;

She looked away then. &quot;We need to concentrate on what we're going to do about
River and Simon.&quot;

&quot;Tianxia suoyoude ren dou gaisi,&quot; he spit, causing her to whip her head back
around quickly. &quot;I can't run forever.&quot; His hand formed a fist, and if he'd been
standing a little closer to the wall he might have punched it. &quot;I thought I
could,&quot; he said. &quot;Thought if I just kept pushing out--but, it doesn't work that
way, I guess.&quot; His eyes pinned her, boring into her soul, and she knew he
wasn't just talking about himself. &quot;At some point, you gotta stop running.
Gotta put an end to it.&quot;

He stepped forward, brushing his fingertips gently over her lips. &quot;At some
point, a body gets caught.&quot;

&quot;Don't,&quot; she begged. &quot;Just don't.&quot; Mal's hand fell to his side; he stepped
back. She turned away, ignoring the ache in her chest.

***

It took only a few days to put everything together. Inara had the hardest part:
convincing the feds to wait. She felt her nerves jangling as the deadline
loomed closer. Inara was just getting ready to sleep when she heard the soft
knock at her door. She greeted Mal with surprise, but invited him in. &quot;I wasn't
expecting to see you tonight,&quot; she murmured, feeling an unusual discomfort at
being seen in her dressing gown.

He shrugged, pointedly not looking at the bare top-swell of her cleavage. &quot;I
needed to drop this off for tomorrow,&quot; he said, handing her a large metal
box.

&quot;It's smaller than I expected,&quot; she said.

&quot;It's collapsible,&quot; he corrected, showing her how to unbundle it. &quot;Kaylee's a
miracle worker. Don't know how Jayne got all the parts for her. Thought it
better not to ask, just told him to make sure it was stuff that wouldn't go
missing until we were all long gone.&quot; He laughed, rather fakely. &quot;Jayne can
sure steal ... stuff,&quot; he trailed off lamely.

She smiled at him. Putting others at ease was comfortable, familiar territory
for her. &quot;Did you get the rest of it taken care of?&quot;

&quot;Lifted the poem, that oughta convince 'em for a day longer. I also dropped the
gun off.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Biggest take I ever had, and I'll never get a
penny from it.&quot; He threaded his fingers through his hair. Comfortable, familiar
territory that she apparently wasn't very good at. At least, not when it came
to Malcolm Reynolds. &quot;I should probably go. Can't have a decent conversation
with someone who won't talk to you,&quot; he muttered.

She stiffened and stuck her arm out, blocking his path. &quot;I am the one who will
not talk to you?&quot; she hissed. &quot;Me?&quot; Her eyes were spitting fire. &quot;I have sent
several letters to Kaylee, one to Simon, several to the crew. Those ones, I
might add, were addressed to the crew in care of yourself as the captain.&quot; She
crossed her arms in front of her. &quot;I have received several letters back--from
Kaylee, from Simon, from Book. Wash wrote me once, and Zoe added a few lines.
River sent me a couple of pictures--&quot; she broke off as she remembered the
drawings. One of Kaylee smiling, standing on the docking ramp, leaning against
the entry way, obviously posed for, and one of Mal sitting on the catwalk
moodily with his legs over the side, obviously not. She shook her head to clear
it. &quot;I even got a letter from Jayne's mother, Mal!&quot;

He blinked. &quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;Don't try to sidetrack me!&quot; She stamped her foot. To hell with grace. &quot;All of
those letters, Mal, but not one, not one from you.&quot;

He tugged on his ear, and tried to smile disarmingly. &quot;Well, as to that--the
things I wanted to say to you aren't fit for a letter.&quot;

That sidetracked her. &quot;What--what things?&quot;

&quot;Gorramit,&quot; he swore, stepping toward her. Mal swept Inara into his arms and
carried her over to the bed.

&quot;Mal, what are you doing?&quot; she asked breathlessly.

&quot;Hell if I know,&quot; he said, unhooking his suspenders.

This was a very bad idea, she thought. She should--mmph, Mal certainly was good
with his hands.

Inara had had sex before, had experienced passion, tenderness. She had had *it*
in more feelings and forms than the average person knew possible. But
this--this single-minded assault on her senses was like unto nothing she had
ever known. She tried to gather her wits. She needed to tell Mal that--ohhh,
where had he learned that? She lost her train of thought as a tide of feeling
swamped her.

In the end she was left open and gasping, clinging to the shelter of Mal's body
and his trembling caresses, utterly destroyed.

***

When Mal awoke the next morning the bed was empty. He looked around the room
for a moment in confusion. Inara was at the mirror, hastily getting dressed,
putting her earrings on. He smiled broadly, but the good morning he'd been
about to utter died on his lips. Her hands were trembling. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he
said, rising from the bed. As she turned to him her face was set and drawn.

&quot;I have to ... leave,&quot; she replied. She took a deep breath and rested her hand
against the dressing table as if for support. &quot;I have an appointment.&quot;

He froze, the hand that had been reaching for her hanging in mid-air. &quot;An
appointment?&quot; he asked through clenched teeth, trying to remain calm. Surely
she didn't mean what he thought she meant.

&quot;A client, Mal,&quot; she clarified.

His eyes narrowed sharply, and a muscle in his jaw twitched. &quot;You're planning
to go from my bed to someone else's?&quot; he asked with deadly calm.

She looked away and stood. &quot;Yes.&quot; She moved toward the door on jerky legs. She
had barely touched the knob before he was on her, spinning her around
roughly.

&quot;Don't,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Inara, I--&quot;

&quot;Mal, I *have* to,&quot; she said.

&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Tianna, no, you don't. Gorramit. Stay here with me. We'll
figure something out, you can quit--&quot;

&quot;I don't want to quit,&quot; she cried. Her words shattered against him like glass.
He stared at her helplessly, his hands falling away. &quot;This isn't a job, Mal.
It's who I am.&quot;

&quot;A whore?!&quot;

She sucked in her breath, and closed her eyes in defeat. For a long moment,
they both stood there breathing harshly into the silence. Then she opened her
eyes as tears slipped down her cheeks. &quot;Yes, Mal. I am a whore,&quot; she said
tiredly, looking him in the eye with her chin raised.

&quot;Why?&quot;

A sudden sob racked her, before it was ruthlessly quelled. &quot;I wish I could
explain, but I *have* to go.&quot; There was a bitter edge to her voice. &quot;I will not
be late,&quot; she said. &quot;In this, I am a lady.&quot; She turned back toward the door.
With an air of finality, she brushed the tears from her cheeks and pasted a
tremulous smile upon her face.

&quot;If you walk out that door,&quot; Mal said desperately, &quot;I don't want you to come
back.&quot; She nodded once and pulled the door open. &quot;Inara, I'm begging you.
Don't--&quot; The door closed. He stared stupidly at it until the cold began to
touch him. He hadn't realized; he was naked.

***

Inara forced herself not to rush and tip her hand. She must not be too eager or
nervous at this stage. &quot;They're coming,&quot; she told them. &quot;They've agreed to meet
me in the solarium this evening. I've convinced them that it will be safe,
because everyone will be in the auction room.&quot;

&quot;What reason did you give for wanting to meet with them?&quot;

Inara smiled. She'd been prepared for this question. &quot;It is just so sad that
poor River and Simon are confined so much of the time on that ship. Capital
City is, after all, renowned as a center of horticulture. Of course, the
solarium here cannot compare. However, so many of the rim planets are sadly
lacking in distinctive vegetation, anything would seem rich in comparison. The
poor dears do get so little chance to treat themselves anymore.&quot; She winked at
the two men, though she had to choke on bile to do so. &quot;They will be there; you
just have to be ready.&quot;

The dark-haired man patted his pocket ominously. &quot;We've got everything we need.
Thank you for your service, Miss Serra.&quot;

&quot;Be sure to stick around afterward,&quot; the red-haired man added. &quot;We have a
reward for you.&quot;

Inara managed to just barely to repress a shudder. Even a badly trained
companion could have caught the double-meaning in that. Malevolence was no
excuse for sloppiness.

***

By prior agreement, Simon and River were to take the maintenance access tunnels
through the cruise ship to just outside the solarium in order to preserve the
fiction that they were afraid of being seen. Inara waited impatiently outside
where they were to emerge, all the while telling herself that just standing
about without looking as if one was just standing about was surely good
practice. For what, she was not sure. In any case, she was quite relieved when
they did indeed finally emerge. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she asked. Simon took a deep
breath and nodded tightly. But River smiled brightly up at Inara.

&quot;Gonna see the stars.&quot;

Inara pushed a button, and the door to the solarium slid open. For the rest of
her life the memory of River's not-in-the-least-bit-feigned scream would come
back to keep her awake at night.

Simon gasped in shock as the two men stepped forward and looked at Inara with
hurt and betrayal. &quot;You!&quot; Inara looked away, her heart thumping wildly. It was
too real. &quot;River,&quot; Simon cried, grabbing his sister's hand and charging blindly
down the hall away from the solarium. The two men tramped after them, and Inara
trailed behind.

Simon and River burst through the only doorway in the hall and seemed to stop
in confusion, belatedly realizing they had stormed into the auction.

The auctioneer stopped speaking as rows of people craned their necks to see
what the commotion was. Simon's eyes darted wildly around the room. He hurtled
up the center aisle, River in tow. Springing up onto the dais, he grabbed an
antique Lassiter off the display table. His trembling fingers flicked a switch
on its base and the gun roared to life. With shaking hands, he pointed it
toward the blue-handed men. &quot;Stay back,&quot; he ordered.

The two men looked around implacably. Inara wondered if a gun could even hurt
them. Too many witnesses, she thought to herself, as if she could make the two
men think it. Too many witnesses to display their invulnerability to. Too many
rich and powerful people with rich and powerful relatives who could make
inquiries were they to die.

For whatever reason, the blue-handed men did pause before taking hesitant steps
forward. &quot;There's no place to go,&quot; the dark-haired one said.

&quot;Back, I said!&quot; Simon yelled. River whimpered. He pushed her behind him and
slowly began to back toward a door at the side of the room The two men took
another step forward. Simon pulled the trigger. Instead of firing, a horrible,
shrieking whine started.

&quot;It's overloading,&quot; someone cried. With a look of desperation, Simon and River
turned and ran through the door they'd been inching toward. The two men
followed, but mere steps before they reached the door a boom tore from the room
and flames appeared at the window. Automatically, a lead wall dropped down from
the ceiling cutting off the room from view. &quot;Tianna,&quot; the auctioneer said.
&quot;That's where we store the extra oxygen tanks. The gun must have
overloaded.&quot;

The red-haired man paced over to him. &quot;Open it,&quot; he ordered.

&quot;Are you mad?&quot; the auctioneer said. &quot;That room is on fire.&quot;

&quot;Open it, now,&quot; the dark-haired man said, joining his comrade to loom over the
auctioneer.

&quot;I can't. This ship is built to automatically seal off that room in case of
fire and to open out into space until it's out. Once the temperature returns to
normal it'll close back up and the lead curtain will retract.&quot;

&quot;Those two are wanted criminals!&quot;

The auctioneer shook his head. &quot;You needn't worry about them. Even if they
survived the explosion, they're dead now. Sucked into space. No one could
survive that.&quot;

***

They'd be looking for someone to blame later, she knew, but she also knew they
already wanted her dead. Nowhere to go from there but up. She'd sort it out
later. Or rather Mal would. He could generally be counted on to survive
impossible situations and bring one or two people along with him. My, she was
in a mood. She was beginning to sound like Wash. Must be something to do with
having watched Simon and River explode to death in a fiery ball.

While the blue-handed men marched off to search Serenity, followed helpfully by
one or two hundred curious onlookers, she trudged back to her room.

She wanted to rush back to her stateroom, but of course, companions didn't
rush, especially when trying to appear beyond suspicion. Her face was grim and
drawn as she ambled back, not in the least bit hurried. Really.

She grinned in relief once she had the door to her room firmly shut. Simon's
helmeted face peered anxiously into her window. Of course it was. It was
supposed to be, but really it had been quite an impressive fireball. She spared
him a comforting smile before fetching the portable airlock Kaylee had designed
from under her bed. There was a whirring and a pop, then a clanging as Simon
emerged from the small tube. There was another clanging, then a pause. Inara
heard the whirring sound again, and then River emerged. The airlock fell away,
and it was as if the view port had never been moved. Mal clearly did not pay
Kaylee nearly what she was worth. Simon was paler than usual as he climbed out
of his suit.

&quot;I am so sorry,&quot; Inara began. &quot;I wanted to hurry, but --&quot;

Simon waved her apology away. &quot;No, no, we don't want to raise their
suspicions.&quot; He made a deprecating moue. &quot;It's just that I don't always get
these things on right even when I have more than thirty seconds to do so.&quot;

River rolled her eyes in the way of little sisters. &quot;He worries about
*everything,&quot;* she said disgustedly.

Inara laughed. &quot;They're searching Serenity now. After they don't find you --&quot;
she bit her lip. &quot;Well, hopefully--&quot;

&quot;Is the crew in any danger? These people--on Ariel--&quot;

She put a comforting hand on his arm. &quot;They cannot make an entire cruise ship
disappear,&quot; she said. &quot;And, thus, there are too many witnesses were something
to happen to the crew. We were lucky in that respect.&quot;

Simon snorted.

Inara smiled ruefully. &quot;Under the circumstances.&quot;

&quot;What about you? An accident of some sort to a single individual is a lot
easier to explain.&quot;

She sighed. &quot;I don't expect any visitors, but I suppose they'll want to stop by
and 'debrief' me. Beyond that--well, there's still Mother Jin-Mei. She knows
why I am here, and she's thoroughly connected in the Guild. She's old and sick,
but she never leaves the House.&quot;

&quot;They can't get to her.&quot;

Inara nodded. &quot;They'll wait until nature takes its course.&quot;

&quot;You mean they'll wait until there's no one to remember that you were here.&quot;

&quot;If they show up to talk, we can hide in the bathroom, I suppose.&quot; Simon looked
at his sister. &quot;That'll work?&quot;

River bit her lip and grasped her arm, shivering. &quot;No special senses,&quot; she
said. &quot;They won't 'see' us.&quot; Another change, Inara thought. Whatever gifts
River had, it seemed Simon was comfortable enough with them to ask her to use
them.

&quot;We should get some sleep,&quot; Inara said finally. &quot;Make sure we are ready for
whatever tomorrow brings.&quot;

&quot;River, why don't you go ahead and wash up first?&quot; Simon suggested.

Inara was puzzled as she saw the girl wink at her brother as she left the room.

&quot;Inara,&quot; Simon said, hesitating. Whatever he felt he needed to say, it clearly
made him uncomfortable. &quot;The captain seemed a bit upset when he came in this
morning.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm?&quot; Inara said politely.

&quot;Quite. Despite having returned, as I mentioned, this *morning.&quot;*

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; There was an awkward pause. It seemed that since she had left
Serenity, Simon had finally learned when to let things go. He opened his mouth.
On the other hand, as bad as Simon had been at knowing when to be quiet, she
remembered that he was even worse at actually doing so.

&quot;Is there a point to all this or are you merely trying to make conversation?&quot;
she asked, before he could continue.

&quot;I am trying to be your friend. Serenity's been a different place without you.
It's obvious that--look, you said you were going away to find out what you are.
I had hoped by now you would know.&quot;

&quot;I am a companion,&quot; she stated firmly. She held his gaze for all of ten seconds
before crumpling. &quot;I am a companion, and Mal thinks I am a whore.&quot;

Simon took her hand. &quot;He doesn't really. He's just trying to protect himself.
He loves you.&quot;

Inara scoffed. &quot;He has an odd way of showing it.&quot;

Simon grinned mischievously. &quot;Mal has an odd way of doing, well, everything, I
have noticed.&quot;

&quot;He does indeed,&quot; she laughed. She took her hand away. &quot;I'm sorry, I know
you're trying to be helpful. Simon, I--.&quot; Inara looked away, the tightening of
her lips the only sign of inner distress. &quot;Didn't you ever wonder why they
chose me to work for them? I was an informer for the Alliance,&quot; she said. &quot;In a
way.&quot;

Simon rocked back as if he'd been slapped. His face turned starkly pale under
the lamp light. &quot;River,&quot; he gasped.

&quot;No,&quot; Inara assured. &quot;Simon, I would never, *will* never tell anyone about her,
but I can't--I can't stay. Mal wouldn't even want me to.&quot;

Simon sighed. &quot;I don't know what happened between the two of you.&quot; He raised a
hand to quell her when she started to speak. &quot;It's none of my business.&quot; He
tugged at his lip. &quot;But you are wrong if you don't think that Mal wants you to
come back. When I said that Serenity was a different place without you, well,
the truth is that Mal has been a different man. Whatever he says, he needs
you.&quot; Simon held out his arm to reveal the long scratch running down it. &quot;River
didn't feel like taking any tests the other day. She wasn't really trying to
hurt me; she was just--&quot;

&quot;Protecting herself.&quot;

&quot;Mal finds it easier to fight than admit that he doesn't think he has anything
you want.&quot; She didn't answer. &quot;Just promise me that if he comes to see you, you
will hear him out.&quot;

&quot;Simon, I can't--&quot;

&quot;Then you're a fool, Inara, and I know you are not. You know I'm not here just
because I'm worried about Mal. If I thought you were happy--&quot; River came out of
the bathroom then, ending the discussion. Simon spared one last hard glance at
Inara, and then went in himself.

***

*Mal looked down Main Street in confusion. He couldn't for the life of him
remember why he'd come in to town. &quot;Why Malcolm Reynolds, is that you?&quot; a jolly
voice behind him cried.*

*Mal spun around to see an old man sweeping the walkway in front of the store.
&quot;Mr. Blue!&quot; He hastily tipped his hat. &quot;How are you, sir?&quot;*

&quot;*Just fine, just fine. Would you like a piece of candy, Malcolm?&quot; Mr. Blue
asked.*

&quot;*No, sir,&quot; Mal said. The wind picked up. Mal hugged his coat tighter around
him. &quot;I was just on my way to--.&quot; The wind stirred the dust in the street,
stinging his eyes. Mal blinked his eyes and for a moment it seemed as if Mr.
Blue had disappeared. He blinked his eyes again, clearing his vision. It seemed
awfully quiet; he turned and looked the other way down the street. There was no
one in sight. &quot;Mr. Blue, where is everyone?&quot;*

&quot;*Oh, I expect they're at the bar, son. You're running a bit early, ain't ya?&quot;*

&quot;*Early? I--I don't know.&quot; Mal said. &quot;Feels like I've been gone forever. Just
how long--&quot; But as he turned, he saw Mr. Blue was gone.*

*Across the street, a sign was flashing &quot;Welcome. Come on in.&quot; Mal walked into
the building, down a long flight of stairs into the bar.*

*The air was thick with smoke and muggy from body heat, but the lively strains
of a fiddle filtered through the hall.*

*As Mal's eyes adjusted to the relative gloom indoors, he saw that on what
passed for a stage, some of his Ma's hands had formed a band. He moved deeper
through the crowd, pausing when he noticed that Dan and Margarita were dancing.
His ma had written him that they'd been planning to divorce. He guessed she'd
been wrong.*

&quot;*Malcolm!&quot; He spun around quickly, his heart nearly in his throat.*

&quot;*Ma!&quot; he hollered, throwing his arms around her and catching her in a big hug.
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;*

&quot;*We'd been takin' bets on when you was getting here,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess I
just lost.&quot; She pulled away. &quot;Well, let me look at ya. Aren't you fine? Still
wearing that old brown coat, I see. You got to give it up one of these days,
son.&quot;*

*Mal laughed. &quot;Who's we?&quot; he said.*

*She drew him over to the back wall where Butch and Jimmy John were arguing
Holsteins versus Herefords while they played pool. An old man sat on a stool
nearby watching. &quot;Captain Perkins, sir,&quot; Mal said, saluting hurriedly.*

&quot;*Sergeant Reynolds,&quot; the man said with a nod. &quot;I'm retired now.&quot; He winked at
Mal's ma. &quot;That means you don't have to salute, but you do have to buy me a
drink.&quot;*

*Mal patted his pockets in consternation. &quot;I'd like to buy everyone a drink,
but I don't think I--&quot; he stopped as felt a lump. With surprise, he drew out a
small bundle of cash. &quot;Will you look at that?&quot; he whooped. &quot;Enough for everyone
and a few more for me besides.&quot;*

&quot;*You might want to leave the Wang brothers out,&quot; his ma cautioned. She nodded
to where they stood by the fireplace, throwing back whiskey and singing to the
chorus at the top of their lungs. &quot;I hope they brought steady horses. Ain't no
other way they're going to make it back to Silver City tonight.&quot;*

&quot;*Aw, quit fussing, Miz Reynolds, we all know you're gonna offer to let 'em bed
down at the ranch tonight,&quot; Butch said with a smile.*

&quot;*Oh, go back to your game,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Can you believe the sass I'm
getting, Malcolm?&quot;*

*Mal was grinning ear-to-ear as he looked around the place. &quot;Don't think you
can con me into taking sides,&quot; he warned. &quot;I don't know why, but I just feel so
good,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone's here, Ma. Everyone, I--.&quot; As his eyes strayed to
the top of the stairs, he saw her. Inara. She was looking around the room,
searchingly, and then he caught her eye. She smiled broadly. &quot;Just a minute,
Ma,&quot; Mal said.*

&quot;*I've missed you, son, but not so much that I need you hanging around. I told
you I didn't expect you for a long time yet.&quot; She shooed him with her hands.
&quot;Get.&quot;*

*He pushed through the crowd and ran to the top of the stairs. &quot;Inara,&quot; he
said.*

&quot;*Mal.&quot; She grinned and held out her hand.*

*He took it, leading her down the stairs. &quot;I'm so glad you came,&quot; he said.
&quot;There's someone I want you to meet.&quot; He couldn't remember a time he'd ever
been happier.*

&quot;*Ma, Ma!&quot; he called. &quot;Where'd you go?&quot;&quot;Ma?&quot;*

&quot;Mal. Mal.&quot; He woke with a start, dimly taking in the pounding on his door.

&quot;Come on in, Zoe,&quot; he shouted. He stood and stretched, yawning. The
interruption had blown the dream right from his mind. He wondered what it'd
been about. He felt like he'd lost something important.

&quot;They've gone, Mal,&quot; Zoe said as she came down the ladder into his bunk.

&quot;We sure?&quot; he asked, pulling on his pants.

&quot;Kaylee was stationed in the air duct by the airlock like you said. They
definitely got on the ship; it took off half an hour ago.&quot;

He nodded, pulling on a clean shirt, and tucking it into his pants. &quot;Good, is
it morning yet?&quot;

&quot;Barely, sir.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; he grimaced, but continued. &quot;Don't know what Inara's schedule was
like last night. We can wait a bit to go fetch the doc and his sister. Make
sure we're not disturbing her sleep.&quot; He snapped his suspenders. &quot;Although,
might be she'd appreciate us showing up as soon as possible. Probably wants to
get back to her life.&quot;

&quot;Sir?&quot; Zoe said cautiously. &quot;About Inara, sir--&quot;

&quot;Nothing to say about that.&quot;

&quot;Xia shuo, sir.&quot; Zoe shook her head. &quot;As long as I've known you, sir, you ain't
been a quitter. You've gotten us in to some pretty stupid situations because of
it, too.&quot;

&quot;Well, thank you very much!&quot; he snapped. Zoe eyed him reproachfully, and he
swallowed, feeling like a naughty boy.

&quot;What you and Inara have, sir, it's worth more than any two-bit take we ever
got. It's sure as hell worth fighting just as hard for. Do you really want to
go through the rest of your life wondering if only you'd said something it
could've made a difference?&quot; Zoe turned around to leave, but paused at the
doorway. &quot;You just think on that, Mal. If I were you, I'd wait a bit to fetch
the Tams. Maybe clean myself up a bit first.&quot; She stalked out of the room,
leaving Mal stroking the stubble on his chin thoughtfully.

It was Mal who came to tell Simon and River that it was safe to make their way
back to Serenity.

They weren't gone five minutes when Mal was back knocking at her door. &quot;I left
the poem here when ... you know.&quot;

She turned around and looked. It had been sitting on the vanity ever since, and
she'd never noticed. She walked over to get it, but it wasn't until she heard
the click of the door that she realized Mal had followed her.

As always, he was direct. &quot;I want you to come back to Serenity.&quot;

Inara closed her eyes, and tried to calm her heart. His words should not mean
so much to her. &quot;The Companion's Guild rules for dating are complicated.&quot;

He scoffed, &quot;You think I want to date you?&quot; He pursed his lips as he walked
farther into the room. &quot;Hiding behind rules is beneath you.&quot;

&quot;Mal, I don't know. If I go back with you, if I go back to Serenity and we
can't make it work, it would break my heart.&quot;

&quot;Mine's already breaking,&quot; he said, his voice low and urgent. &quot;Inara, I don't
want to spend my life lost in the woods.&quot;

&quot;But we are lost, Mal. I keep thinking that we're going to get past this, and
then we don't,&quot; she said. &quot;When I'm with you, everything is perfect and
wonderful, and I feel so happy--&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Mal said.

&quot;--And then I don't. Because it isn't. It doesn't matter whose fault it is,
Mal. It's just the way it is. We're like, like--&quot; She looked wildly around the
room. Her eyes landed on the ancient, cracked and crumbling scroll. &quot;Like this
fragment of a lost poem,&quot; she said, indicating the scroll. &quot;There is always
going to be a piece missing, Mal.&quot;

&quot;It doesn't have to be that way,&quot; Mal said.

&quot;Whether it has to be that way or not, that's the way it is, Mal. I'm a
companion. I can't--I won't give that up. What would you have me do? Do you
want to hire me as the cook? Maybe I can help Kaylee with the engine? Or take
up knife-collecting with Jayne?&quot; She tossed her head. &quot;Or will I earn my keep
as your private whore?&quot;

&quot;Don't,&quot; he warned, his voice dangerously low.

&quot;I am a companion, Mal. That is all I know I how to be. And you can't handle
it, you proved that the other day.&quot;

&quot;One time, Inara. That was one time. A man can be forgiven for being
surprised--for acting badly when he hears that--&quot;

&quot;I'm always going to be a whore to you, Mal. I can't forgive that, not anymore.&quot;

&quot;Inara,&quot; he pleaded, gripping her arms tightly. &quot;When we leave here--if they
know all you say they do we're gonna need a new ship. Gonna have to find new
routes, avoid the old places, push out to new ones. Get off the grid until
we're sure they think River and Simon are dead. Do you understand what I'm
saying? You can't change your mind. You won't be able to find us.&quot;

She pulled away. &quot;I won't change my mind.&quot;

He stepped in front of her, blocking her escape. &quot;I'm not going to let you
throw us away like this. I love you,&quot; he yielded.

She gaped, quite suddenly sure that he had never said the words to anyone but
her in his life. At least, not with that meaning.

There are some things that once said, can never be taken back. There are some
words that you should never throw back in a man's face. So it was with
devastating deliberation that Inara looked Mal straight in the eye, and told
him, &quot;I don't believe you. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I apologize. I should
never have slept with you. I should have remembered. Things fall apart when I
try to be something other than I am. I really am very sorry, Mal, but
companions don't fall in love.&quot;

Once again, Inara found herself walking away from the very person she wanted to
run to.

She was standing out in the hall when she realized that they'd been in her
room. She walked the ship, and when she finally returned hours later, Mal was
gone.

***

He'd lost. Well, that was fine. It wasn't the first time, wouldn't be the last.
He'd had lots of experience being on the losing side. Just keep going. Had a
job to do. He walked onto the ship with leaden feet. The job. Just do the
job.

They were in the cargo bay, doing tian xiaode when he walked in. Waiting on
him. Well, gorram, of course they were. He was the captain after all. Be the
captain.

&quot;All right, we got one more day until our contract with the cruise is up. We're
gonna stay, maintain our cover. River and Simon'll lay low. Jayne and Zoe can
do security. Wash, Kaylee, you start looking for places to go. We're gonna have
to push out; far enough to be off the radar, not so far we can't sell the ship
and find jobs.&quot;

&quot;Sell Serenity?&quot; Kaylee cried.

&quot;The Alliance can tie it to us. We gotta keep them from tracking us, long
enough to convince 'em the Tams really are dead. Besides,&quot; he said, &quot;Leaving
the Alliance behind was always the plan.&quot;

&quot;But selling your ship?&quot; Simon sounded horrified.

&quot;She ain't worth dying for.&quot;

&quot;But ...&quot; Simon sighed and turned anguished eyes on Mal. &quot;It's not fair.&quot;

&quot;It surely ain't,&quot; Mal agreed. &quot;Life ain't, Doc, you know that.&quot; Mal tugged on
his ear. Good advice, that. He should have remembered it himself.

&quot;I suppose I do; I just, I never wanted to get anyone else involved in all
this.&quot;

Mal shrugged. &quot;I'm a big boy, son. She ain't worth all this hand-wringing.&quot; He
wished they'd all stop looking at him. He closed his eyes. &quot;I'm taking a shift
tonight,&quot; he said. &quot;Better get some rest. Be in my bunk until then.&quot;

He didn't even bother to lie down, knowing he'd hear the click of her boots on
his ladder before his head even hit the pillow.

&quot;Mal?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;She doesn't want me, Zoe,&quot; Mal said.

Zoe and Mal had been through a lot together, but she'd never had to wipe away
his tears before.

***

Inara was surprised to see Zoe in the hall, until she remembered that Serenity
was ostensibly here to provide security. &quot;I was just heading back to the ship,&quot;
Zoe said. &quot;I had to escort a few people to the safe. Folks are jumpy.&quot; She
paused. &quot;Can we talk?&quot;

Inara gestured to the nearby solarium. There were benches and relative privacy
inside. They walked silently until they found a suitable stopping place. Zoe
sat down next to Inara. Inara smiled at her hesitantly, but Zoe didn't say
anything, just pulled a few items out of her jacket and began cleaning her gun
silently. She seemed to be searching for words. After a long moment, she
sighed. &quot;Did you know Wash fought in the war?&quot; Zoe asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Inara answered, puzzled. She had expected something else. &quot;He spent the
last few years in a P.O.W. camp, I believe.&quot;

&quot;That's right,&quot; Zoe said. &quot;He was there for a long time. The man had barely
started when he got picked up.&quot; She paused and stopped to study the gun stock,
looked at her kit and selected some polish. &quot;After he'd been there awhile, they
started having problems with the supply lines. The camp wasn't much of a
priority. Who cares if enemy soldiers have enough to eat? Most people in charge
at a place like that would have fed their own people first, prisoners be
damned. But the guy in charge where Wash was at didn't feel that way. He and
those under him shared what food they could get equally with the prisoners. So
they all starved together.&quot; Zoe paused again in her work and studied Inara out
of the corner of her eye. &quot;Wash told me that it made him really respect the
Independents.&quot;
