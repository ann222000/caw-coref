How Narasimhadeva defeated Tugan Khan in 1248 C.E.   After the easy victories over North India from Punjab, through Bengal, the Muslims turned to attack Orissa. Here the Muslims met their match. The people of Orissa were hardy fighters. (In ancient and medieval times, Orissa was also called Kalinga or Utkal – from Uttam Kala which means ‘Excellent Art’ that reflects the artistic tradition of sculpture of that region) The bravehearts of Orissa had given a hard time to Samrat Ashoka Mauya, when in the 3rd century B.C.E. Kumara, the king of Kalinga, gave a tough battle to the Mauryan invader, before Orissa could be annexed to the Maurya Empire.   Now in the 13th century, when Tugan Khan attacked Orissa, the then ruling king of Orissa, Narsimhadeva, decided to use subterfuge against the Muslims. He sent word to the invader that he wanted to surrender without a fight, as had Lakshmansena, the ruler of Bengal.   Tugan had easily conquered Bengal a few years before attacking
Orissa. He found Bengal to be easy meat as the king of Bengal instead of fighting fled the advancing Muslim armies and Begal fell without a fight. Having tasted blood in Bengal, Tugan thought that the conquest of Orissa would also be a cakewalk.       ______________________________      The victorious King of Orissa, Narasimhadeva erected a victory pillar designed as a war chariot. This temple was dedicated to Surya the Sun god, at a location near the temple town of Puri. He named this place Konark which means “Essence of the Corners” While the structure commemorates the victory in the battle against the Muslims, the name Konark commemorates the science of astronomy of which the King was an avid student.   __________________________________       Tugan boasted that he had put the fear of death in the heart of the Hindus and could overrun the entire country in a single campaign. But Narasimhadeva had other ideas. He decided to use the Muslims’ patent tool subterfuge against
the enemy. He sent word to Tugan that Orissa was ready to surrender to the Muslims without a fight, as had its neighbor Bengal. Tugan accepted Narasimhadeva’s surrender proposal and asked for the surrender of the major city of Puri that was an important Hindu Pilgrim center (Narasimhadeva had his capital elsewhere at Jajanagara). Tugan’s other conditions included handing over all weapons to the Muslim army, the embracing of Islam by the entire population in the central square in front of the Jagannath Temple or agreeing to pay Jazia and to convert the Jagnnath temple at Puri into Mosque as a acknowledgement of submission.   To the delight of the Muslims, all these terms were accepted and the Muslims advanced into the city, blissfully unaware that the shrewd Hindu king had laid a trap for them. On the orders of Narasimhadeva, the bustling city had been completely evacuated of its pilgrims, the aged and children; and professional soldiers from all over the kingdom had
occupied every nook and cranny of the city, hidden away inside the closely built houses across the narrow winding lanes.   Once the Muslim army was inside the city, it had to disperse itself into the maze of narrow lanes and bylanes with which they were not familiar and where they had to dismount from their horses and advance single file.   Unaware of the danger lurking they advanced cautiously and slowly towards the central square where the surrender ceremony was to take place.   When the Muslim army was so dispersed, at a prearranged signal from one of lookouts from the temple spires, the temple bells started ringing, and this was the signal for the Hindus to pounce on the Muslims. The pitched battle lasted one whole day and went into the night pierced by the cries of wounded and dying Muslim and Hindu soldiers. While the Hindus took many losses, the entire Muslim army was caught like as in a mousetrap, and annihilated. Very few Muslims could escape this trap.   This
bold and unorthodox idea succeeded, and it caught the Muslim totally off-guard as it had never been used till then, by any Hindu king, as it went against the Hindu rules of warfare based on fair-play and fighting a noble war.   But precisely because of it being totally unexpected, the Muslims had to suffer a bloody nose and the Hindus emerged victorious. COnsequently Orissa was to remain a Hindu bastion for many centuries and this accounts for the very low percentage of Muslims in Orrisa even today, unlike Bengal, where the eastern part (known today as Bangladesh) has been totally Islamized, and the Western half of Bengal is undergoing the process of Islamization especially in the district of Murshidabad.   The victorious King of Orissa, Narasimhadeva erected a victory pillar designed as a war chariot. This temple was dedicated to Surya the Sun god, at a location near the temple town of Puri. He named this place Konark which means “Essence of the Corners” While the
structure commemorates the victory in the battle against the Muslims, the name Konark commemorates the science of astronomy of which the King was an avid student.   Although the Hindus of south India, like the Kings of Vijaynagar and the Marathas of Pune, displayed this shrewdness against the Muslims; in the North the Rajputs continued to wage a noble war with the ignoble Muslims and lost out. It was for this reason, that the Muslims could never entirely subjugate the Southern half of India (Dakkan or Deccan from Dakshin which means south in Sanskrit) as they did with North India.

Dear Sir
This is the todays news in http://in.news.yahoo.com/070227/139/6ckiz.html

By ANI
Tuesday February 27, 06:25 PM
New Delhi, Feb.27 (ANI): The Centre has received 18 proposals from various State Governments during the last three years for the setting up of new Central Universities in the States. They include two each from the State Governments of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Tripura and one each from the State Governments of Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Manipur, Orissa, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, Uttranchal and West Bengal . Due to constraints on resources, only five proposals - four by way of conversion, one each from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh, and one for new University in the State of Sikkim - have been implemented. Minister of State for Human Resource Development D.Purandeswari disclosed this in the Lok Sabha today. (ANI)

Dear Readers,

This is an interesting Article.

Perhaps, the bright past would inspire the present day  Oriyas  to
demonstrate the same vlalour, courage, determination, skill and shrewdness
today to come out as leaders in all fields including Science, Defence,
Engineering, Management, Civil Services, etc.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty
