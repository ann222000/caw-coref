Cleanup of Asopos begins
Firms dumping waste into the river will be punished, minister says

Bulldozers yesterday started clearing up the riverbed of the heavily
polluted Asopos, in central Greece, as Environment and Public Works
Minister Giorgos Souflias pledged to purge the toxic water believed to
be posing a cancer risk to local residents.

Souflias, who has rebuffed calls by opposition parties and
environmentalists for the creation of a separate environment ministry,
yesterday announced a series of measures to curb pollution in the
river. These include inspections on local manufacturers, many of which
are believed to be dumping untreated waste into the river, followed by
the imposition of fines - or revocation of licenses - in cases of
those found to have acted illegally.

Meanwhile, state environment officials are overseeing an initiative to
clear rubbish from the riverbed and detect secret pipes allegedly
being used by some firms to dispose of their toxic waste.

Already 10 manufacturers have been found to be illegally disposing of
toxic refuse. This number is expected to rise once officials determine
which firms have illegally installed the pipes.

Souflias, who described the initiative as an «important national
project,» launched the action after tests on underground water
reserves in Viotia and Attica revealed high levels of carcinogenic
depleted chromium.

Earlier this month, the Municipality of Oropos, north of Athens, which
draws its drinking water from the Asopos, instructed some of its
residents to stop consuming tap water after tests found it to be
toxic.

Residents in nearby Oinofyta have also been advised to avoid drinking
tap water for the same reason.

Last month, Souflias's ministry agreed to cooperate with the Athens
water board and local authorities on the construction of a new
pipeline that will draw water from a local reservoir rather than the
Asopos.

In addition to the Asopos drive, the ministry is planning initiatives
to clean up the Kifissos River and Lake Koroneia, sources said. Last
week a Thessaloniki prosecutor launched a preliminary investigation
into conditions at Lake Koroneia after more than 200 birds were found
dead nearby. The prosecutor wants to determine why a project to
protect the lake has been delayed, even though -24 million in funding
has been made available.
