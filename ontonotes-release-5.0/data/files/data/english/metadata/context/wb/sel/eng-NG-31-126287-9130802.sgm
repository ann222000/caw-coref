Are the menu items hard coded in Synchronet, or is there a way the change
them..... Example: &quot;O&quot; or &quot;/O&quot; for logoff, can I change it to &quot;G&quot; for
goodbye. I have looked all over in the config for this and can't find it.
Just curious. Thanks in advance.

I saw that, and understand it. What I was asking, is there a way to change
the hard code. I don't want to use the same letters as the default. I am
trying to make it look and feel like the bbs I ran for years GAP. I know I
can't duplicate it perfectly, but I would like to change some of the command
letters. If I am overlooking something simple, please point me in the right
direction. Thanks.

No, they are not.

The commands are not in the config. You change them within the
default.src file. Then you recompile the file with baja.exe and rerun
Synchronet to reload the changed file.

There are several different menus already there. Log onto you board via
telnet and look in the &quot;D&quot;efault user area under command shells.

Synchronet uses what is known as a &quot;Command Shell&quot; .. you can have more than
one, or just one... these are written in either Baja (an old basic-like
language created for Synchronet early on), or JavaScript (Using Synchronet's
object model).

The default shell is located in sbbs's exec directory.. see default.src ...
when you change this, you should copy default.src to your mods/ folder. (by
default this folder should be in the same folder next to exec)... after you
have edited the default.src file, you will then need to compile it with the
baja compiler.

from a command prompt, as an example...
C:\sbbs\mods\&gt; ..\exec\baja default.src

this will create a default.bin in your mods folder that will be used instead
of the default.bin in the exec folder.

Worth noting, you don't need to reload sync, just the shell... if you change
shells and back, that should be enough to work... since my js shells are
loaded from baja, I can ctrl-c at my main menu, which drops to the baja,
caught at a pause prompt, then re-executes the js... which was really nifty in
testing.. ;)  ... also had to test for a changed shell after running the user
settings so I could drop out of js when changing shells...

Not sure if there is a re-login baja command that can do the same inherently...

yes, you edit the default.src with a text editor and then compile it with baja.
i.e. baja default.src

Hm... If you read those docs, I would you already understood that the commands
aren't hard coded.

&gt; I don't want to use the same letters as the default.

Then modify the command shell you're using. Synchronet comes with multiple
command shells and all of them can be modified.

&gt; I am
&gt; trying to make it look and feel like the bbs I ran for years GAP. I know I
&gt; can't duplicate it perfectly, but I would like to change some of the command
&gt; letters. If I am overlooking something simple, please point me in the right
&gt; direction. Thanks.

See docs/*.src and read baja.html. Once you've done that and you still have
questions, let us know.

&gt;  &gt; The commands are not in the config. You change them within the
&gt;  &gt; default.src file. Then you recompile the file with baja.exe and rerun
&gt;  &gt; Synchronet to reload the changed file.

&gt; You don't have to rerun Synchronet when modifying command shells or modules.

he probably is referring to the scenerio where the sysop is logged onto the
bbs, testing his command shell, makes a change via drop to dos or whatever
and recompiles. he'd have to logoff or launch that bin again to see the
changes.

There are other ways to reload a command shell besides logging off, but anyway,
he said &quot;rerun Synchronet&quot;, and I was simply clarifying that that wasn't
necessary.
