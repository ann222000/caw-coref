A few days ago, I complained about my Motorola V557 phone discharging
too quickly when I used it as a model (with a linux laptop and
bluetooth). It also is way too slow to charge.

Since then, I bought an extra cheapo wall wart charger, cut its DC
cord and found out the following:

1) Open circuit voltage is about 5.81 VDC
2) When charging, the voltage is about 5.61 VDC

I also experimented with my phone and a lab style HP DC power supply.
I found out that the phone starts charging when voltage reaches
approximately 4.8-4.9 volts.

So, my thinking goes, if I can get a power source that would be
limited to about 5.6 volts, then I couls safely use that as a
supplement to the cell phone battery. I would just take the plug from
the cheapo charger mentioned above, solder it to that hypothetical
source, and plug my phone into that.

I found out that eBay has plenty of 6V rated Nicad battery packs for
remote controlled toys. There is plenty of new packs sold with 3 hr
chargers.

So, I decided to buy a 6v pack/charger combo, and add a little voltage
limiter so that the voltage that the phone sees, never exceeds
5.6v. That limiter can be a simple linear regulator type of thing, I
will try to just buy some TO-220 chip on Digikey for simplicity.
