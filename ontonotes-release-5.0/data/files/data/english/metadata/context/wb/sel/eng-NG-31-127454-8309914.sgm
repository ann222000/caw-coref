Excerpts:

&quot;In Deathly Hallows, we get a good look at the ultimate embodiment of
evil, Lord Voldemort, who turns out to be essentially a Hitler wannabe
with a penchant for racial purity, mass graves and general
totalitarian mayhem. Painted in broad strokes, his brand of evil--
revealed early in his habit of torturing, what else, rabbits--doesn't
add up to much more than a rehashed, cartoonish version of tyranny
that the reader can safely be relied on to despise. For all his
cutting-edge terrorist strategy in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince, Voldemort finally reveals himself to be a cardboard imitation
of an old-fashioned kind of baddie, like Tolkien's Sauron.

&quot;Rowling's ham-handed characterization of Voldemort is in stark
contrast to her depiction of a far more insidious and contemporary
kind of evil, one captured so brilliantly in the bright-eyed malice of
Dolores Umbridge, the Grand Inquisitor in Harry Potter and the Order
of the Phoenix. In the Ministry of Magic--originally led by Cornelius
Fudge, who is later replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour in Half-Blood Prince--
Rowling points her finger at elected officials hellbent on preserving
their power at the expense of their citizens, wresting basic rights,
eroding freedoms and manipulating information, all in the name of
maintaining order. But in her final book, Rowling simply sweeps aside
the multitude of the Ministry's sins in the wake of Voldemort's bloody
coup. His far more spectacular crimes offer a good excuse to turn
Scrimgeour into an unlikely hero of sorts. He's just one of the good
guys, though a little unsavory in his methods, Rowling assures
us......&quot;

Lenona.

P.S. In a way, I find Crouch Jr. more scary than Voldemort - in fact,
Wormtail is almost as frightening. Then again, even the mostly unseen
character Arawn (created by the late Lloyd Alexander) is significantly
more frightening.

The thing that always annoyed me about Lord V was that he was NEVER
especially EVIL...???
It seems to me, that in about 10 years or so, when some independant
filmmaker does a remake of these books/films, they should just have LV
obsessed with his immortality, and then paint in Harry Potter as a
vengeful lunatic that is seeking justice for his parents death, but it
turns out that LV never had anything to do with it, and the scar is a
simple birthmark, and his percieved fame is due to a schizophrenic
delusion. that would make it all more consistent and more interesting.

Great idea.  Why not write a book?
