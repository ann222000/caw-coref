Hi,

Was just wondering.... My website 'Frank Zappa-
Highly Ambient Domains' seems to be no more!!!! WTF???? I got this
when I tried to get into it: Sorry, the account had been abused and
locked.

This pisses me off. I've had this about 7 years with
over 1/2 million hits on Tripod. Anyone got any ideas? I have yet to
get reply from Tripod/Lycos....

BTW, Marc, yes I'm still around. Grade 3 not 4,
found out AFTER 4 years (rolls eyes). I'm still kickin' it, just got
married a month ago!!!!

~~H.

Did you pay for the domain?
If not maybe the many hits explain why they took it off.
Too bad.

But do they have a bandwidth limit? Many ISPs do and &quot;forget&quot; to mention
that in the site usage T&amp;C.

Exactly, free sites that get a lot of traffic like the &quot;Highly Ambient
Domains&quot; are not what the guys that host those sites have in mind.
Nothing is free in this world.

Its not that expensive. A top level domain is only a few dollars a year.
I see that ambientdomains.org and highlyambient.org are both available
in case you're interested.

Even in the UK I can get 50 MB of web hosting space for GBP 70 a year,
so you should be able to find web hosting for less and I think I'm
paying just under GBP 20 for a .org domain - national domains are
cheaper. IOW web and domain services cost me less the price of one beer
a week.

You can separate the different items out:
- select a web host on price etc.
- use an ISP with free email
- use a domain host service to host your domain name. All it needs to do
is to redirect web requests to your web host and forward email to your
mail service
- set your mail reader's From address to match your domain name.

That's pretty much how my setup has worked for the last 4 years.
