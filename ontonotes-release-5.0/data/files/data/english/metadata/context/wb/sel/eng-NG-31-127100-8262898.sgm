Survey: Seniors Have Sex Into 70s, 80s
BY MARILYNN MARCHIONE, AP Medical Writer
3 hours ago

An unprecedented study of sex and seniors finds that many older people
are surprisingly frisky _ willing to do, and talk about, intimate acts
that would make their grandchildren blush. That may be too much
information for some folks, but it comes from the most comprehensive
sex survey ever done among 57- to 85-year-olds in the United States.

Sex and interest in it do fall off when people are in their 70s, but
more than a quarter of those up to age 85 reported having sex in the
previous year. And the drop-off has a lot to do with health or lack of
a partner, especially for women, the survey found.

The federally funded study, done by respected scientists and published
in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, overturns some
stereotypical notions that physical pleasure is just a young person's
game.

&quot;Most people assume that people stop doing it after some vague age,&quot;
said sex researcher Edward Laumann of the University of Chicago.

However, more than half of those aged 57 to 75 said they gave or
received oral sex, as did about a third of 75- to 85-year-olds.

&quot;Bravo that the New England Journal of Medicine is publishing
something like that. It's about time,&quot; said Ruth Westheimer, better
known as sexpert Dr. Ruth, who has long counseled seniors on sex.

The survey involved two-hour face-to-face interviews with 3,005 men
and women around the country. Researchers also took blood, saliva and
other samples that will tell about hormone levels, sex-related
infections and other health issues in future reports. They even tested
how well seniors could see, taste, hear and smell _ things that affect
being able to have and enjoy sex.

Some results:

_Sex with a partner in the previous year was reported by 73 percent of
people ages 57 to 64; 53 percent of those ages 64 to 75, and 26
percent of people 75 to 85. Of those who were active, most said they
did it two to three times a month or more.

_Women at all ages were less likely to be sexually active than men.
But they also lacked partners; far more were widowed.

_People whose health was excellent or very good were nearly twice as
likely to be sexually active as those in poor or fair health.

_Half of people having sex reported at least one related problem. Most
common in men was erection trouble (37 percent); in women, low desire
(43 percent), vaginal dryness (39 percent) and inability to have an
orgasm (34 percent).

_One out of seven men used Viagra or other substances to improve sex.

_Only 22 percent of women and 38 percent of men had discussed sex with
a doctor since age 50.

The survey had a remarkable 75 percent response rate. Only 2 percent
to 7 percent did not answer questions about sexual activities or
problems, although a higher percentage declined to reveal how often
they masturbate.

Why do this research? Sex is an important indicator of health, said
Georgeanne Patmios of the National Institute on Aging, the study's
main funder.

Sexual problems can be a warning sign of diabetes, infections, cancer
or other health woes. Untreated sex issues can lead to depression and
social withdrawal, and people may even stop taking needed medications
because of sexual side effects, the researchers wrote.

Some of them did a landmark study of sexual habits in younger people a
decade ago, but little is known about X-rated behaviors beyond
Generation X.

&quot;This subject has been taboo for so long that many older people
haven't even talked to their spouses about their sexual problems, let
alone a physician,&quot; said the lead author, Dr. Stacy Tesser Lindau, a
University of Chicago gynecologist.

Many doctors are embarrassed to bring it up, and some may not know how
to treat sexual dysfunction, said Dr. Alison Moore, a geriatrics
specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who had no
role in the study.

&quot;Even among geriatricians, there can be an age bias that this is not
as big a deal as some of the other things they come into us for,&quot; like
heart problems or dementia, Moore said. &quot;It gets lost in the shuffle.&quot;

The National Opinion Research Center, a university-affiliated private
research firm, did the surveys in people's homes. Laumann, its
chairman, has received research support from Pfizer Inc., the maker of
Viagra.

Hundreds of questions were asked face to face; others, like the number
of lifetime sex partners and frequency of masturbation, were asked in
a questionnaire, and 84 percent of those were completed.

Most participants were married. But by the time they were 75 to 85,
only 37 percent of women had spouses compared to 71 percent of men.
Roughly 10 percent of those in the survey were black and more than 6
percent were Hispanic.

The proportion of each gender reporting giving and receiving oral sex
&quot;matched up perfectly,&quot; Lindau said. &quot;This gives us pretty good
reassurance that men and women are telling the same story.&quot;

Older people were generally sexually conservative. A small minority
had more than one partner, and very few said they paid for sex.

Researchers also used state-of-the-art technology and products donated
by several companies to test people's senses. Taste strips were used
to see if people could distinguish between various tastes (sour,
salty). Special devices were used to test the ability to smell certain
scents, including a suspected pheromone _ a smell thought to evoke
sexual responses.

Scents and tastes &quot;get under the skin to influence biology,&quot; and
scientists wanted to know whether these senses diminish as people age,
Lindau explained.

Niels Teunis, an anthropologist and researcher at the Institute of
Sexuality, Social Inequality, and Health at San Francisco State
University, said the survey bolsters the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; factor
seen in previous studies.

&quot;If you are doing it, you keep doing it. If you slack off in marriage
like when you're in your 40s, it's hard to pick it up when you are
older,&quot; he said.

Jack Menager, 83, and his wife, Elizabeth, 84, agree. The suburban Los
Angeles couple say they have had a good sex life for nearly 60 years.

&quot;It gives a person relief on any burdens or problems. It makes us
forget everything _ escape,&quot; he said, admitting that as physical
endurance wanes &quot;you have to work at it harder.&quot;

The couple takes twice daily walks, drinks wine in moderation and
talks a lot, said his wife.

&quot;I think it's important,&quot; she said of sex. &quot;It just makes you feel
close.&quot;

More men than women felt that way. Only 13 percent of men but 35
percent of women said sex was &quot;not at all important.&quot;

Menopause has a big effect on women, and the drop-off of estrogen
makes many of them less interested in sex, Dr. John Bancroft of the
Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at
Indiana University wrote in an accompanying editorial.

But menopause also means women no longer have to worry about getting
pregnant, and many have more time and feel freer after children are
gone, notes Westheimer, the sex adviser.

At age 79, she said, &quot;I don't ever answer personal questions&quot; about
sex. But she added, &quot;I certainly have a zest for life.&quot;

Very interesting, Donn, and quite reassuring in many ways.

Without revealing TMI, ... &lt;snort&gt; ... I have to admit I had always
heard that libido pretty much died after menopause.  But I've found
that I'm hor*ier since menopause than I have been since I was 25.  I
was worried about my mental condition until I found an article
somewhere that talks about &quot;menopausal zest&quot;, which described me to a
&quot;T&quot;.

At least I'm no longer worried about being a geriatric nymphomaniac,
LOL.

Seriously,  that's an interesting, thoughtful and useful article.
Thanks.
