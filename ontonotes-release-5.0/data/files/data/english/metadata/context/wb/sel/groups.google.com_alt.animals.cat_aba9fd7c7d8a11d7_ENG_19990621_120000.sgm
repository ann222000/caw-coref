Well.. I've started letting my kiddos outside. I am the most paranoid
cat owner :P I leave a window open so they can always get back in. The
window seems to be their favorite point of egress :P My backyard has an
eight foot privacy fence.. I've seen Starbuck go over but not Spooky.
They both have collars with little canister things (I've never seen
these in the US only here in the UK) that have a rolled up piece of
paper with their name, address, phone number and my name.. but I'm still
worried about it :P

They are years old.. spayed.. and when I first let them out I went out
with them.. now I just have the window open when I'm home so they can
come and go as they please.

Should I be worried? I know that if someone wants to take one of my
cats.. they'll take one. But.. realistically.. have people had problems
with letting their cats outside? Every cat I had while growing up was
an outside/inside cat and we never had problems with any of them aside
from a brawl that Hamlet got into :/

"/> Hi cari, I can't really comment on whether or not it is safe for you to let
your cats outside, however I do suggest two things. Firstly please try to
discourage you cat from going over the fence. The back yard is safe but god
knows what lurks on the other side and secondly please exchange the
canisters for either the round stamped tags or the little whiska's tags
which can be bought from Petsmart. Their web site should list the closest
one to you. The reason i say this is because there are many clueless people
out there who will not think to check these canisters should something
happen to your cat. My cat Rosie was run down and killed. She was still
wearing her collar from reports I have received. Not one person, not the
woman who phone the sanitation department, not the sanitation department
themselves who PICKED HER UP or the horrible little b*****d kids who stood
at the bus stop where she was found and kicked and poked her bothered to
undo the canister to see if there was a name and number inside.
Consequently she was taken away and I had no way of getting her back. I
could not bury her and this upsets me greatly. I changed her collar for the
canister because the last one annoyed her and she chewed it off. I now
deeply regret not giving her a new instantly visible nametag. Please do not
make the same mistake as I would hate for you too have to go through what i
did. (I live in the UK too BTW)

It may not be attractive but you could cat-proof that fence with an
extension of wire fence that tilts inward toward the yard about two to three
feet deep. I have seen it done on wire fences. If your privacy fence is
wooden, don't know how you would like it. Hazel

Thank you for the advice.. do you happen to know the web address of Petsmart? I
think the closest one to me is in Peterborough.. until the one here in
Huntingdon is completed...

Hiya Cari &amp; Paul!

Personally, we don't let our little treasures out of the house, unless
the'yre on a lead. Cassie's got quite used to her daily &quot;Walkies&quot;, and is
happy to stroll around the garden. We're still working on the &quot;Heel&quot; and
&quot;Canter&quot;.

One piece of advice I can give you. Do you have a busy road next to your
house. If so, some cat's can be quite oblivious of traffic, thinking that if
they collide with a car, then &quot;poor car&quot;. A quick method of road training
I've heard of is to buy a water pistol, seriously, stand on the kerbside
when your cats out, and if you see her even think of stepping in the road,
shoot the water at her. That will enforce a reation that stepping in the
road is bad.

Hope that helps!

Yours. Pont.

Thanks, Pont, for the advice! I do keep the cats from the front yard but I will
definitely keep the squirt gun in mind if I ever have a problem with it. :)
Spooky is normally content to curl up in a bush in the back yard.. and Starbuck
just roams the two yards on either side of us :)

Oh! Same problem with apartments. While terribly expensive, can you put up
your own wire fence inside the privacy fence? Or, while you hate to confine
them so much, you can buy large &quot;runs&quot; which are all enclosed with wiring.
They can see farther than they can go. Good luck. Hazel

I once heard that if you wait till the rush hour and then take the very
young kittens (while still there is no risk of them escaping) out to have
a look at a load of fast cars/buses/lorries going past a foot or so away,
then it can help.

Well, I have a problem with letting my cat, Charlie outside. We've had
outside cats before and a whole lot of them got killed by the busy road
in front of our house. Two have managed to survive; one of them, Bee,
learned that the road is bad after he watched his brother get killed by
a car... poor thing. We tried to scare our outdoor cats by honking if we
found them walking in the road while we were driving down the street ...
but it didn't seem to work, some got killed by the road anyway.

I let Charlie outside ONLY if I'm with him and I have a close eye on
him. He doesn't run away, thank God, he just walks really slow, sniffing
everything and taking in the plants and flowers! I would be in a panic
if I left him outside by himself since he's been an indoor cat his whole
life.

I really don't know the answer to how to get kitties accustomed to going
outside by themselves and being careful. There's invisible fencing for
dogs but for cats? I don't think they have that. I wish I knew the
answers myself since I would love to let Charlie roam around and have
fun by himself but I'm too paranoid and scared to let that happen!

you said:
&quot;I'm afraid if he learns that &quot;water=bad&quot; he'll become even more fussy
when I have to bathe him. He's squirmy and whiny enough already when
he's being washed. What can I do?&quot;

They hate water no matter what so don't worry about it! ALL cats are
going to hate you for a little while after a bath whether you regularly
squirt them with a water pistol/sprayer or not. It doesn't make much of
a difference. Water is the cat's enemy!

I like the idea of squirting the cat with a water gun to keep it away from
certain areas, (I too am trying to keep my little Beau off the kitchen
countertops) but I'm afraid if he learns that &quot;water=bad&quot; he'll become even
more fussy when I have to bathe him. He's squirmy and whiny enough already

Well, I have two cats, a 9 year old Siamese, and a 1 year old Himalayan,
and neither of them have ever been allowed outside, except when they were
being held. They've never roamed around out there on their own.
Basically, we choose to keep them indoors because 1)they stay much cleaner
and have no dirt or flea problems, and 2)no worries about getting in cat
fights or being hit by cars or stolen. Also, if they remain indoors, you
can have their front paws declawed, if they're tearing up your house. If
they're outdoor cats though, and happen to enjoy clawing through your home,
you're out of luck. Just my take on the indoor/outdoor discussion.

Good to hear that you FINALLY learned that it is insanity to let cats
outside, except on a leash or in a fully enclosed cat run. In an instant
they can spook and run into that quiet street that just happened, at that
moment in time, to have a vehicle coming down the street. Too bad so many
cats had to die before you finally caught on.

Murphy, I should have simply e-mailed you, instead of posting to the whole
newsgroup, as you did to me, but anyway:
For one thing, my parents are the ones who chose to &quot;mutilate&quot; the cats, as
both of them clawed our furniture horribly. Second, as I said, we don't
let my cats outside, otherwise we wouldn't have them declawed, as they
would need protection. Nearly everyone I know with a housecat has it
declawed. I can't believe some people (like you) think it's such a
horrible thing to declaw the front paws only of an indoor cat. Our cats
have always been happy, healthy, friendly, and loving. I highly doubt
their declawing did anything to their egos or &quot;self-image&quot; as I've seen
some people say. So....
Is there anyone else here who has chosen to declaw their cat? Did you see
any change in its personality after declawing? I'd like to know. Thank
you.

Tara, Why do you have to bathe him? Doesn't he groom himself (lick every
inch of his fur for 45 min, curled up in a sunny patch under the skylight,
before napping until the next meal)? Aahh, the stress-free life-style of

Tara, I agree. It's a cold cruel world out there. My babies are indoor
cats just for that reason.
I remember as a kid letting our cats in and out at will &amp; life was pretty
safe back then, so it seemed. But now there are just too many dangers
lurking.
I live in a rural setting, but the neighbors let their dogs run wild. We
have a strain of cat lukkemia in our area, much more prominent than it used
to be, &amp; lots of skunks, possums, raccoons (possible rabbis).
Call me an over-protective mother, but they are happy peering through the
open windows &amp; not experiencing what the &quot;outside&quot; world has to offer.

&gt;Well, I have two cats, a 9 year old Siamese, and a 1 year old Himalayan,
&gt;and neither of them have ever been allowed outside, except when they were
&gt;being held. They've never roamed around out there on their own.
&gt;Basically, we choose to keep them indoors because 1)they stay much cleaner
&gt;and have no dirt or flea problems, and 2)no worries about getting in cat
&gt;fights or being hit by cars or stolen. Also, if they remain indoors, you
&gt;can have their front paws declawed, if they're tearing up your house. If
&gt;they're outdoor cats though, and happen to enjoy clawing through your home,
&gt;you're out of luck. Just my take on the indoor/outdoor discussion.

I know it is illegal here in the UK, Tara.. and if I were back in the states
and had problems with my cats clawing furniture.. I would definitely consider
declawing. As it is now I have a catnip covered scratching post and I've never

Hi Carol. Well, I have to bathe him because of the &quot;poop problem.&quot; I've
discussed it here before. He's a himalayan and often gets large chunks of
poop stuck to his rear end that have to be washed off in the sink. Pulling
them off just doesn't work. His whole bottom half usually has to be
immersed in water and washed with cat shampoo and conditioner. Quite a
pain, but I love him anyway. :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; declawed. I can't believe some people (like you) think it's such a
&gt; horrible thing to declaw the front paws only of an indoor cat. Our cats
&gt; have always been happy, healthy, friendly, and loving. I highly doubt
&gt; their declawing did anything to their egos or &quot;self-image&quot; as I've seen
&gt; some people say. So....

"/> The problem I have with declawing is not solely the &quot;self image&quot; damage.
Although it is known to happen, I don't feel it is the worst part of a
declaw. The *worst* part is the actual procedure. Do you know what the
procedure involves? What, do you think they just clip off the claw part?
Nope, try again. It is the equivalent of chopping off the last joint of all
your fingers. Does that sound like something worth doing just because your
precious furniture is in &quot;danger&quot;? Go to  http://www.lisaviolet.com  for a
vet techs description of what declawing actually is. This is the best site
I've seen. Maybe then you will understand why so many people feel so
strongly against this operation. So many people that in fact 15 countries
have outlawed the barbaric procedure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there anyone else here who has chosen to declaw their cat? Did you see
&gt; any change in its personality after declawing? I'd like to know. Thank
&gt; you.

"/> You can also find stories about people who have declawed, and how their cats
suffered for it, at the above URL. I suggest you check it out. But don't

&gt;Good to hear that you FINALLY learned that it is insanity to let cats
&gt;outside, except on a leash or in a fully enclosed cat run. In an

that
&gt;moment in time, to have a vehicle coming down the street. Too bad so
many
&gt;cats had to die before you finally caught on.

"/> I just wanted to make it clear to all that my outside cats were STRAYS
that came around and we never bought or adopted them. It took a long
time to tame each one and if we could tame them enough to have them live
in the house, we would but the outdoors is all they know and are
accustomed to. One of them, &quot;Mommy Cat,&quot; is a cat we CANNOT catch. If we
could, we'd take to her to the vet to get her spayed but, unfortunately,
she keeps having kittens every year and some get killed before we can
get a chance to tame them and give them away. It's sad but.... at least
Mommy Cat didn't have any kittens this year!

I just don't appreciate you thinking that I just LET them get killed. We
tried everything we could to get these wild cats to stay out of the
road. Our Tonkinese that we adopted is an indoor cat and, since he's the
only one who is truly tame, I will not let him run around outside just
to get killed by the road.

No vet in the UK will declaw a cat as it viewed by the BVA as a barbaric practice.
and the vet can run the risk of being struck-off. Any vet who wishes to declaw a
cat for medical reasons must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they have
exhausted all other methods and that it is the _only_ option left. To this end
there has only be one declawing of a cat in the UK is something like 13 years
(sorry I can't remember the exact stat) Speak to any vet here and they will tell
you that. There has been no need to legislate against it as the vetenary service
has done such a good job of iradicating the procedure and educating its vets.

procedure on a *very* large cat, so large that the biggest legal dose of
anaesthetic wasn't enough to put the cat out. The vet did the operation
anyway. Really traumatized my husband, and no doubt the cat as well.

There are silicone claw caps available; they glue on with super glue and last at
least 6 weeks. We put them on Billion's back feet when his allergies got really
bad, so he couldn't hurt himself, but most people use them as an alternative to
front-paw declawing.

My Billion comes and goes, though I bring him in at night. He was a Chicago street
cat when I found him, and definitely knows about cars -- and we live in the country
now. I tried to make him into an indoor cat when I first found him -- kept him in
for 6 months solid. He spent much of that time running the length of three rooms at
top speed, leaping up on a window sill, and bashing the top of his head into the
window, over and over and over again, for hours. Finally figured that A) he was
just too miserable, and B) the risk of brain damage was higher than the risk of cars
or infectious disease.

Figured the country would be safer -- and what should happen but that he's developed
severe allergies to every thing that grows here -- and the dust mites in the house,
too. Bummer.

Don't be so bloody ridiculous. When you posted your email address to

post your email address.

For anyone who's interested by the way, the &quot;offensive&quot; email was simply
my courtesy copy of the reply I posted here to this fruitcake asking
him/her to provide facts and figures for his/her ludicrous statement.

Here it is again:

&quot;Can you please name here the &quot;numerous&quot; humane groups you're referring
to with direct quotes from the studies they cite and the exact
statistics concerned. As yet none of the people who continually quote
numbers like this has been able to cite any specific reference.

On the other hand, many people have cited the following:

&quot;In &quot;Catnip&quot;, a newsletter from Tufts (a well-known university in the US
with a good veterinary school), it was stated that the average lifespan
of an exclusively indoor cat is about 12-15 years, whereas that of an
owned indoor/outdoor cat is 10-12 years in the US.

There are now a number of examples of feral cats in managed colonies
(these cats receive some veterinary care, are neutered and are regularly
fed, but live primarily outdoors) that are relatively old. Specifically,
there are now 92 colonies with cats ranging from 4-8 years of age, and
31 with cats over 9 years of age in the US, according to Alley Cat
Allies, an organization dedicated to humane management of feral cats in
the US.&quot;

If you're unable to back up your statement with hard facts I'd suggest
you don't make claims you can't substantiate.&quot;

Yep, *deeply* offensive as I'm sure you'll all agree.

water

It has been quite awhile since I've been part of this newsgroup, but this
discussion about declawing I see, still lives on.

I have two cats, both females, both strictly indoor and they have their claws
(first digits!) intact. It took alot of patience with training them, alot of
catnip and weekly trimmings. Declawing, (I am told, I haven't researched it)
by the way, in the UK is illegal and viewed as inhumane.

rescue for almost 40 years, all over the country, and the first time she
heard of declawing was when I told her what I'd discovered on the

that he has never, ever had a single client even mention it and that he
has never known any other vet who's been asked about it either.

There is no such thing as declawing in the UK and amputating a cat's

have come across the only landlord in the country who's heard of
declawing? Bullshit. You're clearly someone who'll say anything just

"/> In many countries, routine declawing is either illegal or so socially
shunned it just isn't done. It is inhumane and unnecessary. It is the
&quot;quick fix&quot; for many to lazy or simply ignorant of the alternatives,
such as trimming claws or training the cat to use a scratching post.

To give you an example, here in the UK, the British Veterinary
Association views routine decalwing (declawing for non-medical
reasons) as &quot;unnecesary abuse&quot; - I agree with them. here in the UK,
cats are the number one choice of family pet - without having to
resort to declawing them.

I suggest you take the time to look at some of the many websites on
declawing to learn the facts about it. It is amputation of the claw
*and the bone to which the claw is attached*. It is a totally
unnecessary procedure to do unless there is a medical reason, such as
injury to the paw where there is no alternative to amputation.

Here's a couple of sites for you to start of at...

&gt;Well it isn't actually illegal here in the UK it is simply an outlawed procedure.
&gt;No vet in the UK will declaw a cat as it viewed by the BVA as a barbaric practice.
&gt;and the vet can run the risk of being struck-off. Any vet who wishes to declaw a
&gt;cat for medical reasons must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they have
&gt;exhausted all other methods and that it is the _only_ option left. To this end
&gt;there has only be one declawing of a cat in the UK is something like 13 years
&gt;(sorry I can't remember the exact stat) Speak to any vet here and they will tell
&gt;you that. There has been no need to legislate against it as the vetenary service
&gt;has done such a good job of iradicating the procedure and educating its vets.

"/> Having listened to the RSPCA's top bod on the radio, he confirmed that
in the UK, what is actually illegal is &quot;causing unnecessary suffering&quot;
to an animal. Hence, declawing for a non-medical reason should fall
under that umbrella as the British Veterinary Association view routine
declawing as &quot;unnecessary mutilation&quot; There is not a specific statute
that reads &quot;declawing is illegal&quot;, but what is covered is the
unnecessary suffering as described above. This is how people can and
are taken to court for neglecting and abusing animals.

As an aside, I see that a previous Crufts champion owner has recently
been bnanned from keeping all animals (except horses) as a result of a
successful prosecution for abuse of various animals kept at his/her
home.

Chicago (no busses, only local traffic) and let him go in and out. Now live in
the country, where he does the same. He's now pushing 15, and aside from some
allergies (and the thing he's most allergic to is dust mites -- in the house),
he's in great shape. Of course he gets his shots regularly.

If I were getting a new kitten, I'd likely keep it in. But quality of life is
an issue, too, and Billion, having spent the first few months of his life out,
was utterly miserable being kept in. I'm his mom, not his owner, and I don't

I don't agree with that. I have persians that I bathe weekly. They have
their claws... all of them. You need to stop making excuses and learn how
to handle a cat better instead of sending it to the vet to be mutilated for
your own comfort and the sake of your furniture. If you can't do that you
shouldn't have cats at all. If you can't bath the cat by yourself, get
someone to assist, but don't lop of the tips of it's toes to make it easier
for you.

And just exactly why do you need to give this cat butt baths? If he has a
bowel problem, you should be concentrating on solving that problem instead
of removing the tips of his toes. A healthy cat does not need to have it's
rearend bathed on a regular basis. Even a persian that has extremely long
hair around that area of it's body.

I think I disagree.. cats do what they want most of the time.. and yes..
they know what you want or don't want them to do.. but when you are not
there 8 hrs of the day (because some of us have to work).. they don't
follow the rules..

We have 4 wonderful cats (1 himalyan, 1 white persian, and 1 gray and
black tabby and one with six toes in front and is part blue point and part
whatever) ... All four of our girls are spaded and declawed.. they don't
seem to mind at all.. and it is MUCH easier because we don't have to worry
about furniture, or ourselves getting scratched up .. they are perfectly
happy and it wasn't an unpleasant procedure at all..

I think it is more inhumane to leave an indoor cat with all it's claws..
because then you are scolding it a lot and I would rather spend my time
cuddling not scolding.

&gt; Even if a cat is indoors only - that is *no* excuse to have it
&gt; declawed. It is an incredibly inhumane thing to do - for owner
&gt; convenience. More humane methods to eliminate inappropriate scratching
&gt; exist - trimming claws, training the cat to use a scratching post....

thanks for sticking up for the de-clawing.. I think it is in-humane to
leave the claws on.. all four of my cats are declawed (they never go
outside)..
sounds like some weird people on the cat forum.. two of my cats were
declawed when i got them.. and the other two our vet did.. and it was NOT
a big deal.. the cats didn't mind at all.

&gt;&gt; I suggest you take the time to look at some of the many websites on
&gt;&gt; declawing to learn the facts about it. It is amputation of the claw
&gt;&gt; *and the bone to which the claw is attached*. It is a totally
&gt;&gt; unnecessary procedure to do unless there is a medical reason, such as
&gt;&gt; injury to the paw where there is no alternative to amputation.

&gt;&gt; Here's a couple of sites for you to start of at...

are spayed and neutered. All the cats have all of their claws.

Our furniture isn't in shambles, ripped, with big swaths of material
hanging down and we aren't walking around dripping blood, as some people
would have others believe. We aren't the walking wounded. As I'm sure
the people outside of North America would tell you. (Did you know that
this surgery is mostly contained right here on our continent, as most of
the other countries consider it a form of animal abuse?)

Cats can be trained. Like you, we don't worry about the furniture when
we aren't around. And to be honest, if we *were* worried about the cats
hurting our furniture while we wasn't around, we would cover the
furniture, which is temporary. It can always be uncovered. What we
*won't* do is to permanently mutilate our cats with a surgery that is
not beneficial to the cat, but for the owner, except in the rarest
cases.

Have to completely agree with Murphy on this one. Declawing is so
unheard of in the UK, that there was even an article in The Times
about it, when a reporter had a visit to the States and she came
across declawing for the first time. It appalled her so much that on
her return to the UK, she wrote an article on it and how awful it is
that someone would amputate part of a cat's paw for owner convenience.
It completely shocked her.

I had not heard of declawing at all until I found out about it via the
internet. At first, I thought it was merely trimming a cat's claws.
Not so, when I looked into it some more. It is a truly awful thing to
do to an animal for a non-medical reason - inhumane and entirely
unnecessary. Cats are the most popular choice of pet in the UK - and
we don't declaw for non-medical reasons and we are just as proud of
our homes and possessions as anyone else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;What utter garbage. Declawing does not exist in any shape or form in
&gt;the UK. It never has. It has never been done and 99% of the population
&gt;has never heard of it. We have a close friends who's worked in cat
&gt;rescue for almost 40 years, all over the country, and the first time she
&gt;heard of declawing was when I told her what I'd discovered on the
&gt;internet. Our vet, who's been practising for over 30 years tells me
&gt;that he has never, ever had a single client even mention it and that he
&gt;has never known any other vet who's been asked about it either.

&gt;There is no such thing as declawing in the UK and amputating a cat's
&gt;toes is not something that would just spring to mind. Yet you claim to
&gt;have come across the only landlord in the country who's heard of
&gt;declawing? Bullshit. You're clearly someone who'll say anything just

furniture. I said that if they're tearing up your entire house, then that
is a problem, and yes if they aren't being trained to scratch a post then
maybe declawing should be looked into. Otherwise, some impatient people
are just going to toss the cat off to a shelter somewhere, where it might
not even find a good home. And don't think that doesn't happen. Lots of
people just get rid of their animals if they dislike some aspect of their

&gt;Well, we have 19 cats and we've modified our home for the cats, not the
&gt;cats for our home. They did *us* a favor by coming into our lives, we
&gt;don't look at ourselves as noble for having given them a home. (I'm sure
&gt;you've heard people say about taking in cats..&quot;well, they're lucky to
&gt;have a home at all&quot;....we're NOT those people.) *We* are the ones that
&gt;have benefited from *their* presence in our lives. All of our animals
&gt;are spayed and neutered. All the cats have all of their claws.

&gt;Our furniture isn't in shambles, ripped, with big swaths of material
&gt;hanging down and we aren't walking around dripping blood, as some people
&gt;would have others believe. We aren't the walking wounded. As I'm sure
&gt;the people outside of North America would tell you. (Did you know that
&gt;this surgery is mostly contained right here on our continent, as most of
&gt;the other countries consider it a form of animal abuse?)

&gt;Cats can be trained. Like you, we don't worry about the furniture when
&gt;we aren't around. And to be honest, if we *were* worried about the cats
&gt;hurting our furniture while we wasn't around, we would cover the
&gt;furniture, which is temporary. It can always be uncovered. What we
&gt;*won't* do is to permanently mutilate our cats with a surgery that is
&gt;not beneficial to the cat, but for the owner, except in the rarest
&gt;cases.

&gt;Have a nice day. :)

Hey all,

I'd like to point out, that #1, declawing does not gaurantee that a cat will
have a permanent home. It does not guarantee that he will forever be an only
'indoor' cat. Having had no less that 13 cats as part of my life (not all
at once), and recieved all of them either from shelters, or off the street,
or as unwanted givaways, I'd like to say that neither myself nor my family
has ever had a cat declawed. All were spayed/neutered as soon as we recieved
them into our home. All of our cats have been indoor/outdoor cats. Some
have lived to be very old, some have not. Currently, my parents have just
taken in an unwanted orange cat who had been declawed by his previous owner.
That owner got rid of him even after declawing due to 'behavior problems'
(he liked to chew up electrical cables, mouse cords, phone cords, etc). Now
this poor cat is living in a house with 3 other cats that have claws. He
gets his poor butt kicked on a daily basis. I'm sure that this cat finds
his lack of defence a 'big deal' to quote the person below. The JERK that
owned him previously, removed from him his only means of defense and then
got rid of him, because he still did not conform to that person's lifestyle.
Funny, my family has not had any difficulty with his supposed 'behavior
problem'.

What is my point? My point is that you bring an animal into your home
because you love them as they are. You love them for the way that god or
evolution or selective breeding made them. You do not remove thier basic
characteristics because they may inconvience you. You live with the
drawbacks like pet hair, fleas, occasional scratches and nips to you or your
small children (yes, I got scratched by my first cat alot when I was 3. But
the cat succeeded in teaching me the right way to treat a cat.) When you
bring a pet home to live with you, you have signed a morally binding
contract to care for that animal for the rest of it's natural life to the
best of your ability. You do not buy in to quick fixes like declawing in
the hopes that it will cure the symptoms of a problem, rather than the
cause. You live with the animal in all of it's evolutionary glory.

You love your cat because of it's independence, it's remarkable resilience,
and it's perfection as a predator. Evolution, or god, designed her that way.

You love your dog for his loyalty, and obedience. He is a pack animal,
evolution or god (depending on your belief system) designed him that way. He
needs your attention, affection, and leadership as top dog of the pack. If
you don't like it, or can't give him the attention and training he deserves,
don't own one.

You love your ferret for his playfullness and his intelligence. You live
with his tenacity and singleminded determination to get into places where he
doesn't belong. These are intrensic traits of ferrets. If you don't like
it, don't bring one into your home.

thanks for sticking up for the de-clawing.. I think it is in-humane to
leave the claws on.. all four of my cats are declawed (they never go
outside)..
sounds like some weird people on the cat forum.. two of my cats were
declawed when i got them.. and the other two our vet did.. and it was NOT
a big deal.. the cats didn't mind at all.

Since Adrian's email address is apparently invalid, I apologize to the rest
of the newsgroup for this, but I have the need to say this to Adrian:
Excuse me. Like I've said before, I was NOT the one who chose to declaw my
cats! Can't anyone get that through their head? All my initial argument
was was that my cats were friendly, happy, and healthy cats, so I doubted
declawing altered their personalities. And I said that if an owner is
being scratched up all the time or their cat just is not responding to a
scratching post, etc, then declawing is an option so at least the cat isn't
always being scolded or being taken to a shelter,etc. I've never *abused*
a cat, as you say. I even stated that if I am to ever own any cats, I may
not declaw them. As it is, I probably won't be owning any for a very long
time. Which probably makes you very happy. Now shut up about my *abusing*
animals, since that's a bunch of crap.

Water pistols don't always work, because of rare cats who love water.

My mother had a cat who would jump in the bathtub with her and swim
around. He LOVED bubble baths.

"/> I've discussed Beau's &quot;poop problem&quot; many times on here before. He simply
chooses not to cover up his doodles after he uses the litterbox, and
occasionally steps in some of it, or gets it stuck to his rear end, due to
his very long hair. And he always seems to get on the counters when this
happens. It's not very pleasant.

isn't allowed (British veterinary Asociation views it as &quot;unnecessary
mutilation for an example ) any vet who will declaw for owner
convenience *is* pretty much a &quot;horrible bastard&quot;. Thankfully there is
a growing veterinary opinion in North America that sees routine
declawing for what it is and an ethical vet won't perform it for a
non-medical reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Anyway, apparently I share a different view on the animal world here. I
&gt;love cats quite a bit. I don't think they should be abused, nor should
&gt;any other animals, but I guess the declawing issue strikes a different
&gt;chord with me. Call me a hypocrite if you want. But really...maybe some
&gt;of you are indirectly abusing other animals...do you ever wear wool
&gt;sweaters? Shearing sheep could be considered abuse.

"/> Please then get to understand about &quot;shedding&quot; of coats in the summer.
In shearing a sheep, it is not harmed or permanently maimed. A coat
grows back on to the sheep. Indeed, a sheep unshorn in hot summer
months *will suffer* from too much heat. Totally different to
declawing a cat where the claw and the bone it is attached to is
*amputated* - no growing back - ever. Declawing is not regular nail
trimming, it is more akin to amputating the ends of your finger down
to the knuckle - quite a different kettle of fish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Hair is for protection
&gt;and warmth and they have it shaved off. Some people won't drink milk b/c
&gt;they feel that being milked is no picnic for the cows. Of course, those
&gt;are the die-hard vegetarians. Anyway, the examples are a little off track
&gt;of the cat thing, but just stating that when it comes to animals, people
&gt;have greatly differing views of what's right and what's wrong. I'm done
&gt;with this discussion.

"/> Absolutely - the examples you give bear no relation to the permanent
amputation of part of a paw that declawing is, unlike the items you
metion which do not mutilate the animals in question.

"/> Sorry, but you are completely off base with this one. Why on earth
should it be declaw or scold?? Why should it be decalw or scars and
scratches? It isn't.

Here in the UK, routine declawing is not allowed. Cats come with claws
unless there's some injury to the paw where there is no alternative to
amputation - that's what declawing is. Do you think we are a nation
covered in scratches and scars from years of untold rampaging cats?
Of course not. Do you think it is impossible to live in a home with
nice possessions and have a cat with claws? Of course it isn't.

What it does do, is take some time to train a cat not to scratch
inappropriately, some time which you have made clear you aren't
prepared to take, after all, it's much &quot;easier&quot; to have them declawed
- easier for *you* not the cat. You took the quick fix and had part of
your cat's paws amputated for your convenience. Pretty much seems an
inhumane and uncaring decision to me.

We often do trim him there, and that works pretty well. But he still
occasionally gets a piece stuck anyway. I guess that just comes with
having a long haired cat.

I just heard today that anything citrus can keep a cat away from certain

Gee..too bad trimming the fur on his rear end isn't a perfect solution. It
helps, but it doesn't completely eliminate the problem. Only if we shaved
his butt would it probably stop, and we don't want him walking around

Tara,

I've not see previous posting that mentioned it since I've only been on this
list a short while.

All of my cats are persians and himalayans, so they all have long hair.
The hair is especially long on the ones I show. I've never had much problem
with them getting poop all over their rear end unless they are having
problems with diarrea for some reason. Once they are past the kitten stage
they tend to keep themselves especially clean down there. I've had my long
hairs for 7 years and not run into the problem you have with Beau.

Well I'm happy that you do not have any problems with your cats. But
what's your point? Not all cats are the same. And Beau is a very
meticulous little cat. But it's difficult for him to dislodge a chunk all
by himself. Somehow pieces sometimes just tend to get stuck there. Haven't
you heard of &quot;dinkleberries?&quot; Many dogs have the same problem, even if
they have short hair. Also, our vet has confirmed that Beau is just as
healthy as can be. No bowel disorders.

"/> Well, I think comparing a restaurant to a home kitchen is comparing
apples to oranges. And here in California, you *can't* sell food on a
commercial basis that's made in the home. There are codes to be
followed.

If I were to cook something that made us sick, I'm sure nobody is going
to close us down. I'm certainly not going to sue me and neither will my
husband. I'm responsible in my home. When I'm in a restaurant, they
have a code for a reason. Not to make the public sick.

I also don't have signs up in my bathroom to wash my hands when I've
finished my business, nor is there a sign on the front door stating No
shirt, No shoes, No service.

Oh, and by the way, I don't think I called anybody anal, I said I
wasn't. Whatever inference is taken from that is totally up to the
reader and I'm not responsible for what others read into what I say.

And that's my opinion and you have your opinion.

And opinions are like buttholes. Everybody has one.

street and a side street. Frisko, only seems to stay on the side street, or
in the woods. My other three cats Charlie, Casey, And Bubba only go out on
my porch, and won't even try to go down stairs to the street.
I think that it is because they stayed in for so long that they are
afraid. Frisko is young and wants to be out. I think it's only natural for
him to go out, whether I like it or not.
After all he's a cat. Don't get me wrong I Love him dearly, But try keeping
a cat in that WANTS to go out. It's very difficult, but it's where he's the
happiest.

If you had children and they kicked and screamed to be allowed to go out
and play outside, or for candies, would you fall over and give them what
THEY wanted, even though it wasn't best...just so they would stop fussing?
Unfortunately, there are all too many parents just like that, these days.

There's a little difference between a cat and a child. My cat has ripped
curtains and my screen door.

I have been a child care provider for 6 years. and I don't let my kids have
anything they want. Although I understand what you are saying.

When we got Frisko he was about 6 months old, and was used to being outside,
living on a farm. So it is difficult to keep him in. I do worry about him
though.

Personally, I am not a fan of letting cats roam freely outside. Mine go out
only on a harness and leash. When I was growing up, we had a male cat who
was allowed outside. He got into a fight and disappeared for a couple of
days and when he came back, he had a severely abscessed tail. He almost
lost his tail.

The second cat that we had was allowed outside. She was let out one Sunday
morning and did not come back in when we called her before we went to
church. Apparently, she got cold and when she couldn't get back inside, she
climbed up inside the fanbelt of the neighbors Corvette to get warm. They
came out and started the car not knowing that she was there. She survived,
but was very badly hurt, and was always afraid to be outside after that.

My sister Katie's first cat was hit a killed by a car about a month after
she got it.

My sister Sarah accidently backed over my sister Elizabeth's cat when she
was learning how to drive. The cat survived, but he broke his leg and had
to wear a kitty cast.

When you think of all of the hazards that can befall a cat outside-injury,
disease, cruelty at the hands of other humans, I personally would not allow
any cat that under my care outside except on a harness or leash. We leash
trained ours very early, and we use those very long retractable leashes for
dogs, so that they have plenty of room to roam.

We pay lots of attention to them and play with them a lot when we are home.
We have provided lots of perches and toys and comfy places to snuggle and
bird feeders outside the windows to keep them entertained when we are not
there.

They really have expressed no desire to go out at times other than when we
take them.

I know that I will probably be criticized by some people for feeling this
way, but I feel that I am responsible for keeping them safe. (Yes, yes, I
know everything has risks, but some are avoidable). We live in an apartment
in an urban area, and there is too much traffic and too many people around
and too many stray cats and dogs for it to be safe for them to roam.
(Before anyone flames me to having cats in an area where they can't roam,
both of our cats were rescued from the local humane society shelter, so the
alternative to them being inside cats wasn't very desireable, either).
Also, one of my cats is blind due to congenital juvenile cataracts, so she
couldn't be allowed to roam, anyway, no matter where she lived or who she
lived with.

Just my two cents worth

&gt;worried about it :P

&gt;They are years old.. spayed.. and when I first let them out I went out
&gt;with them.. now I just have the window open when I'm home so they can
&gt;come and go as they please.

&gt;Should I be worried? I know that if someone wants to take one of my
&gt;cats.. they'll take one. But.. realistically.. have people had problems
&gt;with letting their cats outside? Every cat I had while growing up was
&gt;an outside/inside cat and we never had problems with any of them aside

Tara,

We had a struggle trying to teach our cats to stay of the table and
countertops, too, until I got the idea from something I read to try using
balloons. The idea with cats, is that the &quot;punishment&quot; or consequence has
to be immediate, and consistent. My cat got up on the table twice after we
put the balloons on it and each time they popped. After two times, the
message got across. We haven't' caught her on the table since.

&gt;&gt; She soon developed a habit of watching me take showers. Her little head

celebration, etc, and the cats get curious about them. Sometimes they get
tangled up in the ribbons, which is obviously not very safe for them, but
it scares them. However, I think they always forget, because every time we
have more balloons, they go after them anyway. :) But thanks, maybe it'll
be different if I try balloons on the counter...

&gt; Tara,

&gt; We had a struggle trying to teach our cats to stay of the table and
&gt; countertops, too, until I got the idea from something I read to try using
&gt; balloons. The idea with cats, is that the &quot;punishment&quot; or consequence
has
&gt; to be immediate, and consistent. My cat got up on the table twice after
we
&gt; put the balloons on it and each time they popped. After two times, the
&gt; message got across. We haven't' caught her on the table since.

I agree that there can be a lot of dangers for a cat loose out of doors.
However, I let my cat, C.J., do it anyway. I live in a townhouse
development where the traffic is kept to a minimum and the speeds are less
than 10 kmph. (Actually, because of the children, we are trying to keep the
traffic speeds to less than 5 kmph). I don't allow my cat to go out of
doors in the winter just in case he does try to find a warm spot in a car.
If I do let him out, I watch him closely. C.J. is afraid of people but has
harassed a boxer dog. He still tries to push his weight around with other
cats but he is 10 years old and most of the others are a lot younger than
that. Every now and then I have to rescue him from a fight. When you
become the owner of a cat you become its mother. What I am saying is that
if you let you cat outside, watch it and take care of it.

&gt; Personally, I am not a fan of letting cats roam freely outside. Mine go
out
&gt; only on a harness and leash. When I was growing up, we had a male cat who
&gt; was allowed outside. He got into a fight and disappeared for a couple of
&gt; days and when he came back, he had a severely abscessed tail. He almost
&gt; lost his tail.

&gt; The second cat that we had was allowed outside. She was let out one
Sunday
&gt; morning and did not come back in when we called her before we went to
&gt; church. Apparently, she got cold and when she couldn't get back inside,
she
&gt; climbed up inside the fanbelt of the neighbors Corvette to get warm. They
&gt; came out and started the car not knowing that she was there. She
survived,
&gt; but was very badly hurt, and was always afraid to be outside after that.

&gt; My sister Katie's first cat was hit a killed by a car about a month after
&gt; she got it.

&gt; My sister Sarah accidently backed over my sister Elizabeth's cat when she
&gt; was learning how to drive. The cat survived, but he broke his leg and had
&gt; to wear a kitty cast.

&gt; When you think of all of the hazards that can befall a cat outside-injury,
&gt; disease, cruelty at the hands of other humans, I personally would not
allow
&gt; any cat that under my care outside except on a harness or leash. We leash
&gt; trained ours very early, and we use those very long retractable leashes
for
&gt; dogs, so that they have plenty of room to roam.

&gt; We pay lots of attention to them and play with them a lot when we are
home.
&gt; We have provided lots of perches and toys and comfy places to snuggle and
&gt; bird feeders outside the windows to keep them entertained when we are not
&gt; there.

&gt; They really have expressed no desire to go out at times other than when we
&gt; take them.

&gt; I know that I will probably be criticized by some people for feeling this
&gt; way, but I feel that I am responsible for keeping them safe. (Yes, yes, I
&gt; know everything has risks, but some are avoidable). We live in an
apartment
&gt; in an urban area, and there is too much traffic and too many people around
&gt; and too many stray cats and dogs for it to be safe for them to roam.
&gt; (Before anyone flames me to having cats in an area where they can't roam,
&gt; both of our cats were rescued from the local humane society shelter, so
the
&gt; alternative to them being inside cats wasn't very desireable, either).
&gt; Also, one of my cats is blind due to congenital juvenile cataracts, so she
&gt; couldn't be allowed to roam, anyway, no matter where she lived or who she
&gt; lived with.

&gt; Just my two cents worth

&gt;&gt;Well.. I've started letting my kiddos outside. I am the most paranoid
&gt;&gt;cat owner :P I leave a window open so they can always get back in. The
&gt;&gt;window seems to be their favorite point of egress :P My backyard has an
&gt;&gt;eight foot privacy fence.. I've seen Starbuck go over but not Spooky.
&gt;&gt;They both have collars with little canister things (I've never seen
&gt;&gt;these in the US only here in the UK) that have a rolled up piece of
&gt;&gt;paper with their name, address, phone number and my name.. but I'm still
&gt;&gt;worried about it :P

&gt;&gt;They are years old.. spayed.. and when I first let them out I went out
&gt;&gt;with them.. now I just have the window open when I'm home so they can
&gt;&gt;come and go as they please.

&gt;&gt;Should I be worried? I know that if someone wants to take one of my
&gt;&gt;cats.. they'll take one. But.. realistically.. have people had problems
&gt;&gt;with letting their cats outside? Every cat I had while growing up was
&gt;&gt;an outside/inside cat and we never had problems with any of them aside
&gt;&gt;from a brawl that Hamlet got into :/

Don't spray the cat near the face and it won't get in it's eyes. Who sprays
cats in the face anyway! That is good advice the vet gave you.

I've used aluminum foil to line sills, counters and tops of the backs of
chairs where I didn't want the cat. After the first few times of jumping on
top of it, she didn't like the sound or the feel and quit trying even after
the foil had been removed. It's also something that's easy to remove if you
have company over.

&gt;&gt;I like the idea of squirting the cat with a water gun to keep it away from
&gt;&gt;certain areas, (I too am trying to keep my little Beau off the kitchen
&gt;&gt;countertops) but I'm afraid if he learns that &quot;water=bad&quot; he'll become
even
&gt;&gt;more fussy when I have to bathe him. He's squirmy and whiny enough
already
&gt;&gt;when he's being washed. What can I do?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking of water training...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had to train my little darling to stay off the kitchen counter tops.
I
&gt;&gt;&gt; used a little spray bottle mister for plants. She soon associated water
&gt;&gt;&gt; with being BAD.

&gt;&gt;&gt; She soon developed a habit of watching me take showers. Her little head
&gt;&gt;&gt; would turn to the side, as if in a state of awe &amp; wonder (couldn't be
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sight of a fat lady naked). Well, my friend (pet psychologist,
&gt;&gt;&gt; self-proclaimed) suggested, &quot;Maybe she's wondering what you did that was
&gt;&gt;SO
&gt;&gt;&gt; BAD, that you need THAT much water.&quot; (he-he)

I agree about not letting cats outside. My mother won't let me keep my 5
cats inside because she thinks they have fleas.(which by my judgement, they
don't) Can you help me find a way for her to let me keep them inside?
