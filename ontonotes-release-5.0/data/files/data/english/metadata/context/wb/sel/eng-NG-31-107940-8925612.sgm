Hi all,

I'm heading on a trip soon and would love to hear from anyone who
flies in Australia or New Zealand, or even better someone who has used
their US license in either of those countries.

I'm keen to see some bits of these beautiful countries from the air.

Even if you don't use your FAA certificate and take an instructor I
can recommend a route from Queenstown NZ to Milford Sound and return
via Doubtful sound. Absolutely spectacular. Next time I'll fly near
Mount Cook area. By road it's 3.5 sides of a square and takes all day
to drive!

Another spectacular trip was to the North end of North Island. Found a
company with a seaplane but too costly but they had a C172 in a field
5 minutes away :-) I think it was from Haruru Falls near Bay of
Islands.

I'm from Scotland, UK but we only have little mountains!

The Space Shuttle landing strip had to be made before 9/11! We used to
be able to take the &quot;Cape Tour&quot; by calling up their frequency, but that
ended with 9/11. I used to fly over it in formation with several others
after Saturday breakfast at TICO.

On AOPA, there is a forum for international flying that has some tips
on flying in Australia. Last month's AOPA magazine had an article on
some pilots who flew around Australia over the great outback with some
nice pictures of the Ayers rock from open cockpits. It would be a
dream to fly in Australia or NZ for sure, so dont miss this chance :)

I think in NZ most clubs have access to a 152 or 172, rental price for
a 172 is ~$150 US /hr wet. You might need to take a mountain flying
course -depends where you are planning to go. Try working out where
you will go and then google the nearest clubs or post a Q here to get
contact details before you arrive.

You can 'mail me off list if you have a specific Q.

Cheers

I thought there was some new rule that screwed up non-Austalian certified
pilots from renting aircraft in Australia. Some company that was doing
specificly that closed up or was going to close because of it.

We flew with that company, he sort of gave up (had lots of other cool
things to do) before they sorted out the mess.  There is another company
doing it.  There's a bunch of paperwork, but we flew around the
Outback and it was really the best time we've had.  Well worth it.  I
don't think I would fly the Outback on my own (without the tour guides,
plans,group, etc.) as you can fly for hours without seeing much but
sheep below you.  It's really something when you notice every water bore
(well) in the outback is on the chart.  We had some 4.5 hour legs as
there was nowhere to land inbetween.

All that being said I'd go back tomorrow.  It was a fabulous experience
and I wish we'd been there 2 or 3 months rather than 3 weeks.
