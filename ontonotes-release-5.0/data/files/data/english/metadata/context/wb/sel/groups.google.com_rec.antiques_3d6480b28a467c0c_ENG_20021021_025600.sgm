It seems, without exception, every time I see some dealer/eBay seller
use the term &quot;museum quality,&quot; the item being sold is DEFINITELY NOT
museum quality.

When someone uses this term, I also notice that his/her ad or listing
is often cluttered with other such extreme hubris that makes it sound
like the dealer/seller is some kind of con artist. It's often
accompanied by the ludicrous phrase, &quot;a must for your collection.&quot; How
do you know what is in my collection that I &quot;must&quot; have this?

When used on eBay, &quot;museum quality&quot; sellers most often have
ridiculously high opening prices they never get. When used in antique
shops, the object in question is often caked with dust, having sat for
years without interest. It seems that people who use the term &quot;museum
quality&quot; have unrealistically high expectations about what the item
will bring, while at the same time revealing their woeful ignorance of
what is actually in museums. I often find that such people, if I'm
dealing with them on a face-to-face basis, have a certain brash
arrogance, as if I'm expected to believe their b.s. just because they
dish it up.

Sometimes the term &quot;museum quality&quot; is used as a shield in hopes that
people will ignore the object's many repairs/flaws. I was at a show
recently and saw a rather ordinary piece of Chinese Export that had
been repaired several times. The seller had a ridiculously high price
on it, plus the declaration &quot;museum quality,&quot; in the hope, I assume,
no one would be so crass as to comment about the several sloppy
repairs and gleefully reach for his wallet.

Once I was at a show, looking absently at a booth, and the pushy
seller piped up about at an item at which I had only barely glaced.
&quot;You should look more closely at that. It's 'museum quality.'&quot;

I replied, &quot;why hasn't a museum bought it then?&quot;

To which she had no response.

"/> Maybe they live in the Western US, where there are hundreds of
museums full of items damaged when they &quot;came over the Plains
in a wagon&quot;? (My favorite was in Wyoming, where a cracked
piece of Homer Laughlin mexican ware had such a disclaimer.)

&gt;The ones that really get me are 'VINTAGE' (wines fermented from

&gt;an original or duplicated individual's signature or monogram!!

We go to a country auction every other week or so, run by a guy named
Tom Hall. Not long ago, he held up a bowl, took out a pen and wrote
on the bottom. &quot;Okay, what'm I bid?&quot; he said. &quot;It's signed
'Hall's'!&quot;
