I thought the lid may be for merely transporting when the contents was
being emptied and bowl replaced ... Mm mm?? ... never use a spittoon
myself, always prefer the sizzle of the spit (gob as we call it) as it
hits the hob or turf. ;&gt;))

Talking about refinement. Do you recall all that Nanking hype,
middle-late '80s, all that export stuff salvaged from the shipwreck,
the stuff being transported in tea, all in perfect condition after a
couple of hundreds years on the sea bed.. recall that hype??

....... well a friend bought a piece of that stuff, totally genuine
piece, it was a &quot;boke bowl&quot; you know, a vomit bowl. Like a spittoon
only much smaller, fits between cupped hands. At the time he paid 450
GB pounds, he turned down 1000 pounds for it within a matter days
after the Sotheby's (think, may have been Christie', anyway the sale
was held in Holland, I think). Geez, I wonder what happened to all
that stuff and all the hype, but I suppose he (my friend) would still
get at least his money back .. for the boke bowl .. Mm mm?? :)

====

Well, &quot;gag me with a spoon&quot;!
This is truly gross.
What is this thing, a miniature
spitton? Does it have a lid?
How big is it?
I did a little web search
for &quot;boke bowl&quot; and didn't see
one.
I finally broke down and ordered
Millers Chinese and Japnese book.
It should be here in a day or two,
maybe there will be one in there.

This is a gross subject, but
not as gross as the one long
ago about serving stew in
the thunder mug. That has to
be the all time gross out.

"/> Dear Ronnie,
Thanks!

(This is really a coded message to YOU,
Mari. See, where I say &quot;Ronnie&quot;, I really
mean &quot;Mari&quot;. Have you got the home
made aluminum foil antenae tightened up?
Got the aluminum foil lining in your shoes
to keep away the Earth Rays?
Good, I am transmitting
marching order from your leader,
Pair O' Noid, the Earl of Uranus.)

Sigh... still there Ronnie? ;)

So the boke has an indention
in it similar to, say, the indention
in a barber bowl?
Ah, rats. I have
a little Export famile rose
piece that looks like a mini spitton,
but it has no indention. Another
1000 pounds down the drain. ;)
It has an old paper label
on the bottom which reads
&quot;Opium Spitoon&quot;
and I have always wondered whether
that was a flight of fancy on the
part of the previous owner or whether
it was correct.
Learning this oriental stuff is taking
me years. I have not gotten a handle
on what shapes are for what purpose
yet. It is probably just some
sort of brush pot.
Anyway, thanks for the tip.
You never know when one is going
to come along.

"/> Puking, thunder mugs and now bleeding.
Aieee! I had not ever given this a bit
of thought either. I suppose one might
have been bled into a barber bowl.
(Or maybe Fayette's hairdresser
used it to conk her boyfriend
on the noggin and that is how
the indention got there.)
I suppose if I had thought anything at
all about it, I thought they used leaches
to bleed people.
Hmmm... Interesting, Ron. I had just assumed (!)
that they were shaving bowls, there to keep the
lather that might fall off onto one's clothes.

I had occaision to go on a house call
a few years ago and saw the best priviate collection
of oriental porcelain I may ever see.
They were selling off a few pieces and
my getting in was just pure luck.
(And I wish I had known then what I know
now.) They wouldn't sell any of the
barber bowls but they had, oh, more than
ten, maybe as many as twenty. You really
should have seen the stuff they had.
The one thing I always have regretted not
buying was an Export armorial tea caddy.
It was expensive but there were still a few
dollars left for me to make on it, I think.
And it was great. I should have bought it.

Bleeding? Makes one glad one lives in the
20th and hopefully the 21st Century.
You have surely not seen it, but there is
a comedian these days over this way
named Chris Rock who is very funny.
He was doing a bit about medical science
and its failures.
He says, you go blind and you go to the
Doctor. The Doctor says, you're blind.
Let me give you this dog.
And you reply,
&quot;A dog? That is the best
you can do? A dog?&quot;

Struck me funny anyway, may have lost
quite a bit in the translation.

Gee Ghost,
Foiled again!
Sorry I don't read everything. Only reason I came to this thread was
curiosity about bokes. Lo and behold, I see my name right smack dab in
the middle of ghost posties! Maybe Uranus is paranoid, mines not.
You seem to be thinking about me even when I'm not around, quite a
complement!
Maybe I'll read everything you post from here on in, just to be sure
you don't use my name in vain. Might reconsider using it in your posts
to Ronnie though, I feel another black ball whoooshing toward my pins
again. OOOps.

"/> ------------------
A game pie at ole' Todd's shop would be most gamy, it would. Nothing like a
little head cheese, eh?

Quotes below are purloined, non-quotes are not.

&quot;The origin of the barber's pole appears to be associated with his service
of bloodletting. The original pole has a brass basin at its top representing
the vessel in which leeches were kept and also represented the basin which
received the blood. The pole itself represented the staff which the patient
held onto during the operation. The red and white stripes represented the
bandages used during the procedure, red for the bandages stained with blood
during the operation and white for the clean bandages. The bandages would be
hung out to dry after washing on the pole and would blow and twist together
forming the spiral pattern similar to the modern day barber pole.

&quot;The bloodstained bandages became recognized as the emblem of the
barber-surgeon's profession. Later in time, the emblem was replaced by a
wooden pole of white and red stripes. These colors are recognized as the
true colors of the barber emblem.&quot;

However, as we Yanks know; red, white and blue are widely used here probably
due to the fact that Old Glory has these colors - a Yankee twist on a
European tradition. Although another interpretation of these barber pole
colors is that red represents arterial blood, blue is symbolic of venous
blood and white depicts the bandage.

After formation of the United Barber Surgeons Company in England, a statute
required barbers to use a blue and white pole and surgeons to use a red
pole. In France the surgeons of the long robe placed a red pole with a
basin attached to identify their offices.

Hi Bill,
It would be quite fitting that a barber had the same manner of address
as a surgeon. Barbers of old were given the right to set broken bones,
pull teeth and believe it or not, make and curl wigs. Seems taking a
little off the top might be a bit risky.

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,
His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
He shaved the faces of gentle men,
Who never thereafter were heard of again.
He trod a path that few have trod,
Did Sweeney Todd...
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

He kept a shop in London Town,
Of fancy clients and good renown.
And what if none of their souls were saved,
They went to their maker impeccably shaved.
By Sweeney,
By Sweeney Todd...
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

His needs were few, his room was bare,
A barber pole and a fancy chair.
A mug of suds and leather strop,
An apron, a towel, a pale, and a mop.
For neatness he deserves a nod,
Did Sweeney Todd...
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Inconspicuous, Sweeney was.
Quick, and quiet, and clean he was.
Back of his smile, under his word,
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned,
Like a perfect machine he ran.
Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle.

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,
He served a dark and a vengeful god.
What happened then, well that's the play,
And he wouldn't want us to give it away.
Not Sweeney,
Not Sweeney Todd...
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Ah, waken up, Trance, other than shave people what other services did
the barber of &quot;old&quot; offer?

This is your starter for 10 :)))

"/> Yea I think you're probably right, Bill. The barbers of London were
first organized as a religious guild but were granted a charter as a
trade guild in 1462 by King Edward IV. This guild was amalgamated with
that of the surgeons in 1540 under a charter granted by Henry VIII,
and the members of the joint corporation were accorded the right to be
addressed as &quot;Master&quot; British surgeons still prefix their names with
&quot;Mr.&quot; instead of &quot;Dr.&quot;

The barber-surgeons were sometimes called &quot;doctors of the short robe&quot;
to distinguish them from university-trained physicians and surgeons,
whose superiority was apt to be only in their knowledge of Latin and
their title of &quot;doctor of the long robe.&quot; In England the guild of
surgeons was separated from that of barbers in 1745. The Royal College
of Surgeons, however, did not receive its charter until 1800.

Ambroise Paré 1510-1590 regarded by some medical historians as the
father of modern surgery was among those who gave shaves and haircuts
for a living.

Woken up, Knocking in sight,
Isn't that Sweeney there beside you?

He served a dark and hungry god.
To seek revenge may lead to hell...
But everyone does it if seldom as well.

Snip....Snip....snippy...snip..and a bit more off the top......

FWIW One of my uncles, George Grant Macdonald (father of the
silversmith Grant George Macdonald!) was an interesting man. He was a
specialistin two different fields of surgery (Obst &amp; Heart) yet gave
it up to goback into general practice as &quot;Dr Mac&quot; in a busy North
London general practice because he felt this was the greatest need. He
was Master of the Barber Surgeon's (or whatever the title is) at one
time and I went to the Barber's Hall for a family event he held there.
The hall and mealwere great, but some of the items in the archives
would put you off your dinner.

In the top Oxford teaching hospitals, they are currently using leeches
again for blood letting in certain disorders and also maggots for
cleaning incurable bedsores..absolutely true.

graphing, plastic surgery (non cosmetic, usually replacing body parts
on bomb victims) and of course gun shot wounds, over the years this
hospital has become the foremost in the UK for gun shot wounds, and
putting back severed limbs, which isn't all that surprising,
considering its location.

Our friend, who works at the hospital, as senior pharmacist, is also

found my name posted unexpectedly in a loose thread (by you),
I could only assume you did so to see what reaction you might have
gotten from me.
Your first e-mail (5:36 a.m.)PDT still left an opening to us becoming
friends, as long as I
used caution in the future. Your second e-mail titled &quot;leave me alone!&quot;
posted 8:53 a.m. said I had already screwed up (in my sleep?) and I must
never speak TO you, or ABOUT you. Now here's the funny part, you said
I had given you my word on this. and quote&quot; was my word good or wasn't
it?
Apparently mine is more accountable than yours. I have not attacked
you, just tried some good-natured responses in places I found my
name used. Get a grip T, if you leave openings I'm not going to pretend
you're invisible, Honey, you're not a REAL ghost.!
The only explanation I can find for your flip-flop-friendship-fiasco is
a reprimand from the first chair of R.A. Good lord man, if he knows

Pardon, that is Mari with an &quot;i&quot;,
Well, I am at wits end. If the concept
of before truce and after truce does
not mean anything to you then how
can I expect to have a rational
discussion with you? It is not
a difficut differntiation to make.

I have tried everything I know to do.
You seem to be here just to entertain
yourself by picking fights.

I say this again. You gave me your
word, we made an agreement to shake
hands and be friends. You made
a mistake and took a post that
was written in response to the mistake
you made previously as one current
and took exception to it.

So, repeat this again,
is your word good or not?
Yes or no?
If you break your word then
I will suppose that you
are just here as troll.

But I am, still going to keep
my end of the bargain.
I hope you are an honest person
and not a troll. I hope you
will keep your word.

It is all up to you now, Mari.
I have kept my word.
Keep yours.

Incredible. I read about a U.S. pilot who had crashed during the Viet

and treated with maggots. He had always thought that it was torture,
but later learned that without the treatment, he would have probably
died from septicemia secondary to gangrene. &lt;yuk!&gt;

As for the leech therapy, I think it has something to do with what the
leech secretes into the bloodstream during feeding rather than the
old-time thinking that the leech was extracting the illness. Very
cool.

I watch ER and Chicago Hope too much, and found out that leeches are
used here when hands/fingers/limbs are reattached. Since the blood
vessels were also cut, and not all can be repaired, the leeches are used
to removed the excess blood in the limb to keep it from swelling up too
badly.

I think I could handle the leeches if need be, but I'd have nightmares
about those maggots! &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele

Our western sensibilities about bugs summed up in one word - Yuck!

In other cultures, maggots are a delicacy, especially fried and crunchy!

I believe the leeches actually do remove blood. The use I know about
was for reducing the amount of swelling in a reattached ear.
And yes they are kept in big-city hospitals in the US. (I'm not so
sure about the maggots!)

"/> Actually, I rang my friend, who works as a pharmacist in one of our
local hospitals and she being the keeper of the leeches at the
hospital :)

Here's basically what she explained to me, which is the simple
version.

The leech is used to relieve congestion during reattachment of the
severed limb, or digit and in skin graphing and skin flaps as well as
other plastic surgery procedures. The juice in the salvia of the leech
acts like an natural anticoagulant. The leech bites and leave small
pin holes, from which the patient's blood can ooze, because of the
anticoagulant, when the leech feeds and then eventually falls off, the
pin hole bites will remain open and the blood will continue to ooze.
The other advantage of the leech, they produce a natural local
anaesthetic directly to surgery area.

At least that is the main use in her hospital which specialize in
plastic surgery and the reattachment of severed limbs, their expertise
mainly coming from their long practice with bomb victims.

leaving heathy tissue behind. This appearently reduces the chance of gangrene,
which is caused by anaerobic bacteria infecting the dead/dying tissue. Yum Yum
