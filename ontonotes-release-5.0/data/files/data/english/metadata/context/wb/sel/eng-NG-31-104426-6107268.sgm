*Trials for 'bionic' eye implants*

A bionic eye implant that could help restore the sight of millions of blind
people could be available to patients within two years. *

US researchers have been given the go-ahead to implant the prototype device
in 50 to 75 patients.

The Argus II system uses a spectacle-mounted camera to feed visual
information to electrodes in the eye.

Patients who tested less-advanced versions of the retinal implant were able
to see light, shapes and movement.

"What we are trying to do is take real-time images from a camera and convert
them into tiny electrical pulses that would jump-start the otherwise blind
eye and allow patients to see," said Professor Mark Humayun from the
University of California.

to receiver under surface of eye
4: Receiver sends information to electrodes in retinal implant
5: Electrodes stimulate retina to send information to brain

Retinal implants are able to partially restore the vision of people with
particular forms of blindness caused by diseases such as macular
degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa.

About 1.5 million people worldwide have retinitis pigmentosa, and one in 10
people over the age of 55 have age-related macular degeneration.

Both diseases cause the retinal cells which process light at the back of the
eye to gradually die.

The new devices work by implanting an array of tiny electrodes into the back
of the retina.

A camera is used to capture pictures, and a processing unit, about the size
of a small handheld computer and worn on a belt, converts the visual
information into electrical signals.

These are then sent back to the glasses and wirelessly on to a receiver just
under the surface of the front of the eye, which in turn feeds them to the
electrodes at the rear.

The whole process happens in real time.

*Growing dots*

First-generation, low-resolution devices have already been fitted to six
patients.

"The longest device has been in for five years," said Professor Humayun.

"It's amazing, even with 16 pixels, or electrodes, how much our first six
subjects have been able to do."

Terry Byland, 58, from California was fitted with an implant in 2004 after
going blind with retinitis pigmentosa in 1993.

"At the beginning, it was like seeing assembled dots - now it's much more
than that," he said.

"When I am walking along the street I can avoid low-hanging branches - I can
see the edges of the branches."

Mr Byland is also able to make out other shapes.

"I can't recognise faces, but I can see them like a dark shadow," he said.

*Brain change*

The new implant has a higher resolution than the earlier devices, with 60
electrodes.

It is also a lot smaller, about one square millimetre, which reduces the
amount of surgery that needs to be done to implant the device.

The technology has now been given the go-ahead by the US Food and Drug
Administration to be used in an exploratory patient trial.

This will take place at five centres across America over two years, with
50-75 patients aged over 50.

If successful, the device could be commercialised soon after, costing around
$30,000 (£15,000). Other devices could then be developed with higher
resolution or a wider field of view, said Professor Humayun.

Future work includes studying the effects the implants have on the brain.

"We are actually studying what happens to the visual cortex over time," said
Professor Humayun.

The research was presented at the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in San Francisco, US.
