Travel Agents are treated differently than the rest of us. And the
reason is simple: The travel industry is a 4 trillion dollar a year
business!
With that kind of money being spent on travel, you can just imagine
the competition. The travel industry will spend millions on
advertising and they'll do what ever it takes to get them their piece
of the pie.
It's a known fact; the travel industry survives on the business
supplied to them by Travel Agents. And because so much of their
business relies on Travel Agents, the travel industry treats these
Travel Agents like royalty!
In all honesty, if a travel related business or vendor is not known
and utilized by the country's travel agents, their business will
suffer tremendously. In other words, travel companies need Travel
Agents to survive...their business depends on them!
And most people don't know that becoming a travel agent is quick and
easy if you know the secrets. In fact, with our exclusive insider
information contained in the Travel Industry Secrets, you'll actually
become a licensed Travel Agent in about twenty minutes...it's that
quick and it's that easy!
When you become a Travel Agent, new doors are opened and courtesies
are extended to you, that everyday folks aren't privy to. Like I said,
travel companies need travel agents and when you become one of them,
you'll be showered with discounts and gratuities by way of deeply
discounted and even free travel benefits.

There are Travel Agents and then there are Professional Travel Agents.
Know this. You won't be getting the freebies just for being a TA. You
*earn* them through bookings or agency paid "Fam" trips.

What separates the Pros from the others? Read on:

Travel Agent Myths and Realities
*Myth:* /*
*/*Travel agents are just glorified sellers of airline tickets and their
time has come and gone.*
*Reality:* Travel agents are professionals who provide value by helping
consumers cut through the clutter and save time and money. They act as
travel counselors, offering personal service for their clients.

Today’s successful travel agent recognizes that consumers do their
homework and are more knowledgeable about what they want. Clients who
turn to an ASTA travel agent want the advice and expertise of a
professional who:

• Extracts product information;
• Investigates and supplies competitive information;
• Stays abreast of the most current and timely promotions;
• Analyzes the current promotions;
• Clarifies the fine print, such as cancellation penalties and
restrictions;
• Makes recommendations on travel-related options;
• Simplifies the research and subsequent transaction;
• Enhances the trip with value-added benefits and amenities;
• Uses their clout to obtain the best possible arrangements in
seemingly impossible situations; and
• Gets problems resolved.

*Myth:* *The Internet will replace the need for travel agents.*
*Reality:* When it comes to booking travel, travel agents are
experienced professionals. Travel agents sell:

*87% of all cruises*

*81% of all tours and packages*

*51% of all airline tickets*

*47% of all hotels*

*45% of all cars*

There are some things technology cannot replicate, and personal touch is
one of them. The Internet is a valuable resource, but it cannot replace
the expertise, guidance and personal service of a travel agent. At a
time when travelers are stressed out with hectic schedules, travel
agents have all of the information at their fingertips, saving valuable
hours of surfing the Web. Agents also can offer insider tips generally
based on personal experience.

*Myth: Travel agents do not support use of the Internet.*
*Reality:* Both consumers and travel professionals benefit from the
Internet.

The Internet has helped transform the travel industry. The Internet
gives travelers the ability to do comparative shopping for attractive
deals or packages. It has also helped many travel agencies, hotels,
resorts and other travel-related suppliers flourish by bringing in
business through Web sites.

The Internet has become such an integral part of the travel agency
business that 98 percent of ASTA agencies currently subscribe to a
consumer online service or an Internet access provider in order to help
them better serve their clients. Gathering information increasingly
involves the use of the Internet. Almost 95 percent of agents have
conducted online research. Nearly 83 percent of ASTA agencies report
they have booked directly on suppliers’ Web sites without using their
GDS or calling the supplier in question.

*Myth:* *Young people do not understand or value the services of a
travel agent.*
*Reality: *Yes they do. Of the people who use travel agents:

43% baby boomers 43-60 yrs

33% gen x 18-33 years

One of the winners of ASTA’s and Hyatt’s “Best Practices Program” has
made a point to educate students about the adventure of travel and being
a travel agent as a career. This process has made young people aware of
the expertise required to be a professional travel agent and about the
value they offer.

*Myth:* *Minority travel is not a factor in the future of the travel
industry.*
*Reality:* Minority travel is one of the fastest growing niches in the
industry, and as more agencies continue developing specialties, this
will be reflected in the overall demographic of the travel agency industry.

ASTA recognizes this trend among consumers as well as within the
industry and has made a consolidated effort to reach out to Hispanic
agents with the “ASTA en Español” listserv on ASTAnet.

*Myth: All travel agencies and agents are the same.*
*Reality:* Every travel agency is different and accordingly, some are
better suited to a given consumer than others. Here are some tips on
choosing a travel agent who is right for you.

* *Go with the pros:* Look for the ASTA label. Through its
continuing education and training programs, ASTA prepares its
members to operate high-caliber, competitive businesses.
* *Ask around:* Tap friends, neighbors and relatives who use an
agent they trust. You may want to visit or call several agencies
to find the one that best suits your needs. Consider everything
from the appearance of the office to the agent’s willingness to
listen and answer questions. The best agents want to establish a
long-term relationship with a client, not just make one sale.
* *Ask about fees:* Good agents will notify their clients of any
additional fees, including service fees, up front. Doing otherwise
is pointless, as the fee will appear as a separate charge on the
client’s credit card bill.
* *Search the Web:* Go to TravelSense ( www.TravelSense.org ) and use
the “Find an Agent” tool. Search for agents with expertise in
destinations or specific subjects that interest you.
* *Check credentials:* Many agents have been trained in business
management, travel and tourism or geography. Others have
supplemented their agency experience with extensive education and
training courses. Some travel agents are Certified Travel
Counselors (CTC), having completed an educational program with the
Travel Institute, or Master Cruise Counselors (MCC), having
completed a program with the Cruise Lines International
Association (CLIA).
* *Find out an agency’s track record:* Call ASTA to see whether a
member agency has had a complaint against it in the prior six
months. Check with the local Better Business Bureau, while keeping
in mind they will only have records of agencies that have had
reports filed against them.

Too bad many book on their own usually and the pay sucks..but the
rewards are wonderful...Been in the biz since 87 and the changes are
staggering..Support a travel agent..it's free and they SHOULD know all
they sell.
