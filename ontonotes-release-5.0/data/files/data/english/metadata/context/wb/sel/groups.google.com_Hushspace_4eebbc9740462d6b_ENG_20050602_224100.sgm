I just found a folder which I apparently downloaded over a year ago. It was
titled &quot;Jeri's secret folder&quot;. I was almost afraid to open it.....lol It was
women with animals. But it turned out not to be as bad as it sounded.
Do you remember it Jeri?

Yes I do. It had nothing to do with me. It was part of the war of attrition
being waged upon me by TOM (now banned for being a threatening egocentric
agenda driven fuckwit) and George (who calmed down and injected a little
maturity into his life).
Keep it or delete it. Frankly I couldn't give a fuck.

Actually, the pictures were pretty good. But I moved them from the celeb

Shame the archive isn't there any more. Some of the posts made choice
reading especially in the context of other posts and with certain offboard
conversations taken into account. I've got a sense of humour but there's a point
where things aren't funny.

That was the posting a gazillion mbs of cats issue. You and TOM carried it
over to celebs_gossip. The Jeri's Folder thing happened at celebs_gossip as did
using cats as a background for your posts. That never happened at the panto
club and I have a feeling judging by the way they do things there that if you
had it would not have gone on long enough there for anyone to compile an
actal folder of posts. They were your little digs to try and piss me off. It
worked. Things changed. Now we are here.

Yes I do. It had nothing to do with me. It was part of the war of attrition
being waged upon me by TOM (now banned for being a threatening egocentric
agenda driven fuckwit) and George (who calmed down and injected a little
maturity into his life).
Keep it or delete it. Frankly I couldn't give a fuck.

That was the posting a gazillion mbs of cats issue. You and TOM carried it over to celebs_gossip. The Jeri's Folder thing happened at celebs_gossip as did using cats as a background for your posts. That never happened at the panto club and I have a feeling judging by the way they do things there that if you had it would not have gone on long enough there for anyone to compile an actal folder of posts. They were your little digs to try and piss me off. It worked. Things changed. Now we are here.
