Welcome to alt.binaries.amazon-women.admirers.

This file is posted regularly to alt.binaries.amazon-women.admirers (hereafter abawa).

abawa is a group intended to handle the binaries being posted to alt.amazon-women.admirers (hereafter aawa), now a non binaries group on many servers.

I have kept the description of &quot;what is an amazon&quot; from the original aawa FAQ intact in this FAQ. You can read the aawa FAQ here for those interested in the history of the groups.

Please read this FAQ. Lurk and leach for a while and get to know the group before posting to abawa.
As a regular of aawa for many years I often thought about the need for a sister group that could handle the binaries for aawa. The increasing number of News Service Providers (NSP's) blocking binaries in aawa is what finally pushed me to create the new group. Of course I had no idea how to do that so a bit of research had to be done. Then you have to get beat up in alt.config for a while. It is worth staying there and learning as much as you can before creating the group. And that's the easy part. Propagating the group is the most time consuming. It is a never ending job. I would like to ask everyone to promote the group and encourage people who don't get abawa, to ask their NSP to add it.
Please email me your comments and input. They are much appreciated.

Thanks,

TheSNakE

01: What is a FAQ file?

A FAQ file is a file that contains answers to Frequently

Asked Questions about an electronic forum.

-------------------------------------------------------------

02: What is alt.binaries.amazon-women-admirers?

alt.binaries.amazon-women.admirers is a newsgroup dedicated to Amazon women and their admirers. abawa provides a forum for the posting of images and videos of Amazon women.

-------------------------------------------------------------

03: abawa official charter.

Here is a copy of the official charter included in the control message sent on November 11, 2003. This charter cannot be altered.

CHARTER: alt.binaries.amazon-women.admirers is a newsgroup dedicated to and for the posting of binary files regarding pictures and multimedia clips (i.e. videos) of amazon women.

The newsgroup will not be moderated. Spam, off-topic posts, child pornography, trolling, and harassing of posters will not be permitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------

04: What should I post in abawa??

These suggestions are basic USENET etiquette and are printed here as a guide for keeping the group organized and efficient for us all.

Abawa was created for the posting and leaching, of images and videos, of amazon women.

This can include art work, (drawings, or paintings, digital or scanned) as long as it is stated in the subject header.

Before you post, please read the FAQ. Lurk and leach for a while and get to know the group.

This is a binaries newsgroup. No discussions of any kind should be posted to the group, except questions about particular posts.

Requests are welcome and encouraged.

All posts should include a description of the file in the subject header.

All yEnc posts should have yenc in the subject header.

It is recommended the poster include an index file if posting more than 10 or 12 pictures, depending on their size. Preview files for large videos should also be considered for unknown productions. A short, low quality video, or a few screen captures would let people know if they want to download the post. An index will prevent the downloader from wasting bandwidth on files they already have or don't want.

05: What is an amazon? What is an Amazon?

(This section written by Jim Woodard and Thomas Gramstad

Copyright Jim Woodard and Thomas Gramstad 1994)

The following represents, not a dogma check list, nor a

complete cast-in-stone description, but a few images,

attitudes and guide-lines that point towards an outline of

the Amazon concept.

-------------

Here are what I consider some typical and important amazon

characteristics:

(I hasten to add that I do not claim that this is an exhaustive

list; nor do I claim that all these characteristics have to be

present, nor that they have the same degree of importance. They

are, however, personality traits or perceptual concretes that I

immediately associate with 'amazon'.)

-- athletically built; strong, muscular (and proud of it)

-- courageous, self-assertive, capable of independent

decision-making and action

-- a particular &quot;heavy&quot; or unconsciously self-confident way of

walking, stressing certainty and physical strength (&quot;cat-like&quot;)

-- she &quot;owns and occupies&quot; her physical space through her body

language -- she doesn't &quot;shrink&quot; herself by trying to appear

small or by trying not to occupy her space

-- preference for &quot;rough&quot;, practical clothing (e.g. sportswear,

jeans, leather jackets)

-- a &quot;strong&quot; face, direct and vivid eyes (hard to be specific here,

but it's the opposite of the kind of ethereal, non-emotional,

remote, passive, away-from-this-world-looking expression that

one may find in some artworks that are considered to express

&quot;femininity&quot;).

Having a &quot;defined&quot; angular face may add to the 'Amazon image'.

-- her looks is not the most important part of her self-concept (even

if she is photo-model beautiful)

-- no or little make-up/fake-up

-- a direct and open personality; no insincere behavior

[From an interview with Thomas Gramstad in _Different Loving_,

(Brames, Brames &amp; Jacobs (Eds.)), Villard, 1993.]

-------------

In summary we can say that Amazons are physically and

psychologically strong, assertive women who are not afraid to

break free from traditional ideas about and limitations of

gender roles and femininity.

In short, the classical ideal about mind-body harmony and

unified strength -- only extended to women.

Some people will emphasize the spiritual aspects.

Some people will emphasize the physical aspects.

Some people, hopefully, will emphasize both.

06: History

ABAWA was started in November 2003 by TheSNakE.

AAWA was started in December 1993 by Jim Woodard.

-------------------------------------------------------------

07: How to combine multi part messages.

(This section was posted by aawa regular, fbblove, and edited by me.)

Newsgroup posting sizes are expressed as &quot;lines&quot;, and binaries are encoded. Encoding can be either Uuencode or Base64 and now yEnc. Though Base64 is arguably better, most of the postings are encoded via Uuencode. Much of the large binaries are now posted in yEnc.

Most news servers are limited to the number of lines any particular post can have, so large files (like videos) are broken up into parts.

A three-part movie would have a subject line of something like this:

video.mpg (1/3)

video.mpg (2/3)

video.mpg (3/3)

You must re-assemble these parts back into the original video.mpg to view the whole thing. Here's how. These instructions might have to be modified slightly to work on various versions of the particular program.

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, ENSURE ALL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE ON YOUR NEWS SERVER. If any parts are missing, you won't be able to see that movie. Although, if you can get the first and last part, you can view what's available on your server. And a hint: Consider sorting messages by Subject, not Date. That keeps parts together. If you do have missing parts, see the section on Pars.

--FREE AGENT--

Free Agent (and Agent) are by far the best news clients to collect multipart binaries in newsgroups.

Available free for download at  . Put in your news server and system information under Options, User and System Profile. To set up default download directory, right-click the in the Group listing, and choose Default Properties. Click the Attachments tab, and enter the directory you want to save the movies into. Right-click ANY of the parts of the video (it doesn't have to be the first part) and choose &quot;Decode Binary Attachments&quot;. Free Agent will automatically download all the relevant parts and save them in the specified directory.

--AGENT--

Available from   - costs money, but highly recommended.

It's indispensable if you use newsgroups a lot, especially ones that are mostly binary. First, right-click the in the group listing, and choose Default Properties. Click the Directory tab, and enter in the directory you want to save the movies. Agent usually automatically combines all the parts into one line on the screen. Instead of the three lines listed above, all it would show is this one line:

video.mpg (*/3)

Then you just double-click the line, and Agent will download all the parts in the right order, decode and combine them, and save the output file to a pre-determined directory. Otherwise, select all the parts and then Right Click and select Join.

--MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EXPRESS--

Highlight all the parts (click the first part and CTRL-click the other parts). Then go to the &quot;Message&quot; menu and select &quot;Combine and Decode&quot;. A window will appear - ensure all the parts are there, and make sure they are in the correct order (use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to correct if necessary). The parts will be downloaded, and an email window will appear with the full video as an attachment. Go to the File menu and choose Save Attachments, then using the next window, save the video where ever you wish. You can then view the entire video.

--NETSCAPE NEWS READER--

I don't believe it's possible to combine/decode multi-part postings via the Netscape newsreader. Either get Agent/Free Agent, or use this manual procedure. Click each part and save it on your hard drive. Extension is not critical, but for ease use .001 for the first part.002 for the second, etc. Go to   and download a Uudecoder (search for uudecode) and follow that program's instructions. Just point it to the .001 file and it should find the other parts automatically, and spit the video.mpg out. You might have to type in the filename of the output video file.

--TROUBLESHOOTING--

By far the most common problem is poor propagation. News postings are sent across the world by moving from one news server to the next (a network collectively known as Usenet). Large dedicated news servers (like SuperNews) have multiple connections to the Usenet, and usually get 100% of the postings. Internet Service Providers (ISP) usually only have a single connection, so they might simply miss many postings. News servers also expire (delete) articles, based on storage space and current Usenet traffic. So even if your ISP gets the large posts, they typically don't have a lot of storage, and expire postings quickly (within a day or so), or they don't accept larger posts at all (supposedly AOL is notorious for not accepting large posts).

If you consistently have problems of incomplete (or missing) posts, consider getting a Giganews, Easynews, Usenetserver, SuperNews, or NewsReader.com account (for instance). If you only see the last file of posts (like just the 5/5 file, or the 8/8 file) you know the problem is your ISP. The last file is the smallest, and your ISP is blocking the other larger files.

-------------------------------------------------------------

08: Information on yEnc.

All on-topic yEnc posts will be welcome in abawa. Unfortunately not all news readers, and some providers like AOL, do not support yEnc. I would like to discourage anyone from posting with yEnc in abawa if you do not have a preference. I suggest this only because the constant bickering and the endless string of questions, clutter up the newsgroup with flame wars. Some people still like yEnc, so it is inevitable that you will see yEnc posts. If you are interested in those posts you will need a little information.

Just go here:   for lot's of info.

If you have Microsoft Outlook Express go here:   for yProxy to decode yEnc. Full instructions are on the site on how to use the program.

Go here:   for a Windows yEnc Coder/Decoder. Just save the message and decode with yenc32.

Newsreaders such as Xnews ( ) and Forte Agent/Free Agent ( ) automatically decode yEnc. Xnews and Free Agent are freeware.

-------------------------------------------------------------

09: What is a RAR file?

From: Slyck's Guide to The Newsgroups -

This is an excellent site that has all the info in this FAQ and more.

RAR format started out as a compression utility like WinZip and became the standard on the newsgroups because of its ability to split up the archive that it makes. Like any great story, RAR's consist of 3 sections: a beginning, middle, and an end.

Beginning - From WinRAR 3.0 on, the first file of the archive has an extension of .part1.rar. Prior to version 3.0 it would be .rar. This is the file you open to extract the entire archive.

Middle - These are all the files that lie between the Beginning and the End. They should all have exactly the same size as the Beginning file. Due to the nature of the newer YENC encoding, these files may appear to have slightly different sizes when displayed in the news reader. This is normal, just make sure that once they are decoded on your hard drive they all have exactly the same size.

End - This is the last file of the archive and is distinguishable by the shorter file size than the rest of the parts. As WinRAR adds data to the archive it chops off the file into equal pieces, the last piece will only contain whatever is left of the archive at the end.

WinRAR has become the standard archiving tool used on the newsgroups. With the ever increasing size of media files, rar files are popping up in newsgroups that once housed small media files. Newsgroups that once had albums chopped up into mp3's are now full of RAR archives of high quality ISOs of albums. Getting the latest copy and understanding what a complete archive set consists of is crucial.

Get WinRAR here:

So what do you do if you have downloaded an archive with 47 parts and 2 of them are missing? Read the next section to find out what to do about missing files.

-------------------------------------------------------------

10: What are PAR and PAR2 files?

From: Slyck's Guide to The Newsgroups -

PAR files are GODs gift to the newsgroups. They are the answer to the problem of missing files. [PAR]ity files are used to reconstruct files that are missing from the archive. For example, if you have downloaded an archive that was split into 47 RAR files but one of them is missing, you could simply download a PAR file for that archive. Once you have the PAR file, you can use SmartPAR to reconstruct the missing file.

BUT WAIT, there's more... You can reconstruct ANY missing part (samplegame.r02 or samplegame.r06 or samplegame.r37) with ANY PAR file (samplegame.P01 or samplegame.P04 or samplegame.P05).

BUT WAIT, there's more... If you are missing 2 parts, get 2 PAR files and they will reconstruct both missing parts. 3 parts missing? Get 3 PAR files and you're good.

Here's the catch... There is a limit to the amount of files you can reconstruct. The limit is the amount of PAR files that were posted for the archive. Generally PAR files number 5-10 per posting and have become a standard very quickly. So, if an archive has 5 PAR files, you will only be able to reconstruct a maximum of 5 parts.

This is only an example of a one par file system only capable of reconstructing one file. It gets more complicated with more PAR files and more missing files but the idea is the same.

PAR files are simple to spot. They use the following extension system: .PAR, .P01, .P02, .P03, etc.
The .PAR file is an index file for the set and does not count towards reconstructing any files (it is usually less than 1K). The .PAR file is the one you open in SmartPAR, although if it is missing also, it is not critical and the reconstruction will still work by opening any of the actual PAR files.

So, you have a couple of missing files, you have a couple of PAR files for the archive, what do you do now? Get SmartPAR! This is the program that will take the PAR files and construct new files from them.

Get SmartPar here:

What about PAR2?

Par 2.0 specification is a system of repairing incomplete or slightly damaged files. Here is a list of the features included in version 2.0:

PAR 2.0 either completely removes or significantly reduces these limitations:

--- Damaged files can be repaired. A single byte error in a 10MB file might only require the use of recovery data from a PAR file that is only 100KB in size.

--- There is no relationship between the size of the data files and the size of the PAR files. Also, the PAR files will normally be of varied sizes allowing you to pick the size you need appropriate to the amount of damaged data you need to repair.

--- Damaged PAR files will still be useable. PAR 2.0 can use the undamaged parts of a PAR file.

--- PAR files can be generated from a single source file without the need to split it. On UseNet, this removes the need to use RAR or any other file splitter. Please note however, that due to the limitations of some newsreaders (which do not permit the download of incomplete files), it is advisable to use RAR to split very large files.

--- It can handle up to 32768 files.

An excellent comparison of PAR 1.0 to PAR 2.0 can be found here:

To be able to use PAR2 files to reconstruct damaged files, you should use a program called QuickPar.
