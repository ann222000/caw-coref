&quot;At last we are starting to see evolutionists admit the real nature
of their philosophy. It doesn’t matter what the evidence shows
(e.g., the fossil record), they will believe evolution is fact
regardless. As the Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory crumbles,
those who want to cling to an evolutionary philosophy do so no
matter what the evidence is. It is not an argument about facts,
but a conflict of worldviews--one centered in man: the other centered
on the absolute and authoritative Creator God.

&quot;It is a fight of mutually exclusive faiths which both provide a
solution to the observable problem of man’s guilt. Evolution offers
man ‘freedom’ by denying that guilt exists. The Creator God promises
to remove guilt if we will only humble ourselves, accept the death of
His Son Jesus Christ as just payment for the sin which produces human
guilt and then accept His right to be God and serve Him accordingly.

What is it about creationists that they do not grasp
that from the very first, from Darwin til today, that
evolution was not and is not based significantly
on the fosil record?  Darwin's thoughts were not
inspired by the fossil record, Darwin dismissed
the fossil record as providing evidence for his
theory, and although paleontology has advanced
enormously since Darwin's day, the primary evidence
for evolution still remains in the fields of
taxonomy, embyrology, biochemistry, genetics,
developmental biology, and population studies.

And why in the world do creationists believe that if evolution
were to disappear tomorrow, all that would be left to
explain the world would be their particular god?  Why
was the world not created by Bast, or Izanagi and Izanami,
or Gisoolg or -- infinitely more likely -- not some
being of our mythic imagination, but Some Thing
that we have no inkling of, and likely never will?

A global flood, as proposed by Ham, would have mixed up the fossils,
giving them no recognizable pattern with which to formulate an
evolutionary theory.  The fact that they show increasingly complex
organisms, and are stratigraphically separated, is indication that
millions of years is correct.  For instance, the young earth creation
science model says the layers of the Grand Canyon are Flood deposited,
but they contain no dinosaurs.  Dinosaur fossils are all located in the
Mesozoic rocks, which are stratigraphically above the Grand Canyon
layers.  How did the dinosaurs survive to this point?  At a minimum,
over a mile of sediment was deposited by the floodwaters, yet the
dinosaurs lived through it all!

Except of course that evolution &quot;centers&quot; on no creature, including
man, while creationism dictates that man is necessarily the highest
and most central form of life.

You should read Augustine's De Genesi Ad Litteram - it was a widely
influential interpretation of Genesis that allowed animals and plants to
come into being via secondary causes:

&quot;Where, then, were they [plants, when they were created]? Were they in
the earth in the &quot;reasons&quot; or causes from which they would spring, as
all things already exist in their seeds before they evolve [develop -
JSW] in one form or another and grow into their proper kinds in the
course of time? ... it appears [from Scripture - JSW] ... that the seeds
sprang from the crops and trees, and that the crops and trees themselves
came forth not from seeds but from the earth.&quot; [De Genesi Ad Litteram,
(The literal meaning of Genesis) c. 390 AD, Book V, chapt 4 (Augustine
1982: 151f)

Augustine, Saint Bishop of Hippo. The Literal Meaning of Genesis.
Translated by John Hammond Taylor, Ancient Christian Writers; No. 41-42.
New York, N.Y.: Newman Press, 1982.

It's not evolution but it isn't creationism either.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution isn't faith.  Creationism is a heretical faith at odds with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christianity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jesus was a creationist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No shit? He denied the transmutation of species? I didn't even think
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there *was* such a concept in 33CE...

&gt; &gt; which makes it all that much easier to disbelieve. dont play stupid
&gt; &gt; games. as a first century jew, jesus would have accepted the book of
&gt; &gt; genesis as authoritative on how the world came into being.

&gt; &gt; the idea that creationism is a &quot;heretical faith at odds with
&gt; &gt; christianity&quot; is a baldfaced lie.

&gt; You should read Augustine's De Genesi Ad Litteram - it was a widely
&gt; influential interpretation of Genesis that allowed animals and plants to
&gt; come into being via secondary causes:

&gt; &quot;Where, then, were they [plants, when they were created]? Were they in
&gt; the earth in the &quot;reasons&quot; or causes from which they would spring, as
&gt; all things already exist in their seeds before they evolve [develop -
&gt; JSW] in one form or another and grow into their proper kinds in the
&gt; course of time? ... it appears [from Scripture - JSW] ... that the seeds
&gt; sprang from the crops and trees, and that the crops and trees themselves
&gt; came forth not from seeds but from the earth.&quot; [De Genesi Ad Litteram,
&gt; (The literal meaning of Genesis) c. 390 AD, Book V, chapt 4 (Augustine
&gt; 1982: 151f)

&gt; Augustine, Saint Bishop of Hippo. The Literal Meaning of Genesis.
&gt; Translated by John Hammond Taylor, Ancient Christian Writers; No. 41-42.
&gt; New York, N.Y.: Newman Press, 1982.

&gt; It's not evolution but it isn't creationism either.

i dont see augustine doubting the alleged fact that these events took
place within 6 days.

No. Evolution is a fact. Anyone with a brain can observe the world around
them and see this fact.

Evoluionary theory is far from 'man centered'. That is left to religions who
place man at the pinnacle of perfection.

I find no evidence for an absolute and authoritative [sic] Creator God.
Neither does a large proportion of the humans living on this planet.

Your post is rubbish - however

Were it a fight between &quot;mutually exclusive faiths&quot; then Christianity has
a simple choice to make, adaptation to survive or suicide

Were there a fight between Christianity - or any other religion - and
science then it would be a fight to the death and the religion could NOT
survive

Christianity deperately needs to get its arse into gear and recognise that
Creationism and Fundamentalism are parasite based malignant diseases that
cross the theological boundaries of all religions and ideologies creating
competing pockets of mental illness

This malignancy - when it isn't fighting itself across imagined religious
boundaries, as in the Middle East - turns its destructive power against
its host religion

Reformation or oblivion - that is Christianity's real choice.  Survival
requires the purging of anti reason, anti science and anti-intellectualism
from the faith, and the embracing of the concept of human progress -
scientifically , economically , politically and as a result spiritually.

In the battle between Christian traditionalism and science , Christianity
lost long ago

Live with it.

Oh fuck. Read the fucking thing then. Augustine says quite a lot in that
book that isn't covered by a single paragraph. The point is that
believing the book of Genesis doesn't commit one to fixism, young earth
or wotnot.

I am seeing quite a lot of bigotry here, but it isn't from the theists.

Some post-Darwin Catholics tried to make that into an endorsement of
evolution. (Notably, John Zahm. FWIW, I agree with John W and not John
Z.)

Augustine does tend to be long-winded. It makes him difficult to
quote in this kind of forum.

One of the points that Augustine made in &quot;De genesi ad litteram&quot; is that
the &quot;days&quot; of Genesis 1 could not possibly represent even a sequence of
events, much less 6 orbits of the sun around the earth, but that rather
the Bible is describing 6 different facets of God's creation.

if you can distort the text to say anything you want it to say, in

in any case, what does augustine have to do with the views of jesus,
who lived centuries before augustine?

It is in the nature of language that we have to interpret the meaning
of any text.  The wide variation in translations should make this
clear.  Thus, &quot;believing in it&quot; cannot be limited to a specific
meaning of a specific text.  Instead, we choose to believe in certain
ideas, however they may be expressed.  Hopefully, we are not believing
those things merely because we &quot;want&quot; to believe them; that would be
sinful.  If one has faith in the Holy Spirit, then one also believes
that God will lead us in the proper direction.

If the ideas we have do not track with what we can clearly observe,
then we probably have the ideas wrong.  Even Augustine noted this,
1400 years before Darwin, which is why he is sometimes quoted on the
subject.

Jesus taught in parables, so the Christian should not be surprised
that Christian teachings will not necessarily be gleaned from the
literal meaning of words in the Bible.

The &quot;views of Jesus&quot; are particular interpretations of what the &quot;words
of Jesus&quot; mean in theological terms.

Augustine lived shortly after the Bible was first assembled into a
single book.  It was his thinking more than that of any other single
person except maybe Saul of Tarsus, that set forth the theology built
around the words of Jesus Christ and the events of His life.

For example, the &quot;doctrine of original sin&quot; comes from Augustine's
interpretation of the book, not from the words of the book themselves.
Many other concepts of Western Christianity were from Augustine's
interpretation of those Bible verses, not from any inherent &quot;meaning&quot;
that somehow transcends all the problems of communication in words.

the word &quot;day&quot; in genesis is not a matter of contention for

No it doesn't.  And even among those places where it does, the usage
may still be allegorical

The word day in Gen 1:13 is Hebrew transliterated as yowm

http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H03117...
Here are all the different words used to translate &quot;yowm&quot; in the KJV.
AV — day 2008, time 64, chronicles + 01697 37, daily 44, ever 18, year
14, continually 10, when 10, as 10, while 8, full 8 always 4, whole 4,
alway 4, misc 44
Note that while &quot;day&quot; is most common, a variety of time units can be
represented, definite or indefinite, bounded or continuous - in short
it means a period of time in which something is accomplished

Here are all the different kinds of usage that &quot;yowm&quot; receives in the
Bible, even for the literalist interpretation:
1) day, time, year

a) day (as opposed to night)

b) day (24 hour period)

1) as defined by evening and morning in Genesis 1

2) as a division of time

a) a working day, a day's journey

c) days, lifetime (pl.)

d) time, period (general)

e) year

f) temporal references

1) today

2) yesterday

3) tomorrow

We have no idea what those original intentions were.  Perhaps, for a
believer, the authors themselves had no idea of the original
intentions, if in some way God influenced them to write about things
that they did not understand.

If one posits an all-powerful God, one does not need a literal Bible,
and it would be silly for such a God to rely solely on the imperfect
nature of human language.

If one rejects an all-powerful God, then the Bible is just the
recordings of a bunch of people about what they and others thought
regarding God.

&quot;Must?&quot;  I don't require that anything &quot;must&quot; be some way.  For the
purpose of science, Jesus Christ is irrelevant.  For the purpose of
religious thought in the Christian cultural genre, He is not.

Miracles are by definition outside of science.  They don't conflict
with science at all.  They aren't repeatable and involve supernatural
forces.

Miracles could have happened 2000 years ago, with utterly no impact on
what we observe with science today.  Genesis could not have happened
literally as described because unless God engaged in some sort of
cover-up, the things described would have left traces that could be
detected.

Miracles might happen.  If a scientist ever observe something entirely
unexplainable by natural laws, the scientist will have to deal with
it.  I am not likely to witness any resurrections in my lifetime.  If
I do, I will cope.

&gt;&gt; &gt; come into being via secondary causes:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Where, then, were they [plants, when they were created]? Were they in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the earth in the &quot;reasons&quot; or causes from which they would spring, as
&gt;&gt; &gt; all things already exist in their seeds before they evolve [develop -
&gt;&gt; &gt; JSW] in one form or another and grow into their proper kinds in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; course of time? ... it appears [from Scripture - JSW] ... that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; seeds
&gt;&gt; &gt; sprang from the crops and trees, and that the crops and trees
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves
&gt;&gt; &gt; came forth not from seeds but from the earth.&quot; [De Genesi Ad Litteram,
&gt;&gt; &gt; (The literal meaning of Genesis) c. 390 AD, Book V, chapt 4 (Augustine

What I do see is an unchanging account of Creation given by God's Holy Word.
And it has withstood what were considered at various times in history
smoking gun evidence that one must believe in &quot;millions of years&quot; and thereby
reject God's account of His creation to be &quot;intellectually relevant&quot;.

Evolution theory, however, keeps getting exposed for it's fundamental flaw,
(Hey, I know, Maybe Space Aliens brought life to earth! Yeah Yeah That's
the ticket! Touche you pesky Christians!) then modified to fit the new
problematic evidence and then becomes
&quot;exactly what we'd expect if evolution were true! See! Told Ya!&quot;.
All the while, presenting a facade that the
theory and evidence are well-in-hand, rejecting any negative criticism to
the theory, relying on made-up evidence and such like artistic imaginations of
illustrationists of evolutionary make-believe (e.g. embryos,
Nebraska Man, etc.), acting as if they have something to hide.
Wanting so badly for it to be true, but alas &quot;the invisible things of him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that
they are without excuse&quot;.

But then evolutionary biology is akin to a social science in it's
(non)rigor and (non)subjection to falsifiability. Remarkable that a lawyer
was able to turn the field inside out through his book &quot;Darwin On Trial&quot;.
But then that's really the nature of the field anyway: Reject the opposing
side's argument no matter how valid because there's nothing to be gained by
your side in accepting the plain truth. Just like you all have something
to hide...
&quot;For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
whether it be good, or whether it be evil.&quot;[Ec 12:14]

And a terrifying thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God.

On the contrary, critique by people who actually have a clue what they

I have been a Christian in the hands of the living God for years, and

You don't actually READ anything about contemporary research
in evolution, do you?

Tell you what: go off and read anything that (quite respected)
biologist Lynn Marguilis writes these days about the neo-Darwinian
synthesis,

Then you can come back and apologize for having committed so
uninformed a statement.

And that's just the first example.  Want some more?  Shall
we discuss punctuated equilibrium vs. Darwin's picture,
or the rather amazing current developments an devo-evo,
or the theory of &quot;genomic capture&quot;, or any number of
other current topics which threaten to greatly revise
the neo-Darwinian /ynthesis?

Sweet Bast, man, have you actually ever READ any Johnson?  I have.
He argues exactly like a good defense attorney argues -- not, heaven
forfend, to get at the truth of the matter, but to create doubt
