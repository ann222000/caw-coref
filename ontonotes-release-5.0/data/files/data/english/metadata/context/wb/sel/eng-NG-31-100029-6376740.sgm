Mortgage Arrears And Repossession Guide -- How To Prevent Repossession
Copyright (c) 2007 James Copper

People in today's society will have differing attitudes to debt
and debt repayment. There will always be those individual's who
take a very relaxed attitude to debt and debt repayment, however
the vast majority will take the matter very seriously and in the
case of property ownership, they will take any realistic action
to make their mortgage repayments on time.

With the recent rises in the interest rates many people are going
to struggle to keep up with their repayments. Individuals fall
into arrears on their mortgage for many different reasons;
accident or sickness, redundancy or unemployment, death of a
spouse, insolvency or hikes in mortgage interest rates to name
just a few. The most common reason for property repossession in
current times can be attributed to general high levels of
consumer debt. This comes in two forms, secured and unsecured
debt. Whether this is due to the borrower making payments on
their unsecured debts in priority over their mortgage or a level
of mortgage borrowing taken out which their income cannot
afford.

But how can a few missed payments on the mortgage lead to
property repossession? Very rarely will a property be repossessed
over an isolated incident of a couple of missed payments. The
advice given to borrowers who fall behind on their mortgage
repayments is to contact their lender at the earliest possible
opportunity. Speedy action on the part of the borrower can often
reduce the potential arrears and put them on the road to
recovery. Delaying action is likely to result in increased
mortgage arrears and ultimately could lead to property
repossession.

Stage 1: Lender chases for missed payments.

Initially your lender(s) will contact you in writing or by
telephone to chase for missed payments. Make sure you speak to
your lender, and let them know what is going on, keep notes of
conversations and get details of any new agreements you reach.

Stage 2: Lenders solicitor contacts you.

If the arrears remain unpaid for a few months or more, your
lender will refer your case to their solicitors to deal with.

You will need to talk to the solicitors and try and come to some
arrangement, remember to get everything in writing from them.

Stage 3: Repossession Proceedings

Generally after around 4 - 8 months or more of mortgage arrears,
the lenders solicitors will issue Repossession Proceedings with
the County Court. Once the court has received this instruction, a
hearing date will be set.

If this happens, you must complete and return the Court summons.
Complete the reply form received from the Court stating your
intentions e.g. that you wish to remain at the property. Include
as much detail as possible about your income and outgoings as the
court will require evidence that you can meet the current monthly
installment and an amount towards the arrears.

Contact your lender and offer to pay the full regular monthly
payment for the month together with a contribution towards the
arrears. They may agree to suspended proceedings on receipt of
these payments, provided they are received before the hearing
date.

Make sure you attend the hearing. If you do not attend, the court
has almost no alternative but to order possession against you.

Offer to pay the current installment. If the court is satisfied
that you can maintain the repayments, the Judge will grant a
Suspended Order for Possession enabling you to stay in your
home.

Stage 4: Court Order

If you wish to remain in your home make an offer to pay the
current regular monthly payment together with an contribution
towards the arrears. If the judge believes you can maintain this
then a Suspended Possession Order will be granted enabling you to
stay in your home.

There are a number of possible outcomes at the hearing, depending
on your situation and circumstances of the case:

* Case dismissed. This means the repossession has been stopped
(i.e. the mortgage arrears have been paid off).

* Case adjourned. If for some reason the hearing cannot proceed
then a new hearing date will be set.

* Suspended Possession Order. This means that if the current
regular monthly payment is made, together with an agreed amount
towards the arrears each month the possession order is suspended.
If however you default on the agreed terms of payment, the lender
has the right to seek possession by Eviction or Possession
Warrant without a further hearing. So make sure you keep up the
repayments.

* Possession Order. This is where your lender has been granted
the right to possession of the property. This outcome is common
where the judge has seen no attempt by you to make contact with
the lender, the lenders solicitor or the courts, or where the
judge deals that you simply cannot afford to meet regular
payments or make a reasonable contribution to paying off the
arrears.

Stage 5: Possession Warrant or Eviction Notice

If you have defaulted on a Suspended Possession Order or are
still in your property after your Possession Order date, the
lender will apply to the court for formal eviction. You will
receive a letter from the court showing the exact date and time
by which you must have left the property. This is often 7 to 14
days from date that the eviction notice is granted.

At the notified date and time, a court bailiff, representative of
the lender and a locksmith will arrive at your property to
formally take back control and possession of the property. You
will have 10 minutes to collect your belongings and leave.
Generally, after 10 minutes the locks will be changed and you
will be allowed one further visit to collect any remaining
belongings after approximately 2 weeks.

It does not matter if you are elderly, sick or have a young
family the bailiffs will still take your property.

The Options You Have.

There are a number of things you can do in order to save your
property, these are.

* Negotiate revised terms.

* Pay the arrears off in full.

* Remortgage and switch lenders.

* Sell your property.

* Sell your property and rent it back.

The main thing to remember when being faced with repossession is
not to bury your head in the sand, but face up to your situation
and take action, answer your phone, read the letters from the
lender, contact the lender, etc. You can rectify the problem but
you do need to act quickly. Generally a bad credit remortgage
will be the best way to stop the repossession, providing you have
enough equity in the house.
