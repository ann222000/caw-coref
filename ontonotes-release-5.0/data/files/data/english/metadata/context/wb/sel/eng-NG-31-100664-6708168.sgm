Just incase a Marine here in Hawaii wants to do me in, I got a
spinning sword that can shield me from bullets as I advance into his
direction.. Like I said, Lee Harvey Oswald was a piece of work.. He
knew how to ricochet bullets to hit his target.. Sargeant Gunnery
speaks proudly of Oswald..  For the bigger marines you need explosive
tipped bullets or rhino bullets so as they come charging they blow up
with the loud noise of metal bending and sht.. I was in ROTC doing my
pivoting, marches, and making use of the rifle on the uppermost part
of the Campus.  I couldn't even nick the paper.. I mean the paper has
a layer of bullseyes, but I would entirely miss.  If I had that rifle
in campus would I be playing Doom at this point?  Fuck, yeah.. I would
not only go for the instructor of ROTC I would mow down Bj and
Nyugen..I would hit Vince on his kneecaps so he bows down in pain.. I
would even attempt to defeat Bowers as other ROTC members with
ammunition attempt to disable me by shooting me on the leg.. while I
go head on and shoot them in their heads rendering them useless
vegetables dying with life sustaining devices.. The most noble thing
that was witnessed in Punahou was when Vince used the rifle like he
was 10,000 lbs of pure titanium.. it was fkcking analog and sht.. his
charisma was up in the stars and sht.. but I could dismantle his
charisma by firing it in his leg and his teeth.. then I'll get two
syringes filled with heroine and sneak behind Jody to inject a lethal
amount on both sides of his body simulataneously.. chances are he'll
live, but who wants to live after that?  anyways, I'm gonna meet
Meghan again tomorrow.. I like her presence because you feel somewhat
at peace of mind when she's around.. She says she reads VC Andrews,
but I've heard complaints about VC Andrews.. Clive Barker is great,
but after reading the book Everville, I discovered it was an attempt
to put in diseases into my head..the illustration on the front cover
says it all... so I wonder if Coin locker Babies makes your coins fall
out of the place in which you sealed it with buttons..it's worth a
try.. perhaps in that is the cure.. ironically..
