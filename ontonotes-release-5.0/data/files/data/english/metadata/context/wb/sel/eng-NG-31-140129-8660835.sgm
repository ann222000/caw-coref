IRVING, Texas -- It was only the middle of the second quarter, and the Broncos
were already basted by a combination of a steamy North Texas night and the
sizzling Dallas Cowboys.

Then, injuries slapped the Broncos with a vicious one-two set of haymakers that
rendered the eventual final score and the circumstances therein relatively
irrelevant by comparison.

The 31-20 final score in the Cowboys' favor reflected a game that saw Dallas'
first-teamers get the better of the Broncos' first line, with Dallas amassing a
24-6 edge when it was No. 1 versus No. 1 until the final seconds of the first
half.

&quot;They performed much better than we did in all phases,&quot; Head Coach Mike
Shanahan, later adding, &quot;Collectively, we didn't play that well.&quot;

But amidst all the priorities of a preseason game -- player evaluation,
implementation of schemes, and, yes, winning -- a team's most vital goal emerge
from such a game without injuries -- a task that is completely beyond one's
control. And the story of the game became the fact that the Broncos limped back
to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and their awaiting charter flight
with a crucial cog in their defensive line lost for the year and their starting
running back awaiting an MRI examination on his left knee.

For running back Travis Henry, the tenor was optimistic. He was diagnosed with a
sprained left medial collateral ligament, although he will undergo the MRI just
to be certain.

&quot;That's what we think at this time,&quot; Shanahan said. &quot;I think he might be ready
for (next) week's preseason game (against Cleveland) if it's a first-degree MCL
(sprain). If it's not, and it's more serious than anticipated, then we'll talk
about it.&quot;

But for Ebenezer Ekuban, the news was devastating -- a torn right Achilles
tendon that likely brings a premature and heartbreaking end to a season that
seemed filled with promise for the nine-year veteran.

&quot;It's really a shame to lose Ebenezer for a year. He's a great leader for us,&quot;
Shanahan said. &quot;He's done everything we've asked him to do, and it's just a
shame he's got to go in the preseason game.&quot;

Through the offseason and training camp, Ekuban worked his way into a critical
role on the defensive line, not only serving as a first-team defensive end, but
as a defensive tackle in pass-rush situations. He seemed poised to be the
bulwark of the defensive front.

&quot;That's crucial. That's huge,&quot; safety Nick Ferguson said. &quot;We're already trying
to establish ourselves as a pass-rushing team and sacks and all that stuff.&quot;

&quot;He was playing outside and inside,&quot; safety John Lynch said. &quot;He was going to be
a key contributor.&quot;

All that dissolved less than seven minutes into the second quarter when he fell
to the ground as Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Tony
Curtis.

From there, the Broncos were left to pick up the pieces without the former
Cowboys first-round pick.

ON THE FIELD

Perhaps nowhere was the discrepancy between the two teams' No. 1 units borne out
more than on third downs. In the first half, the Cowboys converted six of eight
third-down tries, allowing them to control the game's pace and flow.

&quot;We've got to pick that up,&quot; cornerback Champ Bailey said.

&quot;This wasn't good. We felt like we really came down here and had two good days
of work and practiced really well. But you've got to take that into the game,&quot;
Lynch said.

When it was first team against first team, the Cowboys amassed startling
advantages is first downs (15-4), total yardage (219-78), rushing yardage
(97-22) and passing yardage (122-56).

&quot;We would really like to move the ball better, to get drives sustained, and we
didn't do that,&quot; said tight end Nate Jackson, who made his second consecutive
start as the Broncos once again opened in a two-tight end formation. &quot;But we'll
be all right.&quot;

&quot;(The Cowboys) blitzed a lot and brought some pressure, but we had a good week
against these guys and we can't take that for granted,&quot; quarterback Jay Cutler
said. &quot;We had good two-a-day practices out there and got better.

&quot;We just have to learn from this experience and get back to work.&quot;

In spite of the statistical discrepancies, takeaways managed to keep the Broncos
within shouting distance.  Denver did not force a first-half punt from the
Cowboys but did seize an interception and a fumble to set up a pair of Jason
Elam field goals.

A Denver turnover, however, set up one of Dallas' three first-half touchdowns.
Henry lost the handle on a handoff from Cutler and Marcus Spears recovered at
the Denver 7. Two plays later, Julius Jones plunged over the goal line from four
yards out, putting the Broncos into a 14-0 hole.

Denver rallied thanks to the two takeaways, but the offense came away frustrated
after being turned away in the red zone.  Of particular consternation was the
goal-to-go sequence during which Henry was injured, particularly a
third-and-goal pass play that saw Cutler roll right and throw in the direction
of Jackson and Chad Mustard.  However, neither came down with the football.

&quot;That's an area we need to improve on,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;That's an area of
emphasis in which we were inconsistent last year, so to stall again on the goal
line -- it sucks for us, but we'll get it right.&quot;

When the second-teamers took the stage in the second half, the Broncos began to
find their footing. After converting its first third-down try of the game via an
11-yard, third-and-4 Patrick Ramsey pass to Brian Clark, the Broncos offense
finally found the end zone two plays later when the two hooked up on a 90-yard
touchdown catch-and-run.

The score, which game with 1:05 left in the third quarter, came when Clark got
separation from Nathan Jones as the two exchanged downfield shoves. Clark then
found just enough room to make the grab of Ramsey's deep pass, then shifted into
overdrive and sprinted away from everyone else for the score.

Denver also scored on its next possession, as a pass-interference penalty drawn
by Domenik Hixon moved the Broncos into a goal-to-go situation that Ramsey
converted into a 5-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Morgan. However, a Brad
Johnson-to-Isaiah Stanback 15-yard touchdown connection was sandwiched in
between the two Broncos scores, keeping the Broncos in an 11-point deficit at
31-20 midway through the final period.

After forcing a punt, the Broncos had a chance to further narrow the deficit
with Darrell Hackney taking over at quarterback, but Dallas' Bobby Carpenter
intercepted him on a fourth-and-1 play, effectively ending Denver's chances of a
late-game comeback.

DEFENSIVELY SPEAKING:

In the locker room, many of the inquisitors in the mic-and-laptop set wondered
about the state of the first-team defense after it surrendered 24 points and 219
yards to the Cowboys before halftime. In approximately three quarters of work
this preseason, the No. 1 defense has surrendered 34 points and has not forced a
punt, although it did notch a pair of takeaways Saturday evening.

But as some of its veterans cautioned -- the coverage schemes and calls were
basic, emphasizing the development of core fundamentals rather than complex
strategies.

&quot;We didn't game plan. We had two coverages and two fronts,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;(The
Cowboys) blitzed every play.

&quot;I think sometimes you can panic and say, 'We've got to throw the kitchen sink
at them.' That's not what we're doing right now. We're trying to build a
foundation. It doesn't always look pretty when you do that, but we've got to
stick to our guns, and we'll just have a real good week of practice and come
home and hopefully represent ourselves a lot better against Cleveland.&quot;

Sense of urgency -- absolutely. Sense of panic -- absolutely not.

&quot;I'm not really worried,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;If it was the last preseason game and we
played like that I'd definitely be concerned, but we've got a good little bit of
time before Week 1, and we've got time to make it up.&quot;

But not much time.

&quot;We've got to speed up the learning curve, because we've only got 21 days until
Buffalo,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;It's a work in progress, but we've got to speed that work
up and we've got to get there.&quot;

After watching the game on NFLN, and looking at the stats, here's a question for
the Bronco masses:
Any chance of a QB controversy arising before the regular season?  So far,
Ramsey seems to be outperforming Cutler.

Not if Cutler is healthy.

Ramsey hasn't played against the opposing teams' best defenses.

Ya just never know @ PRE-season -- could be Shanny was trying a few
&lt;new&gt; wrinkles in the Offense - might be looking MORE @ WR's than
QB's....etc

On Defense, welcome to the Bates Motel.  Ekuban injury aside, I am sure
Dallas was used as a tool to determine where the Defense stands/needs
work.

And with cut time soon, probably 3-4-5 players Bronco staff was REALLY
looking at.

or more...lol

Glad Ramsey did well though -- shows he is INTERESTED in being a Bronco.
