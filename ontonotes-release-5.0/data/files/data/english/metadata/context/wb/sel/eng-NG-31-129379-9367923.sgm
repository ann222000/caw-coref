After seeing the posts on BGG, I just had a look in the new TK Maxx in
Portsmouth town centre. I got Mensa Connections for £7 as I enjoyed
that when we played it once.

They also have Colossal Arena for £6 which I already have but highly
recommend it to anyone who hasn't. It's great for 2 or 3 players but
feels out of control with more.

I'm sure there was another Knizia game but the name eludes me so it
can't have been very interesting. Other than that, they have the usual
stuff - Lost, DVD games, murder mysteries. I'll have another look in a
week or two as I hear they have different things in all the time.

Excellent! Perhaps they'll get in some of those Heroscape expansions
people have been talking about - I got LOTR Risk from the one in
Waterlooville a while back, and I have seen LOTR the confrontation
there, although I didn't purchase that one. Will definitely check out
Colossal Arena...

Excuse my ignorance, but is TK Maxx a card holder only type store?
Not sure I have ever been into one.

No, Rob, TK Maxx is open to all - are you thinking about Makro?

Checked out Waterlooville TK Maxx and they had the following:

Heroscape master set - £14.99
Mensa Connections (Knizia) - £6.99
Minotaur Lords (Knizia) - £4.99
Beowulf (FF/Knizia) - £9.99
Apples to apples - £5.99
LOTR Risk - £9.99

Some of the games were upstairs in the men's gadgets section. Didn't
get any games as Harriet would kill me if I bought any more...

I just got Perikles from the Portsmouth TK Maxx for a tenner! I didn't
really know anything about it but saw it mentioned a few times on BGG
so went for it. It looks really cool - a mixture of politics and war.

Don't know too much about Perikles though reports on BGG make it seem
ok.  Well it is a Martin Wallace design so it won't be a bad game. I
thought about trying the Southampton branch after work one day but
didn't get round to it.

I've kinda got ancient warfare covered with Command &amp; Colors:
Ancients, Pax Romana, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, and a pre-order for
The Republic Of Rome.  Ancient warfare kicks ass.  :)

Mine is in Oz !!!

Not sure what the exchange rate is but I bet its not as good as the almighty
$$$.

I need to look on his wish list, but I wonder if he has Australia, and there
is always room for another convict game :-)
