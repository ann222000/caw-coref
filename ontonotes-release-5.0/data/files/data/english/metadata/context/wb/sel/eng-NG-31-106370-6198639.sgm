hey I have a question/story... I have been getting paychecks from my
fathers company to be put into a college fund, I believe $307 weekly,
since the end of july 2007.  since that time I have come to find that
none of the paychecks were cashed into the bank (they were left
sitting on the counter in my house). I recently have had issues with
them over the past couple weeks and was kicked out :(... I inquired
about the money that ive been getting (note: I dont really do anything
for the company, it was a tax break for my dad and a college fund for
me) they said that the checks were gone, or "put back into the
company"... my question is A: is that legal?, B: am I rightfully
entitled to that money (they were written out to me by a payroll
company).. and C: is there anything I can do about it, Im 18 and live
in NJ... any thoughts or comments would be great thanks!

I dunno if you are entitled to the checks but you are probably be
entitled to having your name on the indictment for income tax fraud.  Do
nothing jobs of family members are highly frowned upon by the IRS.

Yeah, since it's accounting fraud, you can report it to the
authorities,
the IRS, and whatever State agency governs CPA's if the payroll
company
or your father's accountant were certified public accounts.

You will however not see any of the $$, just rain torment upon your
father and his company.

If you want to cause your dad some sh*t for kicking you out, you can
always report this little deal you had to the IRS.
