The New York Times gave the Abbu Graheb Prison scandel 63 days of
front page news coverage - 30 days in a row at one stretch.

The New York Times gave Terror War Hero, Michael Murphy ZERO (0) days
of front page news coverage for his being awarded the only
CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR, The United States' highest military
honor for his brave deeds in the War on Terror.

Murphy was  a suburban New York citzen.

The New York Times placed Murphy and his nation's highest award in the
local Metro section.

ill O'Reilly has taken his media attacks to a destructive level in the
last two days. This time he's calling the media, particularly CNN and
MSNBC, anti-American claiming they ignored the the heroism of Lt
Michael Murphy who was awarded the Medal of Honor. When Dennis Miller
joined him last night,10/24, O'Reilly placed himself and FOX on a
patriotic pedestal and Miller jumped right in with his stream of
venomous support. However , it turns out that O'Reilly lied about CNN
and MSNBC ignoring Lt Michael Murphy.

Media Matters reports that CNN and MSNBC did not ignore Lt Murphy,
MSNBC reported the story five separate times and carried the ceremony
live and CNN covered it on seven occasions.

O'Reilly made sure to note that CNN and MSNBC didn't cover the story
in &quot;primetime&quot; which was true but failed to mention all the coverage
so his viewers would believe they blacked out the
story. This is how he framed it.

&quot;Last night our lead story was the Medal of Honor awarded to Navy Lt.
Michael Murphy, who was killed in Afghanistan trying to save his unit.
Lt. Murphy's bravery is truly an incredible saga, so why did CNN and
MSNBC fail to report the story in prime time last night? CBS News gave
Lt. Murphy more than three minutes, ABC more than two minutes. But
apparently Lt. Murphy was not ready for prime time on our cable
competition. The hard truth is that MSNBC and CNN are not going to
report stories that reflect well on the American military because they
despise the Bush administration and believe anything positive detracts
from their negative assessment.&quot;

After a self serving rant about his great ratings and all around
superiority he attacked viciously.

&quot;I don't want to hear CNN or MSNBC say they 'support the troops.' CNN
and NBC News can't get enough of negative war zone stories, but on
their prime time broadcasts last night, CNN and MSNBC said 'no' to Lt.
Michael Murphy and his proud family. There is no excuse.&quot;

Last night, 10/24/07, he continued harping to Dennis Miller. He
claimed that FOX is accused of &quot; shilling for the Republican Party&quot;
but we believe this is &quot; a noble country&quot; and we give it the &quot; benefit
of the doubt&quot;. Miller got carried away claiming that's why the troops
only watch FOX. (In fact the troops have no choice since FOX is the
only network shown.) Then Miller made some silly comment about &quot; Fox
holes&quot;. Was he actually suggesting this term was connected to the
network?

comment: I am repulsed by the idea that Bill O'Reilly continues these
nightly claims about everyone ignoring and disrespecting the troops
while knowing that they're all watching the show. If he really gave a
damn about them, he would want them to feel supported and appreciated.
He would keep his divisive, angry, anti-American crapola to himself if
he really cared. Bill O'Reilly's success depends on a divided country
and he's going to do whatever it takes to keep it that way even if he
demoralizes our troops in the process.

O'Reilly stated the truth:

Many occasions Michael  Miler was mentioned - But not- and he made it
VERY clear during Prime Time News periods - 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
when most of the people are watching.

For ONE day it should have been the pri,me news story.

The One And Only Congressional Medal Of Honor Of The War On Terror.

What is your response to New York Times 63 Abhu Grahib stories and 0
Front page Michael Miller stories???

You seem to be forgetting the rest of the networks' &quot;Hate Bush-Hate
America agenda.&quot;

I don't read the NYT on any sort of regular basis, but, I see no
reason why Murphy shouldn't have had some recognition beyond the local
metro page.

You assume too much with your hate bush hate America agenda. Why so
paranoid? O'Reilly, like Rush, is an entertainer. And no, he's not
really looking out for you, he's looking out for his ratings and
advertisers.
