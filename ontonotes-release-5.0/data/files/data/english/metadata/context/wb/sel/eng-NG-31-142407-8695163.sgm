Groups Again
U.S. House Democrat Said Pro-Israel Lobby Promoted War

By Amy Gardner

Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.) has again come under fire from local Jewish
organizations for remarking in a magazine interview that the &quot;extraordinarily powerful&quot;
pro-Israel lobby played a strong role promoting the war in Iraq.

In an interview with Tikkun, a California-based Jewish magazine, Moran said the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is &quot;the most powerful lobby and has pushed this
war from the beginning. I don't think they represent the mainstream of American Jewish
thinking at all, but because they are so well organized, and their members are
extraordinarily powerful - most of them are quite wealthy - they have been able to exert
power.&quot;

Moran's remarks were criticized by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater
Washington and the National Jewish Democratic Council. Ronald Halber, executive director
of the first group, said Moran's remarks are anti-Semitic and draw on ugly stereotypes
about Jewish wealth, power and influence.

&quot;He uses several age-old canards that have been used throughout history that have
brought violence upon Jews,&quot; Halber said this week. &quot;He uses clearly anti-Semitic images
such as Jewish control of the media and wealthy Jews using their wealth to control
policy.&quot;

Ira N. Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said in a
published statement that there is nothing wrong with criticizing the pro-Israel lobby
but that Moran's statements go beyond that to defamation by making a &quot;phony&quot; connection
between AIPAC and the Iraq war.

&quot;Rep. Moran's comments are not only incorrect and irresponsible,&quot; Forman said. &quot;They are
downright dangerous.&quot;

In an interview last night, Moran said he was dismayed at the reaction to his remarks,
which he stands by. The pro-Israel lobby has not represented mainstream U.S. Jewish
opinion in recent years, he said - most notably with its Middle East policies, which he
characterized as directly aligned with those of the Bush administration.

&quot;The problem with addressing the groups who have argued strongly in favor of a long-term
American military presence in the Middle East is that they raise arguments that are not
related to the point,&quot; Moran said. &quot;I would like to have a reasonable, objective
discussion about AIPAC's foreign policy agenda. But it's difficult to do that because
any time you question their motives, you are accused of being anti-Semitic.&quot;

&lt; http://www.davidduke.com/images/tikkun-cover.jpg &gt; Representative Jim Moran on the
Power of AIPAC

TIKKUN: What do you think the reasoning is for the Democrats who voted against the
amendment requiring that the president get authorization from Congress before attacking
Iran?

MORAN: Well, AIPAC strongly opposed it. In fact, Rep. Murtha, Rep. Obey, and myself
wanted it in the supplemental. We had it in and then the leadership had to take it out
because AIPAC was having a conference in Washington, and insisted with the leadership
and many of the members with whom they have close alliances. Yesterday, AIPAC had an
amendment to recommit the whole Armed Services Bill in order to add language requiring
America to develop missile defenses jointly with Israel, to share all its missile
defense technology with Israel. That passed overwhelmingly. There were only thirty
members-that's less than 10 percent-who voted against sharing all our missile technology
with Israel. It received about 400 votes in favor of it. I was one of the thirty. My
feeling was that it wasn't just the incendiary language that Israel is under immediate
attack and we need to protect it from another Holocaust, it was also the idea that the
solution to Israel's security is a militaristic one. I would urge you to read the
Congressional record for the debate on the recommital. It put our loyalty to Israel in
terms of complete military support. My feeling is that both America and Israel have
acted in counterproductive fashion and have undermined their security by focusing
exclusively on military capability.

That was a key vote yesterday. It was phrased by many as an &quot;AIPAC vote.&quot; As a result,
it prevailed approximately 400 to thirty.

TIKKUN: In your estimation, how does AIPAC get that power?

MORAN: AIPAC is very well organized. The members are willing to be very generous with
their personal wealth. But it's a two edged sword. If you cross AIPAC, AIPAC is
unforgiving and will destroy you politically. Their means of communications, their ties
to certain newspapers and magazines, and individuals in the media are substantial and
intimidating. Every member knows it's the best-organized national lobbying force. The
National Rifle Association comes a close second, but AIPAC can rightfully brag that
they're the most powerful lobbying force in the world today. Certainly they are in the
United States. Not in Europe, obviously. Most people that are involved in foreign policy
especially look at a broad range of issues and consider a person's entire voting record.
AIPAC considers the voting record only as it applies to Israel.

TIKKUN: Where is the national interest, then? What happens to those who think that the
best interest of the United States is to live in peace with the world? Certainly the
American people feel a very strong revulsion towards this war in Iraq. Why doesn't that
translate into policy?

MORAN: You've touched on a quandary, and it particularly applies to the Jewish American
community. Jewish Americans, as a voting bloc and as an influence on American foreign
policy, are overwhelmingly opposed to the war. There is no ethnic group as opposed to
the war as much as Jewish Americans. But, AIPAC is the most powerful lobby and has
pushed this war from the beginning. I don't think they represent the mainstream of
American Jewish thinking at all, but because they are so well organized, and their
members are extraordinarily powerful-most of them are quite wealthy-they have been able
to exert power.

The reason I don't hesitate to speak out about AIPAC's influence-notwithstanding the
fact that I'll be accused of being anti-Semitic every time I suggest it-is that I don't
think AIPAC represents the mainstream of American Jewish thinking. I think that, in
fact, if you were to sit down with Jewish families in the United States, far more would
agree with your philosophy of reconciliation, in acting in a manner consistent with
Torah, and they believe in tikkun. AIPAC doesn't believe in tikkun, judging from their
policy proposals, but nevertheless, they have the Congress pretty. well [pause]
&quot;controlled&quot; may be too strong a word, but their influence is dominant in the
Congress-and their attitude is the opposite of Tikkun's and the NSP's. They support
domination: not healing. They feel that you acquire security through military force,
through intimidation, even through occupation, when necessary, and that if you have
people who are hostile toward you, it's OK to kill them, rather than talk with them,
negotiate with them, try to understand them, and ultimately try to love them. That's
what Tikkun and the NSP is all about: healing, mending, reconciling, understanding, and
love, which is why I think you are on the right path.

And yet the Congress seems to be going in the opposite direction, investing more money
in the military than we invest in anything else, to dominate the world through our
military, to impose our foreign policy through our military, to deal with all our
security threats in a militaristic manner. It is a profound difference, and what you are
suggesting through your magazine, and through your philosophy, is wholly at odds with
the foreign policy and defense policy that we are implementing. This Administration is
more militaristic than the Congress itself. My own personal view is that's run by the
people who don't have the courage to stand up and be gentle and express the goodness of
people. They strut on the world stage, suggesting that nobody can mess with them because
they're all-powerful. Of course, they gain their strength through the use and abuse of
soldiers and military families that support them.

TIKKUN: Have you heard anybody in the Democratic Caucus present a scenario trying to
convince other members of the caucus about why a strike at Iran would be a rational
policy for either country?

MORAN: A strike at Iran is argued as necessary because of Iran's potential threat to
Israel. No one's suggested that Iran is a potential threat to the United States, any
more than Iraq could ever have been a threat to the United States. It's a threat to our
ally, and those in the Likud Party, and AIPAC, who agree pretty consistently with Likud,
feel that the best way to eliminate a threat is to destroy it, and they want America to
use its military might to eliminate that threat.

TIKKUN: Are there people who say that in the Democratic Caucus? In a meeting where
you're sitting together and saying &quot;How do we vote on a bill to prevent the president
from making war with Iran without having authorization from us?&quot;

MORAN: Normally it's said in somewhat veiled language. If you look at the debate that
took place even yesterday, you can see language that pretty much says the same thing in
the words of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen or Duncan Hunter or Tom Lantos. Tom Lantos has
moderated his views somewhat. Mark Kirk introduced the resolution on Iran.

They make it clear that we should be prepared to enter into military conflict with Iran.
There are several debates that took place on the issue yesterday. I'm sure you could get
in online at the Congressional Record. May 16th and May 17th. You'll find the debate,
and you'll find what's being said is quite striking with regard to America's need to be
prepared for a military confrontation with Iran, notwithstanding that it's 70 million
people, that it used to be an ally, that it was a strong democracy until they elected
Mohammed Mossadegh. Mossadegh wanted to nationalize the oil revenue, because most of the
profit was being given to the American and British interests instead of the Iranian
interests. So the British and the Americans had him executed and then imposed the Shah
of Iran who imposed a philosophy that we liked. But did so with oppressive tactics. This
caused the counter-reaction of the Ayatollah Khomeini coming in 1979 with the Iranian
revolution, and that's put the religious extremists in power.

America's had a direct role in Iran's fortunes, and we continue to believe that we can
tell Iran what to say and do. I personally take great umbrage at the way Iran treats
dissenters today. But that's a relatively small number of people in sensitive positions
in the religious and military factions. The majority of Iranians are very young-I think
almost two thirds are under the age of twenty-five years, so it's a very young
population-and most of them want to be liberated from this repressive religious regime
and be able to be part of a modern world. It's a very well educated population, and for
the vast majority of America's existence, Iran has been our ally. The present enmity
could be turned around if we could take an approach of negotiation, sound
reconciliation, and trying to find areas of agreement, instead of trying to emphasize
those areas of disagreement. Obviously, we need to protect Israel, but the more we
brandish swords and threaten Iran, ironically, the more of a threat Iran becomes to
Israel, because Israel is seen as a surrogate power of the United States. We are
inextricably tied since our policies are seen as identical. I think that the attitude
we're taking is entirely wrong; nevertheless, it's the reality, and we've got a long way
to go before the Congress would turn around and embrace the kind of approach that you
and a few other enlightened people are suggesting.
