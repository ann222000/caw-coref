Hi All,

I am having the hardest time of my life. This is just one of the
reasons I like old cars. I want to put new seats in my 72 Suburban. I want
the exact same seats that come in the new Chevy P/U because they have the
seatbelt all integrated in the seat system. Here is where the problem comes
in; I call the dealer and they do not know who males the seat so they tell
me to call 1 800-222-1020 (customer support) they tell me to call the
dealer. Does anyone know who makes the seats or who makes the same type of
seats that are in the 1999 -2001 Extra Cab Chevy's. They have a seat that
has the seatbelts all integrated in the seat. No drilling in the columns of
the truck no extra belts to get in the way when getting in the back just all
in one package.

Thanks for any help provided.

"/> Why not just go to the wrecking yard and find one that's been totalled.
Probably cheaper than a new set, and if they're from a new truck with
low miles, they're likely to be in good condition.

Not to mention not having to spend your time listening to others &quot;pass
the buck&quot;.

Well, if you have the money just walk into the dealer parts department and
ask for some seats for a 2001 pickup. There's a good chance they'll ream you
on the price though. It would likely be quite a bit cheaper to find a
wrecked truck with intact interior, though the junkyards probably know how
much interior parts are worth too..

Try a customizing shop, you know, the ones who take off the factory stuff
and install their own. If you don't have one close try information for
Norman Ok and ask for LWM enterprises, they sell all kinds of factory
takeoffs and new custom seats, wheels, etc..

I would bet that Johnson Controls Corp makes the seats. Various locations
across the country. They won't sell them to you outright, you can bet on
that (they are under contract).
But again you'll think you're buying half a new truck if you order them
through the dealer.
Go to the dealer and find out what they list for and figure 2/3 of that from
a junk yard. Seats are a valuable asset in the world of wrecked cars. Also
go to your local insurance agent and see if he gets a listing of salvaged
vehicles, may be able to buy the whole wreck for a little more then part out
what you don't need to pay for the seats. Scan the web for GSA sealed bid
sales in your area, I know here in the east we get to bid on NHTSA test
vehicles that have been rolled and crashed and have titles that you can't
rebuild, of course people don't want them unless they have a specific part
they need and that usually keeps the price down. Interiors are sometimes
good, although the bodies are pretty trashed.
