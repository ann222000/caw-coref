Art Deco Gem Victim of Acropolis Museum

ATHENS, Greece —  Greece's culture minister has angered architects and
conservationists by clearing the way for the demolition of a landmark
art deco building to improve the view from the new Acropolis museum.

George Voulgarakis revoked his ministry's protection of the 1930s
building, saying that tearing it down would &quot;allow an unimpeded view
of the Acropolis&quot; from the new museum. He also argued that excavating
the site could &quot;reveal antiquities whose existence is considered
highly likely.&quot;
The building's defenders have launched an international e-mail
campaign to save it, accusing the government of sacrificing Greece's
modern treasures to showcase its ancient history. Residents vowed to
challenge Wednesday's decision in court.

&quot;You have hundreds of people both in Greece and all over the world who
... appreciate the coexistence of early 20th century architecture and
this urban environment opposite the rock of the Acropolis and the
Parthenon,&quot; said architect Nikos Rousseas, whose office is in the
building.

The four-story building, with its pink marbled facade, stands about
300 yards from the Acropolis on a carefully landscaped pedestrian
street facing the ancient citadel's southern slopes. A mosaic of
Oedipus and the Sphinx adorn the top story, and marble statues of
women in traditional dress flank the wrought-iron door. It was
designed by Greek architect Vassilis Kouremenos, a Paris-trained
friend of Pablo Picasso.

Rousseas argued the art deco building serves as a link between the
ancient and modern, softening the impact of the large glass and
concrete museum. &quot;The mere existence of this building screens off the
otherwise huge, monumental volume of the 21st century museum,&quot; he
said.
A neighboring building is also set to be demolished. It's owned by
composer Vangelis Papathanassiou, who won an Academy Award for
creating the score for &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot;

The dispute over the two structures is overshadowing the opening of
the $179 million Acropolis museum, planned for early 2008 after a
delay of more than two decades.

Greece hopes the new museum will eventually display the Elgin Marbles
_ a collection of sculptures removed from the Parthenon in the early
19th century and currently housed in London's British Museum. The
British Museum has refused Greece's request to return the sculptures,
but a space awaits them in a gallery on the top floor of the new
museum.

Greece's Ministry of Public Works must still remove the buildings from
its own list of protected structures, although it was unlikely to
refuse after the Culture Ministry's decision.

But residents have not given up hope.

&quot;We are certain that, with broad popular support and the verdict of
our justice system, (the art deco building) will continue to embellish
our city for many years to come,&quot; residents said in a statement on a
blog devoted to the building's salvation.
