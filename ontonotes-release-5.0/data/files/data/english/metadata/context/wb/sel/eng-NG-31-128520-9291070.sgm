Hi Gang:

On one of Joe Pass's tapes he advocates spending most of your time
learning tunes.

His point was this ,once you learn how to play the various scales and
chord shapes,you need to apply this knowledge to the  tunes you would
actually play on a job.

I don't recall ever going on a gig and having the leader say,&quot;OK,guys,
we're going to play C7th &quot;, or &quot;We're going to play the  the melodic
minor scale  in D&quot;.

Another advantage of learning tunes is this;when you play the melody of
the tune,the melody itself will often force you out of your
favorite &quot;grips&quot; or chord positions,and this in itself will open up
other improvisational ideas that you would not normally use.

I really agree with this, I know numerous players
who cannot read or play a melody and spend their
performance times flying up and down modes. Then
when the number finally comes to an end they have
to do another 10 bars of solo &quot;Twiddle&quot;.

To quote from &quot;The bluffers guide to jazz guitar&quot;

Joe did say this, and, interestingly, his &quot;method&quot; book (&quot;Joe Pass
Guitar Style&quot;) does have quite a bit of scale work in it. I think that
his comment, often restated, was a reaction to the huge number of
musicians and study methods he came across which were very scale
oriented. It is true that many, many young musicians spend almost no
time learning tunes and listening to them as done by other musicians,
both of which are of paramount importance.

This topic is huge, but after all the words have been said, it all comes
down to a simple matter of balance.

best,
Bobby

Bobby:

Your comments remind me of Jeff Linsky's master
classes.

He'll hear a college student's solo on &quot;Stella by
Starlight&quot; or whatever, which almost invariably
incorporates what he or she has been taught - a lot of
formulaic scalar passages.
I've seen Jeff do this many times. He'll choose
another melody by name only and ask the student to
play it. This results in several reactions: 1) panic
2) &quot;What are the changes?&quot; adn/or 3) a valiant
attempt. The attempts often fall short because the
student has not had enough ear training.

Jeff is largely self taught, and it doesn't hurt that
he has a genius IQ. But even as a kid, he would give
himself assignments to play melodies cold. If he made
a mistake, he considered that an error as profound as
any technical glitch on the instrument. So the endgame
was not necessarily to play THAT melody again, but to
give himself another challenge until he could play a
tune by ear the first time he tried.

His parents divorced when he was quite young, and he
was a latchkey kid. Come home from school, lock the
door, wait for mom to come home from work, turn on
cartoons. He learned to play tunes on the guitar by
trying to play the theme from &quot;Little Lulu,&quot; &quot;Looney
Tunes,&quot; etc. Today, he can play fully-formed
arrangements as quickly as his mind can conjure them
up.

He has had very few lessons. He used to sneak in to
the Lighthouse club in LA, though he was underage. He
was &quot;adopted&quot; by Joe Pass, who gave him a few free
lessons at Joe's home. Not a bad pedigree.

Another mentor he mentions with fondness is Vicente
Gomez, the Spanish guitarist who was very active on
the studio scene in LA, though he was based in NYC.
Jeff played a very busy, convuluted, rather uptempo
version of &quot;Manha de Carnaval&quot; as his audition piece.
Gomez, without saying a word, took the guitar and
played a hauntingly beautiful, slower, far simpler,
and ultimately better version. It was a non-verbal
lesson Jeff never forgot. It's not all about the
notes. Every note played is not the equivalent of a
point scored in basketball. It's about WHICH notes,
and when, and where, and how, and why ...

I agree with this &quot;question of balance&quot;, Bob.

The pro will probably never stoop to play a scale in front of other
musicians during a gig, but probably had practice them anyway for an hour
before drinking his first orange juice in the morning...

Just my 1 cent and a half. Learning tunes WITH analysis (as far as
intermediate level is concerned) is certainly useful. But it is extremely
rare to find a method (or even a teacher) with extensive analysis of
standards or great guitarists tunes. I'd rather mix the 2 approaches, be
inspired by a melody and try to practice scales/arpeggios around this, but
not necessarily learn the tune just to reproduce it.

Maybe you never recall a band leader saying: &quot;Let's play the melodic minor
scale in D&quot;. But if this would happen, would you be able to play it in a
creative way? Yes if you're a pro, but have to practice it if your
intermediate.

Cheers,
Marc

From time to time, this subject comes up, and with strong opinions on
either side of the argument. Joe Pass, Carol Kaye, and others are right
when they comment that the tunes are where it's at, But, on the other
side, Heifetz was right also when he said &quot;scales, scales, scales&quot;, and
that's what his student auditions were all about.  At 100 years old,
Hubie Blake commented that he &quot;still plays my scales every day&quot;.

A player desirous of getting into a good school will indeed be tested on
his command of scales and arpeggios, and he'd better have them under no
little degree of control if he wants to get placed well, or possibly
even to get accepted at all. I've found, as a teacher, that I have to
place great weight on scales and arpeggios, because the student is
unlikely to get worked with them much after entering college, where he's
expected to already have them together. But I teach my students how to
best blend scale and arpeggio work with everything else he must do to
become a good musician and guitarist.

Tunes and other repertory pieces are so neglected by so many that it
becomes a huge problem which, for obvious reasons if a musician wants to
perform, must be addressed. What it all adds up to, of course, is more
practice on the part of the student - a well balanced mix of both, with,
ultimately, the repertoire receiving the greatest weight (not so much so
in the beginning). Those who take this to heart and put in the time are,
of course, the cream which rises to the top.

The topic is long, but all I wanted to do was generalize the philosophy
which I've found to work best for me and my students over the years. In
greater depth, it actually varies from student to student, dependent
upon their individual talents and specifics.

best,
Bobby

I think scales are a means to an end, which is playing jazz.  The  problem
is, &quot;too many scales make Juan a dull boy&quot;, ie, people end up relying on
scales, rather than using them as tools to play.  Even if there were no  scales,
there'd be tunes, and not the other way around.  Playing scales for  a musician
is like jumping rope is for a boxer; you never see a boxer jumping  rope in the
ring...

What balance have you arrived at that works for you?  I used to spend
80% of my practice time on scale and arpeggio practice and only 20% on
learning tunes.  That was a mistake.

I have made the most progress in my jazz studies by learning tunes and
not spending so much time on scale practice.  I practice the melody
and the chords until I memorize the tune, then I practice soloing over
the tune in my head while away from my instruments.

As some may recall I asked a question or two about Autumn Leaves that
sparked a long thread.  I could theoretically improvise over that tune
by practicing the Bb major/G minor scale repeatedly then playing notes
from that scale pattern on the fretboard.  But I would have failed to
achieve my goal, which is to compose a solo in my head and play on the
instrument what I hear in my head.  Instead, I would have let my
fingers do the talking for me.

I still follow the practice routine I have posted about in the past -
compose a line in my head, figure out how to play it, then play it.
Sometimes I come up with a line that fits a scale/mode or an arp.
Sometimes I come up with a line that does not (because it transitions
from one thing to another).  Either way, after I figure out a
fingering for the line, I practice it and _that_ is how I get some
technical practice out of this routine.  I record myself to keep
myself honest.  Here is my latest progress report, clams and all:
http://myspace.com/governorsilver (&quot;In Walked Bud Improv&quot;).

My current practice breakdown:

Working on a tune (melody, chords, bass lines) - 90%
Technical practice (mostly hybrid picking drills) - 10%

On the cello, the breakdown is a little different, because I need much
more work on my intonation, so I put in more practice time on modes:

Working on a tune - 70%
Technical practice (bowing, modes, plucking technique) - 30%

Chris asked, re: Jeff Linsky:

&lt;Do you mean he'll name another standard, or he'll
play one and ask the student to then reproduce it?

He'll name another tune, and not necessarily a jazz
standard. It could be something as banal as &quot;Three
Blind Mice.&quot; The purposes of the exercise are not to
embarrass the student, but rather to make several
points:

- When jamming with musicians, more often than not you
won't have chord charts to lean on
- You may be a sideman, you may be the lead
- And if you're playing a solo, a good solo guitar
piece contains all the elements of a small ensemble
arrangement - melody, harmony, bass, rhythm and
originality in putting the elemenets together.

What he finds missing in most of the intermediate to
advanced-level jazz guitar students he encounters is
the ability to play the melody ... right now.

Well, that's pretty understandable, considering guitarists tend to spend
more time learning changes, and then (whatever they use) to play solos.   Knowing
the melody to a tune is a very important part of knowing the tune, and  being
able to play it; if the song has lyrics, learn them too.  It helps in
remembering the song, and can also be helpful in providing some insights into  the
song's emotional message too.

But Heifetz is a non-improvising classical musician, is he not?  He
can put a lot more time into technical practice and zero time into
learning jazz tunes and working on his jazz improv over those tunes.

I have yet to hear about a _jazz_ authority who prioritizes scale
practice over tunes, at least more than 50% time allocation anyway.

Hi Bob , I really appreciate your advices.

Maybe I am completely off the track, but why isn't there a godd.. single
book entirely dedicated to 1 (or maybe 2) standard jazz tune (at least 100
pages, or so) with numerous examples of all (well, I know its infinite) the
(main) possible variations of improv solos, with analysis of the devices
used (passing tones, neighbouring tones, extensions, etc. etc.). And also
examples of &quot;wrong&quot; (or less satisfactory) solos and explanations as to how
avoiding them.

And with TABS and solons on CD/DVD please!

Where in my post did I ever &quot;invoke&quot; his name as an authority on the
subject of jazz improvisation? You're just looking for an argument, and
I'm not buying. Look, &quot;classical&quot; musicians have their repertoire, jazz
musicians have theirs. Rock &amp; blues musicians have theirs too, as do
country, ska, and punk musicians, and they all have their nuances. All,
even &quot;classical&quot; musicians do, in fact, improvise, whether or not you
are aware of it; just differently, as the expectations of the genre are
different.

The broad scope of the question, as I see it, is whether or not a
practice regiment of scales and arpeggios is a means to the end of
achievement of good musicianship. Of and by themselves, they are not.
They are tools, and must be incorporated into a well balanced program
which includes many, many disciplines, paramount of which is the proper
learning of the repertoire esoteric to the genre, to be of value.

When a particular piece (or style) of music is broken down and analyzed
for its components, what is shared in all of Western music is, among
other things, that of scales and arpeggios, and the theories of
counterpoint and tonality of which they help to define over different
periods in musical history.  Can the practicing of these basic &quot;building
blocks&quot; be used to enhance creativity, interpretation, overall tone and
musicianship, &amp;c., &amp;c. efficiently as, say, using a try-square in
carpentry? Of course they can, and well they should. Joe Pass, among
others, is merely stating that they are not a means unto themselves, and
that if one is going to perform, he had better know some tunes. I agree.
The same applies to all musical styles, and perhaps you should listen
more closely to a Heifetz, or Bernstein, or whoever you wish, and let
them rub off on you a little - jazz is also about letting many, many
influences, both Western and Eastern, become something from which to
draw upon in that quest for creative ideas. Listen to Nat Cole, listen
to Walter Bishop Jr., listen to John Coltrane, &amp;c.

I'm not going to fall into a senseless discussion as to why you think
jazz musicians are so different from any others. To quote Pops (or Duke,
depending upon who you feel to be the true source), &quot;There ain't but two
kinds of music, good and bad&quot;.

best,
Bobby

That's a great analogy.  Athletes have routines and excercises they

I apologize for offending you.  Clearly there is a misunderstanding
and I have no doubt that if I were taking private lessons with you, I
would have a much better idea of the context of your quote of Heifetz'
&quot;Scales, scales scales!&quot; and how it is relevant to how one should
prepare &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, &quot;Donna Lee&quot; and other tunes from within the
genre of jazz.

Of the time you spend working on a jazz tune, how much of this
practice time is on scales?  50%?  80%?  25%?

There are a few...Joe Diorio has books on Rhythm Changes and Giant
Steps.  THere's another player (Herb Ellis? not sure) who has a
series of books, each on a different tune.

Of course, the the other thing you can do is transcribe a few solos
on the tune your working on. :)

Like I said, it depends upon the student, and so, therefore, my own
practice is works best for me at any given time. Sometimes I practice
lots of scales, arps, and technical things, and sometimes almost none at
all. It depends upon what I'm trying to get out of a particular practice
session. But because I know a b'zillion tunes, I have that luxury at
this time in my life, and my goal is to give that luxury to my students
as quickly as possible, while still hitting them wit the basics so
necessary at that time in their development. Kind of a gray line, I
guess, with the best of both worlds being best achieved by those
students willing to commit to 4-6 hours daily (for obvious reasons).

Anyway, you didn't offend me, but I really appreciate the &quot;preemptive

Thanks, Bob!

My understanding from the jazz masters who also have a classical
background is that classical repertoire can help with:

1. Improvisation - if you believe that improvisation is instant
composition.  If so, then every improviser, as an instant composer,
can benefit from studying compositional techniques - why not borrow
from the great composers?  Or so the theory goes... This is too
advanced for my current level of jazz study, but I intend to get to it
eventually.  I'm still at the level at which one bases the improv on
the tune's melody line, in a basic way as opposed to, say coming up
with a retrograde inversion of the line.

2. Technique - can't argue with the results (Heifetz, Starker, etc.
from the classical side; Hancock, Corea, etc. from jazz).

My cello teacher is more advanced than me on the art of physically
operating the cello, but we started jazz studies around the same time.
She is of the belief that one should practice lots of scale/mode
fingerings for hours and prepare a repertoire of licks to use for
performance.  This may work for her because she does music for a
living and thus has more hours/day for practice than I do.  I on the
other hand have a day job and can average about 3 hours a week of
practice.  So I work on scales/modes a little (relatively speaking)
and tunes a lot.  If I'm having trouble playing a line that I just
invented in my head and I find it fits a certain scale/mode, then I'll
work on that scale/mode - up-down, 1234-2345-etc pattern, skipping
around intervallically, etc.

I just study jazz for fun, not to perform or take a pro's job away, fwiw.
