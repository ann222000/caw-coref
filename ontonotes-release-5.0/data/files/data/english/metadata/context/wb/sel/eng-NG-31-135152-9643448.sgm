I'm so excited, I just found out I'm getting a &quot;Power Mac 8100/100AV
with applevision monitor and a keyboard.&quot;  Haven't seen it yet, what
does everybody think?  What's a good Yahoo group supporting this model?
Will I be happy with this?  I've got lots of young kids, and we
homeschool, so I'll be loading this up with old educational software and
kids games.

Oh, yeah, the person who's giving it to me said it runs Windows 95, and
that it's too slow for the internet.  That's all I know!

OK, so I picked up this &quot;Windows 95&quot; Power Mac 8100/100AV, it's got a 17
inch monitor, not bad, and other than a missing cover plate for the bay
beneath the floppy, and a minor burn on the top of the keyboard, all
looks very good.

Will this serve as the &quot;bridge&quot; I've been looking for to get software
onto my SE?  My SE has an 800k floppy (I also just received another
dual-floppy SE, again for free) and I have lots of software for it
sitting on my PC in .sit and .hqx files, but no way to load them onto
the 20MB (WOW) hard drive.  Since the 8100/100AV has a &quot;1.4 MB
SuperDrive&quot; I assume that I'll be able to transfer files to floppies
(once I find some dd floppies) correct?

I also need to figure out what sort of cable I need to hook up an
external SCSI hard drive to the SE.  Is it a common cable, or will I be
tearing my hair out looking for one?

Still hoping for ideas about good forums on Yahoo for these old Power Macs.

Well, I don't know about a bridge, but the 8100 can format and write
data to 800k floppies. If there is an operating system on the 8100
you probably have a version of Stuffit expander in order to open
the .sit files.

The external SCSI port on the back of the SE is the 25 pin used on
most Macs. Looks just like a PC parallel port. The cable needed
depends on the ports on the exernal SCSI drive. Once you know what
ports are on the external, drop me a note  OFF LIST, and I can
probably help you out. If you go to a store such as Frys, you will
probably pay $15-25 for the cable you need.

It could have either the Connectix PC emulator
software, which would be REALLY SLOW on a 100Mhz PPC
601 or it might have one of Orange Micro's 80486 CPU
NuBus PC cards installed.

If it has one of the Orange Micro cards, do not format
the hard drive until you find and save the software
for the card. Orange Micro is out of business and
finding drivers for their PC cards for Macintosh is
not easy.

Where it's the AV model, that means it has the AV
videocard in the PDS slot. You can plug S-video cables
directly into it, or composite video cables with
adapters. I have a Radius clone of the 8100/110 with
the AV card. I've tried without success to find the
full pinout of the two video ports on that card.

The not so great thing about the AV card is it's based
on the AV card technology used in the Quadra AV series
so it's not as fast as it could be. Apple made another
PDS videocard for the x100 series called HPV or High
Performance Video. It doesn't do video I/O but it's
faster than the AV card and can be expanded with more
video RAM.

Another thing with the x100 series is they're a bit of
a &quot;Road Apple&quot;. They don't play well with NuBus SCSI
cards due to a problem with the built in SCSI
controller. That was somewhat fixed in the 110Mhz 7100
and 8100. (But not good enough to allow a NuBus SCSI
card to be used with the Media 100 video editing
hardware.)

There are G3 upgrades available for these, but they
plug into the PDS, displacing your AV or HPV card.
Some have a kit available to mount the PDS video card
upside down in the center NuBus slot. Doesn't help
much if you have all three slots in use. (Such as with
the two boards of the Media 100 kit and an Asante
10/100 network card.)

Greg, in my experience the 10/100 cards barely outperform the 10baset
built in ethernet in the nubus Mac's.

The SCSI cable you need is just a standard cable. Your 8100 will have
a db25 female port so you'll need a db25 male to most likely a
centronics style male connector on the other end. Unless your external
SCSI drive also has a DB25 female port (a few do) in which case you'll
need a db25 male &gt; db25 male cable. If you need either one of these I
can offer it to you for free as long as you pay postage. Gotta keep
these old Mac's running. :)

The pinouts of the I and O video ports are identical.  The pinout is

the same document.   If you like I will email you a copy.   Just

An interesting experiment which I have never tried, would be to
install a G3 card with PDS pass-through in the PDS slot of a Power
120 from Power Computing.   You would have to put the machine in a
different case because the PDS slot is on the left (bottom) of the
motherboard and it would intrude on the case.

Anyway, with the PDS slot differently positioned in the PCC machine,
one could install a G3 upgrade and HPV video card and not intrude on
the space for the three NuBus slots.

Jeff Walther

P.S.  An even more interesting experiment would be to activate the
two unpopulated NuBus slots on the Power 120 for a 5 NuBus slot, G3,
HPV NuBus PowerMac, but that would require designing a new I/O card
(not the AV card, PCCs special card which bears most of the IO ports)
with a Fat AMIC chip on it instead of the regular AMIC.

it was the Umax s900?
