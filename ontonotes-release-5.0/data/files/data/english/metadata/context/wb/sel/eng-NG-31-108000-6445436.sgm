HI.

As a gift I got a knockoff of the Beadazzler.  The gift giver said she
thought I could use it on my cards.

Anyone have one and what do you think?  Granted I'll have to mist the
stuff but I do have those funky brads that might work in it.

thoughts?
Kate

I have the real Beadazzler.  I tried it on a scrap piece of cardstock
and it just tore the paper.  If you can get it to work, I'll be jealous.

I think it would be great.  Just another way to set an embellishment.

OK now that is disappointing news, but important to know.  So, Kate you'll
have to experiment and let us know.
