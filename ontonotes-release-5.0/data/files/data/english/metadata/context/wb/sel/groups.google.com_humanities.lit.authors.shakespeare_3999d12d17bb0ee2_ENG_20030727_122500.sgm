I'm hoping a knowledgable Oxfordian can help here.

The dedication in Shakespeare's First Folio of 1623 reads:

21: TO THE MOST NOBLE
22: AND
23: INCOMPARABLE PAIRE
24: OF BRETHREN.
25: WILLIAM
26: Earle of Pembroke, &amp;c. Lord Chamberlaine to the
27: Kings most Excellent Maiesty.
28: AND
29: PHILIP
30: Earle of Montgomery, &amp;c. Gentleman of his Maiesties
31: Bed-Chamber. Both Knights of the most Noble Order
32: of the Garter, and our singular good
33: LORDS.
34: Right Honourable,
35: Whilst we studie to be thankful in our particular, for
36: the many fauors we haue receiued from your L.L
37: we are falne vpon the ill fortune, to mingle
38: two the most diuerse things that that can bee, feare,
39: and rashnesse; rashnesse in the enterprize, and
40: feare of the successe. For, when we valew the places your H.H.
41: sustaine, we cannot but know their dignity greater, then to descend to
42: the reading of these trifles: and, while we name them trifles, we haue
43: depriu'd our selues of the defence of our Dedication. But since your
44: L.L. haue beene pleas'd to thinke these trifles some-thing, heereto-fore;
45: and haue prosequuted both them, and their Authour liuing,
46: with so much fauour: we hope, that (they out-liuing him, and he not
47: hauing the fate, common with some, to be exequutor to his owne wri-tings)
48: you will vse the like indulgence toward them, you haue done
49: vnto their parent. There is a great difference, whether any Booke
50: choose his Patrones, or finde them: This hath done both. For,
51: so much were your L.L. likings of the seuerall parts, when
52: they were acted, as before they were published, the Volume ask'd to
53: be yours. We haue but collected them, and done an office to the
54: dead, to procure his Orphanes, Guardians; without ambition ei-ther
55: of selfe-profit, or fame: onely to keepe the memory of so worthy
56: a Friend, &amp; Fellow aliue, as was our SHAKESPEARE, by hum-ble
57: offer of his playes, to your most noble patronage. Wherein, as
58: we haue iustly obserued, no man to come neere your L.L. but with
59: a kind of religious addresse; it hath bin the height of our care, who
60: are the Presenters, to make the present worthy of your H.H. by the
61: perfection. But, there we must also craue our abilities to be considerd,
62: my Lords. We cannot go beyond our owne powers. Country hands
63: reach foorth milke, creame, fruites, or what they haue: and many
64: Nations (we haue heard) that had not gummes &amp; incense, obtai-ned
65: their requests with a leauened Cake. It was no fault to approch
66: their Gods, by what meanes they could: And the most, though
67: meanest, of things are made more precious, when they are dedicated
68: to Temples. In that name therefore, we most humbly consecrate to
69: your H.H. these remaines of your seruant Shakespeare; that
70: what delight is in them, may be euer your L.L. the reputation
71: his, &amp; the faults ours, if any be committed, by a payre so carefull to
72: shew their gratitude both to the liuing, and the dead, as is
73: Your Lordshippes most bounden,
74: IOHN HEMINGE.
75: HENRY CONDELL.

Now, we've heard from Oxfordians great and small that one
important reason the Folio was dedicated to William and Philip
Herbert was that Philip married Susan Vere (and had ten children)
and that William was engaged to Bridget Vere (but never married).
In fact Philip married Susan on December 27, 1604, after Oxford's
death. So that is somehow supposed to link Oxford to the canon, as
though the King's Men dedicating it knew it was the work of Oxford
and therefore were dedicating it to his son in law and would-be son in law.

[Feel free to correct that reasoning if I have it wrong.]

Here is a little on Philip and William Herbert from (Oxfodian) Volker's site:
+++
Philip Herbert, Earl of Mongomery
(10/10/1584 - 1/23/1650)
Patron of the arts one of the dedicatees of the
First Folio. Married Oxford's daughter, Susan.

William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke
(4/8/1580 - 4/10/1630)
One of the dedicatees of the First Folio. Some
consider him Mr. WH and/or the Fair Youth of the Sonnets.
Imprisoned in 1601 for making a bastard with Mary Fitton.
+++

WELL, when the Fletcher and Beaumont First Folio was
published in 1647, a few things had changed...

William Herbert had died in 1630.
Philip Earl of Montgomery had gained the
title Earl of Pembroke.
Susan Vere Herbert had died in 1627.

BUT, one thing didn't change...
The ten fellowes who were dedicating
the Fletcher/Beaumont Folio still dedicated
it to Philip Herbert. Here is their text:

T O
THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE
P H I L I P
Earle of Pembroke and Mountgomery:
Baron Herbert of Cardiffe and Sherland,
Lord Parr and Ross of Kendall; Lord Fitz-Hugh,
Marmyon, and Saint Quintin; Knight of the most noble Order of
the Garter; and one of His Majesties most Honourable Privie Councell:
And our Singular Good Lord.

MY LORD,

THere is none among all the Names of Honour, that hath more
encouraged the Legitimate Muses of this latter Age, then that
which is owing to your Familie; whose Coronet shines bright
with the native luster of its owne Jewels, which with the accesse
of some Beames of Sydney, twisted with their Flame presents a Constellation,
from whose Influence all good may be still expected upon Witt and Learning.
At this Truth we rejoyce, but yet aloofe, and in our owne valley, for we dare
not approach with any capacity in our selves to apply your Smile, since wee have
only preserved as Trustees to the Ashes of the Authors, what wee exhibit to
your Honour, it being no more our owne, then those Imperiall Crownes and
Garlands were the Souldiers, who were honourably designed for their Convey-
ance before the Triumpher to the Capitol.
But directed by the example of some, who once steered in our qualitie, and so
fortunately aspired to choose your Honour, joyned with your (now glorified)
Brother, Patrons to the flowing compositions of the then expired sweet Swan of
Avon SHAKESPEARE; and since, more particularly bound to your Lordships
most constant and diffusive Goodnesse, from which, wee did for many calme
yeares derive a subsistence to our selves, and Protection to the Scene (now withe-
red, and condemn'd, as we feare, to a long Winter and sterilitie) we have presumed
to offer to your Selfe, what before was never printed of these Authours.
Had they beene lesse then all the Treasure we had contracted in the whole Age
of Poesie (some few Poems of their owne excepted, which already published, com-
mand their entertainement, with all lovers of Art and Language) or were they
not, the most justly admir'd, and belov'd Pieces of Witt and the World, wee
should have taught our selves a lesse Ambition.
Be pleased to accept this humble tender of our duties, and till wee faile in our
obedience to all your Commands, vouchsafe, we may be knowne by the Cogni-
zance and Character of
MY LORD,

Your Honours most bounden

Richard Robinson Robert Benfeild

NOTE THAT THESE ten men here reiterate that Philip
had patronized Shakespeare and again make it known
publicly that Shakespeare was the Sweet Swan of Avon.

SO, it appears far more likely that the dedication of
Shakespeare's First Folio to the Herberts had nothing to
do with Oxford or his daughters, and that the Herberts
were THE soft touch, the most likely source of cash (in
hopes they would purchase a few hundred copies?) and
that Philip remained so for another 20+ years.

Hey, knowledgable Oxfordians, do I have this right?

EL(i)ZA's wedding
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;In celebration of the 1613 marriage of James' daughter ELiZAbeth to
the Elector Palatine, the plays: The Tempest, Julius Caesar, Much Ado,
Othello, The Winter's Tale and both parts of Henry IV were played. The
festivities were marred by the sudden death of Henry, Prince of Wales.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;After a sleepless night, ELZA confronted her husband
with the oath-breaking question: &quot;In the name of our sons -
what do you call yourself? And from where do you come?&quot;

&quot;Know this: in a far-off land, inaccessible to you all, there stands a
castle, called Montsalwatsch. In the center gleams a glittering house of
God, more splendid than any ever built on earth. And this house contains
the most precious thing in existence: the Holy Grail. Twelve brave
heroes were selected to protect it. They are also available to come to
the assistance of innocent people who ask for help. King Percival
is the leader and all who serve him recieve strength from the Grail.
But no one is allowed to ask their names or who sent them.
They have to leave anyone who discovers their identity.&quot;

ELZA cried out at this declaration but the SWAN knight's
voice continued as though it were coming from another world:

&quot;I was sent here from the Grail. My father is King Percival.
I, his knight-errant, am named Lohengrin!&quot;&gt;&gt;

[Rhine Sagas, as told in Germany *throughout history*]

Lohengrin, The SWAN Knight of Kleve
-----------------------------------------------------------------
SWEET SWAN of AVON! what a sight it were
To see thee in our waters yet appeare,
And make those flights upon the bankes of Thames,
That so did take EL(i)ZA, and our James !

Two new (NOVA) star explosions pertain to Oxford's life/death

Tycho's NOVA: In November, 1572 in Cassiopeia
(Five months after Eliza had executed Oxford's
beloved cousin, the Duke of Norfolk).
Cassiopeia/the Queen was transformed into a crooked cross.
(Tycho coined the term NOVA.)

Kepler's NOVA: In October, 1604 in Ophiuchus/SERPENS.
Four months after Oxford himself died.

&lt;&lt;Ophiuchus (off-ih-YOU-cus) struggling with the monster serpent
constellation SERPENS symbolizes the struggle of light against
darkness, order versus chaos, and good versus evil.

The struggle of light against darkness is particularly reminiscent
of the Gospel according to John that was central to so many
Christian secret societies (in addition to ISIS). Ophiuchus
is also identified with the first (male) doctor: Aesculapius.
(The first female doctor was ISIS.)&gt;&gt;

[Tycho &amp; Kepler recorded these NOVA from the island
of HVEN just a few miles SSE of Elsinore castle.]
--------------------------------------------------------------
KING CLAUDIUS Where is Polonius?

HAMLET In heaven [HVEN?]; send hither to see:
if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the
other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not
within this month, you shall nose [Tycho's gold nose?]
him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.

In this table, Melancholy (i.e., manic-depression) is equated
with creativity, reasoning &amp; intuition as categorized
by Mars, Jupiter &amp; Saturn.

Four months after Oxford's (summer soltice) death on June 24, 1604
there was a much anticipated &quot;grouping or clustering&quot; of these very
planets (Mars, Jupiter &amp; Saturn) in the southwest evening sky.
A comet was even &quot;predicted by the astrology of the Arabs&quot;.
However, what actually transpired was far more interesting:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Errors in &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; Planetarium Shows
by John Mosley, Griffith Observatory

&lt;&lt;The massing of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in 1604 was awaited with
anticipation. &quot;Somee watched to correct their ephemerides, some for the
sake of pleasure, some because of the rarity of the occasion, some to
verify their predictions, and others, indeed, to see if there would be
a comet as had been expressly predicted by the astrology of the Arabs,&quot;

Kepler wrote (Kepler) Opera Omnia vol. II, p.617, as quoted by
BurkeGaffney). Mars came first into conjunction with Saturn,
on September 26, and then with Jupiter on October 9.
Although Kepler missed this last event because of clouds,
others in Europe saw the two planets and noted nothing amiss.

On October 10 a new star, as bright as Jupiter, was spotted essentially
between Jupiter &amp; Saturn, which themselves were only 9 degrees apart.
Kepler observed it carefully until it faded into the sun's glare
the following year, and later wrote a book De Stella Nova in
Pede Serpentarti (About the New Star in the Serpent's Foot).

While writing this book, Kepler came across a work by Laurence
SUSlyga of Poland that argued that Christ was born in 4 B.C.
Kepler noticed that this was shortly after a triple conjunction that
he calculated had occurred in 7 B.C., and wondered if there was a
connection. In 1614 he published his conclusions: the triple conjunction
of 7 B.C. was followed by a massing of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in 6
B.C., and just as the conjunction and massing of 1603 4 had produced a
new star, so the events of 7 6 B.C. had produced a miraculous nova, and
THAT NOVA was the Star of Bethlehem. The biblical triple conjunction
took place in Pisces, but the massing that followed took place
in Aries -- one of the fiery signs -- just as the massing of 1604
had also taken place in a fiery sign.

Kepler believed that the star over Bethlehem was a nova placed
there specifically to alert and guide the magi. He wrote,
&quot;I do not doubt but that God would have condescended
to cater to the credulity of the Chaldeans.&gt;&gt;

of Cologne, and, in his Dioptrice (1611), Kepler discussed its theory:

positive eyepiece. The latter offered a field of view larger than that
(~ ¼ degree) of a Galilean system of the same (20x) power.

The preface (pages 1-28) is devoted to Galileo's Sidereus nuncius,
the newly invented telescope and the celestial objects revealed by it,
and how these observations support the Copernican theory.

--------------------------------------------------------
_STWED MUTTON_ by HL Brighid Ros

&lt;&lt;When originally reading the recipe, I had an impression of a lamb
stew. It quickly became apparent that I had misinterpreted this, the
recipe is indeed for lamb, or mutton, stewed in juice flavored by spices.
I chose to make both versions mentioned in Two Fifteenth Century
Cookbooks. It would be interesting to compare the tastes
between the wine version, and the ale version.

A distinction is made between using Ale and Beer. In The Art of
Cookery In the Middle Ages Terence Scully quotes Andrew Boorde
(c.1490-1549) on the difference between ale and beer. &quot;Ale is made of
malte and water: and they the wich do put any other thynge to ale then
is rehersed, except yest, barme or godesgood, doth sofystical theyr ale.
Ale for an Englusshe man is a naturall drinke. Barly malte maketh better
ale then oten malte [malted oats] or any other corne [grain] doth. It
doth ingendre grose humoures, but yette it maketh a man stronge..
Bere is mad of malte, of hopes, and water: it is a naturall drynke of a
Dutche man. An now of late dayes it is moche used in Englande
to the dtryment of many Englysshe men.&quot;[ii]

Scully also speaks on the subject of substitutes for jerjuice, &quot;
Alternatives , if not substitutes for verjuice had to be on hand in most
kitchens. Recipes are common enough in the course of which the writer
gives advice on how to make an ersatz verjoice, '.if it is the time of
year in which you do not have any.' For instance in the Tuscan Libro
della cocina the author advises, &quot;Should there be a want of verjoice,
you can use lemon juice, orange juice, or rose water.'&quot;[iii]

The Recipe comes from Two Fifteenth-Century Cookery-Books : Harleian MS.
279 (ab 1430), &amp; Harl. MS. 4016 (ab. 1450), with extracts from Ashmole
MS. 1439, Laud MS. 553, &amp; Douce MS. 55. The recipe can be found in
Cookery Book II. Harleian MS. 4016, ab. 1450 A.D. Folio 4b Page 72.

&quot;The Ancient Cookeries edited in this volume have been copied
from Harleian MSS. 279 and 4016, in the British Museum. The first MS.
was copied, and partly prepared for the press, by the late Mr. Faulke
Watling, of the University of Oxford, but his untimely death prevented
his seeing it through the Press. This MS. is divided into three Parts,
the first, headed Kalendare de Potages dyuers, containing 153 recipes:
the second Part, Kalendare de Leche Metys, has 64 recipes, and the third
Part, Dyuerse bake metis, 41 recipes. This MS., besides the Cookery,
contains the Bills of Fare of several Banquets which are noticed more
fully below. The date of this MS. is about 1430 or 1440, and has been
given a little too early on pages 1 and 5. This has been collated with
Ashmole MS. 1439, in the Bodleian, noted as A. in the text.&quot; [iv]

And again &quot;The MS. that we possess was presented to Queen Elizabeth
by Lord Stafford, and afterwards belonged to the Earl of Oxford,
being purchased at his sale; it is now in the British Museum.&quot;&gt;&gt;

TIMAEUS by Plato

&lt;&lt;Tell us, said the other, the whole story, and how
and from whom Solon heard this veritable tradition.

He replied: In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river NILE
divides, there is a certain district called the district of SAIS,
and the great city of the district is also called SAIS, and is the city
from which King Amasis came. . . And they did in fact at that time
create a VERy great and mighty movement; uniting with the EVER-FLOWING
stream in stirring up and violently SHAKING the courses of the soul,&gt;&gt;

in the first place ease of motion, then that the stream of the good soul
is unimpeded,and has therefore the attribute of EVER FLOWING
without let or hindrance, and is therefore called ARETE,

and is therefore called ARETE, or, more correctly, aeireite

(eligible), indicating that nothing is more eligible than virtue, and
this has been hammered into ARETE.&gt;&gt; - Plato (CRATYLUS)

PROVERBS 18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters,
and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.
18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked,

18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention,
and his mouth calleth for strokes.
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction,
and his lips are the snare of his soul.

&lt;&lt;The DE VERES were an ancient dynastic family seated at their ancestral
village of VER (from which they took their name), near Bayeaux and the
River VIRE, in MANCHE on the Normandy coast of present-day northern
France. The name of the town itself came from the &quot;VER,&quot; a Norse word
meaning *FISHDAM* that the Vikings had introduced into Normandy.&gt;&gt;
