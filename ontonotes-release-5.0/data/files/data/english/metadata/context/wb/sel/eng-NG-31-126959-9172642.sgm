I can't seem to get the search to work the way I wanted to tonight.
For example, I type in &quot;widget -red&quot; should return everything with
widget in title and not contain red.  But eBay seems to be dropping
the &quot;-&quot; sign from search and the search ends up &quot;widget red&quot;.  Also
some of the returned result does not have &quot;widget&quot; in the title and I
don't have search description checked so where did that come from?

Half of my favorite searches are turning inaccurate results as well.
One of them which picks out certain video game in Video Game category
has been returning penis pump in the search even though the penis pump
doesn't have the keyword in title and isn't listed in video game
category.

Search was working fine for me this morning.

Check to see if they've stuck you in the new search, which seriously
sucks.  If so, there will be a line at the top of the search results
that gives you the option to go back to the regular search.

The new search drove me nuts because I couldn't search for NTS16, it
changed it - arbitrarily - to NSS16, for no apparent reason.  About the
time I was ready to throw the whole thing out the window, I saw the note
about it being the &quot;new search.&quot;

Thank you!!!

eBay blows for forcing untested beta of crapware on us without big and
clear print.

Since a few days searching title only means eBay will also search the text in
the item specifics. Annoying, but unfortunatelly this cannot be altered...
