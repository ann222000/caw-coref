Finally, in the domain of wisdom the Ariyan Dhamma and the non-dual systems once
again move in contrary directions. In the non-dual systems the task of wisdom is
to break through the diversified appearances (or the appearance of diversity) in
order to discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete phenomena,
in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while true
reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman, the
Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind, etc.).
For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental unity in
which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they really are
(yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must respect
phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and plurality
untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena, to gain
insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the direction of
an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement and
detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
"undermines" concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does it
treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are: "And what
does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such its
arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
consciousness, such its arising and passing away." "When one sees, 'All
formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,' one
turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity."

I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
an "underlying unity."  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
emphasis on a "one is all" type thinking, even in teachings on non-
duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim "one is NOT all."
To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
"underlying unity" is to create another kind of polarity.  The
teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
"release from the all" or any concept of "all."

Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for "non-
duality" simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,
a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

The actual true nature of reality as it actually is forms a literal singularity.
Although there may be many different ways of saying it, there can only possibly
be ONE truth. It is not at all that the Hindu point of view diverges to the
slightest degree from the Zen point of view, it is merely ignorance that makes
it seem as if they diverge.

As soon as one is utterly released from oneself and completely detached from
everything "else", then ONE and ALL are directly experienced as
one-and-the-same.

In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation.
Perhaps seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping
of the subject object split.  This is very common even in
ordinary perception under concentration, like reading,
doing sports, even viewing TV.  The subject object split
usually only comes up when 'self' feels threatened or when
natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when one
attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the pain',
or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration (as perfected
by meditation) to disperse the subject-object dichotomy and
the necessary difficulties that always must follow a self against
the world.

There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to support
no-self.  But primarily no-self is an experience, not an idea.
No-separation seems to be a factor of awakening.

This isn't about passivity.  There is action but no actor.
The sensation of acting is only in the 'understanding'
of a self in the world.  A mind-made problem.

Unity or multiplicity is just one idea or the other.
No idea can transcend the rational dichotomies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unity in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plurality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena, to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the direction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are: &quot;And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,' one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt;&gt;&gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt;&gt;&gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt;&gt;&gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt;&gt;&gt; theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt;&gt;&gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt;&gt;&gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,

&gt; usually only comes up when 'self' feels threatened or when
&gt; natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when one
&gt; attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the pain',
&gt; or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration (as perfected
&gt; by meditation) to disperse the subject-object dichotomy and

however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but
what there is to awaken to.  in other words, it implicates a possible
metaphysics.  what is the metaphysics of Buddhism beyond ending
suffering?  what is awakened to once ignorance has been defeated?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unity in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plurality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to gain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;And what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not in a position
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to make any kind of sweeping statements.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All I like to say is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Buddha would have disapproved of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the hasty generalizations in both posts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in this statement itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Case by case, always.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you feel more free and empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after writing the above post?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the subject object split.  This is very common even in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ordinary perception under concentration, like reading,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing sports, even viewing TV.  The subject object split
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually only comes up when 'self' feels threatened or when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the pain',
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration (as perfected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by meditation) to disperse the subject-object dichotomy and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the necessary difficulties that always must follow a self against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no-self.  But primarily no-self is an experience, not an idea.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No-separation seems to be a factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't about passivity.  There is action but no actor.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The sensation of acting is only in the 'understanding'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a self in the world.  A mind-made problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unity or multiplicity is just one idea or the other.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No idea can transcend the rational dichotomies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wonderful speculation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Too bad writing about it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is not a good example of such action.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, stopping might be.

I got the message.
I understand the idea.
But I don't think
I had the experience.

How about you?
If you had the experience,
you need to find a better way

This may be true, but my problem is that referring to such a
singulary, speaking of it, or proporting that the goal of awaking is
to "see" the it, creates an abstraction that would more likely get in
the way.  Now instead of being free you are looking for something that
somebody told you about.  You have no idea what it looks like, so you
invent something.  You have no idea what the experience might be like,
so you take a guess, and you orient yourself towards that.  I would
imagine this would prevent one from ever being free.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although there may be many different ways of saying it, there can only possibly
&gt; be ONE truth. It is not at all that the Hindu point of view diverges to the
&gt; slightest degree from the Zen point of view, it is merely ignorance that makes
&gt; it seem as if they diverge.
">

Right.  It's the same thing, but a different presentation.  The
teachings are what's different.  My problem with the above is that it
presents the mahayana teachings as being essentially what Hinduism
teaches.  It may be the same truth, but the teachings are entirely
different.

&gt; one-and-the-same.

I think one's concern should be the *process* of release and
liberation rather than from any concept of "one" or "all."

&gt; In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation.
&gt; Perhaps seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping
&gt; of the subject object split.  This is very common even in
&gt; ordinary perception under concentration, like reading,
&gt; doing sports, even viewing TV.  The subject object split
&gt; usually only comes up when 'self' feels threatened or when
&gt; natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when one
&gt; attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the pain',
&gt; or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration (as perfected
&gt; by meditation) to disperse the subject-object dichotomy and
&gt; the necessary difficulties that always must follow a self against
&gt; the world.

What you have to be careful of is turning a practice into a
philosophy.  "Become the pain" is a skillful means, but if it leads
you to actually conclude intellectually that you and pain are the
same, then you've introduced a new deluded notion rather than get rid
of an old one.

&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to support

Not-self is a teaching that talks about the way one creates suffering
through self identification.  It is not a statement about the
existence of a self.

The Buddha never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, said that there
was no self.  He never said there was a self.  He taught that one of
the ways we create suffering is through the idea "I am my body, I am
my feeling...perception..fabrication...conciousness."

To say "there is no self, there is only unity" is to turn a practice
into a philosophy.  There are a helluvalotta Buddhists out there
making this mistake

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, in the domain of wisdom the Ariyan Dhamma and the non-dual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; systems once
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again move in contrary directions. In the non-dual systems the task of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wisdom is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to break through the diversified appearances (or the appearance of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity) in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order to discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mind, etc.).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unity in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plurality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena, to gain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;And what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formations...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not in a position
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to make any kind of sweeping statements.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All I like to say is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Buddha would have disapproved of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the hasty generalizations in both posts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in this statement itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Case by case, always.

I think that the best way to get there would be something like unifying the two
paragraphs that are the subject of this thread. Try to experience actual reality
entirely apart from any and all preconceived notions pertaining to the nature of
reality.  When you get this part right, then the inherent singularity of
existence shines through on its own.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not in a position
&gt; &gt;&gt; to make any kind of sweeping statements.
&gt; &gt;&gt; All I like to say is that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the Buddha would have disapproved of
&gt; &gt;&gt; all the hasty generalizations in both posts
&gt; &gt;&gt; and in this statement itself.

&gt; &gt; I think you should practice being silent more.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Case by case, always.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you feel more free and empty
&gt; &gt;&gt; after writing the above post?

&gt; &gt; It clarified some things for me personally.

&gt; I think you should practice being silent more.

Yes, indeed.  Congratulations on hitting the over 18,000 posts BTW.

&gt;&gt;The actual true nature of reality as it actually is forms a literal singularity.

&gt; This may be true, but my problem is that referring to such a
&gt; singulary, speaking of it, or proporting that the goal of awaking is
&gt; to &quot;see&quot; the it, creates an abstraction that would more likely get in
&gt; the way.  Now instead of being free you are looking for something that
&gt; somebody told you about.  You have no idea what it looks like, so you
&gt; invent something.  You have no idea what the experience might be like,
&gt; so you take a guess, and you orient yourself towards that.  I would
&gt; imagine this would prevent one from ever being free.

&gt;&gt;Although there may be many different ways of saying it, there can only possibly
&gt;&gt;be ONE truth. It is not at all that the Hindu point of view diverges to the
&gt;&gt;slightest degree from the Zen point of view, it is merely ignorance that makes
&gt;&gt;it seem as if they diverge.

&gt; Right.  It's the same thing, but a different presentation.  The
&gt; teachings are what's different.  My problem with the above is that it
&gt; presents the mahayana teachings as being essentially what Hinduism
&gt; teaches.  It may be the same truth, but the teachings are entirely
&gt; different.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;As soon as one is utterly released from oneself and completely detached from
&gt;&gt;everything &quot;else&quot;, then ONE and ALL are directly experienced as
&gt;&gt;one-and-the-same.

&gt; I think one's concern should be the *process* of release and
&gt; liberation rather than from any concept of &quot;one&quot; or &quot;all.&quot;

&gt; -DaveK

process of release is good; like a real muscle or way of living that one
can actually practice, rather than aspire towards.  something that is
actual in the moment.

The method makes no difference at all, it is only the awakening itself that
counts. By whatever teaching and method one realizes awaking one has used the
right method and teaching. Some methods and teachings are more effective and

The thing that helped me the most is the phrase {non duality of subject and

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;And what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; its
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt; In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping
&gt;&gt; of the subject object split.  This is very common even in
&gt;&gt; ordinary perception under concentration, like reading,
&gt;&gt; doing sports, even viewing TV.  The subject object split
&gt;&gt; usually only comes up when 'self' feels threatened or when
&gt;&gt; natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when one
&gt;&gt; attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt;&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the pain',
&gt;&gt; or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration (as perfected
&gt;&gt; by meditation) to disperse the subject-object dichotomy and
&gt;&gt; the necessary difficulties that always must follow a self against
&gt;&gt; the world.

&gt; What you have to be careful of is turning a practice into a
&gt; philosophy.  &quot;Become the pain&quot; is a skillful means, but if it leads
&gt; you to actually conclude intellectually that you and pain are the
&gt; same, then you've introduced a new deluded notion rather than get rid
&gt; of an old one.

&gt;&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to support
&gt;&gt; no-self.  But primarily no-self is an experience, not an idea.
&gt;&gt; No-separation seems to be a factor of awakening.

&gt; Not-self is a teaching that talks about the way one creates suffering
&gt; through self identification.  It is not a statement about the
&gt; existence of a self.

&gt; The Buddha never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,
&gt; ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, said that there
&gt; was no self.  He never said there was a self.  He taught that one of
&gt; the ways we create suffering is through the idea &quot;I am my body, I am
&gt; my feeling...perception..fabrication...conciousness.&quot;

&gt; To say &quot;there is no self, there is only unity&quot; is to turn a practice
&gt; into a philosophy.  There are a helluvalotta Buddhists out there
&gt; making this mistake

Awakening is the direct experience of the {non duality of subject and object}.
It is nothing more than this, and it is nothing less than this. Another way of
saying exactly this same thing is {a direct seeing into self-nature}.

Wonderful!

Does that experience just go away
or you can keep it forever?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appearances (or the appearance of diversity) in order
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to discover the unifying reality that underlies them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Concrete phenomena, in their distinctions and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plurality, are mere appearance, while true reality is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brahman, the Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind, etc.). For such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental unity in which opposites merge and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing things as they really are (yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know things as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are, wisdom must respect phenomena in their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and plurality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; characteristics of phenomena, to gain insight into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  direction of an all-embracing identification with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the All, but toward disengagement and detachment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way &quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to appearances, nor does it treat them as windows
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it investigates and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discerns, in order to understand

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goal as seeking an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zen, I have not heard any such emphasis on a &quot;one is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non- duality.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact it sounds like a comparative religion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; undergrad's interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is NOT all.&quot; To speak of some such abstraction, as some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such thing as an &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between mahayana and theravada is nothing more to me
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a matter of emphasis.  There is plenty of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not in a position to make any kind of sweeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statements. All I like to say is that the Buddha would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have disapproved of all the hasty generalizations in both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posts and in this statement itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Case by case, always. Do you feel more free and empty after writing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above post?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation. Perhaps seeing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without the sense of a seer, a dropping of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject object split.  This is very common even in ordinary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perception under concentration, like reading, doing sports, even viewing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV.  The subject object split usually only comes up when 'self' feels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; threatened or when natural concentration (or fascination) fails, or when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one attempts to make 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pain', or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by concentration
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (as perfected by meditation) to disperse the subject-object
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dichotomy and the necessary difficulties that always must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; follow a self against the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support no-self.  But primarily no-self is an experience,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not an idea. No-separation seems to be a factor of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't about passivity.  There is action but no actor. The sensation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of acting is only in the 'understanding' of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; self in the world.  A mind-made problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unity or multiplicity is just one idea or the other. No
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea can transcend the rational dichotomies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wonderful speculation. Too bad writing about it is not a good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example of such action.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, stopping might be.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Stumper: If this is not what you got, you haven't got IT) In zen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts there is some talk of no-separation. Perhaps seeing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without the sense of a seer, a dropping of the subject object
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; split.  This is very common even in no-self.  But primarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no-self is an experience, not an idea. No-separation seems to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I got the message. I understand the idea. But I don't think I had
&gt;&gt;&gt; the experience.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How about you?
&gt;&gt; Yes definitely!

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you had the experience, you need to find a better way to show
&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; I think that the best way to get there would be something like
&gt;&gt; unifying the two paragraphs that are the subject of this thread. Try
&gt;&gt; to experience actual reality entirely apart from any and all
&gt;&gt; preconceived notions pertaining to the nature of reality.  When you
&gt;&gt; get this part right, then the inherent singularity of existence
&gt;&gt; shines through on its own.

&gt; Good for you.

&gt; How can you tell whether
&gt; what you are experiencing is real or not?
">

Since everything is inherently real, I will assume that you are really asking
this next question:
How does one know if one's awakening is genuine?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; least in Zen, I have not heard any such emphasis on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; non- duality. In fact it sounds like a comparative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religion undergrad's interpretation of Mahayana.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;one is NOT all.&quot; To speak of some such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abstraction, as some such thing as an &quot;underlying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teachings of nonduality are still about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disengatement and detachment, &quot;release from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between mahayana and theravada is nothing more to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me than a matter of emphasis.  There is plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discussions of higher Jhanas and in discussions of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awakening, but a term for &quot;non- duality&quot; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice, a cure for ending suffering by ending the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ignorance that prevents awakening.  Mahayana is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not in a position to make any kind of sweeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statements. All I like to say is that the Buddha
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have disapproved of all the hasty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generalizations in both posts and in this statement
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Case by case, always. Do you feel more free and empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after writing the above post?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the subject object split.  This is very common even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in ordinary perception under concentration, like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reading, doing sports, even viewing TV.  The subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; object split usually only comes up when 'self' feels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; threatened or when natural concentration (or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fascination) fails, or when one attempts to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'sense' of things by thinking about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This may be about the advice of zen masters to 'become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the pain', or the heat or the cold.  Enter in by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concentration (as perfected by meditation) to disperse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject-object dichotomy and the necessary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficulties that always must follow a self against the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support no-self.  But primarily no-self is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience, not an idea. No-separation seems to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't about passivity.  There is action but no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor. The sensation of acting is only in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'understanding' of a self in the world.  A mind-made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unity or multiplicity is just one idea or the other. No
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  idea can transcend the rational dichotomies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wonderful speculation. Too bad writing about it is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good example of such action.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, stopping might be.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Stumper: If this is not what you got, you haven't got IT) In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation. Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping of the subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; object split.  This is very common even in no-self.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; primarily no-self is an experience, not an idea.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No-separation seems to be a factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got the message. I understand the idea. But I don't think I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had the experience.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How about you?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes definitely!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you had the experience, you need to find a better way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that the best way to get there would be something like
&gt;&gt;&gt; unifying the two paragraphs that are the subject of this thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Try to experience actual reality entirely apart from any and all
&gt;&gt;&gt; preconceived notions pertaining to the nature of reality.  When
&gt;&gt;&gt; you get this part right, then the inherent singularity of
&gt;&gt;&gt; existence shines through on its own.

&gt;&gt; Good for you.

&gt;&gt; How can you tell whether what you are experiencing is real or not?

&gt; Since everything is inherently real, I will assume that you are
&gt; really asking this next question: How does one know if one's
&gt; awakening is genuine?
">

No.

I'm asking whether you usually can tell
whatever you are experiencing is real or not.

&gt;&gt; Wonderful!

&gt;&gt; Does that experience just go away
&gt;&gt; or you can keep it forever?

&gt; I tune into it often and other times don't pay any attention to it, the

You mean you can experience it at will?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, in the domain of wisdom the Ariyan Dhamma and the non-dual systems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;once
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;again move in contrary directions. In the non-dual systems the task of wisdom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to break through the diversified appearances (or the appearance of diversity)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;order to discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;phenomena,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while true
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;etc.).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental unity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plurality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena, to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the direction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are: &quot;And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,' one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt;&gt;&gt;an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt;&gt;&gt;theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt;plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt;&gt;&gt;of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt;&gt;&gt;duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,

&gt;&gt;&gt;awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt;however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but

&gt; The method makes no difference at all, it is only the awakening itself that
&gt; counts. By whatever teaching and method one realizes awaking one has used the
&gt; right method and teaching. Some methods and teachings are more effective and
&gt; efficient than others.

Not my point, which had to do with *what is awakening.*  *What is there
to awaken to.*   Wrong topic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concentration (as perfected by meditation) to disperse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject-object dichotomy and the necessary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficulties that always must follow a self against the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many intellectual arguments by the Buddha to support
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no-self.  But primarily no-self is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience, not an idea. No-separation seems to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't about passivity.  There is action but no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor. The sensation of acting is only in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'understanding' of a self in the world.  A mind-made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unity or multiplicity is just one idea or the other. No
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  idea can transcend the rational dichotomies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wonderful speculation. Too bad writing about it is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good example of such action.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, stopping might be.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Stumper: If this is not what you got, you haven't got IT) In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zen accounts there is some talk of no-separation. Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing without the sense of a seer, a dropping of the subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; object split.  This is very common even in no-self.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; primarily no-self is an experience, not an idea.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No-separation seems to be a factor of awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got the message. I understand the idea. But I don't think I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had the experience.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How about you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes definitely!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you had the experience, you need to find a better way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that the best way to get there would be something like unifying the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two paragraphs that are the subject of this thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try to experience actual reality entirely apart from any and all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preconceived notions pertaining to the nature of reality.  When
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you get this part right, then the inherent singularity of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existence shines through on its own.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How can you tell whether what you are experiencing is real or not?

&gt;&gt; Since everything is inherently real, I will assume that you are
&gt;&gt; really asking this next question: How does one know if one's
&gt;&gt; awakening is genuine?

&gt; No.

&gt; I'm asking whether you usually can tell
&gt; whatever you are experiencing is real or not.

Everything is always completely real, there is nothing else besides reality.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that experience just go away
&gt;&gt;&gt; or you can keep it forever?

&gt;&gt; I tune into it often and other times don't pay any attention to it, the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Submitted for your disapproval... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but

&gt;&gt; The method makes no difference at all, it is only the awakening itself that
&gt;&gt; counts. By whatever teaching and method one realizes awaking one has used the
&gt;&gt; right method and teaching. Some methods and teachings are more effective and

I would say, Peter, that this is your terminology for that state or
experience of reality as it really is.  It is not the only way to
describe the awakened state, and it is not a way that I would prefer,
because, as I have told you in the past, that is a kind of terminology
that smacks of intellectual understanding rather than a direct
description of what is.  "no separation of subject and object" probably
describes to you what awakening is like, but it is full of concepts.
Both "subject" and "object" are concepts, so you have to envision them,
then erase them.  To me terms like "no experience of separate self" or
"a state in which you are able to just be and everything is obvious
without any doubt about what to do" or "a state of equanimity and
non-attachment" etc. etc. are more descriptive of the reality of
awakening.  "non duality of subject and object" seems much more abstract
and more removed from a real experience in the moment.

is this because you are intellectual by nature and like to express
yourself in concepts?  Or is it because your awakening is very much
centered in your head and is a product of sorting out thoughts about
reality until you discovered one that puts it all into an essential
form?  I don't know, but I do think that "non duality of subject and
object" may be a good starting point for a description of awakening
realization, but not in itself a real description of anything that can
be easily grasped.

Furthermore, it seems like your certainty that this is the *one most
correct way* to describe the awakened state and that this is the one
property that characterizes it, rather than seeing it as one way to
describe a state that cannot be encapsulated by any particular word or
concept, casts some doubt on the universality and actuality of what you
are describing.  It seems that you are more intent on the correct
concept than on the actuality of what is experienced in awakening.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Submitted for your disapproval... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-DaveK

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The method makes no difference at all, it is only the awakening itself that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;counts. By whatever teaching and method one realizes awaking one has used
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the right method and teaching. Some methods and teachings are more effective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and efficient than others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not my point, which had to do with *what is awakening.*

&gt;&gt; Awakening is the direct experience of the {non duality of subject and
&gt;&gt; object}.
&gt;&gt; It is nothing more than this, and it is nothing less than this. Another way
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; saying exactly this same thing is {a direct seeing into self-nature}.

&gt; I would say, Peter, that this is your terminology for that state or experience
&gt; of reality as it really is.  It is not the only way to describe the awakened
&gt; state, and it is not a way that I would prefer, because, as I have told you in
&gt; the past, that is a kind of terminology that smacks of intellectual
&gt; understanding rather than a direct description of what is.  &quot;no separation of
&gt; subject and object&quot; probably describes to you what awakening is like, but it
&gt; is full of concepts. Both &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; are concepts, so you have to
&gt; envision them, then erase them.  To me terms like &quot;no experience of separate
&gt; self&quot; or &quot;a state in which you are able to just be and everything is obvious
&gt; without any doubt about what to do&quot; or &quot;a state of equanimity and
&gt; non-attachment&quot; etc. etc. are more descriptive of the reality of awakening.
&gt; &quot;non duality of subject and object&quot; seems much more abstract and more removed
&gt; from a real experience in the moment.
">

I am not sure I could be wrong, but, it seems that you may have never directly
experienced full awaking. Concepts are only barriers to awakening when the
comprehension of these concepts is mistaken to be awakening itself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is this because you are intellectual by nature and like to express yourself in
&gt; concepts?  Or is it because your awakening is very much centered in your head
&gt; and is a product of sorting out thoughts about reality until you discovered
&gt; one that puts it all into an essential form?  I don't know, but I do think
&gt; that &quot;non duality of subject and object&quot; may be a good starting point for a
&gt; description of awakening realization, but not in itself a real description of
&gt; anything that can be easily grasped.

&gt; Furthermore, it seems like your certainty that this is the *one most correct
&gt; way* to describe the awakened state and that this is the one property that
&gt; characterizes it, rather than seeing it as one way to describe a state that
&gt; cannot be encapsulated by any particular word or concept, casts some doubt on
&gt; the universality and actuality of what you are describing.  It seems that you
&gt; are more intent on the correct concept than on the actuality of what is
&gt; experienced in awakening.
">

I did not say that there is one most correct way to describe the awakened state
of being, I provided two of many ways to describe the complete essence of this
awakened state.

&gt; &gt;&gt;treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt; &gt;&gt;investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are: &quot;And what

I have no experience but only my understanding (for what it's worth)
of what the Buddha taught.  The only thing there is to awaken too is
nirvanna, the deathless, release from suffering.

"This is peace, this is exquisite - the resolution of all
fabrications, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the ending of
craving; dispassion; cessation; Nibbana."

- AN 3.32

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in other words, it implicates a possible
&gt; metaphysics.  what is the metaphysics of Buddhism beyond ending
&gt; suffering?  what is awakened to once ignorance has been defeated?
">

§ 2. "Both formerly &amp; now, it is only stress that I describe, and the
cessation of stress."

- SN 22.86

The Buddha described everything in terms of suffering (stress) and
it's cessation.  There are no metaphysics beyond that, at least in the
canon.  The closest you get is:

"There is that dimension where there is neither earth, nor water, nor
fire, nor wind; neither dimension of the infinitude of space, nor
dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, nor dimension of
nothingness, nor dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;
neither this world, nor the next world, nor sun, nor moon. And there,
I say, there is neither coming, nor going, nor stasis; neither passing
away nor arising: without stance, without foundation, without support
[mental object]. This, just this, is the end of stress."

- Ud 8.1

"There is, monks, an unborn - unbecome - unmade - unfabricated. If
there were not that unborn - unbecome - unmade - unfabricated, there
would not be the case that emancipation from the born - become - made
- fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an
unborn - unbecome - unmade - unfabricated, emancipation from the born
- become - made - fabricated is discerned."

(1) Whatever you are doing to make quoting not work, please quit doing it.
(2) The above paragraph is merely the end-result of awakening, and not at all
awaking itself. Too many people fail to make this distinction, and thus are
purity or emptiness bound instead of awakened.

Buddha did not explain Buddhism as clearly or succinctly as Zen explains
Buddhism. The ultimate measure of awakening is realization itself, not what
anyone ever said about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;again move in contrary directions. In the non-dual systems the task of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wisdom is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to break through the diversified appearances (or the appearance of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;diversity) in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;order to discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;phenomena,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while true
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman, the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;etc.).
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental unity
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they really
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;(yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;respect
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;plurality
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena, to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;gain
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the direction
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are: &quot;And
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;what
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such its
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,' one
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt; &gt; &gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt; &gt; &gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt; &gt; &gt; theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt; &gt; &gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt; &gt; &gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt; &gt; &gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,
&gt; &gt; &gt; a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Submitted for your disapproval... :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; -DaveK

&gt; &gt; however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but
&gt; &gt; what there is to awaken to.
&gt; &gt;The Buddha described everything in terms of suffering (stress) and
&gt; &gt;it's cessation.  There are no metaphysics beyond that, at least in the
&gt; &gt;canon.  The closest you get is:
&gt; &gt;&quot;There is that dimension where there is neither earth, nor water, nor
&gt; &gt;fire, nor wind; neither dimension of the infinitude of space, nor
&gt; &gt;dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, nor dimension of
&gt; &gt;nothingness, nor dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;
&gt; &gt;neither this world, nor the next world, nor sun, nor moon. And there,
&gt; &gt;I say, there is neither coming, nor going, nor stasis; neither passing
&gt; &gt;away nor arising: without stance, without foundation, without support
&gt; &gt;[mental object]. This, just this, is the end of stress.&quot;

&gt; (1) Whatever you are doing to make quoting not work, please quit doing it.
&gt; (2) The above paragraph is merely the end-result of awakening, and not at all
&gt; awaking itself. Too many people fail to make this distinction, and thus are
&gt; purity or emptiness bound instead of awakened.

Sorry if you are having problems reading any of my posts.  It looks ok
on my end, but google groups has been farking with things lately, so
who knows.

I agree with what you said in #2.  My point (unproven, untested, and
probably unprovable and untestable) is that descriptions of what
awakening is like are more likely to steer one away from awakening
than towards it.  Any descriptions will miss the mark, or be partial
at best.

The fact that you have said there is more than one way to describe it
somewhat illustrates this point.  The reason there are so many ways to
describe it is that not one of them is adequate in and of itself.  If
it could be perfectly described, and it the means for it's attainment
could be perfectly mapped out, everybody would have awakened by now.

The Buddha did not spend a lot of time talking about awakening in and
of itself.  I think that when he spoke of it he was trying to motivate
people to practice, but otherwise did not like to discuss it that
much.

I don't think anybody described Buddhism better than the Buddha, but
Buddhism is not all about "enlightenment or bust."  Keep in mind that
he also taught to people he knew were not going to awaken in this
lifetime.  From his perspective he was putting people in a better
position to awaken in future lifetimes, or at the very least he was
helping them live in a more harmonized way.  I am well aware that I
could die tomorrow never having awakened to my true nature but I do
not regret any of the practice I have done.

A description of the awaking experience itself is much closer to the actual
awakening experience than a description of the effect of the awakening
experience. The result of the awakening experience being the end of suffering,
is not itself the awakening experience.

One can end suffering by merely keeping one's mind empty, this is not at all the
same as the awakening experience. The awaking experience is much more like "the
truth that shall set you free" from Christianity. It is empirical proof the
fundamental way you thought reality worked was backwards.

&gt; I would say, Peter, that this is your terminology for that state or
&gt; experience of reality as it really is.  It is not the only way to
&gt; describe the awakened state, and it is not a way that I would prefer,
&gt;  because, as I have told you in the past, that is a kind of
&gt; terminology that smacks of intellectual understanding rather than a
&gt; direct description of what is.  &quot;no separation of subject and object&quot;
&gt; probably describes to you what awakening is like, but it is full of
&gt; concepts. Both &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; are concepts, so you have to
&gt; envision them, then erase them.  To me terms like &quot;no experience of
&gt; separate self&quot; or &quot;a state in which you are able to just be and
&gt; everything is obvious without any doubt about what to do&quot; or &quot;a state
&gt; of equanimity and non-attachment&quot; etc. etc. are more descriptive of
&gt; the reality of awakening.  &quot;non duality of subject and object&quot; seems
&gt; much more abstract and more removed from a real experience in the
&gt; moment.

&gt; is this because you are intellectual by nature and like to express
&gt; yourself in concepts?  Or is it because your awakening is very much
&gt; centered in your head and is a product of sorting out thoughts about
&gt;  reality until you discovered one that puts it all into an essential
&gt;  form?  I don't know, but I do think that &quot;non duality of subject and
&gt;  object&quot; may be a good starting point for a description of awakening
&gt;  realization, but not in itself a real description of anything that
&gt; can be easily grasped.

&gt; Furthermore, it seems like your certainty that this is the *one most
&gt;  correct way* to describe the awakened state and that this is the one
&gt;  property that characterizes it, rather than seeing it as one way to
&gt;  describe a state that cannot be encapsulated by any particular word
&gt; or concept, casts some doubt on the universality and actuality of
&gt; what you are describing.  It seems that you are more intent on the
&gt; correct concept than on the actuality of what is experienced in
&gt; awakening.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;once
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;again move in contrary directions. In the non-dual systems the task of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wisdom is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to break through the diversified appearances (or the appearance of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;diversity) in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;order to discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;phenomena,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;true
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman, Brahman,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void Nature of Mind,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;etc.).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;For such systems, liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;unity
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dew.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;really
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;(yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;respect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves diversity and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;plurality
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;gain
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;insight into their qualities and structures. It moves, not in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;direction
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;an all-embracing identification with the All, but toward disengagement
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;detachment, release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;undermines&quot; concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;treat them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;And
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is form, such
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;arising and passing away. Such is feeling... perception... formations...
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;consciousness, such its arising and passing away.&quot; &quot;When one sees, 'All
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;formations are impermanent, all are suffering, everything is not self,'
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;turns away from suffering: this is the path to purity.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I think he oversimplifies mahayana as describing the goal as seeking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; an &quot;underlying unity.&quot;  At least in Zen, I have not heard any such
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis on a &quot;one is all&quot; type thinking, even in teachings on non-
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; duality.  In fact it sounds like a comparative religion undergrad's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of Mahayana.   He's gotten it confused with Hinduism.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact I once heard Daido Roshi adamantly exclaim &quot;one is NOT all.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To speak of some such abstraction, as some such thing as an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;underlying unity&quot; is to create another kind of polarity.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings of nonduality are still about disengatement and detachment,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;release from the all&quot; or any concept of &quot;all.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Like I said before.  The truth of the difference between mahayana and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; theravada is nothing more to me than a matter of emphasis.  There is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; plenty of precedent for non-duality in the Pali canon in discussions
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of higher Jhanas and in discussions of awakening, but a term for &quot;non-
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; duality&quot; simply doesn't appear.  Theravada is a prescriptive practice,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a cure for ending suffering by ending the ignorance that prevents
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening.  Mahayana is the study of awakening in and of itself.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Submitted for your disapproval... :)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -DaveK

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; however, non-duality has to do not only with the method of awakening but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what there is to awaken to.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The Buddha described everything in terms of suffering (stress) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it's cessation.  There are no metaphysics beyond that, at least in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;canon.  The closest you get is:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;There is that dimension where there is neither earth, nor water, nor
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fire, nor wind; neither dimension of the infinitude of space, nor
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, nor dimension of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nothingness, nor dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;neither this world, nor the next world, nor sun, nor moon. And there,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I say, there is neither coming, nor going, nor stasis; neither passing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;away nor arising: without stance, without foundation, without support
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;[mental object]. This, just this, is the end of stress.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) Whatever you are doing to make quoting not work, please quit doing it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) The above paragraph is merely the end-result of awakening, and not at all
&gt; &gt;&gt; awaking itself. Too many people fail to make this distinction, and thus are
&gt; &gt;&gt; purity or emptiness bound instead of awakened.

&gt; &gt; Sorry if you are having problems reading any of my posts.  It looks ok
&gt; &gt; on my end, but google groups has been farking with things lately, so
&gt; &gt; who knows.

&gt; &gt; I agree with what you said in #2.  My point (unproven, untested, and
&gt; &gt; probably unprovable and untestable) is that descriptions of what
&gt; &gt; awakening is like are more likely to steer one away from awakening
&gt; &gt; than towards it.  Any descriptions will miss the mark, or be partial
&gt; &gt; at best.

&gt; A description of the awaking experience itself is much closer to the actual
&gt; awakening experience than a description of the effect of the awakening
&gt; experience. The result of the awakening experience being the end of suffering,
&gt; is not itself the awakening experience.
">

I don't know the difference between ending suffering (permanantly) and
realization.  But do you think it is better to incline oneself towards
awakening or towards the end of suffering? I ask becuase I think my
suffering has lessened as a result of my practice, but I don't know if
that makes me closer to awakening, and that doesn't bother me.

I think that many who incline themselves only towards awakening miss
out on a lot of the other fruits of practice, and become more bitter
and unstable in the process.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One can end suffering by merely keeping one's mind empty, this is not at all the
&gt; same as the awakening experience. The awaking experience is much more like &quot;the
&gt; truth that shall set you free&quot; from Christianity. It is empirical proof the
&gt; fundamental way you thought reality worked was backwards.
">

I suppose keeping one's mind empty would end suffering, but only for
the time one's mind was empty.  A permanent end to suffering would
entail a change in perspective that didn't require the mind being
empty for suffering to cease.  Sound right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Awakening is the direct experience of the {non duality of subject

&gt;&gt;&gt; direct seeing into self-nature}.

&gt;&gt; I would say, Peter, that this is your terminology for that state or
&gt;&gt; experience of reality as it really is.  It is not the only way to describe
&gt;&gt; the awakened state, and it is not a way that I would prefer,
&gt;&gt;  because, as I have told you in the past, that is a kind of
&gt;&gt; terminology that smacks of intellectual understanding rather than a
&gt;&gt; direct description of what is.  &quot;no separation of subject and object&quot;
&gt;&gt; probably describes to you what awakening is like, but it is full of
&gt;&gt; concepts. Both &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; are concepts, so you have to
&gt;&gt; envision them, then erase them.  To me terms like &quot;no experience of
&gt;&gt; separate self&quot; or &quot;a state in which you are able to just be and
&gt;&gt; everything is obvious without any doubt about what to do&quot; or &quot;a state
&gt;&gt; of equanimity and non-attachment&quot; etc. etc. are more descriptive of
&gt;&gt; the reality of awakening.  &quot;non duality of subject and object&quot; seems
&gt;&gt; much more abstract and more removed from a real experience in the
&gt;&gt; moment.

&gt;&gt; is this because you are intellectual by nature and like to express yourself
&gt;&gt; in concepts?  Or is it because your awakening is very much centered in your
&gt;&gt; head and is a product of sorting out thoughts about
&gt;&gt;  reality until you discovered one that puts it all into an essential
&gt;&gt;  form?  I don't know, but I do think that &quot;non duality of subject and
&gt;&gt;  object&quot; may be a good starting point for a description of awakening
&gt;&gt;  realization, but not in itself a real description of anything that
&gt;&gt; can be easily grasped.

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, it seems like your certainty that this is the *one most
&gt;&gt;  correct way* to describe the awakened state and that this is the one
&gt;&gt;  property that characterizes it, rather than seeing it as one way to
&gt;&gt;  describe a state that cannot be encapsulated by any particular word
&gt;&gt; or concept, casts some doubt on the universality and actuality of
&gt;&gt; what you are describing.  It seems that you are more intent on the
&gt;&gt; correct concept than on the actuality of what is experienced in
&gt;&gt; awakening.

&gt; What makes you think
&gt; awakening is an experience
&gt; that can be remembered?

Its like riding a bike once you know how to ride a bike, you can always get on a
bike and ride it again. Riding it again proves in that very same moment that you
know how to ride.
